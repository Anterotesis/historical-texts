            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

From premiſes which the ſacred ſcriptures afford, calculations may, with a good degree of preciſion, be made, reſpecting the time of the accompliſhment of the prophecies which relate to the future proſperity of the Zion of God. The redemption of the church of God from the bondage of Papal Babylon, as well as from the general dominion of the Powers of Darkneſs, is a glorious and animating ſubject of prophecy. The Lord hath ſpoken, and the decree ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>ought not to be paſſed by unnoticed—namely, the menaces of certain vengeance to be hereafter inflicted on the enemies of the true religion, intimated by the deſtruction of the body of the fourth beaſt; and</hi> ſubſequent to that <hi>the promiſe of the univerſal eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the reign of Chriſt, when</hi> the ſtone cut out of the mountain without hands, <hi>ſhall ſtrike and</hi> break to pieces the image on its ſect; <hi>and become a</hi> great mountain, and fill the whole earth. <hi>This part of the prophecies is yet unfulfilled; nor is it for us to aſcertain
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:026594_0005_0FD0B258E9284528"/>the manner in which ſo important a revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the religious world, will be effected: The uſe intended by the obſervation here is, from the ſymptoms of decline which are now diſcernible in the ſyſtem of the Papal pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to point out to you the preſumption that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes in favor of the truth of the prophetical de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciations, and from the concuſſions which have already ſhook the tottering throne of ſuperſtition, to learn to expect, in God's good time,</hi> its full and final demolition."</p>
                  <p>And if this celebrated Author, in his day, thought there was ground to uſe the following language, in view of prophecies already ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, and events then exiſting, with how much nore reaſon may we confidently adopt it now, and ſay, that, <hi>"under the auſpices of ſuch a guide we may hope to advance, ſecurely, in our projected work; and to have the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of thoſe, who, after long travelling in a dreary night, perceive, at laſt, the darkneſs to diminiſh, and the reddening ſtreaks of the morning, betokening to them, that the day is at hand?"—</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The object in publiſhing Dr. Bellamy's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe is to eſtabliſh the doctrine of the Millen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium as to matter of fact: and by publiſhing Preſident Edwards<hi>'s "Humble Attempt to
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:026594_0006_0FD0B25A9158CFA8"/>promote explicit Agreement and viſible U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in Prayer;"</hi> it is hoped attention will be excited to the uſe of thoſe means which God hath ordained to be uſed in view of a gracious fulfilment of <hi>every</hi> promiſe made to his Church and to his People. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, I will yet for this be enquired of by the houſe of Iſrael, to do it for them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The deſign of the third and laſt diſcourſe is to ſupport the objects of the two former, by an appeal to exiſting facts, to the demonſtration of preſent events. By theſe it appears, that what Dr. Hallifax termed <hi>"the reddening ſtreaks of the morning,"</hi> have become entitled to the ſtile of the <hi>dawn,</hi> if not to the <hi>morning</hi> of the day.—How does our faith grow—our confidence increaſe, and our joyful hearts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ult at the ſight, or rather at the ſound of the ſtately ſteppings of our God in the preſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions of his providence, fulfilling the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of his great decree!—From what we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to have, already, taken place, may we not confidently anticipate all that is to come?—<hi>The teſtimony of Jeſus,</hi> ſaith the angel to St. John, <hi>is a ſpirit of prophecy.</hi>—If, in a ſpirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, the Great Head of the Church hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of things to come, to ſtrengthen the faith, and to cheer the hope of his followers, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:026594_0007_0FD0B25C89DD3908"/>be denied, but our time and talents are well employed, whilſt, in ſtudy, with meekneſs and prayer, we labor to underſtand and to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs the bleſſings he hath ſo graciouſly prepared, and ſo abundantly promiſed to his Church.</p>
                  <p>If, in the day in which Preſident Edwards lived, it was thought time for the Zion of God to go into labor, in view of the approach of the time of promiſed redemption to Iſrael, with how much more courage and confidence may the Church of God now proceed in the ardu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, yet noble and intereſting work?</p>
                  <p>The arguments which his invaluable tract ſuggeſts for explicit Agreement and viſible U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of God's People in extraordinary Prayer, for the Revival of Religion, and the Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt's Kingdom on Earth, purſuant to Scripture-promiſes and Prophecies, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>LAST TIME,</hi> are as applicable to the ſtate of the Church, and of the world, now, as they were then, and the encouragement, from preſent circumſtances, much more animating.</p>

                  <p>IN a great variety of reſpects the Bible is the moſt remarkable book in the world. In it we have God's moral character clearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to view, by a hiſtory of his conduct, as moral governor of the world, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; and the nature of fallen man paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the life, by a hiſtory of their behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our for four thouſand years. In it we have opened the glorious and aſtoniſhing method that has been entered upon to diſappoint all
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:026594_0014_0FD0B2676D9FBBB8"/>Satan's deſigns, by the interpoſition of the Son of God; and are informed of his birth, life, death, reſurrection, aſcenſion and exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and of the glorious deſigns he has in view. And the whole is ſo contrived as to be admirably ſuited to all the circumſtances and needs of a good man, that, as it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to be the good man's book, in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar ſenſe, ſo it is perfectly ſuited to his caſe. <hi>It is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for inſtruction in righteouſneſs, that the man of God may be perfect, thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly furniſhed to all good works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That ſincere concern for the cauſe of truth and virtue, for the honor of God and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of true religion, which is peculiar to a good man, whoſe character it is to love Chriſt above father and mother, wife and children, houſes and lands, yea, better than his own life, muſt naturally ſubject him to a peculiar kind of ſolicitude; even as a child, of a truly filial ſpirit, is pained when it goes ill with his father's family, to whoſe intereſt he is cloſely attached, and has a whole ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of inward ſenſations that a ſtranger in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddles not with. The Bible, the good man's book, is, therefore, wiſely adapted to eaſe the good man's pained heart, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:026594_0015_0FD0B268AA47D270"/>conſolation in this intereſting and moſt important point, as it gives the ſtrongeſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances that the cauſe of virtue ſhall finally prevail.</p>
                  <p>How inſupportable muſt the grief of the pious Jews have been, ſitting on the ſides of the rivers of Babylon? <hi>There we ſat down,</hi> ſay they, <hi>yea, we wept when we remembered Zion.</hi> And on the willows they hung their harps, nor could any thing divert their minds. <hi>If I forget thee, O Jeruſalem, let my right hand forget her cunning! If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth!</hi> —How inſupportable, I ſay, muſt their grief have been, while their glorious holy tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and their holy city, the place of all their ſacred ſolemnities, were lying deſolate, and God's people in captivity, had it not been for that promiſe, ſo often repeated, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſeventy years God would viſit them, and cauſe them to return to their own land. God knew before-hand the anguiſh which would be apt to fill their hearts, the ſinking diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agements, and all the train of dark and gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my thoughts they would be incident to, and before-hand provided a remedy. Yea, no ſooner had he denounced their doom in the xxxixth chapter of Iſaiah, but immediately
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:026594_0016_0FD0B26A2EB96918"/>in the next chapter, and for ten or twenty chapters together, does he provide for their ſupport. <hi>Comfort ye, comfort ye, my people; ſpeak comfortably to Jeruſalem,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>So, how inſupportable would have been the grief of the church of Chriſt, through the long, dark, cruel reign of myſtical Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, while they beheld error and wickedneſs univerſally prevail, Satan getting his will in almoſt every thing, and, to appearance, no ſigns of better times, but all things wearing a dreadful aſpect before their eyes:—How great their grief? How ſinking their diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements? How almoſt inſuperable their temptations to apoſtatize, and forſake a cauſe that heaven ſeemed to forſake, had not the day of deliverance been expreſsly foretold, and the glory that ſhould follow opened to view by the ſpirit of propheſy? But in a firm belief that the cauſe they were engaged in, and for which they ſpilt their blood, would finally prevail, and prevail in this world, where they then beheld Satan reigning and triumphing; I ſay, in a firm belief of this, the whole army fo martyrs could march on to battle courageouſly, willing to ſacrifice their lives in the cauſe, not doubting of final victory, although they themſelves muſt fall in the field.</p>

Indeed, were the ſalvation of his own ſoul the only thing the good man had in view, he would naturally be quite eaſy upon a full aſſurance that this was ſecured.

But, attached as he was to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the God of Iſrael, nothing could give him ſatisfaction, but a proſpect that that would be ſecure. The welfare of himſelf and of his family was of no importance in his eſteem, compared with this. <hi>See Exod.</hi> xxxii.</p>
                  <p>It muſt, therefore, be remembered, that, as the Son of God leſt his father's boſom, and the realms of light and glory, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired on the croſs in the utmoſt viſible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, that he might ſpoil principalities and powers, bruiſe the ſerpent's head, deſtroy the works of the Devil, ſo his true diſciples have
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:026594_0018_0FD0B26D2679D2B0"/>imbibed a meaſure of the ſame ſpirit, and, as volunteers enliſted under his banner, have the ſame thing in view; they long for the deſtruction of Satan's kingdom, and theſe petitions are the genuine language of their hearts; <q>Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</q> Nor can the ſalvation of their own ſouls, although ever ſo ſafely ſecured, ſatisfy their minds, without a clear view and fair proſpect of Chriſt's final victory over all his enemies: <q>But if our great GENERAL, who has ſacrificed his life in the cauſe, may but at laſt obtain a complete victory, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the preſent dark appearances, this is enough," ſays the Chriſtian Soldier; I am willing to riſque all in his ſervice, and die in the battle too. But if Satan were always to carry the day, Oh, who could live under the thought!</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This having been the temper of good men, more or leſs, even from the early ages of the world, and through all ſucceſſive genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to this day, they have evidently want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a peculiar ſupport, which the reſt of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind ſtood in no need of, to carry them
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:026594_0019_0FD0B26EA86A34E8"/>comfortably through ſuch a long ſcene of darkneſs; wickedneſs prevailing, God diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honored, Satan triumping, the world pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing, the true church of God more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in ſackcloth. And accordingly the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal victory of the cauſe of truth and virtue was intimated in the very firſt promiſe made to fallen man; and, from time to time, God repeated this comfortable prediction to his church and people; and finally made it the chief ſubject of the laſt book of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he ordered to be wrote for the uſe of his church.</p>
                  <p>Now let us take a brief view of the whole ſeries of theſe divine predictions, from the beginning of the world, even down to this in our text, contained in one of the laſt chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the Bible, that we may ſee what full evidence there is of this truth, and ſo what abundant cauſe for conſolation to all the people of God.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Immediately after the fall, when the ſerpent, even the Old Serpent the Devil, had juſt ſeduced mankind to revolt from God; and had, to all appearance, laid this whole world in perpetual ruin, even in the depths of this midnight darkneſs, a ray of light
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:026594_0020_0FD0B2702997C420"/>ſhone down from heaven—<hi>The ſeed of the woman ſhall bruiſe the ſerpent's head.</hi> As if God had ſaid, <q>I ſee the ſcheme that Satan has laid to ruin the world, and eſtabliſh his impious, malicious cauſe: I ſee it, and am determined to defeat it. The feebler woman he has over-matched, but her al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty ſeed ſhall conquer him, and as ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually ſubdue him, and prevent all fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture miſchief by him, as a ſerpent is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued and incapacitated for further miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief when his head is cruſhed to pieces, under the indignant heel of one determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on his death.</q> This was a complete doom, indeed, denounced againſt Satan, at the head of the kingdom of darkneſs. And it fully implied, that the cauſe of light, truth and righteouſneſs, ſhould finally obtain a complete victory.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. After this gracious and glorious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe had been the chief foundation of all the hopes of God's people for two thouſand years, God was pleaſed to point out the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular family from whence this mighty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer ſhould ſpring, and to intimate what a univerſal bleſſing he ſhould be to all the nations of the earth. <hi>And in thy</hi> SEED <hi>ſhall</hi> ALL <hi>the families of the earth be bleſſed,</hi> ſaid
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:026594_0021_0FD0B271B6290938"/>God to Abraham; which again plainly ſuppoſed, that the cauſe of truth and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs, notwithſtanding the dark ſtate the world then was in, all ſinking faſt into idol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atry, and would for many ages be in, buried in heatheniſh darkneſs, ſhould yet, in due time, univerſally prevail over the whole earth. For <hi>in thy</hi> SEED <hi>ſhall</hi> ALL <hi>the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of the earth be bleſſed.</hi> This ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was repeated again and again to Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, and afterwards to Iſaac and to Jacob.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hitherto God had ſupported his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples' hopes chiefly with promiſes, with verbal predictions; but from the days of Moſes to the days of Solomon king of Iſrael, to aſſiſt his peoples' faith, God did, beſides repeated promiſes of the ſame thing, by a great variety of wonderful works, ſhadow forth the glorious day; and, at the ſame time, ſhew that he had ſufficient wiſdom and power to accompliſh the greateſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns. That his people might be convinced that he could eaſily bring to paſs, for the good of his church, whatſoever ſeemed good in his ſight.</p>
                  <p>Iſrael, in the Egyptian bondage, were a deſigned type of a fallen world, under the dominion and tyranny of Satan; nor was
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:026594_0022_0FD0B2732739CB38"/>Pharaoh more loth to let Iſrael go, than Satan is to have his ſubjects deſert him, and his kingdom go to ruin; but notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the ſeeming impoſſibilities in the way of Iſrael's deliverance, infinite wiſdom knew how to accompliſh the divine deſigns. God could even cauſe a member of Pharaoh's family to educate one to be an inſtrument of this deſigned deliverance. And, in due time, behold all the armies of Iſrael march forth from the land of Egypt, out of the houſe of bondage; and Pharaoh, and his chariots, and all his hoſt, lie buried in the Red Sea! So eaſily can God bring forth his people, even out of the anti-chriſtian kingdom, which is ſpiritually called Sodom and Egypt; and, if he pleaſes, raiſe up the inſtruments of this glorious work, even in the court of Rome.</p>
                  <p>And when the name of the true God was almoſt forgotten through all the earth, and the Devil worſhipped in his room, in idols of various names, through all the nations, God knew how to make his name known, and to cauſe his fame to ſpread abroad, and fill the whole earth with his glory, by won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders wrought in the land of Ham; by deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending on Mount Sinai; by leading the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:026594_0023_0FD0B27567ED40A0"/>armies of Iſrael forty years in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in a pillar of cloud by day, and of fire by night, giving them bread from heaven and water out of the flinty rock; dividing Jordan; delivering up one and thirty idol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atrous kings to the ſword of Joſhua; raiſing up judges, one after another, in a miraculous manner, to deliver his people, until the days of David and Solomon, types of Chriſt.—Of David who, Meſſiah-like, ſubdued the enemies of Iſrael all around; of Solomon, who built the Holy Temple, and filled Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem with riches and glory.—He who hath done all theſe things, can eaſily accompliſh all the deſigns of his heart, preſerve his church, raiſe up deliverance, break to pieces the kingdoms of the earth for her ſake, make truth victorious, and ſet up the New-Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem in all her ſpiritual glory, build up his church as a glorious Holy Temple, and ſet the Son of David upon the Throne; by whoſe hands Satan, and all the powers of darkneſs, ſhall be ſubdued, chained, ſealed up in the bottomleſs pit, as much afraid, and as much unable, to attempt any miſchief, as the ſubdued nations around Iſrael were in the very height of David's power.</p>
                  <p>But when ſhall the Son of David reign,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:026594_0024_0FD0B27647837E10"/>and the church have reſt? When ſhall the cauſe of truth and righteouſneſs thus prevail? Perhaps the very time was deſigned to be ſhadowed forth in the law of Moſes, in the inſtitution of their holy days. The <hi>ſeventh day,</hi> ſaid God, who always had this glorious ſeaſon of reſt in view—<hi>"The ſeventh day ſhall be a Sabbath of Reſt, the ſeventh month ſhall be full of holy day, the ſeventh year ſhall be a year of reſt."</hi>—So, perhaps, after ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years are ſpent in labour and ſorrow by the church of God, the ſeven thouſandth ſhall be a ſeaſon of ſpiritual reſt and joy, an holy ſabbath to the Lord.—And as God the Creator was ſix days in forming a confuſed chaos into a beautiful world, and reſted the ſeventh; ſo God the Redeemer, after ſix thouſand years labour in the work of the new creation, may reſt on the ſeventh, and then proclaim a general liberty to an enſlav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed world, and grant a general pardon to a guilty race; as in the year of jubilee, among the Jews, every enſlaved Jew was ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and the debts of all the indebted were cancelled.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Theſe things, thus ſhadowed forth in types, were alſo expreſly declared by the mouths of the ancient prophets, from the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:026594_0025_0FD0B277A9BD8818"/>days of David and forward, to the end of that diſpenſation; and the ſame things are hinted here and there in the New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and largely opened to view in the Revelation of St. John. So that both the Old and New Teſtaments join to raiſe in us, who live in theſe ages, the higheſt aſſurance that it is God's deſign to <hi>give his Son the Heathen for his inheritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the earth for his poſſeſſion. For all kings ſhall bow down before him and all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhall ſerve him. And the mountain of the Lord's houſe ſhall be eſtabliſhed in the top of the mountains, and ſhall be exalted above the hills, and all nations ſhall flow unto it. They ſhall beat their ſwords into plough-ſhears and their ſpears into pruning-hooks, and learn war no more. For the earth ſhall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the ſea. A nation ſhall be born in a day. All thy people ſhall be righteous. They ſhall all know the Lord, from the leaſt to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt. And holineſs to the Lord ſhall be written on every thing. Kings ſhall become nurſing fathers, and queens nurſing mothers; and there ſhall be nothing to hurt or offend.

They were not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed when the Jews were brought out of their Babyloniſh captivity; for, from thence to the coming of Chriſt, they never were in ſo flouriſhing a ſtate as they had been before. They were not accompliſhed in the apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic age; for St. John, when moſt, if not all, of the other apoſtles were dead, ſpake of theſe things, in the Revelation, as yet to come to paſs. They were not accompliſhed in the three firſt centuries, for that was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt one continued ſcene of blood.

When then ſhall they be accompliſhed? Not till <hi>the holy city has been trodden under foot forty and two months.</hi> Not till <hi>the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes have propheſied a thouſand two hundred and threeſcore days, cloathed in ſackcloth.</hi> And not till <hi>the woman has been in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs a time, and times, and half a time.</hi> Now a time, and times, and half a time, <hi>i. e.</hi> three years and a half is equal to forty-two months, which is equal to one thouſand two hundred and ſixty days, which doubtleſs means one thouſand two hundred and ſixty years, a day for a year; as the event has proved, was the caſe in the prophecy of Daniel, who declared it to be ſeventy weeks, from the going forth of the commandment to build Jeruſalem to the death of Chriſt; for it proved to be four hundred and nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years, which is ſeven times ſeventy, a day for a year. <hi>Dan.</hi> ix. 24.</p>

And it was a long time from this before they got to the height of their grandeur, and the Pope was conſtituted a TEMPORAL PRINCE, which was not till A.

And as now he has been fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling two hundred and forty years, even ever ſince the beginning of the REFORMATION, ſo we may rationally expect he will conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to fall till BABYLON ſinks AS A MILL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STONE INTO THE SEA. And then <hi>the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and the hills ſhall break forth into ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and all the trees of the field ſhall clap their hands.</hi> And all the hoſts of heaven, as loud as thunder, ſhall ſay, <hi>Hallelujah!

Inſtead of being diſcouraged, from a view of the paſt, or the preſent ſtate of the world, as without the light of divine revelation we ſhould naturally have been, methinks now, viewing all things in the light of holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it muſt be perfectly rational to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that all theſe things are only prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory, as an introduction to the glorious day: even, as all the cruel bondage of Iſrael in Egypt, and all the haughty conduct of Pharaoh, were but preparatory as an intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to the glorious event that God had then in his eye. And what unſpeakable ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour will redound to God moſt High, if after all the vile conduct of this apoſtate world, and notwithſtanding all their ill-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert; and after all the ſubtle methods Satan has taken to make his kingdom ſtrong; I ſay, what unſpeakable honour will redound to God moſt High, if, after all this, he ſhould accompliſh his glorious deſigns? And when things have been ripening theſe five or ſix thouſand years, and are now ſo nearly every way prepared for God, to get himſelf a great name in the total deſtruction of Satan's king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, can we once imagine, that God will let the opportunity ilip? Or rather, ought
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:026594_0036_0FD0B288286C1948"/>we not firmly to believe, that when every thing is quite ripe, then God will ariſe, make bare his arm, and fill the whole world with his glory?</p>
                  <p>Eſpecially, conſidering that, as things ſtand, the honour of all his glorious perfections lies at ſtake; for ever ſince the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty gave out the word, that <hi>the</hi> SEED <hi>of the woman ſhould bruiſe the ſerpent's head,</hi> even from that very day, that Old Serpent, with all his ſubtilty, has employed his whole power to defeat the divine deſigns, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his kingdom in the world, and eſcape the dreadful blow. He ſtirred up Cain to kill his brother, and never ceaſed till the whole earth was filled with violence, which brought on the general deluge; and after the flood, he was induſtrious to divert man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind from the knowledge and worſhip of the true God, and to eſtabliſh idolatry and the worſhip of the Devil, in all the kingdoms of the earth; and ſince Chriſtianity ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, he has turned himſelf into every ſhape to defeat the gracious deſigns of the goſpel, and has prevailed and reigned above a thouſand years, at the head of the grand antichriſtian apoſtacy; and ſhould the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:026594_0037_0FD0B289DB332A50"/>ſuffer him to go on and proſper, and finally prevail, what would become of his own great name? and how great would be their triumph in the infernal regions, to think that in ſpite of God and of his Son, from the beginning to the end of the world, they have held out in a conſtant war, kept the field, and at laſt come off victorious?— Wherefore, as when God repeats the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful works which he had done for Iſrael in the days of old, in the xxth chapter of Ezekiel, he conſtantly ſays, <hi>I wrought for mine own great name.</hi> So here, in this caſe, will he do it again, and that in the moſt eminent manner; as it is written, <hi>The zeal of the Lord of Hoſts will perform this.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that, in a word, if almighty power and infinite wiſdom, at the head of the univerſe, infinitely engaged, are a ſufficient match for the guilty, impotent powers of darkneſs, then we may depend upon it, Satan will meet with an overthrow, as notable as did Pharaoh and his hoſt in the Red Sea;— and as proud Babylon, once the miſtreſs of kingdoms, is now no more, ſo myſtical Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon ſhall ſink as a millſtone in the ſea, and riſe no more for ever.

Some indeed underſtand the thouſand years in the Revelation, agreeable to other prophetical numbers in that book, a day for a year; ſo <hi>the time, and times, and half a time,</hi> i. e. three years and an half, and the <hi>forty two months,</hi> and the <hi>one thouſand two hundred and ſixty days</hi> are no doubt to be reckoned; and if the dark period is to be reckoned by this rule, it ſhould ſeem that the light period ſhould likewiſe; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the dark period, which in that book is repreſented to be the ſhorteſt, will indeed be the longeſt—the one thouſand two hundred and ſixty days longer than the thouſand years; and if the thouſand years is reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a day for a year, as the ſcripture-year con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains three hundred and ſixty days, ſo the one thouſand years will amount to three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſixty thouſand years; in which there might be millions ſaved to one that has been loſt.

But at this rate, there will be time enough in a thouſand years to double twenty times, which would produce ſuch a multitude of people, as that although we ſhould ſuppoſe all who live before the Millennium begins to be loſt, yet if all theſe ſhould be ſaved, there would be above ſeventeen thouſand ſaved to one that would be loſt; as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from the table below.<note place="bottom">

                     </p>
                     <p>Surely it is infinitely unbecoming the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of him who is <hi>King of Kings and Lord of Lords,</hi> to turn aſide to earthly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, or to ſink down in unmanly diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, or to give way to ſloth and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minacy, when there is ſo much to be done, and the glorious day is coming on. How ſhould thoſe who handle the pen of the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:026594_0052_0FD0B29F0CB9BC78"/>exert themſelves to explain and vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate divine truths, and paint the Chriſtian Religion in all its native glories! How ſhould the pulpit be animated, from Sabbath to Sabbath, with ſermons full of knowledge and light, full of ſpirit and life, full of zeal for God and love to men, and tender pity to infatuated ſinners! Chriſt loves to have his miniſters faithful, whether the wicked will hear or not.—And let pious parents be unwearied in their prayers for, and inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their children, and never faint un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any diſcouragements; as knowing, that Chriſt is exalted to give repentance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, and can do it for whom he will. Bring your children and friends, with all their ſpiritual diſeaſes, and lay them at his feet; as once they did their ſick, when this kind Saviour dwelt upon earth.—Let pious perſons of every age, and in every ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, awake from ſleep, and ariſe from the dead, and live and act worthy their glorious character and high expectations; and in their ſeveral ſtations exert themſelves to the utmoſt to promote the Redeemer's glorious cauſe.—Let this age do their ſhare, as Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, although the temple was not to be built in his day, yet exerted himſelf to lay up
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:026594_0053_0FD0B2A026D62F38"/>materials for that magnificent edifice, on which his heart was intently ſet; as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, in his ſon's day, it would be ſet up in all its glory.—So let us riſe up, and with the greateſt alacrity, contribute our utmoſt towards this building, this living temple, this temple all made of lively ſtones, of ſtones alive, in which God is to dwell, and which will infinitely exceed in glory the Temple of Solomon, that was built of dead timber and lifeleſs ſtones.—And let this be our daily prayer, an anſwer to which we may be aſſured of, whatever other requeſts are denied us, <hi>Our Father which art in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> &amp;c.—<hi>for thine is the kingdom, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the glory, for ever.</hi> AMEN.</p>

                     <hi>IF</hi> any enquire why the enſuing work is republiſhed, I would beg leave to lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them the following intelligence:</p>
                  <p>At an aſſociation of the miniſters and meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers of the Baptiſt churches in the counties of Northampton, Leiceſter, &amp;c. held at Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham, in the year <hi>1784,</hi> a reſolution was formed to eſtabliſh, through the aſſociation, <hi>a meeting of prayer for the GENERAL revival and ſpread of religion.</hi> This was to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the firſt Monday evening in every ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendar month, by all the churches. It ſtill continues.—In <hi>1786,</hi> another Baptiſt aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, commonly called the <hi>Midland,</hi> held that year at Aulceſter, in the county of Warwick, entered into the ſame reſolution. Many other churches, particularly in Yorkſhire, have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted, and now follow the above practice.—
<pb n="liv" facs="unknown:026594_0056_0FD0B2A4F36C1000"/>We have the pleaſure alſo to find, that ſeveral <hi>Paedo-Baptiſt</hi> churches ſtatedly meet on thoſe evenings, for the ſame purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>The re-publication of the following work, is with the avowed deſign of promoting the above agreement and practice. Thoſe concerned in its firſt inſtitution, never intended it ſhould be confined to any peculiar connection, or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular denomination. Rather they ardently wiſhed it might become general among the real friends of truth and holineſs. The advocates of error are indefatigable in their endeavours to overthrow the diſtinguiſhing and intereſting doctrines of Chriſtianity; thoſe doctrines which are the grounds of our hope, and ſources of our joy. Surely it becomes the followers of Chriſt, to uſe every effort, in order to ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the things which remain.</p>
                  <p>By re-publiſhing the following work, I do not conſider myſelf as becoming anſwerable for every ſentiment it contains. An author and an editor are very diſtinct characters. Should any entertain different views reſpecting ſome of the prophecies in the inſpired page, from thoſe that are here advanced, yet ſuch may, and I hope will, approve of the general deſign.</p>
                  <p>In the preſent imperfect ſtale, we may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably expect a diverſity of ſentiments upon religious matters. Each ought to think for
<pb n="lv" facs="unknown:026594_0057_0FD0B2A6277D3120"/>himſelf; and every one has a right, on proper occaſions, to ſhew his opinion. Yet all ſhould remember, that there are but two parties in the world, each engaged in oppoſite cauſes; the cauſe of God and of Satan; of holineſs and of ſin; of heaven and hell. The advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the one, and the down fall of the other, muſt appear exceedingly deſirable to every real friend of God and man. If ſuch, in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects entertain different ſentiments, and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe diſtinguiſhing modes of worſhip, ſurely they may unite in the above buſineſs. O for thouſands upon thouſands, divided into ſmall bands in their reſpective cities, towns, villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and neighbourhood, all met at the ſame time, and in purſuit of one end, offering up their united prayers, like ſo many aſcending clouds of incenſe before the Moſt High! May he ſhower down bleſſings on all the ſcattered tribes of Zion! Grace, great grace be with all them that love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty! <hi>AMEN!</hi>

                  <head>THE <hi>PREFACE.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THE ruin of Satan's miſerable kingdom, and the advancement of the univerſal and happy reign of Chriſt on the earth, were included and hinted in the ſentence denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced on the ſerpent, that the <hi>ſeed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhould bruiſe his head.</hi> What was a terrible threatening to Satan, in the ſurprized ears of our firſt guilty parents, implied a joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful prophecy, to keep them from deſpair, and enliven their hopes for themſelves and their deſcendants, of obtaining by this ſeed of her's an eternal triumph over him who had ſo ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foiled them. And it is likely, their hopes and faith immediately aroſe, laid hold on the reviving prophecy, earneſtly deſired its hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py accompliſhment, and tranſmitted it to their poſterity.</p>
                  <p>But though this prophecy was at firſt only delivered in the form of a threatening to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan; it was afterwards directly given in the form of a promiſe to Abraham, though ſtill in general terms, that <hi>in his ſeed ſhould all
<pb n="lviii" facs="unknown:026594_0059_0FD0B2AA46E18150"/>the nations of the earth be bleſſed.</hi> Yet this general promiſe was more clearly by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees explained in the following ages, to mean a Divine King, no other than the Son of God aſſuming human nature of the ſeed of Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob and David; that ſhould be born of a virgin in Bethlehem of Judah; and at firſt deſpiſed, abuſed, rejected, and put to death; but ſhould riſe to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal life, aſcend to heaven, and thence extend his bleſſed kingdom over all nations; not by outward force, but inward overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing influence, by his word and ſpirit, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them <hi>his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>illing people in the day of his power;</hi> and reigning in glorious light and holineſs, and love and peace for ever; and the advancement of this univerſal and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py reign has been the earneſt deſire and prayer of the ſaints in all ages to the preſent day.</p>
                  <p>But how great the honour and how lively the encouragement given in ſcripture to thoſe their prayers; by repreſenting them as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by Chriſt himſelf with the fragrant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe of his own merits and interceſſion, on the <hi>golden altar before the throne,</hi> and aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together in one grateful perfume to God! And how cheering to every ſaint is that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="lix" facs="unknown:026594_0060_0FD0B2AB2C0A9110"/>of his—<hi>From the riſing of the ſun, even to the going down of the ſame, my name ſhall be great among the Gentiles, and in every place incenſe ſhall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering!</hi> How pleaſing to God and the heavenly hoſts to ſee, as the ſun goes round the globe, this grateful incenſe riſing from every part on high! and the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive and inceſſant are theſe prayers, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending from the circle of the earth, the more does this bleſſed promiſe go into its deſired fulfilment, and the holy God is more pleaſed and glorified.</p>
                  <p>To promote the increaſe, concurrency, and conſtancy of theſe acceptable prayers, is the great intention both of the pious me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial of our reverend and dear brethren in Scotland, and of the worthy author of this exciting eſſay. And this deſign we cannot but recommend to all who deſire the coming of this bliſsful kingdom in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed extent and glory, in this wretched world.</p>
                  <p>As to the author's ingenious obſervations on the prophecies, we entirely leave them to the reader's judgment: with only obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though it is the apprehenſion of many learned men, that there is to be a very ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="lx" facs="unknown:026594_0061_0FD0B2AC2AB5B358"/>ſlaughter of the witneſſes of Chriſt about the time of their finiſhing their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to the pure worſhip and truths of the goſpel, about three or four years before the ſeventh angel ſounds his trumpet for the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in of Antichriſt;—yet we cannot ſee that this is any juſt objection againſt our joint and earneſt prayers for the glorious age ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, or for the haſtening of it.</p>
                  <p>For if ſuch a terrible time is coming in Europe, which we in depending America are likely to ſhare in; the more need we have of joining in earneſt and conſtant prayers for extraordinary ſuffering graces for ourſelves and others. And that ſuch a time is coming on the members of Chriſt, is no more an objection againſt their prayers for the haſtening of the following glory, than it was before the incarnation of him their head, that his moſt bitter ſufferings were to precede the ſpreading of this joyous kingdom among the nations. And the nearer the day approaches, the more need we have to be awakened to continual watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and prayer.</p>
                  <p>May God pour out on all his people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly, the ſpirit of grace and ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and prepare them for the amazing
<pb n="lxi" facs="unknown:026594_0062_0FD0B2AE473346E8"/>changes haſtening on the earth, both for previous trials and for following glories!</p>

                  <p>IN this chapter we have a prophecy of a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture glorious advancement of the church of God; wherein it is evident, ſomething further is intended than ever was fulfilled to the nation of the Jews under the Old Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament. For here are plain prophecies of ſuch things as never were fulfilled before the coming of the Meſſiah; partic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ly what is ſaid in the two laſt verſes in the chapter, of <hi>many people and ſtrong nations worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and ſeeking the true God,</hi> and of ſo great an acceſſion of Gentile nations to the church of God, that by far the greater part of the viſible worſhippers of God ſhould conſiſt of this new acceſſion, ſo that they ſhould be to the other as <hi>ten to one</hi>—a certain number
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:026594_0065_0FD0B2B32A7A8AD0"/>for an uncertain. There never happened any thing, from the time of the prophet Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariah to the coming of Chriſt, to anſwer this prophecy; and it can have no fulfilment but either in the calling of the Gentiles, in and after the days of the apoſtles, or in the future glorious enlargement of the church of God in the latter ages of the world, ſo often foretold by the prophets of the Old Teſtament, and by the prophet Zechariah in particular, in the latter part of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy. It is moſt probable, that what the ſpirit of God has chief reſpect to, is that laſt and greateſt enlargement and moſt glorious advancement of the church of God on earth, in the benefits of which eſpecially the Jewiſh nation were to have a ſhare, and a very e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent and diſtinguiſhing ſhare. There is a great agreement between what is here ſaid and other prophecies, that muſt manifeſtly have reſpect to the church's latter-day-glory; as that in Iſaiah lx. 2, 3, 4. <hi>The Lord ſhall ariſe upon thee, and his glory ſhall be ſeen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee; and the Gentiles ſhall come to thy light, and kings to the brightneſs of thy riſing. Laſt up thine eyes round about, and ſee; all they gather themſelves together, they come to thee.</hi> That whole chapter, beyond all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:026594_0066_0FD0B2B48E50F678"/>has reſpect to the moſt glorious ſtate of the church of God on earth. So chap. lxvi. 8. <hi>Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day? Shall a nation be born at once?</hi>—verſe 10. <hi>Rejoice ye with Jeruſalem, and be glad with her, all ye that love her.</hi>— verſe 12. <hi>I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the Gentiles like a flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtream.</hi>—Mich. iv. at the beginning: <hi>but in the laſt day it ſhall come to paſs, that the mountain of the houſe of the Lord ſhall be eſtabliſhed in the top of the mountain, and it ſhall be exalted above the hills, and people ſhall flow unto it; and many nations ſhall come and ſay, come, and let us go up unto the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Lord, and to the houſe of the God of Jacob. And he ſhall judge among many people, and rebuke ſtrong nations afar off; and they ſhall beat their ſwords into plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhares, and their ſpears into pruning-hooks; nation ſhall not lift up ſword againſt nation, neither ſhall they learn war any more.</hi>—See alſo, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ii. at the beginning. There has been nothing yet brought to paſs in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to anſwer theſe prophecies.

<pb n="66" facs="unknown:026594_0067_0FD0B2B6A7A450C0"/>to think it has a reſpect to the ſame times. And indeed there is a remarkable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement in the deſcription given through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the chapter, with the repreſentations made of thoſe times elſewhere in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, as may be ſeen by comparing ver. 3. with <hi>Iſaiah</hi> lx. 14.—ver. 4. with <hi>Iſaiah</hi> lxv. 20, 22. and xxxiii. 24.—ver. 6, 7, 8. with <hi>Ezek.</hi> xxxvii. 2, 11, 12, 21.—ver. 7. with <hi>Iſaiah</hi> xliii. 5, 6. and xlix. 12. and lix. 19. —ver. 12, 13. with <hi>Hoſea</hi> ii. 21, 22. and <hi>Ezek.</hi> xxxiv. 22—29.—ver. 8, 12, 13. with <hi>Ezek.</hi> xxxvi. 28—30.—ver. 13. with <hi>Zeph.</hi> iii. 20. and <hi>Iſaiah</hi> xix. 24.—ver. 19. with <hi>Iſaiah</hi> lxi. 3. and <hi>Jer.</hi> xxxi. 12, 13, 14.</p>
                  <p>So that however the prophet, in ſome things that are ſaid in this chapter, may have reſpect to future ſmiles of heaven on the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Jews, lately returned from the Babyloniſh captivity, and reſettled in the land of Canaan, in a great increaſe of their numbers and wealth, and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="67" facs="unknown:026594_0068_0FD0B2B6ABED2DA0"/>ſpeaking of the favours and bleſſings of God on the Jews, attending or following their return from the Babyloniſh captivity, the ſpirit of God takes occaſion from thence to ſpeak of the incomparably greater bleſſings on the church, that ſhall attend and follow her deliverance from the ſpiritual or myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Babylon, of which thoſe were a type; and is, as it were, led away to ſpeak almoſt wholly of theſe latter, and vaſtly greater things, ſo as to ſeem to forget the former.</p>
                  <p>And whereas the prophet, in this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſpeaks of God's <hi>bringing his people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain from the eaſt and weſt to Jeruſalem,</hi> (ver. 7, 8.) <hi>And multitudes of all nations taking hold of the ſkirts of the Jews;</hi> ſo far as we may ſuppoſe that this means literally that nation of the poſterity of Jacob, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have chief reſpect to any return of the Jews from Babylon and other countries in thoſe ancient times before Chriſt, for no ſuch things as are here ſpoken of, attended any ſuch return; but it muſt have reſpect to the great calling and gathering of the Jews in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fold of Chriſt, and their being receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the bleſſings of his kingdom, after the fall of Antichriſt, or the deſtruction of myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Babylon.</p>

In the text we have an account how this future glorious advancement of the church of God ſhould be brought on, or introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, viz. By great multitudes in different towns and countries taking up a joint reſolution, and coming into an expreſs and viſible a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, that they will, by united and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary prayer, ſeek to God that he would come and manifeſt himſelf, and grant the tokens and fruits of his gracious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.—Particularly we may obſerve,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The duty with the attendance on which the glorious event foretold ſhall be brought on, viz. The duty of prayer.—Prayer, ſome ſuppoſe, is here to be taken ſynechdochical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for the whole of the worſhip of God— prayer being a principal part of the worſhip of the church of God in the days of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, when ſacrifices are aboliſhed; and ſo, that this is to be underſtood only as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of a great revival of religion, and of the true worſhip of God among his viſible people, the acceſſion of others to the church, and turning of multitudes from idolatry to the worſhip of the true God. But it appears to me reaſonable, to ſuppoſe, that ſomething more ſpecial is intended, with regard to the duty of prayer; conſidering that prayer is
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:026594_0070_0FD0B2B9E007A948"/>here expreſsly and repeatedly mentioned; and alſo conſidering how parallel this place is with many other prophecies, that ſpeak of an extraordinary ſpirit of prayer, as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding and introducing that glorious day of revival of religion, and advancement of the church's peace and proſperity, ſo often fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, (which I ſhall have occaſion to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hereafter) and particularly the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of what is here ſaid, with what is ſaid afterwards by the ſame prophet, of the <hi>pouring out of a ſpirit of grace and ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> as that with which this great revival of religion ſhall begin, chap. xii. 10.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The good, that ſhall be ſought by prayer; which is God himſelf.—It is ſaid once and again, <hi>They ſhall go to pray before the Lord, and to ſeek the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> This is the good they aſk for and ſeek by prayer, <hi>The Lord of Hoſts</hi> himſelf.—To ſeek God, as the expreſſion may, perhaps, be ſometimes uſed in ſcripture, may ſignify no more than ſeeking the favour or mercy of God. And if it be taken ſo here, <hi>praying before the Lord,</hi> and <hi>ſeeking the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> muſt be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as ſynonymous expreſſions. And it muſt be confeſſed to be a common thing in ſcripture, to ſignify the ſame thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly,
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:026594_0071_0FD0B2BB2B147910"/>by various expreſſions of the ſame import, for the greater emphaſis.—But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly that expreſſion of <hi>ſeeking the Lord,</hi> is very commonly uſed to ſignify ſomething more than merely, in general, to ſeek ſome mercy of God: It implies that God himſelf is the great good deſired and ſought after; that the bleſſings purſued are God's gracious preſence, the bleſſed manifeſtations of him, union and intercourſe with him; or, in ſhort, God's manifeſtations and communications of himſelf by his Holy Spirit. Thus the pſalmiſt deſired God, thirſted after him, and ſought him. <hi>O God, thou art my God; ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ly will I ſeek thee. My fleſh longeth for thee, in a dry and thriſty land, were no water is, to ſee thy power and thy glory, ſo as I have ſeen thee in the ſanctuary.—My ſoul followeth hard after thee.—Whom have I in heaven but thee? And there is none upon earth that I deſire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thee.</hi> The pſalmiſt earneſtly purſued after God, <hi>his ſoul thirſted after him, he ſtretched forth his hands unto him,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore it is in ſcripture the peculiar cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the ſaints, that they are <hi>thoſe that ſeek God. This is the generation of them that ſeek him. Your heart ſhall live that ſeek God.</hi> And in many other places. If the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:026594_0072_0FD0B2BDB29E4850"/>in the text be underſtood agreeably to this ſenſe, then by ſeeking the Lord of Hoſts, we muſt underſtand a ſeeking that God, who had withdrawn, or as it were hid himſelf, for a long time, would return to his church, and grant the tokens and fruits of his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious preſence, and thoſe bleſſed communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of his ſpirit to his people, and to mankind on the earth, which he had often promiſed, and which his church had long waited for.</p>
                  <p>And it ſeems reaſonable to underſtand the phraſe, <hi>ſeeking the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> in this ſenſe here, and not as merely ſignifying the ſame thing with praying to God; not only becauſe the expreſſion is repeatedly added to praying before the Lord, in the text, as ſignifying ſomething more; but alſo becauſe the phraſe, taken in this ſenſe, is exactly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to other parallel prophetic repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations. Thus God's people's ſeeking, by earneſt prayer, the promiſed reſtoration of the church of God, after the Babyloniſh captivity, and the great apoſtacy that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned it. is called their <hi>ſeeking God, and ſearching for him;</hi> and God's granting this promiſed revival and reſtoration is called his being <hi>found of them. For thus ſaith the Lord,
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:026594_0073_0FD0B2BE294B7CC8"/>that after ſeventy years be accompliſhed at Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, I will viſit you, and perform my good word towards you, in cauſing you to return to this place. For I know the thoughts that I think towards you, ſaith the Lord, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed end. Then ſhall ye go and call upon me, and I will hearken unto you; and ye ſhall ſeek me and find me, when ye ſhall ſearch for me with all your heart; and I will be found of you, ſaith the Lord, and I will turn away your captivity.</hi> And the prophets, from time to time, repreſent God, in a low and afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtate of his church, as being withdrawn, and hiding himſelf. <hi>Verily thou art a God that hideſt thyſelf, O God of Iſrael, the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. I hid me, and was wroth.</hi> And they repreſent God's people, while his church is in ſuch a ſtate, before God delivers and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtores the ſame, as ſeeking him, looking for him, ſearching and waiting for him, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling after him. <hi>I will go and return unto my place, 'till they acknowledge their offence, and ſeek my face from the houſe of Jacob, and I will look for him.</hi> And when God, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to their prayers and ſucceeding their endeavors, delivers, reſtores, and advances his church, according to his promiſe, then
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:026594_0074_0FD0B2C02FB54D78"/>he is ſaid to anſwer, and come, and ſay, here am I, and to ſhew himſelf; and they are ſaid to find him, and ſee him plainly. <hi>Then ſhalt thou cry, and he ſhall ſay,</hi> HERE I AM. <hi>But Iſrael ſhall be ſaved in the Lord, with an everlaſting ſalvation. I ſaid not unto the ſeed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain. The Lord will wipe away the tears from off all faces, and the rebuke of his people ſhall he take away from off the earth. And it ſhall be ſaid in that day, Lo, this is our God, we have waited for him, and he will ſave us: This is the Lord, we have waited for him; we will be glad, and rejoice in his ſalvation. We have waited for thee: The deſire of our ſoul is to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee. With my ſoul have I deſired thee in the night; yea, with my ſpirit within me will I ſeek thee early. For when thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteouſneſs. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my people ſhall know my name; therefore they ſhall know in that day, that I am he that doth ſpeak: behold,</hi> IT IS I. <hi>How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publiſheth peace, that bringeth good tidings of good, that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſheth ſalvation, that ſaith unto Zion—Thy

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. We may obſerve who they are, that ſhall be united in thus ſeeking the Lord of Hoſts; <hi>the inhabitants of many cities,</hi> and of many countries, <hi>yea, many people and ſtrong nations;</hi> great multitudes in different parts of the world ſhall conſpire in this buſineſs. From the repreſentation made in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, it appears rational to ſuppoſe, that it will be fulfilled ſomething after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner —Firſt, that there ſhall be given much of a ſpirit of prayer to God's people, in many places, diſpoſing them to come into an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs agreement, unitedly to pray to God in an extraordinary manner, that he would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear for the help of his church, and in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to mankind, and pour out his Spirit, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive his work, and advance his ſpiritual kingdom in the world, as he has promiſed; and that this diſpoſition to ſuch prayer, and union in it, will gradually ſpread more and more, and increaſe to greater degrees; with which at length will gradually be introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a revival of religion, and a diſpoſition to greater engagedneſs in the worſhip and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:026594_0076_0FD0B2C2A720EC08"/>of God, amongſt his profeſſing people; that this being obſerved will be the means of awakening others, making them ſenſible of the wants of their ſouls, and exciting in them a great concern for their ſpiritual and ever<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus after the inhabitants of many cities of Iſrael, or of God's profeſſing peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, have taken up, and purſued a joint re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, to go and pray before the Lord, and ſeek the Lord of Hoſts, others ſhall be drawn to worſhip and ſerve him with them; till at length many people and ſtrong na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhall join themſelves to them; and there ſhall, in proceſs of time, be a vaſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to the church, ſo that it ſhall be ten times as large as it was before; yea, at length all nations ſhall be converted unto God.—
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:026594_0077_0FD0B2C42E845728"/>Thus ten men ſhall take hold, out of all lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages of the nations, of the ſkirt of him that is a Jew, (in the ſenſe of the Apoſtle) ſaying, <q>We will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.</q> And thus that ſhall be fulfilled, <hi>O thou that heareſt prayer, unto thee ſhall all fleſh come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. We may obſerve the mode of their u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in this duty. It is a viſible union, an union by explicit agreement, a joint reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion declared by one to another, come into by being firſt propoſed by ſome, and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and expreſsly fallen in with by others.— The inhabitants of one city ſhall apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the inhabitants of another, ſaying, <hi>let us go,</hi> &amp;c. Thoſe to whom the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tion is made, ſhall comply with it, the propoſal ſhall take with many, it ſhall be a prevailing, ſpreading thing; one ſhall follow another's example, one and another ſhall ſay, <hi>I will go alſo.</hi> Some ſuppoſe, that thoſe words— <hi>I will go alſo</hi>—are to be taken as the words of him that makes the propoſal; as much as to ſay, I do not propoſe that to you, which I am not willing to do myſelf, I deſire you to go, and I am ready to go with you. But this is to ſuppoſe no more to be expreſſed in theſe latter words, than was expreſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:026594_0078_0FD0B2C5CDB527C0"/>in the propoſal itſelf; for theſe words, <hi>let us go,</hi> ſignify as much, as that I am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to go, and deſire you to go with me. It ſeems to me much more natural, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand theſe latter words as importing the conſent of thoſe to whom the propoſal is made, or the reply of one and another that falls in it. This is much more agreeable to the plain deſign of the text, which is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the concurrence of great numbers in this affair, and more agreeable to the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation made in the next verſe, of one fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing another, many taking hold of the ſkirt of him that is a Jew. And though if the words are thus underſtood, we muſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe an ellipſis in the text, ſomething un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that is not expreſſed, as if it had been ſaid—Thoſe of other cities ſhall ſay— I will go alſo;—yet this is not difficult to be ſuppoſed, ſuch ellipſis are very common in ſcripture. We have one exactly parallel with it in Jer. iii. 22. <hi>Return, ye backſliding children, and I will heal your backſlidings: behold, we come unto thee, for thou art the Lord our God,</hi> i. e. the backſliding children ſhall ſay—"Behold we come unto thee," &amp;c. And in Cant. iv. <hi>Let my beloved come <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="78" facs="unknown:026594_0079_0FD0B2C72D9524C8"/>I am come into my garden, my ſiſter, my ſpouſe,</hi> i. e. her beloved ſhall ſay—"I am come into my garden." We have the like throughout that ſong. So Pſal. l. 6, 7. <hi>The heavens ſhall declare his righteouſneſs, for God is judge himſelf. Hear, O my people, and I will ſpeak,</hi> i. e. the Judge ſhall ſay—"Hear, O my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple," &amp;c. The pſalms and prophets abound with ſuch figures of ſpeech.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We may obſerve the manner of prayer agreed on, or the manner in which they agree, to engage in and perform the duty. Let us go ſpeedily to pray; or as it in the margin, let us go continually. The words literally tranſlated are, <hi>let us go in going.</hi> Such an ingemination or doubling of words, is very common in the Hebrew language, when it is intended that a thing ſhall be very ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſed; it generally implies the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative degree of a thing; as the holy of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies ſignifies the moſt holy; but it common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denotes, not only the utmoſt degree of a thing, but alſo the utmoſt certainty; as when God ſaid to <hi>Abraham, in multiplying, I will multiply thy ſeed.</hi> It implies both that God would certainly multiply his ſeed, and alſo multiply it exceedingly. So when God ſaid to <hi>Adam, in the day that thou eateſt thereof, in
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:026594_0080_0FD0B2C8A7D58A50"/>dying thou ſhalt die</hi> (as the words are in the original) it implies, both that he ſhould ſurely die, and alſo that he ſhould die moſt terribly, ſhould utterly periſh, and be deſtroyed to the utmoſt degree. Yea, ſometimes it ſeems to imply ſomething elſe ſtill; and, in ſhort, as this ingemination of words in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, in general, denotes the ſtrength of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, ſo it is uſed to ſignify almoſt all thoſe things that are wont to be ſignified by the various forms of ſtrong ſpeech in other lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages: ſometimes it ſignifies the utmoſt degree of a thing; ſometimes certainty; ſometimes peremptorineſs and terribleneſs of a threatening, or the greatneſs and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiveneſs of a promiſe, the ſtrictneſs of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and the earneſtneſs of a requeſt.— When God ſays to <hi>Adam, dying thou ſhalt die,</hi> it is equivalent to ſuch ſtrong expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Engliſh, as, thou ſhalt die indeed, or, thou ſhalt die with a witneſs. So when it is ſaid in the text, <hi>let us go in going, and pray before the Lord,</hi> the ſtrength of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion repreſents the earneſtneſs of thoſe that make the propoſal, their great engaged<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the affair; and with reſpect to the duty propoſed, it may be underſtood to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify that they ſhould be ſpeedy, fervent, and
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:026594_0081_0FD0B2CA2826A7F0"/>conſtant in it; or, in one ward, that it ſhould be thoroughly performed.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We may learn from the tenor of this prophecy, together with the context, that this union in ſuch prayer is foretold as a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming and happy thing, and that which would be acceptable to God, and attended with glorious ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>From the whole we may infer, that it is a very ſuitable thing, and well pleaſing to God, for many people, in different parts of the world, by expreſs agreement, to come into a viſible union, in extraordinary, ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy fervent, and conſtant prayer, for thoſe great effuſions of the Holy Spirit, which ſhall bring on that advancement of Chriſt's church and kingdom, that God has ſo often promiſed ſhall be in the latter ages of the world.</p>
                  <p>And ſo from hence I would infer the duty of God's people, with regard to the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial lately ſent over into America, from Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, by a number of miniſters there, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing a method for ſuch an union as has been ſpoken of, in extraordinary prayer for this great mercy.</p>
                  <p>And it being the ſpecial deſign of this diſcourſe, to perſuade ſuch as are friends to
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:026594_0082_0FD0B2CBA675E2E0"/>the intereſts of Chriſt's kingdom, to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the propoſal and requeſt made in that memorial, I ſhall firſt give a ſhort hiſtorical account of the affair it relates to, from letters, papers, and pamphlets, that have come over from Scotland; to which I ſhall annex the memorial itſelf; and then I ſhall offer ſome arguments and motives; tending to induce the friends of religion to fall in with what is propoſed; and laſtly, make anſwer to ſome objections that may poſſibly be made againſt it.</p>
                  <p>As to the firſt of theſe things, viz. an hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical account of the concert, which the memorial relates to, the following obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may give a ſufficient view of that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair.</p>
                  <p>In October. A. D. 1744, a number of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in Scotland, taking into conſideration the ſtate of God's church, and of the world of mankind, judged that the providence of God, at ſuch a day, did loudly call ſuch as were concerned for the welfare of Zion, to united extraordinary applications to the God of all grace, ſuitably acknowledging Him as the fountain of all the ſpiritual be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits and bleſſings of his church, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:026594_0083_0FD0B2CE10BE54C8"/>praying to him, that he would appear in his glory, and favour Zion, and manifeſt his compaſſion to the world of mankind, by an abundant effuſion of his Holy Spirit on all the churches, and the whole habitable earth, to revive true religion in all parts of Chriſtendom, and to deliver all nations from their great and manifold ſpiritual calamities and miſeries, and bleſs them with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable benefits of the kingdom of our glorious Redeemer, and fill the whole earth with his glory. And conſulting one another on the ſubject, they looked on themſelves, for their own part, obliged to engage in this duty; and, as far as in them lay, to perſuade others to the ſame; and to endeavour to find out, and fix on ſome method, that ſhould moſt effectually tend to promote, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold ſuch extraordinary application to heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en among God's people. And after ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God by prayer for direction, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined on the following method, as what they would conform to in their own prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and propoſe to be practiſed by others, for the two years next following, viz.

<pb n="83" facs="unknown:026594_0084_0FD0B2CE18B3B718"/>to every one reſpectively; and more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly, the firſt Tueſday of each quarter, (beginning with the firſt Tueſday of Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, then next enſuing) either the whole day, or part of the day, as perſons find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves diſpoſed, or think their circumſtances will allow; the time to be ſpent either in private praying ſocieties, or in public meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or alone in ſecret, as ſhall be found moſt practicable, or judged moſt conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, by ſuch as are willing, in ſome way or other, to join in this affair; but not that any ſhould make any promiſes, or be looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as under ſtrict bonds in any reſpect, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly and without fail to obſerve every one of theſe days, whatever their circumſtances ſhould be, or however other duties and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary affairs might interfere; or that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhould look upon themſelves bound with regard to theſe days in any wiſe as tho' the time were holy, or the ſetting them a part for religious purpoſes were eſtabliſhed by ſacred authority; but yet, as a proper guard againſt negligence and unſteadineſs, and a prudent preſervative, from yielding to a diſpoſition, which perſons might be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to, through the prevalence of indolence
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:026594_0085_0FD0B2D05DFAE188"/>and liſtleſſneſs, to excuſe themſelves on trivial occaſions, it was propoſed, that thoſe who unite in this affair ſhould reſolve with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that if, by urgent buſineſs, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, they are hindered from joining with others, on the very day agreed on, yet they would not wholly neglect bearing their part in the duty propoſed, but would take the firſt convenient day following, for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon why Saturday evening and Lord's-day morning were judged moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for the weekly ſeaſons, was, that theſe times being ſo near the time of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing goſpel ordinances through the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian world, which are the great means, in the uſe of which God is wont to grant his Spirit to mankind, and the principal means that the Spirit of God makes uſe of to carry on his work of grace, it may be well ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the minds of Chriſtians, in general, will, at theſe ſeaſons, be eſpecially diſengag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from ſecular affairs, and diſpoſed to pious meditations and the duties of devotion, and more naturally led to ſeek communications of the Holy Spirit, and ſucceſs of the means of grace. And as to the quarterly times, it was thought helpful to memory, that they
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:026594_0086_0FD0B2D146DF0498"/>ſhould be on one or other of the firſt days of each quarter; Tueſday was preferred to Monday, becauſe in ſome places people might have public prayers and ſermon on the ſtated day, which might not be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient on Monday, as on ſome day at a greater diſtance from the Sabbath.</p>
                  <p>It was reckoned a chief uſe of ſuch an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement and method as this, that it would be a good expedient for the maintaining and keeping up, amongſt the people of God, that great Chriſtian duty of prayerfulneſs for the coming of Chriſt's kingdom, in general, which Chriſt has directed his followers to be ſo much in, that it may not be out of mind, and in a great meaſure ſunk. Things, that we are too little inclined to, through ſloth, carnali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or a fulneſs of our own worldly and private concerns, and that are to be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at ſome ſeaſons or other, but have no ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ſeaſons ſtated for them, are apt to be forgotten, or put off from time to time, and, as it were, adjourned without day; and ſo, if not wholly neglected, yet too little attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But when we fix certain ſeaſons, which we reſolve, unleſs extraordinarily hindered, to devote to the duty, it tends to prevent
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:026594_0087_0FD0B310AE38EA90"/>forgetfulneſs, and a ſettled negligence of it. The certain returns of the ſeaſon will natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally refreſh the memory, will tend to put us in mind of the precept of Chriſt, and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations that lie on all his followers, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in ſuch a duty, and renewedly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage us to the conſideration of the import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, neceſſity and unſpeakable value of the mercy ſought; and ſo, by frequent renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to keep alive the conſideration, and ſenſe of theſe things at all times. Thus the firſt promoters of this agreement judged that it would be ſubſervient to more abundant prayerfulneſs for effuſions of the Holy Spir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it at all times through the year, both in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and ſocial worſhip; particularly as to this laſt, in congregations, families, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther praying ſocieties. And then they alſo judged, that ſuch an agreed union would tend to animate and encourage God's peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the duty propoſed; and that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſons and ſocieties, knowing that great multitudes of their fellow-Chriſtians, in ſo many diſtant places, were, at the ſame time, (as a token of the union of their hearts with them in this affair) by agreement, engaged in the ſame holy exerciſe, would naturally be enlivened in the duty by ſuch a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="87" facs="unknown:026594_0088_0FD07FD599A29770"/>
It was not thought beſt to propoſe at firſt a longer time for the continuance of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe method than two years; it being conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that it is not poſſible, before any trial, ſo well to judge of the expedience of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular method and certain circumſtances of the managing and ordering ſuch an affair, as after ſome time of experience. And it was not known, but that, after long conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and ſome trial, it might be thought beſt to alter ſome circumſtance; or whether others that had not yet been conſulted, might not propoſe a better method. The time firſt agreed on, though but ſhort, was thought ſufficient to give opportunity for judgment and experience, and for ſuch as were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to union in an affair of ſuch a nature, in diſtant places, mutually to communicate their ſentiments on the ſubject.</p>
                  <p>The way, which thoſe that firſt projected and came into this agreement, thought beſt for the giving notice of it and propoſing it to others, was not by any thing publiſhed from the preſs, but by perſonal converſation with ſuch as they could conveniently have immediate acceſs to, and by private correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence with others at a diſtance. At firſt it was intended, that ſome formal paper pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:026594_0089_0FD07FD704B82910"/>poſing the matter, ſhould be ſent about for proper amendments and improvements, and then concurrence; but on more mature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation, it was conſidered how this might give a handle to objections, (which they tho't it beſt, to the utmoſt, to avoid in the infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the affair) and how practicable it was, without any ſuch formality, to ſpread the ſubſtance of the propoſal by private letters, together with a requeſt to their correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, mutually to communicate their tho'ts. Therefore this was fixed on, as the method that was preferable at the beginning. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, they propoſed and endeavoured to promote the affair in this way, and with ſuch ſucceſs, that great numbers in Scotland and England fell in with the propoſal, and ſome in North America. As to Scotland, it was complied with by numbers, in the four chief towns, Ed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="89" facs="unknown:026594_0090_0FD07FE783B06988"/>praying ſocieties in that city is very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable. Mr. Robe, of Kilſyth, (in a letter to Mr. Prince, of Boſton, dated November 3, 1743.) ſays—There were then above thirty ſocieties of young people there, newly erected, ſome of which conſiſted of upwards of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty members.—As to Glaſgow, this union was unanimouſly agreed to by about forty-five praying ſocieties there, as an eminent miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in that city informs, in a letter.</p>
                  <p>The two years, firſt agreed on, ended laſt November. A little before this time expir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, a number of miniſters in Scotland agreed on a memorial, to be printed and ſent abroad to their brethren in various parts, propoſing to them, and requeſting of them, to join with them in the continuance of this method of united prayer, and in endeavours to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote it. Copies of which memorial have lately been ſent over into New-England, to the number of near five hundred, directed to be diſtributed in almoſt every county in this province of the Maſſachuſetts-Bay, and alſo in ſeveral parts of Connecticut, New-Hampſhire, Rhode-Iſland, New-York, New-Jerſey, Pennſylvania, Maryland, Virginia, Carolina, and Georgia. The moſt, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:026594_0091_0FD0B2D298919CA0"/>of theſe were ſent to one of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational miniſters in Boſton, with a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſubſcribed by twelve miniſters in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, about the affair; many of them to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other of the ſaid miniſters of Boſton, and ſome to a miniſter in Connecticut. It being ſhort, I ſhall here inſert a copy of it at length —It is as follows:</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                     <body>
                        <head>A <hi>MEMORIAL</hi> from ſeveral Miniſters in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, to their Brethren in different places, for continuing a <hi>CONCERT</hi> for <hi>PRAYER,</hi> firſt entered into in the Year <hi>1744.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>WHEREAS it was the chief ſcope of this concert, to promote more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant application to a duty that is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually binding, <hi>prayer that our Lord's king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom may come,</hi> joined with <hi>praiſes;</hi> and it contained ſome circumſtantial expedients, apprehended to be very ſubſervient to that deſign, relating to ſtated times for ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, ſo far as this would not interfere with other duties; particularly a part of Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day evening and Sabbath morning, every week; and more ſolemnly of ſome one of the firſt days of each of the four great divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the year, that is, of each quarter; as the firſt Tueſday, or firſt convenient day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:026594_0092_0FD0B2D3E6897E68"/>
                           <note n="*" place="bottom">The meaning is the firſt Tueſdays of February, May, Auguſt and November, or the firſt convenient days after theſe.</note> and the concert, as to this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, was extended only to two years; it being intended that, before theſe expired, perſons engaged in the concert ſhould reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procally communicate their ſentiments and inclinations, as to the prolonging of the time, with or without alteration, as to the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance mentioned; and it was intended by the firſt promoters, that others at a diſtance ſhould propoſe ſuch circumſtantial amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or improvements, as they ſhould find proper; it is hereby earneſtly intreated, that ſuch would communicate their ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments accordingly, now that the time firſt propoſed is near expiring.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. To induce thoſe already engaged to adhere, and others to accede to this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert, it ſeems of importance to obſerve, that declarations of concurrence, the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating and ſpreading of which are ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently uſeful, are to be underſtood in ſuch a latitude, as to keep at the greateſt diſtance from entangling mens' minds: not as bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men to ſet apart any ſtated days from ſecular affairs, or even to fix on any part of
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:026594_0093_0FD0B2D59A154EA0"/>ſuch and ſuch preciſe days, whether it be convenient or not; nor as abſolute promiſes in any reſpect, but as friendly, harmonious reſolutions, with liberty to alter circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as ſhall be found expedient. On account of all which latitude, and that the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial part extends only to a few years, it is apprehended, the concert cannot be liable to the objections againſt periodical religious times of human appointment.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. It is alſo humbly offered to the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of miniſters, and others furniſhed with gifts for the moſt public inſtructions, whether it might not be of great uſe, by the bleſſing of God, if ſhort and nervous ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture perſuaſives and directions to the duty in view, were compoſed and publiſhed, (either by particular authors, or ſeveral joining to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, which laſt way might ſometimes have peculiar advantages) and that, from time to time, without too great intervals, the better to keep alive on mens' minds a juſt ſenſe of the obligations to a duty ſo important in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and in which many may be in danger to faint and turn remiſs, without ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated incitements; and whether it would not alſo be of great uſe, if miniſters would be pleaſed to preach frequently on the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:026594_0094_0FD0B2D6E88229B8"/>and neceſſity of prayer for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Lord's kingdom, particularly near the quarterly days, or on theſe days them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, where there is public worſhip at that time.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. They who have found it incumbent on them to publiſh this Memorial at this time, having peculiar advantages for ſpreading it, do intreat that the deſire of concurrence and aſſiſtance, contained in it, may, by no means, be underſtood as reſtricted to any particular denomination or party, or to thoſe who are of ſuch or ſuch opinions about any former inſtances of remarkable religious concern; but to be extended to all who ſhall vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe any attention to this paper, and have at heart the intereſt of vital chriſtianity, and the power of godlineſs; and who, however differing about other things, are convinced of the importance of fervent prayer, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote that common intereſt, and of ſcripture perſuaſives to promote ſuch prayer.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. As the firſt printed account of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert was not a propoſal of it, as a thing then to begin, but a narration of it, as a deſign already ſet on ſoot, which had been brought about with much harmony, by means of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate letters, ſo the farther countinuance, and,
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:026594_0095_0FD0B2D866288248"/>it is hoped, the farther ſpreading of it ſeems in a promiſing way of being promoted by the ſame means, as importunate deſires of the renewing the concert have been tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted already from a very diſtant corner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, where the regard to it has of late in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed; but, notwithſtanding of what may be done by private letters, it is humbly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that a memorial ſpread in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner may, by God's bleſſing, farther promote the good ends in view, as it may be uſefully referred to in letters, and may reach where they will not.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Whereas in a valuable letter, from the corner juſt now mentioned, as a place where regard to the concert has lately increaſed, it is propoſed, that it ſhould be continued for ſeven years, or at leaſt for a much longer time than what was ſpecified in the firſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement; thoſe concerned in this memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, who would wiſh rather to receive and ſpread directions and propoſals on this head, than to be the firſt authors of any, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend no inconvenience, for their part, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing to the ſeven years, with the latitude above deſcribed, which reſerves liberty to make ſuch circumſtantial alterations, as may be hereafter found expedient; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:026594_0096_0FD0B2D9E9056B48"/>it ſeems of importance, that the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of ſpreading a concert, which has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready extended to ſo diſtant parts, and may, it is hoped, extend farther, may not need to be renewed ſooner, at leaſt much ſooner, as it is uncertain but that may endanger the dropping of it, and it ſeems probable, there will be leſs zeal in ſpreading of it, if the time propoſed for its continuance be too incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable. Mean time, declarations of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence for a leſs number of years may greatly promote the good ends in view, tho' it ſeems very expedient, that it ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed what was firſt agreed on, ſeeing it is found on trial, that that time, inſtead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too long, was much too ſhort.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. If perſons who formerly agreed to this concert, ſhould now diſcontinue it, would it not look too like that fainting in prayer, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which we are ſo expreſsly warned in ſcripture? And would not this be the more unſuitable at this time, in any within the Britiſh dominions, when they have the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited calls of ſuch public chaſtiſements and deliverances, to more concern than ever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout public reformation, and conſequently about that which is the ſource of all tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough reformation, the regenerating and

                  <p n="1">1. It is evident, from the ſcripture, that there is yet remaining a great advancement of the intereſt of religion, and the kingdom of Chriſt, in this world, by an abundant out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouring of the Spirit of God, far greater and more extenſive than ever yet has been. It is certain, that many things, which are ſpoken concerning a glorious time of the church's enlargement and proſperity, in the latter days, have never yet been fulfilled. There has never yet been any propagation and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing of religion, in any wiſe, of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and univerſality, which the prophecies
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:026594_0099_0FD0B2DE724A63C0"/>repreſent. It is often foretold and ſignified, in a great variety of ſtrong expreſſions, that there ſhould a time come, when all nations, through the whole habitable world, ſhould embrace the true religion, and be brought into the church of God. It was often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to the patriarchs, that <hi>in their ſeed all the nations,</hi> or, (as it is ſometimes expreſſed) <hi>all the families of the earth ſhould be bleſſed.</hi> Agreeably to this, it is ſaid of the Meſſiah, That <hi>all nations ſhall ſerve him,</hi> and <hi>men ſhall be bleſſed in him, and all nations ſhall call him bleſſed.</hi> And it is ſaid, that <hi>all nations ſhall flow unto the mountain of the houſe of the Lord.</hi> And, that <hi>all nations ſhall be gathered unto the name of the Lord to Jeruſalem, and ſhall walk no more after the imagination of their evil heart.</hi> So it is ſaid, that <hi>all fleſh ſhall come and worſhip before the Lord.</hi> And that <hi>all fleſh ſhould ſee the glory of God together.</hi> And that <hi>all fleſh ſhould come to him that hears prayer.</hi> Chriſt compares the kingdom of heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, in this world, to leaven, <hi>which a woman took and hid in three meaſures of meal, till the whole was leavened.</hi> It is natural and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſuppoſe, that the whole world ſhould finally be given to Chriſt, as one whoſe right it is to reign, as the proper heir of him who
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:026594_0100_0FD0B2DFE73B59A8"/>is originally the king of all nations, and the poſſeſſor of heaven and earth; and the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teaches us, that God the Father had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted his Son, as God-Man, and in his kingdom of grace, or mediatorial kingdom, to be the <hi>heir of the world,</hi> that he might in this kingdom have <hi>the heathen for his inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and the utmoſt ends of the earth for his poſſeſſion.</hi> Thus Abraham is ſaid to be <hi>the heir of the world,</hi> not in himſelf, but in <hi>his ſeed,</hi> which is Chriſt. And how was this to be fulfilled to Abraham, but by God's fulfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that great promiſe. that <hi>in his ſeed all the nations of the ear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap> ſhould be bleſſed?</hi> For that promiſe is what the apoſtle is ſpeaking of; which ſhews, that God has appointed Chriſt to be the heir of the world in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of grace, and to poſſeſs and reign over all nations, through the propagation of his goſpel, and the power of his Spirit commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating the bleſſings of it. God had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him to this univerſal dominion by a moſt ſolemn oath: <hi>I have ſworn by myſelf, the word is gone out of my mouth in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and ſhall not return, that unto me e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very knee ſhall bow, every tongue ſhall ſwear.</hi> Though this ſolemn oath of God the Father is to be underſtood in ſo comprehenſive a
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:026594_0101_0FD0B2E173C82250"/>ſenſe, as to extend to what ſhall be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed at the day of judgment, yet it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by the foregoing and following verſes, that the thing moſt directly intended, is what ſhall be fulfilled by the ſpreading of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of his ſalvation, and power of the Spirit of grace, bringing <hi>all the ends of the earth to look to him that they may be ſaved,</hi> and come to him for <hi>righteouſneſs and ſtrength</hi> that, <hi>in him they might be juſtified, and might glory.</hi> God has ſuffered many earthly princes to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their conqueſts over a great part of the face of the earth, and to poſſeſs a dominion of a vaſt extent, and one monarchy to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer and ſucceed another, the latter being ſtill the greater; it is reaſonable to ſuppoſe that a much greater glory in this reſpect ſhould be reſerved for Chriſt, God's own ſon and rightful heir, who has purchaſed the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion by ſo great and hard a ſervice; it is reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that his dominion ſhould be far the largeſt, and his conqueſts vaſtly the greateſt and moſt extenſive. And thus the ſcriptures repreſent the matter, in Nebuchadnezzar's viſion, and the prophet's interpretation, Dan. ii. There the four great monarchies of the earth, one ſucceeding an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, are repreſented by <hi>the great image of
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:026594_0102_0FD0B2E2E7679DB0"/>gold, ſilver, braſs, iron and clay;</hi> but at laſt <hi>a ſtone, cut out of the mountains without hands, ſmites the image upon his feet, which breaks the iron, clay, braſs, ſilver and gold in pieces, that all becomes as the chaff of the ſummer threſhing floors, and the wind carries them away, that no place is found for them; but the ſtone waxes great, becomes a great mountain, and</hi> FILLS THE WHOLE EARTH; ſignifying the kingdom which the Lord God of heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en ſhould ſet up in the world, laſt of all, which ſhould break in pieces and conſume all other kingdoms. Surely this repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation leads us to ſuppoſe, that this laſt king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſhall be of vaſtly greater extent than any of the preceding. The like repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is made in the viith chapter of Daniel; there the four monarchies are repreſented by four great beaſts that aroſe ſucceſſively, one conquering and ſubduing another; the fourth and laſt of theſe is ſaid to be <hi>dreadful</hi> and <hi>terrible,</hi> and <hi>ſtrong exceedingly,</hi> and <hi>to have great iron teeth,</hi> and <hi>to devour and break in pieces, and ſtamp the reſidue with his feet;</hi> yea, it is ſaid, verſe 23, that the kingdom repreſented by this beaſt ſhall <hi>devour the whole earth;</hi> but laſt of all, <hi>one like the Son of Man</hi> appears, <hi>coming to the Ancient of
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:026594_0103_0FD0B2E4760A8C88"/>Days, and being brought near before him, and receiving of him a dominion, and glory, and a kingdom,</hi> THAT ALL PEOPLE, NATIONS AND LANGUAGES <hi>ſhould ſerve him.</hi> This laſt circumſtance, of the vaſt extent and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality of his dominion, is manifeſtly ſpoken of as one thing greatly diſtinguiſhing this holy kingdom from all the preceding mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies; although of one of the former it was ſaid, that it ſhould <hi>devour the whole earth,</hi> yet we are naturally led, both by the much greater emphaſis and ſtrength of the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as well as by the whole connexion and tenor of the prophecy, to underſtand the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſality here expreſſed in a much more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive and abſolute ſenſe; and terms uſed in the interpretation of this viſion are ſuch, that ſcarcely any can be deviſed more ſtrong, to ſignify an abſolute univerſality of dominion over the inhabitants of the face of the earth; ver. 27. <hi>And the kingdom, and dominion, and</hi> GREATNESS OF THE KINGDOMUNDER THE WHOLE HEAVEN, <hi>ſhall be given to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the moſt high God.</hi> Agreeably to this, the goſpel is repreſented as <hi>preached unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>It would be unreaſonable to ſay, theſe are only bold figures, uſed after the manner of the eaſtern nations, to expreſs the great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Chriſtian church, at and after the days of Conſtantine; to ſay ſo, would be in effect to ſay, that it would have been impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for God, if he had deſired it, plainly to have foretold any thing that ſhould abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely have extended to all nations of the earth.

<pb n="107" facs="unknown:026594_0108_0FD0B2EB4F3C1DB0"/>teaches us to look on that great out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouring of the Spirit and in-gathering of ſouls into Chriſt's kingdom, that was in thoſe days, firſt of the Jews, and then of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, to be but as the firſt-fruits of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended harveſt, both with regard to Jews and Gentiles; and to look on the in-gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe firſt fruits as a ſign that all the remainder both of Jews and Gentiles ſhall in due time be gathered in. <hi>For if the firſt-fruit be holy, the lump is alſo holy: and if the root be holy, ſo are the branches.</hi> And in that context, the apoſtle ſpeaks of the FULNESS of both Jews and Gentiles, as what ſhall hereafter be brought in, as diſtinct from that in-gathering from among both, which was in thoſe primitive ages of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity; we read of the fulneſs of the Jews, and of the fulneſs of the Gentiles; and the apoſtle teaches us to look upon that infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and darkneſs, which firſt prevailed over all Gentile nations, before Chriſt came, and then over the Jews after Chriſt came, as what was wiſely permitted of God, as a prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the manifeſtation of the glory of God's mercy, in due time, on the whole world, conſtituted of Jews and Gentiles. God hath concluded them all in unbelief,
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:026594_0109_0FD0B2ECD29F8C30"/>that he might have mercy upon all. Theſe things plainly ſhew, that the time is coming when the whole world of mankind ſhall be brought into the church of Chriſt; and not only a part of the Jews, and a part of the Gentile world, as the firſt-fruits, as it was in the firſt ages of the Chriſtian church; but the fulneſs of both, the whole lump, all the nation of the Jews, and all the world of Gentiles.</p>
                  <p>In the laſt great conflict between the church of Chriſt and her enemies, before the commencement of the glorious time of the church's peace and reſt, the kings of the earth, and the <hi>whole world,</hi> are repreſented as gathered together, and then the ſeventh angel pours out his vial into the air, which limits that kingdom that Satan has, as god of this world, in its utmoſt extent;—and that kingdom is repreſented as utterly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown. In another deſcription of that great battle, Chriſt is repreſented as riding forth, having on his head many crowns, and on his veſture and on his thigh a name writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS. Which we may well ſuppoſe ſignifies, that he is now going to that conqueſt, whereby he ſhall ſet up a kingdom, in which he ſhall be
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:026594_0110_0FD0B2EE28E0A920"/>king of kings, in a far more extenſive man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than either the Babyloniſh, Perſian, Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, or Roman monarchs were. And an angel appears ſtanding in the ſun, that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looks the whole world, calling on all the fowls that fly in the midſt of heaven, to come and eat the fleſh of kings, &amp;c. And in conſequence of the great victory Chriſt gains at that time, <hi>an angel comes down from heaven, having the key of the bottomleſs pit, and a great ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now will any be ſo unreaſonable as to ſay, that all theſe things do not ſignify more than that one third part of the world ſhould be brought into the church of Chriſt, beyond
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:026594_0111_0FD0B2EFB5097038"/>which it cannot be pretended that the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian religion has ever yet reached, in its great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt extent? Thoſe countries, which belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Roman empire, that were brought to the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, after the reign of Conſtantine, are but a ſmall part of what the habitable world now is; as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of ground, they altogether bear, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, no greater proportion to it, than the land of Canaan did to the Roman empire. —And our Redeemer, in his kingdom of grace, has hitherto poſſeſſed but a little part of the world, in its moſt flouriſhing ſtate, ſince arts are ariſen to their greateſt height, and a very great part of the world is but lately diſcovered, and much remains undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to this day.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things make it very evident, that the main fulfilment of thoſe prophecies that ſpeak of the glorious advancement of Chriſt's kingdom on earth, is ſtill to come.</p>
                  <p>And as there has been nothing as yet, with regard to the flouriſhing of religion, and the advancement of Chriſt's kingdom, of ſuch extent as to anſwer the prophecies, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther has there been any thing of that dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is foretold.

                  <p>But the church of Chriſt has never yet enjoyed a ſtate of peace and proſperity for any long time; on the contrary, the times of her reſt, and of the flouriſhing ſtate of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, have ever been very ſhort. Hitherto the church may ſay, <hi>Return, for thy ſervants ſake, the tribes of thine inheritance; the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of thy holineſs have poſſeſſed it but a little while.</hi> The quietneſs that the church of God enjoyed after the beginning of Conſtantine's reign was very ſhort; the peace the empire enjoyed, in freedom from war, was not more

                  <p>And another thing that makes it exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manifeſt, that that day of the church's greateſt advancement on earth, which is fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told in ſcripture, has never yet come, is that, it is ſo plainly and expreſsly revealed that this day ſhould ſucceed the laſt of the four monarchies, even the Roman, in its laſt ſtate, wherein it is divided into ten kingdoms, and after the deſtruction of Antichriſt, ſignified by the little horn, whoſe reign is contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary with the reign of the ten kings. Theſe
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:026594_0115_0FD0B2F5B9BB01C8"/>things are very plain in the ſecond and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth chapters of Daniel, and alſo in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of St. John. And it is alſo plain by the ninth chapter of Romans, that it ſhall be after the national converſion of the Jews, which ſhall be as life from the dead to the Gentiles, and the fulneſs of both Jews and Gentiles ſhould be come in, and all the nation of the Jews, and all other nations, ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain mercy, and there ſhall be that general in-gathering of the harveſt of the whole earth, of which all that had been converted before, either of Jews or Gentiles, were but the firſt fruits. And many other evidences of this point might be mentioned, which for brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's ſake I omit.</p>
                  <p>And thus it is meet, that the laſt kingdom which ſhall take place on earth, ſhould be the kingdom of God's own Son and heir, whoſe right it is to rule and reign; and that whatever revolutions and confuſions there may be in the world, for a long time, the cauſe of truth, the righteous cauſe, ſhould finally prevail, and God's holy people ſhould at laſt inherit the earth, and reign on earth; and that the world ſhould continue in tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, and great revolutions, following one another, from age to age, the world being,
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:026594_0116_0FD0B2F730C62908"/>as it were, in travail, till truth and holineſs are brought forth; that all things ſhould be ſhaken, till that comes which is true and right, and agreeable to the mind of God, which cannot be ſhaken; and that the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the ruler of the world ſhould be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in the bringing all things ultimately to ſo good an iſſue. The world is made for the Son of God; his kingdom is the end of all changes that come to paſs in the ſtate of the world of mankind; all are only to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the way for this; it is fit therefore that the laſt kingdom on earth ſhould be his.— It is wiſely and mercifully ordered of God that it ſhould be ſo, on this account, as well as many others, viz. that the church of God, under all preceding changes, ſhould have this conſideration to encourage her, and maintain her hope, and animate her faith and prayers, from generation to generation, that God has promiſed, her cauſe ſhould finally be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and prevail in this world.</p>

                  <p>The ſum of the bleſſings Chriſt ſought, by what he did and ſuffered in the work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, was the Holy Spirit. So is the affair of our redemption conſtituted; the Father provides and gives the Redeemer, and the price of redemption is offered to him, and he grants the benefit purchaſed; the Son is the redeemer who gives the price, and alſo is the price offered; and the Holy Spirit is the grand bleſſing obtained by the
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:026594_0124_0FD0B304A6FC06B8"/>price offered, and beſtowed on the redeemed. The Holy Spirit, in his in-dwelling, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences and fruits, is the ſum of all grace, holineſs, comfort and joy; or in one word, of all the ſpiritual good Chriſt purchaſed for men in this world; and is alſo the ſum of all perfection, glory and eternal joy, that he purchaſed for them in another world. The Holy Spirit is that great benefit, which is the ſubject-matter of the promiſes, both of the eternal covenant of redemption, and alſo of the covenant of grace; the grand ſubject of the promiſes of the Old Teſtament, in the prophecies of the bleſſings of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah's kingdom; and the chief ſubject of the promiſes of the New Teſtament; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of the covenant of grace delivered by Jeſus Chriſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Therefore the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit is ſo often called the ſpirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and emphatically, the promiſe, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the Father, &amp;c. This being the great bleſſing Chriſt purchaſed by his labours and ſufferings on earth, it was the bleſſing he received of the Father, when he aſcended
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:026594_0125_0FD0B3063052AAA0"/>into heaven, and entered into the holy of holies with his own blood, to communicate to thoſe that he had redeemed. <hi>It is expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for you, that I go away; for if I go not away, the comforter will not come; but if I depart, I will ſend him unto you.

<pb n="125" facs="unknown:026594_0126_0FD0B307A9EE7770"/>his diſciples, and all his future church, the evening before he died. The bleſſing he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for to the Father, in behalf of his diſciples, was the ſame he had inſiſted on in his preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcourſe with them; and this, doubtleſs, was the bleſſing he prayed for when, as our High Prieſt, he offered up ſtrong crying and tears, with his blood. The ſame that he ſhed his blood for, he alſo ſhed tears for, and pour<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed out prayers for.</p>
                  <p>But the time that we have been ſpeaking of, is the chief time of the beſtowment of this bleſſing—the main ſeaſon of the ſucceſs of all that Chriſt did and ſuffered in the work of our redemption. Before this the Spirit of God is given but very ſparingly, and but few are ſaved; but then it will be far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; wickedneſs ſhall be rare then, as vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and piety had been before; and, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, by far the greateſt number of them that ever receive the benefits of Chriſt's redemption, from the beginning of the world to the end of it, will receive it in that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And there is reaſon to think, that through the greater part of this period, at leaſt, the number of ſaints will, in their increaſe, bear a proportion to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the number of inhabitants. And it muſt be conſidered, that if the number of mankind at the beginning of this period be no more than equal to the preſent number, yet we may doubtleſs conclude, that the number of true ſaints will be immenſely greater, when inſtead of the few true and thorough Chriſtians now in ſome few coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, every nation on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

I think, the foregoing things conſidered, we ſhall be very mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in our conjectures, if we ſay, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that there will be an hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times more, that will actually be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed to God by Chriſt's blood, during that period of the church's proſperity that we have been ſpeaking of, than ever had been before, from the beginning of the world to that time.</p>
                  <p>That time is repreſented in ſcripture, as the proper appointed ſeaſon of Chriſt's ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; eminently the elect ſeaſon, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted time and day of ſalvation, the year of Chriſt's redeemed.

                  <p n="4">4. The whole creation is, as it were, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly waiting for that day, and conſtantly groaning and travailing in pain to bring forth the felicity and glory of it. For that day is above all other times, excepting the day of judgment, the day of the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſons of God, and of their glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous liberty; and, therefore, that elegant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation the apoſtle makes of the earneſt expectation and travail of the creation, in Rom. viii. 19—22 is applicable to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious event of this day. <hi>The earneſt expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the creature waiteth for the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of the ſons of God. For the creature was made ſubject to vanity, not willingly, but by reaſon of him who hath ſubjected the ſame in hope. Becauſe the creature itſelf alſo ſhall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.</hi>— The viſible world has now, for many ages,
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:026594_0132_0FD0B30F26F03B30"/>been ſubjected to ſin, and made, as it were, a ſervant to it, through the abuſive improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that man, who has the dominion over the creatures, puts the creatures to. Thus the ſun is a ſort of ſervant to all manner of wickedneſs, as its light, and other beneficial influences are abuſed by men, and made ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to their luſts and ſinful purpoſes. So of the rain, and fruits of the earth, and the brute animals, and all other parts of the viſible creation; they all ſerve mens' cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and obey their ſinful will; and God doth, in a ſort, ſubject them to it, for he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues his influence and power to make them to be obedient, according to the ſame law of nature, whereby they yield to mens' com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand when uſed to good purpoſes. It is by the immediate influence of God upon things, acting upon them, according to thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant methods which we call the laws of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that they are ever obedient to mens' will, or that we can uſe them at all. This influence God continues to make them obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to mens' will though wicked; which is a ſure ſign that the preſent ſtate of things is not laſting, it is confuſion, and God would not ſuffer it to be, but that he deſigns, in a little time, to put an end to it, when it ſhall
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:026594_0133_0FD07FD282FF1700"/>no more be ſo. Seeing it is to be but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while, God chuſes rather to ſubject the creature to man's wickedneſs, than to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb and interrupt the courſe of nature ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its ſtated laws; but it is, as it were, a force upon the creature; for the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is abuſed in it, perverted to far meaner purpoſes than thoſe for which the author of its nature made it, and to which he adapted it. The creature, therefore, is, as it were, unwillingly ſubject, and would not be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but that it is but for a ſhort time, and it, as it were, hopes for an alteration. It is a bondage the creature is ſubject to, from which it was partly delivered when Chriſt came, and the goſpel was promulgated in the world, and will be more fully delivered at the commencement of the glorious day we are ſpeaking of, and perfectly at the day of judgment. This agrees with the context, for the apoſtle was ſpeaking of the preſent fuffering ſtate of the church. The reaſon why the church in this world is in a ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtate, is, that the world is ſubjected to the ſin and corruption of mankind. By va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, in ſcripture, is very commonly meant ſin and wickedneſs, and alſo by corruption, as might be ſhewn in many places would my intended brevity allow.</p>

Though the creature is thus ſubject to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, yet it does not reſt in this ſubjection, but is conſtantly acting and exerting itſelf, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to that glorious liberty that God has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed at the time we are ſpeaking of, and, as it were, reaching forth towards it. All the changes that are brought to paſs in the world, from age to age, are ordered by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite wiſdom, in one reſpect or other, to prepare the way for that glorious iſſue of things, that ſhall be when truth and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="134" facs="unknown:026594_0135_0FD0B313DE4321A0"/>the kingdoms and empires of the world, from one age to another, are, as it were, travail-pangs of the creation, in order to bring forth this glorious event. And the ſcriptures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the laſt ſtruggles and changes that ſhall immediately precede this event, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the greateſt of all—as the laſt pangs of a woman in travail are the moſt violent.</p>
                  <p>The creature thus earneſtly expecting this glorious manifeſtation and liberty of the children of God, and travailing in pain in order to it, therefore the ſcriptures, by a like figure, do very often repreſent, that when this ſhall be accompliſhed, the whole inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate creation ſhall greatly rejoice: That <hi>the heavens ſhall ſing, the earth be glad, the mountains break forth into ſinging, the hills be joyful together, the trees clap their hands, the lower parts of the earth ſhout, the ſea roar and the fulneſs thereof, and the floods clap their hands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All the intelligent elect creation, all God's holy creatures in heaven and earth, are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and properly waiting for, and earneſtly expecting that event. It is abundantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in ſcripture as the ſpirit and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of all true ſaints, that they ſet their hearts upon, love, long, wait and pray for
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:026594_0136_0FD0B31527DBFEA8"/>the promiſed glory of that day; they are ſpoken of as thoſe that <hi>prefer Jeruſalem to their chief joy; that take pleaſure in the ſtones of Zion, and favour the duſt thereof; that wait for the conſolation of Iſrael.</hi> It is the language of the church of God, and the breathing of the ſoul of every true ſaint, that we have in Pſal. xiv. 7. <hi>O that the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Iſrael were come out of Zion! when the Lord bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob ſhall rejoice, and Iſrael ſhall be glad.</hi> Agreeably to this was the ſpirit of old Jacob, which he expreſſed when he was dying, in faith in the great promiſe made to him and Iſaac and Abraham, that <hi>in their ſeed all the families of the earth ſhould be bleſſed. I have waited for thy ſalvation, O Lord.</hi> The ſame is repreſented as the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of his true children, or the family of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob. <hi>I will wait upon the Lord, that hideth himſelf from the houſe of Jacob, and I will look for him.—They that love Chriſt's appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> is a name that the apoſtle gives to true chriſtians.</p>

                  <p n="5">5. The word of God is full of precepts, encouragements and examples, tending to excite and induce the people of God to be much in prayer for this mercy.</p>
                  <p>The ſpirit of God is the chief of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings that are the ſubject-matter of chriſtian prayer; for it is the ſum of all ſpiritual bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings; which are thoſe that we need infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more than others; and are thoſe wherein our true and eternal happineſs conſiſts.— That which is the ſum of the bleſſings that Chriſt purchaſed, is the ſum of the bleſſings that Chriſtians have to pray for; but that, as was obſerved before, is the Holy Spirit; and therefore when the diſciples came to Chriſt, and deſired him to teach them to pray, Luke xi. he accordingly gave them particular directions for the performance of this duty;—the concluſion of his whole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, in the 13th verſe, plainly ſhews that the Holy Spirit is the ſum of the bleſſings
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:026594_0138_0FD0B3186A1694F8"/>that are the ſubject-matter of that prayer about which he had inſtructed them. <hi>If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more ſhall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that aſk him?</hi> From which words of Chriſt we may alſo obſerve, that there is no bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that we have ſo great encouragement to pray for, as the Spirit of God; the words imply, that our heavenly Father is eſpecially ready to beſtow his Holy Spirit on them that aſk him. Of the more excellent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture any benefit is, which we ſtand in need of, the more ready God is to beſtow it in anſwer to prayer. The infinite goodneſs of God's nature is the more gratified, and the grand deſign and aim of the contrivance and work of our redemption, is the more anſwered, and Jeſus Chriſt the Redeemer has the greater ſucceſs in his undertaking and labours; and thoſe deſires that are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in prayer for the moſt excellent bleſſings are the moſt excellent deſires, and conſequently ſuch as God moſt approves of, and is moſt ready to gratify.</p>
                  <p>The ſcriptures do not only direct and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage us in general to pray for the Holy Spirit above all things elſe, but it is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:026594_0139_0FD0B319B4C36E58"/>preſsly revealed will of God, that his church ſhould be very much in prayer for that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious out-pouring of the Spirit that is to be in the latter days, and the things that ſhall be accompliſhed by it. God ſpeaking of that bleſſed event, Ezek. xxxvi. under the figure of <hi>cleanſing the houſe of Iſrael from all their iniquities, planting and building their waſte and ruined places, and making them to become like the garden of Eden, and filling them with men like a flock, like the holy flock, the flock of Jeruſalem in her ſolemn feaſts;</hi> wherein he, doubtleſs, has reſpect to the ſame glorious reſtoration and advancement of his church that is ſpoken of in the next chapter, and in all the following chapters to the end of the book, he ſays, ver. 37. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, I will yet for this be enquired of by the houſe of Iſrael, to do it for them.</hi> Which, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, implies, that it is the will of God that extraordinary prayerfulneſs in his people for this mercy ſhould precede the beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it.</p>
                  <p>I know of no place in the Bible, where ſo ſtrong an expreſſion is made uſe of to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy importunity in prayer, as is uſed in Iſai. lxii. 6, 7. where the people of God are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon to be importunate for this mercy:
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:026594_0140_0FD0B31B9DFD3730"/>
                     <hi>Ye that make mention of the Lord, keep not ſilence, and give him no reſt, till he eſtabliſh, and till he make Jeruſalem a praiſe in the earth.</hi> How ſtrong is the phraſe? And how loud is this call to the church of God, to be fervent and inceſſant in their cries to him for this great mercy? How wonderful are the words to be uſed, concerning the manner in which ſuch worms of the duſt ſhould addreſs the high and lofty One that inhabits eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? And what encouragement is here, to approach the mercy-ſeat with the greateſt freedom, boldneſs, earneſtneſs, conſtancy, and full aſſurance of faith, to ſeek of God this greateſt thing that can be ſought in chriſtian prayer?</p>
                  <p>It is a juſt obſervation of a certain emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent miniſter of the church of Scotland, in a diſcourſe of his, on ſocial prayer, in which, ſpeaking of pleading for the ſucceſs of the goſpel, as required by the Lord's prayer, he ſays, <q>That notwithſtanding of its being ſo compendious, yet the one half of it, that is, three petitions in ſix, and theſe the firſt preſcribed, do all relate to this great caſe; ſo that to put up any one of theſe petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons apart, or all of them together, is upon the matter, to pray that the diſpenſation
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:026594_0141_0FD0B31D0850D090"/>of the goſpel may be bleſſed with divine power.</q> That glorious day we are ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of is the proper and appointed time, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all others, for the bringing to paſs the things requeſted in each of theſe petitions; as the prophecies every where repreſent that as the time, which God has eſpecially ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the hallowing or glorifying his own great name in this world, cauſing <hi>his glory to be revealed, that all fleſh may ſee it together,</hi> cauſing it <hi>openly to be manifeſted in the ſight of the heathen,</hi> filling the whole world with the light of his glory to ſuch a degree, that <hi>the moon ſhall be confounded and the ſun aſhamed</hi> before that brighter glory; the appointed time for the glorifying and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying the name of Jeſus Chriſt, cauſing <hi>every knee to bow, and every tongue to confeſs to him.</hi> This is the proper time <hi>of God's kingdom's coming,</hi> or of <hi>Chriſt's coming in his kingdom:</hi> that is the very time foretold in the iid of Daniel, when the <hi>Lord God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſhall ſet up a kingdom,</hi> in the latter times of the laſt monarchy, when it is divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ten kingdoms; and that is the very time foretold in the viith of Daniel, when there ſhould be <hi>given to One like to the Son of Man, dominion, glory, and a kingdom, that all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:026594_0142_0FD0B31E2876FE58"/>nations, and languages, ſhould ſerve him; and the kingdom and dominion, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the kingdom under the whole heaven ſhall be given to the people of the ſaints of the moſt high God,</hi> after the deſtruction of the <hi>little horn,</hi> that ſhould continue <hi>for a time, times, and the dividing of time.</hi> And that is the time wherein <hi>God's will ſhall be done on earth, as it is done in heaven;</hi> when heaven ſhall, as it were, be bowed, and come down to the earth, as <hi>God's people ſhall be all righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and holineſs to the Lord ſhall be written on the bells of the horſes,</hi> &amp;c. So that the three firſt petitions of the Lord's prayer are, in effect, no other than requeſts for the bringing on this glorious day.—And as the Lord's prayer begins with aſking for this, in the three firſt petitions, ſo it concludes with it, in theſe words, <hi>For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory for ever. Amen.</hi> Which words imply a requeſt, that God would take to himſelf his great power, and reign, and manifeſt his power and glory in the world. Thus Chriſt teaches us, that it becomes his diſciples to ſeek this above all other things, and make it the firſt and the laſt in their prayers, and that every petition ſhould be put up in a ſubordination to the
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:026594_0143_0FD0B31FA7A2DDA8"/>advancement of God's kingdom and glory in the world.</p>
                  <p>Beſides what has been obſerved of the Lord's prayer, if we look through the whole Bible, and obſerve all the examples of prayer that we find there recorded, we ſhall not find ſo many prayers for any other mercy, as for the deliverance, reſtoration, and proſperity of the church, and the advancement of God's glory and kingdom of grace in the world. If we well conſider the prayers that we find recorded in the book of Pſalms, I believe we ſhall ſee reaſon to think, that a very great, if not the greater part of them, are prayers uttered, either in the name of Chriſt, or in the name of the church, for ſuch a mercy; and undoubtedly, the greateſt part of that book of Pſalms, is made up of prayers for this mercy, prophecies of it, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical praiſes for it.</p>
                  <p>The prophets, in their prophecies of the reſtoration and advancement of the church, very often ſpeak of it as what ſhall be done in anſwer to the prayers of God's people. Iſai: xxv. 9.—xxvi. 9, 12, 13, 16, 17. to the end. Chap. xxxiii. 2. Pſal. cii. 13—22. Jer. iii. 21. Iſai. lxv. 24.—xli. 17. Hoſ. v. 15. with vi. 1, 2, 3. and xiv. 2. to the
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:026594_0144_0FD0B32126023598"/>end.—Zech. x. 6.—xii. x. and xiii. 9. Iſai. lv. 6. with ver. 12, 13. Jer. xxxiii. 3. The prophecies of future glorious times of the church, are often introduced with a prayer of the church for her deliverance and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement, prophetically uttered, as in Iſai. li. 9, &amp;c. Chap. lxiii. 11. to the end, and lxiv. throughout.</p>
                  <p>In order to Chriſt's being myſtically born into the world, in the advancement and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing of true religion, and great increaſe of the number of true converts who are ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of as having Chriſt formed in them, the ſcriptures repreſent it as requiſite, that the church ſhould firſt be in travail, crying, and pained to be delivered. And one thing that we have good reaſon to underſtand by it, is her exerciſing ſtrong deſires, and wreſtling and agonizing with God in prayer for this event; becauſe we find ſuch figures of ſpeech uſed in this ſenſe elſewhere. <hi>My little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, of whom I travail in birth again, until Chriſt be formed in you. Lord, in trouble have they viſited thee; they poured out a prayer when thy chaſtening was upon them. Like as a woman with child, that draweth near the time of her delivery, is in pain, and cryeth out in her pangs, ſo have we been in thy ſight, O
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:026594_0145_0FD0B322A727CDC0"/>Lord.</hi> And certainly it is fit, that the church of God ſhould be in travail for that, which (as I before obſerved) the whole creation tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails in pain for.</p>
                  <p>The ſcriptures do not only abundantly manifeſt it to be the duty of God's peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be much in prayer for this great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but they alſo abound with manifold conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations to encourage them in it, and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate them with hopes of ſucceſs. There is, perhaps, no one thing that ſo much of the Bible is taken up in the promiſes of, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to encourage the faith, hope, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the ſaints as this, which at once af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords to God's people the cleareſt evidences that it is their duty to be much in prayer for this mercy, (for, undoubtedly, that which God does abundantly make the ſubject of his promiſes, God's people ſhould abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make the ſubject of their prayers) and alſo affords them the ſtrongeſt aſſurances that their prayers ſhall be ſucceſsful. With what conſidence may we go before God, and pray for that, of which we have ſo many exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing precious and glorious promiſes to plead? The very firſt promiſe of God to fallen man, even that <hi>it ſhall bruiſe thy head,</hi> is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe which is to have its chief fulfilment at
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:026594_0146_0FD0B32426E755D8"/>that day; and the whole Bible concludes with a promiſe of the glory of that day, and a prayer for its fulfilment. <hi>He that teſtifieth theſe things, ſaith—Surely, I come quickly— Amen. Even ſo, come, Lord Jeſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſcripture gives us great reaſon to think, that when once there comes to appear much of a ſpirit of prayer in the church of God for this mercy, then it will ſoon be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed. It is evidently with reference to this mercy, that God makes that promiſe, <hi>When the poor and needy ſeek water, and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirſt, I, the Lord, will hear them; I, the God of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, will not forſake them; I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midſt of the vallies; I will make the wilderneſs a pool of water, and the dry land ſprings of water; I will plant in the wilderneſs the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>dar, the ſhittah-tree, and the myrtle, and the oil-tree; I will ſet in the deſart the fir-tree, the pine, and the box-tree together.</hi> Spiritual waters and rivers are explained by the apoſtle John, to be the Holy Spirit. It is now a time of ſcarcity of theſe ſpiritual waters; there are, as it were, none: If God's people, in this time of great drought, were but made duly
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:026594_0147_0FD0B325B480F2D0"/>ſenſible of this calamity, and their own emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs and neceſſity, and brought earneſtly to thirſt and cry for needed ſupplies, God would, doubtleſs, ſoon fulfil this bleſſed promiſe.— We have another promiſe much like this, in Pſal. cii. 16, 17. <hi>When the Lord ſhall build up Zion, he ſhall appear in his glory; he will regard the prayer of the deſtitute, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe their prayer.</hi> And remarkable are the words that follow in the next verſe: <hi>This ſhall be written for the generation to come; and the people which ſhall be created ſhall praiſe the Lord.</hi> Which ſeems to ſignify, that this promiſe ſhall be left on record to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage ſome future generation of God's people to pray and cry earneſtly for this mercy, to whom he would fulfil the promiſe, and thereby give them, and great multitudes of others, that ſhould be converted through their prayers, occaſion to praiſe his name. Who knows but that the generation here ſpoken of, may be this preſent generation? One thing mentioned in the character of that future generation, is certainly true concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the preſent, viz. That it is deſtitute; the church of God is in very low, ſorrowful and needy circumſtances; and if the next thing, there ſuppoſed, were alſo verified in us, viz.
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:026594_0148_0FD0B327272652D8"/>That we were made ſenſible of our great ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity, and brought to cry earneſtly to God for help, I am perſuaded that the third would be alſo verified, viz. That our prayers would be turned into joyful praiſes, for God's gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious anſwers of our prayers. It is ſpoken of as a ſign and evidence, that the time to favour Zion is come, when God's ſervants are brought, by their prayerfulneſs for her reſtoration, in an eminent manner, to ſhew that <hi>they favour her ſtones and duſt. Thou ſhalt ariſe, and have mercy upon Zion; for the time to favour her, yea, the ſet time is come; for thy ſervants take pleaſure in her ſtones, and favour the duſt thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God has reſpect to the prayers of his ſaints in all his government of the world, as we may obſerve by the repreſentation made, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations viii. at the beginning. There we read of ſeven angels ſtanding before the throne of God, and receiving of him ſeven trumpets, at the ſounding of which great and mighty changes were to be brought to paſs in the world, through many ſucceſſive ages. But when theſe angels had received their trumpets, they muſt ſtand ſtill, and all muſt be in ſilence, not one of them muſt be allowed to ſound, until the prayers of the
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:026594_0149_0FD0B328A7CA5EF0"/>ſaints are attended to. The angel of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, as a glorious High Prieſt, comes and ſtands at the altar, with much incenſe, to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with the prayers of all ſaints upon the golden altar, before the throne; and the ſmoke of the incenſe, with the prayers of the ſaints, aſcends up with acceptance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, out of the angel's hand; and then the angels prepare themſelves to ſound.—And God, in the events of every trumpet, remembers thoſe prayers, as appears at laſt, by the great and glorious things he accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhes for his church, in the iſſue of all, in anſwer to theſe prayers, in the event of the laſt trumpet, which brings the glory of the latter days, when theſe prayers ſhall be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into joyful praiſes. Rev. xi. 15, 16, 17. <hi>And the ſeventh angel ſounded, and there were great voices in heaven, ſaying—The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Chriſt; and he ſhall reign for ever and ever. And the four-and-twenty elders, which ſat before God on their ſeats, fell upon their faces, and worſhipped God, ſaying, We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, which art, and waſt, and art to come, becauſe thou haſt taken to thee thy great power, and
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:026594_0150_0FD0B32A3808F0B0"/>haſt reigned.</hi> Since it is thus, that it is the pleaſure of God ſo to honor his people, as to carry on all the deſigns of his kingdom in this way, viz. by the prayers of his ſaints; this gives us great reaſon to think, that whenever the time comes that God gives an extraordinary ſpirit of prayer for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed advancement of his kingdom on earth, (which is God's great aim in all preceding providences, and which is the main thing that the ſpirit of prayer in the ſaints aims at) then the fulfilling this event is nigh.</p>
                  <p>God, in wonderful grace, is pleaſed to repreſent himſelf, as it were, at the command of his people, with regard to mercies of this nature, ſo as to be ready to beſtow them whenever they ſhall earneſtly pray for them. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, the holy O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> of Iſrael, and his maker, Aſk of me of things to come, concerning my ſons, and concerning the work of my hands, command ye me.</hi> What God is ſpeaking of in this context, is the reſtoration of his church; not only a reſtoration from temporal calamity, and an outward captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by Cyrus; but alſo a ſpiritual reſtoration and advancement, by God's commanding the heavens to <hi>drop down from above, and the ſkies to pour down righteouſneſs, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:026594_0151_0FD0B32BB27C35A8"/>the earth to open and bring forth ſalvation, and righteouſneſs to ſpring up together.</hi> God would have his people aſk of him, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of him by earneſt prayer, to do this for them; and manifeſts himſelf as being at the command of earneſt prayers for ſuch a mercy: and a reaſon why God is ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to hear ſuch prayers, is couched in the words, viz. Becauſe it is prayer for his own church, his choſen and beloved people, <hi>his ſons and daughters, and the work of his hands;</hi> and he cannot deny any thing that is aſked for their comfort and proſperity.</p>
                  <p>God ſpeaks of himſelf as ſtanding ready to be gracious to his church, and to appear for its reſtoration, and only waiting for ſuch an opportunity to beſtow this mercy, when he ſhall hear the cries of his people for it, that he may beſtow it in anſwer to their prayers. <hi>Therefore will the Lord wait, that he may be gracious to thee; and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you: For the Lord is a God of judgment; bleſſed are all they that wait for him. For the people ſhall dwell in Zion at Jeruſalem.—Thou ſhalt weep no more; he will be very gracious unto thee, at the voice of thy cry:—when he ſhall hear it, he ſhall anſwer thee.</hi>—
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:026594_0152_0FD0B32D5FABDD48"/>The words imply as much as that when God once ſees his people much engaged in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for this mercy, it ſhall be no longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed. Chriſt deſires to hear the voice of his ſpouſe, <hi>that is in the clefts of the rock, in the ſecret places of the ſtairs;</hi> in a low and obſcure ſtate, driven into ſecret corners: he only waits for this, in order to put an end to her ſtate of affliction, and cauſe <hi>the day to break, and the ſhadows to flee away.</hi> If he once heard her voice in earneſt prayer, he would come ſwifty over <hi>the mountains of ſeparation</hi> between him and her, <hi>as a roe, or young hart.</hi> When his church is in a low ſtate, and oppreſſed by her enemies, and cries to him, he will ſwiftly fly to her relief, as birds fly at the cry of their young. Yea, when that glorious day comes, that I am ſpeaking of, <hi>before they call, he will anſwer them, and while they are yet ſpeaking, he will hear;</hi> and, in anſwer to their prayers, he will make <hi>the wolf and the lamb feed together,</hi> &amp;c. When the ſpouſe prays for the effuſion of the Holy Spirit, and the coming of Chriſt, by granting the tokens of his ſpiritual pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in the church, ſaying, <hi>Awake, O north wind, and come, thou ſouth, blow upon my garden, that the ſpices thereof may flow out;
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:026594_0153_0FD0B32EBB0C5928"/>let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleaſant fruits;</hi> there ſeems to be an immediate anſwer to her prayer, in the next words, in abundant communications of the Spirit, and beſtowment of ſpiritual bleſſings; <hi>I am come into my garden, my ſiſter, my ſpouſe; I have gathered my myrrh with my ſpice; I have eaten my honey-comb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Scripture inſtances and examples of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in prayer, give great encouragement to pray for this mercy. Moſt of the remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able deliverances and reſtorations of the church of God, that we have account of in the ſcriptures, were in anſwer to prayer. So was the redemption of the church of God from the Egyptian bondage. The great reſtoration of the church in the latter day, is ſpoken of as reſembled by this; as in Iſai. lxiv. 1—4. xi. 11, 15, 16. xliii. 2, 3, 16—19. li. 10, 11, 15. lxiii. 11, 12, 13. Zech. x. 10, 11. Hoſ. ii. 14, 15. It was in anſwer to prayer, that the ſun ſtood ſtill over Gibeon, and the moon in the valley of Ajalon, and God's people obtained that great victory over their enemies: in which
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:026594_0154_0FD0B3302ECDA8B0"/>wonderful miracle, God ſeemed to have ſome reſpect to a future more glorious event to be accompliſhed for the chriſtian church, in the day of her victory over her enemies, in the latter days; even that event foretold, Iſai. xl. 20. <hi>Thy ſun ſhall no more go down, neither ſhall thy moon withdraw itſelf.</hi> It was in anſwer to prayer, that God delivered his church from the mighty hoſt of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyrians, in Hezekiah's time; which diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation is abundantly made uſe of, as a type of the great things God will do for the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian church in the latter days, in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies of Iſaiah. The reſtoration of the church of God from the Babyloniſh captivity, as abundantly appears both by ſcripture-prophecies and hiſtories, was in anſwer to extraordinary prayer; ſee Jer. xxix. 10—14. and l. 4, 5. Dan. ix. throughout. Ezra viii. 21, &amp;c. Neh. i. 4. to the end.—iv. 4, 5. and chap. ix. throughout. This reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Jewiſh church, after the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Babylon, is evidently a type of the glorious reſtoration of the chriſtian church, after the deſtruction of the kingdom of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt; which, as all know, is abundantly ſpoken of in the revelation of St. John, as the anti-type of Babylon. Sampſon, out of
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:026594_0155_0FD0B331A7CC8D88"/>weakneſs, received ſtrength to pull down Dagon's temple, through prayer. So the people of God, in the latter days, will, out of weakneſs, be made ſtrong, and will become the inſtruments of pulling down the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Satan, by prayer.</p>
                  <p>The Spirit of God was poured out upon Chriſt himſelf, in anſwer to prayer. <hi>Now when all the people were baptized, it came to paſs, that Jeſus alſo being baptized, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the heaven was opened, and the Holy Ghoſt deſcended in a bodily ſhape like a dove, upon him; and a voice came from heaven, which ſaid, Thou art my beloved Son, in Thee I am well pleaſed.</hi> The Spirit deſcendes on the church of Chriſt, the ſame way, in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, that it deſcended on the head of the church. The greateſt effuſion of the Spir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it that ever yet has been, even that which was in the primitive times of the chriſtian church, which began in Jeruſalem on the day of Pentecoſt, was in anſwer to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary prayer. When the diſciples were gathered together to their Lord, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before his aſcenſion, <hi>he commanded them that they ſhould not depart from Jeruſalem, but wait for the promiſe of the Father, which,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ye have heard of me,</hi> i. e. the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:026594_0156_0FD0B3332D864FE8"/>of the Holy Ghoſt; Acts. i. 4. What they had their hearts upon was the reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the kingdom of Iſrael: <hi>Lord,</hi> ſay they, <hi>wilt thou, at this time, reſtore again the kingdom to Iſrael,</hi> ver. 6. And according to Chriſt's direction, after his aſcenſion, they returned to Jeruſalem, and continued in u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited fervent prayer and ſupplication. It ſeems they ſpent their time in it from day to day, without ceaſing; until the ſpirit came down in a wonderful manner upon them, and that work was begun which never ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, until the world was turned upſide down, and all the chief nations of it were convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to chriſtianity; and that glorious deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance and advancement of the chriſtian church, that was in the days of Conſtantine the Great, followed the extraordinary cries of the church to God, as the matter is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, Rev. vi. at the opening of the fifth ſeal. The church, in her ſuffering ſtate, is repreſented crying with a loud voice, <hi>How long, Lord, holy and true, doſt thou not judge, and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?</hi> And the opening of the next ſeal brings on that mighty revolution, in the days of Conſtantine, compared to thoſe great changes that ſhall be at the end of the world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="156" facs="unknown:026594_0157_0FD0B334A7D5A5A8"/>
As there is ſo great and manifold reaſon from the word of God, to think that if a ſpirit of earneſt prayer for that great effuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Spirit of God which I am ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, prevailed in the chriſtian church, the mercy would be ſoon granted: ſo thoſe that are engaged in ſuch prayer might well expect the firſt benefit. God will come to thoſe that are ſeeking him and waiting for him; Iſai. xxv. 9. and xxxvi. 8. When Chriſt came in the fleſh, he was firſt reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them who were <hi>waiting for the conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Iſrael, and looking for redemption in Jeruſalem.</hi> And in that great out-pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Spirit that was in the days of the apoſtles, which was attended with ſuch glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious effects among the Jews and Gentiles, the Spirit came down firſt on thoſe that were engaged in united earneſt prayer for it.—A ſpecial bleſſing is promiſed to them that love and pray for the proſperity of the church of God. <hi>Pray for the peace of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem. They ſhall proſper, that love thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. We are preſented with many motives in the diſpenſations of Divine Providence, at this day, to excite us to be much in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for this mercy.</p>
                  <p>There is much in Providence to ſhew us
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:026594_0158_0FD0B336733BE3F8"/>our need of it, and put us on deſiring it.— The great outward calamities, in which the world is involved, and particularly the bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy war that embroils and waſtes the nations of Chriſtendom, and in which our nation has ſo great a ſhare, may well make all that believe God's word, and love mankind, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly long and pray for that day, when the wolf ſhall dwell with the lamb, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhall beat their ſwords into plow-ſhares, &amp;c. But eſpecially do the ſpiritual calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and miſeries of the preſent time, ſhew our great need of that bleſſed effuſion of God's Spirit; there having been, for ſo long a time, ſo great a with-holding of the Spirit, from the greater part of the Chriſtian world, and ſuch diſmal conſequences of it, in the great decay of vital piety, and the exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prevalence of infidelity, hereſy, and all manner of vice and wickedneſs; and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in our land and nation; of which a moſt affecting account has lately been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in a pamphlet, printed in London, and re-printed in Scotland, entitled, Britain's Remembrancer; by which it ſeems that lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury, and wickedneſs of almoſt every kind, is well nigh come to the utmoſt extremity in the nation; and if vice ſhould continue to
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:026594_0159_0FD0B337A7D8AB18"/>prevail and increaſe for one generation more, as it has the generation paſt, it looks as tho' the nation could hardly continue in being, but muſt ſink under the weight of its own corruption and wickedneſs. And the ſtate of things in the other parts of the Britiſh do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, beſides England, is very deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The church of Scotland has very much loſt her glory, greatly departing from her ancient purity, and excellent order; and has of late been bleeding with great and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold wounds, occaſioned by their diviſions and hot contentions. And there are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent complaints from thence, by thoſe that lament the corruptions of that land, of fin and wickedneſs, of innumerable kinds, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding and prevailing of late, among all ranks and ſorts of men there. And how la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable is the moral and religious ſtate of theſe American colonies? Of New-England in particular! How much is that kind of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that was profeſſed and much experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced and practiſed, in the firſt, and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently the beſt times in New-England, grown and growing out of credit? What fierce and violent contentions have been of late among miniſters and people, about things of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious nature? How much is the goſpel-miniſtry
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:026594_0160_0FD0B33926271AE8"/>grown into contempt? and the work of the miniſtry, in many reſpects, laid under uncommon difficulties, and even in danger of linking amongſt us?. How many of our congregations and churches rending in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? Church-diſcipline weakened, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances leſs and leſs regarded. What wild and extravagant notions, groſs deluſions of the devil, and ſtrange practices have prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and do ſtill prevail, in many places, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a pretext of extraordinary purity, ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uality, liberty, and zeal againſt formality, uſurpation, and conformity to the world? How ſtrong and deeply rooted and general are the prejudices that prevail againſt vital religion, and the power of godlineſs, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every thing that appertains to it, or tends to it? How apparently are the hearts of people, every where, uncommonly ſhut up againſt all means and endeavours to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken ſinners and revive religion? Vice and immorality, of all kinds, withal increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and unuſually prevailing?—May not an attentive view and conſideration of ſuch a ſtate of things well influence the people that favour the duſt of Zion, to earneſtneſs in their cries to God for a general out-pouring of his Spirit, which only can be an effectual remedy for theſe evils?</p>

Beſides the things that have been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, the freſh attempts made by the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian powers againſt the Proteſtant inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, in their late endeavours to reſtore a Popiſh government in Great Britain, the chief bulwark of the Proteſtant cauſe; as alſo the perſecution lately revived againſt the Proteſtants in France, may well give oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to the people of God, to renewed and extraordinary earneſtneſs in their prayers to him, for the fulfilment of the promiſed down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall of Antichriſt, and that liberty and glory of his church that ſhall follow.</p>
                  <p>As there is much in the preſent ſtate of things to ſhew us our great need of this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and to cauſe us to deſire it; ſo there is very much to convince us, that <hi>God alone can beſtow it,</hi> and ſhew us our entire and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute dependence on him for it. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency of human abilities to bring to paſs any ſuch happy change in the world as is foretold, or to afford any remedy to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, from ſuch miſeries as have been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, does now remarkably appear. Thoſe obſervations of the apoſtle, 1 Cor. i. <hi>The world by wiſdom knows not God, and God makes fooliſh the wiſdom of this world,</hi> never were verified to ſuch a degree as they are
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:026594_0162_0FD0B33C263A3D58"/>now. Great diſcoveries have been made in the arts and ſciences, and never was human learning carried to ſuch a height, as in the preſent age; and yet never did the cauſe of religion and virtue run ſo low, in nations profeſſing the true religion. Never was an age wherein ſo many learned and elaborate treatiſes have been written, in proof of the truth and divinity of the Chriſtian religion; yet never were there ſo many infidels among thoſe that were brought up under the light of the goſpel. It is an age, as is ſuppoſed, of great light, freedom of thought, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of truth in matters of religion, and detection of the weakneſs and bigotry of our anceſtors, and of the ſolly and abſurdity of the notions of thoſe that were accounted e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent divines in former generations; which notions, it is imagined, did deſtroy the very foundations of virtue and religion, and ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate all precepts of morality, and, in effect, annual all difference between virtue and vice; and yet vice and wickedneſs did never ſo prevail, like an overflowing deluge. It is an age wherein thoſe mean and ſtingy principles as they are called, of our forefathers, which, as is ſuppoſed, deformed religion, and led
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:026594_0163_0FD0B33DB318CB98"/>to unworthy thoughts of God, are very much diſcarded, and grown out of credit, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed more free, noble and generous tho'ts of the nature of religion, and of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſcheme are entertained; but yet never was an age, wherein religion in general was ſo much deſpiſed and trampled on, and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt and God Almighty ſo blaſphem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and treated with open daring contempt.</p>
                  <p>The exceeding weakneſs of mankind, and their inſufficiency in themſelves for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to paſs any thing great and good in the world, with regard to its moral and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſtate, remarkably appears in many things that have attended and followed the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary religious commotion, that has late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been in many parts of Great Britain and America. The infirmity of the human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has been manifeſted, in a very affecting manner, in the various paſſions that men have been the ſubjects of, and innumerable ways that they have been moved, as a reed ſhaken with the wind, on occaſion of the changes and incidents, both public and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, of ſuch a ſtate of things. How many errors and extremes are we liable to? How quickly over-topped, blinded, miſled, and confounded? And how eaſily does Satan
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:026594_0164_0FD0B33F2D5967D0"/>make fools of men, if confident in their own wiſdom and ſtrength, and left to themſelves? Many, in the late wonderful ſeaſon, were ready to admire and truſt in men, as if all depended on ſuch and ſuch inſtruments, at leaſt did aſcribe to much to their ſkill and zeal, becauſe God was pleaſed to improve them a little while to do extraordinary things; but what great things does the ſkill and zeal of inſtruments do now, when the Spirit of God is withdrawn?</p>
                  <p>As the preſent ſtate of things may well excite earneſt deſires, after the promiſed ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral revival and advancement of true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and ſerve to ſhew ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>y things in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, of late, that tend to encourage us in prayer for ſuch a mercy. That infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, hereſy and vice do ſo prevail, and that corruption and wickedneſs are riſen to ſuch an extreme height, is that which is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deplorable; but yet, I think, conſidering God's promiſes to his church and the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary method of his diſpenſations, hope may juſtly be gathered from it, that the preſent ſtate of things will not laſt long, but that a happy change is nigh. We know, that God never will deſert the cauſe of truth and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:026594_0165_0FD0B340B11D5188"/>nor ſuffer the gates of hell to prevail againſt the church; and that it has uſually been ſo from the beginning of the world, that the ſtate of the church has appeared moſt dark, juſt before ſome remarkable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance and advancement. <hi>Many a time may Iſrael ſay—Had not the Lord been on our ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>de, then our enemies would have ſwallowed us up quick—The waters had overwhelmed us.</hi> The church's extremity has often been God's opportunity for the magnifying his power, mercy and faithfulneſs towards her. The intereſt of vital piety has long been in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral decaying, and error and wickedneſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing; it looks as though the diſeaſe were now come to a criſis, and that things can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not long remain in ſuch a ſtate, but that a change may be expected in one reſpect or other. And not only God's manner of deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his church in former ages, and many things in the promiſes and prophecies of his word, but alſo ſeveral things appertaining to preſent and late aſpects of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, ſeem to give reaſon to hope that the change will be ſuch, as to magnify God's free grace and ſovereign mercy, and not his revenging juſtice and wrath. There are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain times, that are days of vengeance, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:026594_0166_0FD0B3422A0EEC08"/>for the more ſpecial diſplays of God's juſtice and indignation; and God has alſo his days of mercy, accepted times, choſen ſeaſons, wherein it is his pleaſure to ſhew mercy, and nothing ſhall hinder it; they are times appointed for the magnifying of the Redeemer and his merits, and the triumphs of his grace, wherein his grace ſhall triumph over mens' unworthineſs in its greateſt height. And if we conſider God's late dealings with our nation and this land, it appears to me that there is much to make us think that this day is ſuch a day; particularly God's preſerving and delivering the nation, when in ſo great danger of ruin by the late rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, and his preſerving New-England, and the other Britiſh colonies in America, in ſo remarkable a manner, from the great arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from France, prepared and ſent againſt us the laſt year; and the almoſt miraculous ſucceſs given to us againſt our enemies at Cape-Breton the year before, diſappointing their renewed preparations and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> againſt theſe colonies, this preſent year 1747, by delivering up the ſtrength of their fleet into the hands of the Engliſh, as they were in their way hither. And alſo in protecting 07 us, from time to time, from armies by land,
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:026594_0167_0FD0B343ECF41650"/>that have come againſt us from Canada ſince the beginning of the preſent war with France.

And added to theſe, the late unexpected reſtoring of the greater part of our many captives in Canada, by thoſe that held them priſoners there. It appears to me, that God has gone much out of his uſual way, in his exerciſes of mercy, patience and long-ſuffering in theſe inſtances. God's patience was very wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of old, towards the ten tribes, and the people of Judah and Jeruſalem, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to the Jews in Chriſt's and the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles times; but it ſeems to me, all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, not equal to his patience and mercy to us. God does not only forbear to deſtroy us, notwithſtanding all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> provocations and their aggravations, which it would be endleſs to recount; but he has, in the fore-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inſtances, wrought great things for us, wherein his hand has been moſt viſible, and his arm made bare; eſpecially thoſe two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in America, God's ſucceeding us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Cape-Breton, and confounding the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mada
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:026594_0168_0FD0B34526F91CA0"/>from France the laſt year; diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Providence which, if conſidered in all their circumſtances, were ſo wonderful, and apparently manifeſting an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry divine interpoſition; that they come, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, the neareſt to a parallel with God's wonderful works of old, in Moſes's, Joſhua's, and Hezekiah's time, of any that have been in theſe latter ages of the world. And it is to my preſent purpoſe to obſerve, that God was pleaſed to do great things for us in both theſe inſtances, in anſwer to extraordinary prayer. Such remarkable appearances of a ſpirit of prayer, on any particular public oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, have not been in the land, at any time within my obſervation and memory, as an occaſion of the affair of Cape-Breton.— And it is worthy to be noted and remember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that God ſent that great ſtorm on the fleet of our enemies the laſt year, that final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſperſed, and utterly confounded them, and cauſed them wholly to give over their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns againſt us, the very night after our day of public faſting and prayer, for our protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and their confuſion.</p>
                  <p>Thus, although it be a day of great apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacy and provocation, yet it is apparently a day of the wonderful works of God; wonders
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:026594_0169_0FD0B346B38B53E8"/>of power and mercy, which may well lead us to think on thoſe two places of ſcripture, Pſal. cxix. 126. <hi>It is time for thee, Lord, to work, for they have made void thy law.</hi>— And Pſal. lxxv. 1. <hi>That thy name is near, thy wonderous works declare.</hi>—God appears, as it were, loth to deſtroy us, or deal with us according to our iniquities, as great and aggravated as they are, and ſhews that mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy pleaſes him. As corrupt a time as it is, it is plain, by experience, that it is a time wherein God may be found, and ſtands rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſhew mercy in anſwer to prayer. He that has done ſuch great things, and has ſo wonderfully and ſpeedily anſwered prayer for temporal mercies, will much more give the Holy Spirit if we aſk him. He marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly preſerves us, and waits to be gracious to us, as though he choſe to make us monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his grace, and not his vengeance, and waits only to have us open our mouths wide, that he may fill them.</p>
                  <p>The late remarkable religious awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that have been in many parts of the Chriſtian world, are another thing that may juſtly encourage us in prayer for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed glorious and univerſal out-pouring of
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:026594_0170_0FD0B34876FC62B0"/>the Spirit of God. <q>In or about the year 1732 or 1733, God was pleaſed to pour out his Spirit on the people of Saltzburg, in Germany, who were living under Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh darkneſs, in a moſt uncommon man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; ſo that above twenty thouſand of them, merely by reading the Bible, which they made a ſhift to get in their own lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, were determined to throw off Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery, and embrace the reformed Religion; yea, and to become ſo very zealous for the truth and goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, as to be willing to ſuffer the loſs of all things in the world, and actually to forſake their houſes, lands, goods and relations, that they might enjoy the pure preaching of the goſpel;—with great earneſtneſs, and tears in their eyes, beſeeching Proteſtant miniſters to preach to them, in different places where they came, when baniſhed from their own country.</q>—In the year 1734 and 1735, there appeared a very great and general awakening in the county of Hampſhire, in the province of the Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts-Bay, in New-England, and alſo in many parts of Connecticut. Since this, there
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:026594_0171_0FD0B349A87ADE88"/>has been a far more extenſive awakening of many thouſands in England, Wales, and Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and almoſt all the Britiſh provinces in North America. There has alſo been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing remarkable of the ſame kind in ſome places of the United Netherlands; and about two years ago, a very great awakening and reformation of many of the Indians in the Jerſeys and Pennſylvania, even among ſuch as never embraced Chriſtianity before; and within theſe two years, a great awakening in Virginia and Maryland. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great diverſity of opinions about the iſſue of ſome of theſe awakenings, yet I know of none that have denied that there have been great awakenings of late, in theſe times and places, and that multitudes have been brought to more than common concern for their ſalvation, and for a time were made more than ordinarily afraid of ſin, and bro't to reform their former vicious courſes, and take much pains for their ſalvation. If I ſhould be of the opinion of thoſe that think theſe awakenings and ſtrivings of God's Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit have been generally not well improved, and ſo, as to moſt, have not iſſued well, but have ended in enthuſiaſm and deluſion, yet,
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:026594_0172_0FD0B34B2F642FD8"/>that the Spirit of God has been of late ſo wonderfully awakening and ſtriving with ſuch multitudes, in ſo many different parts of the world, and even to this day, in one place or other, continues to awaken men, is what I ſhould take great encouragement from, that God was about to do ſomething more glorious, and would, before he finiſhes, bring things to a greater ripeneſs, and not finally ſuffer this work of his to be fruſtrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and rendered abortive by Satan's crafty management; and that theſe unuſual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions are the forerunners of ſomething ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly glorious approaching; as the wind, earthquake and fire, at Mount Sinai, were forerunners of that voice, wherein God was, in a more eminent manner; although they alſo were cauſed by a divine power, as it is repreſented, that theſe things were cauſed by the <hi>Lord paſſing by.</hi> 1 Kings xix. 11, 12.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. How condecent, how beautiful, and of good tendency would it be, for multitudes of Chriſtians, in various parts of the world, by explicit agreement, to unite <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>rtains to human ſociety; yea, it is
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:026594_0173_0FD0B34CA66C22C8"/>one of the moſt beautiful and happy things on earth, which indeed makes earth moſt like heaven. God has made of one blood all nations of men, to dwell on all the face of the earth; hereby teaching us this moral leſſon, that it becomes mankind all to be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited as one family. And this is agreeable to the nature that God has given men, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing them to ſociety; and the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances God has placed them in, ſo many ways obliging and neceſſitating them to it. A civil union, or an harmonious agreement among men, in the management of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular concerns, is amiable; but much more a pious union, and ſweet agreement in the great buſineſs for which man was created, and had powers given him beyond the brutes; even the buſineſs of religion, the life and ſoul of which is love. Union is ſpoken of in ſcripture as the peculiar beauty of the church of Chriſt, Cant. vi. 9. <hi>My dove, my undefiled is but one, ſhe is the only one of her mother, ſhe is the choice one of her that bare her; the daughters ſaw her and bleſſed her, yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praiſed her.</hi> Pſal. cxxii. 5. <hi>Jeruſalem is build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a city that is compact together.</hi> Eph. iv.
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:026594_0174_0FD0B34E2660C888"/>3—6. <hi>Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. There is one body and one ſpirit; even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptiſm, one God, and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.</hi> Ver. 16. <hi>The whole body fitly framed togeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and compacted, by that which every joint ſupplieth, according to the effectual working in the meaſure of every part, maketh increaſe of the body, unto the ediſying itſelf in love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As it is the glory of the church of Chriſt, that ſhe, in all her members, however diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed, is thus one, one holy ſociety, one city, one family, one body; ſo it is very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable, that this union ſhould be manifeſted, and become viſible; and ſo, that her diſtant members ſhould act as one, in thoſe things that concern the common intereſt of the whole body, and in thoſe duties and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes wherein they have to do with their common lord and head, as ſeeking of him the common proſperity. It becomes all the members of a particular family, who are ſtrictly united, and have in ſo many reſpects one common intereſt, to unite in prayer to God for the things they need; it becomes a
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:026594_0175_0FD0B34FC95D1458"/>nation, in days of prayer, appointed by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional authority, at certain ſeaſons, viſibly to unite in prayer for thoſe public mercies that concern the intereſt of the whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo it becomes the church of Chriſt, which is one holy nation, a peculiar people, one heavenly family, more ſtrictly united, in many reſpects, and having infinitely great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er intereſts that are common to the whole, than any other ſociety; I ſay, it eſpecially becomes this ſociety, viſibly to unite, and expreſsly to agree together in prayer to God for the common proſperity; and above all, that common proſperity and advancement that is ſo unſpeakably great and glorious, which God has ſo abundantly promiſed to fulfil in the latter days.</p>
                  <p>It is becoming of Chriſtians, with whoſe character a narrow ſelfiſh ſpirit, above all others, diſagrees, to be much in prayer for that public mercy, wherein conſiſts the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare and happineſs of the whole body of Chriſt, of which they are members, and the greateſt good of mankind. And union or agreement in prayer is eſpecially becoming, when Chriſtians pray for that mercy, which above all other things concerns them unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly,
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:026594_0176_0FD0B35142E7E968"/>and tends to the relief, proſperity and glory of the whole body, as well as of each individual member.</p>
                  <p>Such an union in prayer for the general out-pouring of the Spirit of God, would not only be beautiful, but profitable too. It would tend very much to promote union and charity between diſtant members of the church of Chriſt, to promote public ſpirit, love to the church of God, and concern for the intereſt of Zion, as well as be an amiable exerciſe and manifeſtation of ſuch a ſpirit.—Union in religious duties, eſpecially in the duty of prayer, in praying one with and for another, and jointly for their common wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, above almoſt all other things, tends to promote mutual affection and endearment. And if miniſters and people ſhould, by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular agreement and joint reſolution, ſet themſelves, in a ſolemn and extraordinary manner, from time to time, to pray for the revival of religion in the world, it would na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally tend more to awaken in them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="5 letters">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern about things of this nature, and more of a deſire after ſuch a mercy; it would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage them to more attention to ſuch an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair make them more inquiſitive about it, more ready to uſe endeavours to promote
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:026594_0177_0FD0B352A7998ED8"/>that which they, with ſo many others, ſpend ſo much time in praying for, and more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to rejoice and praiſe God when they ſee or hear of any thing of that nature or ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency; and in a particular manner, would it naturally tend to engage miniſters (the buſineſs of whoſe life it is, to ſeek the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the church of Chriſt, and the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his kingdom) to greater diligence and earneſtneſs in their work; and it would have a tendency to the ſpiritual profit and advantage of each particular perſon. For perſons to be thus engaged in extraordinary praying for the revival and flouriſhing of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in the world, will naturally lead each one to reflect on himſelf, and conſider how religion flouriſhes in his own heart, and how far his example contributes to the thing that he is praying for.</p>

The encouragement to explicit agreement in prayer is great from ſuch inſtances as theſe; but it is yet greater from thoſe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful words of our bleſſed Redeemer. Mat. xviii. 19. <hi>I ſay unto you, that if any two of you ſhall agree on earth touching any thing that they ſhall aſk, it ſhall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.</hi> Chriſt is pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give this great encouragement to the union of his followers in this excellent and holy exerciſe of ſeeking and ſerving God; an holy union and communion of his people being that which he greatly deſires and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in, that which he came into the world to bring to paſs, that which he eſpecially prayed for with his dying breath, John xvii. that which he died for, and which was one chief end of the whole affair of our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by him.

                     <hi>Object.</hi> 1. Some may be ready to ſay, That for Chriſtians, in ſuch a manner to ſet apart certain ſeaſons, every week, and every quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to be religiouſly obſerved and kept for the purpoſes propoſed, from year to year, would be, in effect, to eſtabliſh certain peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odical times of human invention and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, to be kept holy to God, and ſo to do the very thing, that has ever been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected againſt, by a very great part of the moſt eminent Chriſtians and Divines among Proteſtants, as what men have no right to do, it being for them to add to God's inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, and introduce their own inventions and eſtabliſhments into the ſtated worſhip of God, and lay unwarrantable bonds on mens' conſciences, and do what naturally tends to ſuperſtition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> To this I would ſay, There can be no juſtice in ſuch an objection againſt this
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:026594_0181_0FD0B358C9722AC8"/>propoſal, as made to us in the ſoremention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed memorial. Indeed, that caution and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence appears in the projection itſelf, and in the manner in which it is propoſed to us, that there is not ſo much as any colour for the objection. The propoſal is ſuch, and ſo well guarded, that there ſeems to be no room for the weakeſt Chriſtian that well obſerves it, ſo to miſtake it, as to underſtand thoſe things to be implied in it, that have, indeed, been objected againſt, by many eminent Chriſtians and Divines among Proteſtanis, as entangling mens' conſciences, and adding to divine inſtitutions, &amp;c.—Here is no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of eſtabliſhing any thing by authority; no appearance of any claim of power in the propoſers, or right to have any regard paid to their determinations or propoſals, by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of any deference due to them, in any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, any more than to every individual perſon of thoſe that they apply themſelves to. So far from that, that they expreſsly mention that which they have thought of, as what they would propoſe to the thoughts of others, for their amendments and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements, declaring that they chuſe rather to receive and ſpread the directions and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals of others, than to be the firſt authors
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:026594_0182_0FD0B35A39873FC8"/>of any.—No times, not ſanctified by God's own inſtitution, are propoſed to be obſerved more than others, under any notion of ſuch times being, in any reſpect, more holy, or more honorable, or worthy of any preference, or diſtinguiſhing regard; either as being ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, or made honorable, by authority, or by any great events of Divine Providence, or any relation to any holy perſons or things; but only as circumſtantially convenient, help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to memory, eſpecially free from worldly buſineſs, near to the times of the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of public ordinances, &amp;c. None at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to lay any bonds on others, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to this matter, or to deſire that they ſhould lay any bonds on themſelves, or look on themſelves as under any obligations, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by power or promiſe; or ſo much as come into any abſolute determination in their own minds, to ſet apart any ſtated days from ſecular affairs, or even to fix on any part of ſuch days, without liberty to alter cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, as ſhall be found expedient, and alſo liberty left to a future alteration of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as to expediency, on further trial and conſideration. All that is propoſed is, that ſuch as fall in with what is propoſed in their judgments and inclinations, while they do
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:026594_0183_0FD0B35BF0EC3B20"/>ſo, ſhall ſtrengthen, aſſiſt and encourage their brethren that are of the ſame mind, by viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conſenting and joining with them in the affair. Is here any thing like making laws in matters of conſcience and religion, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding mens' inſtitutions to God's, or any ſhew of impoſition, or ſuperſtitious eſteeming and preferring one day above another, or any poſſible ground of entanglement of any one's conſcience?</p>
                  <p>For men to go about by law to eſtabliſh and limit circumſtances of worſhip, not eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed or limited by any law of God, ſuch as preciſe time, place, and order, may be in many reſpects of dangerous tendency. But ſurely it cannot be unlawful or improper for Chriſtians to come into ſome agreement with regard to theſe circumſtances, for it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to carry on any ſocial worſhip without it. There is no inſtitution of ſcripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring any people to meet together to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God in ſuch a ſpot of ground, or at ſuch an hour of the day; but yet theſe muſt be determined by agreement, or elſe there will be no ſocial worſhip, in any place, or any hour. So we are not determined by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, what the preciſe order of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent part<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

If a congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Chriſtians do agree to begin their public worſhip with prayer, and next to ſing, and then to attend on the preaching of the word, and to conclude with prayer; and do by conſent carry on their worſhip in this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from year to year, though this order is not appointed in ſcripture, none will call this ſuperſtition. And if a great number of congregations, through a whole land, or more lands than one do, by common conſent, keep the ſame method of public worſhip, none will pretend to find fault with it. But yet for any to go about to bind all to ſuch a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, would be uſurpation and impoſition. And if ſuch a preciſe order ſhould be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as ſacred, as though no other could be acceptable to God, this would be ſuperſtition. —If a particular number of Chriſtians ſhall agree, that beſides the ſtated public worſhip of the ſabbath, they will, when their circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances allow, meet together to carry on
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:026594_0185_0FD0B35EA766FD88"/>ſome religous exerciſes on a ſabbath-day night, for their mutual edification; or if ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſocieties agree to meet together in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent places at that time, this is no ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, though there be no inſtitution for it. If people in different congregations volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily agree to take turns to meet together in the houſe of God, to worſhip him and hear a public lecture, once a month, or once in ſix weeks; it is not unlawful, though there be no inſtitution for it; but yet to do this as a thing ſacred, indiſpenſible, and bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on mens' conſciences, would be ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition. If Chriſtians of ſeveral neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing congregations, inſtead of a lecture, agree on ſome ſpecial occaſion to keep a circular faſt, each congregation taking its turn in a certain time and order, fixed on by conſent; or inſtead of keeping faſt by turns, on diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent days, one on one week, and one on an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, they ſhould all agree to keep a faſt on the ſame day, and to do this either once or frequently, according as they ſhall judge their own circumſtances, or the diſpenſations of the Divine Providence, or the importance of the mercy they ſeek, do require; neither is there any more ſuperſtition in this than the other.</p>

It appears, from what was before obſerved, that there ought to be extraordinary prayers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chriſtians for this mercy; and that it is ſit, that God's people ſhould agree and unite in it. Though there be no reaſon to ſuppoſe that prayers will be more prevalent, merely from that circumſtance, that differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent perſons pray exactly at the ſame time; yet there will be more reaſon to hope, that prayers for ſuch mercy will be prevalent, when God's people are very much in prayer for it, and when many of them are united in it. If therefore agreeing on certain times for united and extraordinary prayer, be a like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly means to promote an union of many in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary prayer, then there is more reaſon to hope that there will be prevalent prayer for ſuch a mercy, for certain times for extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary prayer being agreed on.

For God's people, in diſtant places, to agree on certain times for extraordinary pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, wherein they will unitedly put up their requeſts to God, is a means fit and proper to be uſed, in order to the viſibility of their union in ſuch prayer. Union among God's people in prayer is truly beautiful, as has been before obſerved and ſhewn; it is beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful in the eyes of Chriſt, and it is juſtly beautiful and amiable in the eyes of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians.

Worſhip it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf becomes viſible worſhip, by ſomething external and viſible belonging to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and no other way; therefore union and agreement of many in worſhip becomes vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible no other way, but by union and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the external and viſible acts and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the worſhip.

This the common light and ſenſe of God's people leads Chriſtians to in all coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. And the wiſdom of God ſeems to dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the ſame thing, in appointing that his people, through the world, in all ages, in their ſtated and ordinary public worſhip, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very week, ſhould manifeſt this union and communion one with another, in their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as one holy ſociety, and great congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of worſhippers, and ſervants of God, by offering up their worſhip on the ſame day, for the greater glory of their common Lord, and the greater edification and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the whole body.</p>
                  <p>If any yet find fault with the propoſal of certain times to be agreed on by God's peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in different places, in the manner ſet forth in the memorial, I would aſk whether
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:026594_0192_0FD0B364C097BBC0"/>they object againſt any ſuch thing, as a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble agreement of God's people, in different parts of the world, in extraordinary prayer, for the comming of Chriſt's kingdom? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch a thing, being viſible, would not be much for the public honor of Gods name? And whether it would not tend to Chriſtians aſſiſtance, quickening and encouragement in the duty united in, by mutual example, and alſo to their mutual comfort, by a manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of that union which is amiable to Chriſt and Chriſtians, and to promote a Chriſtian union among profeſſing Chriſtians in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral? And whether we have not reaſon to think, from the word of God, that before that great revival of religion foretold is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, there will be a viſible union of the people of God, in various parts of the world, in extraordinary prayer, for this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy? If theſe things are allowed, I would then aſk further, whether any method can be thought of or deviſed, whereby an expreſs agreement, and viſible union of God's peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in different parts of the world, can be come into, and maintained, but this, or ſome other equivalent to it? If there be any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs agreement about any extraordinary
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:026594_0193_0FD0B366347F1258"/>prayer at all, it muſt firſt be propoſed by ſome, and others muſt fall in, in the manner as is repreſented in my text. And if extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary prayer be agreed on and maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by many in different places, viſibly one to another, then it muſt be agreed in ſome reſpect, and with regard to ſome circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, what extraordinary prayer ſhall be kept up; and it muſt be ſeen and heard of, from one to another, what extraordinary prayer is kept up. But how ſhall this be, when no times are agreed upon, and it is never known nor heard, by thoſe in different parts, nor is in any reſpect viſible to them, when, or how often, thoſe in one town or country, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other do attend this extraordinary prayer? The conſequence muſt neceſſarily be, that it can never be known how far, or in what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect others join with them in extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prayer, or whether they do it at all; and not ſo much as one circumſtance of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary prayer will be viſible; and indeed nothing will be viſible about it. So that I think any body that well conſiders the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, will ſee, that he who determines to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſuch a method as is propoſed to us in the memorial, and all others equivalent to
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:026594_0194_0FD0B367A7A3C808"/>it is, in effect, determined to oppoſe there ever being any ſuch thing at all, as an agreed and viſibly united extraordinary prayer, in the church of God, for a general out-pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Though it would not be reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that merely ſuch a circumſtance of prayer, as many people's praying at the ſame time will directly have any influence or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valence with God, to cauſe him to be the more ready to hear prayer; yet ſuch a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance may reaſonably be ſuppoſed to have influence on the minds of men; as the conſideration of it may tend to encourage and aſſiſt thoſe in praying, that are united in prayer. Will any deny, that it has any reaſonable tendency to encourage, animate, or in any reſpect to help the mind of a Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian in ſerving God in any duty of religion, to join with a Chriſtian congregation, and to ſee an aſſembly of his dear brethren around him, at the ſame time engaged with him in the ſame duty? And ſuppoſing one in this aſſembly of ſaints is blind, and ſees no one there, but has by other means ground of ſatisfaction that there is preſent at that
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:026594_0195_0FD0B36926367880"/>time a multitude of God's people, that are united with him in the ſame ſervice, will any deny, that his ſuppoſing this, and being ſatisfied of it, can have any reaſonable influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon his mind, to excite and encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age him, or in any reſpect to aſſiſt him in his worſhip? The encouragement or help that one that joins with an aſſembly in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping God, has in his worſhip, by others being united with him, is not merely by any thing that he immediately perceives by ſight, or any other of the external ſenſes (for uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in worſhip is not a thing objected to the external ſenſes;) but by the notice or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the mind has of that union, or the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction the underſtanding has that others, at that time, have their minds engaged with him in the ſame ſervice; which may be when thoſe unitedly engaged are at a diſtance one from another, as well as when they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. If one be preſent in a worſhipping aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, and is not blind, and ſees others pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and ſees their external behaviour, their union and engagedneſs with him in worſhip is what he does not ſee, and what he ſees encourages and aſſiſts him in his worſhip, only as; he takes it as an evidence of that union and concurrence in his worſhip, that
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:026594_0196_0FD0B36BA894FA20"/>is out of his ſight. And perſons may have evidence of this concerning perſons that are abſent, that may give him as much ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their union with him, as if they were preſent. And therefore the conſideration of others being at the ſame time engaged with him in worſhip, that are abſent, may as reaſonably animate and encourage him in his worſhip as if they were preſent.</p>
                  <p>There is no wiſdom in finding fault with human nature, as God has made it. Things that exiſt now, at this preſent time, are, in themſelves, no more weighty or important, than like things, and of equal reality, that exiſted in time paſt, or are to exiſt in time to come; yet it is evident, that the conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of things being preſent (at leaſt in moſt caſes) does eſpecially affect human nature. As for inſtance, if a man ſhould be certainly informed, that his dear child, at a diſtance, was now under ſome extreme ſuffering, or that an abſent moſt dear friend was at this time thinking of him, and in the exerciſe of great affection towards him, or in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of ſome great deed of friendſhip; or if a pious parent ſhould know that now his child was in the act of ſome enormous wickedneſs; or that, on the contrary, he was
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:026594_0197_0FD0B36C8AE0DDC8"/>now in ſome eminent exerciſe of grace, and in the performance of an extraordinary deed of virtue and piety; would not thoſe things be more affecting to the human nature, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſidered as things that are in exiſtence at the preſent time, than if conſidered as at ſome diſtance of time, either paſt or future? Hundreds of other inſtances might be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned wherein it is no leſs plain, that the conſideration of the preſent exiſtence of things gives them advantage to affect the minds of men. Yea, it is undoubtedly ſo with things in general, that take any hold at all of our affections, and towards which we are not indifferent. And if the mind of a particular child of God is diſpoſed to be affected by the conſideration of the religion of other ſaints, and with their union and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence with him in any particular duty or act of religion, I can ſee no reaſon why the human mind ſhould not be more moved by the object of its affection, when conſidered as preſent, as well in this caſe, as in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſe; yea, I think, we may on good grounds determine there is none.</p>
                  <p>Nor may we look upon it as an inſtance of the peculiar weakneſs of the human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:026594_0198_0FD0B36DB3D0E098"/>that men are more affected with things that are conſidered as preſent, than thoſe that are diſtant; but it ſeems to be a thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to finite minds, and ſo to all created in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent beings. Thus, the angels in heaven have peculiar joy, on occaſion of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of a ſinner, when recent, beyond what they have in that which has been long paſt. If any therefore ſhall call it ſilly and whimſical in any, to value and regard ſuch a circumſtance, in things of religion, as their exiſting at the preſent time, ſo as to be the more affected wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> them for that, they muſt call the hoſt of angels in heaven a parcel of ſilly and whimſical beings.</p>
                  <p>I remember, the Spectator (whom none will call a whimſical author) ſomewhere ſpeaking of different ways of dear friends mutually expreſſing their affection, and maintaining a kind of intercourſe, in abſence one from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, mentions ſuch an inſtance as this, with much approbation, viz. That two friends, that were greatly endeared one to another, when about to part, and to be for a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable time neceſſarily abſent, that they might have the comfort of the enjoyment of daily mutual expreſſions of friendſhip, in their abſence, agreed that they would, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:026594_0199_0FD0B36F25DF09B0"/>day, preciſely at ſuch an hour, retire from all company and buſineſs, to pray for one another. Which agreement they ſo valued, and ſo ſtrictly obſerved, that when the hour came, ſcarce any thing would hinder them. And rather than miſs this opportunity, they would ſuddenly break off converſation, and abruptly leave the company they were engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with.—If this be a deſirable way of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of particular friends, is it not a deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and amiable way of maintaining inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and fellowſhip between brethren in Chriſt Jeſus, and the various members of the holy family of God, in different parts of the world, to come into an agreement, that they will ſet apart certain times, which they will ſpend with one accord, in extraordinary prayer to their heavenly Father, for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of the kingdom, and the glory of their common dear Lord and Saviour, and for each other's proſperity and happineſs, and the greateſt good of all their fellow-creatures through the world?</p>

Some perhaps may object, That it looks too much like Phariſaiſm, when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons engage in any ſuch extraordinary reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious exerciſes, beyond what is appointed by expreſs inſtitution, for them thus deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:026594_0200_0FD0B370A92D3AB0"/>to make it manifeſt abroad in the world, and ſo openly to diſtinguiſh themſelves from others.</p>

All openly engaging in extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary exerciſes of religion, not expreſsly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined by inſtitution, is not Phariſaiſm, nor has ever been ſo reputed in the Chriſtian church. As when a particular church or congregation of Chriſtians agree together to keep a day of faſting and prayer, on ſome ſpecial occaſion; or when public days of faſting and thankſgiving are kept, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Chriſtian province or country; and though it be ordinarily the manner for the civil magiſtrate to lead, in the ſetting apart ſuch days, yet that alters not the caſe; if it be Phariſaiſm in the ſociety openly to agree in ſuch extraordinary exerciſes of religion, it is not leſs Phariſaiſm for the heads of the ſociety leading in the affair. And if that were now the caſe with the Chriſtian church, that once was, for about three hundred years together, that the civil magiſtrate was not of the ſociety of Chriſtians, nor concerned himſelf in their affairs; yet this would not render it the leſs ſuitable for Chriſtians, on proper occaſions, jointly, and viſibly one to another, to engage in ſuch extraordinary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:026594_0201_0FD0B372A3362900"/>of religion, and to keep days of faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and thankſgiving by agreement.</p>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 2. As to the latter part of the objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there can be no room for it in this caſe. It cannot be objected againſt what is propoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the memorial, that if perſons ſhould comply with it, it would look like affecting ſingularity, and open diſtinction from others of God's profeſſing people, in extraordinary religion, ſuch as was in the Phariſees of old; becauſe it is evident, the very deſign of the memorial, is not to promote ſingularity and diſtinction, but as much as poſſible to avoid and prevent it. The end of the memorial is not to confine and limit the thing propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that it may be practiſed only by a few, in diſtinction from the generality; but on the contrary to extend it, and make it as gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral among profeſſing Chriſtians as poſſible. Some had complied with the extraordinary duty propoſed, and therein had been diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from others, for two years, before the memorial was publiſhed; and they were more diſtinguiſhed than they deſired, and therefore ſend abroad this memorial, that the practice might be more ſpread, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more general, that they might be leſs diſtinguiſhed. What they evidently ſeek, is
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:026594_0202_0FD0B373A97674C8"/>to bring to paſs as general a compliance as poſſible of Chriſtians of all denominations, <q>intreating, that the deſire of concurrence and aſſiſtance, contained in the memorial, may by no means be underſtood, as reſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to any particular denomination or party, or thoſe who are of ſuch or ſuch opinions about any former inſtances of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable religious concern; but to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to all, who ſhall vouchſafe any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the propoſal, and have at heart the intereſt of vital Chriſtianity, and the power of godlineſs; and who, however dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering about other things, are convinced of the importance of fervent prayer, to promote that common intereſt, and of ſcripture perſuaſives, to promote ſuch prayer.</q>

Another objection, that is very likely to ariſe in the minds of many againſt ſuch extraordinary prayer as is propoſed for the ſpeedy coming of Chriſt's kingdom, is that we have no reaſon to expect it, until there firſt come a time of moſt extreme calamity to the church of God, and prevalence of her anti-chriſtian enemies againſt her; even that which is repreſented, Rev. xi. by the ſlaying

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is an opinion that ſeems pretty much to have obtained, that before the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filment of the promiſes relating to the church's latter-day glory, there muſt come a moſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible time, a time of extreme ſuffering, and dreadful perſecution of the church of Chriſt, wherein Satan and Antichriſt are to obtain their greateſt victory over her, and ſhe is to be bro't lower than eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> by her enemies. Which opinion has chiefly riſen from the manner of interpreting and applying the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned prophecy of the ſlaying of the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. This opinion, with ſuch perſons as retain it, muſt needs be a great reſtraint and hindrance, with regard to ſuch an affair as is propoſed to us in the memorial. If per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons expect no other, than that the more the glorious times of Chriſt's kingdom are haſtened, the ſooner will come this dreadful time, wherein the generality of God's peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple muſt ſuffer ſo extremely, and the church of Chriſt be almoſt extinguiſhed, and blotted out from under heaven; how can it be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, than a great damp to their hope, courage and activity, in praying for and reaching after the ſpeedy introduction of
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:026594_0204_0FD0B376A5A57F38"/>thoſe glorious promiſed times? As long as this opinion is retained, it will undoubtedly ever have this unhappy influence on the minds of thoſe that wiſh well to Zion, and favor her ſtones and duſt. It will tend to damp, deaden, and keep down life, hope, and joyful expectation in prayer; and even in great meaſure, to prevent all earneſt, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated and encouraged prayer, in God's peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for this mercy, at any time before it is actually fulfilled. For they that proceed on this hypotheſis in their prayers, muſt, at the ſame time that they pray for this glorious day, naturally conclude within themſelves, that they ſhall never live to ſee on the earth any dawning of it, but only to ſee the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal time that ſhall precede it, in which the far greater part of God's people, that ſhall live until then, ſhall die under the extreme cruelties of their perſecutors. And the more they expect that God will anſwer their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, by ſpeedy bringing on the promiſed glorious day, the more muſt they withal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect themſelves to have a ſhare in thoſe dreadful things, that nature ſhrinks at the thoughts of, and alſo expect to ſee things that a renewed nature ſhrinks at and dreads; even the prevailing of God's enemies, and
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:026594_0205_0FD0B3784E136C90"/>the almoſt total extinguiſhing the true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in the world. And on this hypotheſis, theſe diſcouragements are like to attend the prayers of God's people, until that diſmal time be actually come; and when that is come, thoſe that had been propheſying and praying in ſackcloth, ſhall generally be ſlain; and after that time is over, then the glorious day ſhall immediately commence. So that this notion tends to diſcourage and hinder all earneſt prayer in the church of God for that glorious coming of Chriſt's kingdom, until it be actually come; and that is to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der its ever being at all.</p>
                  <p>It being ſo, this opinion being of ſuch hurtful tendency, certainly it is a thouſand pities it ſhould prevail and be retained, if truly there be no good ground for it.</p>
                  <p>Therefore in anſwer to this objection, I would, with all humility and modeſty, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the foundation of that opinion, of ſuch a dreadful time of victory of Antichriſt over the church, yet to be expected: and particularly ſhall endeavour to ſhew that the <hi>ſtaying of the witneſſes,</hi> foretold, Rev. xi. 7—10. is not an event that remains yet to be fulfilled.—To this end, I would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

1. The time wherein the <hi>witneſſes he dead in the ſtreets of the great city,</hi> doubtleſs, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the time wherein the true church of Chriſt is loweſt of all, moſt of all prevailed againſt by Antichriſt, and neareſt to an ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter extinction; the time wherein there is left the leaſt viſibility of the church of Chriſt yet ſubſiſting in the world, leaſt remains of any thing appertaining to true religion, whence a revival of it can be expected, and wherein all means of it are moſt aboliſhed, and the ſtate of the church is, in all reſpects, furtheſt from any thing whence any hopes of its ever flouriſhing again might ariſe. For before this the witneſſes <hi>propheſy in ſackcloth.</hi> but now they are <hi>dead;</hi> before this they were kept low indeed, yet there was life, and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to bring plagues on their enemies, and ſo much of true religion leſt, as to be a contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual eye-ſore and torment to them; but now their enemies rejoice and feaſt, and have a general public triumph, as having obtained a full victory over them, and having entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extirpated them, and being completely delivered from them, and all that might give them any fear of being troubled with them any more. This time, wherever it be fixed, doubtleſs, it the time, not only wherein feweſt
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:026594_0207_0FD0B37B3838BB10"/>profeſſors of the true religion are left in the world, but a time wherein the truth ſhall be fartheſt out of ſight, and out of reach, and moſt forgotten; wherein there are left few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt beams of light, or traces of truth, feweſt means of information, and opportunities of coming to the knowledge of the truth; and ſo a time of the moſt barbarous ignorance, moſt deſtitute of all hiſtory, reliques, monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and memory of things appertaining to true religion, or things, the knowledge of which hath any tendency to bring truth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to light, and moſt deſtitute of learning, ſtudy and enquiry.</p>
                  <p>Now, if we conſider the preſent ſtate of mankind, it is credible that a time will yet come in the world, that in theſe reſpects ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds all times that were before the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation? And that ſuch a time will come before the fall of Antichriſt, unleſs we ſet that at a much greater diſtance, than the farth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt that any yet have ſuppoſed? It is next to impoſſible, that ſuch a change ſhould be brought about in ſo ſhort a time—it cannot be without a miracle. In order to it, not only muſt the Popiſh nations ſo prevail, as utterly to extirpate the Proteſtant religion through the earth, but muſt do many other
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:026594_0208_0FD0B37CA74D18A0"/>things, far more impoſſible for them to effect, in order to cover the world with ſo groſs and confirmed a darkneſs, and to bury all light and truth in ſo deep an oblivion, and ſo far out of all means and hopes of a revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val. And not only muſt a vaſt change be made in the Proteſtant world, but the Popiſh nations muſt be ſtrangely metamorphoſed, and they themſelves muſt be terribly perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by ſome other power, in order to bring them to ſuch a change; nor would perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution without extirpation be ſufficient for it. If there ſhould be another univerſal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge, it might be ſufficient to bring things in the world to ſuch a paſs, provided a few ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant barbarous perſons only were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in an ark; and it would require ſome cataſtrophe, not much ſhort of this, to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the Reformation, that was in the days of Luther, Calvin, and others their contemporaries, the threatened deſtruction of Antichriſt, that dreadful enemy that had long oppreſſed and worn out the ſaints, was begun; nor was it a ſmall beginning, but Antichriſt hath fallen, at leaſt, halfway to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e ground, from that height of power and
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:026594_0209_0FD0B37E2E60B228"/>grandeur, that he was in before. Then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the vials of God's wrath to be <hi>poured out on the throne of the beaſt,</hi> to the great ſhaking of its foundations, and diminution of its extent; ſo that the Pope loſt near half of his former dominions, and as to degree of authority and influence over what is left, he is not poſſeſſed of what he had before. God now at length, in anſwer to the long contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued cries of his people, awaked as one out of ſleep, and began to deliver his church from her exceeding low ſtate, the ſhe had continued in for many ages, under the great oppreſſion of this grand enemy, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore her from her exile and bondage in the ſpiritual Babylon and Egypt. And it is not agreeable to the analogy of God's diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that after this, God ſhould deſert his people, and hide himſelf from them, even more than before, and leave them more than ever in the hands of their enemy, and all this advantage of the church againſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt ſhould be entirely given up and loſt, and the power and tyranny of Antichriſt be more confirmed, and the church brought more under, and more entirely ſubdued than ever before, and further from all help and means to recover. This is not God's way
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:026594_0210_0FD0B37FB904A248"/>of dealing with his people, or with their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies; his work of ſalvation is perfect— when he has begun ſuch a work he will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it on—when he once cauſes the day of deliverance to dawn to his people, after ſuch a long night of diſmal darkneſs, he will not extinguiſh the light, and cauſe them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again to midnight darkneſs—when he has begun to enkindle the bleſſed fire, he will not quench the ſmoaking flax, until he had brought forth judgment unto victory. When once the church, after her long la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and ſore travail, has brought forth her man-child, and wrought ſome deliverance, her enemies ſhall never be able to deſtroy this child, though an infant, but it ſhall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend up to heaven, and be ſet on high out of their reach.</p>
                  <p>The deſtruction that God often foretold and threatened to ancient Babylon (which is often referred to in the Revelation, as a great type of the anti-chriſtian church) was gradually accompliſhed, and fulfilled by va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſteps, at a great diſtance of time one from another; it was begun in the conqueſt of Cyrus, and was further accompliſhed by Darius, about eighteen years after, by a yet
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:026594_0211_0FD0B38150623AA8"/>greater deſtruction, wherein it was brought much nearer to utter deſolation; but it was about two hundred and twenty-three years after this, before the ruin of it was perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the prophecies againſt it fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, in its being made an utter and perpetual deſolation, without any human in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant, becoming the dwelling-place for owls, dragons, and other doleful creatures. But yet when God had once begun to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy her, he went on until he finiſhed, and never ſuffered her any more to recover and eſtabliſh her former empire. So the reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Jewiſh church, after the Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniſh captivity, was gradual, by various ſteps; there were ſeveral times of return of the Jews from captivity, and ſeveral diſtinct decrees of the Perſian emperors, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring and rebuilding Jeruſalem, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhing the Jewiſh church and ſtate; and it was done in turbulent times, there were great interruptions and checks, and violent oppoſitions, and times wherein the enemy did much prevail: But yet, when God had once begun the work he alſo made an end; he never ſuffered the enemies of the Jews to bring Jeruſalem to ſuch a ſtate of deſolation as it had been in before, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ntil
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:026594_0212_0FD0B382B4CFE5C0"/>the promiſed reſtoration was complete. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, the deliverance of God's church from the oppreſſion of Antiochus Epiphanes, (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother known type of Antichriſt) was gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual; they were firſt aſſiſted in a ſmall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, by the Maccabees, and afterwards the promiſed deliverance was completed, in the recovery of Jeruſalem, the reſtoration of the temple, the miſerable end of Antiochus, and the conſequent more full deliverance of the whole land. But after God once began to appear for the help of his church in that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, after it ſeemed dead and paſt all hope, he never ſuffered Antiochus to prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his people, to that degree, again; though the utmoſt ſtrength of this great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch was uſed, from time to time, in order to it, and his vaſt empire was engaged againſt an handful that oppoſed them: God never forſook the work of his own hands; when he had begun to deliver his people, he alſo made an end. And ſo Haman, that proud and inveterate enemy of the Jews, that tho't to extirpate the whole nation, who alſo was probably another type of Antichriſt, when he began to fall before Eſther and Mordecai, never ſtayed, until his ruin, and the church's deliverance was complete. Haman's wife
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:026594_0213_0FD0B38429746188"/>ſpeaks of it, as an argument of his approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inevitable full deſtruction, that he <hi>had begun to fall,</hi> Eſth. vi. 15.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If it ſhould be ſo, that anti-chriſtian tyranny and darkneſs ſhould hereafter ſo prevail againſt the Proteſtant church, and the true religion, and every thing appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, as to bring things to the paſs fore-mentioned, this would hardly ſo properly anſwer the prophecy of ſlaying the two wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes; for, doubtleſs, one reaſon why they are called two witneſſes is, that the number of the remaining witneſſes for the truth was, though ſufficient, yet very ſmall. Which was remarkably the caſe, in the dark times of Popery; but ſince the Reformation the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe appearing on the ſide of true religion, has been far from being ſo ſmall. —The viſible church of Chriſt has been vaſtly large, in compariſon of what it was before; the number of Proteſtants has ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times been thought nearly equal to that of the Papiſts; and, doubtleſs, the number of true ſaints has been far greater than before.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It ſeems to be ſignified in prophecy, that after the Reformation, Antichriſt ſhould never prevail againſt the church of Chriſt any more, as he had done before. I cannot
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:026594_0214_0FD0B385E3493400"/>but think, that whoever reads and well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders what the learned Mr. Lowman has written on the five firſt vials, Rev. xvi. in his late Expoſition on the Revelation, muſt think it to be very manifeſt, that what is ſaid, verſe 10, of the pouring out of the fifth vial <hi>on the throne of the beaſt,</hi> (for ſo it is in the original) is a prophecy of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Then the vial of God's wrath was poured out on the throne of the beaſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> according to the language of ſcripture, on his authority and dominion, greatly to weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and diminiſh it, both in extent and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. But when this is repreſented in the prophecy, then it is added, <hi>and his kingdom was full of darkneſs, and they gnawed their tongues for pain.</hi> If we conſider what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly intended by ſuch like phraſes in the ſcripture, I think we ſhall be naturally, and, as it were, neceſſarily led to underſtand thoſe words thus: Their policy, by which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore they have prevailed, ſhall now fail them; their authority ſhall be weakened, and their dominion greatly diminiſhed, and all their craft and ſubtilty ſhall not avail them to maintain and ſupport the throne of the beaſt, or even again to extend his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſo far as it had been before extended,

And, therefore, when the light fails, then may the kingdom of this ſpiritual Egypt be ſaid to be full of darkneſs. God hencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:026594_0216_0FD0B388A77ED318"/>will defend his people from theſe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Egyptians, as he defended Iſrael of old from Pharaoh and his hoſt, when pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing after them, by placing a cloud and darkneſs in their way, and ſo not ſuffering them to come nigh. So he will protect his church from the men of that city that is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually called Sodom, as Lot's houſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were the angels, was deſended from the men of Sodom, by their being ſmitten with darkneſs or blindneſs, ſo that they wearied themſelves to find the door; and as God defended the city in which was Eliſha the prophet, and witneſs of the Lord, from the Syrians, when they compaſſed it about with horſes and chariots, and a great hoſt to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend him, by ſmiting them with blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The ſcripture teaches us, that God is wont in this way to defend his church and people from their crafty and powerful ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, Job v. 11, &amp;c. <hi>To ſet up on high thoſe that be low, that thoſe which mourn may be exalted to ſafety: He diſappointeth the devices of the crafty, ſo that their hands cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their enterprize: He taketh the wiſe in their own craſtineſs, and the counſel of the forward is carried headlong: They meet with darkneſs in the day-time, and grope in the

                  </p>
                  <p>Upon the account of ſuch defence of God's Proteſtant church, and diſappointment and confuſion of all the ſubtle devices, deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid ſchemes, and furious attempts of their anti-chriſtian enemies, to bring them under, and root them out, and their ſeeing them ſtill maintaining their ground, and ſubſiſting in an independency on them in ſpi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Hitherto this prophecy has been very ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally fulfilled; ſince the Reformation, the kingdom of Antichriſt has been remarkably filled with darkneſs in this reſpect. Innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:026594_0218_0FD0B38BAE3062F8"/>have been the crafty devices, and great attempts of the church of Rome, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they have exerted their utmoſt policy and power, to recover their loſt dominions, and again to ſubjugate the Proteſtant nations, and ſubdue the northern hereſy, as they call it. They have wearied themſelves in theſe endeavours for more than two hundred years paſt; but have hitherto been diſappointed, and have often been ſtrangely confounded. When their matters ſeemed to be brought to a ripeneſs, and they triumphed as though their point was gained, their joy and triumph has ſuddenly turned into vexation and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. How many have been their politic and powerful attempts againſt the Proteſtant intereſt in our nation in particular? And how wonderfully has God diſappointed them from time to time! And as God has hitherto ſo remarkably fulfilled his word in defending his Proteſtant church from Antichriſt, ſo I think we have ground to truſt in him, that he will defend it to the end.</p>
                  <p n="5">5, The hypotheſis of thoſe who ſuppoſe the ſlaying of the witneſſes is a thing that yet remains to be fulfilled, makes the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies of the Revelation to be inconſiſtent

According to their hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis, that battle, Rev. xi. 7. wherein the beaſt makes war with the witneſſes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercomes them, and kills them, is the laſt and greateſt conflict between Antichriſt and the church of Chriſt, which is to precede the utter overthrow of the anti-chriſtian king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. And they muſt ſuppoſe ſo, for they ſuppoſe, that immediately after the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings the church ſhall endure in that war, ſhe ſhall ariſe, and, as it were, aſcend into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; <hi>i. e.</hi> as they interpret it, the church ſhall be directly advanced to her latter-day reſt, proſperity and glory. And conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this conflict muſt be the ſame with that great battle between Antichriſt and the Church, that is deſcribed, chap. xvi. 13. to the end, and more largely, chap. xix. 11. to the end. For that which is deſcribed in theſe places, is moſt evidently and indiſputably the greateſt and laſt battle or conflict that ſhall be between the church and her anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian enemies, on which the utter down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall of Antichriſt, and the church's advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to her latter-day glory, ſhall be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately conſequent. And ſo the earthquake that attends the reſurrection of the witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, chap. xi. 13. muſt be the ſame with that

                  <p>But theſe things cannot be. The battle. chap. xi. 7. cannot be the ſame with that laſt and great battle between the Church and Antichriſt, deſcribed, chap xvi. and xix.— For the things that are ſaid of one and the other, and their iſſue, are in no wiſe conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. In that battle, chap. xi. the church of God conflicts with her enemies in ſorrow, ſackcloth, and blood; but in the other the matter is repreſented exceedingly otherwiſe —the church goes forth to fight with Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, not in ſackcloth and blood, but cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in white raiment, Chriſt himſelf before them, as their captain, going forth in great pomp and magnificence, upon a <hi>white horſe,</hi> and <hi>on his head many crowns,</hi> and <hi>on his veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and on his thigh; a name written,</hi> KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS; and the ſaints who follow ſo glorious a leader to this great battle, follow him on <hi>white horſes, cloathed in fine linen, white and clean,</hi> in garments of ſtrength, joy, glory and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph; in the ſame kind of raiment, that the

And the iſſue of the latter of theſe conflicts, is quite the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe of the former. In the battle, chap. xi. 7. <hi>The beaſt makes war with the witneſſes, and</hi> OVERCOMES THEM, AND KILLS THEM; the ſame is foretold, Dan. vii. 21. <hi>I beheld, and the ſame horn made war with the ſaints, and prevailed againſt them.</hi>—And Rev. xii. 7. <hi>And it was given unto him to make war with the ſaints, and to overcome them.</hi> But in the iſſue of that laſt and great battle, which the church ſhall have with her anti-chriſtian e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, the church ſhall OVERCOME THEM, AND KILL THEM, Rev. xvii. 14. <hi>Theſe ſhall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb ſhall overcome them; for he is Lord of Lords, and King of Kings; and they that are with him, are called, and choſen, and faithful,</hi> compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with chapter xix. 16, and following verſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and chapter xvi. 16, 17. In the conflict that the beaſt ſhall have with the witneſſes, the <hi>beaſt kills them, and their dead bodies lie unburied;</hi> as though they were to be meat for the beaſts of the earth, and fowls of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; but in that laſt battle, it is repreſented that Chriſt and his church <hi>ſhall ſlay their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,

There is no manner of appearance, in the deſcriptions which are given of that laſt great battle, of any advantages gained in it, by the enemies of the church, before they themſelves are overcome, but all appearance of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.

<pb n="222" facs="unknown:026594_0223_0FD0B39327BE9368"/>that <hi>the remnant of their vaſt army are ſlain, and all the fowls filled with their fleſh.</hi> The iſſue of the conflict of the beaſt with the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, is the triumph of the church's ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies over God's people, looking on them as entirely vanquiſhed, and their intereſt ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ruined, paſt all poſſibility of recovery: <hi>They that dwell on the earth ſhall ſee the dead bodies of the ſaints lying in the ſtreets of the great city, and ſhall rejoice over them, and make merry, and ſend gifts one to another.</hi>— But the iſſue of that great and laſt battle is quite the reverſe; it is the church's triumph over her enemies, as being utterly and for over deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>Here, if any one ſhall ſay, that the aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the witneſſes into heaven in the ſight of their enemies, may, as has more general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been ſuppoſed, ſignify the church's laſt victory and triumph over her anti-chriſtian enemies, and final deliverance from them, and yet the battle between Antichriſt and the witneſſes, ſpoken of, Rev. xi. 7. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the witneſſes are ſlain, may not be the ſame with that laſt and greateſt battle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Antichriſt and the church, chap. xvi. and xix. which immediately precedes and iſſues in the church's final victory and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance;
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:026594_0224_0FD0B394A70E7578"/>there may be two great battles, ſoon following one another, though both are not mentioned in the ſame place; one a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, wherein Antichriſt prevails againſt the witneſſes, and overcomes them, and kills them, and another that great battle deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, chap. xvi. and xix. after the witneſſes reſurrection, before their aſcenſion into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, wherein they ſhall prevail and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their enemies, and kill them: I ſay, if any one ſhall ſay thus, they will ſay that which the prophecies give no reaſon, nor allow any room to ſuppoſe. That laſt battle between the Church and Antichriſt, wherein Chriſt and his people obtain a complete vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, is evidently one of the greateſt and moſt remarkable events foretold in all the Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypſe; and there is no one thing, unleſs it be the conſummation of all things, in the two laſt chapters, that is deſcribed in ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn and auguſt a manner. And the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription ſhews that it is an event which, with its circumſtances, muſt take up much time. There is vaſt preparation made for it by the church's enemies; the devils, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſtir men up, and gather them togeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to this <hi>battle of that great day of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighly, go forth unto the kings of the earth,
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:026594_0225_0FD0B39630879580"/>and of the whole world,</hi> to propagate various kinds of deluſions, far and wide, all over the world; which, undoubtedly, muſt take up many years time, chap xvi. 13, 14. And then great preparation is made in the church of God, to make oppoſition, chap. xix. 11 —17. Now can any reaſonably ſuppoſe, that in what is repreſented, chap. xi. of a great conflict between Antichriſt and God's people, wherein the latter are overcome and ſlain, and lie dead three days (or three years) and a half, and their enemies triumphing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, but God's people riſing again from the dead in the midſt of this triumph of their enemies, and aſcending into heaven, while the enemies ſtand aſtoniſhed and amazed ſpectators—that the manner of the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion leaves fair room for us to ſuppoſe, that after this reſurrection of God's people, they continue long before they aſcend, to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with Antichriſt in a new conflict, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their enemies, after long time to prepare, ſhould engage with them with vaſtly great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er preparations, ſtrength and violence than before, and ſhould wage war with the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt army that ever was gathered againſt the church, and in the greateſt battle that ever was fought.</p>

And beſides, the witneſſes aſcending into heaven in the ſight of their enemies, ſpoken of chap. xi. cannot be the ſame with the church's gaining a glorious aſcendant over her enemies, in her ſinal victory over Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, ſpoken of chap. xvi. and xix. becauſe the deſcriptions of the events that attend the one and the other do by no means anſwer each other. For, obſerve, it is ſaid, that when the witneſſes <hi>aroſe, and ſtood on their feet, and aſcended into heaven, the ſame hour there was a great earthquake;</hi> but this does not ſeem to anſwer to what is deſcribed, chap. xvi. 18. <hi>And there were voices, and thunders. and lightnings, and there was a great earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, ſuch as was not ſince men were upon the earth, ſo mighty an earthquake, and ſo great.</hi> —It is ſaid, that at the ſame time of the firſt earthquake, chap. xi. 13. <hi>The tenth part of the city fell;</hi> but how far does this fall ſhort of what is deſcribed, as attending the great earthquake? chap. xv. 19, 20. <hi>And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell; and great Babylon came into remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceneſs of his wrath; and every iſland fled away, and the

Which is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as a general ſlaughter of the kings, captains, mighty men, horſes, and armies of the earth, and of the whole world; ſo that all the fowls that fly in the midſt of heaven, as far as the ſun ſhines, are filled with the fleſh of the dead carcaſes, it being the <hi>fleſh of all men, both free and bond, both ſmall and great,</hi> (compare chap. xvi. 14.) who can think, that this great ſlaughter, that is thus repreſented, ſhould, in chap. xi. be only cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>ſlaying of ſeven thouſand men?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we read this very eleventh chapter thro', we ſhall ſee that the falling of the tenth part of the city, and the witneſſes riſing and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending into heaven, are entirely diſtinct from the final deſtruction of Antichriſt, and that advancement of the church to her lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-day glory, that is conſequent upon it.— The judgments here ſpoken of, as executed on God's enemies, are under another woe, and the benefits, beſtowed on the church, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And the ſeventh angel ſounded, and there were great voices in heaven, ſaying—The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chriſt, and he ſhall reign for ever and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi> And in the following verſes, we have an account of the praiſes ſung to God on this occaſion. And then in that laſt verſe, we have a brief hint of that ſame earthquake, and the great hail, and thoſe thunders, and lightnings, and voices, that we have an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of in the latter part of chap. xvi. So that the earthquake mentioned in the laſt verſe of chap. xi. is that great earthquake that attends the laſt great conflict of the church and her enemies, and not that men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned ver. 13.</p>
                  <p>The three woes are the woes of God on Antichriſt and his ſubjects; and the third and laſt of them evidently ſignifies the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible judgments of God on Antichriſt, by which Gods wrath upon him ſhall be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:026594_0229_0FD0B39C36F559E8"/>in his utter deſtruction; but the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities on Antichriſt, ſpoken of as attending the riſing and aſcending of the witneſſes, ſuch as the falling of the tenth part of the city, and ſlaying ſeven thouſand men, do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to this laſt woe, and therefore do not ſignify the final deſtruction of Antichriſt; for the words of verſe 14. will by no means allow of ſuch a ſuppoſition; for there, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after giving an account of theſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, it is added—<hi>The ſecond woe is paſt; and, behold, the third woe cometh quickly;</hi> making a moſt plain and expreſs diſtinction between theſe calamities that had already been mentioned, and eſpecially theſe that were juſt then mentioned in the very laſt words, and the calamities that belong to the third woe, that yet remain to be mentioned; for by being paſſed, the prophet is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood no otherwiſe than paſſed in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration and repreſentation—it was not paſt in any other reſpect; it is as much as to ſay, Thus an account has been given of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities upon Antichriſt that belong to the ſecond woe; now I proceed to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of thoſe diſpenſations of Providence <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>What was fulfilled in the Reformation, well anſwers the repreſentation made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the witneſſes, Rev xi. 11.12. <hi>Of the ſpirit of life from God entering into them, and their ſtanding on their feet, and aſcending up to heaven, in the ſight of their enemies.</hi> A lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before the Reformation, the ſtate of the church of God, and of true religion was low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of all, and neareſt to utter extinction.— Antichriſt had, after great and long ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, prevailed againſt the Waldenſes, Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſes, and Bohemians. The war with the Albigenſes ſeems eſpecially to be intended by the war of the beaſt with the witneſſes, ſpoken of verſe 7. Theſe were witneſſes to the truth that were the moſt numerous and conſiderable, and thoſe that moſt tormented the church of Rome. And the war that was maintained againſt them, was, by far, the greateſt that ever Antichriſt had againſt any of the profeſſors of the truth, before the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and was properly the war of the beaſt; it was the Pope that proclaimed the war, and that raiſed the ſoldiers by his emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries and prieſts, preaching the croſs, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering innumerable multitudes of pilgrims
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:026594_0231_0FD0B39FDD6417F8"/>from all parts of Chriſtendom, and raiſing one croiſade after another, which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted and managed by the Pope's legates; and it was the Pope that paid the ſoldiers with pardons, indulgences, promiſes of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, and ſuch like trumpery. When An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt had gradually prevailed againſt theſe witneſſes, with much difficulty, and long continued violent ſtruggling, and after in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable vexatious diſaſters and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments, the church of God, in the time of Luther, and other reformers, on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, in a wonderful manner, revives, when ſuch an event was leaſt expected, (to the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize and amazement of their anti-chriſtian enemies) and appears in ſuch ſtrength, that the reformed are able to ſtand on their own legs, and to withſtand all the power and rage of the church of Rome. Preſently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this revival, the people of God are ſet on high, having the civil magiſtrate in many countries on their ſide, and henceforward have the power of many potent princes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged for their protection. And this, in ſight of their enemies, and greatly to their grief and vexation; who, though they, from time to time, exert their utmoſt, never are able to prevail againſt them, to bring them
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:026594_0232_0FD0B3A0D36145F0"/>under any more, as they had done in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer wars. Oftentimes, in ſcripture, God's church's dwelling in ſafety, out of the reach of their enemies, is repreſented by their dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on high, or being ſet on high; as Pſal. lix. 1. lxix. 29. xci. 14. cvii. 41. Prov. xxix. 25. Iſai. xx xiii. 16. The children of Iſrael, in their deliverance out of Egypt, from their cruel taſk-maſters, who would fain have brought them into bondage again, were ſaid <hi>to be carried on eagle's wings,</hi> which is lofty in its flight, flies away towards hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſo that the Egyptians could not come at them; and they were protected by the cloud that went with them, as the witneſſes are ſaid to be caught up to heaven in a cloud. Compare this with Iſai. iv. 5. <hi>And the Lord will create upon every dwelling-place of Mount Zion, and upon her aſſemblies, a cloud and ſmoke by day, and the ſhining of a flaming fire by night; for upon all the glory ſhall be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</hi>

                  <p>I ſhall not pretend to explain the myſtery of the three days and a half of the witneſſes lying dead, or to determine the preciſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſignified by that myſtical repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

                        </gap> in a figurate meaning, as ſymbols and hieroglyphics. Thus the number <hi>SEVEN</hi> ſometimes does not denote the preciſe number ſeven; but figurative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denotes perfection, or a full and complete number; and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ten ſometimes does not mean preciſely ten in number, but many in general, or a conſiderable number.</note> As no particular number of perſons is intended by the two wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, but, in general, it intends a ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and yet a ſufficient number; and as ſmall as might be, and yet be ſufficient; as leſs than two witneſſes was not ſufficient, ſo, perhaps, no particular duration of that low ſtate that the church was in before the Reformation, may be intended by three days and an half, but, in general, it may be hereby ſignified, that this time of the triumphing of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and extremity of God's church, ſhould be but ſhort. Poſſibly three days and an half may be mentioned, becauſe that is the utmoſt ſpace of time that a dead body can be ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily ſuppoſed to lie without putrefaction, ſignifying that at this time the church ſhould be brought to the very brink of utter ruin, and yet ſhould be preſerved, and revive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. And half a day may be mentioned to
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:026594_0234_0FD0B3A3A6DCCE88"/>ſignify the particular care of Providence in exactly determining this time of his church's extremity. And probably there may be ſome reference to the three times (or three years) and an half of the witneſſes propheſying in ſackcloth: the more apparently to ſhew the diſproportion between the time of the church's welfare, and the time of her enemies victory and triumph; the time of the church's af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction and conflict may be long, and in the iſſue ſhe may be overcome; but the time of this victory ſhall be but ſhort, in compariſon with the other, but as a day to a year; ſhe may, as it were, be killed, and lie dead, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til she comes to the very brink of utter and hopeleſs ruin, but yet God will not ſuffer her to ſee corruption; but at that very time, when her enemies expected that ſhe ſhould putrify, ſhe ſhall riſe, and be ſet on high, out of their reach, greatly to their aſtoniſhment.</p>
                  <p>The grand objection againſt all this is, that it is ſaid, that <hi>the witneſſes ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy twelve hundred and ſixty days cloathed in ſackcloth; and when they have finiſhed their teſtimony, the beaſt ſhould make war againſt them, and kill them,</hi> &amp;c. and that it ſeems ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that after this, they are no longer in
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:026594_0235_0FD0B3A533E08868"/>ſackcloth, for henceforward they are in an exalted ſtate in heaven; and that, therefore, ſeeing the time of their wearing ſackcloth is twelve hundred and fifty days, which is the time of the continuance of Antichriſt; hence their being ſlain and riſing again, muſt be at the concluſion of this period, and ſo at the end of Antichriſt's reign.</p>
                  <p>In anſwer to which I would ſay, that we can juſtly infer no more from this prophecy than this, viz. That the twelve hundred and ſixty days is the proper time of the church's trouble and bondage, or being cloathed in ſackcloth, becauſe it is the appointed time of the reign of Antichriſt. But this does not hinder but that God, out of his great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion to his church, ſhould, in ſome reſpect, ſhorten the days, and grant that ſhe ſhould, in ſome meaſure, anticipate the appointed great deliverance that ſhould be at the end of thoſe days; as he has, in fact, done in the Reſormation, whereby the church has had a great degree of reſtoration granted, from the darkneſs and power of Antichriſt, before her proper time of reſtoration, which is at the end of the twelve hundred and ſixty days. Thus the church of Chriſt, through the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mercies of her Father and Redeemer, in
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:026594_0236_0FD0B3A6A77A0888"/>ſome reſpects, anticipates her deliverance from her ſorrows and ſackcloth; as many parts of the church are hereby brought from under the dominion of the anti-chriſtian pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, into a ſtate of power and liberty, though, in other reſpects, the church may be ſaid to continue in ſackcloth, and in the wilderneſs, until the end of the days; many parts of it ſtill remaining under grievous perſecution.</p>

                  <p>I might here obſerve, that we have other inſtances of God's ſhortening the days of his church's captivity and bondage, either at the beginning or end, very parallel with what has been now ſuppoſed in the caſe of the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. Thus the proper time of the bondage of the poſterity of Abraham in Egypt, was four hundred years, Gen. xv. 13. But yet God in mercy deferred the beginning of their bondage, whereby the time was much ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened at the beginning. So the time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> was foretold, that the <hi>whole land of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:026594_0237_0FD0B3A827E034C8"/>ſhould be a deſolation and an aſtoniſhment, and the land ſhould enjoy her ſabbaths,</hi> by the Babyloniſh captivity, was ſeventy years, Jer. xxv. 11, 12. and theſe ſeventy years are dat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in 2d Chro. xxxvi. 20, 21. from Zede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah's captivity; and yet, from that captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Cyrus's decree, was but fifty-two years; though it was indeed ſeventy years before the more full reſtoration of the Jewiſh church and ſlate by Darius's decree, Ezra vi. So the proper time of the oppreſſion and bondage of the Jewiſh church under Antiochus Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes, wherein <hi>both the ſanctuary and hoſt ſhould be trodden under foot by him, was two thouſand three hundred days,</hi> Dan. viii. 13, 14. The time from Antiochus's taking Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, and polluting the ſanctuary, to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus's death, ſeems to have been about ſo long; but God ſhortened the days, by grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing remarkable help to his people by means of the Maccabees, before that time; yea, the temple and ſanctuary were reſlored, and the altar rebuilt and dedicated before that time.</p>
                  <p>Upon the whole, I think there appears to be no reaſon from the prophecy concerning the two witneſſes, Rev. xi. to expect any ſuch general and terrible deſtruction of the church of Chriſt, before the utter downfal of
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:026594_0238_0FD0B3A9B7F3EDC8"/>Antichriſt, as ſome have ſuppoſed, but good reaſon to determine the contrary. It is true, there is abundant evidence in ſcripture, that there is yet remaining a mighty conflict be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the church and her enemies, the moſt violent ſtruggle of Satan and his adherents, in oppoſition to true religion, and the moſt general commotion that ever was in the world, ſince the foundation of it to that time; and many particular Chriſtians, and ſome parts of the church of Chriſt, may ſuffer hard things in this conflict; but, in the general, Satan and Antichriſt ſhall not get the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, nor greatly prevail, but, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, be entirely conquered, and utterly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown, in this great battle. So that I hope this prophecy of the ſlaying of the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes will not ſtand in the way of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the propoſal made to us in the memorial, as a prevalent objection and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement.</p>

If this objection be allowed to be valid, and that which ought to determine perſons in an affair of this nature, and thoſe things concerning God's people praying for this glorious event, be alſo allowed to be true, which before were ſhewn to be the will of God abundantly revealed in his word, then the following things muſt be ſuppoſed, viz. That it is the will of God that his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be much in prayer for this event, and particularly that it is God's revealed will and purpoſe, that, a little before the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of it, his people be earneſtly ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and waiting, and importunately and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly crying to God for it; but yet that it was God's deſign, that before this time comes of extraordinary prayer and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of his church, for the bringing on this glorious event, his church ſhould have it giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en them to underſtand preciſely when the appointed time ſhould be, and that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly he has now actually brought the fixed time to light by means of Mr. Lowman.—
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:026594_0240_0FD0B3ACB80C9E18"/>But is it reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that this ſhould be God's manner of dealing with his church, firſt to make known to them the preciſe time which he has unalterably ſixed for the ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this mercy to Zion, and then make it the duty of his church, in an extraordinary manner, to be, by prayer, enquiring of him concerning it, and ſaying—<hi>How long, Lord!</hi> and waiting for it, day and night, crying to him, with exceeding importunity, that he would bring it on, that he would come quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he would hide himſelf no longer, but would ariſe and have mercy upon Zion, and awake as one out of ſleep, openly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſeſt himſelf, and make bare his holy arm for the ſalvation of his people? That <hi>they that make mention of the Lord ſhould not keep ſilence, nor give him any reſt, until he eſtabliſh and make Jeruſalem a praiſe on the earth?</hi> And that the church ſhould then ſay to Chriſt, <hi>Make haſte, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart on the mountain of ſpices?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may be many ways for the comfort and beneſit of God's church in her afflicted ſtate, to know that the reign of Antichriſt is to be no more than one thouſand two hundred and ſixty years; and ſome things in general
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:026594_0241_0FD0B3AE27AC4FA0"/>may be argued concerning the approach of it, when it is near; as the Jews could argue the approach of Chriſt's firſt coming, from Daniel's prophecy of the ſeventy weeks, though they knew not preciſely when that ſeventy weeks would end. But it is not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to expect that God ſhould make known to us beforehand, the preciſe time of Chriſt's coming in his kingdom. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples deſired to know this, and manifeſted their deſire to their Lord, but he told them plainly, that <hi>it was not for them to know the times and ſeaſons, which the Father hath put in his own power,</hi> Acts i. 6, 7. and there is no reaſon to think that it is any more for us than for them, or for Chriſt's diſciples in theſe days, any more than for his apoſtles in thoſe days. God makes it the duty of his church to be importunately praying for it, and praying that it may come ſpeedily; and not only to be praying for it, but to be ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for it, in the uſe of proper means, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring that religion may now revive e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where, and Satan's kingdom be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown; and always to be waiting for it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a conſtant preparation for it, as ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants that wait for the coming of their lord, or virgins for the coming of the bridegroom,
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:026594_0242_0FD0B3AFA87354D8"/>not knowing at what hour he will come.— But God's making known beforehand the preciſe time of his coming, does not well conſiſt with theſe things.</p>
                  <p>It is the revealed will of God, that he ſhould be enquired of by his people, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary prayer, concerning this great mercy, to do it for them, before it be fulfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And if any ſuppoſe, that it is now found out preciſely when the time is to be, and (the time being at a conſiderable diſtance) that now is not a proper ſeaſon to begin this extraordinary prayer, I would, on this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, aſk—When we ſhall begin? How long before the fixed and known time of the beſtowment of this mercy comes, ſhall we begin to cry earneſtly to God that this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> come, and that Chriſt would make haſte and be like a roe, &amp;c. For us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, ſuppoſing that we know the time to be ſar off, is not agreeable to the language of God's people in my text—<hi>Come, let us go</hi> SPEEDILY, <hi>and pray before the Lord, and ſeek the Lord of Hoſts.</hi>

<pb n="242" facs="unknown:026594_0243_0FD0B3B134226B98"/>into ſome parts of that prophecy, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the fulſillment of that prediction, Dan. xii. 4. <hi>Many ſhall run to and fro, and knowledge ſhall be increaſed;</hi> and eſpecially in his Interpretation of the Five Firſt Vials, (which he ſuppoſeth already poured out) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly ſatisfying. But yet the opinion of Mr. Lowman, with regard to the particular time of the beginning and end of the time, times, and an half of Antichriſt's reign, and of all others that pretend to ſix the time, is the leaſt to be regarded, becauſe it is clearly revealed, and expreſsly declared by God, that that matter ſhall be ſealed up and hid, and not known until the time of the end of this time, times, and an half. Daniel, in the laſt chapter of his prophecy, gives us an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, how the angel told him of a future time of great trouble and affliction to the church of God, and then ſaid to him, ver. 4. <hi>But thou, O Daniel,</hi> SHUT UP THE WORDS, AND SEAL THE BOOK, EVEN TO THE TIME OF THE END. And then the prophet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to give an account of a viſion that he had of one earneſlly enquiring of the angel of the Lord <hi>how long it would be to the end</hi> of this remarkable and wonderful time of the church's trouble, ſaying. <hi>How long ſhall

The anſwer was, that <hi>it ſhould be for a time, times, and an half,</hi> and that when ſo long a time was paſt, then this wonderful affliction and ſcattering of the holy people ſhould be finiſhed, ver. 7. But then Daniel tells us, in the next verſe, that <hi>he heard, but he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>O, my Lord, what ſhall be the end of theſe things?</hi> He did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that general and myſtical anſwer, that thoſe things ſhould have an end at the end of a time, times, and an half; he did not know by it, when this period would have an end; and therefore he enquires more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly what the time of the end was. But the angel replies, ver. 9. <hi>Go thy way, Daniel, the words are cloſed and ſealed up, until the time of the end.</hi> I do not know what could have been more expreſs. The angel gently rebukes this over inquiſitiveneſs of Daniel, very much as Chriſt did a like inquiſitiveneſs of the diſciples concerning the ſame matter, when he ſaid to them—<hi>It is not for you to know the times and ſeaſons, that the Father hath put in his own power.</hi>—I think there can be no doubt but that this ſpace, of a time, times, and an half of the church's great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, about the end of which Daniel enquires,
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:026594_0245_0FD0B3B425987B30"/>is the ſame with that time, times, and half, that is ſpoken of, chap. vii. 25. and Rev. xii. 14. as the time of Antichriſt's reign, and the church's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>n the wilderneſs, and not merely the time of the church's troubles by Antiochus Epiphanes. But we ſee, when Daniel has a mind to know particularly when this time would come to an end, he is bid to go away, and reſt contented in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of this matter; for, ſays the man cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in linen, THE WORDS ARE CLOSED UP, AND SEALED, UNTIL THE TIME OF THE END. That is, very plainly, the matter that you enquire about, when the end of this time, and times, and half ſhall come, ſhall not be known, but be kept a great ſecret, until the time of the end actually comes, and all attempts to find it out before that ſhall be in vain. And therefore when a particular divine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that thinks he has found it out, and has unſealed this matter, and made it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt with very manifold and abundant e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, we may well think he is miſtaken, and doubt whether thoſe ſuppoſed eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are truly ſolid ones, and ſuch as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſufficient to make that matter manifeſt, which God has declared ſhould be kept hid, and not made manifeſt before it is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed.
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:026594_0246_0FD0B3B5B130F0F8"/>Mr. Lowman's own words in his preface, p. 24, 25. are here worthy to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated: <q>It will (ſays he) ever be a point of wiſdom, not to be over buſy, or over confident in any thing, eſpecially in fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing periods of time, or determining ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which it may be are not to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, it may be are not fit to be known. It is a maxim, of greater wiſdom than is uſually thought, <hi>Seek not to know what ſhould not be revealed.</hi> Such are many future events. The preciſe time of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's coming to judgment, was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, becauſe not fit to be revealed.— The uncertainty of his appearance was of greater ſervice to preſerve a care of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, than the revelation of it would have been; for the uncertainty itſelf gives many uſeful exhortations—<hi>Watch, for ye know not what hour the Son of Man cometh.</hi> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe then ſome of the events deſcribed in this prophecy ſhould be of doubtful ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication; ſuppoſe the preciſe time of the downfall of the beaſt, the ſlaying and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the witneſſes, and the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the thouſand years happy ſtate of the church, ſhould not be ſo determined, but it would admit of different calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:026594_0247_0FD0B3B72596C5B0"/>may it not be wiſe, and therefore fit, it ſhould be ſo? The certainty of thoſe events in a proper time, though that time ſhould not be preciſely determined, will anſwer the greater ends of uſeful inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And if the revelation ſhould go no farther than this, it would yet be a revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of great benefit and advantage, as the certainty of the day of judgment in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per time ſurely is, though of that day and hour knoweth no man.</q>

Though it is not for us to know the preciſe time of the fall of Antichriſt, yet I humbly conceive that we have no reaſon to ſuppoſe the event principally intended, in the prophecies, of Antichriſt's deſtruction, to be at ſo great a diſtance, as Mr. Lowman places it, but have reaſon to think it to be much nearer. Not that I would ſet up my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as a perſon of equal judgment with Mr. Lowman in matters of this nature. As he differs from moſt others of the moſt approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed expoſitors of the Apocalypſe, in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſo I hope it will not appear vanity and preſumption in me, to differ from this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular expoſitor, and to agree with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er number. And ſince his opinion ſtands ſo much in the, way of that great and import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:026594_0248_0FD0B3B8B40E3F88"/>affair, to promote which is the very end of this whole diſcourſe, I hope it will not look as though I affected to appear conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably among the interpreters of prophecy, and as a perſon of ſkill in theſe myſterious matters, that I offer ſome reaſons againſt Mr. Lowman's opinions. It is ſurely a great pity, that it ſhould be received as a thing clear and abundantly confirmed, that the glorious day of Antichriſt's fall is at ſo great a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, (ſo directly tending to damp and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage all earneſt prayers for, or endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours after its ſpeedy accompliſhment) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs there be good and plain ground for it. I would therefore offer ſome things to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, which, I think, may juſtly make us look upon the opinion of this learned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter, of this happy event's being at ſo great a diſtance, not ſo certain and indubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, as to hinder our praying and hoping for its being fulfilled much ſooner.</p>
                  <p>The period of Antichriſt's reign, as this author has ſixed it, ſeems to be the main point inſiſted on in his Expoſition of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, which he ſuppoſes a great many things in the ſcheme of prophecies deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that book do concur to eſtabliſh. And, indeed, it is ſo, with reſpect to the ſcheme
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:026594_0249_0FD0B3BA35820750"/>of interpretation of theſe prophecies, which he goes into, and finds it requiſite to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, in order to confirm this point. But there are ſeveral things in that ſcheme, that appear to me juſtly liable to exception.</p>
                  <p>Whereas it is repreſented, Rev. xvii. 10, 11. that there are ſeven different ſucceſſive heads of the beaſt; that five were paſt, and another was to come, and to continue a ſhort ſpace, that might, on ſome accounts, be reckoned a ſeventh; and that Antichriſt was to follow next after this, as the eighth; but yet the foregoing not being properly one of the heads of the beaſt, he was properly the ſeventh. Mr. Lowman does not think with others, that by the ſeventh that was to continue a ſhort ſpace, which would not be properly one of the heads of the beaſt, is meant Conſtantine, and the other Chriſtian emperors; (for he thinks they are reckoned as properly belonging to the ſixth head of the beaſt) but that hereby is intended the government that Rome was ſubject to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Gothic princes, and the exarchate of Ravenna, after the imperial form of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in Rome ceaſed in Auguſtulus, until the Pope was inveſted with his tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral dominion, called St. Peter's Patrimony,

And he ſuppoſes, that that wounding of one of the heads of the beaſt with a ſword of death, that we read of, chap. xiii. 3 and 14. was not fulfilled in the deſtruction of the heathen empire, and the giving the imperial power unto Chriſtians, but in the deſtruction of the imperial form of government, by the ſword of the Goths, in the time of Auguſtulus. But it ſeems to me to be very unlikely, that the Spirit of God ſhould reckon Conſtantime and the Chriſtian emperors as proper members, and belonging to one of the heads, of that mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous wild and cruel beaſt, that is compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a leopard and a bear, and a devouring lion, and that had a mouth ſpeaking great things and blaſphemies, and that rules by the power and authority of the dragon, or the devil;<note n="*" place="bottom">The word <hi>Therion</hi> ſigniſies a wild ſavage beaſt, as Mr. Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

For Conſtantine, inſtead of
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:026594_0251_0FD0B3BD3589A870"/>this was a member of the Chriſtian church, and ſet by God in the moſt eminent ſtation in his church, and was honoured above all other princes that ever had been in the world. as the great protector of his church, and her deliverer from the perſecuting power of that cruel ſcarlet-coloured beaſt. Mr. Lowman himſelf ſtyles him <hi>a Chriſtian Prince, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector of the Chriſtian Religion.</hi> God is very careful not to reckon his own people among the Gentiles, the viſible ſubjects of Satan, Num. xxiii. 9. <hi>The people ſhall not be reckoned among the nations.</hi> God will not enroll them with them; if they happen to be among them, he will be careful to ſet a mark upon them, as a note of diſtinction, Rev. vii. 3, &amp;c. when God is reckoning up his own people, he leaves out thoſe that have been noted for idolatry. As among the tribes that were ſealed, Rev. viii. thoſe idolatrous tribes of Ephraim and Dan are left out, and in the genealogy of Chriſt, Matth. i. thoſe princes that were chiefly noted for idolatry, are left out. Much more would God be careful not to reckon his own people, eſpecially ſuch Chriſtian princes as have been the moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent inſtruments of overthrowing idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, amongſt idolaters, and as members and
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:026594_0252_0FD0B3BEA64ABC00"/>heads of that kingdom that is noted in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as the moſt notorious and infamous of all, for abominable idolatry, and oppoſition and cruelty to the true worſhippers of God. And eſpecially not to reckon them as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belonging to one of thoſe ſeven heads of this monarchy, of which very heads it is particularly noted that they had on them the names of BLASPHEMY, which Mr. Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man himſelf ſuppoſes to ſignify idolatry. It was therefore worthy of God, agreeable to his manner, and what might well be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that when he was reckoning up the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſucceſſive heads of this beaſt, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine and his ſucceſſors came in the way, and there was occaſion to mention them, to ſet a mark, or note of diſtinction on them, ſignifying that they did not properly belong to the beaſt, nor were to be reckoned as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the heads, and therefore are to be ſkipped over in the reckoning, and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, though the eighth head of the Roman empire, is to be reckoned the ſeventh head of the beaſt. This appears to me abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the moſt juſt and natural interpretation of Rev. xvii. 10, 11. It is reaſonable to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that God would take care to make ſuch a note in this prophetical deſcription
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:026594_0253_0FD0B3C0256FB1C8"/>of this dreadful beaſt, and not, by any means to reckon Conſtantine as belonging properly to him.—If we reckon Conſtantine as a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of this beaſt having ſeven heads and ten horns, deſcribed chap. xvii. and as properly one of his heads, then he was alſo properly a member of the great red dragon with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven heads and ten horns that warred with the woman, chap. xii. For the ſeven heads and ten borns of that dragon, are plainly the ſame with the ſeven heads and ten horns of the beaſt. So that this makes Conſtantine a viſible member of the devil; for we are told expreſsly of that dragon, ver 9. that he was <hi>that old ſerpent, called the Devil and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.</hi> And to ſuppoſe that Conſtantine is reckoned as belonging to one of the heads of that dragon, is to make theſe prophecies inconſiſtent with themſelves. For herein this 12th chapter, we have repreſented a war be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the dragon and the woman cloathed with the ſun; which woman, as all agree, is the church; but Conſtantine, as all do alſo agree, belonged to the woman, was a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Chriſtian church, and was on that ſide in the war againſt the dragon; yea, was the main inſtrument of that great victory that was obtained over the dragon there ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:026594_0254_0FD0B3C1A567B2E8"/>of, ver. 9—12. What an inconſiſtency therefore is it, to ſuppoſe that he was at the ſame time a member and head of that very dragon, which fought with the woman, and yet which Conſtantine himſelf fought with, overcame, and gloriouſly triumphed over! It is not therefore to be wondered at, that God was careful to diſtinguiſh Conſtantine from the proper heads of the beaſt; it would have been a wonder if he had not. God ſeems to have been careful to diſtinguiſh him, not only in his word, but in his providence, by ſo ordering it that this Chriſtian emperor ſhould be removed from Rome, the city that God had given up to be the ſeat of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the beaſt, and of its heads, and that he ſhould have the ſeat of his empire elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>
                  <p>Conſtantine was made the inſtrument of giving a mortal wound to the heathen Roman empire, and giving it a mortal wound in its head, viz. the heathen emperors that were then reigning, Maxentius and Licinius.— But more eminently was this glorious change in the empire owing to the power of God's word, the prevalence of the glorious goſpel, by which Conſtantine himſelf was convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo became the inſtrument of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:026594_0255_0FD0B3C327113C68"/>of the heathen empire in the eaſt and weſt. The change that was then bro't to paſs, is repreſented as the deſtruction of the heathen empire, or the old heathen world, and therefore ſeems to be compared to that diſſolution of heaven and earth that ſhall be at the day of judgment, Rev. vi. 12. to the end. And therefore well might the heathen empire, under the head which was then reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, be repreſented as wounded to death, chap. xiii. 3. It is much more likely, that the wound the beaſt had by a ſword, in his head, ſpoken of ver. 14. was the wound that the heathen empire had in its head, by that ſword which we read of, chap. i. 16. and xix. 15. that proceeds out of the mouth of Chriſt, than the wound that was given to the Chriſtian empire and emperor by the ſword of the heathen Goths. It is moſt likely that this deadly wound was by that ſword with which Michael made war with him, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercame him, and caſt him to the earth, chap. xii. 9. and that the deadly wound which was given him, was given him at that very time. It is moſt likely, that the ſword that gave him this deadly wound, after which he ſtrangely revived as though he roſe from the dead, was the ſame ſword with that which is ſpoken of,
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:026594_0256_0FD0B3C4D53E2410"/>as what ſhall at laſt utterly deſtroy him, ſo that he ſhall never riſe more, chap. xix. 15, 19, 20, 21. This wounding of the head of the beaſt by the deſtruction of the heathen em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and converſion of the emperor to the Chriſtian truth, was a glorious event indeed of Divine Providence, worthy to be ſo much ſpoken of in prophecy. It is natural to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that the mortal wounding of the head of that ſavage cruel beaſt, that is repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as conſtantly at war with the woman, and perſecuting the church of Chriſt, ſhould be ſome relief to the Chriſtian church; but, on the contrary, that wounding to death, that Mr. Lowman ſpeaks of, was the victory of the enemies of the Chriſtian church over her, and the wound received from them.</p>
                  <p>It is ſaid of that head of the empire that ſhall be next after the ſixth head, and next before Antichriſt, and that is not reckoned as properly one of the number of the heads of the beaſt, that <hi>when it comes, it ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a ſhort ſpace,</hi> chap. xvii. 10. By which we may underſtand, at leaſt, that it ſhall be one of the ſhorteſt, in its continuance, of the ſucceſſive heads. But the government ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Ravenna, in the hands of the Goths, or of the deputies of the Greek emperors,
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:026594_0257_0FD0B3C68BEFD8E0"/>(which Mr. Lowman ſuppoſes to be meant by the head) continued, as Mr. Lowman himſelf takes notice, very near three hundred years. And if ſo, its continuance was one of the longeſt of the heads mentioned.</p>
                  <p>And beſides, if the government that Rome was under, from the time that Auguſtulus abdicated, to the time when the Pope was confirmed in his temporal dominion, was meant by the ſeventh head that was to be between the imperial head and the papal, there would doubtleſs have been two differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent heads mentioned, inſtead of one, between the Emperor and the Pope, viz. Firſt, the Gothic princes, which reigned near an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years. Secondly, the Exarchs of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venna, which governed for about one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and eighty-five years. The Gothic kingdom was much more properly a diſtinct government from the Imperial, than the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archate of Ravenna; for during the Exar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chate, Rome was under the government of the emperor, as much as it was in Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine's time.</p>
                  <p>In Rev. xvii. 12. it is ſaid, the <hi>ten horns are ten kings, which are to receive power as kings one hour with the beaſt,</hi> or (as Mr. Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſays, it ought to have been tranſlated)
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:026594_0258_0FD0B3C7A92157B8"/>
                     <hi>the ſame hour,</hi> or <hi>point of time with the beaſt.</hi> This will not allow the time when Antichriſt firſt receives power as king, to be ſo late as Mr. Lowman ſuppoſes. This diviſion of the empire into many kingdoms, denoted by the number ten, was about the year four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty-ſix, after Genſericus had tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the city of Rome; but Mr. Lowman pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the beginning of the reign of Antichriſt in the year ſeven hundred and fifty-ſix, which is three hundred years later. I know, ſuch an expreſſion as <hi>in one hour,</hi> or <hi>the ſame hour,</hi> may allow ſome latitude, but ſurely not ſuch a latitude as this. This is a much longer time, than it was from the time of the viſion to Conſtantine: much longer than the ſpace of all the firſt ſix ſeals, longer than it was from Chriſt's aſcenſion to Conſtantine, and near as long as the time of all the reigns of the heathen emperors put together, from Auguſtus Caefar to Conſtantine. An hour is every where, in the other places in this book of Revelation, uſed to ſignify a very ſhort time, as may be ſeen in places cited in the margin.<note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. xviii. 10, 17, 19.

                  <p>Mr. Lowman greatly inſiſts upon it, that what is ſpoken as continuing one thouſand two hundred and ſixty days, is not ſo much and ſpiritual authority or eccleſiaſtical pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Pope, over the nations of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as his temporal government and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in that individual city of Rome, and therefore to determine when theſe one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand two hundred and ſixty days or years began, and when they will end, we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider when the Pope firſt received this his temporal power over the city of Rome, and the neighbouring regions, called St. Peter's Patrimony. But I can ſee no good reaſon for this. Indeed it is ſtrange, if it be ſo.—God has been pleaſed in theſe revelations
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:026594_0260_0FD0B3CB08BE8298"/>and prophecies, which he has given for the benefit of his church in general, to ſpeak much concerning an anti-chriſtian power that ſhould ariſe, that ſhould <hi>perſecute the ſaints, and ſcatter the power of the holy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> and be an occaſion of great affliction to the church of Chriſt; and in theſe revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in both Old Teſtament and New, has declared, and often repeated it, that his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion ſhall continue ſo long, and no longer; and for the comfort of his church in general, Chriſt hath-ſworn with great ſolemnity, that the continuance of this perſecuting power ſhall be limited, Dan. xii. 7. Now it would be ſtrange if, in all this, the thing principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intended is not that dominion of this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-chriſtian power which chiefly concerns the church of Chriſt in general, but merely his temporal dominion over one movince in I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly, called St. Peter's Patrimony. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, that dominion of Antichriſt, which the prophecies inſiſt upon and deſcribe, is the dominion whoſe duration and limits thoſe prophecies declare. But the dominion of Antichriſt which the prophecies inſiſt upon and deſcribe, is not any dominion over a particular province in Italy, but the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion by which he ſucceeds the four great
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:026594_0261_0FD0B3CC262D8B58"/>
                     <hi>monarchies of the world,</hi> Dan. vii. The do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion by which he <hi>ſucceeds the dragon in his power, throne and great authority,</hi> Rev. xiii. 2. The dominion in which he has <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er given him over all kindreds, tongues and nations,</hi> ver. 7. The dominion by which <hi>the great whore ſits on many waters,</hi> chap. xvii. 1. which the angel explains to be <hi>peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues,</hi> ver. 15. and the dominion in which he <hi>reigns over the ten kings,</hi> into which the Roman empire is divided, Rev. xiii. 1. and xviii. 3.12, 13. The beaſt that had ten horns, is not the city of Rome, and the neighbouring re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but the Roman empire; they are the horns or the kings, not of the city, but of the empire. If we conſider what is expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the paſſages themſelves, which ſpeak of the three years and an half of Antichriſt, they will lead us to underſtand ſomething very diverſe from the duration of his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral dominion over St. Peter's Patrimony. In Dan vii. 25. the time, times, and half of the little horn, is expreſsly the continvance of time, wherein <hi>it ſhall be given to him to change times and laws, and wear out the ſaints of the Moſt High;</hi> and in chap. xii. 7. it is ſpoken of as <hi>the time of his ſcattering the
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:026594_0262_0FD0B3CDA8284600"/>power of the holy people;</hi> in Rev. xi. 2. the forty and two months is ſpoken of as the time of Antichriſt's <hi>treading under foot the court of the temple and the holy city;</hi> i. e. the external and viſible Chriſtian church abroad in the world, or the nations of Chriſtendom. In ver. 3. the one thouſand two hundred and ſixty days of Antichriſt are ſpoken of as the time of the <hi>witneſſes propheſying in ſackcloth;</hi> and in chap. xii. 6. and 14. the time of the <hi>woman's being in the wilderneſs,</hi> which was through the great power that Antichriſt had over the Chriſtian world, and not his ſmall temporal dominion in Italy.</p>
                  <p>It is true, ſome regard is had in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies to the city of Rome, the city built on ſeven hills; which being the fountain of all rule and authority in the Roman monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, and the capital city in the empire, from whence the whole empire was denominated, and the place where the head of the empire uſually reſided, was properly made uſe of by the angel, Rev. xvii. 9, 18. to ſhew what empire Antichriſt ſhould rule over, and what city he ſhould uſually reſide in. And this is all that can be meant by the words of the angel; and not that thoſe ſtreets and walls, and the very ground, were ſuch main and
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:026594_0263_0FD0B3CF26F5ADB8"/>eſſential things in what the prophecy intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the beaſt; that when Antichriſt's do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion ceaſes in that place, then the beaſt ceaſes. For, if ſo, then it will ſollow, that the beaſt had his head wounded to death a ſecond time, and ceaſed to be, when the Popes reſided at Avignon in France, for the beſt part of a century; when not only the Popes did not reſide in Rome, nor in any part of St. Peter's Patrimony, nor any part of Italy, but ſome of them were neither Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans nor Italians. Though the angel ſays of the great whore, Rev. xvii. 18. <hi>The wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man which thou ſaweſt, is the great city which reigns over the kings of the earth;</hi> yet by the city, in this caſe, is not meant ſo much what was contained within thoſe Roman walls, as the Roman empire, as is evident by chap. xi. 8. <hi>And their dead bodies ſhall lie in the ſtreet of the great city, which is ſpiritually call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sodom and Egypt.</hi> Here, by that great city, neither Mr. Lowman himſelf, nor, I ſuppoſe, any other Proteſtant interpreter, underſtands the city of Rome, ſtrictly ſpeaking, but the Roman monarchy.</p>
                  <p>And though it be true, as Mr. Lowman obſerves, the Pope's eccleſiaſtical monarchy, and power and influence through Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:026594_0264_0FD0B3D0A6DA03B0"/>was greatly eſtabliſhed and advanced by Pepin's making him a temporal prince over the Exarchate of Ravenna; yet, I would aſk, whether the Pope's power and influence in the world, and his ability to diſturb the quiet of the nations of Chriſtendom, and (as it is expreſſed in Daniel) <hi>to change times and laws,</hi> and to carry his own deſigns, in the various countries and kingdoms of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, was not greater before Pepin, than it is now, and has been for a long time? And yet Mr. Lowman ſuppoſes that now is properly the time of Antichriſt's reign, that the one thouſand two hundred and ſixty years of his reign continues, and will continue for about two hundred and ſeventy years longer; tho' his power be now ſo ſmall, and has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining ever ſince the reformation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nd ſtill declines continually.</p>
                  <p>One thing that Mr. Lowman ſuppoſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms his opinion of ſo late a beginning of the one thouſand two hundred and ſixty years of the reign of the beaſt, is the order of the ſeveral periods of this prophecy, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their ſucceeding one another.</p>
                  <p>As to his particular ſcheme of the ſeven periods, ſo divided and limited, and ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly ranked in ſuch order, and following
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:026594_0265_0FD0B3D24670A6B0"/>one another in ſuch direct and continual ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, and each ending in a ſtate of peace, ſafety and happineſs to the church of God, it ſeems to me to be more ingenious than ſolid, and that many things might be ſaid to demonſtrate it not to be founded in the truth of things, and the real deſign of the divine author of this prophecy. But now to enter into a particular and full examination of it, would be to lengthen out this diſcourſe far beyond its proper limits. I would only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, (which directly concerns my preſent purpoſe) that to make out this ſcheme, Mr. Lowman ſuppoſes that the fifth and ſixth trumpets, that bring on the two firſt woes, and the whole ninth chapter of the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, altogether reſpects the Saracens. But it appears to me not very credible, that the Saracens ſhould have ſo much ſaid of them in this prophecy, as to have a whole chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter taken up about them, and not a word in the prophecy be ſaid about the Turks, who immediately ſucceeded them<note n="*" place="bottom">For though it be true, that the reign of Othman, or Ottoman, who began what they call the Ottoman empire, was a long time after this; yet the Turks themſelves, under other princes, in the government they ſet up in territories that had formerly been poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed by Chriſtians, and in their over-running and ravaging Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian countries, immediately ſucceeding the Saracens; and from thenceforward have been a terrible, and almoſt continual ſcourge to the church.</note> in the ſame
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:026594_0266_0FD0B3D3A7C945B0"/>religion, and proceeding on the ſame prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and were ſo much more conſiderable, and brought vaſtly greater calamities on the Chriſtian world, and have ſet up and long maintained one of the greateſt, ſtrongeſt and moſt extraordinary empires that ever the world ſaw, and have been the moſt terrible ſcourge to Chriſtendom, that ever Divine Providence made uſe of, and one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of all God's plagues on the world of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Lowman, in purſuance of his ſcheme, alſo ſuppoſes, (which is yet more incredible) this period of the trumpets ends in <hi>a ſtate of ſafety, peace and happineſs to the church of God;</hi> ſo that, on that occaſion, <hi>there are great voices in heaven, ſaying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chriſt.</hi> And yet he ſuppoſes, that it iſſues in ſetting up the kingdom of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt; and that about that very time, when theſe heavenly voices ſo joyfully proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this, the beaſt was enthroned, and the time, times and half, or one thouſand two
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:026594_0267_0FD0B3D5270E5250"/>hundred and ſixty days of his reign began, which is ſpoken of every where, as the time of the church's greateſt darkneſs and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the time wherein <hi>the little horn ſhould wear out the ſaints of the Moſt High. The time appointed for his ſcattering the power of the holy people. The time of the woman's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the wilderneſs. The time of treading under foot the court of the temple.</hi> And <hi>the time of the witneſſes propheſying in ſackcloth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>However, I do not deny that the time when Mr. Lowman ſuppoſes the reign of the beaſt began, even the time when Pepin confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Pope his temporal dominions in Italy, was a time of the great increaſe and advancement of the power of Antichriſt in the world, and a notable epoch. And if I may be allowed humbly to offer what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me to be the truth with relation to the riſe and fall of Antichriſt, it is this—As the power of Antichriſt, and the corruption of the apoſtate church, roſe not at once, but by ſeveral notable ſteps and degrees, ſo it will in the like manner fall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> and that divers ſteps and ſeaſons of deſtruction to the ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual Babylon, and revival and advancement of the true c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>rch, are propheſied of under one. Though it be true, that there is ſome
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:026594_0268_0FD0B3D71392F4B0"/>particular event, that prevails above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the intention of the prophecy, ſome remarkable ſeaſon of the deſtruction of the church of Rome, and the papal power and corruption, and advancement of true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that the prophecies have a principal reſpect to.</p>
                  <p>It was certainly thus with regard to the prophecies of the deſtruction of old Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, and the church's deliverance from cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity and oppreſſion by that city and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which is abundantly alluded to in theſe prophecies of the Revelation, as a noted type of the oppreſſion of the church of Chriſt by the church of Rome, calling the latter ſo often by the name of Babylon, and the church of Chriſt Jeruſalem. The captivity of the Jews by the Babylonians was not perfected at once, but was brought on by ſeveral not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſteps. So neither was the reſtoration of the Jewiſh church, after the captivity, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected at once. It was ſeveral times fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, that the duration of the captivity ſhould be ſeventy years; and alſo, that after ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years were accompliſhed, God would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy Babylon. But this period had mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly ſeveral different beginnings, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral endings. Thus from Jehoiakim's capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:026594_0269_0FD0B3D8F0AEEBD0"/>to Cyrus's decree, for the return of the Jews, and the rebuilding of Jeruſalem, was ſeventy years. And from Zedekiah's capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity to Darius's decree ſeventy years. And from the laſt carrying away of all, to the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing and dedication of the temple, was alſo ſeventy years. So alſo the prophecies of Babylon's deſtruction were fulfilled by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſteps. Theſe prophecies feem to have a principal reſpect to that deſtruction that was accompliſhed by Cyrus, at the end of the firſt ſeventy years fore-mentioned; but there were other things in the very ſame prophecies, that were not fulfilled until the fourth year of Darius, when what remained of Babylon was ſubjected to another dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful deſtruction, which, in a great meaſure, completed its deſolation, which was at the end of the ſecond ſeventy years, and at the ſame time that the reſtoration of the Jews was perfected by the decree of Darius.<note n="*" place="bottom">Prideanx's Connection, part I. p. 183, 184, and 267, 268, 269.

<pb n="269" facs="unknown:026594_0270_0FD0B3DA68CBF840"/>of ſerpents and wild beaſts, that were not fulfilled until more than two hundred years after, in the time of Seleucus king of Syria.<note n="*" place="bottom">Prid.

Theſe prophecies of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Tyre were fulfilled by various ſteps. Many things were fulfilled in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the old city by Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. 128, 129, 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And yet both theſe deſolations are propheſied of under one.</p>
                  <p>And thus it ſeems to me very probable, that it will prove, with reſpect to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies of the deſtruction of myſtical Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon. It is, I think, pretty manifeſt by the prophecies, that this anti-chriſtian hierarchy and apoſtate church will at laſt be ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, that there ſhall be no remainders of
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:026594_0271_0FD0B3DBE6969210"/>it left, and ſhall have as perfect a deſolation, before God has done with her, as old Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon had; there ſhall be no ſuch thing as Pope or church of Rome in the world.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Rev. xviii. 21—23. and xix. 20, 21.

This appears by that moſt particular and large deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that deſtruction, Rev. xviii. There it ſeems to be implied, not only that many ſhall yet remain of the church of Rome, that ſhall bewail her overthrow, of her people and clergy, but that there ſhould be ſome princes among them, <hi>Kings of the earth, that have committed fornication, and lived delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly with her.</hi> And it is exceeding improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in itſelf, that every Papiſt, in each quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the world, ſhould be deſtroyed, or ceaſe from the world, at one blow.

<pb n="273" facs="unknown:026594_0274_0FD0B3E067E5F958"/>of the church in one great conflict with her enemies. This would contradict many things in ſcripture, which repreſent this great event to be brought to paſs by a gradual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of religion; as leaven that gradually ſpreads, until it has diffuſed itſelf, through the whole lump, and a plant of muſtard, which from a very ſmall ſeed, gradually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a great tree. <hi>And like ſeed which a man caſts upon the ground, that ſprings and grows up, night and day; and firſt brings forth the blade, then the ear, then the full corn in the ear.</hi> And eſpecially would this contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the prophetical repreſentation in Ezek. xlvii. where the progreſs of religion is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by the gradual increaſe of the waters of the fanctuary; being firſt a ſmall ſpring iſſuing out from under the threſhold of the temple, and then after they had run a thouſand cubits, being up to the ankles; and at the end of another thouſand cubits, up to the knees; and at the end of another thouſand, up to the loins; and afterwards a great riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that could not be paſſed over; and being finally brought into the ſea, and healing the waters even of the vaſt ocean. If the Spirit of God ſhould be immediately poured out,
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:026594_0275_0FD0B3E3617FA348"/>and that work of God's power and grace ſhould now begin, which, in its progreſs and iſſue, ſhould complete this glorious effect; there muſt be an amazing and unparalleled progreſs of the work and manifeſtation of divine power to bring ſo much to paſs, by the year two thouſand. Would it not be a great thing, to be accompliſhed in one half century, that religion, in the power and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of it, ſhould ſo prevail, as to gain the conqueſt over all thoſe many things that ſtand in oppoſition to it among Proteſtants, and gain the upper hand through the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant world? And if in another, it ſhould go on ſo to prevail, as to get the victory o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all the oppoſition and ſtrength of the kingdom of Antichriſt, ſo as to gain the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendancy in that which is now the Popiſh world? And if in a third half century, it ſhould prevail and ſubdue the greater part of the Mahometan world, and bring in the Jewiſh nation, in all their diſperſions? And when in the next whole century, the whole heathen world ſhould be enlightened and converted to the Chriſtian ſaith, throughout all parts of Africa, Aſia, America and Terra Auſtralis, and be thoroughly ſettled in Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian ſaith and order, without any remainders
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:026594_0276_0FD0B3E7D71E7500"/>of their old deluſions and ſuperſtitions, and this attended with an utter extirpation of the remnant of the church of Rome, and all the relicts of mahometaniſm, hereſy, ſchiſm and enthuſiaſm, and a ſuppreſſion of all remains of open vice and immorality, and every ſort of viſible enemy to true religion, through the whole earth, and bring to an end all the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy commotions, tumults, and calamities occaſioned by ſuch great changes, and all things be ſo adjuſted and ſettled through the world, that the world henceforward ſhould enjoy an holy reſt or ſabbatiſm.</p>
                  <p>I have thus diſtinguiſhed what belongs to a bringing of the world from its preſent ſtate, to the happy ſtate of the Millennium, the better to give a view of the greatneſs of the work; and not, that I pretend ſo much as to conjecture, that things will be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed juſt in this order.

                  <p>The prophecy of the ſixth Vial, Rev. xvi. 12—16. if we take it in its connection with the other Vials, and conſider thoſe provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential events, by which the preceding Vials have manifeſtly been fulfilled, I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, affords juſt ground for ſuch a hope.</p>
                  <p>It is very plain, from this whole chapter, as alſo the preceding and following, that all theſe ſeven Vials are Vials of God's wrath on Antichriſt; one is not poured out on the Jews, another on the Turks, another on Pagans. another on the church of Rome; but they all ſignify God's ſucceſſive judgments or plagues on the beaſt and his kingdom, which is in this chapter and almoſt every where in this book, called GREAT BABYLON. And therefore undoubtedly, when it is ſaid, <hi>The
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:026594_0278_0FD0B3E7ED3234A8"/>ſixth angel poured out his Vial on the river Euphrates, and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the eaſt might be prepared.</hi> By the river Euphrates is meant ſomething ſome way appertaining to this myſtical Babylon, as that river that ran thro' Chaldea, called Euphrates, was ſomething appertaining to the literal Babylon. And it is very manifeſt, that here is in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of this Vial an alluſion to that by which the way was prepared for the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Babylon by Cyrus, which was by turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the channel of the river Euphrates, which ran through the midſt of the city, whereby the way of the kings of the eaſt, the princes of Media and Perſia, was prepared to come in under the walls of the city, at each end, where the waters uſed to run, and deſtroy it; as they did that night wherein Daniel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted the hand-writing on the wall, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Belſhazzar, Dan. v. 30. The prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Babylon's deſtruction do, from time to time, take notice of this way of deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her, by drying up the waters of the riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Euphrates, to prepare the way for her enemies, Iſai. xliv. 27, 28. <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="279" facs="unknown:026594_0280_0FD0B3E7FB2641F8"/>on the myſtical Babylon, and the effect of it, the drying up the channel of the river Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates, is the laſt thing done againſt it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore its actual deſtruction by the ſeventh Vial, and opens the way for thoſe that fight in a ſpiritual war againſt it, ſpeedily to bring on its ruin.</p>
                  <p>Hence I think it may, without diſpute, be determined, that by the river Euphrates in the prophecy of this Vial, is meant ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing appertaining or relating to the myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Babylon, or the anti-chriſtian church and kingdom, that ſerves that, or is a benefit to it, in a way anſwerable to that in which the river Euphrates ſerved old Babylon, and the removal of which will in like manner pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the way for her enemies to deſtroy her. And therefore what we have to do in the firſt place, in order to find out what is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the river Euphrates, in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, is to conſider how the literal Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates ſerved old Babylon. And it may be noted that Euphrates was of remarkable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to that great city in two reſpects; it ſerved the city as a ſupply—it was let thro' the midſt of the city by an artificial canal, and ran through the midſt of the palace of the king of Babylon; that part of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:026594_0281_0FD0B3E965FAB7A0"/>called the Old Palace, ſtanding on one ſide, and the other part called the New Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, on the other; with communications from one part to another, above the waters, by a bridge, and under the waters, by a vault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or arched paſſage, that the city, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the palace, might have the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience of its waters, and be plentifully ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with water. And another way that the waters of Euphrates ſerved Babylon, was as an impediment and obſtacle in the way of its enemies, to hinder their acceſs to it to deſtroy it; for there was a vaſt moat round the city, without the walls, of prodigious width and depth, filled with the water of the river, to hinder the acceſs of her beſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and at each end of the city, the river ſerved inſtead of walls. And therefore when Cyrus had dried up the river, the moat was emptied, and the channel of the river un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the walls left dry, and ſo his way was prepared.</p>
                  <p>And therefore it is natural to ſuppoſe, that by drying up the waters of the river Euphrates, in the prophecy of the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the new Babylon, to prepare the way of her enemies, is meant the drying up her incomes and ſupplies, and the removal of
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:026594_0282_0FD0B3EB10A86780"/>thoſe things that hitherto have been the chief obſtacles in the way of thoſe that, in this book, are repreſented as at war with her, and ſeeking her deſtruction, (ſpoken of Rev. xix. 11. to the end, and chap. xii. 7.) that have hindered their progreſs and ſucceſs, or that have been the chief impediments in the way of the Proteſtant religion. The firſt thing is the drying the ſtreams of the wealth of the new Babylon, the temporal ſupplies, revenues, and vaſt incomes of the Romiſh church, and the riches of the Popiſh domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. Waters in ſcripture language very often ſignify proviſion and ſupplies, both temporal and ſpiritual, as in Prov. ix. 17. Iſai. xxxiii. 16.—xliii. 20.—lv. 1. and lviii. 11. Jer. ii. 13 and 18.—xvii. 8 and 13. and in other places innumerable. The tempor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſupplies of a people are very often in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture called waters, as Iſai. v. 13. <hi>Therefore my people is gone into captivity, and their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable men are famiſhed, and their multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude dried up with thirſt,</hi> i. e. deprived of the ſupports and ſupplies of life. And the drying up the waters of a city or kingdom, is often uſed in ſcripture prophecy, for the depriving them of their wealth, as the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:026594_0283_0FD0B3EE4503B4E8"/>explains itſelf, Hoſ. xiii. 15. <hi>His ſprings ſhall become dry, and his fountain ſhall be dried up: He ſhall ſpoil the treaſure of all pleaſant veſſels.</hi> Iſai. xv. 6, 7. <hi>The waters of Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim ſhall be deſolate, for the hay is withered, the graſs faileth, there is no green thing.— Therefore the abundance they have gotten, and that which they have laid up, ſhall they carry away to the brook of the willows.</hi> By the brook of the willows there ſeems to be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the waters of Aſſyria or Chaldea, whoſe ſtreams abounded with willows. So that the carrying away the treaſures of Moab, and adding of them to the treaſures of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyria, is here repreſented by the figure of turning away the waters of Nimrim from the country of Moab, and adding them to the waters of Aſſyria, as the prophecy explains itſelf. Yea, even in the prophecies of the deſtruction of Babylon itſelf, the depriving her of her treaſures, ſeems to be one thing intended by the drying up of her waters.— This ſeems manifeſt by the words of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy in Jer. l. 37, 38. <hi>A ſword is upon her treaſures, and they ſhall be robbed; a drought is upon her waters, and they ſhall be dried up.</hi> Compared with chap. li. 15. <hi>O thou that dwelleſt upon many waters, abundant in trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures;</hi>
                     <pb n="283" facs="unknown:026594_0284_0FD0B3F096869230"/>with ver. 36. <hi>I will dry up her ſea, and make her ſprings dry.</hi> The wealth, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, and vaſt incomes of the church of Rome, are the waters by which that Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon has been nouriſhed and ſupported; theſe are the waters which the Popiſh clergy and members of the Romiſh hierarchy thirſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and are continually drinking down, with inſatiable appetite; and they are waters that have been flowing into that ſpiritual city like a great river; eccleſiaſtical perſons poſſeſſing a very great part of the Popiſh dominions; as this Babylon is repreſented as vaſtly rich, in the prophecy of the Apocalypſe, eſpecially in the 17th and 18th chapters. Theſe are eſpecially the waters that ſupply the palace of the king of this new Babylon, viz. the Pope, as the river Euphrates ran through the midſt of the palace of the king of old Babylon. The revenues of the Pope have been like waters of a great river, coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his palace, from innumerable fountains, and by innumerable branches and leſſer ſtreams, coming from many various and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant countries.</p>
                  <p>This prophecy repreſents to us two cities very contrary the one to the other—viz. New Babylon and the New Jeruſalem, and
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:026594_0285_0FD0B3F1E3148F70"/>a river running through the midſt of each. —The New Jeruſalem, which ſignifies the church of Chriſt, eſpecially in her beſt eſtate, is deſcribed as having a river running thro' the midſt of it, Rev. xxii. 1, 2. This river, as might eaſily be made moſt evident, by comparing this with abundance of other ſcriptures, undoubtedly ſignifies the divine ſupplies, and rich and abundant ſpiritual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes and proviſion of that holy city. Mr. Lowman, in his late Expoſition, ſays, <q>It repreſents a conſtant proviſion for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable and happy life of all the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of this city of God.</q> And in his notes on the ſame place, obſerves as follows: <q>Water, (ſays he), as neceſſary to the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of life, and as it contributes in great cities, eſpecially in hot eaſtern countries, to the ornament of the place, and delight of the inhabitants, is a very proper repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the enjoyment of all things, both for the ſupport and pleaſure of life.</q> As the river that runs through the new Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, the church of Chriſt, that refreſhes that holy ſpiritual ſociety, ſignifies their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſupplies, to ſatisfy their ſpiritual thirſt, ſo the river that runs through the new Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, the anti-chriſtian church, that wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:026594_0286_0FD0B3F3EF3D3360"/>carnal ſociety, ſignifies, according to the oppoſite character of the city, her worldly, carnal ſupplies, to ſatisfy their carnal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and thirſtings.</p>
                  <p>This new Jeruſalem is called in this book the Paradiſe of God, and therefore is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as having the tree of life growing in it. And it being deſcribed, as though a riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ran through the midſt of it, there ſeems to be ſome alluſion to the ancient paradiſe in Eden, of which we are told that there ran a river through the midſt of it to water it; <hi>i. e.</hi> to ſupply the plants of it with nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And this river was this very ſame ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Euphrates, that afterwards ran through Babylon. And in one and the other, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the divers ſupplies of two oppoſite cities; in Eden, it repreſented the ſpiritual ſupplies and wealth of the true Chriſtian church, in her ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                        <desc>••••</desc>
                     </gap>al advancement and glory, and ſeems to be ſo made uſe of, Rev. xxii. 1, 2. In the other it repreſented the outward carnal ſupplies of the falſe anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian church, in her worldly pomp and vain glory, chap. xvi. 12.</p>
                  <p>When the waters, that ſupply this myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Babylon, come to be dried up in this ſenſe, it will prepare the way for the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:026594_0287_0FD0B42B2EF45708"/>of anti-chriſtian corruption, that ſeek her overthrow. The wealth of the church of Rome, and of the powers that ſupport it, is very much its defence. After the ſtreams of her revenues and riches are dried up, or very greatly diminiſhed, her walls will be as it were broken down, and ſhe will become weak and defenceleſs, and expoſed to eaſy ruin.</p>

<pb n="288" facs="unknown:026594_0289_0FD0B42C26D3E160"/>chap. xii. 7. and xix. 11. to the end—Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael the king of angels, and his angels; he <hi>whoſe name is called the Word of God, and that has on his veſture, and on his thigh, a name written, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords; and the heavenly armies that follow him, cloathed in fine linen, white and clean.</hi> Cyrus, the chief of the kings of the eaſt, that deſtroyed Babylon, and redeemed God's church from thence, and reſtored Jeruſalem, ſeems, in that particular affair, very mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly to be ſpoken of as a type of Chriſt: God calls him <hi>his ſhepherd, to perform his pleaſure, to ſay to Jeruſalem—Thou ſhalt be built, and to the temple—Thy foundation ſhall be laid.</hi> God calls him his Meſſiah. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord to his anointed,</hi> (in the origin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al <hi>to his Meſſiah) to Cyrus.</hi> He is ſpoken of as one <hi>that God had raiſed up in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that he might build his city, and freely redeem his captives, or let them go without price or reward.</hi> He is ſaid to be one whom <hi>God had loved;</hi> in like manner as the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah is ſaid to be <hi>God's elect, in whom his ſoul delighteth.</hi> As by Babylon, in the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is meant that anti-chriſtian ſociety that is typiſied by old Babylon; ſo by the kings of the eaſt, that ſhould deſtroy this and
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:026594_0290_0FD0B409D6408C68"/>chriſtian church, muſt be meant thoſe ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of it that were typiſied by Cyrus, and other chieftians of the eaſt, that deſtroyed old Babylon; viz. Chriſt, who was born, lived, died, and roſe in the eaſt, together with thoſe ſpiritual princes that follow him, the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities and powers in heavenly places, and thoſe miniſters and ſaints that are kings and prieſts, and ſhall reign on earth; eſpecially thoſe leaders and heads of God's people—thoſe Chriſtian miniſters and magiſtrates, that ſhall be diſtinguiſhed as public bleſſings to his church, and chief inſtruments of the overthrow of Antichriſt.</p>
                  <p>As the river Euphrates ſerved the city of Babylon as a ſupply, ſo it alſo was before obſerved, it ſerved as an impediment or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle to hinder the acceſs of its enemies; as there was a vaſt moat round the city, filled with the water of the river, which was leſt empty when Euphrates was dried up. And therefore we may ſuppoſe, that another thing meant by the effect of the ſixth Vial, is the removal of thoſe things which hitherto have been the chief obſtacles in the way of the progreſs of the true religion, and the victory of the church of Chriſt over-her enemies;
<pb n="290" facs="unknown:026594_0291_0FD0B42DAA3AE9C0"/>which have been the corrupt doctrines and practices that have prevailed in Proteſtant countries, and the doubts and diſſiculties that attend many doctrines of the true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the many diviſions and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that ſubſiſt among Proteſtants. The removal of thoſe would wonderfully prepare the way for Chriſt and his armies, to go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and prevail againſt their enemies, in a glorious propagation of true religion. So that this Vial, which is to prepare the way for Chriſt and his people, ſeems to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to that remarkable preparing the way for Chriſt, by <hi>levelling mountains, exalting valleys, drying up rivers,</hi> and <hi>removing ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-blocks,</hi> which is often ſpoken of in the prophecies, as what ſhall next precede the church's latter-day glory, as Iſai. xlii. 13, &amp;c. <hi>The Lord ſhall go forth as a mighty man; he ſhall ſtir up jealouſy as a man of war; he ſhall prevail againſt his enemies.—I will make waſte mountains and hills, and dryup all their herbs; and I will make the rivers iſlands, and I will dry up the pools; and I will bring the blind by a way that they know not, and I will lend them in paths that they have not known; I will make darkneſs light before them, and crooked things ſtraight: theſe things will I do
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:026594_0292_0FD0B409E1507CF8"/>unto them, and not forſake them.</hi> Chap. xl. 3, 4, 5. <hi>Prepare ye the way of the Lord; make ſtraight in the deſart an high-way for our God: every valley ſhall be exalted, and every mountain and hill ſhall be made low, and the crooked ſhall be made ſtraight, and rough places plain; and the glory of the Lord ſhall be revealed, and all fleſh ſhall ſee it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</hi> Chap. xi. 15, 16. <hi>And the Lord ſhall deſtroy the tongue of the Egyptian ſea, and with his mighty wind ſhall he ſhake his hand over the river, and shall ſmite it in the ſeven ſtreams thereof, and make men go over dry shod; and there shall be an high-way for the remnant of his people which shall be left, from Aſſyria, like as it was to Iſrael, in the day that he came out of the land of Egypt.</hi> Chap. lvii. 14. <hi>Caſt ye up, caſt ye up, prepare the way, take up the ſtumbling-block out of the way of my people.</hi> And chap. lxii. 10. <hi>Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; caſt up, caſt up the high-way; ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out the ſtones; lift up a ſtandard for the people.</hi> Zech. x. 10, 11, 12. <hi>I will bring them again alſo out of the land of Egypt, and gather them out of Aſſyria; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon; and place shall not be found for them. And
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:026594_0293_0FD0B42FB33BF398"/>he shall paſs through the ſea with affliction, and shall ſmite the waves of the ſea; and all the deeps of the river shall day up; and the pride of Aſſyria shall be brought down, and the ſceptre of Egypt shall depart away: And I will ſtrengthen them in the Lord, and they shell walk up and down in his name, ſaith the Lord.</hi> And it is worthy to be remarked, that as Cyrus's deſtroying Babylon, and letting go God's captives from thence, and reſtoring Jeruſalem, is certainly typical of Chriſt's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying myſtical Babylon, and delivering his people from her tyranny, and gloriouſly building up the ſpiritual Jeruſalem in the latter days; ſo God's preparing Cyrus's way, by drying up the river Euphrates, is ſpoken of in terms like thoſe that are uſed in thoſe prophecies that have been mentioned, to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify the preparing Chriſt's way, when he ſhall come to accompliſh the latter event. Thus God ſays concerning Cyrus, Iſai. xlv. 2. <hi>I will go before thee, and</hi> MAKE CROOKED PLACES STRAIGHT. And ver. 13. <hi>I will direct,</hi> or <hi>make ſtraight</hi> (as it is in the margin) <hi>all his ways.</hi> This is like chap. xl. 2, 4. <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare ye the way of the Lord; make ſtraight in the deſar! an high-way for our God.—The crooked things ſhall be made ſtraight.</hi> Chap.
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:026594_0294_0FD0B409E75D83C0"/>xlii. 16. <hi>I will make darkneſs light before them, and crooked things ſtraight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If any ſhould object againſt underſtanding the river Euphrates, in Rev. xvi. 12. as ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying what has been ſuppoſed, that when mention is made of the river Euphrates, in another place in this prophecy, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly not ſo to be underſtood, viz. in chap. ix. 14. <hi>Saying to the ſixth angel which had the trumpet—Looſe the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates:</hi> and that there is no reaſon to underſtand the river Euphrates in the viſion of the ſixth Vial, as ſignifying ſomething diverſe from what is meant by the ſame river in the viſion of the ſixth trumpet.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, That there appears to me to be good reaſon for a diverſe underſtanding of the river Euphrates in theſe two different places; the diverſity of the ſcence of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and of the kind of repreſentation, in thoſe two divers parts of this prophecy, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally leads to it, and requires it. It is in this book as in the Old Teſtament; when the river Euphrates is ſpoken of in the Old Teſtament, both in the hiſtories and prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, it is mentioned, with reſpect to the two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold relation of that river, viz. 1ſt, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="294" facs="unknown:026594_0295_0FD0B4319E275088"/>to its relation to Babylon. And as it was related to that, it was ſomething belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that city, as its defence and ſupply, as has been repreſented. Thus the river Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates is ſpoken of in many places that have been already obſerved, and others that might be mentioned. 2dly. This river is ſpoken of with regard to its relation to the land of Iſrael, God's viſible people; and as it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to that, it was its eaſtern boundary. It is ſo ſpoken of, Gen. xv. 18. Exod. xxiii. 31. Deut. i. 7. and xi. 24. Joſh. i. 4.2 Sam. viii. 3.1 Chron. xviii. 3.1 King iv. 21. Ezra iv. 20. Agreeable to this diverſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect or relation of this river, under which it is mentioned in the Old Teſtament, ſo muſt we underſtand it differently in different parts of the prophecy of this book of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, according as the nature and ſubject of the viſion requires. In the xvth chapter, where the prophecy is about Babylon, and the viſion is of God's plagues on Babylon, preparing the way for her deſtruction, there, when the river Euphrates is mentioned, we are naturally and neceſſarily led to conſider it as ſomething belonging to Babylon, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to the myſtical Babylon, as Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates did to old Babylon. But we cannot
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:026594_0296_0FD0B40B264499B0"/>underſtand it ſo in the ixth chapter, for there the prophecy is not about Babylon. To men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Euphrates there, as ſomething belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Babylon, would have been improper; for the nature of the viſion, and prophetical repreſentation, did not lead to it, nor allow it. John had had no viſion of Babylon; that kind of repreſentation had not been made to him; there is not a word ſaid about Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon till we come to the ſecond part of this prophecy, after John had the viſion of the ſecond book, and Chriſt had ſaid to him— <hi>Thou muſt prophecy again before peoples, and nations, and kings,</hi> chap. xi. The ſcene of the viſion, in the former part of the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, had been more eſpecially the land of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, and the viſion is concerning two ſorts of perſons there, viz. thoſe of the tribes of Iſrael that had the ſeal of God in their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads, and thoſe wicked apoſtate Iſraelites that had not this mark. Compare chap. vii. 3—8. and chap. ix. 4. The viſion in this ixth chapter, is of God's jndgments on thoſe of the tribes of Iſrael, or in the land of Iſrael, which had not the ſeal of God in their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads; and therefore when mention is made, ver. 14. of a judgment coming on them from the river Euphrates, this river is here ſpoken
<pb n="296" facs="unknown:026594_0297_0FD0B434665BE2A0"/>of in the former reſpect, viz. with regard to its relation to the land of Iſrael, as its eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern border; and thereby we muſt underſtand that God would bring ſome terrible calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on Chriſtendom from its eaſtern border, as he did when the Turks were let looſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſtendom.</p>
                  <p>If theſe things that have been ſpoken of, are intended in the prophecy of the ſixth Vial, it affords, as I conceive, great reaſon to hope that the beginning of that glorious work of God's Spirit, which, in the progreſs and iſſue of it, will overthrow Antichriſt, and introduce the glory of the latter days, is not very far off.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Lowman has, I think, put it beyond all reaſonable doubt, that the fifth Vial was poured out in the time of the Reformation. It alſo appears ſatisfyingly, by his late Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, that take one Vial with another, it has not been two hundred years from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of one Vial to the beginning of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but about one hundred and eighty years. But it is now two hundred and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years ſince the fifth Vial began to be poured, and it is a long time ſince the main effects of it have been ſiniſhed. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the ſixth Vial has not already began
<pb n="297" facs="unknown:026594_0298_0FD0B40CD154C098"/>to be poured out, it may well be ſpeedily expected.</p>
                  <p>But with regard to the firſt thing that I have ſuppoſed to be ſignified by the effect of this Vial, viz. The drying up the fountains and ſtreams of the wealth and temporal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes and ſupplies of the antichriſtian church and territories, I would propoſe it to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, whether <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> no many things that have come to paſs within theſe twenty years paſt, may not be looked upon as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable beginnings of a fulfilment of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy; particularly what the kings of Spain and Portugal did ſome years ſince, when diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with the Pope, forbidding any thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward going to Rome for inveſtitures, &amp;c. thereby cutting off two great ſtreams of the Pope's wealth, from ſo great and rich a part of the Popiſh world; and its becoming ſo frequent a thing of late for Popiſh princes, in their wars, to make bold with the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the church, and to tax the clergy within their dominions, as well as laity; or which is equivalent, to oblige them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute great ſums, under the name of a free gift; and alſo the late peeling and impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing the Pope's temporal dominions in
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:026594_0299_0FD07FDE8BDB9D30"/>Italy, by the armies of the Auſtrians, Nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politans and Spaniards, paſſing and repaſſing through them, and living ſo much at diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in them, of which the Pope has ſo loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly complained, and in vain; receiving no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but menaces, when he has objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt giving liberty for the like paſſage for the future. Theſe things make it hopeful that the time is coming when the princes of Europe, <hi>the ten horns, ſhall hate the whore, and make her deſolate and naked, and eat her fleſh,</hi> as Rev. xvii. 16. which will prepare the way for what next follows, <hi>her being burnt with fire;</hi> even as the ſixth Vial poured out, to conſume the ſupplies of Antichriſt, and ſtrip him naked of his wealth, and, as it were, to pick his fleſh off from his bones, will make way for what next follows, the ſeventh Vial, that will conſume Antichriſt, by the ſierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God's wrath.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things duly conſidered, I imagine, afford us ground to ſuppoſe, not only that the effect of this ſixth Vial is already begun, but that ſome progreſs is already made in it, and that this Vial is now running apace. And when it ſhall be finiſhed, there is all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſuppoſe that the deſtruction of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt will very ſpeedily follow, and that the
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:026594_0300_0FD0B40E45263108"/>two laſt Vials will ſucceed one another more cloſely than the other Vials. When once the river Euphrates was dried up, and Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus's way was prepared, he delayed not, but immediately entered into the city to deſtroy it. Nor is it God's manner, when once his way is prepared, to delay to deliver his church, and ſhew mercy to Zion. When once impediments are removed, Chriſt will no longer remain at a diſtance, but will be like a roe or a young hart, coming ſwiftly to the help of his people. When that cry is made, <hi>Caſt ye up, caſt ye up, prepare the way,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The high and lofty One that inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits eternity, is repreſented as very near to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive the ſpirit of the contrite, and deliver his people with whom he had been wroth.</hi> When that cry is made, Iſai. xl. <hi>Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make ſtraight in the deſart an high-way for our God; every valley ſhall be exalted,</hi> &amp;c. God tells his church, <hi>that her warfare is accompliſhed, and the time to comfort her is come, and that the glory of the Lord n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> ſhall be revealed, and all fleſh ſee it together.</hi> And agreeably to theſe things, Chriſt, on the pouring out the ſixth Vial, ſays, <hi>Behold I come.</hi> The ſixth Vial is the forerunner of the ſeventh or laſt, to prepare
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:026594_0301_0FD0B437A09A1D78"/>its way. The angel that pours out this Vial is the harbinger of Chriſt, and when the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binger is come, the king is at hand. John the Baptiſt, that was Chriſt's harbinger, who came to level mountains and fill up vallies, proclaimed, <hi>The kingdom of heaven is at hand;</hi> and when he had prepared Chriſt's way, then <hi>the Lord ſuddenly came into his temple, even the meſſenger of the covenant.</hi> Mal. iii. 1.</p>
                  <p>It is true, that we do not know how long this Vial may continue running, and ſo Chriſt's way preparing, before it is fully prepared; but yet if there be reaſon to think the effect of this Vial is begun, or is near, then there is reaſon alſo to think that the beginning of that great work of God's Spirit, in reviving of religion, which, before it is finiſhed, will iſſue in Antichriſt's ruin, is not far off. For it is pretty manifeſt, that the beginning of this work will accompany the ſixth Vial; for the gathering together of the armies on both ſides, on the ſide of Chriſt and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, to that great battle that ſhall iſſue in the overthrow of the latter, will be under this Vial; (compare Rev. xvi. 12, 13, 14. with chap. xix. 11. to the end.) And it is plain, that Chriſt's manifeſting himſelf, and wonderfully appearing after long hiding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:026594_0302_0FD0B40FA8D98500"/>to plead his own and his people's cauſe, and riding forth againſt his enemies in a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious manner, and his people's following him in pure linen, or the practice of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and pure religion, will be the thing that will give the alarm to Antichriſt, and cauſe him to gather that vaſt hoſt to make the utmoſt oppoſition. But this alarm and gathering together is repreſented as being under the ſixth Vial; ſo that it will be a great revival, and mighty progreſs of true religion under the ſixth Vial, eminently threatening the ſpeedy and utter overthrow of Satan's kingdom on earth, that will ſo mightily rouſe the old ſerpent; to exert him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with ſuch exceeding violence, in that greateſt conflict and ſtruggle that ever he had with Chriſt and the church, ſince the world ſtood.<note n="*" place="bottom">If there be any miſtake here, it is an anticipation of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Antichriſt, through the prevalence of vital religion, inſtead of the preſent rod of the divine indignation; but, it may be, there is a warfare between truth and error yet to come, towards which our author's views might be directed, and for which it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes us all to be prepared.

                  <p>All the ſeven Vials bring terrible judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon Antichriſt; but there ſeems to be ſomething diſtinguiſhing of the three laſt, the fifth, ſixth and ſeventh, viz. That they
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:026594_0303_0FD0B439617ACD00"/>more directly tend to the overthrow of his kingdom, and accordingly each of them is attended with a great reviving of religion. The fifth Vial was attended with ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vival and reformation, that greatly weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and diminiſhed the throne or kingdom of the beaſt, and went far towards its ruin. It ſeems as though the ſixth Vial ſhould be much more ſo, for it is the diſtinguiſhing note of this Vial, that it is the preparatory Vial, which more than any other Vial pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares the way for Chriſt's coming to deſtroy the kingdom of Antichriſt, and to ſet up his own kingdom in the world. A great out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouring of the Spirit accompanied that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation which was preparatory to Chriſt's coming in his public miniſtry, in the days of his fleſh; ſo, much more, will a great out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouring of the Spirit accompany the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation that will be preparatory to Chriſt's coming in his kingdom.</p>
                  <p>And beſides thoſe things which belong to the preparation of Chriſt's way, which are ſo often repreſented by levelling mountains, drying up rivers, &amp;c. viz. The unravelling intricacies, and removing difficulties attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſtian doctrines, the diſtinguiſhing between true religion and its falſe appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances,
<pb n="303" facs="unknown:026594_0304_0FD0B4112830BA10"/>the detecting and exploding errors and corrupt principles, and the reforming the wicked lives of profeſſors, which have been the chief ſtumbling-blocks and obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles that have hitherto hindered the progreſs of true religion; I ſay, theſe things, which ſeem to belong to this preparatory Vial, are the proper work of the Spirit of God, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting and advancing divine light and true piety, and can be the effect of nothing elſe.</p>
                  <p>Agreeably to what has been ſuppoſed, that an extraordinary out-pouring of the Spirit of God is to accompany this ſixth Vial; ſo the beginning of a work of extraordinary a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakening has already attended the probable beginning of this Vial; and has been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in one place or other, for many years paſt; although it has been, in ſome places, mingled with much enthuſiaſm, after the manner of things in their firſt beginnings, unripe, and mixed with much crudity. But it is to be hoped, a far more pure, exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and glorious revival of religion is not far off, which will more properly be the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of that work, which, in its iſſue, ſhall overthrow the kingdom of Antichriſt, and of Satan through the world.

                  <p>I would ſay ſomething to one objection more, and then haſten to a concluſion of this diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 6. Some may be ready to object, that what is propoſed in this memorial is a new thing, ſuch as never was put in practice in the church of God before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. If there be ſomething circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially new in it, this cannot be a ſufficient objection. The duty of prayer is no new duty; for many of God's people expreſsly to agree, as touching ſomething they ſhall aſk in prayer, is no new thing; for God's people to agree on circumſtances of time and place for united prayer, according to their own diſcretion, is no new thing; for many, in different places, to agree to offer up ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary prayers to God, at the ſame time, as a token of their union, is no new thing, but has been commonly practiſed in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of days of faſting and prayer for
<pb n="306" facs="unknown:026594_0307_0FD0B43CB77D3340"/>ſpecial mercies. And if the people of God ſhould engage in the duty of prayer, for the coming of Chriſt's kingdom, in a new man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, in that reſpect, that they reſolve they will not be ſo negligent of this duty, as has been common with profeſſors of religion heretofore, but will be more frequent and fervent in it; this would be ſuch a new thing as ought to be, and would be only to reform a former negligence. And for the people of God, in various parts of the world, viſibly, and by expreſs agreement, to unite for this extraordinary prayer, is no more than their duty, and no more than what it is foretold the people of God ſhould actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do, before the time comes of the church's promiſed glory on earth. And if this be a duty, then it is a duty to come into ſome method to render this practicable; but it is not practicable (as was ſhewn before) but by this method, or ſome other equivalent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 2. As to this particular method, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to promote union in extraordinary prayer, viz. God's people, in various parts, ſetting apart fixed ſeaſons, to return at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain periods, wherein they agree to offer up their prayers at the ſame time, it is not ſo new as ſome may poſſibly imagine. This
<pb n="307" facs="unknown:026594_0308_0FD0B41426F62EA0"/>may appear by what follows, which is part of a paper, diſperſed abroad in Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and Ireland, from London, in the year 1712, being the lat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="309" facs="unknown:026594_0310_0FD0B415C75F2178"/>kingdom, for a happy peace or ſucceſsful war, ſo long as the matter ſhall continue undetermined; for ſecuring the Proteſtant ſucceſſion in the illuſtrious houſe of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nover, (by good and evil wiſhes to which, the friends and enemies of our religion and civil rights, are ſo eſſentially diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,) and eſpecially for the influences of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace upon the riſing generation, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the ſeed of the righteous, that the offspring of our Chriſtian heroes may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be the plague of our church and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. And we deſire that this ſolemn pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er be begun the firſt Tueſday after ſight, and continued at leaſt the ſummer of this preſent year 1712. And we think, every modeſt, reaſonable and juſt requeſt, ſuch as this, ſhould not on any account be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied us, ſince we are not laying a burden on others, to which we will not moſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly put our own ſhoulders; nay, indeed, count it much more a bleſſing than a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. We hope this will not be eſteemed, by ſerious Proteſtants, of any denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a needleſs ſtep; much leſs do we fear being cenſured by any ſuch, as fanciful and melancholy, on account of ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal.

Let this counſel be acceptable to us, in this day of the church's calamity, and our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon fears. Let us ſeek the Lord white he may be found, and call upon him while be is near. Let us humble ourſelves under the mighty hand of God. Let us go and pray unto our God, and he will hearken unto us. We ſhall ſeek him and find him, when we ſearch for him with all our hearts. Pray for the peace of Juruſalem; they ſhall proſper that love her. And may Zion's friends and enemies both cry out with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, when they ſee the work of God—Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold they pray!—What hath God wrought!

God ſpeedily and wonderfully heard and anſwered thoſe who were united in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary prayer, propoſed in the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned paper, in ſuddenly ſcattering thoſe black clouds which threatened the nation and the Proteſtant intereſt with ruin, at that time; in bringing about, in ſo remarkable a manner, that happy change in the ſtate of affairs in the nation, which was after the queen's death, by the bringing in king George the Firſt. juſt at the time when the enemies of the religion and liberties of the nation had ripened their deſigns to be put in ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy execution. And we ſee in the beginning of this extract, this which is propoſed, is mentioned as being no new thing, but that God's people in Great Britain had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been called upon to the like duty, and had complied, and that not without ſucceſs. Such like concerts or agreements have ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times been propoſed in Scotland, before this which is now propoſed to us, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly there was a propoſal publiſhed for this very practice, in the year 1732, and another in 1735; ſo that it appears that this objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of novelty is built on a miſtake.</p>

                  <head>THE CONCLUSION.</head>
                  <p>And now, upon the whole, I deſire every
<pb n="312" facs="unknown:026594_0313_0FD0B4414A5C4478"/>ſerious Chriſtian, that may read this diſcourſe, calmly and deliberately to conſider whether he can excuſe himſelf from complying with what has been propoſed to us and requeſted of us, by thoſe miniſters of Chriſt in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, who are the authors of the late memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial. God has ſtirred up a part of his church, in a diſtant part of the world, to be in an extraordinary manner ſeeking and crying to him, that he would appear to favour Zion, as he has promiſed. And they are applying themſelves to us, to join with them, and make that very propoſal to us which is ſpoken of in my text, and in like manner and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. The members of one church, in one country, are coming to others, in other diſtant countries, ſaying <hi>Let us go ſpeedily and conſtantly to pray before the Lord, and to ſeek the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> Will it not become us readily to ſay, <hi>I will go alſo?</hi> What theſe ſervants of Chriſt aſk of us, is not ſilver or gold, or any of our outward ſubſtance, or that we would put ourſelves to any coſt, or do any thing that will be likely to expoſe us to any remarkable trouble, difficulty or ſuffering in our outward intereſt, but only that we would, help together with them, by our prayers to God, for the greateſt mercy
<pb n="313" facs="unknown:026594_0314_0FD0B418A70B5898"/>in the world, and that a mercy which as much concerns us as them, for the glory of their Lord and ours, for the great advancement of our common intereſt and happineſs, and the happineſs of our fellow-creatures through all nations; a mercy, which, at this day eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, there is great need of; a mercy, which we, in this land, do ſtand in p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>cular need of; a mercy, which the word of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires us to make the ſubject-matter of our prayers, above all other mercies, and gives us more encouragement to pray earneſtly and unitedly to him for, than any other mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and a mercy, which the providence of God towards the world of mankind, at this day, does loudly call the people of God to pray for. I think we cannot reaſonably doubt but that theſe miniſters have acted a part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming diſciples of the great Meſſiah, and miniſters of his kingdom, and have done the will of God, and according to his word, in ſetting forward ſuch an affair at this day, and in propoſing it to us; and therefore I deſire it may be conſidered, whether we ſhall not really ſin againſt God, in refuſing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with their propoſal and requeſt, or in neglecting it, and turning it by, with but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="314" facs="unknown:026594_0315_0FD0B442A5F75470"/>notice and attention, therein diſregard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which is truly a call of God to us.</p>
                  <p>The miniſters that make this propoſal to us, are no ſeparatiſts or ſchiſmatics, promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of no public diſorders, nor of any wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or extravagance in matters of religion, but are quiet and peaceable members and miniſters of the church of Scotland, that have lamented the late diviſions and breach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of that church. If any ſhall ſay, that they are under no advantage to judge of their character, but muſt take it on truſt from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, becauſe they conceal their names; in anſwer to this, I would ſay, That I preſume no ſober perſon will ſay that he has any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſuſpect them, to be any other than gentlemen of honeſt intention. Beſure there is no appearance of any thing elſe, but an upright deſign in their propoſal, and that they have not mentioned their names, is an argument of it. It may well be preſumed, from the manner of their expreſſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in the memorial itſelf, they conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their names from that, which, perhaps, may be called an exceſs of modeſty, chuſing to be at the greateſt diſtance from appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſet forth themſelves to the view of the world, as the heads of a great affair, and the
<pb n="315" facs="unknown:026594_0316_0FD0B41A2780D6B8"/>firſt projectors and movers of ſomething ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, that they deſire ſhould become general, and that God's people, in various diſtant parts of the world, ſhould agree in. And therefore, they are moreover careful to tell us, that they do not propoſe the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, as now ſetting it on foot, but as a thing already ſet on foot, and do not tell us who firſt projected and moved it. The propoſal is made to us in a very proper and prudent manner, with all appearance of Chriſtian modeſty and ſincerity, and with a very pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent guard againſt and thing that looks like ſuperſtition, or whatſoever might entangle a tender conſcience, and far from any appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a deſign to promote any particular party or denomination of Chriſtians, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to others, but with all appearance to the contrary, in their charitable requeſt, that none would, by any means, conceive of any ſuch thing to be in their view, and that all, of every denomination and opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the late religious commotions, would join with them, in ſeeking the common inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of the kingdom of Chriſt; and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I think, none can be in the way of their duty, in neglecting a propoſal in itſelf excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and that which they have reaſon to
<pb n="316" facs="unknown:026594_0317_0FD0B444687DB130"/>think is made with upright intentions, mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe the propoſers modeſtly conceal their names. I do not ſee how any ſerious perſon, that has an ill opinion of late reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſtirs, can have any colour of reaſon to refuſe a compliance with this propoſal, on that account; the more diſorders, extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies and deluſions of the devil have late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prevailed, the more need have we to pray earneſtly to God, for his Holy Spirit, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote true religion, in oppoſition to the grand deceiver, and all his works; and the more ſuch prayer, as is propoſed, is anſwered, the more effectually will all that is contrary to ſober and pure religion be extirpated and exploded</p>
                  <p>One would think that every one who fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours the duſt of Zion, when he hears that God is ſtirring up a conſiderable number of his miniſters and people, to unite in extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary prayer, for the revival of religion and advancement of his kingdom, ſhould greatly rejoice on this occaſion. If we lay to heart the preſent calamities of the church of Chriſt, and long for that bleſſed altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which God has promiſed, one would think it ſhould be natural to rejoice at the appearance of ſomething in ſo dark a day,
<pb n="317" facs="unknown:026594_0318_0FD0B41BB5DCDD38"/>which is ſo promiſing a token. Would not our friends that were lately in captivity in Canada, who earneſtly longed for deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, have rejoiced to have heard of any thing that ſeemed to forebode the approach of their redemption? And particularly may we not ſuppoſe ſuch of them as were religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſons, would greatly have rejoiced to have underſtood that there was ſtirred up in God's people an extraordinary ſpirit of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for their redemption? And I do not know why it would not be as natural for us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice at the like hopeful token of the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Zion, if we made her intereſt our own, and preferred Jeruſalem above our chief joy.</p>
                  <p>If we are indeed called of God to comply with the propoſal now made to us, then let me beſeech all that do ſincerely love the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of real Chriſtianity, not withſtanding any diverſity of opinion, and former diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, now to unite in this affair, with one heart and voice—and <hi>let us go ſpeedily to pray before the Lord.</hi> There is no need that one ſhould wait for another. If we can get others, that are our neighbours, to join with us, and ſo can conveniently ſpend the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ſeaſons with praying ſocieties, this is deſirable; but if not, why ſhould we wholly
<pb n="318" facs="unknown:026594_0319_0FD0B445C6F718A8"/>neglect the duty propoſed? Why ſhould not we perform it by ourſelves, uniting in heart and practice, as far as we are able, with thoſe who, in diſtant places, are engaged in that duty at that time?</p>
                  <p>If it be agreeable to the mind and will of God, that we ſhould comply with the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, by praying for the coming of Chriſt's kingdom, in the manner therein propoſed, then doubtleſs it is the duty of all to comply with the memorial, in that reſpect alſo, viz. in endeavouring, as far as in us lies, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote others joining in ſuch prayer, and to render this union and agreement as exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive as may be. Private Chriſtians may have many advantages and opportunities for this; but eſpecially miniſters, inaſmuch as they not only are by office overſeers of whole congregations of God's people, and their guides in matters of religion, but ordinarily have a far more extenſive acquaintance and influence abroad, than private Chriſtians in common have.</p>
                  <p>And I hope that ſuch as are convinced it is their duty to comply with and encourage this de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>gn, will remember we ought not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to go ſpeedily to pray before the Lord, and to ſeek his mercy, but alſo to go con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly.
<pb n="319" facs="unknown:026594_0320_0FD0B41D2D150400"/>We ſhould unite in our practice theſe two things, which our Saviour unites in his precept, praying and not fainting. If we ſhould continue ſome years, and nothing remarkable in Providence ſhould appear, as though God heard and anſwered, we ſhould act very unbecoming believers, if we ſhould therefore begin to be diſheartened, and grow dull and ſlack, in our ſeeking of God ſo great a mercy. It is very apparent from the word of God, that God is wont often to try the faith and patience of his people, when cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him for ſome great and important mercy, by with-holding the mercy ſought, for a ſeaſon, and not only ſo, but at firſt to cauſe an increaſe of dark appearances, and yet, without fail, at laſt, to ſucceed thoſe who continue inſtant in prayer with all perſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and will not let God go except he bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. It is now propoſed that this extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary united prayer ſhould continue for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven years, from November, 1746. Perhaps ſome that appear forward to engage, may begin to think the time long, before the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven years are out, and may account it a dull ſtory, to go on, for ſo long a time, praying in this extraordinary method, while all yet continues dark and dead, without any dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="320" facs="unknown:026594_0321_0FD0B4472673B448"/>of the wiſhed-for light, or new promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appearance in Providence of the ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r approach of the deſired mercy. But let it be conſidered, whether it will not be a poor buſineſs, if our faith and patience is ſo ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winded, that we cannot be willing to wait upon God one ſeven years, in a way of tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this little pains, in ſeeking a mercy ſo infinitely vaſt. For my part, I ſincerely wiſh and hope, that there may not be an end of extraodinary united prayer, among God's people, for the effuſions of the bleſſed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, when the ſeven years are ended, but that it will be continued, either in this method, or ſome other, by a new agreement, that will be entered into, with greater engaged<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and more abundant alacrity, than this is; and that extraordinary united prayer for ſuch a mercy will be further propagated and extended, than it can be expected to be in one ſeven years. But yet, at the ſame time, I hope, God's people, that unite in this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, will ſee ſome tokens for good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe ſeven years are out, that ſhall give them to ſee, that God has not ſaid to the ſeed of Jacob—Seek ye me in vain; and ſhall ſerve greatly to animate and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them to go on in united prayers for the
<pb n="321" facs="unknown:026594_0322_0FD0B41ECC499D58"/>advancement of Chriſt's kingdom, with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing fervency. But whatever our hopes may be in this reſpect, we muſt be content to be ignorant of the times and ſeaſons, which the Father hath put in his own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and muſt be willing that God ſhould anſwer prayer, and fulfil his own glorious promiſes, in his own time; remembering ſuch inſtructions, counſels and promiſes of the word of God as theſe—<hi>Wait on the Lord, be of Good courage, and he ſhall ſtrengthen thine heart; wait, I ſay, on the Lord. For the viſion is yet for an appointed time; but in the end it will ſpeak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it, becauſe it will ſurely come, it will not tarry. I will look unto the Lord, I will wait for the God of my ſalvat <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And it ſhall be ſaid in that day, Lo, this is our God! we have waited for him, and he will ſave us: This is</hi> JEHOVAH! <hi>we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his ſalvation.</hi> Amen.</p>

                  <p>For any ſentiments obſerved to be omitted, the reader is referred to the tenor of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding diſcourſes; and if any ſhould be ready to ſay, that proofs and illuſtrations are need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsly multiplied, it may not be improper to anſwer, that on the ſubject of prophecy, as well as in reſpect to every other, the truth gains in proportion to the evidence by which it is atteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and ſhines much brighter whilſt ſupported by a cloud of approved witneſſes, than whilſt reſting on the opinion of any ſingle interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

                  <p>IN all the calamities which it pleaſes God to bring upon his enemies, or upon the enemies of his church, all holy beings have cauſe to rejoice. The ground of their joy, in ſuch events, however awful to the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, is founded in the reaſon and nature of things as well as in the expreſs appointment and call of God.</p>
                  <p>The cauſe of God in heaven, and the cauſe of Chriſt and of his church on the earth are one and the ſame: and ſo far as either the former or the latter, or both unitedly, may be employed, in their uſual methods of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="328" facs="unknown:026594_0326_0FD0B448A7AC4BB8"/>the purpoſes of the Grand Adverſary or of his inſtruments; in the ſame degree may the ſtruggle be ſtiled a common cauſe, or a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral war. The enemies of God are the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of his church, and they who ſeek the overthrow of the latter, would, if poſſible, dethrone the former. On this account, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it is, that all holy beings, whether in the heaven of heavens, on high, or whether in the heavens of the Chriſtian church, (for ſo, in prophetic ſtile, the word ſometimes ſignifies,) are called upon to rejoice at the calamities which God, in judgment for their ſins, brings on his enemies, and on the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of his Zion.</p>
                  <p>All holy beings have cauſe to rejoice in the downfall of the wicked, as ſuch a diſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, under the management of heaven, may tend to the upbuilding of the kingdom of Chriſt, and of the truth in the world. By ſuch events victory is, renewedly, aſcribed to God. The faith and hope of the pious are revived and confirmed.—That ſuch effects, by ſuch diſaſters upon the wicked, have been produced, the ſcriptures plainly teach.

The Lord is my ſtrength and ſong, and he is become my ſalvation: he is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my father's God, and I will exalt him. The Lord is a man of war: the Lord is his name.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not only is the confidence of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous maintained by ſuch diſplays of vindic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive power, but the ſame events load, with increaſing danger, the intereſts of Satan and of the wicked in general.</p>
                  <p>To revive the intereſts of truth and of grace—to ſupport the cauſe of God in the boſoms of the righteous, and to accumulate the degrees of danger, apprehenſion and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal deſtruction, on the part of the wicked, have no doubt been important, if not lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing objects to be accompliſhed, in all the denunciations and executions which, in all ages, have been, in a higher or leſs degree, emptied forth upon the wicked, from the vials of the divine indignation.</p>
                  <p>In purſuance of the ſame important ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, a call is iſſued, on a mighty and ſolemn
<pb n="330" facs="unknown:026594_0328_0FD0B44A75B56B90"/>occaſion, to all friends to God, and to his government to rejoice. <hi>Rejoice over her thou heaven, and ye holy apoſtles and prophets, for God hath avenged you on her.</hi>

                  <p>And will a very gracious God ſo enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the mind, both of the ſpeaker and of the hearers, that truths may be opened, impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions made, and effects wrought anſwerable to the nature and import of ſo ſolemn and momentous a ſubject.—I am,</p>
                  <p n="1">I. To ſhew who it is over whoſe deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or downfall, all holy beings are called upon to rejoice.</p>
                  <p>For his knowledge we muſt repair to the firſt and ſecond verſes of the context. <hi>And after theſe things,</hi> ſaith the inſpired apoſtle, <hi>I ſaw another angel come down from heaven,
<pb n="331" facs="unknown:026594_0329_0FD0B42626DB3460"/>having great power, and the earth was light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened with his glory. And he cried mightily with a ſtrong voice, ſaying,</hi> BABYLON THE GREAT IS FALLEN, IS FALLEN.</p>
                  <p>It is very generally, if not unanimouſly, agreed by Proteſtant writers, that by Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, as uſed in this place, you are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the extenſive, once triumphant, and perſecuting power of anti-chriſtian Papal Rome, ſtiled BABYLON, becauſe there are ſo many appendages to this idolatrous power, which ſo nearly reſemble, and ſo exactly anſwer the prophetic deſcription of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, of the Chaldees—the inveterate the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, and, for a ſeaſon, the ſucceſsful ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the people of God, in ancient time.</p>
                  <p>Figures of ſpeech, eſpecially in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetic parts, are very frequent in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Indeed, almoſt the whole of this book of <hi>the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt which God gave unto him, to ſhew unto his ſervants things which muſt ſhortly come to paſs,</hi> is made up of figures. Sometimes, leſt the figure ſhould be unintelligible, the angel ſent to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate the very intereſting intelligence of this invaluable book, explains the figure.— And ſometimes the prophetic herald gives a different view of the ſame object in differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="332" facs="unknown:026594_0330_0FD0B44BAB3CE0D0"/>figures. Of this method we have an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in the ſubject before us.</p>
                  <p>Papal Rome, here ſtiled BABYLON THE GREAT, in the chapter preceding is called, becauſe of her idolatrous practices, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of her forſaking her original faithful Lord and Huſband—the GREAT WHORE: And that it might be known to be the ſame power, as is here deſcribed, the word Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon is annexed or interwoven with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther characters of this myſtical harlot. This fact will be yet more clear if you liſten to the teſtimony itſelf. <hi>So he carried me away in the ſpirit into the wilderneſs: and I ſaw a woman ſit upon a ſcarlet-coloured beaſt, full of names of blaſphemy, having ſeven heads and ten horns. And the woman was arrayed in purple and ſcarlet-colour, and decked with gold, and precious ſtones, and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand, full of abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſilthineſs of her fornication. And upon her forehead was a name written,</hi> MYS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.</p>
                  <p>In ſupporting the alluſion, or in running the parallel between ancient heatheniſh and modern anti-chriſtian Papal Babylon, you
<pb n="333" facs="unknown:026594_0331_0FD0B427A8E281C8"/>will permit, that I but touch upon the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent branches of ſimilarity, leaving the more full illuſtration to be ſupplied by your own recollection and ſtudy.</p>
                  <p>As in the prophetic writings the words Jeruſalem, Zion, the Temple of the living God, &amp;c. are uſed to expreſs the ſtate of the church under the Jewiſh, ſo the ſame words are ſometimes applied to expreſs the ſtate and character of the church under the Chriſtian diſpenſation. On the other hand, as Sodom, Egypt and Babylon were names given to the enemies of God, and of his church, in ancient time, ſo, under the ſame names, their ſucceſſors are ſet forth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed as to exiſt in later times.</p>
                  <p>All theſe dark ſhades of national charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and many more, did time allow, might be proved to be, with juſtice, applicable to this anti-chriſtian power of Papal Rome.— To Sodom this power may be likened for her ſin, and to Egypt for her darkneſs, ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry and oppreſſion. And, without doubt, by the angel of God, in his addreſs to St. John on the ſubject of the ſlaughter of the witneſſes, theſe dark ſhades are applied to this tyrannical dominion. <hi>And their dead bodies ſhall lie in the ſtreet of the great city,
<pb n="334" facs="unknown:026594_0332_0FD0B44DC29291C0"/>which ſpiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where, alſo, our Lord was crucified.</hi> On theſe words, ſaith an approved commentator<note n="*" place="bottom">But kit in loco.</note>— <q>The place where this was done is ſtiled Sodom and Egypt, and the <hi>great city where our Lord was crucified;</hi> which, if literally underſtood, ſignifies Jeruſalem, but if myſtically underſtood, ROME, or the Roman empire.</q>—And no one, I may add, will ſuppoſe it is perverting the prophetic emblem, if it be applied, ſolely, to Rome; eſpecially, if it be recollected, that as Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem was the head of the Jewiſh, ſo Rome profeſſes to be the head of the Chriſtian em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; and alſo, that the once crucifying of our Lord at Jeruſalem, is but a faint emblem of the thouſand crucifixions he has ſince un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone in the multiplied perſecutions and tortures of the members of his myſtical bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and, I may add, which he ſtill under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes in the daily offerings, the myſtical ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, the ſuperſtitious maſſes of the church of Rome.</p>
                  <p>Hear, alſo, to this point, the teſtimony of a late very reſpectable writer on the ſubject of prophecy.<note n="†" place="bottom">Langdon in loco.</note> 
                     <q>As to the great city, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<pb n="335" facs="unknown:026594_0333_0FD0B4292698AD20"/>under the figurative names of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Egypt, and compared alſo to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, where our Lord was crucified, we ſhall find by following viſions that Rome, with its empire, is meant. It is called So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, on account of the abominable crimes committed in it, Egypt, on account of abounding ſuperſtition and idolatry, and the cruel bon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ge in which it holds the people of God: And it is compared to Jeruſalem, being ſaid to be the city where our Lord was crucified; becauſe while it pretended to be an holy city, it had killed the prophets and ſaints, and crucified Chriſt afreſh in his members. Here it may be more eſpecially obſerved, that as in the beginning of the chapter the temple is the emblem of the Chriſtian church, that city, with its empire, in which the church is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, may very properly be compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Jeruſalem, the city in which the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh temple ſtood: And as our Lord was crucified within the juriſdiction of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man empire, and by the Roman authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the Papal empire has ſucceeded to the other, and claims an equal extent, there is a propriety in ſaying that our Lord was crucified in the great city Rome, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="336" facs="unknown:026594_0334_0FD0B44EA796A8A8"/>in connexion with the empire of which it is the capital.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having laid this foundation as to the uſe and application of prophetic figures, to which much might be added, were it neceſſary, the way is plain to proceed with my ſubject, in an attempt to ſhew, that by BABYLON THE GREAT, whoſe fall is predicted in the text, is meant the preſent anti-chriſtian power of Papal Rome.</p>
                  <p>This fact will, at once, appear moſt pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably evident, if, with attention, you are pleaſed to follow me in a conſideration of the ſeveral articles of analogy, between anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and modern Babylon, deſigned to juſtify the prophetic alluſion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Did Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, <hi>ſet up an image,</hi> and call upon the ſubjects of his empire to fall down and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip it, ſo hath the Nebuchadnezzar of the Church of Rome, ſupported by the magi of his kingdom, ſet up, and continued to ſet up images innumerable, to which the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of bowing and kneeling is continually paid in churches, in many public places, and even on the common country roads, by the ſubjects of this myſtical empire, as is well known to thoſe who have paſſed through this idolatrous country.</p>

2. Did the decree of the king of Babylon enjoin homage to this image on pain of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing caſt <hi>into the midſt of a burning fiery fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace;</hi> ſo doth the church of Rome enjoin homage to her idols on pain of excluſion from her communion, with the tortures of the inquiſition in this world, and the pains of purgatory and damnation in the next.<note n="*" place="bottom">The Author once had his own hat knocked off by the bayo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net of a ſoldier, belonging to a party who eſcorted and protected a Biſhop and his confederates, during a very thronged proceſſion, at Nantes, becauſe he would not do cuſtomary homage at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Hoſt, which was carried along the ſtreets, claiming re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious homage, during the farcical exhibitions on the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Fète de Dieu.</note>

So that Antichriſt has proved the greateſt and moſt cruel enemy the church of Chriſt ever had; agreeable to the deſcription given of the church of Rome. <hi>And I ſaw the woman drunken with the blood of the ſaints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jeſus.— And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of ſaints, and of all them that were ſlain upon the earth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The heathen perſecutions had been very dreadful; but now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, by the church of Rome, was improved, and ſtudied, and cultivated as an art or ſcience. Such methods of tormenting were found out, that were beyond the invention of former ages. And, that cerſecution might be managed more effectually, there were certain ſocieties eſtabliſhed in various parts of the Popiſh domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, whoſe buſineſs it ſhould be to ſtudy, improve, and practiſe perſecution in its higheſt perfection, which are called the courts of inquiſition.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                              <p>Theſe infernal tribunals were firſt erected in the twelfth cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury by the infamous Father Dominic, under the patronage of Pope Innocent III. in order more completely to extirpate the Waldenſes, and other pretended heretics. It is difficult to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that if God had delivered the world entirely into the Devil's hands, (as Satan once pretended) that his ingenuity and malice could have invented any thing more deteſtable and ſhocking.

                              <p>When the Reformation began, the beaſt with ſeven heads and ten horns began to rage in a dreadful manner. After the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, the church of Rome renewed its perſecution of the poor Waldenſes, and great multitudes of them were cruelly tortured and put to death. Soon after the Reformation, there were alſo terrible perſecutions in various parts of Germany, and eſpecially in Bohemia, which laſted for thirty years together, in which ſo much blood was ſhed for the ſake of religion, that a certain writer compares it to the plenty of waters of the great rivers of Germany. The countries of Poland, Lithuania, and Hungary were, in like manner, deluged with Proteſtant blood.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                                    <p>If Rome <hi>Pagan</hi> hath ſlain her thouſands of innocent Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, Rome <hi>Chriſtian</hi> hath ſlain her ten thouſands. For, not to mention other outrageous ſlaughters and barbarities, the croiſades againſt the Waldenſes and Albigenſes, the murders committed by the Duke of Alva in the Netherlands, the maſſacres in France and Ireland, will probably amount to above ten times the number of all the Chriſtians ſlain in all the ten perſecutions of the Roman emperors put together."</p>

                                    <p>Alſo Holland, and the other low countries, were, for many years, a ſcene of nothing but the moſt affecting and amazing cruelties, being deluged with the blood of Proteſtants, under the mercileſs hands of the Spaniards, to whom they were then in ſubjection.— But in this perſecution the Devil in a great meaſure failed of his purpoſe, as it iſſued in a great part of the Netherlands caſting off the Spaniſh yoke, and ſetting up a wealthy and powerful Proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant ſtate, to the great defence of the Proteſtant cauſe ever ſince.</p>
                                    <p>France alſo is another country which, ſince the Reformation, in ſome reſpects, perhaps, more than any other, has been a ſcene of dreadful cruelties ſuffered by the Proteſtants there. After many cruelties had been exerciſed towards the Proteſtants in that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, there was begun a perſecution of them in the year 1571, in the reign of Charles the IX. king of France.</p>
                                    <p>It began with a cruel maſſacre, wherein ſeventy thouſand Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants were ſlain in a few days time, as the king boaſted; and in all this perſecution, he ſlew, as is ſuppoſed, three hundred thouſand martyrs. And it is reckoned, that about this time, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thirty years, there were martyred in this kingdom, for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant religion, thirty-nine princes, one hundred and forty-eight counts, two hundred and thirty-four barons, one hundred and forty-ſeven thouſand five hundred and eighteen gentlemen, and ſeven hundred and ſixty thouſand of the common people.</p>
                                    <p>The Pariſian maſſacre was aggravated with ſeveral circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of wantonneſs and treachery; but we hope that the above num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are exaggerated. Thuanus, their own hiſtorian, reckons thirty thouſand lives deſtroyed in this ſlaughter; but Proteſtant anthors ſeem to have reaſon for ſuppoſing them not leſs than one hundred thouſand in the whole. But the moſt horrid circumſtance in the hiſtory is, that when the news of this event reached Rome, Pope Gregory XIII. inſtituted the moſt ſolemn rejoicings, giving thanks to Almighty God for this glorious victory!!!—An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that has no parallel, even in hell.</p>
                                    <p>But all theſe perſecutions were, for exquiſite cruelty, far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by thoſe which followed in the reign of Lewis XIV. which, indeed, are ſuppoſed to exceed all others that ever have been; and being long continued by reaſon of the long reign of that king, almoſt wholly extirpated the Proteſtant religion out of that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, where had been before a multitude of famous Proteſtant churches all over the country.<note n="*" place="bottom">

                                             <hi>The Perſecution under Lewis XIV.</hi>—This followed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of the Edict of Nantes, A. D. 1685. The following ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract is taken from a French work of reputation.</p>
                                          <p>"The troopers, ſoldiers and dragoons went into the Proteſtants' houſes, where they marred and defaced their houſehold ſtuff, broke their looking-glaſſes, and other utenſils and ornaments, let their wine run about their cellars, and threw about their corn, and ſpoilet it. And as to thoſe things which they could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy in this manner, ſuch as furniture of beds, linen, wearing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, plate, &amp;c. they carried them to the market place, and ſold them to the Jeſuits and other Roman Catholics. By theſe means the Proteſtants in Montaubon alone were, in four or five days, ſtripped of above a million of money. But this was not the worſt.</p>
                                          <p>"They turned the dining-rooms of gentlemen into ſtables for their horſes, and treated the owners of the houſes where they quartered with the higheſt indignity and cruelty, laſhing them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout from one to another, day and night, without intermiſſion, not ſuffering them to eat or drink; and when they began to ſink under the fatigue and pains they had undergone, they laid them on a bed, and when they thought them ſomewhat recovered, made them riſe, and repeated the ſame tortures. When they ſaw the blood and ſweat run down their faces and other parts of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, they ſluiced them with water; and putting over their heads kettle-drums, turned upſide down, they made a continual din upon them till thoſe unhappy creatures loſt their ſenſes. When one party of theſe tormentors were weary they were relieved by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who practiſed the ſame cruelties with freſh vigor.</p>
                                          <p>At Negrepliſſe, a town near Montaubon, they hung up Iſaac Favin, a Proteſtant citizen of that place, by his arm-pits, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented him a whole night by pinching and tearing off his fleſh with pincers. They made a great fire round a boy about twelve years old, who, with hands and eyes lifted up to heaven, cried out— "My God, help me!"—And when they found the youth reſolved to die rather than renounce his religion, they ſnatched him from the ſire juſt as he was on the point of being burnt.</p>
                                          <p>"In ſeveral places the ſoldiers applied red hot irons to the hands and feet of men, and the breaſts of women. At Nantes they hung up ſeveral women and maids by their feet, and others by their arm-pits, and thus expoſed them to public view ſtark-naked. They bound mothers that gave ſuck to poſts, and let their ſucking infants lie languiſhing in their ſight for ſeveral days and nights, crying, mourning and gaſping for life. Some they bound before a great ſire, and, being half roaſted, let them go—a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment worſe than death. Amidſt a thouſand hideous cries, and a thouſand blaſphemies, they hung up men and women by the hair, and ſome by their feet, on hooks in chimneys, and ſmoaked them with wiſps of wet hay till they were ſuffocated. They tied ſome under the arms with ropes, and plunged them again and again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to wells. They bound others like criminals, put them to the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and with a funnel filled them with wine, till the fumes of it took away their reaſon, when they made them ſay they conſented to be Catholics. They ſtripped them naked, and, after a thouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and indignities, ſtuck them with pins and needles from bead to foot. They cut and ſlaſhed them with knives, and ſometimes with red-hot pincers took hold of them by the noſe and other parts of the body, and dragged them about the rooms till they made them promiſe to be Catholics, or till the cries of theſe miſerable wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, calling upon God for help, forced them to let them go. They beat them with ſtaves, and thus bruiſed, and with broken bones, dragged them to church, where their forced preſence was taken for an abjuration. In ſome places they tied fathers and huſbands to their bed-poſts, and, before their eyes, ravaged their wives and daughters with impunity. They blew up men and women with bellows till they burſt them. If any, to eſcape theſe barbarities, endeavoured to ſave themſelves by flight, they purſued them into the fields and woods, where they ſhot them like wild beaſts, and prohibited them from departing the kingdom, (a cruelty never practiſed by Nero or Diocleſian) upon pain of confiſcation of ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, the gallies, the laſh, and perpetual impriſonment; inſomuch that the priſons of the ſea port towns were crammed with men, women and children, who endeavoured to ſave themſelves by flight from this dreadful perſecution. With theſe ſcenes of deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and horror, the popiſh clergy feaſted their eyes, and made only a matter of laughter and ſport of them."</p>

                                             <hi>Other cruelties.</hi>—Beſide the Proteſtant blood ſhed in theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, Popery has to anſwer for the lives of millions of Jews, Mahometans, and barbarians. When the Moors conquered Spain in the eighth century, they allowed the Chriſtians the free exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their religion. But in the fifteenth century, when the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles were turned, and Ferdinand ſubdued the Moriſcoes, (the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendants of the above Moors) many hundred thouſands of them were forced to be baptized, or burnt, maſſacred, or baniſhed, and their children ſold for ſlaves; beſides an innumerable multitude of Jews, who ſhared the ſame cruelties, chiefly by means of the infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Inquiſition. A worſe ſlaughter, if poſſible, was made among the natives of Spaniſh America, where fifteen millions are ſaid to have been ſacrificed to the genius of Popery in the courſe of about forty years. Well, therefore, might the inſpired apoſtle ſay, that at myſtic Babylon's deſtruction—<hi>In her was found the blood of prophets, and of ſaints, and of all that were ſlain upon the earth!</hi> Rev. xviii. 24—[See Edwards's Hiſtory of Redemption, with notes, page 452, 459, of the London, or new American edition.]</p>

5. Was ancient Babylon a ſcourge to the people of God, and did ſhe bring them into
<pb n="343" facs="unknown:026594_0341_0FD0B47729FBE4F0"/>a ſeventy years captivity? ſo this anti-chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian power hath been a ſcourge to the true worſhippers of God in modern times, and hath had a great part of the Chriſtian church
<pb n="344" facs="unknown:026594_0342_0FD0B45543D6AA80"/>in more than Egyptian bondage for twelve hundred years.</p>
                  <p>During this bondage it is that the TWO WITNESSES—the <hi>few</hi> faithful, who, in every age, have teſtified to the truth; (as ſome have ſuppoſed) but if ſo, there may be alſo an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion, and perhaps a primary one, to the TWO OLIVE TREES of the prophet's viſion, <hi>the anointed ones that ſtand by the Lord of the whole earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The olive tree afforded light from its fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and nouriſhment from its fruit. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, therefore, the purport of the TWO WITNESSES, as explained by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, to be the two OLIVE TREES, and the TWO CANDLESTICKS, <hi>ſtanding before the God of the earth,</hi> I am rather inclined to think, that they have a more extenſive, myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, and important meaning than what they have been generally underſtood to imply. If the olive trees and candleſticks were an emblem of ſpiritual and divine communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions during their ſtanding in the Jewiſh, what ſhould hinder the ſame application whilſt they ſtand in the Chriſtian church?</p>
                  <p>As the gifts and graces ſhed down upon the miniſters of our bleſſed Lord, and upon his churches, after his aſcenſion, were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="345" facs="unknown:026594_0343_0FD0B403AAB90EB8"/>to have been typified or preſigured by the anointing and common oil of the ſanctuary; ſo the olive tree as giving light and heat, and, I may add, nouriſhment too, was found in the uſage and appointment of heaven, no unbecoming repreſentation or emblem of thoſe ſpiritual communications which were then ſhed upon the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers, and which will ever be continued as long as Chriſt is the vine, or true olive, and his people the needy branches.</p>
                  <p>May we not then ſuppoſe, that by theſe TWO OLIVE TREES and the TWO CANDLE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STICKS, <hi>ſtanding before the God of the earth,</hi> is meant the <hi>ſources</hi> of divine and ſpiritual ſupplies to his church, the <hi>medium</hi> of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, or methods of <hi>outward</hi> and <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen exhibition;</hi> or ſhall we ſay, that the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem may partake a little of each, and ſtand a lively figure of them all?</p>
                  <p>If you aſk how this interpretation can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with the epithet, with their being called <hi>witneſſes,</hi> it may be anſwered, they are juſtly and literally ſo to be ſtiled. Are not the word of God preached, and his ordinances adminiſtered, by his faithful miniſters, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to be ſtiled WITNESSES for God?—
<pb n="346" facs="unknown:026594_0344_0FD0B45625134D70"/>And if you chooſe to retain the number <hi>two,</hi> may we not ſay the <hi>ſpirit</hi> and the <hi>word,</hi> with their uſual and outward methods of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, are ſignified; or ſay the word, and the ordinances of God in general, or the whole exhibition of the teſtimony of God, whether in things inward and ſpiritual, or in things outward and viſible?</p>
                  <p>With this interpretation agrees well the idea of their propheſying <hi>in ſackcloth;</hi> for no one can pretend, but the adminiſtration of the word and worſhip of God, in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh church, is ſo beclouded by ignorance, ſtiled darkneſs; by ſuperſtition and error, and by the miniſtry of a corrupt prieſthood, as to lay juſt foundation to ſay, that the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, with this interpretation, are empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically propheſying in ſackcloth.</p>
                  <p>With the ſame idea conſiſts, very exactly, the <hi>term</hi> of time in which theſe witneſſes are appointed to propheſy:—It is during the whole reign of Antichriſt, the forty-two months, or twelve hundred and ſixty years. <hi>And I will give,</hi> or appoint, <hi>unto my two wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,</hi> and <hi>they ſhall propheſy a thouſand two hundred and three ſcore days, clothed in ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>With the ſame interpretation agrees the
<pb n="347" facs="unknown:026594_0345_0FD0B478F5F4CA38"/>declaration or expoſition of the angel in the next verſe. <hi>Theſe are the</hi> TWO OLIVE TREES <hi>and the</hi> TWO CANDLESTICKS <hi>ſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the God of the earth.</hi> And, in fact, there ſeems nothing in the chapter but what may, with as great apparent truth; be reconciled to this interpretation, as to any other; and there are ſome things in it which cannot, with eaſe, be interpreted as applicable to the witneſſes, in any other ſenſe, underſtood or explained.</p>
                  <p>And if any ſhould be diſpoſed to believe, that the preſent reigning perſecuting infidel power, now waging war againſt all revealed religion, in France, is likely to be the <hi>death</hi> of theſe ſame witneſſes, who, for a long time, have already been made to propheſy in ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth, perhaps the opinion may find ſupport from the declaration of the angel: <hi>And when they ſhall have finiſhed their teſtimony, the beaſt that aſcendeth out of the bottomleſs pit, ſhall make war againſt them, and ſhall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them, and kill them.</hi> If this interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation be true, the mourning witneſſes are now ſuffering death in thoſe parts of myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Babylon, where the exiſting exterminat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power has prevailed.</p>
                  <p>Did time allow, and was the preſent a
<pb n="348" facs="unknown:026594_0346_0FD0B4588D878BF8"/>proper place in the order of my diſcourſe, I might expound upon the whole chapter, and eaſily reconcile any expreſſions which, at firſt view, might appear intricate, or doubtful, to the ſpirit of this interpretation. Suffice it, for the preſent, to ſay, that with this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation agrees well the declaration made reſpecting the injury theſe witneſſes are able to do their enemies. <hi>And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies.</hi> And of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhort of the adminiſtration of Heaven can it be ſaid: <hi>Theſe have power to ſhut hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that it rain not in the days of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy.</hi> And of nothing ſhort of this can it be ſaid—<hi>They have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to ſmite the earth with all plagues as often as they will.</hi> And very cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent to the death of the witneſſes, and to the lying of their dead bodies in the <hi>ſtreet of the great city,</hi> is the death, the broken and demoliſhed ſtate of external religion in thoſe parts of Papal Rome, in which the preſent exterminating power hath prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And equally correſpondent is the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that <hi>they of the people, and tongues, and nations;</hi> probably thoſe nations and churches out of the communion of the church of Rome,
<pb n="349" facs="unknown:026594_0347_0FD0B47A7714FF78"/>
                     <hi>ſhall ſee their dead bodies three days and an half, and,</hi> by a more lively adminiſtration of the word and ordinances of God, <hi>ſhall not ſuffer their dead bodies to be put in graves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And over the death of theſe witneſſes it is, that the men of this world <hi>ſhall rejoice, and make merry, and ſhall ſend gifts one to another; becauſe theſe two prophets torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them that dwelt on the earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the reſurrection and final exaltation of theſe witneſſes well applies the verſes ſucceeding. <hi>And after three days and an half, the ſpirit of life from God entered into them, and they ſtood upon their feet, and great fear fell upon them that ſaw them. And they heard a great voice from heaven, ſaying unto them—Come up hither. And they aſcended up to heaven in a cloud, and their enemies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held them.</hi> During theſe events it is ſaid—<hi>And the ſame hour was there an earthquake.</hi> May it not mean the earthquake now <hi>begun</hi>—the preſent convulſions amongſt the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, (for ſo in prophetic ſtile the word ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies) which are to be ſucceeded by the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening of the temple of God in heaven. <hi>And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was ſeen, in his temple, the ark of his teſtament; and there were lightnings, and voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="350" facs="unknown:026594_0348_0FD0B459E5DB19E0"/>and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And to conclude the argument, we are always to remember, that no interpretation of this myſtical paſſage can be allowed, which does not grant to the witneſſes an exiſtence, and a teſtimony during the whole term of the anti-chriſtian dominion. <hi>And I will give,</hi> or appoint, <hi>unto my two witneſſes, and they ſhall propheſy a thouſand two hundred and threeſcore days, clothed in ſackcloth.</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">If any ſhould be diſpoſed to ſay, this interpretation does not altogether accord with what the Editor has ſuffered to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in a preceding part of this volume; and that he is charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with inaccuracy, in this particular; it may ſuffice to anſwer, that the preſent being an interpretation ſo far new, (though al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready two years in manuſcript) that the Editor could not, until within a few days, warrant himſelf in preaching, or in publiſhing the ſentiment; therefore permitted the former interpretation to paſs,—which, however, with ſome abatement for the time in which it was written, muſt be allowed to be of no ſmall teſtimony to the truth, taken in a general and extenſive point of view.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the foregoing interpretation be true, have we not a ready anſwer to the queſtion, "How is it that there is ſo great dearth of religion in our churches, in our land, and in the world at the preſent time?"—May we not anſwer—Is not the preſent the dark pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, towards which our forefathers have been looking, and which they have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
<pb n="351" facs="unknown:026594_0349_0FD0B47BC9B68AB0"/>to take place, during the period of the ſlaying of the witneſſes?—And if total darkneſs prevails where the witneſſes lie ſlain, is it ſurpriſing that the darkening rays of the ſame chaotic ſcene ſhould, in a higher or leſs degree, penetrate the regions of the truth all around?—Nay, my brethren, men, even in our enlightened day, and in ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant countries, are not wanting, who, with equal power, and equal opportunity, would not be far behind the example of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent executioners of this dark decree. And, under this idea, may we not call upon our miniſters and churches, in every place, to arouſe to action, to fan the flame of ſpiritual life and zeal, that the light of the truth may not be wholly put out?—In a word, that the bodies, the external ſigns and figures of theſe ſlaughtered witneſſes, may not be put in their graves—agreeably to the declaration to this point. <hi>And they of the people, and kindred, and tongues, and nations, ſhall ſee their dead bodies three days and an half, and ſhall not ſuffer their dead bodies to be put in graves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And what encouragement have we to this, whilſt we contemplate the animating pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of verſe 11. <hi>And after three days and an half, the ſpirit of life from God entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

                  </p>

For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich thro' the abundance of her delicacies.

                  <p>The prophecies of Daniel, St. Paul, and St. John, though <hi>ſingly</hi> of great weight, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive additional force if brought near and illuſtrated by each other. Having already examined them ſeparately, and apart, let us now conſider them together, and collect the evidence that ariſes when they are taken in one view, and form an entire and perfect whole.</p>
                  <p>From the moſt curſory view of the three predictions it is evident, that the ſame ſcheme
<pb n="362" facs="unknown:026594_0360_0FD0B46465A1C618"/>and conſtitution of things, the ſame events, perſons and times, the origin, continuance and deſtruction of the ſame tyrannical pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, (which power, by Daniel, is noted by the appellation of the <hi>little horn,</hi> by St. Paul is denominated <hi>the man of ſin,</hi> and by St. John is branded with the titles of the <hi>beaſt,</hi> and the <hi>falſe prophet:</hi>) are <hi>diſtinctly</hi> foretold in all.</p>
                  <p>If Daniel deſcribes the kingdom in which the little horn was to ariſe, by ſuch emblems as can belong to none but the Roman, the ſame emblems, to pre-figure the kingdom of the beaſt and the falſe prophet, are alſo em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by St. John, from whom we farther learn, that his appropriated place of reſidence is the city of Rome.</p>
                  <p>If Daniel reſtrains the ſovereignty of this Roman power to the European or weſtern part of the empire, after it was divided into ten ſhares, the ſame reſtriction is intimated in one of the epiſtles of St. Paul, and is more explicitly declared by the beloved diſciple in the Apocalypſe. If Daniel repreſents the nature of this uſurped dominion as different from any other, St. Paul and St. John in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct us, that this diverſity conſiſts in its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpiritual, not a civil dominion, which is
<pb n="363" facs="unknown:026594_0361_0FD07FE183CF76C0"/>therefore to be ſought for, <hi>not</hi> in the Heath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, but in <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Rome. If the inſtances in which this ſpiritual dominion is exerted, according to Daniel, be chiefly theſe—aſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſupreme and uncontroulable authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty over the inhabitants of the earth—affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divine titles and honors—enjoining the worſhip of daemons and departed ſaints— prohibiting marriage—working falſe mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles— and perſecuting and killing thoſe who oppoſe its claims; the ſame particulars are related, and with new additions and expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations in the writings of St. Paul and St. John. If the <hi>duration</hi> of this eccleſiaſtical polity be limited by Daniel to <hi>a time,</hi> and <hi>times,</hi> and <hi>the dividing of time,</hi> the ſame dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is expreſſed, and, in a variety of phraſes, by St. John, by whom the reign of the beaſt is fixed to a <hi>time,</hi> and <hi>times,</hi> and <hi>half a time,</hi> or to three years and an half, or forty-two months, or twelve hundred and ſixty days.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, if the demolition of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary polity be denounced by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of the Old Teſtament, the ſame inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting event is promiſed by the two apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of the New. Such a number of coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies, all ſo ſtrange and unuſual in their kinds, to be found in the compoſitions of
<pb n="364" facs="unknown:026594_0362_0FD0B466C65379F0"/>three perſons, living in different, and one in a very remote period, cannot fairly be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to any other cauſe than to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe of the <hi>ſelf-ſame ſpirit,</hi> who <hi>taught them all things,</hi> which it was neceſſary ſhould be communicated for the admonition of the church of Chriſt <hi>upon whom the ends of the world</hi> ſhould <hi>come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now of the characters recorded in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as the undoubted marks of Antichriſt, many, at leaſt, have been ſhewn to belong, excluſively, to the <hi>tyranny</hi> now exiſting in Papal Rome. For, <hi>firſt</hi> of all, this power is certainly a Roman one: <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is confined to the limits of the Latin, or weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern empire: <hi>Thirdly,</hi> it aroſe among the ten kingdoms into which that empire was parted by the northern barbarians: <hi>Fourthly,</hi> its throne or ſeat is in the city of Rome: <hi>Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> it is a Chriſtian power; and, <hi>ſixthly,</hi> it is diſcriminated from all others, by being of the ſpiritual or eccleſiaſtic kind. Theſe are cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances ſo plainly realized in that part of Chriſtendom which is ſubject to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Pontiff, that it is not poſſible, by any art or ſubtilty of our adverſaries, they can be evaded or denied."<note n="*" place="bottom">See the eleventh of Biſhop Hurd's Sermons on the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, where the prophetic characters of Antichriſt, above deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are ſhewn, and in a very ſatisfactory way, to be, fairly, appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to the church of Rome.</note>

                  <p>"Sometime between A. D. 500, and the end of the reign of the Goths, which was A.

And it is remarkable that from that very year, when the Jeſuits had excited the reſentments of the kings of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, which finally brought on the diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that order, the power of the church of Rome has been very apparently declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſeveral plain ſteps have been taken by the providence of God toward her ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deſtruction.

If, on the ground of the calculation juſt now mentioned, we proceed, the concluſion obviouſly is, that the deſtruction of Babylon is <hi>very near at hand.</hi> If to 1760, the date of the commencement of her fall, be added fifty years, the term in which ſhe is ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be falling, the ſum will be the period of her expected overthrow. And from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, now before us, we have good ground to conclude, that, if the decree of Heaven goes on for ſixteen years to come, until 1810, as it has for four years paſt, the denunciation for the deſtruction of Babylon will be fully accompliſhed.</p>
                  <p>As to times and ſeaſons, it is not for us exactly to know; and whatever miſtakes we make in our calculation of numbers, it does not however, at all alter the decree, or poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone the effect.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Permit me to point out her guilt as hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at in the chapter from which my text is taken.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Babylon is charged with the extent of her idolatry.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The kings of the earth have committed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with her;</hi> that is, have been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced by her idolatrous communion—unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with her in a general apoſtacy from God.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>My brethren, doth not this ſolemn decree, for the ſeparation of God's people from the ſins and abominations of Babylon, preach to us in theſe United States, even to us, who inhabit this aſylum of the diſtreſſed, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of the habits, cuſtoms, influence and inchanting prerogatives of thoſe who are ſleeing before the vengeance of an incenſed God? <hi>Be not partakers of her ſins, that ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not of her plagues.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This caution is ſupported by the annun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation
<pb n="373" facs="unknown:026594_0371_0FD0B3FC25547CF0"/>of the angel of God. <hi>And there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed another angel, ſaying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, becauſe ſhe made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication. And the third angel followed them, ſaying with a loud voice, If any man worſhip the beaſt and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the ſame ſhall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the cup of his indignation: and he ſhall be tormented with fire and brimſtone in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the holy angels, and in the preſence of the Lamb.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The guilt of Babylon is ſpoken of as ſending forth a cry: <hi>For her ſins have reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.</hi> Either a cry of the perſecuted and ſuffering church, or a cry for vengeance. <hi>And when he had opened the fifth ſeal, I ſaw under the altar the ſouls of them that were ſlain for the word of God, and for the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny which they held. And they cried with a loud voice, ſaying, How long, holy and true, doſt thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth? And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was ſaid unto them, that they ſhould reſt yet for a little
<pb n="374" facs="unknown:026594_0372_0FD0B46CA8020CD8"/>ſeaſon, until their fellow-ſervants alſo, and their brethren, that ſhould be killed as they were, ſhould be fulfilled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. A <hi>remembrance</hi> of the perſecuting ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of this anti-chriſtian power is ſpoken of as warranting a decree for vengeance from the Court of Heaven. <hi>Reward her even as ſhe rewarded you, and double unto her double, according to her work; in the cup which ſhe hath filled, fill to her double.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is probable this injunction or command is given to the miniſters—to the miniſtering angels of God's judgments, in behalf of his church, and though it doth not call for the peaceful followers of the Lamb to wage a carnal warfare with this intolerant power, yet it doubtleſs authoriſes our prayers that her deſtruction may be ſpeedy and inevit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The laſt <hi>inherent</hi> cauſe of this awful calamity I ſhall mention, is found in the pride and haughtineſs, luxury and voluptuouſneſs of this ſelf exalted anti-chriſtian power.— <hi>How much ſhe hath glorified herſelf and liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed deliciouſly, ſo much torment and ſorrow give her. For ſhe ſaith in her heart—I ſit a queen, and am no widow, and ſhall ſee no ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. Therefore ſhall her plagues come in one
<pb n="375" facs="unknown:026594_0373_0FD0B3FDEC86A2C8"/>day, death, and mourning, and famine; and ſhe ſhall be utterly burned with fire: for ſtrong is the Lord God who judgeth her.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am led to conclude this branch of my diſcourſe, by adding, that the <hi>final</hi> cauſe of the deſtruction of Babylon is the <hi>ſentence</hi> of God againſt her. This ſentence is pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by an angel from the court, from the <hi>tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal</hi> of heaven. <hi>And he cried mightily with a ſtrong voice, ſaying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen. And a mighty angel took up a ſtone like a great milſtone, and caſt it into the ſea, ſaying. Thus with violence ſhall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and ſhall be found no more at all.</hi> If you aſk the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this judicial ſentence from the tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of heaven, it is ſaid—<hi>For by thy ſorceries were all nations deceived. And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of ſaints, and of all that were ſlain upon the earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having pointed out who it is over whoſe deſtruction holy angels and men are called upon to rejoice, and conſidered the <hi>cauſe</hi> of this awful cataſtrophe, my ſubject leads,</p>
                  <p n="3">III. To conſider the <hi>means</hi> by which this event ſhall be brought about.</p>
                  <p>And what <hi>means,</hi> my audience, ſhould you ſuppoſe might be adequate to ſuch a taſk?
<pb n="376" facs="unknown:026594_0374_0FD0B46E279865F8"/>to the taſk of overturning a power which hath ſubſiſted more than twelve hundred years, ſupported by the kings of the earth, who drink of her cup, and delight in her ſorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries —who have long ſince lent their aid for her ſupport againſt the voice of reaſon—the demands of Heaven, and the cries of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing thouſands?—What power is equal to the taſk of accompliſhing even the <hi>decree of Heaven</hi> againſt ſuch might, ſuch united force as Babylon is able to bring into the field? more eſpecially, when you conſider that for the terror of her enemies, and for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of her friends, this intolerant power pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes to have in poſſeſſion the keys of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and of hell?</p>
                  <p>Retreat you will be ready to ſay from ſuch a taſk! Let no one be ſo preſumptuous as to provoke her to anger, as to ſtir up her fury! —Many have been devoured by this levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, by this multi-formed, inſatiable mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; and God forbid that any more ſhould be ſwallowed up, whilſt they are able to make but a feeble, though honeſt attempt!</p>
                  <p>Our fears, my friends, are relieved whilſt I read to you, from the inſpiration of God, that the angel that pronounces the decree of deſtruction is commiſſioned from the Court
<pb n="377" facs="unknown:026594_0375_0FD0B3FF25C5E430"/>of Heaven; has <hi>great power, and that the earth is lightened with his glory.</hi> And to ſupport the executioner of the ſentence it is added, <hi>for ſtrong is the Lord God who judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As then the decree hath its origin in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the promulgation of it is by a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger from Heaven, we are authoriſed to look to Heaven for MEANS to accompliſh what its decree hath ordained.</p>
                  <p>Did it pleaſe the Lord of Hoſts, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient time, to promiſe deliverance to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews in Egyptian bondage; and did he not graciouſly provide the means of deliverance? —Was it in after times threatened againſt this rebellious people that, for their hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy and ſins, they ſhould go into captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and did not a righteous God provide the means to execute the ſentence?—Hear the appointment of heaven to this taſk. <hi>O Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian! the rod of mine anger, and the ſtaff in their hand is mine indignation! I will ſend him againſt an hypocritical nation, and againſt the people of my wrath will I give him a charge to take the ſpoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire in the ſtreets. Howbeit he meaneth not ſo, neither doth his
<pb n="378" facs="unknown:026594_0376_0FD0B46FA6A53428"/>heart think ſo; but it is in his heart to deſtroy, and out off nations not a few.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wherefore it ſhall come to paſs, that, when the Lord hath performed his whole work upon Mount Zion, and on Jeruſalem, I will puniſh the fruit of the ſtout heart of the king of Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, and the glory of his high looks; for he ſaith, by the ſtrength of my hand I have done it, and by my wiſdom; for I am prudent: and I have removed the bounds of the people, and have robbed their treaſures, and I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I cite this paſſage at length, not only that the ſentiments under conſideration may be ſupported, as to <hi>means</hi> of execution, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the decree of Heaven; but to teach that means may be appointed, and may e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven execute the will of Heaven, and yet be themſelves wholly ignorant of the God they are ſerving—be vaſtly ſinful in what they do, and be, finally, ſorely puniſhed for the ungodly deed.</p>
                  <p>Again, did it pleaſe God to promiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance to the captive Jews from Babylon; and did he not gird his man for the purpoſe? <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord to his anointed, to Cyrus, whoſe right hand I have holden, to ſubdue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions before him; and I will looſe the loins of
<pb n="379" facs="unknown:026594_0377_0FD0B400D65AF238"/>kings, to open before him the two-leaved gates, and the gates ſhall not be ſhut: I will go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, and make the crooked places ſtraight: I will break in pieces the gates of braſs, and out in ſunder the bars of iron. For Jacob my ſervant's ſake, and Iſrael mine elect, I have even called thee by thy name: I have ſurnam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee though thou haſt not known me. I am the Lord, and there is none elſe, there is no God beſides me: I girded thee, though thou haſt not known me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe examples of means provided for the accompliſhment of mercies promiſed or for the execution of judgments denounced, in the wiſdom of God, lay good foundation for as to proceed, and afford unerring di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to us in our enquries after the means or methods which God will provide and uſe, for the execution of the awful ſentence of which our ſubject treats.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Babylon is fallen, is fallen!</hi> But by what means is ſhe to be brought down?</p>
                  <p>The ſtate of this anti-chriſtian church is ſpoken of under ſeveral figures or emblems, all of which are to have their end in ſome method ſuited to the deſtruction of the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal figure.</p>
                  <p>If we aſk after the deſtruction of this
<pb n="380" facs="unknown:026594_0378_0FD0B406A5426808"/>church under the figure of Babylon, we ſhall find the means pre-figured under the pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the ſixth vial—the vial which all preſent expoſitors allow to be now running.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the ſixth angel poured out his vial up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the great river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the eaſt might be prepared.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I need not detain you here to ſay that the river Euphrates ſignifies the wealth, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, the ſtrength and ſupport of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever kind, by which Papal Babylon hath, in time paſt, been upheld:—And if you wiſh to know whether this river hath been, or is now drying up, you may be informed by aſking thoſe who can tell to what end the revenues of the church of Rome have late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come. You may aſk where are her pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges and prerogatives, her churches, her church-lands, her wonted revenues from princes and from ſubjects, eſpecially, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to thoſe parts of the empire on which the contents of this vial have already been poured?—You may aſk, where is that faith, that <hi>implicit</hi> faith which was once put in her?—that domination which ſhe maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over the conſciences of men?—Where are her idols—her maſſes—her ſuperſtitions
<pb n="381" facs="unknown:026594_0379_0FD0B435E7826528"/>—her miniſters?—As to her revenues, it will be anſwered, they have ceaſed;—as to faith, confidence and truſt in this once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted fountain of truth and infallibility, it will be ſaid, it is departed; her ſubjects have thrown off the maſk, and refuſe to be hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winked any longer. As to her idols, ſo far as there was any value in them, they are now paſſing in coin; and as to her miniſters, they are executed and diſperſed. Even the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of Sorbonne<note n="*" place="bottom">A celebrated inſtitution, or college, for the reſidence of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, profeſſors, and ſtudents in divinity, at Paris, who ſuffered in the general calamity.</note> is obliged to yield up her magi, and give them, to her foes, a prey.</p>
                  <p>If you aſk why the drying up of the river Euphrates is ſpoken of, <hi>that the way of the kings of the eaſt may be prepared?</hi> I anſwer, in a word, that as ancient Euphrates was dried up, that the way of her enemies, who came from the eaſt, might be prepared, in their approach to her deſtruction; ſo this myſtical river is dried up, that the city itſelf may become an eaſy prey.</p>
                  <p>On this paſſage hear the language of a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious divine.<note n="†" place="bottom">Burkit in loco.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>"In the drying up of the river Euphrates,
<pb n="382" facs="unknown:026594_0380_0FD0B47145981160"/>manifeſt alluſion is had to the manner of old Babylon's deſtruction. The river Euphrates <hi>ran through old Babylon,</hi> and was a greater defence to it than its celebrated walls, which, for thickneſs and height, were the wonder of the world. Cyrus, "the leader of the Kings of the Eaſt," when he took Babylon, cut many ditches, and let the river Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes run out, and ſo he and his ſoldiers enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the city, and took it. As the drying up of Euphrates, <hi>then,</hi> was an immediate fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of the deſtruction of Babylon; in like manner, the drying up of Euphrates, ſignify it what it will, ſhall be the immediate fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of the deſtruction of anti-chriſtian Babylon, whenever it ſhall be. The Romiſh Euphrates being dried up, the Romiſh Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon will haſten, amain, towards its final ruin."</p>
                  <p>Whether the Euphrates of the Romiſh Babylon is not already ſo far dried up, as that the Kings of the Eaſt have made a breach upon her, let facts and daily intelligence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine.</p>

                  <p>And what period of time, my brethren, hath ever looked ſo likely to be introducto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the regnum montis, to the kingdom of the mountain, as the preſent?

                  <p>And if it may not be preſuming too far, I would venture to aſſert, that appearances are not only now favoring the introduction of the REGNUM MONTIS, but that it has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready begun, and is conſiderably advanced in its progreſs. But,</p>

On the part of all who have received, and now maintain the teſtimony of God, as recorded in his holy word, there is cauſe of joy, that the fulfilment of the many prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies reſpecting <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> the <hi>man of ſin,</hi> &amp;c. are fulfilled, and thereby an accumulation of evidence is obtained of the authenticity of the ſcriptures, as being in deed and in truth the LIVELY ORACLES OF GOD.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. There is cauſe of joy, in this ſolemn and affecting event, becauſe it is one of the <hi>laſt</hi> things to take place, before it ſhall be proclaimed—<hi>The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Chriſt, and he ſhall reign for ever and ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And I heard a loud voice ſaying in heaven, Now is come ſalvation, and ſtrength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Chriſt; for the accuſer of our brethren is caſt out, which accuſed them before God day and night.</hi>

                  <p>This ſubject being a leading object, in this work, you will permit me to preſent, in a very brief manner, the ſeveral denunciations of wrath againſt myſtical Babylon, and ſhew the acclamations of joy that immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, on account of the important and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting events which follow.</p>
                  <p>Is the anti-chriſtian power of Rome ſet
<pb n="398" facs="unknown:026594_0396_0FD0B4A96F02C658"/>forth by the <hi>iron and clay</hi> of the great image? and is it to be daſhed in pieces by the ſtone cut out without hands? immediately it is predicted, that the ſtone that ſmote the image became a <hi>great mountain and filled the whole earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is this intolerant power repreſented by the <hi>horn which came up</hi> among the ten horns;—by the horn which <hi>had eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth ſpeaking great things. I beheld, then,</hi> ſaith the prophet, <hi>becauſe of the great words which the horn ſpake: I beheld even till the beaſt was ſlain, and his body de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and given to the burning flame. I ſaw in the night viſions, and behold, one like the Son of Man came in the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of Days, and they brought him near before him. And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, and nations, and languages ſhould ſerve him. His dominion is an everlaſting dominion, which ſhall not paſs away, and his kingdom that which ſhall not be deſtroyed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is this power ſpoken of as to riſe, after the <hi>falling away,</hi> in the character of the MAN OF SIN—<hi>the ſon of perdition, who oppoſeth and exalteth himſelf above all that is called God, or worſhipped; ſo that he as God, ſitteth in the

                  <p>And after the deſtruction of Babylon, as recorded in this ninteenth chapter, <hi>I heard,</hi> ſaith the apoſtle, <hi>a great voice of much peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in heaven, ſaying, Alleluia: Salvation, and glory, and honor, and power, unto the Lord our God: for true and righteous are his judgments; for he hath judged the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and hath avenged the blood of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants at her hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the concluſion of the whole ſcene of diſtreſs, of which the ninteenth chapter of this book is a lively picture, the twentieth chapter begins with the introduction of the Millennial-day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And I ſaw an angel come down from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, having the key of the bottomleſs pit, and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on the dragon, that old ſerpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a</hi> THOU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SAND YEARS.</p>
                  <p>After ſuch deſcriptions of ſucceſs, and joy to follow, in favor of the church of Chriſt, after the downfall of Babylon, you will not
<pb n="400" facs="unknown:026594_0398_0FD0B4ABF1A215D0"/>wonder that the church ſhould be called, nor that ſhe ſhould be diſpoſed to rejoice at the overthrow.</p>
                  <p>I have now gone through with the doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal part of my diſcourſe: I have conſidered <hi>who it is,</hi> over whoſe deſtruction holy beings are called upon to rejoice—the <hi>cauſe</hi> of this diſaſter—the <hi>means</hi> employed to bring it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and the foundation it lays for univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal joy.</p>

That by the wilderneſs, we are to underſtand a ſtate of ſpiritual dearth and barrenneſs, or thoſe leaves, ſhades, and darkening boughs of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, which have been as the ſhades of a wilderneſs to hinder the ſpiritual growth; or, laſtly, a wilderneſs in the literal and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon acceptation of the word.

<pb n="410" facs="unknown:026594_0408_0FD0B4B264B68F40"/>In this ſenſe, denoting the power of God in conquering the enemies of his people, and in ſecuring them under the banner of his own protection—the phraſe is uſed in Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus xix. 4. <hi>Ye have ſeen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on</hi> EAGLE'S WINGS, <hi>and brought you unto myſelf.</hi> And after a long courſe of protection afforded to the people of God, through the wilderneſs of Sinai, and their ſettlement in the promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed land, it is again ſaid, Deut. xxxii. 9—12. <hi>For the Lord's portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance. He found him in a deſert land, and in the waſte howling wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: he led him about, he inſtructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye. As an eagle ſtirreth up her neſt, fluttereth over her young, ſpreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them on her wings; ſo the Lord alone did lead him, and there was no ſtrange god with him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Under the ſame idea of the divine agency and protection afforded, ſaith the Pſalmiſt— <hi>Becauſe thou haſt been my help, therefore, in the ſhadow of thy wings, will I rejoice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This foundation being laid as a key to the chapter, may we not proceed, and ſay, that the woman denotes the ſtate of the church
<pb n="411" facs="unknown:026594_0409_0FD0B491668EBE28"/>in its firſt inſtitution? <hi>And there appeared a great wonder in heaven, a woman cloathed with the ſun;</hi> it may be with the veſtments of the ſun of righteouſneſs; <hi>and the moon under her feet;</hi> the earth and other ſublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary things in their proper place; <hi>and upon her head a crown of twelve ſtars;</hi> guided and governed by the unadulterated doctrines of the twelve apoſtles. In this character, the church of Chriſt at firſt ſtood forth; but ſo ſoon was the truth beclouded—her privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges reſtrained, and her members perſecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that ſhe, ſtruggling for civil and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous liberty, is denominated as <hi>being with child,</hi> as <hi>travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.</hi> The character of a woman the church is ſuppoſed to take, as denoting her delicacy—her fruitfulneſs, and her need of protection.</p>
                  <p>But under the laſhes of paganiſm and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh tyranny, ſhe was obliged to groan out the ten perſecutions, until, in the perſon of Conſtantine the Great, the firſt Chriſtian emperor, ſhe brought forth her firſt-born, and lived, for a while, under the happy do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of civil and religious liberty.</p>
                  <p>And who would have thought that, in proceſs of time, proſperity would have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced

                  <p>And ſhall it, may it now be ſaid, that the ſpirit of proteſtantiſm—the hero of deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from the thraldom of Popery, ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo degenerated as, in the ſmalleſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, to act over the part of its Papal and Pagan predeceſſors?

                  <p>The ſufferings of the Proteſtants, under

                  <p>But, behold! how ſoon does the perſecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed woman receive an anſwer to her ſolemn appeals, and reiterated cries? See, on the wings of a bounteous providence, how ſhe is wafted acroſs the Atlantic, and ſettled in theſe peaceful American abodes!—Happy, that as the time of general redemption comes, her enemies are held in partial reſtraint.— Here ſhe is purſued and perſecuted only in outward and civil things; though what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns might have been formed againſt her religious freedom we cannot ſay.</p>
                  <p>In a word, behold the hero of civil and religious liberty born in theſe weſtern climes! And ſee him already on his way back <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And is it too much to ſuppoſe, that, in his progreſs back, he will demoliſh all that is contrary to the ſpirit of the truth—to the intent and deſign of that power, under whoſe auſpices he now proceeds, conquering and

And thus, my audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence did the Pagan Dragon, in the perſon and perſecutions of Julian the Apoſtate; and thus did the Papal Dragon, in all the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, thunders, and councils, by which he hath vexed and deſtroyed the Proteſtants; and thus has the Proteſtant Dragon done, not only in heavy perſecutions for conſcience ſake, but, eſpecially, in the ſlood of troops, armies and fleets—Britons and Iriſh, Brunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wickers and Waldeckers, Heſſians and Anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pachers, which this red dragon vomited forth for the deſtruction of the woman in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican wilderneſs, during the late unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked and cruel war; and thus is this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Dragon, even now, but too ready to expreſs of his perſecuting temper, in open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

But we believe in God, our hope and confidence is in him, and to his protecting power and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence do we, therefore, humbly appeal.</p>
