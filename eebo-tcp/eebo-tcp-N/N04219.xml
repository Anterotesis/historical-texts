            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>But then putting on that Charity which <hi>is not eaſily provoked,</hi> and <hi>hopeth all Things,</hi> I endeavoured to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the three Sermons as a <hi>Retractation</hi> of the <hi>Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> Sermon; That altho' he did not expreſly retract it, yet I would charitably caſt it in this Light, for the ſake of <hi>Catholick Unity,</hi> and becauſe it ſeems hard for an <hi>High Prieſt</hi> to confeſs his <hi>Errors</hi> even once a Year, tho' he may love to be <hi>Father Confeſſor</hi> himſelf, and bring others to the Stool.</p>

But upon Enquiry, it is to be ſuſpected that Mr. <hi>Tennent</hi> never deſign'd that theſe <hi>three Sermons</hi> ſhould ſuperceed the other; but that they ſhould conſiſt and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel together like good Companions. For it is plain that after Mr. <hi>T</hi>—had preached theſe Sermons at <hi>N. York,</hi> in <hi>April</hi> 1742, his Sermon at <hi>Nottingham</hi> receives a new Edition at <hi>Boſton,</hi> from the <hi>ſecond Edition</hi> printed at <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia;</hi> by which it appears that Mr. <hi>T.</hi> or his Friends, inſtead of ſuppreſſing it, have been careful to propagate it, as his <hi>Maſter-Piece;</hi> and indeed it is a Maſter-Piece of it's kind: And not only ſo, but I'm credibly inform'd, that he has lately juſtified it, as containing the genuine Sentiments of his Soul; and I'm apt to think he has ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Truth. And no wonder Mr. <hi>T.</hi> won't abate one Jot or Tittle of it, ſince Mr. <hi>W—d</hi> has judg'd it <hi>an unanſwerable Piece:</hi> for <hi>his Counſel</hi> it ſeems with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in theſe Days is, <hi>as if a Man had enquired at the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of GOD.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">The <hi>Queriſts, Part</hi> III, <hi>Page</hi> 5, take Notice, that it hath been obſerved that when it is Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi>'s turn to ſpeak, then Mr. <hi>G. Tennent</hi> is proclaimed the <hi>moſt able, moſt eminent Servant of Chriſt, and all his Aſſociates or Party, ſpiritual Men, and faithful Miniſters of Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c. And in the <hi>Examiner, Pag.</hi> 149, it is affirmed, that when Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> preached a Sermon at <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia,</hi> he told a numerous Audience, that there were but few faithful Miniſters of Chriſt in theſe Parts; and if he muſt be plain and name them, it was the <hi>Tennents</hi> and their Adherents: The like he did at <hi>Fog's Mannor.</hi>
                  <p>On the other Hand, If their Turn comes to ſpeak or write, then Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> is proclaimed the <hi>moſt able, and moſt eminent Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of Chriſt.</hi>—When there is ſuch an Hue and Cry after Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, we would be glad to know, whether it would be ſafe for the other ſide to trumpet one anothers Praiſes ſo loudly and highly as this ſide doth, without being in Danger of being taken up for Phariſees, and having the Crows Eggs caſt in their Teeth? becauſe Chriſt ſaith to thoſe Phariſees that were offended at him for heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Man on the Sabbath, John 5, 44. <hi>How can ye believe, that receive Honour one of another?</hi>

It is plain alſo, That Mr. <hi>T—t</hi>'s zealous Advocates here and elſewhere, have by way of <hi>Charity,</hi> diſpers'd about the Country great Numbers of the laſt Edition, tending to corrupt the Minds of People from the <hi>Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity which is in Chriſt,</hi> and to promote that <hi>Confuſion</hi> and <hi>ſeparating Spirit</hi> which he himſelf has been inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental of raiſing in many of our Places; <hi>Which the Lord rebuke in his Time.</hi> For many are fully perſwaded that Mr. <hi>T—t</hi>'s Sermon and Practice upon it, have ſown the Seeds of all that <hi>Diſcord, Intruſion, Confuſion, Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, Hatred, Variance, Emulations, Wrath, Strife, Seditions, Hereſies,</hi> &amp;c. that have been ſpringing up in ſo many of the Towns and Churches <hi>thro' the Province for two Years paſt.</hi> Who hath been ſo inſtrumental to hatch the <hi>Cockatrice</hi> as himſelf, tho' at the ſame Time he could gravely adviſe others to <hi>cruſh it in the Egg</hi>

            <p>Whoever will take the Pains to conſider the main Scope of Mr. <hi>Tennent</hi>'s Sermon at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> will find the Principles of it to be ſubverſive of Goſpel Order, the publick Miniſtry and publick Means of Education; and what have we more?

Furthermore, I can't find any Room for rational Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Charity to think that Mr. <hi>T</hi>—ever intended that his laſt Diſcourſes ſhould be interpreted as a Retracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Sermon at <hi>Nottingham;</hi> and therefore as long as he holds two Sett of Principles as oppoſite to one another, as the heatheniſh Principles of a good and an evil god, and until he makes a publick and ſolemn Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractation of <hi>that Sermon,</hi> it is but juſt and equal to ſet <hi>Gilbert</hi> againſt <hi>Tennent,</hi> and <hi>judge him out of his own Mouth.</hi>

            <p>Moreover, Having reviewed the <hi>florid Preface</hi> to Mr. <hi>Tennent</hi>'s late Diſcourſes, ſubſcribed by <hi>Six Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Divines,</hi> 
               <q>of whoſe Opinion it's ſaid much Uſe is made in the Country,</q> I ſtumbled at the Threſhold again, when I could not find one Word to help out my Charity towards reconciling Mr. <hi>T—t</hi> with himſelf: But they ſet it forth as an Epiſtle of Commendation of this their <hi>dear Brother</hi> and his Works without any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</p>
            <p>They call his Performance, <q>
                  <hi>A Labour of Love and Effort of holy Zeal of One that has learn'd to contend earneſtly for the Faith once delivered to the Saints; and with the Light of a wiſe Maſter-Builder, on the Foundation which Chriſt and his Apoſtles have laid.</hi>
               </q> The Metaphor would run as ſmoothly in the Words of the great <hi>Apoſtle, A Workman that needeth not to be aſhamed, rightly</hi> dividing <hi>the Word of Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They ſay further, <q>When this our <hi>dear Brother, whoſe Praiſe is in the Churches</hi> thro' the Provinces, viſited us at <hi>Boſton,</hi> two Years ago, and in the Spirit of the Rev. Mr. <hi>Whitefield,</hi> entred into his Labours here; it pleaſed God in a wonderful Manner to crown his abundant Services with Succeſs, in the Conviction, and (we truſt) Converſion of many Souls: As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Name of Mr. <hi>Tennent</hi> is greatly endear'd to us, ſo we beſeech our aſcended SAVIOUR, the Head
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005200_0007_1016E25284268000"/>of the Church long to continue him for a burning Light, and extenſive Bleſſing to our Provinces; and in particular to uſe this faithful, judicious, and ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Endeavour of his Servant, for a Guard and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence about his own ſacred Truths, and his glorious Work in the midſt of us, which too many are ready to ſpeak evil of and oppoſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>One muſt be cloathed with Charity down to the Foot to think that theſe <hi>Reverend Gentlemen</hi> had not ſeen Mr. <hi>Tennent's</hi> Sermon at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> &amp;c. which ſtands in direct Oppoſition to ſome Parts of his Doctrine and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct expreſt in theſe Sermons and elſewhere, as I ſhall demonſtrate in parallel Lines.</p>
            <p>If therefore they had well confidered and compared the one with the other, how is it reconcileable with the <hi>Simplicity that is in CHRIST,</hi> to repreſent Mr. <hi>T</hi>— as ſuch a <hi>burning Light,</hi> when his Spots are ſo conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous to the moſt curſory Reader?— One might expect that if Mr. <hi>Tennent</hi> had not the Ingenuity to ſay, <hi>I Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi> that at leaſt theſe <hi>Reverend Gentlemen</hi> would have attempted a Reconciliation for him, if they think as <hi>Proteſtants</hi> generally do that <hi>Infallibility may miſtake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay ought they not to have ſaid publickly (as it is affirmed One of them ſaid in private Converſation) that Mr. <hi>T. was now come Right:</hi> I ſuppoſe he meant <hi>Right about;</hi> which implies, that <hi>he had been Wrong.</hi> But it ſeems no Man dar'd or car'd to ſay unto him, <hi>Why doſt thou ſuch Things?</hi> Such is the Danger of <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Men's Perſons in Admiration, becauſe of Advantage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It ſeems, Such a prime Inſtrument of <hi>the Work</hi> that has been going on in the <hi>American</hi> Provinces for the two laſt Years, muſt be judged infallible and ſupported with the higheſt <hi>Encomiums</hi> of Six moſt Reverend Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,<note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>He came <hi>in the Spirit of Mr. Whitefield,</hi> when he treated the Body of the Miniſtry in this Province with ſo much Neglect and Contempt as he did<note n="†" place="bottom">See Mr. <hi>Whitefield's</hi> Journal.</note>, not only in not ſuffering himſelf to hear any of them, no not in <hi>Boſton</hi> it ſelf except once or twice; but alſo in cruelly cenſuring them in general and raiſing Jealouſies in the Minds of People of their Faithful Miniſters even to that Degree, as hath ended in a <hi>Spirit</hi> of dreadful <hi>Separation</hi> in many Places.</p>
            <p>But then are theſe Rev <hi>Meſſirs.</hi> of the the ſame Mind, Spirit and Judgment?

                  <hi>Do not they take the Devils Part, who uſe Methods to further ſuch ſad Appearances, and condemn them for Oppoſers of GOD's Work, who labour to undeceive People about theſe Fits, by aſcribing them to inferiour Cauſes?</hi>

            <p>Theſe Reverend Gentlemen conclude their Preface by ſaying, <q>
                  <hi>We beſeech our aſcended Saviour, the Head of the Church in particular to uſe this faithful, judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and ſeaſonable Endeavour of his Servant, for a Guard and Defence about his own ſacred Truths, and his glorious Work in the midſt of us, which too many are ready to ſpeak evil of and oppoſe.</hi>

               <hi>Deluſion.</hi> There are many wild Diſorders and Confuſions in ſome of our Churches at this Day which really reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Diſorders in the Times of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. Neceſſity is therefore laid upon the faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of CHRIST to bear publick and <hi>ſeaſonable</hi> Teſtimony againſt them; and pity it is theſe Rev.

But ſeeing they refuſe to give a differencing Account of <hi>the Work,</hi> it is well that one of the Country Miniſters hath ſince faithfully done it to their Hand, in one of their Pulpits.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Aſhley</hi> in his Sermon on CHARITY, preached in the Church in <hi>Brattle-Street.</hi>

               <q>That the Reader may be able to form a right Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the contending Parties, let him reſolve this plain Query, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether the Oppoſers of Enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtick Pranks, ſet up under the Name of Reformations or Religion; or the warm Admirers of and Contenders for ſuch, deſerve the Name of <hi>Oppoſers of God</hi>'s <hi>Work?</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the whole, I could find no other Key but that in the Sermon upon <hi>the little Foxes</hi> in the End of Mr. <hi>Tennent</hi>'s late Treatiſe, to let him out of the Labyrinth into which he had plunged himſelf. Where it is ſaid Pag. 8, 9. <hi>Foxes have Holes. Foxes have moſt commonly many Ways and Paſſages to come out at, becauſe if one ſhould be ſtopt or cloſed up, they may have another to creep out at.—Foxes are crafty, and know how to diſſemble.— Foxes that they may not be ſo eaſily enſnared, ſeldom run right forward, but run to one Side, and to the other Side and croſs ways.</hi>—They have a ſly Way <hi>of creeping into other Holes, and of turning other Animals,</hi> (it may be ſaid) out of their rightful Poſſeſſions, ſo it is with reſpect to— for of this Sort are <hi>theſe which creep into Houſes,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.6. And it may be generally ſaid of them, <hi>that they creep into ſetled Miniſtries and Congregations, and turn out thoſe that are Orthodox amongſt them,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:005200_0012_1016E295A5DEE2A0"/>
It is evident that Mr. <hi>T</hi>— deſign'd by tranſlating this Sermon, that it ſhould be uſed as a Key to open the cunning, crafty Intreagues and Evaſions of the <hi>Moravians</hi> in propagating their <hi>wild</hi> and <hi>frightful Errors.</hi> See <hi>Page</hi> 65, 100.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>T.</hi> muſt excuſe me if I turn the ſame Key upon himſelf, to let him out of many Inconſiſtencies and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions charged upon him; <hi>I expect that he will make uſe of Fox-like Shifts to evade the Diſcovery.</hi>—Witneſs his <hi>ſecond Letter</hi> printed in the <hi>Penſylvania Gazette</hi> of <hi>Sept.</hi> 2.1742.<note n="*" place="bottom">

And in <hi>Page</hi> 52. "He directs in order to hold faſt Chriſt's precious Truth, it is needful to <hi>wave a poſitive Concluſion, reſpecting the good State of Strangers, when we have not ſufficient Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences for it, in reſpect of their Principles, Experiences, and Practice.</hi> Raſh Judging either Way is certainly unreaſonable and prejudicial: When Perſons do ſpeedily, without ſufficient Grounds conclude <hi>Strangers,</hi> who come among them, to be Pious, and perhaps eminently ſo becauſe of their fair Appearances in Behaviour, without examining their Principles.

               </p>
               <p>I am confident the impartial Reader is full convinced by this time that Mr. <hi>Tennent</hi> has drawn his own Picture to the Life, by the Repreſentation he has given of the Principles and Practices of the <hi>Moravians,</hi> and that I have only ſet the Mirror in ſuch a poſition that He and his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents may ſee themſelves and be aſhamed. But if they are blinded with Self-love, Admiration, Conceit, Party-Zeal, and the like, and will not, or cannot ſee their own likeneſs. I believe others have ſo much of a Spirit of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning as to ſee that Mr. <hi>T</hi>—and his Partizans as nearly reſemble the Character here given of the <hi>Moravians as one Crow's Egg does another</hi> (to uſe his own homely Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon.)</p>
               <p>The Reader may take this Examination as an help to diſcover <hi>what is Truth</hi> in the <hi>late Religious Commotion</hi> in this Country, and he will find it to be juſt that which the <hi>Oppoſers</hi> ſo called, are zealous to maintain, <hi>viz.</hi> the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Goſpel, and the ſacred Honours due to the holy Spirit of God. Strip <hi>this Work</hi> of its <hi>Extraordinary's,</hi> and you will diſcern what is <hi>the Work of God,</hi> from that which is added to it <hi>by Art</hi> and <hi>Man's device.</hi> 
                  <q>Pray what is there extraordinary on one ſide more that t'other; but what is juſtly to be exploded, <hi>viz.</hi> extraordinary Errors, Diſorders, Intruſions, raſh Cenſures, Clamours, Excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, vain glorious Boaſtings, Fits, Pretence of Sights and Viſions, Roarings, Tremblings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

I know of no <hi>ſhorter Method</hi> to open the Eyes of <hi>blind party-Zealots,</hi> and convince them of the bad Tendency of extraordinary Self-Conceit, Dominion, raſh Judging, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than to bring them home to their own Doors, and turn theſe edge Tools upon themſelves; prove them now here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and you will find theſe crucified Gentlemen have yet as much Senſation and are as ready to <hi>cry out of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> as any of their abuſed Neighbours.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Moravians</hi> it ſeems treated Mr. <hi>Tennent</hi> in the ſame uncharitable, cenſorious, imperious, diviſive Manner in which he himſelf has treated the <hi>Body of the Clergy of this Generation,</hi> and then the Spirit appears to him in a moſt frightful Shape, and muſt be avoided. <hi>Now it is come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee, thou fainteſt: And it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is generally tho't that Mr. <hi>D—pt's</hi> clamorous Preaching in <hi>Boſton</hi> againſt unconverted Miniſters, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at <hi>C—p</hi>'s Hill, tended more to open the Mouths of ſome <hi>Reverend leading Miniſters</hi> there, to <hi>forbid the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Prophet,</hi> than ſeven Men that can render a Reaſon. Therefore let the Clergy as well as Laity <hi>bear one another's Burdens,</hi> and <hi>remember them that are in Bonds as bound with them, and as being themſelves alſo in the Body.

                  <hi>In fine,</hi> I muſt earneſtly adviſe Mr. <hi>Tennent</hi> to retract his famous Sermon at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> and call in the ſeveral Editions of it, for 'till then it is as impoſſible to reconcile <hi>Gilbert</hi> with <hi>Tennent</hi> as to mingle Light with Darkneſs, <hi>a double minded Man is unſtable in all his Ways:</hi> Nay, I think he ought in Conſcience to make a ſolemn Retracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it and cry <hi>Peccavi,</hi> (and all ſuch Changlings with him.) For it is a meer <hi>Incendiary</hi> wherever it tracks abroad and nothing but the <hi>Fire</hi> can purge and purify it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If any Mans Work abide which he hath built upon the true Foundation which is Chriſt, he ſhall receive a Reward. If any Mans Work ſhall be burnt, he ſhall ſuffer loſs, but he himſelf ſhall be ſaved, yet ſo as by Fire.</hi>
