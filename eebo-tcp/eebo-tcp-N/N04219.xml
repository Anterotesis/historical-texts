            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But upon Enquiry, it is to be ≈øu≈øpected that Mr. <hi>Tennent</hi> never de≈øign'd that the≈øe <hi>three Sermons</hi> ≈øhould ≈øuperceed the other; but that they ≈øhould con≈øi≈øt and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel together like good Companions. For it is plain that after Mr. <hi>T</hi>‚Äîhad preached the≈øe Sermons at <hi>N. York,</hi> in <hi>April</hi> 1742, his Sermon at <hi>Nottingham</hi> receives a new Edition at <hi>Bo≈øton,</hi> from the <hi>≈øecond Edition</hi> printed at <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia;</hi> by which it appears that Mr. <hi>T.</hi> or his Friends, in≈øtead of ≈øuppre≈ø≈øing it, have been careful to propagate it, as his <hi>Ma≈øter-Piece;</hi> and indeed it is a Ma≈øter-Piece of it's kind: And not only ≈øo, but I'm credibly inform'd, that he has lately ju≈øtified it, as containing the genuine Sentiments of his Soul; and I'm apt to think he has ≈øpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Truth. And no wonder Mr. <hi>T.</hi> won't abate one Jot or Tittle of it, ≈øince Mr. <hi>W‚Äîd</hi> has judg'd it <hi>an unan≈øwerable Piece:</hi> for <hi>his Coun≈øel</hi> it ≈øeems with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the≈øe Days is, <hi>as if a Man had enquired at the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of GOD.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">The <hi>Queri≈øts, Part</hi> III, <hi>Page</hi> 5, take Notice, that it hath been ob≈øerved that when it is Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi>'s turn to ≈øpeak, then Mr. <hi>G.

Furthermore, I can't find any Room for rational Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian Charity to think that Mr. <hi>T</hi>‚Äîever intended that his la≈øt Di≈øcour≈øes ≈øhould be interpreted as a Retracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Sermon at <hi>Nottingham;</hi> and therefore as long as he holds two Sett of Principles as oppo≈øite to one another, as the heatheni≈øh Principles of a good and an evil god, and until he makes a publick and ≈øolemn Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractation of <hi>that Sermon,</hi> it is but ju≈øt and equal to ≈øet <hi>Gilbert</hi> again≈øt <hi>Tennent,</hi> and <hi>judge him out of his own Mouth.</hi>

            <p>Moreover, Having reviewed the <hi>florid Preface</hi> to Mr. <hi>Tennent</hi>'s late Di≈øcour≈øes, ≈øub≈øcribed by <hi>Six Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Divines,</hi> 
               <q>of who≈øe Opinion it's ≈øaid much U≈øe is made in the Country,</q> I ≈øtumbled at the Thre≈øhold again, when I could not find one Word to help out my Charity towards reconciling Mr. <hi>T‚Äît</hi> with him≈øelf: But they ≈øet it forth as an Epi≈øtle of Commendation of this their <hi>dear Brother</hi> and his Works without any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</p>
            <p>They call his Performance, <q>
                  <hi>A Labour of Love and Effort of holy Zeal of One that has learn'd to contend earne≈øtly for the Faith once delivered to the Saints; and with the Light of a wi≈øe Ma≈øter-Builder, on the Foundation which Chri≈øt and his Apo≈øtles have laid.</hi>
               </q> The Metaphor would run as ≈ømoothly in the Words of the great <hi>Apo≈øtle, A Workman that needeth not to be a≈øhamed, rightly</hi> dividing <hi>the Word of Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They ≈øay further, <q>When this our <hi>dear Brother, who≈øe Prai≈øe is in the Churches</hi> thro' the Provinces, vi≈øited us at <hi>Bo≈øton,</hi> two Years ago, and in the Spirit of the Rev. Mr. <hi>Whitefield,</hi> entred into his Labours here; it plea≈øed God in a wonderful Manner to crown his abundant Services with Succe≈øs, in the Conviction, and (we tru≈øt) Conver≈øion of many Souls: As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Name of Mr. <hi>Tennent</hi> is greatly endear'd to us, ≈øo we be≈øeech our a≈øcended SAVIOUR, the Head

            </p>
            <p>One mu≈øt be cloathed with Charity down to the Foot to think that the≈øe <hi>Reverend Gentlemen</hi> had not ≈øeen Mr. <hi>Tennent's</hi> Sermon at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> &amp;c. which ≈øtands in direct Oppo≈øition to ≈øome Parts of his Doctrine and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct expre≈øt in the≈øe Sermons and el≈øewhere, as I ≈øhall demon≈øtrate in parallel Lines.</p>
            <p>If therefore they had well confidered and compared the one with the other, how is it reconcileable with the <hi>Simplicity that is in CHRIST,</hi> to repre≈øent Mr. <hi>T</hi>‚Äî as ≈øuch a <hi>burning Light,</hi> when his Spots are ≈øo con≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous to the mo≈øt cur≈øory Reader?‚Äî One might expect that if Mr. <hi>Tennent</hi> had not the Ingenuity to ≈øay, <hi>I Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi> that at lea≈øt the≈øe <hi>Reverend Gentlemen</hi> would have attempted a Reconciliation for him, if they think as <hi>Prote≈øtants</hi> generally do that <hi>Infallibility may mi≈øtake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay ought they not to have ≈øaid publickly (as it is affirmed One of them ≈øaid in private Conver≈øation) that Mr. <hi>T. was now come Right:</hi> I ≈øuppo≈øe he meant <hi>Right about;</hi> which implies, that <hi>he had been Wrong.</hi> But it ≈øeems no Man dar'd or car'd to ≈øay unto him, <hi>Why do≈øt thou ≈øuch Things?</hi> Such is the Danger of <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Men's Per≈øons in Admiration, becau≈øe of Advantage.</hi>

            <p>HAVING given the Reader a ≈øummary View of this Reverend Gentleman's incon≈øi≈øtent <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Principles;</hi> I ≈øhall proceed to repre≈øent his Conduct in the ≈øame Light; and to apply his own Words with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect to Mr. <hi>Spangenberg,</hi> a <hi>Moravian Mi≈ø≈øionary</hi> (<hi>Page</hi> 99, <hi>Appendix</hi>) <q>I have ≈øeen and heard of ≈øo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con≈øi≈øtent Conduct in him and others of that Sect, that I can hardly avoid a Jealou≈øy of his Sincerity. And with re≈øpect to Count <hi>Zinzendorf</hi> he ≈øays (<hi>Page</hi> 105,) I am credibly inform'd, that the Count has in the hearing of ≈øeveral Per≈øons denied the Articles offered again≈øt him in the Beginning of this <hi>Appendix,</hi> which he expre≈ø≈øed in <hi>New-Brun≈øwick</hi> as they now ≈øtand, ≈øome of them ab≈øolutely and entirely.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But why doth this <hi>Gentleman</hi> deny to tho≈øe <hi>Moravian Gentlemen</hi> the ≈øame Liberty he takes him≈øelf; to ≈øay, and un≈øay Things as liketh him? More e≈øpecially ≈øeeing he him≈øelf has had greater Advantages of coming to the Knowledge of the Truth in a <hi>Prote≈øtant</hi> Country, than the <hi>Moravian's who have ju≈øt emerged out of the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs and Errors of Propery.</hi>
