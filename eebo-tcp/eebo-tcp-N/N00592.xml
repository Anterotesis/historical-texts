            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The CASE before me is,</p>
            <p>How should we Approve our selves under the <hi>Losses</hi> wherewith Almighty God visits us, in our <hi>Estates;</hi> and how may we Improve those <hi>Losses</hi> unto Spiritual and Eternal <hi>Gains.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Answer to a Case, which I suppose, few or none, can count <hi>unseasonable,</hi> there are these things to be offered.</p>

               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:000722_0006_0FAA0A2E451DCC98"/>I. The first Counsil proper for them that have met with <hi>Losses,</hi> is that which we have, Repeated in our Context here. <hi>Thus saith the Lord of Hosts, Consider your Wayes. Consideration</hi> under our <hi>Losses,</hi> is as needful as ready a way, to the <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification</hi> of those <hi>Losses.</hi> And there are especially two things to be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Considered.</p>
            <p>First, When we have met with <hi>Los<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> we are to Consider the <hi>Hand</hi> from whence those <hi>Losses</hi> come upon us. Briefly, VVe are to Consider the <hi>Hand</hi> of God in all our <hi>Losses.</hi> It was well Considered and Confessed, by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Job,</hi> when be had Lost a fair E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, and there were <hi>Sabaeans</hi> &amp; <hi>Chaldae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> as well as more Natural Accidents, among the Authors of his Losses, in Job 1.21. <hi>It is the Lord that has taken away.</hi> VVe shall be very <hi>Fretful</hi> under our Losses, if we are not very <hi>Thoughtful</hi> under them. Yea, but our <hi>Thoughts</hi> will only increase our <hi>Frets,</hi> if they should only be Employed upon <hi>Second Causes.</hi> This is the <hi>First Rule</hi> for us under our <hi>Los<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>; Let us acknowledge a VVise, and a Just God as the <hi>First Cause</hi> of all. It has been sometimes the Good Speech of a Good Man, <hi>I can take any thing

well at the Hand of God.</hi> As for our <hi>Losses,</hi> they will all <hi>Prove</hi> well if we can <hi>Take</hi> them well; but now, behold how <hi>That</hi> is to be attained. Let us consider, what we are told, in Deut. 8.18. <hi>Thou shalt Remember the Lord thy God, for 'tis he that gives thee power to get Wealth.</hi> And then, Let us Consider, <hi>That when we Loose Wealth, we must Remember the Lord our God; for 'tis he who denies us the power of keeping our Wealth.</hi> Perhaps our <hi>Losses</hi> may rise from the <hi>Fraud</hi> or <hi>Force</hi> of our <hi>Enemies</hi>; but let us Cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>der, It was our God that let Loose those Devourers upon us. 'Tis possible, <hi>Unhappy Casualties</hi> have pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cured us our <hi>Losses</hi>; but let us Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, 'Twas by the Disposal of our <hi>God,</hi> that such Inconveniencies came to pass. It may be partly for this Reason, that our Prophet here once and again men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions unto the People, <hi>The Lord of Hosts,</hi> as concerned about their <hi>Losses</hi>; They were the <hi>Hosts of the Lord,</hi> that were the more immediate and visible Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents of their <hi>Losses</hi>; yea, but those <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficients</hi> were but <hi>Instruments</hi>; and says the Prophet, <hi>It is the Lord of Hosts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self that commanded this Armies to Fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Estates.</hi> VVhatever may be our Losses, and from what Quarter soever

they spring, I beseech you speak not a word of any <hi>Bad Fortune,</hi> in the Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. 'Tis only for Pagans to ascribe their <hi>Losses</hi> unto such a <hi>Blind</hi> Original. Consider every Loss as ordered, not by <hi>Chance,</hi> but by <hi>God</hi>; even by that God who has <hi>Numbred</hi> all our <hi>Hairs</hi>; that, God, without whom not a <hi>Sparrow falls</hi>; that God who does the <hi>Evil</hi> that is done in the <hi>City.</hi> There was a pious VVidow once, that met with sore <hi>Losses</hi> in her Concerns; but you shall now hear <hi>her</hi> Opinion about the true Original of all those <hi>Losses</hi>; in Ruth 1.21. <hi>I went out fall, and the Lord hath brought me home again Empty; the Lord hath Testifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against me, and the Almighty hath Afflicted me.</hi> VVell-Thought on! 'Tis the <hi>Lord Almighty</hi> that <hi>Empties</hi> us, by all the <hi>Losses</hi> that come upon us. Mark what I say; A man will never be a <hi>Looser</hi> by any of his <hi>Losses,</hi> except he be Impatient under them. Now, the best Antidote against Impatience is, to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, <hi>'Tis the Will of God, that I should meet with such Losses as I do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, VVhen we have met with <hi>Losses,</hi> we are to Consider the <hi>Ground</hi> for which those <hi>Losses</hi> com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

[VVe may allude unto <hi>Ezra</hi> 7.26.] It would be a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable</hi> thing for us to <hi>Loose</hi> what is <hi>Comfortable,</hi> if we might be brought thereby to Mourn for, and to Turn from our Sins, and to Humble our selves before God, with a deep <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi> It becomes us then under our <hi>Losses,</hi> to Consider, <hi>What is the Cause of such Dispensations,</hi> and to Supplicate, as in Job. 10.2. <hi>Shew me wherefore thou contendest with me.</hi> In our Text, the Lord makes a, <hi>Why?</hi> upon the <hi>Losses</hi> of the People. Truly, it becomes us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to use a, <hi>Why?</hi> upon our <hi>Losses.</hi> Put the Question, <hi>Why am I thus?

own <hi>Wayes,</hi> we are to Look for the Reasons of our Losses. Particularly, To begin with what lies before us;</p>
            <p>First, Under our <hi>Losses</hi> we may do well to <hi>Consider,</hi> Whether it be not <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of mine House that is wast, saith the Lord of Hosts; and ye run every man unto his own House.</hi> The Neglect of the Ordinances Administred in the <hi>House</hi> of God, is here a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

God would not fill <hi>Their</hi> Houses, because they would not Replenish <hi>His.</hi> They would not <hi>Build</hi> Gods House, &amp; therefore God would not have <hi>Theirs</hi> to flourish. They reckoned every thing too <hi>Much</hi> for the House of God, and so God said every thing was too <hi>Good</hi> for theirs. There is then a twotold miscarriage, after which we should by our <hi>Losses</hi> be made Inquisitive. We should Consider, whether we have duely <hi>Attended</hi> the Ordinances in the House of God.

have honourably Defray'd all the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Expences in the Land for several <hi>Years</hi> together.

We <hi>Loose</hi> what we have, when we go to <hi>Keep</hi> what we should not. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, Under our <hi>Losses,</hi> we may do well to <hi>Consider,</hi> Whether we never made <hi>Idols</hi> of those things, whereof we now undergo the <hi>Losses.</hi> VVhen the Jews were guilty of nefandous <hi>Idolatries,</hi> this was the Judgment of God upon them for those Idolatries, in Ezek. 16 27. <hi>Behold, I have stretched out my Hand over thee, and I have diminished thine Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Food.</hi> As for us, 'tis chiefly one sort of <hi>Idolatry</hi> which we are most prone unto; even that whereof the Apostle speaks, <hi>Coveteousness, which is Idolatry.</hi> When our Hearts come to be Inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:000722_0014_0FAA0A3539DE8B70"/>
set upon things here below, then 'tis that by one <hi>Loss</hi> after another, those things are <hi>Diminished</hi> unto us. To <hi>Love</hi> any of these things extreamly, is the way to <hi>Loose</hi> that thing certainly and speedily. Let any <hi>Guord,</hi> be overvalued, and it won't be long before that <hi>Guord</hi> shall be withered. A miserable Indian at <hi>Mexico</hi> once very solemnly held up a piece of <hi>Gold,</hi> saying, <hi>Behold, this is the Spaniards God!</hi> Even so it may be said about the Cash, or Shop, or House, or Ship, or Field of many a man; <hi>There <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the God of that man.</hi> The man does more depend upon those things, for a Subsistence, than upon the Almighty God Himself; The man will forget God, and all the Works and Laws of Religion, rather than abate of his ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging pursuit after these things. This 'tis to make <hi>Idols</hi> of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Well then, says the Blessed God, <hi>Since this man will make Idols of these things, they shall be Idols in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed!</hi> Now an <hi>Idol</hi> you know is <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> at all. So, we Loose all, till all come to <hi>Nothing.</hi> It was said in Prov. 23.5. <hi>Wilt thou set thine Eyes upon that which is not? For Riches certainly make themselves Wings.</hi> Riches are a Fine, Gay, Speckled Bird; but it is a Bird in the <hi>Bush,</hi> not a Bird in the <hi>Hand</hi>;
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:000722_0015_0FAA0A35EE61EAA8"/>
and it is our setting our <hi>Eyes</hi> too much upon it, that causes its <hi>Flight</hi> from us, that is, our <hi>Loss</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Under our <hi>Losses</hi> we may do well to <hi>Consider,</hi> Whether our <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulness</hi> and <hi>Unfruitfulness</hi> under our Enjoyments, have not given much of Reasonableness unto our <hi>Losses.</hi> All that we have, is but a <hi>Loan</hi> from the Great God unto us. Now, if we be so Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful, that we will not particularly and affectionately Recognize the Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God unto us in such a <hi>Loan,</hi> it is not very Reasonable that we should come to have a <hi>Loss</hi> instead of a <hi>Loan?</hi> Is it famous Threatning of God, in Deut. 28.47, 48. <hi>Because thou servest not the Lord thy God, with Joyfulness, and Gladness of Heart, for the Abundance of all things; therefore thou shalt Serve thine Enemies in Hunger and in Thirst, and in Nakedness, and in the want of all things.</hi> It seems, we come to the <hi>Want,</hi> and the <hi>Loss</hi> of our Former <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance</hi>; Why? Because we do not Serve God with a due <hi>Thankfulness of Heart,</hi> in and for that Abundance. Let me put this unto the Consciences of my Loosing Neighbours! When the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Bajazet</hi> had in one Day Lost

no less than a mighty Empire &amp; Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> who took him Captive, seriously ask'd him, <hi>Syr, Did you ever yet give Thanks to Almighty God, for putting so great a part of His World into your Hands</hi>; whereto the Turk answered, <hi>No, in Truth I never thought of that.</hi> And the <hi>Tartar</hi> then reply'd, <hi>Ungrateful Wretch! then wonder not, that thou hast Lost it all</hi>! Truly so, Let many of us, that have Lost much of the VVorld, be asked seriously, <hi>Did you ever give Express, Hearty, Frequent Thanks to God, for His bestowing these things upon you</hi>? 'Tis to be doubted, that we should be found lamentably defective in this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity; and so you see, the Cost of this Ingratitude. Moreover, All that we have, is the <hi>Means</hi> of <hi>Cultivation</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd by the Great God upon us. We are <hi>Trees</hi> in the Vineyard of God; our Delights are part of the Husbandry, or the <hi>Means</hi> wherewith He Labours, to fetch some of His Praises out of us; and if we are Unfruitful after all, 'tis but Reasonable that we should be deprived of those <hi>Means.</hi> It was threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>Fourthly, Under our <hi>Losses,</hi> we may do well to <hi>Consider,</hi> How we <hi>Got</hi> what we have <hi>Lost.</hi> It is a most memorable passage, in <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.11. <hi>As a Patridge sitteth on Eggs, and hatcheth them not, so he that getteth Riches, and not by Right, shall Leave them in the midst of his Dayes, and at his End shalt be a Fool.</hi> Many a man has been such a <hi>Fool,</hi> as to augment his <hi>Riches</hi> in some ways of Dishonesty; he has either by Fraud or Force made himself a Master of <hi>Gold,</hi> whereto he had no <hi>Right,</hi> by that <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> Rule, <hi>Do as thou wouldest be done unto.</hi> And what comes of it?

            <p n="3">III. Let our <hi>Losses</hi> help to wean us from such things as those whereof we are Bereaved in our <hi>Losses</hi>; and let us not over <hi>prize</hi> what we daily LOOSE.

But our <hi>Losses</hi> do Engrave that Motto upon the Fore heads of all Creatures, <hi>These are Lying Vanities</hi>; and the <hi>Losses</hi> work well, when they take off our Hearts from those <hi>Vanities</hi>? The Apostle writes, in 2 Cor. 4.18. <hi>We Look not at the Things, which are seen; for the Things which are seen, are Temporal.</hi> Our <hi>Losses</hi> do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim, that these things are no more than <hi>Temporal</hi>; and so they should not have
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:000722_0025_0FAA0A4078B25FB0"/>
so much of our <hi>Looks,</hi> nor of our <hi>Loves,</hi> as heretofore. What are all our <hi>Losses,</hi> but the <hi>Wormwood,</hi> wherewith our God would Embitter those <hi>Breasts</hi> of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which we too much fancy to hang upon? 'Tis most suitably pressed upon us, in 1 Cor. 7.29, 30. <hi>The Time is short; It remains that they who purchase, be as though they possessed not.</hi> Even so, Since our Losses tell us, that the <hi>Time</hi> of any Creatures Continuance with us, is but very <hi>short,</hi> Let us not be too fond of any Creature whatsoever. Let us not <hi>Lean</hi> upon these things for the supply of our Necessities: inasmuch as our <hi>Los<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> have told us, <hi>They are but Broken Reeds.</hi> Do not any more imagine, that these things will be sufficient <hi>Reliefs</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our manifold <hi>Sorrows</hi>; our Losses tell us, <hi>They are but Miserable Comforters.</hi> Do not imagine, that these things will be <hi>Remedies</hi> for all the <hi>Maladies</hi> whereto we are Exposed; Our Losses tell us, <hi>They are but Physicians of no value.</hi> It is observable, That when Riches do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Interruption flow in upon us, we grow but the more <hi>Hungry</hi> and <hi>Craving</hi> alter them; <hi>Crescit Amor Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi.</hi> 'Tis well therefore that our God, Orders now and then a <hi>Loss</hi> for us: 'tis to make us think, <hi>Certainly here is not

my Rest! Wo to me, if God put me off with a Portion in such wretched Perishables!</hi> Possibly, if we knew when we had <hi>Enough</hi> of these things, our Heavenly Father would not send so many <hi>Losses,</hi> to be as it were the <hi>Voiders</hi> of our Tables. There are some Considerable Dealers in the VVorld, who are such Mortify'd Men, that they <hi>Stint</hi> their Estates, at a Moderate and Competent Elevation; they Resolve, that they will never be <hi>Richer</hi> than just so far; all that they get over and above, they'l generously give away to <hi>Pious Uses</hi>; and as they Resolve, that they will never be <hi>Richer,</hi> so the Smiles of God upon them seem to Resolve, that they shall never be <hi>Poorer</hi> all their Dayes. Excellent is the Rule that I have seen sometimes given, <hi>Be more Thoughtful how to use what you have, unto the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, than how to gain more.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, if we are like the <hi>Horsleech,</hi> alwayes at, <hi>Give! Give</hi>! Our God often Orders that we <hi>Loose</hi> accordingly. A <hi>Grasp</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter too much, is the <hi>Loss</hi> of all. VVhat shall I say? If our <hi>Losses</hi> did speak no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more Diminutive about the things of this World, than only thus much, <hi>That they are Momentary Things</hi>; yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

for ever with us. We Read concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Rich <hi>Fool,</hi> in Luk. 12.19. VVho said unto himself, <hi>Thou hast Goods Laid up for many years</hi>; but yet that very Night he Lost all. And a <hi>Fool</hi> indeed he was! Truly, after our <hi>Losses,</hi> we shall be most Exemplary <hi>Fools,</hi> if we count any of our Goods, <hi>Laid up for many years.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. Let our <hi>Losses</hi> provoke us to make sure of those things which are beyond the reach of <hi>Losses</hi>; and let us get an Interest in such things as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver can be <hi>Lost.</hi> Could we hear the voice of all our <hi>Losses,</hi> we should find our selves bespoken in such Emphatical Terms as those, in Luk. 10.41, 42. <hi>Thou art Careful and Troubled about ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, But One Thing is Needful; that Good Part, that shall not be taken away.</hi> Have we Lost <hi>Many Things</hi>? It is not worth while to be <hi>Careful and Troubled,</hi> about such Things any Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Let us now be more sollicitous than ever, about <hi>The Good Part, which cannot be taken away.</hi> And what is that <hi>Good Part?</hi> In short, It is a <hi>Part</hi> in the <hi>New Covenant.</hi> Let us Look to it, that <hi>God</hi> be ours; For, <hi>He is from Everlasting to Everlasting.</hi> Let us Look
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:000722_0028_0FAA1046D8A38E60"/>
to it, that <hi>Christ</hi> be ours: For, <hi>He is Yesterday, to Day, and for ever the same.</hi> Look to it, that we have <hi>Grace</hi> in our Souls; for we may say of Divine <hi>Grace,</hi> as 'tis said of Divine <hi>Joy, Nothing shall be able to take it from you.</hi> Let us make sure, that <hi>Heaven</hi> be ours. VVhat said the Apostle, in Heb. 10.34. <hi>Ye took Joyfully the Spoiling of your Goods, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within your selves, that you have in Heaven, a Better and an Enduring Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</hi> Thus, we may, <hi>Take Joyfully the Loss of our Goods,</hi> if we are sure of <hi>Heaven</hi> for our Portion: and if we have true <hi>Grace</hi> in us, there will be that <hi>within our selves,</hi> from whence we may <hi>Know that Heaven</hi> does belong un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us; we shall have an Inchoation of <hi>Heaven</hi> there. A Reverend and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Minister, among the Ancients, having suddenly Lost all that he had in the VVorld, presently Lifted up his Eyes to Heaven, and said, <hi>Lord, Why should I be Concerned about the Loss of Silver and Gold; Thou knowest my All was not here; my All is in Heaven, &amp; blessed be God, I have not Lost Heaven yet!</hi> Bravely Spoken!

Souls rejoyce, <hi>My All is yet safe, as long as my God, my Christ, my Heaven is yet Left.</hi> It would seem strange, if I should say, <hi>A man may grow Rich upon his Losses</hi>; but I do as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert it, and I can Evince it. A man that is Owner of infinitely more than all that this VVorld can afford unto him, is undoubtedly a <hi>Rich</hi> man. But a man may be so Awakened by his <hi>Losses,</hi> that he shall thereby come to be more Acquainted with <hi>God,</hi> more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to <hi>Christ,</hi> more Established in <hi>Grace,</hi> more Experienced at his Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <hi>Warfare,</hi> and more Prepared for the <hi>Inheritance</hi> of the Saints in Light, than ever he was before. Now, here are <hi>Blessednesses</hi> infinitely beyond all that this VVorld can <hi>Enrich</hi> a man withal. Let us Learn more <hi>Godliness,</hi> and more <hi>Contentment,</hi> and we are sure of, <hi>Great Gain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mallem bonum conscientiam, quam plenum marsupium,</hi> said he of old. It was the Advice of our Lord, in Matt. 6.19, 20. <hi>Lay not up for your selves, Treasures upon Earth, where Moth and Rust doth Corrupt, and where Thieves break through and Steal. But Lay up for your selves Treasures in Heaven.</hi> Let our Losses by <hi>Moth,</hi> and <hi>Rust,</hi> and <hi>Thief,</hi> make us more sedulous than ever we

were, in securing of that <hi>Heavenly Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi> which never can be prey'd upon. Since we cannot be <hi>sure</hi> of these things, Let us come to this issue, <hi>I'le give all Diligence to make my Calling and Election sure!</hi> It will be a sad symptom upon us, if we should Serve our Maker, one jot the less, for any of our <hi>Losses:</hi> it would help the Devil to a <hi>Truth,</hi> in that Accusation against us, which he brought with a <hi>Lye</hi> against <hi>Job</hi> of old; <hi>The man is mercenary in his Obedience; Do but put forth thine Hand, and Touch all that he has; and he will have soon have done serving of thee.</hi> No, No; Let us be more prayerful, more watchful, more <hi>Abounding in all the works of the Lord,</hi> because of our <hi>Losses</hi>; and so we shall be vast <hi>Gainers</hi> by the Losses. We shall be <hi>Wise Merchants,</hi> if by <hi>Loosing</hi> of all, we have a faster hold on, <hi>The Pearl of Great Price.</hi> Yea, And who can tell, whether we shall not shelter our selves against all sorts of <hi>Losses,</hi> by our giving to the <hi>Great</hi> Things of Eternity, the <hi>First</hi> and <hi>Chief</hi> Regards? <hi>This</hi> I can tell; that the Lord said unto <hi>Solomon,</hi> in 1 Chron. 1.11. <hi>Because thou hast not asked Riches, Wealth, and Honour; but hast asked Wisdom and Knowledge; Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Knowledge is granted unto thee,

and I will give thee Riches, and Wealth and Honour too.</hi>

            <p n="5">V. The very <hi>Occasions</hi> of our <hi>Losses,</hi> may administer unto us, those <hi>Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> which may Occasion our Gaining by our Losses.

Moreover, Have our <hi>Losses</hi> been by <hi>Carelessness,</hi> or <hi>Imprudence?</hi> Then Reflect, <hi>Lord, Let me use more Earnest Heed, in the Things of my Everlasting Peace!</hi> Finally, Have our <hi>Losses</hi> been, by <hi>Droughts,</hi> by <hi>Rains,</hi> by Unfruitful Seasons?

Surrender of our <hi>Spirits</hi> and our <hi>Bodies</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, must by a parity of Reason also Devote our <hi>Estates</hi> unto Him; and All that we <hi>Have,</hi> as well as All that we <hi>Are,</hi> must come under a <hi>Dedication</hi> to the Lord. Most absurd was the Language of <hi>Nabal</hi> the Churl; <hi>Shall</hi> I <hi>take my Bread, and my Water, and my Flesh, and give it?</hi> Thine, O Senseless Man, How camest Thou by it? It is God that gives us all that we have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by giving it unto us, He has not parted with His own <hi>Right</hi> in it all. No, He still is the <hi>Lord Proprietor</hi> of all; and we own it in that Covenant wherein we Choose Him for <hi>our Lord.</hi> It is therefore most highly Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, That we should be at the <hi>Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the Eternal God, as to what we do with our <hi>Estates</hi>; esteeming our selves but <hi>Stewards</hi> of those Things, whereof our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours call us the <hi>Owners,</hi> and preparing our selves for the Account which we must give of our <hi>Stewardship</hi> unto Him that is, <hi>The Lord of All</hi> Now the <hi>Orders</hi> which our Lord has given us, about our <hi>Estates,</hi> are principally <hi>Two.</hi> The <hi>First,</hi> is in 1 Tim. 5.8 <hi>If any provide not for his own, especially those of his own House, he hath Denied the Faith.</hi> Our Estates are in the first place, to <hi>Feed</hi> and <hi>Cloath</hi> and Cherish our own Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; and we may even <hi>Lay up for our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> a part thereof, if that may be done without the Defrauding of such other Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects as God has required us, as long as we Live, to be helpful unto.

Consecrated unto more <hi>Pious <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ses</hi>; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that we have the Command in the Text now before us.</p>
            <p>In the Context, you may read a Wise Monarch Reflecting upon the <hi>Vanities</hi> and <hi>Miseries</hi> which the <hi>Dead Flies,</hi> (and perhaps the <hi>Maggots</hi>) of Great Men, do oftentimes Plunge a Poor People into. 'Tis often seen, that a Poor People, by the Influence of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy States-men, are brought into inextrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Troubles and Ruines; and our Text, is a Counsil given to such a People. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel is, That Men should be Liberal of their Estates, to <hi>Pious <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ses</hi>; especially at such a Time, as there is like to be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Evil on the Earth,</hi> or, when much Confusion is like to happen in the Land. The <hi>Doctrine</hi> to which I Demand your Attention, is only This,</p>
            <p>DOCTRINE,</p>
            <p>That men ought with a Gracious Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality to Devote a good Proportion of their Estates to Pious Uses.</p>
            <p>My Text Contains almost all, That need be said for the Explication and the Confirmation of this Charitable Truth, and I have Three Questions before me, to Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course upon: WHAT? and, HOW? and WHY?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:000722_0040_0FAA1050F942FB38"/>The first Question before us, is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What</hi> are those <hi>Pious Uses,</hi> that a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of our Estates must be Devoted unto? And under these Four Heads may they be Enumerated, <hi>Paying, Lend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Giving,</hi> and <hi>Forgiving.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, then, The <hi>Paying</hi> of our <hi>Duties,</hi> to the <hi>Publick Charges</hi> of the Place in which we Live, is one of those <hi>Pious Uses,</hi> which our Estates are to be put unto. Something must be paid by us, for the Support of the <hi>Government,</hi> and of the <hi>Ministry,</hi> which God has blessed us withal; the <hi>Publick Servants</hi> of the Place, must by our Estates be made Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to Discharge what. Obligations <hi>we</hi> have Laid upon them; and tho' these be <hi>Pious Uses,</hi> yet we may not place them under the Head of <hi>Alms-Deeds</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they are <hi>Debts</hi> which <hi>Honesty</hi> rather than <hi>Charity</hi> binds us to the Payment of.</p>
            <p>There are <hi>Civil Payments,</hi> which may be Enumerated under the <hi>Pious Uses</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of our Estates. Thus 'tis said in Rom. 13.6. Right. Magi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>trates are the <hi>Ministers of God; Rend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="6" facs="unknown:000722_0041_0FAA1051B7B2E558"/>
Rulers of a Country, must keep up the Administration of <hi>Justice,</hi> and they ought also to see that <hi>School-masters</hi> and <hi>Souldiers,</hi> &amp; other such Officers, do not want their Salaries. The <hi>Chearful Payments</hi> of the <hi>Taxes</hi> needful in order hereunto, are some of the <hi>Pious Uses,</hi> in which our Estates must be Employ'd. There are also <hi>Sacred Payments</hi> which may be An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerated unto the <hi>Pious Uses</hi> of our Estates. Thus 'tis said in Gal. 5.6, 7. <hi>Let him that is taught in the Word, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate unto him that teacheth, in all Good Things; Be not deceived, God is not mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> Laborious and Religious <hi>Ministers,</hi> that spend their Time in Cares for the Souls of those whom God has made them <hi>Over seers</hi> unto, must be so hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somely provided for, that they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come neither <hi>Discouraged</hi> nor <hi>Contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> in their Work; to pretend that we <hi>Love</hi> them and <hi>Prize</hi> them, and <hi>Get Good</hi> by them; and yet think much of their Having <hi>All the Good Things</hi> that we can help them to; the Apostle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates, That this is a <hi>Mocking</hi> of the Almighty <hi>God</hi> Himself; and they that Reproach them as <hi>Hirelings</hi> for Expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, are persons that have no more value for the <hi>Bible,</hi> than for the <hi>Alcoran</hi>; and seem to have Read both
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000722_0042_0FAA105524CE4978"/>
alike. It was observable, That when God stated the <hi>St<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ds</hi> of His Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, it was at such a rate as this: The <hi>Levites</hi> were not a fortieth part of the People, yet had they about thre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Times the Revenue of any one among the <hi>Twelve Tribes</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> But, it seems, to many, that in the <hi>New Test<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament</hi> God has Left His Ministers whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unprovided for! However we are as Loth to <hi>speak</hi> as any body else can be to <hi>bear</hi> of such things. Only it now Lies in my way to say, The Maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Worthy Preachers, is another of the <hi>Pious Uses</hi> appointed for our Estates.</p>
            <p>But, Secondly, The Ready <hi>Lending</hi> of what may Assist those that want <hi>Means</hi> and <hi>Helps</hi> for their <hi>Trades,</hi> is likewise one of the <hi>Pious Uses</hi> which our Estates are to be placed in. It is mentioned as the Property of a Good Man, in Psal. 37.26. <hi>He is ever merciful &amp; Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth</hi>; and in Psal. 112.5. <hi>He shows Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Lendeth.</hi> Indeed, A <hi>Lending</hi> to Idle Vagrants and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, or those whom we may suppose to borrow with the mind of the <hi>Wicked</hi> man, which the Scripture tells us, is, <hi>Never to Pay again</hi>; this is not among the <hi>Pious Uses,</hi> but the <hi>Indiscreet Abuses</hi> of our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>; our
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:000722_0043_0FAA1056857A0DC8"/>
               <hi>Lending</hi> should be to such, as are likely thereby to come into a way of what they may call their <hi>own</hi>; and in that case we have that Precept, in Deut 15.7, 8. <hi>Thou shalt open thy Hand wide un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o thy poor Brother; and shalt surely Lend him s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fficient for his Need.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Thirdly, The <hi>Giving</hi> of what may supply the Necessities, and Relieve the Calamities of the <hi>Indigent,</hi> is among the <hi>Pious Uses</hi> of our Estates. It was the Speech of the Apostle, in 1 John 3.17. <hi>Whos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> has this Worlds Goods, and see his Brother has Need, and shutteth up his Bowels of Compassion from him, how dwelleth the Love of God in him?</hi> We must <hi>Give</hi> of our <hi>Goods</hi> to our <hi>Brethren,</hi> when they have a manifest <hi>Need</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p>There is a more <hi>Spiritual Beneficence,</hi> which our <hi>Giving</hi> is to be sometimes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. <hi>Contributions</hi> for the Propagation of the Gospel, are most <hi>Pious Uses</hi>; and such are <hi>Subscriptions</hi> towards the Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Poor, but Good <hi>Scholars</hi> in the University, or elsewhere; and the same is to be said concerning the <hi>Dispersion</hi> of Bibles, and Catechism<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, and other Devout and Use<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ul <hi>Books</hi> to such as will else be without them. Who knows,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:000722_0044_0FAA1057F7FF3868"/>
but with a <hi>Shilling</hi> a man may so Save a <hi>Soul</hi> for ever? There is also a more <hi>Temporal Beneficence,</hi> which our <hi>Giving</hi> may sometimes be Exercised in. 'Tis among <hi>Pious Uses,</hi> for us to bestow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Distressed, That we may make their Circumstances more easy to them; To Comfort the <hi>Sick,</hi> to Nourish <hi>Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows</hi> and <hi>Orphans,</hi> to Redeem <hi>Captives,</hi> and <hi>Prisoners,</hi> and make mourning Hearts to Sing.</p>
            <p>And unto this File belongs that <hi>Hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitality,</hi> in which Christians must be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary. 'Tis the Apostolical Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Rom. 12.13. <hi>Be given to Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality</hi>; and in Heb. 13.2. <hi>Be not For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful to Entertain Strangers.</hi> We should be as Ready to Treat a Traveller with what Conveniencies we can afford him, as if, Like <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> we should have unknown <hi>Angels</hi> to drop into our Houses.</p>
            <p>But, Fourthly, 'Tis among the <hi>Pious Uses</hi> of our Estates for us, to <hi>Forgive</hi> a <hi>Debt,</hi> when the Hand of God has made the Borrower unable to <hi>Discharge</hi> it. This is that which the Word of God recommends unto us, in Ezek. 18.7. and elsewhere, under that Expression of <hi>Restoring the Pledge.</hi> To <hi>Restore the Pledge,</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:000722_0045_0FAA105875F9CB78"/>
is, To <hi>Remit the Debt.</hi> I confess, 'tis a just Thing, that they who by Bad Courses, render themselves <hi>Insolvent,</hi> should undergo whatever Lash the Law will help their Creditors to inflict up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; for they are a sort of <hi>Cheats</hi> and <hi>Thieves,</hi> the punishment of whom is a thing very Soveraign and Whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some for the whole Body Politick which they belong'd unto. But when the pure Frowns of God, have brought a Debtor Low, it is a commendable thing to say like those Creditors, in Neh. 5.12. <hi>We will Require Nothing of them.</hi> And you know where to find a Terrible Parable delivered by our Lord Jesus, for the pressing of it. Hence 'tis the Charge of our Lord, in Luk. 6.35. <hi>Lend, Hoping for Nothing again.</hi> To take that Simply, were to be <hi>Simple</hi> indeed; it would be to alter the very Nature of <hi>Lending.</hi> But the meaning is, <hi>Lend,</hi> with a Disposition to call for <hi>Nothing again,</hi> in case the Hand of God should Impoverish the Borrower. The Greek word here signifies, <hi>to Despair</hi>; when we <hi>Lend,</hi> we should suppose that the <hi>Debt</hi> may become <hi>Desperate</hi>; and be ready to Release <hi>Principal</hi> as well as <hi>Interest,</hi> if Divine Providence make it so.</p>

               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:000722_0046_0FAA105939115830"/>Here are <hi>Pious Uses</hi> for our Estates. Perhaps you may think I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded <hi>Enow</hi> of them; VVherefore I hasten to the <hi>Second Question.</hi> Which is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>How</hi> are we we to Devote a Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Estates to such <hi>PIOUS USES.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Text, shall give the whole An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to this Enquiry.</p>
            <p>First, We are to do it <hi>Readily.</hi> That is implied in the word, <hi>Cast.</hi> When any <hi>Pious Uses</hi> call for our Estates, we must not have them as though they stuck in our Fingers; No, we are to <hi>Cast</hi> them out of our Hands, as freely as we do that which we <hi>Throw</hi> away.</p>

               </gap> bene, dat multum, qui dat cum mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere vultum.</q>
            <p>This is the Thing Enjoyned in 2 Cor. 9.7. <hi>Let a man Give, not Grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, or of Necessity, for God Loves a Chearful Giver.</hi> We must Resign our Estates, with a most Hearty and Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Cast,</hi> when we are called thereunto; the <hi>Pious Uses</hi> must not wrest &amp; wring
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:000722_0047_0FAA1059F68444B0"/>
them, no, but we our selves must <hi>Cast</hi> them out of our Hands. This is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in Deut. 15.10, 11. <hi>Thou shalt freely give, thy Heart shall not be griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when thou givest; thou shalt open thy Hand wide.</hi> We are thus to Imitate the Bounty of our <hi>Heavenly Father</hi>; &amp; it avails not, as the Apostle says, <hi>To bestow all our Goods to Feed the Poor,</hi> if we have not this <hi>Charity</hi> in our doing of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, VVe are to do it <hi>Helpful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> That which we are to <hi>Cast,</hi> is, <hi>Bread</hi>; it must not be a <hi>Scrap,</hi> much less must it be a <hi>Stone.</hi> It is argued, in Mat. 7.9. <hi>Wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> man, if his Son ask Bread, will he give him a Stone?</hi> Even so, VVe must afford nothing less than <hi>Bread,</hi> unto those whom we are to do Good unto. Indeed, <hi>Goats Hair</hi> and <hi>Ram Skins,</hi> and <hi>Looking-Glasses</hi> may go to <hi>Pious Uses</hi>; but it is only when there are <hi>Uses</hi> for them. VVhen 'tis said, in Mat. 6.11. <hi>Give us this Day our Daily Bread</hi>; it is but a Translation of Prov. 30.8. <hi>Feed me with Food convenient for me.</hi> Thus, we are to afford our <hi>Bread</hi>; that is, to afford what may be <hi>Convenient</hi> for the Designs which our Estates are to be Subservient unto.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:000722_0048_0FAA105C54DB62D0"/>Thirdly, VVe are to do it <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> VVhat is to be <hi>Cast,</hi> must be TH<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Bread:</hi> it must be <hi>Thy own,</hi> and not Another mans. For the Almighty says, in Isa. 61.8. <hi>I hate Robbery for Burnt Offering</hi>; nor will He allow of it, in any other <hi>Offering.</hi> And hence is that word of our Saviour, in Luk. 11.41. <hi>Give Alms of such Things as ye Have.</hi> Otherwise indeed all our Expences this way, must have an <hi>Ichabod</hi> VVritten on them; <hi>Where is their Glory?</hi> VVe must be Lawful <hi>Proprietors</hi> of those things which we go to Serve <hi>Pious Uses</hi> with. And hence the Jews call their <hi>Alms box,</hi> A <hi>Chest of Justice.</hi> VVe may not <hi>Filch</hi> and <hi>Steal</hi> for this End; I have Read of <hi>Pious Frauds</hi> indeed, but no where, of <hi>Pious Robberies.</hi> Hence also, They that are under Authority, as Children and Servants, may not give away what belongs to their <hi>Parents</hi> and <hi>Masters,</hi> without their Approbation; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the <hi>Wife</hi> may do this way <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi> the Consent of her Husband, she should beware of going directly <hi>Against</hi> i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, in such things as these. Hence like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, They that are joyned in <hi>Partner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> may not this Way diminish a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Stock, without the Concurrence of their Partners; and they that alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

               <hi>Owe</hi> more than they are <hi>Worth,</hi> have not so much to do this way as others have. And Lastly, 'tis not for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, VVe are to do it <hi>Sincerely.</hi> Our <hi>Bread</hi> is to be Cast upon the VVATERS; and there are two Notes of Sincerity couched in that Clause. Our Estates must be Cast upon the <hi>Water<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi>; that is, without Hope of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</hi> By <hi>Watery places</hi> here, some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand <hi>Watery Faces</hi>; that is, those whose <hi>Cheeks</hi> are by Affliction fill'd with <hi>Tears</hi>; and indeed a special Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard is to be had unto such in the <hi>Pious Uses</hi> of our Estates. But the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning rather is this; What is <hi>Cast</hi> upon the <hi>Waters,</hi> will either <hi>Sink</hi> away, or <hi>Swim</hi> away; 'tis a Proverb for a thing that we never Look to see again, It is <hi>Projectum in Mare.</hi> Thus, when we are bountiful with our Estates, it should be without any proposal of Requital, from those whom we do Good unto; they should not be Cast upon <hi>Tiding</hi> Waters, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Aim at <hi>Honour.</hi> That which is Cast upon the <hi>Waters,</hi> does not stay to be seen of men. If we Do what good we do, to be <hi>Seen of men,</hi> as the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees did of old, we Cast it not upon the <hi>Waters,</hi> but we Nail it, or Paste it, upon <hi>Pillars.</hi> We must put into <hi>Waters,</hi> not into <hi>Trumpets,</hi> the <hi>Pious Uses</hi> of our Estates. Indeed, our being <hi>Seen of men</hi> therein, should not always hinder us from doing what is to be Done. The Bounty whsch our God will not accept, is not that, <hi>Quae fit et videtur,</hi> but that, <hi>Quae fit ut videatur.</hi> And it is a Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in Mat. 6.3. <hi>Let not thy Right-Hand know, what thy Left-Hand does</hi>; that is, as much as may be, Conceal thy <hi>Alms,</hi> not only from them that are most <hi>Related</hi> to thee at all; but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from those that are most <hi>Assistent</hi> to thee in the Scattering of them.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, We are to do it <hi>Frequently.</hi> We
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:000722_0051_0FAA105F365C13A0"/>
must give to <hi>Seven and also to Eight</hi>; that is, to as <hi>many</hi> as we can; we may not Look upon <hi>Two</hi> or <hi>Three</hi> as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>now to Receive what we have to Give. Hence 'tis assigned as one Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of a Vertuous man, in Psal. 112.9. <hi>He hath Dispersed, he hath Given to the Poor.</hi> We should therefore slip no <hi>Season,</hi> of doing what is to be done for <hi>Pious Uses.</hi> 'Tis the Speech of the Apostle, in Gal. 6.10. <hi>As we have Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, Let us Do Good</hi>; but when have we an <hi>Opportunity?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Truly, We have an <hi>Opportunity,</hi> when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we see an <hi>Indigency,</hi> that we are in a <hi>Capacity</hi> to do something for. Whom soever we see Lying under any <hi>Wounds,</hi> we must like the Compassionate Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan, Dispense our <hi>Oyl</hi> and our <hi>Wine</hi> unto. Say not, <hi>I have done Good unto Seven Miserable People already</hi>; No, think not that Number perfect, but let there be <hi>Eight</hi> Instances of your Bounty, if you can make so many. But there are some <hi>Seasons</hi> for this which have a more certain Revolution with us; and tho' there should be <hi>Seven</hi> or <hi>Eight,</hi> yet we should never count that we see too many, of them. As now, Does God make any <hi>Addition</hi> to our Estates at
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:000722_0052_0FAA106000BC4B20"/>
any Time? Hath any <hi>Adventure,</hi> or any <hi>Husbandry</hi> of ours been smill'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? or has any <hi>Legacy</hi> been bequeath'd unto us? Now is a Season for us to Let <hi>Pious Uses</hi> have something of our Increase. Have we <hi>Got Wealth</hi>? Says <hi>Moses</hi> now in Deut. 8.18. <hi>Now Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Lord thy God.</hi> Have we Gain'd a <hi>Seventh,</hi> or an <hi>Eighth</hi> more than we had? Let <hi>Seven</hi> then, yea, let <hi>Eight</hi> be the better for it. Again, Every <hi>Lords Day</hi> is a Season for this Bounty of ours. Thus we find the Apostle saying, in 1 Cor. 16.1, 2. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Contribution, Upon the First Day of the Week, Let</hi> EVERY ONE OF YOU, <hi>Lay by him in store, as God has prospered him.</hi> But then, <hi>I</hi> know a Place in the World, where many Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds do very little consult their own <hi>Prosperity!</hi> Moreover, A Day of <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation</hi> is another fit Season for it. Hence is that of the Prophet, in Isa. 58.6, 7. <hi>Is not this the Fast that I have Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen? To Deal thy Bread unto the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry?</hi> Their <hi>Feeding</hi> upon our Kindness, is one of the best Articles in our <hi>Fas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> before the Lord. When we <hi>Fast</hi> out of <hi>Piety,</hi> we must see that others do not <hi>Fast</hi> out of <hi>Poverty.</hi> Once more, A Day of <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:000722_0053_0FAA1060CB0C00C0"/>
fit Season for it. On such a Day, it was Commanded, in Neh. 6.10. <hi>Go your way, Eat the Fat, and Drink the Sweet, and Send Portions unto them, for whom Nothing is prepared.</hi> VVhen we are <hi>Praising</hi> of our God, we should then be <hi>Blessing</hi> of our Neighbours; &amp; we should Engage them to Rejoyce with us in the Goodness of the Lord; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t is, <hi>A Day of Sending Portions one to another, and Gifts to the Poor.</hi> Though these Occasions come oftner than <hi>Seven</hi> or <hi>Eight</hi> times in a year, yet let our <hi>Portions</hi> be given on them all.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, VVe are to do it <hi>Prudently.</hi> You may place a large Remark upon the divers C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Something must be kept for our selves; and as we say, <hi>Charity must begin at Home.</hi> Again, We must not Give All to <hi>Some,</hi> and none to <hi>Others.</hi> VVhen we have been helpful to <hi>Seven,</hi> we must also see to it, that <hi>Eight,</hi> may have a Room in our Helpfulness unto them. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more; 'Tis not a <hi>Pittance,</hi> but a <hi>Portion</hi> that we are to Give.

            <p>First, We are to Give <hi>Speedily</hi>; and avoid all Needless Delayes in the Doing of it. Sais the Wise man, in Prov. 3.27. <hi>Say not unto thy Neighbour, Go, and Come Again, and To morrow I will give thee, When thou hast it by thee.</hi> We know, <hi>Bis dat qui c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:000722_0055_0FAA1062372C8AD0"/>And then, Secondly, We are to Give <hi>Suitably.</hi> And this not only for the <hi>Measure</hi> in which, but also for the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> to which, we Give. One says very truly, <hi>Turpissimum Genus perdendi est Inconsulta Donatio.</hi> And our Saviour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, about our Giving, in Luke 18.12. It must be, with a <hi>Distribution.</hi> We must give in the first place to our <hi>Needy Kindred:</hi> and as for others, we must have Respect first unto the <hi>Houshold of Faith,</hi> though we must also <hi>Do good unto All.</hi> As for your <hi>Common Beggars,</hi> 'tis usually an Injury and a Dishonour unto the Country, for them to be Countenanced; as for those that Indulge themselves in <hi>Idleness,</hi> the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Command of God unto us, is, <hi>That we should Let them Starve</hi>; and as for those that when they Get, will melt and wast our Money in <hi>Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> 'tis a Sin to supply those Monsters with what may be Fuel for such a Beastly Vice. Let never any thing but a <hi>Nought,</hi> stand for them, in the <hi>Books of Accounts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis after this manner that we are to <hi>Do Good</hi> with our Estates. But this brings us to the Third Question; VVhich is,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:000722_0056_0FAA1062F728F0F0"/>
               <hi>Why</hi> are we thus to Devote a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of our <hi>Estates</hi> to <hi>PIOUS USES.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Text will give you a double Reason for it.</p>
            <p>The First Reason is, <hi>Thou shalt find it after many days.</hi> There will a Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, yea, an Eternal <hi>Recompence</hi> be made unto us, for all our <hi>Liberality.</hi> Some think, that here is an Allusion to Ventures at <hi>Sea</hi>; Our Liberality sends <hi>Ventures</hi> forth, upon the <hi>Waters,</hi> and there are very Great and Rich Returns made thereof. But Let us a Little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scant upon this <hi>Recompence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The words may be Rendred, <hi>Thou shall find it in Multitude of Dayes.</hi> This is indeed one <hi>Recompence</hi> of Liberality; there is a <hi>Multitude of Dayes,</hi> or a <hi>Long Life,</hi> which the God of Heaven often favours a Liberal man withal. It was a Speech once used unto a cruel Churl, in Dan. 4.27. <hi>Shew mercy to the Poor, and it may be a Lengthening out of thy Tranquillity.</hi> Behold, a Receipt, <hi>pro pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longanda vita</hi>; Let us be <hi>Liberal,</hi> as our Father <hi>Abraham</hi> was; and that's the way for us, Like <hi>Abraham</hi> to Live,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:000722_0057_0FAA106591D7CF60"/>
till a <hi>Good Old Age,</hi> till we are <hi>Old men, and full of years.</hi> It has been often observed, that very <hi>Liberal</hi> men, use to be <hi>Long Lived</hi> men. 'Tis the full and firm word of our God, in Psal. 41.1, 2. <hi>Blessed is he that Considers the Poor; the Lord will preserve him, and keep him alive.</hi> Thus we shall find our <hi>Bread after many Dayes</hi>; we shall have <hi>many Dayes</hi>; this <hi>Bread</hi> will keep us <hi>Alive,</hi> till <hi>many Dayes</hi> have passed over us. But I dismiss that Sense of the words; and only Lay down this Conclusion.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Liberality</hi> is wonderfully Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to them that use it, and this, for a <hi>Long while</hi> afterwards.</p>
            <p>Our Lord assures us, in Mat. 10.42. <hi>Whosoever gives but a Cup of Water, shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

VVe have the word of <hi>Him that cannot Ly,</hi> to assure us, that we shall not be <hi>Loosers</hi> by our Liberality; that our Estates thus Laid out, <hi>Non pereunt sed parturiunt</hi>; that tho' our <hi>Bread</hi> be <hi>Cast</hi> on, yet it shall not be <hi>Lost</hi> in, the VVaters.

               </gap>, there are two Metaphors, with which our Good God Condescends to give us this Assurance. One Metaphor is that of, <hi>Sowing.</hi> Thus 'tis said, in 2 Cor. 9.6. <hi>He that Soweth bountifully shall Reap bountifully.</hi> Let a man be <hi>Liberal</hi> with what he has, and he shall be sure of a Good <hi>Crop</hi>; the <hi>Bread</hi> Cast on the <hi>Waters,</hi> will prove but a <hi>Seed</hi> cast into an <hi>Earth</hi> more fertile than that of which we read that <hi>Isaac,</hi> did <hi>Receive an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fold.</hi> Another Metaphor is that of <hi>Lending.</hi> Thus 'tis said, in Prov. 19.17 <hi>He that hath pitty on the Poor, Lendeth to the Lord</hi>; and then we may take for granted what follows, <hi>That which he hath given, will He pay him again.</hi> Let a man be <hi>Liberal,</hi> and he shall have the Counterbond of the most High <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

His own Hand acknowledges the Receipt of it, and stoops to Charge himself a <hi>Debtor</hi> on the Score.</p>
            <p>First then, There is a <hi>Recompence</hi> in <hi>This Life,</hi> which the Liberal man, is made partaker of. And this every way; for, to be particular; Even his <hi>Inward man,</hi> shall have the Comfort of his Liberality. Thus 'tis said in Prov. 11.25. <hi>The Liberal Soul shall be made Fat.</hi> God will give a Thriving, Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing, Comfortable Soul unto him; and fill him with the <hi>Peace, which pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth Understanding.</hi> His Liberality shall also pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cure good Circumstances to his <hi>Outward man.</hi> Not only will that word be fulfill'd unto him, <hi>He that giveth to the Poor shall not Lack</hi>; but also, God will bless him with an <hi>Increase</hi> of his <hi>Enjoyments.</hi> Thus 'tis said in Prov. 3.9, 10. <hi>Honour the Lord with thy Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; and so shall thy Barns be filled with plenty</hi> I could mind you of poor little Trades-men that have come to Live upon their Rents, by the <hi>secret Blessing</hi> of God upon their Callings, when they have Conscientiously Laid aside a certain part of their Income, for the Lord. And God will bless him with a <hi>Success</hi> of his <hi>Businesses.</hi> Thus 'tis said
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:000722_0060_0FAA1068636FEE10"/>
in Deut. 15.10 <hi>Thou shalt surely give to the Poor, because that for this Thing, the Lord thy God will bless thee in all thy Works.</hi> I have known a <hi>Ship-master,</hi> who upon going to Sea, would still car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a considerable Purse of Money unto a Faithful Minister, to be by him Laid out for God; and a strange <hi>Blessing</hi> did Accompany him! Yea, The <hi>Children</hi> of such a man, do rejoyce in the Fruits of his Liberality. Many Gripple <hi>Hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fasts</hi> in the World, object against Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, <hi>That they must Lay up for their Children.</hi> But say I, <hi>Lay out,</hi> and that's the way to <hi>Lay up.</hi> Let your Bread be Cast on the <hi>Waters,</hi> and it will be safely Reposited in <hi>Gods Bags</hi> for your Children after you: Do you give a <hi>Portion</hi> to <hi>Seven,</hi> and also to <hi>Eight,</hi> and then though you have <hi>Seven</hi> or <hi>Eight</hi> Children, you have made sure of a <hi>Portion</hi> for every one of <hi>them.</hi> Your Widows, will have <hi>Meal</hi> and <hi>Oyl</hi> very like to he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s of old. Be like <hi>Jonathan,</hi> and your poor <hi>Mephibosheths</hi> will have the Harvest of it. You shall see, I speak nothing without Book, and therefore you shall have a Scripture for this too; 'tis that in Psal. 37.26. <hi>The man that is ever merciful, and Lends, his Seed is Blessed after him.</hi> But</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:000722_0061_0FAA1068FA9E06F8"/>Secondly, There is also a <hi>Recompence</hi> in the <hi>Life to Come,</hi> which the Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral man is made partaker of. 'Tis testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd unto us, in 1 Tim. 6.18, 19. That they who be <hi>Ready to Distribute, Willing to Communicate,</hi> therein, <hi>Lay up in store for themselves a Good Foundation against the Time to Come, and Lay hold on Eternal Life.</hi> As for all the <hi>Riches</hi> that we keep with our selves, they have no <hi>Foundation</hi> for them; any Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Storm will carry them away. But the <hi>Treasures</hi> which a true Liberality shall put out of our Hands, have such a <hi>Foundation,</hi> that we may thereupon Build our Hopes of <hi>Life Eternal</hi>; Not that any <hi>Good Works</hi> of ours do Merit <hi>Life Eternal,</hi> but they are a Blessed Evidence and Argument of our Claim unto it; so that a Liberal Man, when he comes to Dy, may say, <hi>Lord, Thou knowest that my Heart was never Set upon this World; and I take that for a sign, that thou hast another and a better World for me to be happy in for ever.</hi> Our Lord says about the Liberal man, in <hi>Luke</hi> 16.9. When <hi>he fails, they w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="27" facs="unknown:000722_0062_0FAA1069C604F848"/>
the last. But then, the <hi>Saints</hi> whom we have Succoured, and the <hi>Angels</hi> whom we have Imitated here, will bid us Welcome to an <hi>House Eternal in the Heavens.</hi> Our Lord also says unto the Liberal man, in Luke 14.14. <hi>Thou shalt be Recompenced at the Resurrection of the Just.</hi> It is impossible to tell, what Satisfactions, the <hi>New Jerusalem</hi> will bring to such a man, at the <hi>Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Just.</hi> But indeed, after the Stupendous Transactions of the <hi>GREAT DAY,</hi> throughout the Days of Eternity still all our present Acts of Liberality, will be Lying by us, like so many Good <hi>Bills of Exchange,</hi> which our mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful God, for the sake of Christ Jesus, will be for ever Owning and Paying of. Then shall a Liberal <hi>Onesiphorus</hi> be sufficiently Retaliated by the Lord. This, This will be <hi>after many Dayes</hi> indeed! yea, after more than many millions of Ages, we shall make a greater Gain of the <hi>Poor,</hi> than <hi>Joseph</hi> did of a <hi>Famine</hi> in the Days of old. How runs the Final Sen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nasmuch as you were Liberal to my Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted Members in the former World.</hi> (Mark) He says not, <hi>For you have bin Orthodox in your Opinions,</hi> or, <hi>You have

been Eminent in your Professions,</hi> or, <hi>You have been Abundant in your Devotions</hi>; No, <hi>But you have been Liberal to the Miserable.</hi> But then,</p>
            <p>The Second Reason is, <hi>Thou knowest not what Evil shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Would we be <hi>Delivered in Six Troubles,</hi> as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> Expresses it, and in <hi>Seven</hi> would we have <hi>no Evil Touch us</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Then Let us give a <hi>Portion to Seven, and also to Eight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Let us a little penetrate into the Force of this perswasive.</p>
            <p>First then, Since, <hi>Thou knowest not what Evil shall be upon the Earth,</hi> hence thou knowest not how long thou shalt Enjoy thine <hi>Estate,</hi> and it is Wisdome to Husband it well, before it be <hi>Too Late.</hi> There may quickly come such <hi>Evil</hi> upon us, that either our <hi>Estates</hi> may be taken from us, or we from our <hi>Estates.</hi> Let us therefore be Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, in doing what Good we can, whilst
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:000722_0064_0FAA106B39331100"/>
as it is said in Prov. 3.27. <hi>Thou hast it by thee.</hi> Since the Times are like to be Dangerous, 'tis best for us, to put as much of our Estates into those Hands, where no Violence can spoil us of them; now such are the Hands of God, and of His People; <hi>Manus pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perum est Christi Gazophylacium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Since, <hi>Thou knowest not what Evil shall be upon the Earth,</hi> it were well for thee to do what may Compose &amp; Settle thy Heart in the anxious pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of all that <hi>Evil.</hi> Now this will be done by being truly Liberal of those <hi>Estates,</hi> which are the things that so much make us afraid of <hi>Evil</hi> Times. Look into Psal. 112.7, 9. where 'tis said, He <hi>shall not be Afraid of Evil Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings</hi>; Why not? It is added, <hi>He hath dispersed, he hath given to the Poor.</hi> You see the <hi>Liberal</hi> man, has a Cordial a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Fears</hi> of <hi>Evil</hi> Dayes. For, The Great God has promised, either to <hi>Preserve</hi> him from that <hi>Evil</hi> that shall <hi>be upon the Earth</hi>; as in Psal. 41.1. <hi>Blessed is he that Considers the Poor, the Lord will deliver him in Time of Trouble</hi>: Or else, to <hi>Supp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="30" facs="unknown:000722_0065_0FAA106BF7EA3D50"/>
Obscurity.</hi> In short, since thou <hi>knowest not what Evil shall be upon the Earth,</hi> hence thou <hi>knowest</hi> not but thou thy self must come into such a Condition as may want the Liberality of other men; What is <hi>Their</hi> Case to day, may be <hi>Thine</hi> to morrow. If thou wouldest then fall among <hi>Liberal</hi> Persons, be <hi>Now</hi> such an one thy self. 'Tis the promise, in Mat. 5.7. <hi>The Merciful shall obtain Mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this Practical Discourse has been <hi>Milk'd,</hi> and not <hi>Squeez'd</hi> out of the Text before us. Little can remain to be said in the</p>
            <p>APPLICATION.</p>
            <p>They that Fear God will find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves mov'd by these things, to a most Exemplary Liberality, in Devoting a fit proportion of their <hi>Estates</hi> to <hi>Pious Uses.</hi> I do not now take upon me, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the <hi>Quota pars,</hi> or what <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion</hi> of our Estates ought thus to be improved. Only, I will tell you, what our Father <hi>Jacob</hi> counted a due Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="5 letters">
                  <desc>•••••</desc>
               </gap>; we read in Gen. 28.20. <hi>He Vowed a Vow unto God, saying, of All
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:000722_0066_0FAA106D0B765380"/>
that thou shalt give me, I will surely give the Tenth unto thee.</hi> And if <hi>Abraham</hi> judged a <hi>Tenth</hi> due unto <hi>Melchisedeck,</hi> why should we judge any less to be the Dues of his Antitype, our Blessed Saviour? I think a <hi>Tenth</hi> too Little for some men, at some Times; however, if they that are never so <hi>Poor,</hi> would make a <hi>Trial</hi> for so much, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, they would never have any Temptation to Leave it off. Shall I tell you? I have known those, who in their Childhood, while they were not yet Owners of near Ten Shillings, have begun the <hi>Trial</hi> of it, and God hath so Smiled upon them ever since, that they never had any Temptation or Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to do otherwise. But that which is rather to be pressed is, That we mind the <hi>Call</hi> and <hi>Voice</hi> of <hi>Providence</hi> in this matter; and then let a Self-denying, and a Well-mortifyed <hi>Heart</hi> be our Director in it. Let us not be unmindful, That the Honour of our Profession much depends upon our Liberality for <hi>Pious Uses.</hi> It may shame us to see, that these who are under the Influence of none but a False Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, can have it said of them, in Isa. 46.6. <hi>They Lavish Gold out of the Bag.</hi> And what?

I was indeed very glad, when I read in Dr. <hi>Willet,</hi> That since the Reformation, in one threescore years there was in only Three Cities of <hi>England,</hi> no less than a million of Money openly and visibly Expended in <hi>Pious Uses,</hi> besides what was done more secretly among them. So far has the Liberality of <hi>Popery</hi> been Exceeded by the Protestants. But <hi>we</hi> that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be the best Metal'd, and most Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined Protestants, ought certainly to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed all others, in the <hi>Sacrifices which God is well pleased with.</hi> To have done.</p>
            <p>First, I have only this one <hi>Counsil</hi> to Subjoyn unto all the Premises; 'Tis this,</p>
            <p>Let us not imagine that the <hi>Pious U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> of our Estates, Deserve any Good at the Hands of the Holy God; but Let us Depend upo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the Lord Jesus Christ alone for <hi>Our</hi> and <hi>Their</hi> Acceptance with Him. When some told the Dying <hi>Herbert</hi> of his many <hi>Good Works,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, <hi>Yea, These are Good Works, if Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the Blood of the Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> VVhen we have done our best, Let us be sensible of that in Luke 17.10. <hi>We

are Unprofitable Servants.</hi> One of the most Liberal men that ever was in the VVorld, would say, <hi>I have often Turned over my Accounts, but I could never find the Great God Charg'd a Debtor there.</hi> So Let us think, and place the whole Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and Solace of our Souls, in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>But is there not Secondly, sad cause of <hi>Reproof</hi> to too too many in the midst of us?</p>
            <p>Many there are, That squander away a vast deal of their Estates, in <hi>Profane, Wicked, VVretched Uses</hi>; and in the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of some Lust or other; but as to <hi>Pious Uses</hi> they do Little or Nothing at all; No, they make an hideous grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling at all that should go that way, and feel as much <hi>Heart blood</hi> as <hi>Money,</hi> going from them. Yea, I have heard this Assertion Demonstrated, That what is needlesly Expended at the <hi>Taverns,</hi> in many Towns, would abundantly Defray all the Publick Charges of <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>School,</hi> and <hi>Common-wealth</hi> too, which the Towns would be happier, if they were honester, in the payment of. Here, surely are persons that <hi>Forget</hi> that Proverb, in Prov. 11.24. <hi>He that witholdeth more than is meet, cometh to
