            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HESE words are part of the ſong of Zacharias, at the birth of John. The good man expreſſes his faith in Chriſt, who was quickly to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, as
<q>the mercy promiſed to our fathers,</q>
in ſending whom God did
<q>remember his holy covenant, the oath which he ſware to our father Abraham.</q>
The character, in which he views the Meſſias, is that of a glorious deliverer coming, in the fullneſs of ages, to reſcue his people out of the hand of all their enemies. Whatever views Zacharias might have of Chriſt, as a ſpiritual ſaviour, coming to deliver mankind from the tyranny of ſin and ſatan: As alſo from the empire of death and the grave, which have
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:011130_0004_0F857F856A6DD100"/>
reigned from the fall; yet, it is not, that I know of, at all abſurd to ſuppoſe that he expected, when the Meſſias ſhould appear, that he would alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver Iſrael from their temporal enemies, from the Roman yoke, under which they were groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. This was the general expectation of the Jews, and even the diſciples of Chriſt, on every occaſion, betrayed their raiſed expectations of ſuch a glorious deliverance.</p>
            <p>The text naturally leads me to diſcourſe on the enemies of God's people, and the ways and means, the times and occaſions, when and by which, Chriſt accompliſhes the deliverance of his people from their enemies. But my views, at this time, are not ſo extenſive; what I propoſe, as not unſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for our meditation this day, is to take a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe view of the dealings of God with his people in <hi>this</hi> land; and to ſhew by what means he hath delivered <hi>us</hi> out of the hands of our enemies.— Having done which, I ſhall point out our great obligations, being thus delivered out of the hands of our enemies, to
<q>ſerve him in holineſs and righteouſneſs all the days of our lives.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. I ſhall briefly conſider the enemies that God's people in this land have been called to engage, the tryals and difficulties they have met with, the dangers they have eſcaped, and how God, at one time and another, hath graciouſly appeared for them, and delivered us out of the hand of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. In proſecution of this deſign I ſhall ſtudy all poſſible brevity, begging your candour and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, hoping what I ſhall ſay will not be unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, eſpecially to our young people, who have
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:011130_0005_0F857F861CBEDF18"/>
not had conſiderable advantages to know the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful acts of the Lord. And, from the whole, may we ſo feel our hearts affected with the great things God hath done for us, as to lead us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and engage us to
<q>make them known to our children, that the generations to come may know them—that they may ſet their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments.</q>

            </p>
            <p>The whole continent of America was, to the antients, an unknown land. It is not quite 300 years ſince the firſt diſcovery was made of this part of the world, <note n="(b)" place="bottom">Columbus made the firſt diſcovery of America 1492.</note> the Spaniards began their ſettlements and the conqueſt of the vaſt kingdoms of Mexico and Peru, about an hundred years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our fathers came into this country. <note n="(c)" place="bottom">Cortes ſailed from Spain 1518, and the next year began the conqueſt of Mexico.</note> It is not certain that ever any European was at New-England before the year 1602. Some feeble at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts were made to effect a ſettlement, in ſeveral parts of this country, but none ſucceeded until the year 1620; when the adventurers landed at Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth and began a ſettlement there, which may fitly be called the beginning of New-England. No conſiderable additions were made to the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, until the diſtreſſing times in England lead many worthy and ſerious perſons to ſeek a quiet habitation, in theſe deſolate parts of the earth.</p>
            <p>It is a truth, impoſſible to be denied, that the ſpiritual tyranny, under which our fathers groaned, and their being inhibited the worſhip of God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:011130_0006_0F857F897897CEE8"/>
to the light of their own conſciences, was the cauſe of their leaving their native country, to plant themſelves in this howling wilderneſs. It was this abridgment of the rights of conſcience that began and mightily aſſiſted in the ſettlement of this country. The oppreſſion under which a valuable part of the nation groaned, has, in the hand of conſummate wiſdom, proved, in its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, a great bleſſing to the world, and the occaſion of a vaſt addition to the Britiſh empire, and glory, as well, as of a glorious enlargement of the kingdom of the redeemer. The Lord our God hath turned the curſe into a bleſſing.—He meant it for good to ſave much people alive, and to raiſe up a new people, as the ſtars of heaven for multitude.</p>
            <p>A few years after the ſettlement of New-England began, the troubles in England were greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and arbitrary meaſures were driven on, both in church and ſtate. Arch-biſhop Laud, and the ruling eccleſiaſtics of that day, then drove a multitude of conſcientious puritans from their country. After ſome fruitleſs attempts had been made to form ſettlements in other places, in the year 1629 a conſiderable number of perſons (350) ſeated themſelves at Salem, and eſtabliſhed a church there. And the next year John Winthrop, and Thomas Dudley, Eſqrs; afterward governours of the colony, and ſeveral gentlemen of diſtinction, with divers worthy Miniſters, and above 200 paſſengers arrived in <hi>this</hi> Bay, began their ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and founded churches: And by the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual acceſſion to their numbers, and the arrival of parties from divers places in England, in the ſpace
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:011130_0007_0F857F8A57995220"/>
of ſeven years, there were, not only ſettlements be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan and churches erected, in Charleſtown, Boſton, Dorcheſter, Roxbury, Cambridge and Watertown, but, in that time, great numbers had emigrated as far as the fertile banks of Connecticut river, and planted the now populous and flouriſhing towns of Sprinfield, Hartford, Windſor and Weathers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field: And, by the coming over of new inhabitants, the foundations were laid of the antient colonies of New-Haven &amp; Connecticut, ſince formed into one.</p>
            <p>But what I deſign is not to give you an hiſtory of the progreſſive improvements of the country, ſo much as to point out the hardſhips they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, and the enemies out of whoſe hand God did deliver them.</p>
            <p>It is impoſſible to deſcribe the difficulties, ſtraits, hardſhips and perils which attend the ſettlement of a new country; eſpecially, at the diſtance of a thouſand leagues from a civilized people. It muſt, in the firſt place, have been a moſt affectionate parting, that they had with their native country, their houſes and lands; their friends and relatives, whom they were forſaking without any proſpect of ever meeting again in this world. The thought of venturing over an extended ocean, then very much unknown, muſt have been terrible to perſons that never went to ſea, and, eſpecially, to women of tender minds. The proſpect of venturing on an unknown and barbarous ſhore, to the firſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers, muſt have been quite perplexing. But when all the tryals and difficulties were paſſed through, it was in hunger and cold, in peril and fear, that they began and proſecuted their ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:011130_0008_0F857F8B20C61B30"/>
It is impoſſible for us to conceive what many ſuffered by the fatigues of a long voyage, by cold and famine, in a deſolate country, where they were immediately expoſed to the ſeverities of a rigid climate, without any convenient habitations to cover them. The hardſhips they underwent brought many to their graves within a few months after their arrival. Of the firſt 350 who arrived at Salem, not leſs than 100 died the following win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, of diſeaſes, principally, brought upon them by the hardſhips they endured. Of the people, who firſt arrived at Plymouth, two or three months ſwept half of them into the grave. Truly, we cannot but admire the hand of God that ſupported and animated them under theſe tryals. Their principal comfort was, that, with all the diſtreſſes of a new country, they found themſelves out of the reach of prelatical tyranny; they could enjoy God in his ordinances.</p>
            <p>America, when firſt diſcovered, was found, in every part of it, inhabited by a ſavage ſwarthy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The learned have been much puzzled to determine the original of the natives of this vaſt continent. Some have conjectured they were ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally Tartars who found a northern path into America; and ſome that they are the deſcendents of the ten tribes, carried into captivity by Salmaneſer, and planted in the northern kingdoms of Aſia. <note n="(d)" place="bottom">2 Kings 18.11.</note> Others derive their origin from the antient Pheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians who are famed for their early ſkill in navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, who certainly ſent forth colonies in very early ages. Others, and perhaps with greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, ſuppoſe that they were at different times
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:011130_0009_0F857F8BD23E16F8"/>
and on various occaſions, either accidentally, or by deſign, tranſplanted from various parts of the other continent; but when and how no man can tell. After all our enquiries their origin is quite problematical. However, this is certain, they muſt have been here many ages; for we find them ſcattered throughout every part of North and South America: They inhabited, not only the ſea-coaſts, but the vaſt inland country alſo. The Spaniards found millions of Indians in the countries they conquered, and the vaſt kingdoms of Peru, and Mexico ſeem to have had the marks of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable antiquity. Our fathers, upon their arrival in this country, found every part of it was, or had been, peopled with tribes or Indians, who could give no account of their original. One thing is very remarkable in the diſpenſation of providence; a few years before the arrival of the people at Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, there is no doubt but God was pleaſed to ſend a dreadful ſickneſs among the natives, who were before very numerous, and probably would have beſtired themſelves to hinder ſtrangers from making ſettlements in their country. By this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation, it is ſaid, great numbers were ſwept off, and ſome whole tribes became, in a manner, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct. The Maſſachuſetts tribe, particularly, are ſaid to have been reduced from thirty thouſand, to three hundred fighting men. Some ſay nine tenths of the barbarians, through the country, were ſwept off, and the land was, in a manner, depopulated. Some have conjectured, becauſe the ſmall pox has proved ſo mortal to Indians, that this was the diſtemper which depopulated the country, but the Indians give an account of the diſeaſe that does not ſo well agree to the ſmall pox. According to
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:011130_0010_0F857F8C1FC25348"/>
them it was a peſtilential putred fever. Some however, think it was the plague, and tell us the ſavages ſhewed thoſe ſcars which proved it to be the plague. But whatever the deſtemper was, it was a wonderful providence thus to prepare the way for our fathers. When the moſt high would bring over a vine and plant it, he prepared room before it, and by his own hand cut off the heathen, who might otherwiſe have diſappointed the deſigns of our fathers.

            <p>At the beginning of theſe ſettlements Heaven was pleaſed wonderfully to lay reſtraints upon the remaining ſavages, ſo that the Europeans gained a peaceable ſettlement among them.
<q>When they were but a few men in number, yea very few and ſtrangers—he ſuffered no man to do them wrong, yea he reproved kings for their ſakes, ſaying, touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.</q>

This further conduced to the ſafety of the people, and, probably, hindred the plotting of the natives to deſtroy their new neighbours.</p>
            <p>It was not long, however, after their arrival, that our fathers found the ſavages, with ſtrong pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of friendſhip, conſpiring, in one place and another, to cut them off. In the firſt year after their arrival in this colony, when a mortal ſickneſs
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:011130_0011_0F857F8CDAC44B80"/>
was daily leſſening their numbers, when there was not corn enough to feed them a fortnight, they were alarmed with the news of a general conſpiracy of the Indians to extirpate the Engliſh. Only two years after (viz. in 1632) a conſpiracy of the eaſtern Indians to cut off our ſettlements was diſcovered, and by a ſtratagem prevented. The ſame year the whole plantation was under fearful apprehenſions of being driven off by the French, by order of Cardinal Richlieu, which put them on providing for their own defence. And it was nothing but the want of union among themſelves that reſtrained the ſavages from breaking up all our ſettlements, which were generally utterly defenceleſs.</p>
            <p>The firſt open war with the ſavages was what is called the Pequod war in 1637. The tribe of that name was ſettled in Connecticut colony, and were very miſchevious to the Engliſh, falling upon them in their fields and in their journeys, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſeveral murders among them. The ſeveral Engliſh plantations found it neceſſary, for their own defence, to carry on a war with this tribe, with their united force. This war was carried into the Pequod country, where their garriſons were deſtroyed and their houſes burnt; 700 of that tribe were killed or taken priſoners, with very little loſs on the ſide of the Engliſh: In ſhort, the whole nation was in a few months totally extirpated, and this deſtruction ſtruck ſuch a terror into the other tribes, that they came and begged for peace, and the land had reſt for near forty years.</p>
            <p>During the ſeven firſt years from the ſettlement of the Maſſachuſetts-Bay, there was a great flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:011130_0012_0F857F8DFAEE6918"/>
into the country, ſo that in a few years not leſs than 4000 planters had fixed themſelves up and down in the country, and laid the foundation of many flouriſhing towns and villages in New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. Above ſeventy miniſters accompanied them, generally, learned and pious divines: About forty churches were gathered, and the foundation of that ſchool of the prophets was laid, which by its annual ſtreams, hath made glad the city of our God— the wilderneſs began to be ſubdued, orchards were planted, and laws were enacted for the government of the infant ſtate.</p>
            <p>But even in its infant ſtate, New-England was not without its enemies at <hi>home,</hi> as well as in its own boſom. A.B. Laud, the grand enemy of civil and religious liberty, while he was perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting good men at home, kept a jealous eye upon New-England—and employed enemies, falſe bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren ſecreted among themſelves, to give notice of every thing that paſſed; eſpecially of what might be improved to the diſadvantage of the colony. He envyed the puritans an aſylum in theſe parts of the earth, and was plotting their ruin.</p>
            <p>As early as 1637, he procured an order of court to prohibit the exportation of inhabitants to New-England, at which time ſuch great men as Pym, Hampden, Sir Arthur Haſelreig, and Oliver Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel, afterward lord protector of England, were prevented from ſettling themſelves in this land. God in his providence reſerved them for more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant ſervices in their own country. And after all the calumny and reproach, which have been caſt on their memories for more than a century of
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:011130_0013_0F857F8E792F7338"/>
years, the world is obliged to acknowledge their greatneſs, and that to them the nation is greatly obliged for the important liberties it hath ſince en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed. —After the breaking out of the civil war, the cauſe of exile was, in a manner, taken away; the acceſſion of inhabitants greatly ceaſed, and ſome returned from <hi>this,</hi> to their native country: Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the reſtoration of Charles II. when the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt proteſtant diſſenters was renewed with greater vigour than ever.</p>
            <p>In 1642, there was a general deſign among the Indians to cut off the Engliſh inhabitants. They were to go, under pretence of trade, in ſmall parties to the Engliſh houſes, and, while ſome ſecured the arms, others were to perpetrate the dreadful maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre. This horrid conſpiracy was diſcovered by ſome of the Indians themſelves. The diſcovery cauſed a dreadful conſternation: But, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary pains taken by the inhabitants to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any ſurprize, the ſavages were diſcouraged from their bloody attempt.</p>
            <p>In 1653, a general alarm was ſpread through the colonies, by the information given by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, from ſeveral quarters, that the Dutch were privately ſolliciting the Indians to a general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy, in order totally to extirpate the Engliſh. But the diſcovery of the plot was, probably, the means of preventing its execution.</p>
            <p>For the ſpace of near 40 years, from the Pequod war, though New-England was ſometimes alarmed and put into great conſternation, yet, in general, the country had reſt, and there was, during this time, a ſurprizing increaſe of inhabitants; until

the breaking out of that, which is commonly called Phillip's war, becauſe it was begun and carried on by an Indian prince of that name, a mortal enemy to the Engliſh. He reſolved on nothing leſs than the total deſtruction of the Engliſh. For this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he invited all the barbarous tribes to join him, furniſhed them with arms, and ſuddenly began the moſt diſtreſſing war that ever New-England felt. This war
<q>endangered the very being of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, and it was a queſtion with ſome, whether the Indians would not prevail to a total exterpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Engliſh inhabitants.</q> 
               <note n="(g)" place="bottom">Lieut. Gov.

            <p>It was in 1675, June 24. the war was actually begun, by an attack on the town of Swanzey, and the murder of ſeveral of the inhabitants. The troops of the colony engaged and were overpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered by numbers.

The brave diſtreſſed inhabitants frequently engaged the enemy, but were generally overpowered by numbers, and obliged to retreat with loſs. It was at this time Capt. Lothrop, with his whole company, ſave ſeven or eight, conſiſting
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:011130_0015_0F857F8FDE918020"/>
of eighty young men, belonging to the county of Eſſex, were cut off, in an engagement with ſeven or eight hundred Indians, between Deerfield and Hatfield. This was a heavy ſtroke on the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to which they belonged.</p>
            <p>Theſe depredations of the enemy united the Colonies in an expedition againſt a ſtrong fortreſs of the ſavages, in the Narraganſett-country. It was attacked by a thouſand men, taken and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed after an obſtinate reſiſtance, in which five or ſix hundred Indian houſes were burnt, and, in many of them, the women and children periſhed. Some of the enemy confeſſed they loſt 700 fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men that day, beſides 300 more, who died of the wounds they received, or the hardſhips they underwent. This battle proved bloody, and coſt the Colonies the lives of ſix brave captains, <note n="(i)" place="bottom">Johnſon, Davenport, Gardiner, Gallop, Siely and Marſhall.</note> and eighty-five private men. The whole number of killed and wounded was about 170; and the whole army was in the utmoſt danger of periſhing, in their retreat, through hunger and cold. This action was on December 16th.</p>
            <p>It was hoped, that ſuch a ſignal defeat would have cooled the courage of the remaining ſavages, and diſpoſed them to peace. But the event was quite otherwiſe. The barbarians, reduced to an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt deſperate condition by cold and famine, and inſtigated by Phillip, took the firſt opportunity of joining their forces, and, being encouraged by the governour of Canada, early on the following ſpring

(1676) made a furious onſet upon divers towns, <note n="(k)" place="bottom">Feb. 10.

It was about this time Capt. Pierce was drawn into ambuſhment and ſlain, with his whole company of fifty Engliſh and ſeveral Indians; and Capt. Wadſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth, marching to relieve Sudbury, was cut off with his whole company of fifty men: The place is ſhewn, to this day, where they lie buried in one grave. Many perſons were taken by the ſavages, and ſome put to death with torments too dreadful to be named.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time that theſe weſtern parts of the Colony endured the miſeries of a bloody war, the eaſtern country, which before this time had conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable ſettlements, was groaning under the ſame calamity. All the country, eaſtward of Wells, was deſtroyed by fire and ſword. Such was the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable ſituation of our country at that day, that that of the Prophet was peculiarly applicable to our land,

            <p>This was an awful ſeaſon indeed—our fathers ſaw their country at once invaded on every ſide: Scarce any plantation was out of danger. Look

which way they would, the ſmoke of their country aſcended up, as the ſmoke of a great furnace. Men, women and helpleſs babes, fell a ſacrifice to barbarian cruelty. Great numbers of the braveſt men in theſe infant plantations fell in battle. The enemy had ſignal advantages againſt them. No ſooner had they made their unexpected onſets, but they were retired into woods and mountains, where it was impoſſible to follow, or overtake them. Hitherto the enemy had been generally victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous —A darker and more dreadful cloud never overſpread New-England. No man thought his life ſecure: Nothing was talked of but fire and ſword. All forts of men put on ſackcloth, and lay in aſhes. Day after day was ſpent in faſting and prayer.
<q>The prieſts, the miniſters of the Lord, wept between the porch and the altar, ſaying, ſpare thy people, O Lord, and give not thine he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage to reproach, that the heathen ſhould rule over them: Wherefore ſhould they ſay among the people, where is their God?</q>

            </p>
            <p>God was jealous for his land, and pitied his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; in the midſt of judgment did he remember mercy—The triumphing of the heathen was but ſhort. Our troops, in ſeveral bloody encounters, were victorious. The enemy were purſued to their lurking places, multitudes of them were put to the ſword, great numbers were taken priſoners.—The death of Phillip, who was ſlain by an Indian that had deſerted from him, together with the loſſes they had ſuſtained, and their diſtreſs for want of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and amunition, quite diſheartened the ſavages, and ſeveral tribes begged for peace: So that, in two years, this bloody war was brought to a period;
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:011130_0018_0F857F94623EBD28"/>
which, tho' for a time ſo formidable to our fathers, yet, through the good providence of God, broke the power of the ſavage tribes—multitudes were ſlain, many were executed as rebels, great numbers were made ſlaves, and ſome were ſent into ſlavery to other countries: The natives were never able to recover themſelves.</p>
            <p>Thus ended this diſtreſſing war, which once threatned the total deſtruction of the Colony. Theſe were not indeed ſuch mighty battles as we read of in hiſtory, nor ſuch as have ſince deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the fate of America, but they were the ſtruggles of an infant colony.—Many brave men— many brave young men, expired in this diſtreſſing war; their names deſerve to be had in perpetual remembrance.</p>
            <p>But what pity! what relief had our fathers from the mother country, under all theſe diſtreſſing ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities! Was the royal ear open to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints? Was any kind of relief afforded, at a time when the ſavages awfully threatned their total de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction? Were troops or ſhips or money ſent to their relief? —No —If they cried there was none to hear. The heart of a licentious prince was hardned to all their diſtreſſes; his ears were ſhut to their cries, but open enough to the vile and malevolent miſrepreſentations of their worſt enemies. On the very year when the coloniſts were conteſting with the natives the poſſeſſion of the country, at the time when they ſtruggled hard to preſerve their footing in New-England, complaints were ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and a proſecution ſet on foot againſt them, which at length iſſued in the loſs of all the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the royal charter.</p>

               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:011130_0019_0F857F9521047FD8"/>The royal charter which encouraged our fathers to ſettle themſelves in this country, gave them to expect civil &amp; religious liberty in a greater degree, than their fellow ſubjects then enjoyed it in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. The country was claimed by the crown of England <hi>only</hi> by right of diſcovery. To encourage the ſettlement, an incorporation was thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, but was purchaſed of the crown at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of two thouſand pounds ſterling. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, it was no longer than the next year after the arrival of the people in this Bay, in 1631, that there was an attempt to vacate it; but it happily proved unſucceſsful. And again, four years after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, 1635, the charter was attempted, but ſtill the attempt proved unſucceſsful. In 1638, there was a formal demand of the charter to be given up, and a judgment was obtained, that the liberties of the corporation ſhould be ſeized into the king's hands. But, through the goodneſs of God, the execution was never compleated: The change of times in Old England ſaved the priviledges of New. At the reſtoration of king Charles, 1660, the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of their liberties arouſed themſelves, and laid heavy and grievous complaints againſt the Colony, in order to have their priviledges taken away.

            <p>But ſtill the people ſaw their civil rights and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal property in the hands of a tyrant.—Swearing by the book was introduced, and ſuch as ſcrupled it were fined and impriſoned.—Exorbitant and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable fees were exacted.—The titles to lands were queſtioned, in order to oblige men to take out new patents, at unreaſonable prices.—Eſtates, in ſome inſtances, were unjuſtly alienated, and made over to thoſe, that had no right to them in law or juſtice.—Property became every day more and more precarious: Under ſuch a government,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:011130_0024_0F857F9B30BA3E40"/>
no man could call any thing his own. Towns were forbidden, at their peril, to aſſemble, except once or twice a year. The governour, with four or five, laid taxes on the people, according to his ſovereign will, and the officers who refuſed to aſſeſs them, were impriſoned and fined — The inhabitants were cruelly forbid to garriſon their own houſes, in a time of war.—A multitude of lives were loſt, in a fooliſh and fruitleſs expedition to the eaſtern frontiers.—Such were the arbitrary meaſures pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing by a ſet of wretches, who were making their fortunes out of the country's ruin. The people had no where to cry but to him who rules in the armies of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth. <hi>He</hi> was graciouſly pleaſed to appear. The glorious revolution, which dethroned James, and placed a proteſtant king and queen on the throne, ſat New-England at liberty from the cruel op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of arbitrary government.</p>
            <p>It muſt be remembered, that while the country was ſtripped of its invaluable priviledges, and groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under arbitrary government, they were likewiſe carrying on a war with the ſavages, which ſeems to have fallen chiefly on the eaſtern frontiers. This war began in 1687, and laſted ten years; in all which time, our frontiers were harraſed, and, every year, more or leſs deſtruction was made on our borders. It was during this war, viz. in 1690, that this brave people, who, one would have thought quite diſheartned, raiſed and ſent 700 men, who accompliſhed the reduction of Port-Royal, which was given up ſeven years after, at the treaty of Ryſwick. In the ſame year an expedition was formed, and carried on, under the command of Sir
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:011130_0025_0F857F9BD9FCF828"/>
William Phips, for the reduction of Canada. The expedition proved unſucceſsful, &amp; the conſequences of it diſtreſſing to the people. A thouſand brave young men loſt their lives, by a train of diſaſters in that unfortunate undertaking. Mourning and woe were brought on the country, and a load of debt which proved pernicious to them and their poſterity.<note n="(w)" place="bottom">A paper currency begun at that time.</note>

            <p>Liberty is the moſt ardent wiſh of a brave and noble people. They bear the yoke with reluct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and never fail to improve the firſt opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to caſt it off. The ſacred thirſt for liberty brought our fathers hither. They endured the yoke of ſlavery with great uneaſineſs. The firſt hints that William and Mary had aſcended the throne, arouſed them to ſpirited meaſures; they ſeized and impriſoned the inſtruments of their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and preferred their humble and earneſt ſollicitations for the reſtoration of their charter-priviledges. After three or four years the preſent charter was obtained, which, though it enlarges the king's prerogative, and brings us to a nearer dependence on the crown, we nevertheleſs conſider as of ineſtimable worth. It's priviledges we wiſh, and pray may be tranſmitted a fair inheritance to our children after us.—Only I would obſerve, that one of our miniſters, the Rev. Dr. Increaſe Mather, was a principal agent in obtaining the preſent charter. His praiſe is in all the churches: His name will be remembered thro' many generations.</p>
            <p>The arrival of the new charter, in 1692, did not put an end to the diſtreſſes of this unhappy people.

<q>many of the prieſts and levites, and chief of the fathers, that had ſeen the firſt houſe, when the foundation of this houſe was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice, and many ſhouted for joy.</q> 
               <note n="(x)" place="bottom">Ezra 3.12.</note> In like manner, on the arrival of the new charter, while ſome rejoiced at the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of many of their former priviledges, others mourned bitterly the abridgment of the important liberties they had enjoyed under the former char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and forms of government. The ſtate of the country was on other accounts greatly diſtreſſed.— The ſea-coaſts were infeſted with the enemies pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateers, ſo that few of our veſſels could eſcape. The inland frontiers, from eaſt to weſt, were har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed with enemies, French and Indians.—The late unſucceſsful expedition againſt Canada, had expoſed the country to the reſentment of France, and bro't a diſtreſſing load of debt upon the people, and the government were in the utmoſt perplexity to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for carrying on the war. Laſtly, amidſt all, the minds of the people were filled with horror at the breaking out of what is called the witchcraft; a ſcene dreadful to be thought on! Many of the people were credulous, and believed all they heard, and the few that believed all was impoſture, and deſign, were afraid to reveal their ſentiments, leſt they ſhould be accuſed themſelves, for in that caſe they ſaw little probability of eſcape.</p>

in all the civilized nations of Europe; many, even in the laſt century, in the moſt enlightned parts of Europe, were put to death for ſuppoſed witchcraft. The unhappy tragedy, acted by our miſtaken fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, was principally confined to the county of Eſſex; where the proſecution was carried on, for ſeveral months, with miſtaken zeal and unremitting vigour. The anguiſh, the horror and conſternation of the people were beyond imagination, when their relatives, their friends and neighbours were accuſed, impriſoned: Many of them put on ſolemn tryal for life, and divers condemned and executed. No one could look upon himſelf as ſafe: Many fled their country for fear, and, before the impoſture was diſcovered, ſuch a ſhocking tragedy was acted, as is enough to make the ears of every one that heareth to tingle. <hi>Nineteen</hi> perſons were condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and executed for witchcraft. <hi>One</hi> was preſſed to death for refuſing to plead. <hi>Eight</hi> more lay under the ſentence of death. <hi>Fifty</hi> confeſſed and were pardoned. <hi>One hundred and fifty</hi> were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, and <hi>two hundred,</hi> being accuſed, fled for their lives, <note n="(y)" place="bottom">See Hutchinſon on witchcraft, p. 58.—In that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent treatiſe the reader will find the vulgar notions of witchcraft learnedly diſproved, the true nature of witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, as ſpoken of in the law of Moſes, clearly opened, with an ingenious account of the witch of Endor.</note> May heaven forgive the innocent blood, that was ſhed; may future ages learn wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from the miſtakes of former times: Rather, much rather, may time draw a dark vail over this ſcene of deluſion.</p>

            <p>In 1694, the enemy attacked a village in New-Hampſhire, <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Oyſter-River.</note> and killed and captivated 100 per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.

            <p>In 1695, the ſavages continued their depredati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and committed ſeveral murders on the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, and, no farther from home than Billerica, they killed and captivated fifteen perſons.</p>
            <p>On the next year, 1696, the Engliſh-fort at Pemaquid, the ſtrongeſt garriſon in the eaſtern country, was taken and demoliſhed. The news created great terror through the country; and it was then expected the enemy would have marched weſtward and brought fire and ſword into the bowels of our country. A conſiderable army <note n="(c)" place="bottom">Five hundred men.</note> was raiſed and ſent to oppoſe them; but God was pleaſed to deliver the country from their fears, and nothing extraordinary was attempted by the enemy. The inhabitants, all along the frontiers, were obliged to ſhut themſelves up in garriſons, and were greatly hindred from their labours. The Indians were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where upon the watch, and when an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity preſented, ſeized or killed thoſe that ventur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed abroad.—We, who ſit every one under his own

            <p>In 1697, we were threatned with a powerful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion from France.—The king of France had his heart much ſet on this expedition. A large fleet was ordered to ſail from the ports of France, as early in the year as poſſible, to attack Boſton. A numerous army from Canada was deſtined to join the fleet, on the eaſtern frontiers: The army was ready to march at a few days warning. The fleet actually ſailed from France, and arrived in America. The deſigned invaſion was known in the country, and every day expected, for ſeveral weeks toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. A report was ſpread in Boſton, that a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable fleet had been ſeen on the coaſt. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, as well they might be, were put into conſternation and amazement. They expected every day to be attacked; there were no hopes of a Britiſh fleet to aſſiſt them. The beſt preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were however made, by a brave and diſtreſſed people, to receive their enemies—The militia was held in readineſs to march to the ſea-coaſts, and their principal fortreſſes were put into the beſt poſture of defence. The alarm continued for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral weeks, all which time, they daily expected to be attacked. But Heaven was pleaſed graciouſly to appear for their help, and, by a train of diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments, fruſtrated the deſigns the enemy had formed againſt us. Beſides, by reaſon of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations making in Canada, to ſtrike this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant

blow, our frontiers had quiet until the latter part of the year, when a party of the enemy fell upon Lancaſter, and killed the miniſter, <note n="(d)" place="bottom">The Rev. Mr. Whiting.</note> and twenty or thirty of the inhabitants.</p>
            <p>On the beginning of the next year, 1698, the Indians ſurprized Andover and Haverhill, burned ſeveral houſes, and killed many of the inhabitants, leading ſome into dreadful captivity: And the treaty of <hi>Ryſwick,</hi> which reſtored peace to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and France, did not quickly deliver our fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers from the Indian enemy. Several attacks after, this were made on our eaſtern &amp; weſtern borders.<note n="(e)" place="bottom">On Kittery, York and Hatfield.</note>
            </p>
            <p>In the year 1698, after many years inceſſant war with the French and Savages, peace was reſtored to our frontiers. But it's duration was ſhort. For on the breaking out of Q. Anne's war with France, 1703, New-England was again involved in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive and diſtreſſing war, which, during the courſe of ten years, required the utmoſt exertion of this people: It's weight fell principally on this unfortunate Colony. It grieves me to repreſent to you the ſufferings, diſtreſſes and diſappointments of this unhappy people. But, as it may remind us of our obligations to God, who has often appeared for us in ſeaſons of peculiar diſtreſs, I ſhall give you a ſummary view of the ſeries of calamities, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fel us, during that long war.</p>
            <p>The firſt conſiderable onſet of the Indians was on the town of Deerfield, on the night following the 28th of February.—In the dead of night the whole town was attacked, by 300 French and
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:011130_0031_0F854E66856B6F98"/>
Indians. They ſlew about forty perſons, and, the next morning, leaving the houſes and barns in flames, they took their departure, carrying away about 100 captives, among whom was the miniſter of the town, <note n="(f)" place="bottom">Rev. Mr. Williams.</note> a native of <hi>this place,</hi> with his wife and five children, leaving two of his children dead, and his houſe in flames.—The tender huſband was quickly ſeperated from his feeble ſpouſe, and, not long after, had the affecting tidings that ſhe, fatigued with travel, had the hatchet of her cruel maſter ſtruck in her brains.—Oh! the diſtreſs that an affectionate huſband muſt have felt at ſuch a relation as this!—Several expenſive expeditions were undertaken, which had no great effect, unleſs that they might ſtrike terror into the ſavages, and prevent their ſo frequent onſets on our ſettlements.</p>
            <p>In 1704, the enemy were very active, and made ſeveral attacks upon our unwalled villages. Three or four hundred French and Indians came down to Lancaſter, and burnt the meeting houſe, and many dwelling houſes, and aſſaulted the garriſons, but were not able to take them. Many other towns in this, and a neighbouring government, <note n="(g)" place="bottom">Almſbury, Haverhill, York, Exeter, Dover, &amp;c.</note> ſuffered by the incurſions of the ſavages; and the country was in a perpetual alarm.</p>
            <p>In 1705, I meet with no conſiderable devaſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the enemy. As it was a time of war, the people on the frontiers muſt have lived in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual fear; and, if they ventured into their fields, it muſt have been in great fear and jeapordy of their lives. But,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:011130_0032_0F854E671CE5FEB8"/>In the beginning of the next year, 1706, ſeveral hundreds marched from Canada, to fall upon the frontiers of New-England. The intelligence of this deſign gave a dreadful alarm, through all the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers the people not knowing where they would fall on. Probably the enemy divided their forces; for they fell on ſeveral places nearly at the ſame time. During the courſe of this year, Dunſtable, Sudbury, Chelmsford, Exeter, and divers other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, had ſome of their inhabitants killed, or taken; and a party ventured down to Reading, within a few miles of our metropolis. Who can conceive the diſtreſs and anguiſh of a whole country, every where lying open to the cruelties of barbarous ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages, aided and puſhed on by our mercileſs neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours the French!</p>
            <p>In 1707, an unſucceſsful expedition was formed againſt Port-Royal. <hi>This</hi> Colony ſent a thouſand men, which greatly increaſed the burden of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed people. Nor did this expedition at all ſecure our frontiers. The ſavages ſtill continued their ravages, and committed many barbarous murders on the defenceleſs inhabitants, <note n="(h)" place="bottom">As at Exeter, Kingſton, Dover, York, Berwick, Wells, Caſco-Bay, &amp;c.</note> and had confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence enough to venture down to Marlborough, an inland, town where they did ſome damage.</p>
            <p>In 1708, the country was alarmed with advices, that the governor of Canada was collecting all the tribes of ſavages he could, for a powerful invaſion of ſome part of New-England, to be commanded by French officers. Providence ſtrangely diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed their plan, and great numbers of Indians gave over the enterprize. However, on the 29th
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:011130_0033_0F854E67E3244AC8"/>
of Auguſt, about 200 of the enemy fell upon Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verhill, killed the miniſter, <note n="(i)" place="bottom">The Rev. Mr. Rolfe.</note> and thirty or forty perſons; burnt great part of the buildings, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, carrying ſeveral into captivity.</p>
            <p>Nothwithſtanding <hi>this</hi> Colony had been harraſſed with long and perplexing wars, yet, upon an inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation from the Crown, that an expedition was deſigned againſt Canada, they chearfully raiſed and kept in pay, for ſeveral months, their quota of troops <note n="(k)" place="bottom">Viz. 900 men.</note> and tranſports, until advices were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that the intended expedition was laid aſide. This was an additional diſappointment and misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to a people, already ſinking under a load of debt. And, through the courſe of this year, the ravages on the frontiers were continued; many places were attacked, on the eaſtern and weſtern frontiers. A large party of the enemy attacked Deerfield, when the inhabitants were juſt returned from captivity—ſeveral other places had their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants picked off, by parties of Indians, diſperſed all over the frontiers.</p>
            <p>In 1710, the New-England Colonies ſent four regiments to reduce Port-Royal; in which they were aſſiſted by ſeveral of the king's ſhips. The deſign was accompliſhed—During the whole ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, notwithſtanding the expence of the expedition to Port-Royal, the Colony were obliged to keep large parties in pay, to ſcour the woods and protect the outer ſettlements. But, notwithſtanding all their diligence, the frontiers were frequently alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and miſchief was done in ſeveral places. Marl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:011130_0034_0F854E68AAD2B138"/>
and Chelmsford were infeſted with ſava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and, at the latter, a brave officer was ſlain. <note n="(l)" place="bottom">Major Tyng.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Nothing further could be expected from an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted people, yet, perhaps encouraged by the ſucceſs of the preceeding year, and well knowing that they were never to expect any laſting peace and ſafety, ſo long as Canada was in the hands of the French, upon advice of an expedition form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt Quebec, <hi>this</hi> Colony, with almoſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paraled readineſs and diſpatch, furniſhed two regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, their quota of troops, with proviſions, and joined the king's troops arrived at Boſton, on the projected expedition. The whole armament, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of fifteen ſail of men of war, forty tranſports and 7000 troops ſailed from Boſton, July 30, 1711. They arrived in the river St. Lawrence, where, in the night, eight or nine ſhips were wrecked upon the rocks, and a thouſand of the king's troops periſhed in the waves. This dreadful blow, at once, put an end to the expedition. The navy and regular troops returned to England, and the New-England forces returned aſhamed and confounded. The diſappointment and vexation was very great. The public debt was increaſed, and become now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt inſupportable. The country was ſtill left to the mercileſs ravages of French &amp; Indians. Some pious minds give over all hopes of ever reducing Canada.
<q>So many attempts blaſted plainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated, as they conceived, that providence never deſigned the whole northern continent of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca for one European power.</q>
And, to add ſtill to the misfortune, it ſoon appeared, that every me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod was taken to miſrepreſent and abuſe this loyal
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:011130_0035_0F854E696F8B0540"/>
Colony, and caſt all the blame of the failing of the expedition on us. Proper meaſures were taken to clear this Colony from this undeſerved abuſe. A journal of all the proceedings was ſent home, in which, it was truly aſſerted, that one <hi>fifth</hi> part of the inhabitants of the province, fit to bear arms, were in pay this ſummer. And further, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat their misfortunes, this year, a conſiderable part, the middle and beſt inhabited part, of the town of Boſton, was lain in aſhes.</p>
            <p>Early on the ſpring of the next year, 1712, the ſavages renewed their aſſaults on the frontiers, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and captivating in one place and another. Their incurſions were continued until 1713, when peace took place between the contending powers of Europe: Soon after which the Indian tribes entred into a treaty of peace, and profeſſed themſelves the very obedient faithful ſubjects of the Crown of Great-Britain.</p>
            <p>We are come to a period memorable in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of Europe, for the peace of Utrecht. <hi>This</hi> country had now, with very ſmall intermiſſions, been in a ſtate of war for near forty years. In thoſe long wars the country loſt five or ſix thouſand of their braveſt youth; and it was found, that in the ſpace of fifty years, the number of inhabitants in the province had not doubled. The defence of the frontiers, and the numerous garriſons and fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they were obliged to maintain, together with the various expenſive expeditions in which they were engaged, without any relief or compenſation from the crown,
<q>muſt have occaſioned ſuch an annual burden, as was not felt by any other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:011130_0036_0F854E6A1D646230"/>
of Great-Britain; and the merit of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of that day ought never to be forgot.</q>

            </p>
            <p>From the year 1713, the land had reſt and peace for about ten years. But, in 1723, the Indians broke out into a war (to which they were urged by the French) that laſted about two years. During this war, the ſavages harraſſed the frontiers from eaſt to weſt; falling upon divers towns at the eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, killing &amp; captivating many of the people.<note n="(n)" place="bottom">Scarborough, Falmouth, Berwick, Wells, Arundel, &amp;c.</note> They alſo fell on the weſtern towns, particularly Rutland, where the miniſter of the town <note n="(o)" place="bottom">The Rev. Mr. Willard.</note> fell a ſacrifice to their rage. The Engliſh engaged the Indians in the Eaſt, with various ſucceſs, for ſome time, until their ſucceſs in deſtroying the Indian ſettlements at Norridgewalk, with a great part of the tribe of that name, induced the ſavages in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, to treat of peace, which was eſtabliſhed by a ſolemn treaty in 1725. <note n="(p)" place="bottom">Commonly called Lieut.

            <p>From the peace in 1725, the country enjoyed peace for nineteen years; viz. until the declaration of war between England and France, in 1744; when all our frontiers were involved in the dangers and perplexities of an Indian war. Five hundred men were immediately impreſſed and ſent to guard the expoſed plantations.—I am not able to give a minute account of the onſets and murders com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:011130_0037_0F854E6BD5CC98D0"/>
by the ſavages in this war, and I am ready to think proper care was not taken to preſerve the memory of thoſe events.—But this many of us well remember, many valuable ſettlements were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, and burnt up, by the enemy; and many of our people were ſlain or carried into captivity.— During this war, viz. in 1745, the repeated at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of the enemy upon Annapolis-Royal, (which was preſerved from falling into their hands, by a ſeaſonable reinforcement of the garriſon with 200 men from this province) and the imminent danger our trade and fiſhery were expoſed to, arouſed the martial ſpirit of the New-England Colonies to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in an expedition againſt Louiſburg, a ſtrong fortreſs on the Iſland of Cape-Breton. The expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition was planned by the Governor of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, <note n="(q)" place="bottom">Lieut.

Many of us remember the readineſs with which thouſands of our worthy inhabitants engaged themſelves in that hazardous enterprize.—God was pleaſed to hear our fervent prayers, and ſucceed our endeavours. A train of favourable, unforeſeen and even aſtoniſhing events facilitated the conqueſt of that important fortreſs. This ſucceſs of New-England arms was very important, in it's conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences: It was the price that purchaſed the peace of Europe. Cape-Breton was the <hi>ſingle</hi> equivalent for all the conqueſts of France in the Netherlands. This conqueſt coſt the Colonies dear. For though but a few were killed in the ſeige, yet the ſickneſs, that raged among the troops in garriſon after the conqueſt, ſwept off many hundreds of our worthy inhabitants.</p>

               <pb n="40" facs="unknown:011130_0038_0F854E6C9AAB50F8"/>The ſucceſs of the expedition againſt Louiſburg put the miniſtry upon forming a plan for the total reduction of Canada. <hi>Theſe</hi> Colonies had loſt great numbers of their beſt men, in the conqueſt and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſoning of Louiſburg; and that expedition, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the war on the frontiers, had ſunk them, eſpecially <hi>this</hi> province, deep in debt. To which I may add, as a diſcouraging conſideration; all former attempts on Canada had proved unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. Nevertheleſs, upon an intimation of the roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al pleaſure, the Colonies readily engaged in the great undertaking, and even exceeded the roval requiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the number of troops they engaged to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy, <note n="(r)" place="bottom">8200 were engaged by the Colonies.</note> The troops of <hi>this</hi> province were ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably prepared, and waited, with impatience, the arrival of the forces from Europe. But, unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the Colonies, the deſign was laid aſide at home, and all our expences and preparations prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in a manner, fruitleſs; at leaſt they only ſerved to defend our own frontiers, and to protect Nova-Scotia, where our people were inſidiouſly attacked by the French and Indians at Minas, and 160 were killed and wounded in one night. In a word, in ſtead of a fleet and army from home to undertake the conqueſt of Canada, <hi>we</hi> were left to the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful apprehenſions of a powerful fleet and army, ſent out from France, with orders to bombard and lay waſte all our maritine towns; without any conſiderable force to reſiſt them.</p>
            <p>England was not more alarmed with the Spaniſh Armada, in 1588, than Boſton, and the other North-American ſeaports were, with the arrival of this powerful armament in their neighbourhood.
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:011130_0039_0F854E6D1F527A78"/>
The fleet conſiſted of ſeventy ſail, whereof fourteen were capital ſhips, and twenty were ſmaller men of war; enough, indeed, to ſtrike terror into the braveſt minds.—Every meaſure for defence, that was in our power, was immediately purſued—our principal dependance from abroad, was the ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able arrival of a Britiſh fleet; but herein our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations were diſappointed. But when our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance failed, Heaven was pleaſed to hear the prayers of a diſtreſſed people, and kindly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took our deliverance. He, that hath all nature in his power, ſent mortal ſickneſs into the enemy's fleet and army, and ſo diminiſhed their numbers, that they were obliged to burn ſeveral of their ſhips, for want of men to navigate and defend them. Their general, a Duke of France, <note n="(s)" place="bottom">Duke De Anvil.</note> died on a ſudden, or rather laid violent hands on himſelf. Some of the ſhips we loſt in a violent ſtorm, and others taken in their return to France. So that this great Armada, which employed near half the navy of France, was in a great meaſure deſtroyed.—Pious men could not but ſee and admire the hand of God, interpoſing for our deliverance: We, literally, ſtood ſtill and ſaw the ſalvation of God.—
<q>He ſaw that there was no man,—therefore his own arm brought ſalvation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>During the ſhort peace between the two laſt wars, our plantations flouriſhed, and our ſettlements extended themſelves further into the wilderneſs. But our reſt was ſhort: We were ſoon called to arms. The neceſſity of the times required us to furniſh much greater armies than ever we had done before. France, inſtead of conforming to articles
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:011130_0040_0F854E6F764C7788"/>
of agreement for terminating all diſputes in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, was forming the vaſt plan (or rather proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a plan long ſince laid) of driving the Engliſh out of all North-America; at leaſt of ſubjecting this vaſt extent of dominion to the crown of France. For this purpoſe, they were building fortreſſes on our frontiers, impriſoning Britiſh ſubjects; they attacked our garriſons, and were daily filling their Colonies with regular troops, in order to execute the project formed as Verſailes. Theſe perfideous tranſactions occaſioned the laſt war, which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed begun, in 1755, though not formally declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed until the next year. The events of that war are yet recent in your memories—greater armies were led into the field; more important battles were fought; more difficult ſieges were underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; more dreadful defeats were experienced, and, in ſhort, more glorious victories &amp; conqueſts were obtained, than ever were known in this part of the world; America was more eminently the ſeat of war; our public affairs received an importance they never had before; not only England and France, but all Europe liſtened to our fate.</p>
            <p>Two things are obſervable, in which the laſt war differed from all that New-England had been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in before.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, that whereas the former Indian wars were principally confined to New-England, <hi>our</hi> frontiers were the only field of battle, and the other provinces, in a manner, ſat ſtill, in profound tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility, while we were ſtruggling hard to defend and keep poſſeſſion of our country; they put not their hand to the war; in the laſt war, the intereſts
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:011130_0041_0F854E70506E3128"/>
of the ſeveral governments became blended or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected together; they were obliged to join their forces, and the cauſe became a common one, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it muſt be acknowledged that New-England, even then, bore the burden and heat of the day.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. Whereas, in all preceeding wars, our eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern and weſtern frontiers were open to the ravages of the ſavages, during the laſt war, as we acted on the offenſive, and carried the war into the enemy's country, they were obliged to collect all their forces for their own defence, by which means our frontier ſettlements were unmoleſted: And, through the whole war, were, in a manner, ſafe from fear; a quiet habitation—a happineſs they never enjoyed in any preceeding war with France.</p>
            <p>The beginning of the laſt war was unſucceſsful in America. General Braddock, at the head of two regiments, marching to remove the enemy's en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments on the Ohio, was attacked and ſlain, and a dreadful ſlaughter was made of the troops under his command. In the latter end of the year, an army of French and Indians under General Dieſkau, was defeated by the provincial troops, and the French inhabitants were, the ſame year, remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Nova-Scotia.</p>
            <p>The next year (1756) our troops made an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active campaign. Nothing of any great moment happened, only the loſs of the Engliſh garriſon at Oſwego, and with it all our communication with the great lakes, or inland ſeas; which laid all the frontiers of America open to the incurſions of the enemy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="unknown:011130_0042_0F854E70DF0880F8"/>Seventeen hundred fifty ſeven, was a year of fear and of doubtful expectation—God was pleaſed to humble us before our enemies; we ſaw every thing run counter to our wiſhes &amp; expectations—a large fleet and army deſigned for the ſiege of Louiſburg effected nothing. General Montcalm, at the head of an army, croſſed the lakes and demoliſhed fort William-Henry, with many circumſtances of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. The whole continent was alarmed at this ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of our enemies. We were ready to fear the worſt, that the enemy would improve their victory and brirg fire and ſword into the interior parts of the country. The ableſt men amongſt us thought it a diſmal day; the hearts of many melted for fear: People of the beſt diſcernment looked on our condition as very diſtreſſed—to ſay the leaſt of it, it was "a day of darkneſs." We remember the wormwood and the gall, our ſoul
<q>hath them ſtill in remembrance.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The critical ſtate of the American war, and the hazzard the Colonies were in of being loſt, arouſed the fear of the nation, and obliged Great-Britain to ſend over a greater number of troops, with a powerful naval armament, to carry on the war in America.</p>
            <p>The events of the year 1758, were, in general, proſperous, though in ſome inſtances our enemies had the advantage. Louiſburg was inveſted and taken, and the naval power of France was thereby greatly reduced. But the repulſe of our army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Ticonderoga, with the loſs of not leſs than 2000 men, the flower of the Britiſh troops, killed, wounded and miſſing, was a humbling ſtroke.— This defeat was in ſome meaſure repaired, by the
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:011130_0043_0F854E71A269E7F0"/>
ſucceſsful expedition againſt Frontenac, the grand French magazine for ſupplying the enemy's garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to the weſtward, and the herds of ſavages, who, until then, were butchering the defenceleſs inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, on the frontiers of the weſtern and ſouthern Colonies. Soon after the enemy deſerted their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon on the Ohio, and the depredations of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians in a great meaſure ceaſed.</p>
            <p>In 1759, our affairs began with the greateſt probability of ſucceſs. The Britiſh and Provincial troops were commanded by able Generals, and the ſucceſs was equal to reaſonable expectation. Many of you remember how our hearts leaped for joy, on the arrival of the frequent meſſengers of our ſucceſſes. This year Niagara was beſieged and taken—Oſwego preſerved from a powerful attack of the enemy—a compleat victory was obtained over a large body of French and Indians, bending their way to raiſe the ſiege of Niagara—the lines and ſtrong fortreſs of Ticonderoga, were entered with little reſiſtance, and Crown-Point, the very key of the enemy's country, was abandoned. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the cloſe of the campaign, a deciſive and bloody battle was fought on the plains of Abraham, in which, the Generals of both armies were ſlain.<note n="(t)" place="bottom">Gen. Wolfe and Gen. Montcalm.</note> To this ſucceeded the ſurrender of the city of Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bec, after a long ſiege. Theſe ſucceſſes of the Britiſh troops broke the heart and power of the French, and determined the fate of Canada.</p>
            <p>The next year, 1760, is a glorious Aera for New-England, and all the American Colonies—an Aera our fathers longed to ſee. The enemy early made ſome feeble attempts to reſcue and ſave their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:011130_0044_0F854E72D812E720"/>
but all in vain.—God, who of old led his people through the Red-ſea, on dry ground, and dryed up the waters of Jordan, conducted our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies through the watry avenues of their country. He cauſed the fear and dread of them to fall upon our enemies; all hearts were faint, and all hands were feeble. Upon the approach of the Britiſh troops, the whole country of Canada was ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to the Crown of Great-Britain, and the entire conqueſt of the French in North-America was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated.—The extenſive countries, which the crown of France poſſeſſed, or claimed in North-America, which, in future ages, may contain many flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kingdoms, were, by the following treaty of peace, forever annexed to the Britiſh empire. Then the Lord delivered us from all our enemies—then "the Lord turned the captivity of Zion"—then
<q>was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with ſinging—then ſaid they among the heathen, the Lord hath done great things for them—the Lord hath done great things for us, whereof we are glad.</q>

            </p>
            <p>The laſt war was more intereſting and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant than any, that had taken place in America: It was a contending for the empire, not of New-England only, but of all North-America. <hi>Our Fathers,</hi> long ſince, predicted ſuch an important ſtruggle. The crown of France hurried it on, by a vigorous purſuit of the plan laid near an hundred years ago, to ſorround and ſubject to itſelf the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies of Great-Britain. Had the Britiſh &amp; French Colonies been left to contend with one another, it is highly probable the Engliſh, by reaſon of their
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:011130_0045_0F854E731D9885D8"/>
ſuperior numbers, had carried the day. But, as France was continually pouring troops into her Colonies, and erecting impregnable fortreſſes in the moſt advantageous places, <hi>we</hi> ſtood in abſolute need of powerful aids from the mother country. The loſs of her Colonies muſt have been of the moſt dreadful conſequence to Great-Britain, powerful ſuccours were therefore readily ſent over, not to ſuperſede, but to aid the utmoſt exertions of the Colonies. They did not take this occaſion to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw themſelves from the burden of war, but, to their utmoſt, yea, ſome of them, "beyond their ability," exerted themſelves, from the beginning to the end of the war. For ſeveral years, it is ſaid, a fifth part of the inhabitants of this province, fit to bear arms, were employed in the King's ſervice: And, if I miſtake not, <hi>this</hi> ſingle province had, one year, ten thouſand men employed in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice by ſea and land. Though I never could find that the number of the Coloniſts that periſhed in the laſt wars, was exactly aſcertained, yet ſeveral thouſands, from <hi>this</hi> country, muſt have periſhed, in ſo many years ſervice; in ſo many long marches, laborious and difficult ſieges, and ſharp encounters; and the debt contracted in the courſe of the war, notwithſtanding parliamentary grants, is <hi>ſtill</hi> a heavy burden upon the people of this province.</p>
            <p>Since the Britiſh empire became unrivaled, in North-America, New-England hath been a quiet habitation. Our moſt expoſed villages, that have been for ages expoſed to the barbarities of merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſavages, are now rejoycing in peace &amp; ſafety— every one ſits under his own vine and his own fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, and there are none to make us afraid. Our
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:011130_0046_0F854E74059031C0"/>
ſettlements are annually extending themſelves into the wilderneſs. Our numbers by the natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the inhabitants, and by acceſſions from foreign countries, are multiplying with great rapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity. New towns are filling up and churches erecting:
<q>The wilderneſs doth bloſſom as the roſe—the ſolitary place doth ſing for joy.</q>
            </p>
            <p>We are not to expect perfect felicity in the moſt proſperous times.—Government, in its moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect form, is liable to miſtakes; corruption creeps into the beſt ſyſtems. The repoſe of theſe Colonies, a few years ſince, was diſturbed by an attempt of the mother country to lay upon them unconſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional taxes and burdens. The <hi>Stamp-Act,</hi> which, had it operated in America, would have greatly ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected our liberty and property, was ſoon declared to be quite unconſtitutional, in the face of that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, who, but one year before, had paſſed the act, <note n="(w)" place="bottom">Particularly by theſe great men, Earl Chatham and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

               </note> and was preſently repealed. This was a ſtrange turn in favour of American liberty, and ſhows us how eaſy it is with the moſt high to turn the hearts of the children of men.—</p>
            <p>Unhappily, I may ſay, unhappily for Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and the Colonies too, we ſee another parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary act put in execution, for the deſign of raiſing a <hi>revenue,</hi> and of fixing the juriſdiction of Parliament, in ſuch a manner as to leave the Colonies without the power of diſpoſing of their own property. This act is generally reckoned quite unconſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal, and, in many reſpects very unfriendly to our liberties.—It cannot be concealed, that great unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs generally, almoſt univerſally, ſubſiſts in the
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:011130_0047_0F854E74ABBEF598"/>
Colonies, and there needs no great penetration to foreſee, that the continued enforement of this act will have very diſagreeable conſequences; not only with regard to our liberty and property, but as it tends to beget jealouſies, ſuſpicions, diſtruſt and alienation of affection, between the mother ſtate and her children.—<hi>We</hi> bear true and faithful alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to our ſovereign lord the King; we honor the dignity of Parliament; we wiſh for nothing more than a perpetual union with, and conſtitutional de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence on the mother country. We wiſh for no enlargement of our conſtitutional priviledges, only, that we may quietly enjoy thoſe, which have always been recognized by the high court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment itſelf. We are grieved to feel ſo ſevere marks of the royal diſpleaſure, and, on the ſlightieſt and moſt trifling pretences, to be repreſented and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally treated as ſubjects meditating ſedition and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion. But the moſt high ruleth in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of men. He that hath delivered can deliver yet again.—God has, at ſundry times, and in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers manners, appeared for this people, in ſeaſons of the greateſt public calamity. Liberty was the noble errand of our fathers over the Atlantic; the moſt high has hitherto gloriouſly owned the cauſe, and, I doubt not, he will ſtill continue to ſupport and preſerve it. We truſt in the righteouſneſs of our cauſe, and the uprightneſs of our intentions, that time will rectifie all miſtakes; the extent of our liberties, and the perfection of our obedience, will be better underſtood, and the grounds of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietude be removed.—In the mean time, let us, while we are ſeeking redreſs in every loyal and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional way, continue our fervent prayers, that the Throne may be eſtabliſhed in righteouſneſs;

that we may ſee the "good of his choſen," that we

Perhaps, by the ſuppreſſion of extravagance, and the improvement of trades and manufactures; by the practice of frugality and induſtry, what was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to bring us to a more abſolute dependence, may turn out, in its conſequences, to be a bleſſing.</p>
            <p>I have now led you through the moſt material and intereſting changes and events, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of our country, to this day.

            <p>For ſcores of years, with very little inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, we have been engaged in diſtreſſing wars with the ſavages, and thoſe who ſtimulated them up

againſt us. The expence has been diſtreſſing, and kept us poor. The growth of our ſettlements has been dreadfully impeded —probably there would have been hundreds of thouſands of inhabitants, in the New-England Colonies, more than there are at this day, could the country have been ſettled in peace. And it is impoſſible not to obſerve, that <hi>we</hi> have been commonly left alone to contend with our enemies. We have not, in our moſt diſtreſſed circumſtances, received protection or relief from Great-Britain, except, indeed, now and then ſome ſhips of war to guard the ſea-coaſts. <note n="(y)" place="bottom">I would be underſtood to ſpeak of the defence of our country; and the hard ſtruggle we have had to withſtand the natives, encouraged and aſſiſted by the French.</note> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we have, from the beginning, guarded our frontiers, and often engaged in heavy and expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive expeditions, to enlarge the kingdom, yet we were always left to ſupport the burden of debt thereby laid upon us. I am not able to learn that this province have ever received any aid, in money, from the mother country, before the reimburſement of the charges of taking Cape-Breton, in 1745. Since that time we have, I confeſs, received par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary aids, yet they have been in conſideration of a debt incurred beyond our proportion in the nation. Inſtead of royal donations, and parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary aſſiſtances, the truth of the matter is, that, for 120 years, we were not only deſtitute of them, but in that time have met with many diſcouragements from home to break the ſpirit of a diſtreſſed infant Colony. Our fathers had often hard meaſure.</p>
            <p>This country was at firſt ſought and ſettled as an Aſſylum for liberty, civil and religious: And
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:011130_0050_0F854E76EAE8F470"/>
it is worthy of obſervation, that the abettors of arbitrary power, and eccleſiaſtical tyranny, have, all along, been the enemies of New-England.— Charles I. under the influence of Arch-biſhop Laud, (who always kept a jealous eye over New-England, and had his emiſaries here, to make repreſentations of every thing that might ſet the Colonies in a bad light) endeavoured to cramp their growth, and threatned the aſſumption of their priviledges. His ſon, Charles II. liſtened to every one diſaffected to our proſperity, and begun the proſecution againſt the Charter. James II. unjuſtly aſſumed our rights and erected an arbitrary unconſtitutional govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. On the other ſide, if New-England has had the good will of the Court, it has been in the reigns of the Princes, whoſe names will be handed down to poſterity, as the protectors and reſtorers of the Engliſh liberties, as William III. and the Sovereigns of the reigning houſe of Hanover; which houſe we ſincerely pray God to continue on the throne for ever. —And this is what we may always expect, that a government ſo popular and friendly to liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as this will always be the envy and hatred of the abettors of tyranny, in Great-Britain, as well as among ourſelves. Again,</p>
            <p>I cannot but look back and adore the dealings of Heaven, all whoſe ways are judgment, and his paths paſt finding our, in gradually cutting off the babarous nations, to make room for us. The ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of the Canaanites was full, and for their ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry and wickedneſs, God cauſed the land to ſpue out its inhabitants; but what theſe barbarians had done, to provoke the divine diſpleaſure, we cannot tell. God's ways are unſearchable. But this we
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:011130_0051_0F854E77A8F390F8"/>
have ſeen, though the natives were very numerous before, and at the coming of our anceſtors, yet they have been ever ſince, to this day, diminiſhing until the whole race is in a manner extinct.—God did not cut them off at once; he left them, as he did the Canaanites of old, to try his people, to be thorns in their ſides, and pricks in their eyes; but yet their deſtruction has proceeded with gradual, ſure and uninterrupted ſteps. Every war they waged bro't ruin, in the end, upon themſelves. Every year leſſened their numbers; and even peace with us, and free intercourſe with our ſettlements: Yea, all our attempts to civilize and bring them to a regular life, have proved pernicious to them, in the end, and accelerated their deſtruction. And it is ſaid that all the numerous nations of Indians on the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, at leaſt all that have any intercourſe with us, are actually on the decreaſe. I am ready to think that, not only the extenſion of our ſettlements, but all our attempts to civilize theſe barbarians, will be found hereafter, as they always have been, to haſten their utter deſtruction.—
<q>This is the Lord's doings, and it is marvellous in our eyes.</q>
We can ſcarce refrain a compaſſionate tear over an unhappy people, meeted out to be trodden down and brought to utter deſtruction. But it is time to proceed to our ſecond general head of Diſcourſe, which was to conſider,</p>

Where do we find the evidences of genuine ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and piety, in thoſe that pay no ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious regard to the Lord's-day! It is a ſaying, founded on obſervation, that religion proſpers or declines among a people, according to the reſpect that is ſhown to the Lord's-day; and even our reaſon ſhows us what a mighty influence the ſerious obſervation of the Lord's day, with a careful, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent attendance on the word, ſacraments and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, muſt have on the whole tempers and lives of chriſtians. So far as the Lord's-day becomes a ſeaſon for viſiting, feaſting, gaming and diverſions, the life of chriſtianity will expire, and all manner of vices grow among a people. Only caſt your eyes on thoſe places, where little regard is paid to the Lord's-day, and you will find them, in a ſtate of ignorance, and immorality, little or nothing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than abſolute heatheniſm. The puritans in
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:011130_0053_0F854E792657A0C8"/>
England, ſo long ago as the reigns of James I. and Charles I. diſtinguiſhed themſelves, by their ſerious obſervation of holy time, and their oppoſition to ſports and games on the Lord's-day. Several e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent miniſters were, if I miſtake not, turned out of their livings for refuſing to read, in the churches, a proclamation for ſports on the Lord's-day. Our fathers were in general very ſtrict and preciſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers of the Lord's-day They permitted no ſports or diverſions, and, when they were not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in public worſhip, they applied themſelves to offices of piety, ſuch as reading, praying, cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſing, and ſinging in their own houſes. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, I hope, of this excellent ſpirit ſtill remains, in this land. We have yet good laws enacted to prevent the prophanation of holy time: And, I hope, there are not wanting ſome, who have zeal and courage enough to put them into execution. But it is not to be doubted that, through the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, in general, a ſerious regard to the Lord's-day is on the decline. Under a notion of laying aſide the preciſeneſs, or, as ſome call it, the ſcupo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſity of our anceſtors, I fear, we are falling into the quite contrary extream. Not only worldly diſcourſes, but even viſiting, and riding from town to town, and walking for diverſion, are becoming common among us. But let me call upon you, my dear friends and neighbours, to awaken your zeal for the preciſe obſervation of the Lord's-day. Not only let us ſtatedly frequent the public wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Chriſt, but let us carry our regards for holy time into private. Inſtead of worldly diſcourſes, needleſs viſiting, or diverſions of any kind, let us improve this day at home, in prayers and devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Let us keep our families in due ſubjection,
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:011130_0054_0F854E79DC1218A0"/>
reſtrain them from all levity and diverſion, and bring them up in a ſerious and reverend regard for holy time. Let us permit no idle company in our houſes, and ſteadily diſcourage and frown on every thing that tends to abate the reverence and reſpect people ought to have for the ſabbath. We cannot but be grieved for that prophanation of holy time, which comes under our obſervation: If we have increaſing examples of this, let them not abate our ſerious regard to our duty. Otherwiſe we ſhall offend God, bring on a ſad decay of real religion, and ruin our poſterity.—While I recommend the obſervation of the Lord's-day, I plead for that reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which is our life, and by which we ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long our days in the land which the Lord our God has given us.</p>
            <p>Another thing, which the preſent moral ſtate of the country leads me to recommend to ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, is an attendance on the Lord's ſupper. The Lord's ſupper, as it is an expreſs and plain, ſo it is an important and uſeful inſtitution of the redeemer. I am grieved to find there is ſuch a general neglect of it in this land. Many churches are awfully reduced in their numbers, and, in ſome places, the neglect is become faſhionable and almoſt univerſal. Such great numbers abſent themſelves from the Communion that it is become in a manner reputable to live and die in this ſad and dangerous neglect. The common diſregard to this inſtitution of Chriſt is, I am verily perſuaded, one of the cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſins of this people, and an aſtoniſhing inſtance of the want of love to Chriſt, the life and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of chriſtianity.—It is an evidence how little perſons are concerned to be ſaved. It is probable
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:011130_0055_0F854E7AAEF83738"/>
ſome real chriſtians may abſent themſelves from the communion, through real fears &amp; ſcruples. Many things have been injudiciouſly ſaid in paſt ages, which may cauſe an unreaſonable dread and fear of coming to the Lord's table. Prejudices are not eaſily eradiated from mens minds. But, I confeſs, I have not that extenſive charity as to ſuppoſe but that, by far, the greater part of thoſe, that live in the neglect of the Lord's ſupper, do ſo from a low eſteem for this ordinance of Chriſt, or becauſe they are afraid, that by ſo ſolemn a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of chriſtianity, they ſhall bring themſelves under the neceſſity of a more circumſpect life, or diſhonour themſelves by contradicting, in practice, their own profeſſion. After all that can juſtly be ſaid in excuſe for this general omiſſion, it argues at leaſt, a prevailing infidelity of heart, a coldneſs in religion, an awful want of regard to Chriſt, and a dreadful unconcernedneſs as to the mercy of God in another world. Our fathers, perhaps to avoid the other extream, made the terms of chriſtian communion too ſtrait and narrow, which might be offenſive and diſcouraging to ſome; but, in moſt of our churches, there is a more liberal ſpirit, and nothing is required, as a term of communion, that any ſerious well-diſpoſed perſon ſhould ſcruple to comply with. Oh that baptized perſons; that profeſſed chriſtians would think of this great duty! Oh! that all, who love the Lord Jeſus, would, in their ſeveral places, do all they can to wipe away the reproach that is caſt on the precious redeemer of ſouls, and the inſtitution, by which his diſciples are to be peculiarly diſtinguiſhed from all mankind. Let thoſe who love Chriſt be earneſt in prayer, that God would pour out his Spirit; then ſhall we ſee
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:011130_0056_0F854E7B6699F928"/>
men and women flying, as the clouds, and as the doves to their windows, to this precious ordinance of the redeemer.</p>
            <p>Suffer me alſo to tell you, that the great increaſe of profane curſing and ſwearing in the land does greatly provoke God, and cauſe the hearts of good men to mourn. This country was once remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for its regard to the name of God. Curſing and ſwearing were once rare, and accounted very diſhonourable; and, when known, ſeverely pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed by civil authority. I have heard of a man that lived ſome time in New-England, who upon his return to Old-England, declared, he had lived <hi>ſeven</hi> years in a country, and all that time had never ſeen any one drunk, nor heard a profane oath. But, alas! the times are ſadly changed, and that, as far as I can obſerve, not only in populous places, but in country villages, and through the country in general. This has been a growing vice for many years: But the late wars, wherein ſuch great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of our young men were employed in the army, have dreadfully corrupted our morals, and ſpread ſuch profaneſs as was never known in the country before. And our preſent diſagreable circumſtances are, I fear, every day increaſing profaneſs in the midſt of us. What multitudes are found who fear not to curſe and ſwear, and take the awful name of God into their mouths, on every occaſion, in their common converſation? It is impoſſible to walk the ſtreets, in populous places, and not be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to hear horrid oaths &amp; imprecations. How many children, almoſt as ſoon as they can ſpeak, learn to ſwear? Good men, I fear, look with too little diſpleaſure on this ſin. Children are not
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:011130_0057_0F854E7C393343C8"/>
watched and warned againſt and puniſhed for this ſin, as they ought to be. How ſeldom are the good laws againſt curſing &amp; ſwearing, put in execution? In ſhort, it is, with many, no blot in a man's cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, to curſe and ſwear: Men that are profane, (I might ſay obſcene too) notwithſtanding paſs, with many, for very good kind of men. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of profaneſs, calls for humiliation: It calls for the united endeavours of miniſters and magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, and all who regard the intereſt of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which is the life of any people. This matter particularly calls for your ſerious attention, who live in a place of ſo much concourſe and buſineſs. You cannot be too watchful over your children, nor too careful to keep them out of the way of temptation.</p>
            <p>The ſpread of intemperance, and the exceſſive uſe of ſpirituous liquors, theſe late years, calls for the ſerious conſideration of all that regard the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and welfare of their country. The firſt inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of this country, were remarkable for their temperance; but alas, how is the gold become dim, and the moſt fine gold changed? Little uſe was, for a long time, made of ſpirituous liquors, unleſs for a medicine—for common refreſhment they were ſeldom or never taken. But our trade with the Weſt-india Iſlands, has abundantly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed us with the means of intemperance. The great plenty of ſpirituous liquors hath proved a temptation too hard for many to withſtand, and truly threatens the deſtruction of thouſands of our inhabitants. That which once only ſerved for pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar occaſions, is now become the common drink of a great part of our labouring people. Many
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:011130_0058_0F854E7CDF8974B0"/>
have ſo habituated themſelves to ſtrong drink, that they will perform no ſervice without the liberal uſe of it. Only conſider, my Brethren, how many, by the exceſſive uſe of ſtrong drink, become ſtupid, idle, poor huſbands; ſquander away their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; waſting what they earn, or laying out ſo great a part that they are poor and miſerable. How many poor people lay out almoſt all they earn for Rum, and therefore when any diſaſter befals them, they become a charge and burden to their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and the community. Many ſpend their eſtates, and bring their families to poverty. How many young men, who, in early life, bid fair to be uſeful members of ſociety, are debauched and ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by exceſſive drinking! How many break and enfeeble their conſtitutions, and die before their time, by this accurſed vice! Truly, my hearers, I am warm when I ſpeak of theſe things, and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be otherwiſe. I tremble to think what miſchiefs this ſingle vice is bringing on this, that otherwiſe might be, the happieſt people in the world. There is ſcarce any thing I can hear of a friend, neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, or acquaintance, ſo ſhocking to me, as that he indulges the common and liberal uſe of ſtrong drink. When once the appetite gets the rule; when once ſpirituous liquors become neceſſary, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to the carrying on buſineſs, I almoſt ſet that down as a gone, a ruined man: It defeats every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable hope. Oh my friends, my dear country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, this growing, this peſtilential evil, calls for ſome ſpeedy and effectual remedy. It calls for the united oppoſition of magiſtrates, miniſters, ſober houſholders; and of all that wiſh well to the proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their country. Let us ariſe, and, in our ſeveral places, make an effectual ſtand, or we are a poor
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:011130_0059_0F854E7DA5B45800"/>
miſerable enſlaved people. Don't you ſee the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive effects of this exceſs? Oh baniſh it from your families.—Let me earneſtly enjoyn it on the riſing generation, who have kept themſelves free from the power of vicious appetites, never to be brought into bondage. As for ſuch as have uſed themſelves to ſtrong drink, at their labour eſpecially, and plead up for it, one had near as good reaſon with the wind, or bid the ſun not ſhine, as pretend to turn them from what they dearly love. But as for you that are yet free from this folly, there is hope you will take warning. Don't you ſee the pernicious conſequences of this vice; it is at your peril; your amazing peril, at the peril of your health, character, proſperity; yea at the peril of your everlaſting ſalvation, that you make the common and daily uſe of ſtrong li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, in any way, neceſſary unto you.</p>
            <p>I have often and earneſtly recommended induſtry and frugality, as virtues abſolutely neceſſary to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic happineſs: And I would again recommend to your ſerious conſideration, what I have ſaid upon that intereſting ſubject. It is the happineſs of New-England that property is more equally divided than in any other part of the world; and, I believe, the poor have advantages for acquiring a comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſubſiſtence, and, even, for laying up eſtates, beyond almoſt any country whatſoever. But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out induſtry and frugality, no people in the world can flouriſh. If families live in idleneſs, if people go beyond their abilities in living, building, dreſs, equipage, and the like; if children are not care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully brought up to induſtry, there is no doubt they will be miſerable, with the greateſt and beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages.
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:011130_0060_0F854E7E6C975050"/>
It is therefore highly neceſſary, if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered only as the means of preſent public hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, that children be trained up to uſeful buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that we retrench ſuperfluities, that we content our ſelves with the effects of our own induſtry.— Theſe things I urge, not merely or chiefly as being at this time peculiarly neceſſary for anſwering po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical purpoſes in Great-Britain, but as now and always neceſſary to the life and proſperity of a people. Once more,</p>
            <p>Family government was very ſtrict, in the firſt ages of the country. But, if our fathers, in any inſtances, carried the matter too far <hi>then,</hi> we are certainly gone very far into the other extream <hi>now.</hi> Family government, through the country, is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally too much relaxed. The reverence and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of children to their parents, is too much leſſened. Too little reſtraint is laid on youth, which, left to it ſelf, is vanity. Family prayer is in many places moſt awfully neglected: The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence is, as might be expected, youth are looſe, profane, untractable and unadviſed. This want of family government is ſeen in ſchools and colleges, and is juſtly lamented by perſons of the beſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and obſervation. Families are the nurſeries of virtue and happineſs, and the laying aſide family religion, is ſtriking a blow at the root. It is high time for us to think of this matter. Let us all, this day, take up Joſhua's excellent reſolution;— "but as for me and my houſe we will ſerve the Lord." <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Joſhua 4.15.</note> Let us make our houſes Bethels for prayer—let us keep up the authority of parents and maſters—let us lay our reſtraints on youth, when
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:011130_0061_0F854E7F1BEDC3D8"/>
they would make themſelves vile, for a child, left to himſelf, bringeth his father to ſhame. Oh! if we love our families, if we tender their preſent happineſs or eternal life: If we regard poſterity, let us attend to the important work of family re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and government. This is a matter that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires wiſdom and prudence; by too much ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and ſtrictneſs, I know, it is poſſible children may be diſcouraged, but, generally ſpeaking, there is greater, far greater danger, that they will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured and ruined by too much indulgance.</p>
            <p>I might go on to mention other things implied in walking before God, and cloſely connected with the public weal. It is a maxim founded on the experience of all ages,
<q>righteouſneſs exalteth a nation, but ſin is a reproach to any people.</q>
               <note n="(b)" place="bottom">Prov. 14.24.</note> But the time calls upon me to finiſh my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.—</p>
            <p>Innumerable motives and arguments I could al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſet before you, to perſwade you to walk before the God of your fathers, taken from the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of domeſtic and public happineſs; from this world, and the world to come.—This is our life— but here I am ſtraitned by the want of time—only let me ſuggeſt a few thoughts.</p>
            <p>The conſideration of the noble deſign of plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this country, and of the excellent characters of its firſt inhabitants ſhould animate us to walk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and maintain a religious character. The views on which this land was ſettled were ſingular and noble: It was not trade and commerce, nor
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:011130_0062_0F854E7FDD33E808"/>
any worldly views, but religion was the noble motive that brought our fathers hither, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled them to the perils of their wilderneſs ſtate. They planted themſelves <hi>here</hi> with the real ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs views of ſerving God, and of training up their poſterity in the good ways of the Lord. They were indeed, in general a very ſerious oonſciencious ſet of people. In ſome things they appear to us, at this day, to have been narrow in their principles, but, if we reflect, we ſhall find nothing ſingular in them on that account. The age they lived in was dark, compared with ours. The church had but lately emerged from popiſh darkneſs, and all ſects of chriſtians retained ſomething of the old leaven, the perſecuting ſpirit of popery; and it is no wonder our fathers had a tincture of it. Time and enquiry, experience and obſervation for more than an hundred years have increaſed the light, and taught the more ſenſible part of chriſtians moderation, candor and forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. With all their miſtakes, our anceſtors retain the character of ſingular exemplary chriſtians; and, would to God, we had more of their excellent ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Let us conſider from whence we are fallen and repent, that though we have ſuperior light we have loſt much of that ſerious devout heavenly ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which ſo happily diſtinguiſhed them. Let us ſtrive to recover and retain primitive piety. Let us keep in view the gracious end which they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued. May we never wholly loſe that religious character for which this land has ſo long been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable. May we guard againſt every tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to depart from the good way, our fathers walked in. Let us cleave to God and one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in love, that we may be unto him for a name
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:011130_0063_0F854E80A96EF6D0"/>
and for a praiſe and for a glory, above any other people on the earth.</p>
            <p>Should not love to God and gratitude to him, that has done ſuch marvellous things for us, engage us to ſerve him in holineſs and righteouſneſs? How can we trace the paths of providence, from age to age working for us, and not feel the goodneſs of God leading us to repentance! Can we ill requite the Lord—can we be evil and unthankful?</p>
            <p>Let us conſider our dependance on God for future proſperity. We have had an awful example of God's ſeverity in rooting out whole nations to make room for us. He cauſed them to melt away as the dew before the riſing ſun: Their name and memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial is, in a manner, periſhed out of the earth. Hath not God the ſame power over us? If we forſake him and ſerve other gods, or ſerve divers luſts and pleaſures, divine providence will caſt us out of its protection, we ſhall ſink under the weight of our own ſins, as multitudes of antient kingdoms and nations have done; we ſhall periſh from off the earth, and from under theſe heavens. God has judgments enough in ſtore—Fear as-well as love ought to engage us to ſerve God. Corruption and immorality are the natural, neceſſary ruin of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and hiſtory preſents us with ſtriking examples of nations that have ſunk under the weight of their own vices.—A people can never be free and happy but in proportion as they are virtuous—vice is ſlavery, miſery and certain ruin.</p>
            <p>Finally: Let us all ſeriouſly lay to heart our probationary ſtate, and the amazing eternity into which we are going. The retroſpect upon former
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:011130_0064_0F854E815DD5E0E0"/>
ages, gives us a ſtriking, an affecting idea of the changing ſtate of man. "One generation paſſeth away, and another cometh." "Our fathers" that laid the foundation of our preſent happineſs, whoſe names are had in reſpected remembrance, "where are they"? They have finiſhed their weariſome pilgrimage, made their bed in the duſt, and their ſepulchres are with us to this day. As all our fathers, we are but ſtrangers and ſojourners in this land. <hi>This</hi> century will houſe, by far, the greateſt part of this aſſembly in the duſt.—May divine grace enable us to act our part well on the ſtage of life, and, when we are taken out of this wilderneſs to Canaan above, may we leave this fair inheritance to our children, and they to theirs.
<q>As for man, his days are as graſs, as a flower of the field, ſo it flouriſheth, for the wind paſſeth over it and it is gone, and the place thereof ſhall know it no more. But the mercy of the Lord is from everlaſting to everlaſting upon them that fear him, and his righteouſneſs to childrens children; to ſuch as keep his covenant, and that remember his commandments to do them.</q>
