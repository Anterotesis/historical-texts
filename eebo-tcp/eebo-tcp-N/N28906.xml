            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE face of man is upward, and his eyes behold the heavens. By this, man is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, and highly privileged above all the lower creation: for <hi>truly the light is ſweet, and a pleaſant thing it is for the eyes to behold the ſun.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Contemplating the firmament of light—the <hi>ſtars</hi> which the Lord ordained; how high! how large! how numerous! how bright!—we gaze with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration: a flood of glory pours upon our minds; and our hearts are kindled with a pathos as of burning coals. Yet the <hi>moon,</hi> when ſhe ariſeth, ruleth the night: as queen of heaven, ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:038540_0005_1012529838CA8B30"/>
the attention of every eye: all the ſkies, ſilently, put on her ſilver robes; and wide o'er the earth extendeth her reign of light!—But <hi>the ſun alſo ariſeth!</hi> and where are now the ſtars? and where their beauteous queen? In the haſte of wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling obedience they have all retired, opening for him the wide path of heaven its whole length; which, at once, is filled with his golden beams.</p>
            <p>Here is wiſdom! When we underſtand that <hi>the heavens were made in wiſdom,</hi> we perceive that the natural heavens are the exact type and pattern of all worlds: and we are led to contemplate, with wonder and pleaſure, the analogy of all God's works.</p>
            <p>This is a meditation the moſt profitable and ſublime: and we are warranted by the ſcriptures to enter the ſacred field, and make uſe of theſe firſt works of God, to aſſiſt our thoughts and reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon thoſe wrought through every age, down to the preſent moment. In the ſcriptures, very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, the juſt are compared to the ſtars, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, to the moon, and the eminently good, to the clear ſhining of the ſun.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:038540_0006_1012529AA69DAA78"/>But the world on which we are now called ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly to meditate is ſocial America: in this he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſphere many great lights have ariſen: ſtars of magnitude have here beamed, and held a reſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent courſe; and often hath America, in her ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial walks, beheld the moon rounding her full <hi>orb,</hi> bright and unclouded.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>ſun</hi> alſo hath ariſen: one character hath here been exhibited, as diſtinguiſhed and unrival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, as the ſun in the firmament; and which the ſtupendous taſk hath devolved upon me, this day, to eulogize.</p>
            <p>But where ſhall I begin! The ſtars cluſter, we compare one with another; they are formed into conſtellations, and have their order: but there is, there <hi>can be,</hi> but one ſun; with him there is none to compare: nor doth the ſun preſent particular diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed points, which might direct a deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: it is one body of light.</p>
            <p>GEORGE WASHINGTON, the man or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by Heaven to rule our ſocial day, was every way qualified and marked out for his work. His perſon was moſt excellent—his countenance pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:038540_0007_1012529C4396CED8"/>
bright, and indeſcribably expreſſive of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt intellectual powers, diſpoſitions and acquire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. His limner needed not to depart from the truth for the ſake of the picture: the greateſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was the beſt picture. And the ſame obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be made of his hiſtorian: the beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and the moſt upright and impartial hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, will give the greateſt and beſt character of WASHINGTON.</p>
            <p>I had a great deſire to ſee the man of whom I had heard ſo much, to ſatisfy myſelf, if veneration and love had not given wings to the imagination, in the deſcription given of the dignity of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the ſymmetry and expreſſion of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; but when I ſaw him, one bright day, at the head of his army, marching againſt Cornwallis, I was ſatisfied: I found, that, as prompt as the imagination ever is in dreſſing, gracing, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting to advantage, the dear object of the heart, ſomething was here to be conceived of <hi>only</hi> by the eye.</p>
            <p>A man, kept from a view of the face of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, might form ideas of the beauty of ſome
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:038540_0008_1012529EAE7B94F8"/>
objects beyond what, in compariſon with others, belongeth to them; but he would never form too exalted ideas of the ſun: the livlieſt and moſt pleaſing imagination of the brightneſs of the ſun, is the ſight of the eye.</p>
            <p>This countenance, as we naturally expect, was the true index of the mind; <hi>a mind</hi> full of light and heat, which nothing can deſcribe, but the whole life of WASHINGTON.</p>
            <p>He was ſeriouſly reſerved, but of eaſy addreſs; moderate, yet reſolute; grave, yet ſprightly; mild, but heroic; prudent, but vigorous; liberal, <hi>liberal,</hi> with economy.</p>
            <p>His diſcernment was ſurpriſing; his judgment, no leſs wonderful: he penetrated, weighed and forecaſt every thing; and his application was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſant—<hi>All</hi> directed to the wiſeſt and nobleſt objects—ſocial happineſs—his country's freedom, independence, honour and proſperity—liberty, <hi>liberty</hi>—the rights and duties of man—and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever might exalt and felicitate the whole human race.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:038540_0009_101252A219000A28"/>Humane—he pitied his enemies, and rendered good for evil. Hoſpitable—his door was opened to the ſtranger, as to a friend: and impartial—to him all had free acceſs: no ſect or party, ſociety or diſtrict, formed his circle; but, like that of the ſun, it included all.</p>
            <p>Intereſting himſelf, deeply and <hi>conſcientiouſly,</hi> in the cauſe of virtue; he was forward to ſuſtain la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and faithful in every truſt—private and public—in ſocial life—at the head of armies—as a magiſtrate—in war, and in peace: perſevering in the purſuit of the benevolent object to the end.</p>
            <p>But what, perhaps, is moſt wonderful in this character, was that which is commonly called good fortune; but which we know to be the ſpecial agency of Divine Providence: for <hi>the race is not to the ſwift, nor the battle to the ſtrong.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>General WASHINGTON ſprang from one of the wealthieſt and moſt reſpected families in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica; and ſoon, in the events of Providence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came almoſt the ſole object of ſpecial attention and care. Being the favourite of the family, and of all acquaintances; in a part of the country diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:038540_0010_101252A4860A5F18"/>
for literary improvment, and popular edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; and poſſeſſing from a child the beſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and almoſt uninterrupted health; his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages were the beſt that could have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed.</p>
            <p>And no ſooner was he formed for any conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtation, than he was placed in the very ſphere where he might ſhine with every poſſible advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He</hi> never had to ſeek a ſphere of action: that Hand which ſtretched out the heavens, and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed where the ſun ſhould riſe, opened before WASHINGTON every door. Uſually, for men to aſcend to the loweſt ſpheres of light, <hi>hoc opus, hic labor eſt</hi>; but, for WASHINGTON, the eburne gate was lifted up, and it was neither <hi>labour</hi> nor <hi>pains</hi> to aſcend to the vertex.</p>
            <p>He was ever proſperous; whatever he engaged in ended well: and miraculous indeed were his preſervations—amidſt common dangers—and in battles, where the ſlain on the right hand and on the left were many—but moſt of all from the fell ſnares and toils of a wily, watchful and implacable
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:038540_0011_101252A62057FFB0"/>
foe; who knew all the depths of Satan, and could eaſily deſcend to the loweſt, even to countenance and encourage the dark aſſaſſin. But the ſoul of WASHINGTON was guarded by more than ſhield or ſword: it was bound up in the roll of life, and hidden beyond the ſearch of malice. He lived! he conquered! he ſaw his labours all finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—his deſires all accompliſhed! He ran the whole race, and reached the goal; neither faint nor wearied; but like the ſtrong man, that enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the evening with the vigour of the morning. Millions, in a proper ſenſe, gave him their hearts; Genius devoted his ſong; and Nature decreed her Vernon for his triumph.</p>
            <p>He was beloved, greatly beloved, moſt univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally beloved! by affinities, by domeſtics, ſoldiers, citizens, countrymen, and foreigners; by great and ſmall. He was the beloved child, the beloved youth, the beloved man, the beloved chriſtian, and the beloved ſage. The true and general af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection that he ſhared compareth with all the reſt, and ſtrikingly evinceth the agency of that Hand which holdeth all hearts: and worthy was he to be thus beloved.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:038540_0012_101252A896FD8B38"/>Our WASHINGTON lived at the moſt event<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and momentous period: he ſhined, a ſummer's ſun: he held his courſe, a harveſt day. His was a day of great men, and a day of great events; and all conſpired to make WASHINGTON <hi>great.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A HANCOCK, an ADAMS, a FRANKLIN, a JEFFERSON, a WARREN, a GREENE, a TRUM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BULL, a LIVINGSTON, a HENRY—a cloud of <hi>ſeventy-five men</hi> was prepared as a chariot for the advent of WASHINGTON.</p>
            <p>A George the Third, a Britiſh court, navy and army, had juſt ariſen to the zenith of empire, and the height of inſolence; ruling the ſeas, and, with a countenance the moſt terrific, menacing every ſhore, and claiming a right to bind free-born America, <hi>in all caſes whatſoever.</hi> Never was there a cauſe of reſiſtance more juſt; never, a clearer call to put on the harneſs; never, a cauſe more intereſting to the human race, that called for the ſword.</p>
            <p>This was thy day, O WASHINGTON! Thou waſt raiſed up for ſuch a time as this! All

this train of wonderful events united together to make our Golden Orb the centre of the ſocial ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>But, though we view a man, in ſociety, worthy of a compariſon with the ſun, in the natural world; yet we view neither the one nor the other as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect or divine. There are ſpots in the ſun; his beams are ſometimes ſcorching; and, though he eclipſeth all the heavens with his brightneſs, he in his turn ſuffers eclipſes.</p>
            <p>There were, doubtleſs, ſome imperfections in the character of WASHINGTON; but, like the ſpots in the ſun's diſk, they were loſt in his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences; they were comparatively ſmall.</p>
            <p>But, alas! ſome men have been ſo ſtupid and diſhonourable, as to give to the ſun divine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours—to pay to the creature the homage due to the Creator! Hath the worſhip of the heathen added any thing to the glory of the ſun? Far otherwiſe: inſtead of adding, in this way, they have detracted from his glory. The idolatrous worſhip, which hath been offered to the natural ſun, hath riſen up, like the fog of marſhy places,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:038540_0014_101229AF333D5EE0"/>
and obſcured his beams. Heathen lands are juſtly ſtyled dark and benighted lands: their idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries caſt a gloom over the face of the creation.</p>
            <p>And with what indignation ſhould we expreſs the conduct of ſome men, in favoured, <hi>enlightened</hi> America, whoſe fooliſh hearts, being equally dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened with thoſe of the heathen, have acted the ſame ſtupid and brutiſh part! who have attempted to obſcure the brightneſs of the wonderful charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of WASHINGTON, by the fumes of idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous praiſe! Were theſe WASHINGTON'S friends? Never! never! but the enemies of the revolution, ſeekers and time-ſervers. Never did this effulgent character ſhine ſo dimly, as when it hath been thus <hi>profanely</hi> eulogized.</p>
            <p>It is obſerved of the heathen, in their adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions paid to the ſun, that their ſervile minds led them to dwell much upon his rare and moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant aſpects: they have more to ſay of his eclipſes, than of all his bright and benignant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences—a ſtriking proof of their being influenced by the devil. And the ſame circumſtance may be obſerved of the adulators of WASHINGTON.
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:038540_0015_101252AFDC722A60"/>
Audacious men! they have dared to inſult his ever-faithful friends, when attempting to defend his true character againſt their impious flattery; and call them WASHINGTON's enemies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would not bow down, and give to the creature, the moſt exalted creature, the glory due to the Creator.</p>
            <p>But WASHINGTON deſired not this: it was to him moſt painful, as the tear of ſorrow often beſpoke. He realized he was a man; a mortal man; an accountable man. He confeſſed imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, which none but himſelf could ſee. And no man appeared to have a clearer and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant view of the divine agency over him, than himſelf. How earneſtly and repeatedly did he call on all his friends—on all America—to give the glory to God! How doth this aggravate the conduct of his blaſphemous adulators!</p>
            <p>O WASHINGTON! didſt thou ſay in thy Farewell Addreſs, "I ſhall carry with me the hope that my country will never ceaſe to view the errors I may have committed with indulgence; and that, after forty-five years of my life dedicated
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:038540_0016_101252B3581CD230"/>
to its ſervice, with an upright zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be conſigned to obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion?" Wiſt thou not that they were already co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered and conſigned to <hi>oblivion</hi> by the effulgence of thy beneficent life?</p>
            <p>But <hi>the ſun goeth down.</hi> How ſolemn the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment! how affecting the ſcene! America, cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with her tokens of mourning, turneth her eyes to the weſtern horizon, to behold an event often contemplated with an anxious heart—a ſetting ſun—a ſun going down, to ariſe no more.</p>
            <p>We have no reaſon to expect another WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON in America; for <hi>by wiſdom God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the heavens,</hi> and there is but one ſun in the wide expanſe: we may not look for another ſo diſtinguiſhed a character in our ſphere, while the preſent order of things continues.</p>
            <p>The ſtars alſo, his compatriots, have become occidental, and rapidly fall from heaven. This year hath been remarkable for the deceaſe of great men in America. Solemn thoughts preſs upon the mind! The ſocial ſyſtem hath received a great ſhock in the death of WASHINGTON;
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:038540_0017_101252B5C42F9C08"/>
and what can be ſhaken muſt ere long be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.</p>
            <p>How ominous is this event! When you conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this, and the general aſpect of all the great events now taking place through the world, with a recollection of my particular views of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine prophecies, you will not ſuppoſe the thought, in me, ariſeth from the enthuſiaſm of the moment, that they portend the cloſing ſcene—that the night is approaching, which will immediately pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede that <hi>other</hi> day, new in its nature, divine, and eternal. May we be prepared for that moſt ſolemn ſcene; and may this event be ſanctified to us, and to all the people, for that end.</p>
            <p>But we have conſolation in the midſt of our mourning; <hi>light ariſeth in the darkneſs.</hi> WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON died in the full confidence and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a free and happy people: and though our Golden Orb deſcendeth below the horizon of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural life, the ſkies ſtill reflect his rays. O WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON! thou ſtill liveſt in the grateful heart of republican America, and there thou wilt ever live.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:038540_0018_101252B82DD6A650"/>More! infinitely more! Behold a Divine Sun ariſeth! O ZION! thy Sun ſtill ſhineth in all his ſtrength; and <hi>thy Sun ſhall not go down!</hi> The LORD is thine everlaſting light, and thy God thy glory.</p>
            <p>What infinite obligations of gratitude and praiſe are we laid under to God, who according to WISDOM framed the heavens; who appointed the ſun and the moon to ſhine in their glorious ſpheres, and marſhalled the ſtars in their beautiful order; and who hath ſtretched out thoſe heavens before our eyes, as the <hi>pattern</hi> of all his wonderful works, in the ſocial and civil worlds, and of what, finally, will be exhibited in perfection in the world of glory!</p>
            <p>O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good, for his mercy endureth forever! to Him that by wiſdom made the heavens, for his mercy endureth forever! to Him that made <hi>great lights,</hi> for his mercy endureth forever! to Him that raiſed up WASHINGTON, preſerved him, and gave him victory, peace and proſperity, for his mercy endur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forever!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:038540_0019_101252B9CB38ECC0"/>And O give thanks unto Him who hath made the heaven of heavens, for his mercy endureth forever! who hath cauſed the <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs</hi> to ſhine there, for his mercy endureth forever! and who hath given his redeemed people the certain proſpect of ſeeing and enjoying that Sun, a long, eternal day, for his mercy endureth forever!</p>
