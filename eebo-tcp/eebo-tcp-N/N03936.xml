            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>BEING kindly invited by a Miniſter of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> after Dinner I went to <hi>Rye,</hi> about eleven Miles from <hi>Stanford.</hi> I react Prayers and preached to a ſmall Congregation.

                  <hi>Thurſday, October</hi> 30. Preached in the Morning to about 300 People, and obſerved a ſweet Melting among them. Dined and rode ſix Miles to <hi>King's Bridge,</hi> where I preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Steps of a publick Houſe to about 500; but did not perceive much viſible Effect. Hither ſeveral of <hi>New-York</hi> Friends came to meet me. I talk'd with them on the Way of the Things of God, and found an inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible Satisfaction in my Soul when I arrived at the Houſe of my very dear Friend Mr. <hi>Noble.</hi> After Supper, the Lord filled my Heart, and gave me to wreſtle with him for <hi>New-York</hi> Inhabitants, and my own dear Friends. To add to my Comfort, the Lord brought my Dear Brother <hi>Davenport</hi> from <hi>Long-Iſland,</hi> by whoſe Hands the bleſſed Jeſus has of late done <hi>great</hi> Things. In a Letter to his Mother he writes thus:
<q>The Lord has, in infinite Mercy, given me, in my Pariſh, near twenty, in a little more than two Months Time. In almoſt all theſe the Work of Converſion ſeem'd very clear.</q>
                  <hi>Let God have all the Praiſe. Even ſo, Lord Jeſus, Amen &amp; Amen.</hi>

                  <hi>Friday, October</hi> 31. Met with a bitter Pamphlet wrote againſt me by ſome of the Presbyterian Perſuaſion, and found Freedom given me to anſwer it. I long ſince ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected cloſe Oppoſition from that Quarter. I believe it will be increaſing daily. The Lord will make me more than Conqueror thro' his Love! Met alſo with two Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes of Sermons publiſhed in <hi>London</hi> as delivered by me, tho' I never preach'd on moſt of the Texts. But <hi>Satan</hi> muſt try all Ways to bring the Work of God into Contempt. Bleſſed be God, who enables me abundantly to rejoice in all Things that befal me. Preached in the Morning at Mr <hi>P—n's</hi> Meeting-Houſe: But never ſaw the Word of God fall with ſuch Weight in <hi>New-York</hi> before. Two
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:004853_0004_100E02662FBA3F18"/>
or three cried out. Mr. <hi>Noble</hi> could ſcarce refrain himſelf. And, look where I would, many ſeem'd deeply wounded. At Night the Word was attended with great Power. One cried out; and the Lord enabled me, at the latter End of my Sermon, to ſpeak with Authority. Alas! How vain are the Thoughts of Men! As I came along Yeſterday, I found my Heart ſomewhat dejected, and told Mr. <hi>Noble</hi> I expected but little Movings in <hi>New York</hi>; but Mr. <hi>Noble</hi> bid me
"expect great Things from God,"
and likewiſe told me of ſeveral who were, as he hoped, ſavingly wrought upon by my Miniſtry, when there laſt. <hi>O Lord, let theſe Things humble my Soul for thy own Name's Sake</hi>!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saturday, November</hi> 1. Finiſhed my Anſwer to the Pamphlet. God enabled me to write it in the Spirit of Meekneſs. <hi>O Lord give it thy Bleſſing</hi>! Preached twice as Yeſterday to very crowded Auditories, and neither Time without Power. In the Evening Exerciſe, ſome fainted, and the Lord ſeemed to ſhew us more and more, that a Time for favouring <hi>New-York</hi> was near at Hand. <hi>O wherefore did I doubt! Lord increaſe my Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sunday, November</hi> 2. Preached this Morning with Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and ſome Power, but was much dejected before the Evening Sermon. For near half an Hour before I left Mr. <hi>Noble</hi>'s Houſe, I could only lie before the Lord and ſay,
<q>I was a poor Sinner, and wonder that Chriſt would be gracious to ſuch a Wretch.</q>
As I went to Meeting, I grew weaker and weaker, and when I came into the Pulpit, I could have choſe to be ſilent rather than ſpeak. But, after I had begun, the Spirit of the Lord gave me Freedom, till at length it came down like a mighty ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wind, and carried all before it. Immediately the whole Congregation was alarmed. Shricking, Crying, Weeping and Wailing were to be heard in every Corner. Men's Hearts falling them for Fear and many falling into the Arms of their Friends. My Soul was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>

                  <pb n="6" facs="unknown:004853_0005_100E0267B5EA94F0"/>
overwhelmed me. As I went down, a Woman ſaid,
"Come and ſee wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> God has done for me To-night."
I looked, and her Daughter, in a great Agony, was cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out,
"Oh my Jeſus, my Jeſus!"
Another, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Boy, was ſo concerned on the Pulpit Stairs, that he could ſcarce ſtand. One of my Friends asked him why he cried,
<q>Who can help it? ſaid he. Mr. <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field's</hi> Words cut me to the Heart.</q>
After I came home, I threw myſelf upon the Bed, and in an awful Silence, admired the infinite Freeneſs, Sovereignty and Condeſcenſion of the Love of God. I was unwilling to move, but was called down to the Marriage of Mr. <hi>B—r,</hi> whom I met at <hi>Rhode Iſland,</hi> who being eſpouſed to the young Woman, who was ſo ſtruck at the ſame Place, by my Advice, married her this Night, and both are going as my Aſſiſtants to <hi>Georgia.</hi> Never did I ſee a more ſolemn Wedding. Jeſus Chriſt was called, and he was preſent in a remarkable Manner. After Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried them, I prayed. But my Soul, how was it enabled to wreſtle with and lay hold on God! I was in a very great Agony, and the Holy Ghoſt was remarkably pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that moſt, I believe, could ſay, <hi>Surely God is in this Place</hi>! After this, Divine Manifeſtations flowed in ſo faſt, that my frail Tabernacle was ſcarce able to ſuſtain them. My dear Friends ſat round me on the Bed-ſides. I pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for each of them alternately with ſtrong Cries, and pierced by the Eye of Faith, even within the Veil. I continued in this Condition for about half an Hour, aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed at my own Vileneſs, and the Excellency of Chriſt, then roſe full of Peace, and Love and Joy. Oh! how am I obliged to my Enemies; God has remarkably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed himſelf to my Soul, ever ſince I have ſeen the Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet publiſhed by the Presbyterians againſt me. O how faithful is he that promiſed, <hi>It ſhall bruiſe thy Heel, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his Head! Lord enable me to lay hold on this, during the Time of my ſojourning here on Earth.</hi>

There was a great and gracious Melting among the People both Times, but no crying out. Near 110<hi>l.</hi> Currency were collected for the Orphans; and in the Evening many came and took an affectionate Leave. About ſeven we took Boat; reached <hi>Staten Iſland</hi> about ten, greatly refreſhed in my inner Man. A dear Chriſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

And about Midnight retired to ſleep, ſtill longing for that Time when I ſhould ſleep no more. <hi>Lord keep me from a ſinful and too eager Deſire after Death. I deſire not to be impatient. I deſire quietly to wait till my bleſſed Change come. Amen and Amen.</hi>

                  <hi>Tueſday, Nov.</hi> 4. Preached from a Waggon on <hi>Staten Iſland,</hi> to about 3 or 400 People. The Lord came amongſt them. One dear young Man, in particular, as tho' his very Heart-ſtrings would break, came to me after Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, with ſtrong Cryings and Tears, beſeeching me,
<q>to pray that he might be converted.</q>
Many others wept alſo, and ſeveral of God's Children felt the Preſence of the dear Lord Jeſus in their Hearts. Many of them rejoiced to ſee me again. One grey headed Man came and told me how God had brought him from Darkneſs to Light, when I was here laſt. My Soul was alſo much refreſhed with the Sight of dear Mr. <hi>Gilbert Tennent</hi> and Mr. <hi>Croſs.</hi> The former has lately loſt his Wife, and tho' dear unto him, yet he was enabled with great Calmneſs to preach her funeral Sermon, whilſt the Corps were lying before him. This put me in Mind of <hi>Melancthon,</hi> who, at the News of his Wife's Death, ſaid,
<q>By <hi>Kate,</hi> I'll come after thee ere it be long</q>
Since his Wife's Deceaſe, Mr. <hi>Tennent</hi> has been in the <hi>Weſt Jerſeys</hi> and <hi>Maryland,</hi> and told me how God remarkably work'd by his Miniſtry
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004853_0007_100E026AE7BF7210"/>
in many Places. Mr. <hi>Croſs</hi> alſo has ſeen great and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Things in his Congregations, ſo great that when I came to deſire a particular Account, he ſaid,
<q>It directly anſwered the Account given by Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> of the Work of God in <hi>Northampton.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <hi>What is the Lord Jeſus about to do! If the Beginning is ſo great, what will the End of theſe Things be</hi>! Rode after Sermon to <hi>Newark,</hi> about ten Miles from <hi>Staten Iſland.</hi> Preached to a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Congregation, but it being dark before I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, I could not ſee what Impreſſions the Diſcourſe made. I fear but little. However, at Night the Lord manifeſted forth his Glory. For coming down to Family Prayer, where I lodged, and perceiving many young Men around me, my Soul was, as it were melted down with Concern for them. After ſinging, I gave a Word of Exhortation. With what Power none can fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs but thoſe that ſaw it. O how did the Word fall like a Hammer and like a Fire! What a Weeping was there! One poor Creature in particular was ready to ſink into the Earth. His Countenance was altered, till he look'd, as it were, ſick to Death. At length he ſaid,
"What ſhall I do to be ſaved?"
Others were diſſolved into Tears around him; and one of my Fellow-travellers was ſtruck down, and ſo overpowered, that his Body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come exceeding weak. He could ſcarce move all the Night after. God, I believe, was now working power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully on his Soul. As for my own Part, I was almoſt ſpent. I vomited, threw myſelf upon the Bed, humbled myſelf before God, and ſpent the Remaining Evening in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dear Mr. <hi>Tennent</hi> give an Account of his late Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſion. Oh he is a choice humble Miniſter of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel! <hi>May I follow him as he does Chriſt. Ame and Amen.</hi>

                  <hi>Wedneſday, Nov.</hi> 5. Set out about eight in the Morning. Got to <hi>Baskinridge,</hi> the Place where Mr. <hi>Croſs</hi> exerciſes
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004853_0008_100E026D6FF14CD8"/>
his ſtated Miniſtry, about one o'Clock. At the Houſe where I waited in the Way, a Woman ſpoke to me, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſtrong Convictions, and told me,
<q>ſhe was deeply wounded by my laſt Night's Diſcourſe</q>
When I came to <hi>Baskinridge,</hi> I found Mr. <hi>Davenport,</hi> according to Appointment, had been preaching to the Congregation. It conſiſted of about 3000 People. As I went along I told a Friend,
<q>My Soul wept for them, and I was perſwaded within my ſelf, that the Lord would in that Day make his Power to be known amongſt them.</q>
In Prayer, I perceived my Soul drawn out, and a ſtirring of Affection among the People. I had not diſcourſed long, but the Holy Ghoſt diſplayed his Power. In every Part of the Congregation, ſome Body or other began to cry out, and almoſt all melted into Tears. This abated for a few Moments, till a little Boy about ſeven or eight Years of Age cried out exceeding piteouſly indeed, and wept as tho' his little Heart would break. Mr. <hi>Croſs</hi> having Compaſſion on him, took him up into the Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, which ſo affected me that I broke from my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and told the People,
<q>the little Boy ſhould preach to them, and that God, ſince old Profeſſors would not cry after Chriſt, had diſplayed his Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and out of an Infant's Mouth was perfecting Praiſe.</q>
God ſo bleſſed <hi>this,</hi> that an univerſal Concern fell on the Congregation again. Freſh Perſons dropp'd down here and there, and the Cry encreaſed more and more. At length I concluded, and as I was going away, I asked the little Boy "what he cried for?" He anſwered, "his Sins" I then asked, "What he wanted?" He anſwer'd, "Chriſt" As I paſſed along, freſh Inſtances of God's Power preſented themſelves to my View. Many mourning after Jeſus that would not be comforted. After Sermon, Mr. <hi>Croſs</hi> gave Notice of an Evening Lecture in his Barn about two Miles off Thither we went, and a great Multitude followed. Mr. <hi>Gilbert Tennent</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed firſt, and that excellently well upon the Neceſſity
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004853_0009_100E0270399E7D00"/>
and Benefit of ſpiritual Deſertions. I then began to pray, and felt the Spirit of God working in me mightily. A great Commotion was ſoon obſerved among the Hearers, I then gave a Word of Exhortation. The Lord's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence attended it in a ſurprizing Manner. One in about ſix Minutes cried out,
"He is come, he is come,"
and could ſcarce ſuſtain the Diſcovery that Jeſus Chriſt made of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to his Soul. Others were ſo earneſt for a Diſcovery of the Lord to their Souls, that their eager Crying obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged me to ſtop, and I prayed over them as I ſaw their Agonies and Diſtreſs increase. At length we ſung a Hymn, and then retired to the Houſe where the Man that recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Chriſt continued till near Midnight, talking of and praiſing,
<hi>"his</hi> ſweet <hi>Chriſt, his</hi> free hearted <hi>Christ,"</hi>
&amp;c. A gracious Woman, who had been wreſtling with God for a Diſplay of his Power, was ſo overcome with a Senſe of his Goodneſs, that ſhe almoſt ſwoon'd away. And at length, my own Soul was ſo full that I retired, and was in a ſtrong Agony for ſome Time, and wept before the Lord, under a deep Senſe of my own Vileneſs, and the Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Greatneſs of God's everlaſting Love. Moſt of the People ſpent the Remainder of the Night in Prayer and Praiſes. Two or three young Miniſters ſpoke alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, and others prayed as the Lord gave them Utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance Oh! it was a Night much to be remember'd! <hi>May the Lord make us mindful of it even to the Day of our Death. Amen and Amen.</hi>

"whether ſhe knew Chriſt?"
She ſaid
"Yes" "How long?" "Three Years, ſaid ſhe, the third <hi>Sunday</hi> in next <hi>March.</hi>"
I asked another the ſame Queſtion. She anſwered
<q>Yes, but I am waiting for a freſh Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the bleſſed Spirit.</q>
I, with Pleaſure, took my Leave of them, and rode agreeably in Company with many Children of God, to <hi>New-Brunſwick,</hi> 23 Miles from <hi>Baskinridge.</hi> Here Letters awaited me from <hi>Savannah,</hi> acquainting me that there had been a great Mortality a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the People of that Place. That my Family lived in Love, the Orphans continued very healthy, and that a Miniſter was coming over to ſupply my Place at <hi>Savannah.</hi> This laſt much rejoiced me, being reſolved to give up <hi>Savannah</hi> Living as ſoon as I arrived at <hi>Georgia. A Pariſh and the Orphan-Houſe together are too much for me. Beſides God ſeems to ſhew me it is my Duty to evangelize, not to fix in any particular Place.</hi> In the Evening I preach'd in Mr. <hi>Gilbert Tennent</hi>'s Meeting-Houſe, and was led in my Diſcourſe to comfort the Hearts of God's dear People. A little after Mr. <hi>B—r</hi> (a young Miniſter, who I truſt, will hereafter come fairly out for God) preach'd for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout an Hour, and then, at the Deſire of dear Mr. <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Tennent,</hi> I concluded with a Word of Exhortation, The Lord was plaeſed to communicate himſelf to me free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. My Soul was filled with his bleſſed Preſence. The Word fell with Weight: And after Sermon in private Prayer with my dear Friends, oh how did my loving Saviour cauſe my Cop to overflow!

About 11 o'Clock we parted in Tears, but with a full Aſſurance that we ſhould ſee and hear of great Things before we ſaw each other again in the Fleſh I then went on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Trenton,</hi> in Company with Mr <hi>Davenport</hi> and ſome others.

Preached this Morning in the Meeting Houſe, not to a very large or much affected Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory — Was reſtrained in public Preaching, but felt an eſpecial Preſence of God in my private Buſineſs. Set out immediately after Dinner, and was mercifully and very providentially preſerved in going over two Creeks, which lay in the Way, and were much ſwell'd by the Rain. In one of them two of my Fellow-Travellers, in all Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, muſt have periſhed, had not a Woman cried out, and bid us ſtop. A Man touched, as I afterwards found, by my Miniſtry, hearing my Voice, came and ſwam our Horſes over the other Creek, and conducted us ſafe over a very narrow Bridge. About 8 we reached <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> tho' the Night was very dark indeed. Some Friends were juſt come in, who had been out another Way to meet me. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral with great Joy came to ſalute me. We ſang, we prayed. The Lord inclined his Ear. My Soul was fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, as it were with Marrow and Fatneſs.

It was never preach'd in before. The Roof is not yet up, but the People raiſed a convenient Pulpit, and boarded the Bottom. The Joy of moſt of the Hearers, when they ſaw me, was inexpreſſible: Some ſtill mocked. Between Services I received a Packet of Letters from <hi>England,</hi> dated in <hi>March</hi> laſt—<hi>May the Lord heal, and bring Good out of the Diviſions, which, at preſent, ſeem to be among the Brethren there</hi>! — God giving me Freedom, and many Friends being in the Room, I kneeled down and prayed with and exhorted them all.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h! My Soul was much rejoiced to look round on them, becauſe there were ſome who were now fairly brought through the Pangs of the New-Birth, who had been moſt marvellous Offenders againſt the great God. I ſhall mention two only. The firſt is one
<q>Mr. <hi>Brockden,</hi> Recorder of Deeds, &amp;c. a Man eminent in his Profeſſion, but for many Years a notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Deift. In his younger Day, he told me, he had ſome religious Impreſſions, but coming into Buſineſs, the Cares of the World ſo choaked the good Seed, that he not only forgat his God in ſome Degree, but at length began to doubt of, and to diſpute his very Being. In this State he continued many Years, and has been very zealous to propagate his Deiſtical, I could almoſt ſay Atheiſtical Principles among moral Men, but he told me he never endeavoured to make Proſelytes of vivious, debauched People. When I came to <hi>Philadelphia</hi> this Time Twelve month, he told me, he had not ſo much as a Curioſity to hear me But a Brother Deift, his choiceſt Friend, preſſing him to come and hear me, to ſatisfy his Curioſity, he at length complyed with his Requeſt. It was Night. I preach'd at the Court Houſe Stairs, upon the Conference which our Lord had with <hi>Nicodemus.</hi> — I had not ſpoke much before God ſtruck his Heart. For, ſaid he, I ſaw your Doctrine tended to make People good. His Family knew nothing that he had been to hear me. After he came Home his
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:004853_0014_100E027A173066C0"/>
Wiſe, who had been at Sermon, came in alſo, and wiſhed heartily that he had heard me. He ſaid nothing. After this, another of his Family came in repeating the ſame Wiſh; and, if I miſtake not, after that another, till at laſt being unable to refrain any longer, with Tears in his Eyes, Why, ſays he, I have been hearing him; and then expreſſed his Approbation. Ever ſince he has followed on to know the Lord, and I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Jeſus Chriſt has made himſelf manifeſt to his Soul. Tho' upwards of threeſcore Years old, he is now I believe born again of God. He is a little Child, and often (as he told me) receives ſuch Communications from God, when he retires into the Woods, that he thinks he could die a Martyr for the Truth.</q>
The next is one
<q>CAPTAIN H—L, formerly as great a Reprobate as ever I heard of: Almoſt a Scandal and Reproach to human Nature. He uſed to ſwear to eaſe his Stomach, and was ſo fond of new Oaths that he uſed to go on Board the Tranſport Ships, and offer a Guinea for a new Oath, that he might have the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of coining it. It would be endleſs to give In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of his vile Profaneneſs. To the Honour of God's Grace let it be ſaid, he is now, I believe a Chriſtian. Not only reformed, but renewed. The ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual Stroke, he told me, was given, when I preached laſt Spring at <hi>Pennypack,</hi> tho' under good Impreſſions before. Ever ſince he has been zealous for the Truth, ſtood like a Lamb when he was beaten, and in Danger of being murdered ſome Time ago, by many of my Oppoſers, and, in ſhort, ſhews forth his Faith by his Works.</q>
I might ſpeak alſo of ſome Quakers, who are fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <q>Whatever Men's carnal Reaſoning may ſuggeſt, yet if the Children of God fairly examine their own Experiences, if they do God Juſtice, they muſt acknowledge that they did not chuſe God, but God choſe them. And if he choſe them at all, it muſt be from Eternity, and that too without any Regard to any Thing foreſeen in them. Unleſs they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge this, Man's Salvation muſt be in Part owing to the Free-Will of Man, and it ſo, unleſs Men deſcend from other Parents then I did, Chriſt Jeſus might have died, and never have ſeen the Travel of his Soul in the Salvation of one of his Creatures. But I would be tender in this Point, and leave Perſons to be taught it of God. I am of the Martyr <hi>Bradford's</hi> Mind.</q>
                  <hi>Let a Man go to the Grammar School of Faith and Repentance, before he goes to the Univerſity of Election and Predeſtination.</hi> A bare Head-Knowledge of the Form of ſound Words availeth nothing.

it was of God.— The Word ſeemed to ſmite them like ſo many pointed Arrows Many afterwards told me what they felt, and in the Evening I was ſent for to a young Woman, who was carried Home from Meeting, and had continued almoſt ſpeechleſs When I came, ſhe look'd like a Perſon dead and laid out. I prayed with her, and heard afterwards that ſhe came out into a more comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble State. — <hi>Bleſſed be the Name of the Lord.</hi> Indeed I cannot ſay we had one dry Meeting. The leaſt Moving, I think, was one Afternoon, when I was unaccountably car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out to talk againſt Reaſoning Unbelievers. When I was at Dinner I had not fixed upon a Text. When I was going to preach, I was ſo ill that ſome of my Friends ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed me to go home. I thought it beſt to truſt to God. I went on, began Preaching, and found my Heart ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what refreſhed, but all on a ſudden, my Soul was ſo carried out to talk againſt depending on our natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that my Friends were aſtoniſhed, and ſo was I too: For I felt the Holy Ghoſt come upon me at that Time, and never ſpake on that wiſe before. As I was going home, I ſaid to a Friend,
<q>Surely ſome Reaſoners were in the Congregation.</q>
Upon Enquiry, I found a Cluſter of them were preſent, and then knew wherefore I was ſo aſſiſted. <hi>Oh who would but truſt in God</hi>! One of theſe Reaſoners a little after, meeting Mr. <hi>B—n,</hi> ſaid,
<q>What! Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> could not make the People cry this After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon.</q>
                  <q>A good Reaſon for it, ſays Mr. <hi>B—n,</hi> he was preaching againſt Deiſts, and you know they are a harden'd Generation.</q>
                  <hi>Lord take from them a Heart of Stone, and give them a Heart of Fleſh. Abba, Father, all Things are poſſible with thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another Afternoon, there was ſuch an univerſal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion in the Congregation, as I never ſaw in <hi>Philadelphia</hi> before. One or two cried out in a moſt pitious Manner, and Numbers wept ſo ſorely, that I broke off Prayer after Sermon ſooner than otherwiſe I ſhould have done. The Children of God were melted down, and their Souls mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified

the Lord. I preached on theſe Words, <hi>What ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> And as I afterwards found, was very providentially directed to that Subject. For one Mrs. <hi>P—r,</hi> as I have it in a Paper taken from her own Mouth, went to Mr. <hi>Cummings</hi> to know,
<q>Why I ſhould not preach in the Church?</q>
He, after ſeveral Invectives caſt out againſt me, ſaid, <hi>He could not anſwer his Oath to the Biſhop of</hi> London, <hi>if he did give me Leave,</hi> and caution'd her againſt going to hear me; adding, <hi>That if ſhe followed or adhered to what I ſaid, ſhe was in a woful Condition.</hi> Nay, ſaid he. <hi>You are damned if you do.</hi> With all, he told her, <hi>He was diſtreſſed in his Soul for her, becauſe ſhe was a good Liver, and brought up under pious Parents.</hi> Mrs. <hi>P—r</hi> asked,
<q>If ſhe, by God's Aſſiſtance, could live up to the Doctrine and Example of our Saviour and the Apoſtles, as laid down in the New Teſtament, ſhe ſhould not do well?</q>
He anſwered,

<q>Then, Sir, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied ſhe,

But his Bow abode in Strength, and the Arms of his Hands were made-ſtrong, by the Hands of the mighty God of Jacob.</hi> And, at another Time, when my Soul was dejected at a Senſe of my own Weakneſſes, and the Number and Greatneſs of my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending Trials, the Lord raiſed and comforted me with this Promiſe: <hi>Fear thou not, for I am with thee: Be not diſmayed, for I am thy God: I will ſtrengthen thee, yea, I will help thee, yea, I will uphold thee with the Right Hand of my Righteouſneſs.</hi> The Books of <hi>Geneſis</hi> and <hi>Exodus,</hi> which I expounded in Courſe, Morning and Evening, were much bleſſed to my ſpiritual Comfort. And the Lord has been pleaſed to give me Freedom to write down ſome of my extempore Diſcourſes, which I hope he will bleſs for his own Name's Sake. In ſhort, this Voyage has been a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Voyage to my Soul, becauſe of my having had many ſweet Opportunities for Reading, Meditation and Prayer. I cannot but adore the Providence of God in ſavouring me with ſuch bleſſed Retirements as I have frequently enjoyed on the great Waters. I dared not expect to meet with ſuch Succeſs as he has been pleaſed to give me abroad: And I doubt not but I ſhall yet ſee greater Things there as well as at home.
