            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE public are at length preſented with the Report of a Trial, which has awakened unuſual ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude among all claſſes of people. When it was promiſed at an earlier day, it was not foreſeen what degree of labor and painful attention would be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to render it correct. A ſtrong wiſh to make it minutely accurate and ſtrictly impartial has neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily protracted the publication to this time. No labor has been ſpared to obtain this end: five other note-books beſides my own, have been examined and the whole have been carefully collated, and if there is any merit in the performance it lies in its cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectneſs. The teſtimony of the principal witneſſes is given in their own words, that the reader may better weigh their reſpective claims to belief: this is what he can never be fairly enabled to do when the reporter undertakes to ſtate the amount of the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, inſtead of the teſtimony itſelf, thereby giving nothing more than the impreſſions it made upon his own mind. In the peruſal of the following ſheets, it is hoped, ſomething more may be found than the gratification of a temporary curioſity. The critical obſerver of manners, and the philoſopher who makes the human heart his ſtudy, will, it is believed, be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled from the picture here preſented, to catch a glance at ſome features of real life.—He will here ſee the advantage which truth poſſeſſes over prevarication and falſhood.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:038372_0004_1011CFBB378D4488"/>
I cannot help noticing two pamphlets which have already appeared, both pretending to exhibit a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect report of this trial.</p>
            <p>The firſt is publiſhed by one Longworth, and was in print a few hours after the trial was over. This man has ſeized with avidity upon the moment, when public curioſity was all alive, and if we may credit his own avowal without regard to any thing but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muneration, he has publiſhed juſt ſuch an account as might naturally be expected from a man acting from ſuch motives. I ſhould not have deſcended to notice this paltry performance here, had he not put it off by the inſinuation of a falſhood. It has been trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peted round the ſtreets as <hi>"The whole Trial of Levi Weeks, taken in ſhort hand by a gentleman of the bar."</hi> Although he may feel a preſent gratification from the ſucceſs with which the artifice has been attended, yet it is hoped he will find, in the end, that the public will not eaſily forget ſo groſs an impoſition.</p>
            <p>The other appears under the name of James Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and is fairly ſuffered to find its ſale in Bookſell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's ſhops, without the aid of impoſture. But in his ſtatement of the teſtimony, he has involved ſome of the witneſſes in poſitive and material contradictions, where in reality there were none. This may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for from the unfavourable ſituation in which he ſat to take his notes, as well as from ſome other circumſtances not irreconcilable with the moſt inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent intentions; but ſurely a conſcientious man cannot but feel ſome degree of uneaſineſs, that he has done a thing in the face of the public—at once, ſo injurious to truth, and to the individual who is affected by it. Theſe remarks are made with ſome reluctance upon a man, who I am told, has a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable ſhare of literary merit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:038372_0005_1011CFBE0E3BB8F8"/>
On the queſtion of the Guilt or Innocence of the accuſed, I ſhall ſay nothing, as I conceive it is not the province of an individual to re-judge his caſe or arraign the verdict of his peers. After a long and impartial trial, his country have pronounced him Innocent, and the language of that verdict muſt be concluſive. A faithful exhibition of the facts on which that deciſion was built, is all that is aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me, and this duty I have endeavoured to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge to the beſt of my ability.</p>

            <head>TRIAL, &amp;c. MONDAY, MARCH 31.</head>
            <p>THE Court aſſembled at 10 o'clock in the forenoon, and proclamation having been made in the uſual form, the priſoner was put to the Bar.</p>
            <p>The Pannel was then called, and thirty-four Jurors appeared and anſwered to their names. The Clerk then addreſſed the priſoner, "Levi Weeks, priſoner at the bar, hold up your right hand, and hearken to what is ſaid to you.—Theſe good men who have been laſt called, and who do now appear, are thoſe who are to paſs between the People of the State of New-York, and you, upon your Trial of Life and Death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If, therefore, you will challenge them, or ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them, your time to challenge is, as they come to the book to be ſworn, and before they are ſworn, and you will be heard."</p>
            <p>The Clerk then proceeded to call the Jury from the Pannel, and the firſt having come up, and being deſired to place his hand upon the book, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed himſelf to the Juror and the Priſoner; "Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, look upon the Priſoner; Priſoner, look upon the Juror—and adminiſtered the following Oath: "You ſhall well and truly try, and true deliverance make, between the People of the State of New-York, and Levi Weeks the priſoner at the bar, whom you ſhall have in charge, and a true verdict give accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

to evidence, ſo help you God." All the Quakers upon the Pannel, excepting James Hunt, as they were called, came up to the Court and requeſted to be excuſed from ſerving on the Jury, as they had ſcruples of conſcience which prohibited them from ſitting to determine on a caſe of life and death—and the court excuſed them accordingly.</p>
            <p>The priſoner challenged eleven of the Jurors, who were ſet aſide of courſe; the Aſſiſtant Attorney Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral alſo challenged one for ſome expreſſions which he had been informed had dropt from him, but finding it could not be ſupported, he gave it up.</p>

            <p>Upon this Indictment the priſoner at the bar hath been arraigned, and on his arraignment, hath plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not guilty, and is now to be tried by his country,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:038372_0010_1011CFCDE9FE2328"/>
which country you are; ſo that your charge is, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, to enquire whether the priſoner at the bar is guilty of the felony whereof he ſtands Indicted, or is not guilty; ſo fit together and hear your evidence."</p>
            <p>The Aſſiſtant Attorney General, Mr. Colden, then addreſſed the Court and Jury:</p>
            <p>"In a cauſe which appears ſo greatly to have excit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the public mind, in which the priſoner has thought it neceſſary for his defence, to employ ſo many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates diſtinguiſhed for their eloquence and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſo vaſtly my ſuperiors in learning, experience and profeſſional rank; it is not wonderful that I ſhould riſe to addreſs you under the weight of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſments which ſuch circumſtances naturally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite. But gentlemen, although the abilities enlift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the reſpective ſides of this cauſe are very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal, I find conſolation in the reflection, that our taſks are ſo alſo. While to my opponents it belongs as their duty to exert all their powerful talents in favour of the priſoner, as a public proſecutor, I offer you in its proper order, all the teſtimony the caſe affords, draw from the witneſſes which may be produced on either ſide all that they know, and if I can guard you againſt the influence of ſophiſtry and eloquence, I ſhall be ſatisfied. Had I the power of enlisting the paſſions and biaſſing the judgement, which thoſe oppoſed to me poſſeſs, I ſhould think it unjuſtifiable to exert it on ſuch an occaſion.</p>
            <p>Levi Weeks, the priſoner at the bar, is indicted for the murder of Gulielma Sands. He is a young man of reputable connections, and for ought we know, till he was charged with this crime, of irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachable character, nay of amiable and engaging manners, inſomuch that he had gained the affections of thoſe who are now to appear againſt him as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes on this trial for his life. Theſe are circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:038372_0011_1011CFCF70CEDF80"/>
greatly in his favour, and there is no reaſon to fear that they will not be urged with all their force. We are aware that you will not convict ſuch a one of the horrid crime of which he is accuſed upon leſs than the utmoſt evidence that the nature of the caſe admits, and that you will not readily be convinced that one ſo young has already embrued his hands in the blood of the innocent.</p>
            <p>The deceaſed was a young girl, who till her fatal acquaintance with the priſoner, was virtuous and modeſt, and it will be material for you to remark, always of a cheerful diſpoſition, and lively manners, though of a delicate conſtitution. We expect to prove to you that the priſoner won her affections, and that her virtue fell a ſacrifice to his affiduity; that after a long period of criminal intercourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, he deluded her from the houſe of her, protector under a pretence of marrying her, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried her away to a well in the ſuburbs of this city, and there murdered her.—<hi>(Here the Aſſiſt. Att'y Gen. ſuddenly ſtopped a few ſeconds.)</hi>—No wonder, gentlemen that my mind ſhudders at this picture, and requires a moment to recollect itſelf.</p>
            <p>In order to enable you to direct your attention the better to the teſtimony that will be offered, I ſhall proceed to detail to you more particularly the proof which I expect will be made.</p>
            <p>I will not ſay gentlemen, what may be your verdict as to the priſoner, but I will venture to affert, that not one of you or any man who hears this cauſe, ſhall doubt that the unfortunate young creature who was found dead in the Manhattan well, was moſt barbarouſly murdered.</p>
            <p>Elias Ring, and Catherine his wife, keep a board<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-houſe in the upper part of Greenwich-ſtreet; the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:038372_0012_1011CFD1399D5420"/>
deceaſed was a diſtant relation of theirs who lived with them. Hope Sands, a ſiſter of Mr. Ring, and Margaret Clark, lived in the ſame houſe. In July laſt, the priſoner was received into the houſe as a boarder. Upon his firſt coming, for about a month, he ſhewed ſome attention to Margaret Clark, but ſoon after was obſerved to attach himſelf in a very particular manner to the deceaſed. Their conduct ſoon led to ſuſpicions in the family, that there was an improper intercourſe between them. In the month of September, Mrs. Ring fled from the fever, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the care of her houſe to her huſband, and the deceaſed; and leaving in it alſo the priſoner and ſome other boarders. Mrs. Ring remained out of town a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſix weeks, and in that time it is certain that the priſoner and the deceaſed lived together in the moſt intimate manner. On the firſt of December laſt, the deceaſed diſcloſed to Hope Sands, that on the next Sunday ſhe was to be married to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, but at this time, and whenever afterwards ſhe ſpoke on the ſubject, enjoined on Hope the ſtricteſt ſecrecy, forbidding her to tell even Mrs. Ring, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Levi meant to keep their marriage a ſecret, even from her (Hope) and therefore that no one ſhould go with them to ſee the ceremony perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>Between this time and the time of her departure from the houſe, it will be ſeen, ſhe frequently ſpoke of her approaching marriage, and always with cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and a lively pleaſure. On Saturday, the 21ſt of December, the day before the fatal accident—Hope diſcloſed the ſecret to Mrs. Ring, informing her, that Elma was to be married the next evening. On the Sunday about dinner-time, Mrs. Ring diſcovered to the deceaſed, that ſhe knew her intentions. The deceaſed, you will find, then confeſſed that ſhe was to
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:038372_0013_1011CFD2D327DAB8"/>
be married, and that the priſoner was to come for her that night at 8 o'clock. Mrs. Ring preſſed the deceaſed to be of the party—She ſaid Levi would not conſent, as he meant to keep his marriage a perfect ſecret from all. In the evening you will ſee, the deceaſed began to dreſs herſelf, in which Mrs. Ring aſſiſted her; the deceaſed appeared perfectly cheerful all this time, ſhe put on her hat and ſhawl, and went to a neighbor's and borrowed a muſſ which ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to return in a little time. She alſo took up a pocket-handkerchief belonging to one of the boarders, ſaying ſhe ſhould not make uſe of it, and would return it before it was miſſed. You will have evidence that the priſoner had left the houſe of Mr. Ring, about five o'clock in the afternoon, and that about eight o'clock in the evening the deceaſed ſtood leaning over the front door, looking out—that Mrs. Ring deſired her to come in, ſaying, ſhe did not believe Levi would come, to which ſhe anſwered, ſhe did not fear, it was not yet eight, but ſhe left the door and went in with Mrs. Ring, and in a little time the priſoner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, and came into the room where was Elias Ring, Mrs. Ring, the deceaſed, and two boarders, by the names of Lacey and Ruſſel. Mrs. Ring <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> with them about five minutes, when ſhe got up and went to the ſtreet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>door, and leaned over it till Lacey and Ruſſel went up-ſtairs to bed. She then left the ſtreet door, and as ſhe does perfectly remember, ſhut it after her; ſhe went into the room again, and was hardly seated when the deceaſed went up ſtairs; Mrs. Ring immediately followed her, found her in her room above, pinned on the ſhawl for her, and after being with her not more than two minutes, left her in the room oppoſite the ſtairs, juſt on the point of coming down. Mrs. Ring returned to the room below where the priſoner was; in about a minute he
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:038372_0014_1011CFD467AA7AE0"/>
took up his hat, and as he opened the room-door to go out, Mrs. Ring heard ſomebody come lightly down the ſtairs, and as ſhe ſuppoſes, meet him at the bottom; ſhe then heard two voices whiſpering at the foot of the ſtairs for about a minute, ſhe then heard the ſtreet door open and immediately ſhut, ſhe took a candle and went to the door to look after them but it was dark and ſo many people paſſing, that ſhe could not diſtinguish any one. The ſtreet door you will find, opens with a great and remarkable noiſe, in conſequence of its being out of order. Gentlemen, it will be neceſſary for you to pay particular attention to this part of the evidence, for if you do believe that the priſoner, at this time, went out of the houſe with the deceaſed—I do not ſee how he can be acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. After Mrs. Ring ſhut the door, it was not again opened till the time when ſhe ſuppoſes the priſoner and the deceaſed went out. We ſhall ſhow you that there were no other perſons in the houſe till ten or eleven o'clock, but Elias Ring, who remained in the common ſitting room, and the two lodgers, Lacey and Ruſſel, who we ſhall prove to you lodged together, and were not out of their lodging-room, from the time they went up ſtairs. From this time the deceaſed was never after ſeen till her corps was found in the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hattan Well. She had the marks of great violence upon her, and great part of her cloaths were torn off.</p>
            <p>We ſhall produce a number of witneſſes, who, between the hours of 8 &amp; 9 of the evening of the 22d of December, heard, from about the place of the well, the voice of a female crying murder, and entreating for mercy. It will be ſhown to you, gentlemen, that there was the track of a ſingle horſe ſleigh, which we ſhall prove that at ſome time between the Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day night before, and Monday morning ſucceeding,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:038372_0015_1011CFDC47D5FF28"/>
muſt have come out of Greenwich ſtreet, and paſſed in a very extraordinary manner near the brink of the well; that the snow round the edge of the well was much trodden, and that the ſleigh after having made a curious turn or ſtop near the well, muſt have paſſed on to the Broadway road, and in coming into that, turned towards town.</p>
            <p>We ſhall proceed to ſhew you, that on the evening after the 22d of December, ſoon after the deceaſed left her houſe, ſhe was met a few hundred yards from her houſe in the way towards the road that leads to the well, in company with two men. That a few hundred yards further on, and about the ſame time, a ſingle horſe ſleigh was ſeen with two men and a woman in it; the horſe of a dark colour and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bells, paſſing on towards the road or ſtreet which leads from Greenwich ſtreet to the well.</p>
            <p>Our next teſtimony will be, to prove to you, that a number of young gentlemen riding for pleaſure on the ſame evening, as they were coming into town, between 8 and 9 o'clock, on the Broadway road, when they were ſome diſtance nearer to the town than the place where the track of the one horſe ſleigh was diſcovered to have turned into the Broadway road, they were overtaken by a ſingle horſe ſleigh, which paſſed them with the horſe on a full gallop<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and without bells; there were two men in it and the horſe was dark coloured. We ſhall then ſhow you that Mr. Ezra Weeks, the brother of the priſoner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was the owner of a ſingle ſleigh, and a dark horſe, and that the priſoner had acceſs to it when he choſe, and we ſhall produce to you ſuch teſtimony, as we ſuppoſe will ſatisfy you that this horſe and ſleigh was taken out of the yard of Ezra Weeks, about 8 o'clock in the evening of the 22d of December, and
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:038372_0016_1011CFDF33A89048"/>
was returned again into the yard in leſs than half an hour.</p>
            <p>You will ſee, gentlemen of the Jury, that we have only circumſtantial evidence to offer to you in this caſe, and you muſt alſo perceive that from its nature it admits of no other. I ſhall, however, reſerve my remarks upon this ſubject, for a future ſtage in the cauſe; and ſhall, without delaying you longer, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to call the witneſſes.</p>
            <p>The Counſel for the priſoner moved the Court for permiſſion to take the teſtimony of Elizabeth Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins, who was now in an adjoining houſe, on the following affidavit of Joſeph Watkins:</p>

            <p>Mr. Aſſiſtant-Attorney-General ſaid, that he ſhould not now make any objections to it, as it appeared that the ſituation of the witneſs was ſuch that her perſonal attendance was abſolutely impoſsible. Whereupon, Mr. Juſtice Lansing went with the Aſſiſtant-Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-General and Gen. Hamilton, to take the depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the witneſs. After they has returned into Court, the firſt witneſs on the part of the proſecution was called.</p>
            <p>CATHARINE RING affirmed.—[It was now moved that the huſband of the witneſs, being alſo a witneſs, ſhould withdraw out of hearing during her
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:038372_0017_1011CFE2EF468230"/>
examination, which the court ordered, ſaying the priſoner had a right to it of courſe, if he requeſted it.]</p>
            <p>The witneſs then proceeded:</p>
            <p>In July laſt Levi weeks came to board in our family, ſoon after which he began to pay attention to Margaret Clark, till about the 28th of the 8th Month, when ſhe went into the country. About two days after her abſence, Gulielma Sands <hi>"asked me"</hi>—Here ſhe was ſtopped by the counſel for the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, who prayed the opinion of the Court, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any declarations of the deceaſed were admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as evidence. They contended that this was a caſe of hear-ſay teſtimony, and did not come within any of the exceptions in the books.—They admitted that the declarations of a murdered perſon were ſometimes received as evidence againſt a priſoner, but it was only when they were made after the fatal blow, in his laſt moments and when he muſt be ſuppoſed to be under an equal ſolemnity with that of an oath.</p>
            <p>The Attorney-General inſiſted that ſuch teſtimony was proper to ſhow the diſpoſition of mind in the deceaſed, when ſhe left the houſe on the night of the fatal accident; that this was the only way to diſcover whether ſhe was found in her intellects, or whether ſhe was not under the impreſſions of melancholy—and that in reality, this was one of thoſe caſes, where evidence was to be admitted upon the neceſſity of the thing. To ſupport his argument he produced 4 State Trials, 487, 488, idem 291, 298; Leeche's caſes, 399, idem 397, idem 437; 2 Bacon 563; Skinner's Reports 402.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr. B. Livingston</hi> replied. He denied that State Trials was any authority. The caſe in Skinner he ſaid was certainly not law; and he read an authority from Hawkins, P. C. 447, and the caſe from Leech, 347, was in oppoſition to the principle contended for on the other ſide.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:038372_0018_1011CF2B9009F118"/>
               <hi>Col. Burr</hi> ſubjoined a few remarks. After ſtating what he thought ought to be the only exception to receiving hear-ſay evidence, <abbr>viz.</abbr> That it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to caſes <hi>in extremis</hi> after the fatal blow given, he obſerved, that beſides that the book is no authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the firſt caſe read by the Aſſiſtant-Attorney-General, the witneſs was ſuffered to proceed without interruption, and no point was made to the Court reſpecting it. As to the 2d. caſe, it wasin the court of ſeſſions in Scotland, and could not be conſidered as any authority here. He affirmed that Woodcock's caſe, although produced on the other ſide, was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly conſiſtent with the opinion which he held.</p>
            <p>The Court unanimouſly refuſed to admit the teſtimony.</p>
            <p>The witneſs then went on, being told to ſuppreſs whatever Elmore <hi>had said</hi> to her.—"Elmore lived in our houſe with us three years, as our child. After Margaret Clark had gone into the country a few days, Levi became very attentive to Elmore, to whom I mentioned it, and ſhe did not deny it. She and Levi were left together with my huſband either the 10th or the 11th of the 9th month.</p>

               <p> In the front room, ſecond ſtory.</p>
               <p>After I had been abſent about 4 weeks, I received a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er from my huſband, deſiring me to come home as he was very loneſome. I at firſt determined to return imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, but I always thought Levi a man of honor, and that he did not intend to promiſe further than he intended to perform; therefore I ſtayed two weeks longer, and I came home ſix weeks to a day. After my return I paid ſtrict attention to their conduct, and ſaw an appearance of mutual attachment, but nothing improper; and always diſcovered ſufficient in their countenance to convince me what was in agitation between them; and he was frequently in the room when ſhe was ſick. In a ſhort time after my return,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:038372_0019_1011CFEE110B4FD0"/>
ſhe concluded to pay a viſit to her friends in the country, though ſhe did not ſeem very anxious to go as it was ſo late in the ſeaſon; however, after ſhe got ready to go, Levi accompanied her to the veſſel, and ſhe ſtayed about two weeks. During her indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition he paid her the ſtricteſt attention, and ſpent ſeveral nights in the room, ſaying he did not like to leave her with Hope, (my ſiſter) fearing ſhe might get to ſleep and neglect her; and in the night he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to go for a phyſician, but I diſcouraged him, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe would get better by the morning. One night, after ſhe had got much better, chuſing to ſleep alone, ſhe went to bed; and as I ſuppoſed, Levi was gone alſo. <hi>(Here the counſel for the priſoner ſtopped the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to inform the court that Elias Ring, although order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, had returned and was ſtanding behind his wife the witneſs; the court ordered the conſtable to take him out, and reprimanded him for his behaviour.)</hi> In about two hours I thought I would ſtep up into her room and ſee how ſhe did—I ſlipped off my ſhoes, and going quick without making much noiſe, I partly opened the door, and ſaw him ſitting by the ſide of her bed, and the door was ſhut againſt me, I took it to be by him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe was in bed and could not reach the door.—The next morning he ſaid he had made a fire juſt before day in his own room, and he diſcovered more concern than I expected.</p>
               <p>Not a day paſſed but convinced me more and more that he was paying his attentions to her; I often found ſitting and ſtanding together, and once in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular I found them ſitting together on her bed. On the 22nd of December, my ſiſter Hope went to meeting, and Levi went to his brother's; in a ſhort time he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, having fallen and hurt his knee, which circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, it ſtruck my mind, would prevent their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for that time; Sylvanus Ruſſel ſaid, Levi you
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:038372_0020_1011CFEF9BDA2080"/>
won't be able to go out to-day—He anſwered, I am determined to, to-night. Elma then dreſſed his knee for him—it was not much of a hurt—I ſaw it—ſhe got a plaiſter. After ſhe had dreſſed it—he went up ſtairs a ſhort time—ſhe alſo followed him, and was gone I ſhould ſuppoſe, conſiderably more than an hour, this was about noon. His apprentice came down to do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and in a little time went up, but ſoon, returned again; the thought ſtruck me that they had ſent him down to get him out of the way. Between 12 and 1 o' clock ſhe came down into the room where I was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring dinner, with a ſmiling countenance, and ſeemed much pleaſed. I ſpent the afternoon with her; her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and behaviour was calm and compoſed, and fully happy, as likewiſe her appetite remarkably good. I left her a ſhort time, and went into another room; when I returned, I found Levi ſitting by the ſire with her, appearing fully compoſed and happy; but he ſoon left us and went up ſtairs—ſhortly after Elma went alſo; in about 20 minutes ſhe returned not quite dreſſed, with her handkerchief in her hand, ſaying to me, "which looks beſt?" Then Levi came down, nearly dreſſed alſo, with his coat upon his arm, at which time, Elma ſtepped behind the curtain of the bed. "He ſaid, "where's Elma?" I ſaid, "ſhe is hid behind the bed." He ſaid dont mind me—I want you to tie my hair. Elma came out and did ſo; Elias came in from meeting, and ſhe went up ſtairs, and Levi after her: this was about ſun-ſet, and ſhe did not come down till after dark, and Levi I believe ſtaid as long, for one of the family went up and found them together. I had got tea ready and waited ſome time for them to drink tea, thinking they would drink tea together; but he did not come. After tea I propoſed borrowing a muff for her at one of our neighbor's—ſhe ſaid would go herſelf, and ſhe went and got it.

I came down and left her in the room and came in where Elias and Levi were ſitting; no other perſon was up in the houſe but we four. I ſet the candle down over the fire-place, Levi inſtantly took his hat and went out into the entry; the moment the door opened, I heard a walking on the ſtairs, and directly I heard a whiſpering near the door, at the bottom of the ſtairs for nearly a minute, but ſo near the door I thought I might underſtand what was ſaid, and I liſtened for that purpoſe; ſoon I heard them ſtep along, and the front door opened and the latch fell. I took up the candle and run to the door to ſee which way they went; it was moonlight, but having a candle made it darker.</p>

               <p> No:—Feeling very uneaſy and agitated, I thought I would ſpeak to Levi more particularly than I had done, and I told Elias to go to bed, and I would

fix the child and bring it to him; and he got up to go, upon which Levi inſtanly rofe and went up ſtairs. I thought ſhe had gone to one of the neighbours to leave the muff; I was then determined to ſit up until ſhe ſhould come in: I accordingly put out the candle and covered up the fire, ſuppoſing that perhaps he would come down after he thought us a bed, and let bet in; after waiting till about 12 o'clock and nothing appearing, I lit the candle and ſearched the houſe, thinking perhaps that ſhe had come in; and went to every room excepting that where the two lodgers was a bed, and to Levi's room; I went to his door twice, but ſeemed as if I had not power to enter, I thought perhaps ſhe might be ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by Levi's ſtove. I then went to bed, and my huſband was much ſurprized at my conduct in ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up and ſearching through the houſe: I thought perhaps ſhe had ſtayed at Henry Clements.

Have you ſent any where for her? I anſwered no. He ſaid, why have not you? I anſwered, I did not think of ſending, expecting her in every minute.

ſend for it, and the girl ſhould fetch it home as I expected Elma was at Henry Clements, ſhe anſwered ſhe would ſit with me, and ſat down, during which time Levi came in, and fat until the girl returned, ſaying, Elma had not been there. I was ſtruck with aſtoniſhment, although my uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs had been great, yet I fully expected ſhe was there; the perſon immediately ſaid, I gueſs ſhe has gone to be married, and that made her borrow my muff; I anſwered, married or not I think it very ungenerous not to return it, and likewiſe to keep me in ſuſpence and uneaſineſs; at which converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Levi gave no anſwer, but ſet with his head down, and then he went out. Soon after this my ſiſter returned; in a ſhort time after Levi came in, ſhe immediately attacked him, ſaying, where is El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, I know thee knows, tell me ingenuouſly for Caty is very uneaſy, and ſays Elma told her ſhe was going with thee, and ſhe is ſure ſhe did; he looked ſurprized, and ſaid, <hi>ſhe told Caty ſo?</hi> why if ſhe had went with me, ſhe would have returned with me; I never ſaw her after ſhe left the room, and am ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized you would think of my keeping you in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence. The day paſſed without much more being ſaid, expect my ſaying I had been to the door fifty times to look for her; he anſwered he had looked more than fifty times, he could not keep his eyes from the ſtreet. The next morning being Tueſday the 24th, after the boarders had breakfaſted, none of the family up but them and myſelf, they all went out excepting Levi, who ſeeing me much diſtreſſed walked the room ſeveral times, appearing much agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, came to me, and taking hold of my arm, ſaid,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:038372_0028_1011D005C47FEE88"/>
Mrs. Ring, don't grieve ſo, I am in hopes things will turn out better than you expect; to which I gave no anſwer, as I expected he was then going to tell me the whole matter. He ſoon however took his hat and went away. Nothing more was ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til afternoon, when myſelf and ſiſter being ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed we determined to ſtand it no longer, and we were about to ſend for him when he again came in, laid down his hat; but on ſeeing our agitation, he turned round and was going out; I ſaid, ſtop Levi, this matter has become ſo ſerious. I can ſtand it no longer; I then ſaid it certainly lays upon thee, therefore thee muſt make the beſt of thy way to get clear of it; he ſaid, he was willing to give what ſatisfaction he could, being ſorry to ſee us ſo diſtreſſed, when I ſaid if it had been many a perſon that I ſhould have even been willing for her to have, I would not have waited one hour before they ſhould have given an account of her, but my confidence in thee was ſo great, and fearing too to make her trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as ſhe was bound not to diſcloſe it, is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why I did not immediately mention it. I then proceeded. On firſt day after 12 o'clock, ſhe came down ſtairs after being with thee, and told me, that night at eight o'clock you were going to be married, that you did not go till 8 o'clock on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of its being froze. I had not proceeded much further, if any, before he turned pale; trembled to a great degree; was much agitated, and began to cry, claſping his hands together, cried out, I'm ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined—I'm ruined—I'm undone forever, unleſs ſhe appears to clear me—my exiſtence will be only a burden—I had rather die in credit, than live under it. Then he proceeded to clear himſelf, ſaying, he
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:038372_0029_1011D00988C719D0"/>
never would attempt to marry without his brother's approbation. I replied, ſhe told me, thee had talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him twice on the ſubject; he ſaid my brother can anſwer for himſelf. Thus he proceeded until we were hardly able to ſupport it; as our dependence as to her, was intirely upon him, not having a thought ſhort of his knowing where ſhe was.</p>
            <p>On Thurſday, the 26th of December, about 10 o'clock, Margaret Clark and her ſiſter Deborah Clark, being in the room with me, Levi came in; ſeeing us much diſtreſſed, he ſat down and endeavoured to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and conſole us, ſaying, <hi>Give her up, ſhe is gone no doubt, and all our grieving would do no good.</hi> With an earneſt look I turned to him, ſaying, Levi, give me thy firm opinion from the bottom of thy heart, for I dont doubt thee has one; tell me the truth, what thee thinks has become of her. He replied, <hi>Mrs. Ring, its my firm belief ſhe's now in eternity; it certainly is, therefore make yourſelf eaſy, for your mourning will never bring her back.</hi> I anſwered, why does thee ſay ſo? what reaſon has thee to think it? <hi>Why from things I've heard her drop.</hi> What were they I aſked. <hi>Why I heard her ſay ſhe wiſhed ſhe never had an exiſtence.</hi> I replied, if thee recollects, I dont doubt thee has heard me ſay ſo, I acknowledge it's wrong and have reproved her for it.</p>

How can thee ſay ſo? as it was always eaſy for her to get that, it dont bear the weight of a ſingle ſtraw with me, and the circumſtance thee alludes to, I believe I was preſent as well as ſeveral others, which he did not deny, nor mention any other time, which circumſtance was this, my ſiſter was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, the doctor had left a ſmall phial with her, and ſhe had it in her hand, clapped it up to her mouth, he ſaid Elma dont do ſo, ſhe replied I ſhould not be afraid to drink it if full, my huſband anſwered why the fooliſh creature it would kill thee, ſhe anſwered I ſhould not be afraid.

               <p>I frequently converſed with him on the ſubject, always pointing out the impoſſibility of any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons knowing it, all which he never reſented.

Well then let her go with my brother. Indeed I've no choice in thee or thy brother, if the authority calls for her, ſhe will anſwer I dare ſay to what's proper. He then ſaid Mrs. Ring, you are not ſo much my friend as you have been? Indeed Levi, I ſhudder to think I ever indulged a favourable thought of thee.</p>

She ſaid, the firſt time I knew them to be together in private, was about two weeks after I and Elma came to town. I then found Levi and Elma to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in her bed-room; I was there with Elma when Levi came in, on which Elma gave me a hint, I imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately went out, he followed me to the door and ſhut it after me, and locked it.—I went down ſtairs, left my ſhoes at the bottom of them, and went ſoftly up to liſten if I could hear their converſation, but could not underſtand any thing although I heard a whiſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſtaid at the door along time, more than an hour. Hearing ſome perſon come in below, I run down, where I found Doctor Snedeker; on my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the room, Peggy Clark took the candle and went up to the room where Levi and Elma were; on finding the door locked, ſhe returned, much ſurpriſed at finding it faſt, and asked me if I knew who was there, I anſwered I will go and ſee, ſhe followed me up to the door; finding it locked, we went into the next room, when the door was unlocked, and Levi came out. I obſerved to Levi that he intended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very ſafe, having ſecured the door that Peggy could not gain admittance; he then said, where is Peggy, and looked into the room—but ſhe ſtepped behind the door, ſo that he did not ſee her: he then left us and went up ſtairs. There was no light in the room when I left them, neither when he came out, therefore, I am poſitive they had not any. I then went in and found Elma ſitting on the bed.</p>

            <p>On Monday, the next day after ſhe was miſſing, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 10 or 11 o'clock in the forenoon, I met Levi up ſtairs alone. I attacked him about her—he denied knowing any thing of her, though from his looks I was confident he did. He ſoon began to uſe all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible means to convince me of his innocence. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied it was hard to judge one I had ſo good an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of, but he was certainly the perſon who could give information of her if he choſe.

            <p>The Sabbath evening after ſhe was miſſing, he came to me ſaying, Hope, if you can ſay any thing in my favor, do it, for you can do me more good than any friend I have in the world to clear me, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if you can ſay any thing, do it before the body is found, as after it will do me no good; but if the body is found a good way off, that will clear me, as I was not a ſufficient time from my brother's to go far. He then preſſed me very hard to go to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman's and ſee him, I refuſed; upon which he gave me a paper he had drawn, wiſhing me to ſign it: the purport of the paper was, That he had paid no more particular attention to Elma, than to any other female in the houſe—that nothing had paſſed between them like courtſhip, or looking like marriage. I took it from him, saying I ſuppoſed I might read it, and left him without ſaying any more on the ſubject till the day of the proceſſion. He then came to me ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Hope, will you accompany me to ſee the proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion? I replied no, I have ſeen proceſſions enough. He then said—Hope, dont you intend to ſign that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for me? I anſwered no, and drew it from my pocket; I then pointed out to him the inconſiſtency

of my doing it, saying—Levi, if I was to do it, thee knows it would be poſitive lies.

               <p> I ſupped that night at Mrs. Aſhmore's but that's not her real name; it is 884 Bowery lane; it was the birth day of her ſon—ſhe has had a good deal of my money, and I thot I would go and ſup with her.</p>
               <p>I went accordingly. In the courſe of the evening when the deceaſed was miſſing. I croſſed twice or three times from Greenwich-ſtreet to Broadway and was once<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at the Coffee-houſe; I went out to the Bowery and returned to Mrs. Ring's.</p>

One day my maſter ſaid to me, you muſt not think it ſtrange of my keeping Elma's company, it is not for courtſhip nor diſhonor, but only for converſation. One night I pretended to be aſleep, and the priſoner undreſſed himſelf, and came with the candle and looked to ſee if I was aſleep or not, ſuppoſing I was, he went down ſtairs in his ſhirt, and did not come back till morning.</p>

               <p>—On the Monday morning before Chriſtmas, I and my wife was coming to town in a wood ſleigh, and I diſcovered the track of a one-horſe ſleigh, about three hundred feet from the Manhattan Well, up the new road which Col. Burr had built, and I found the ſleigh had drove ſo near the wall, that I obſerved it was a wonder that it had not turned over. I had paſſed that way the Sunday morning before, and there was no track there then; the ſleigh appeared to have gone up towards the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loon-houſe;—I thought ſomebody had miſſed their way, for there was no road there, and this made me ſo particular in my obſervation. I obſerved that there was one board off the well, which left it open, it may be 12 or 13 inches—there was tracks of people round the well.</p>

               <p>—On the 2d of January laſt, I together with Mr. Page, had ſome buſineſs to do in breaking a horſe, and we went up to Andrew Blancks, and we dined there: Blanck inſiſted upon it. While we were dining two perſons, Mr. Watkins and Mr. Elias Ring, came there to get hooks and poles to ſound the Manhattan well for the body of a young woman who was ſuppoſed to be drowned. We got the poles and nails and went all together to the well, which we uncovered. Page took the pole firſt and ſaid he thought he felt her; I took hold then and thought I felt her too. Watkins drove in the nails, I took the pole and hooked the nail in her clothes and drew her up carefully to the top of the water: as ſoon as Mr. Ring ſaw her callico gown he ſaid it was ſhe, he knew the gown. She was ſo heavy now we could not draw her out by the nail and the little boy went for a rope to the next houſe, while I held her ſtill. I put the rope under her and drew her up gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſhe ſlew'd round but there was not a thread of her clothes which touched either ſide of the well. When ſhe was drawn up we laid her on a plank, and ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in ſuch a ſituation as if ſhe had been murdered.</p>

juſt above the waiſt, her ſhawl was off, and her hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief and ſhoes were gone; her hair hung over her head. In lifting her up I found her head fell for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and when we lifted her a little back her head fell back again, and again it fell to the right, which cauſed me to ſuppoſe her neck was broke. She had a white dimity petticoat on. I diſcovered on her right hand ſomething like a kick, there was the ſcraches of ſand upon her skin, ſome of which was knocked off and ſeemed to have been drove forward. Her ſtockings were, torn at the toes; the right foot was bare and ſomewhat ſcratched; the ſcratches were on the upper part of the foot, as if ſhe had been dragged on the ground.</p>

I told him I was very ſorry for his ſituation—I felt affected—I expreſſed it to him—he turned about and ſaid, It is too hard, and he dropped his head and ſaid Is it the Manhattan well ſhe was found in? I ſaid I knew not what well ſhe was found in; I did not then know the Manhattan-well—this was about half paſt three in the afternoon; however, I dont know exactly the time but by calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.

               <p> The only appearance which attracted my par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular attention was, an unuſual redneſs of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; and upon looking at the neck I obſerved three or four dark colored ſpots, of an irregular ſhape, but not in an exact line as if they had been produced by a cord, but rather the effect of a violent preſſure upon the neck—the hands were expoſed, and I obſerved upon the back of them ſeveral ſcratches.</p>

               <p>—I had a ſlight ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with Elma Sands: On the 22d of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, I lent her my muff, ſhe came to borrow it herſelf, and I obſerved that ſhe was very neatly dreſſed, and ſhe ſeemed to be very lively and very happy.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Q.</speaker>
               <p> When was the muff brought home to you?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p> It was brought home the day that ſhe was found, and it appeared as if it had been wet.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Q.</speaker>
               <p> Did you underſtand it was found in the well?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p> I did.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Some converſation ariſing, as to the time when the muff was found, it was admitted by the Attorney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>General, that it was found ſome days before the body was diſcovered.</p>
            <p>Mr. WILLIAMS teſtified that at the requeſt of the Attorney-General, he had made an experiment in what time a man might drive a horſe the moſt uſual rout from Ring's to the Manhattan well, and from there back again to Ezra Week's down Barley-ſtreet, and that although the roads were bad, he performed it once in 15 minutes and once in 16, without going out of a trot.</p>
            <p>SYLVESTER BUSKIRK was with the last witneſs at the time he ſpoke of, and corroborated what he ſaid. He teſtified that Ezra Week's houſe had ſtood in his ſtable for ſale, and was a good horſe to appearance.</p>
            <p>Mr. CROSS teſtified that he is acquainted with Ezra Week's horſe, and calls him a very good one, thinks he will go a mile in 5 minutes.</p>
            <p>The evidence being cloſed, the Aſſiſtant Attorney-General addreſſed a few words to the jury on the nature of circumſtantial evidence, and read the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing paſſage from Morgan's Eſſay, p. 208.</p>
            <p>Circumſtantial evidence is all that can be expected, and indeed all that is neceſſary to ſubſtantiate ſuch a
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:038372_0061_1011D303976238A8"/>
charge. The prejudice entertained againſt receiving circumſtantial evidence is carried to a pitch wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable. In ſuch a caſe as this it muſt be received, becauſe the nature of the enquiry, for the moſt part, does not admit of any other; and, conſequently, it is the beſt evidence that can poſſibly be given. But tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in a more general ſenſe, a concurrence of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances (which we muſt always ſuppoſe to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly authenticated, otherwiſe they weigh nothing) forms a ſtronger ground of belief than poſitive and direct teſtimony generally affords, eſpecially when unconfirmed by circumſtances. The reaſon of this is obvious: a poſitive allegation may be founded in miſtake, or, what is too common, in the perjury of the witneſs; but circumſtances cannot lie; and a long chain of well connected fabricated circumſtances, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires an ingenuity and skill rarely to be met with; and ſuch a conſiſtency in the perſons who come to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port thoſe circumſtances by their oaths, as the annals of our courts of juſtice can ſeldom produce. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, circumſtantial evidence is much more eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed, and much more eaſily contradicted by teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony if falſe, than the poſitive and direct allegation of a fact, which, being confined to the knowledge of an individual, cannot poſſibly be the ſubject of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction founded merely on preſumption and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</p>

               <pb n="64" facs="unknown:038372_0062_1011D3071A33A058"/>
The TESTIMONY on the part of the proſecution being cloſed, one of the Counsel for the Prisoner then opened the defence, and addreſſed the Jurors to the following effect:—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gentlemen of the Jury,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE patience with which you have liſtened to this lengthy and tedious detail of teſtimony is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable to your characters. It evinces your ſolicitude to diſcharge the awful duties which are impoſed upon you, and it affords a happy preſage, that your minds are not infected by that blind and undiſcriminating prejudice which had already marked the priſoner for its victim.</p>
            <p>You have relieved me from my greateſt anxiety, for I know the unexampled induſtry that has been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted to deſtroy the reputation of the accuſed, and to immolate him at the ſhrine of perſecution without the ſolemnity of a candid and impartial trial. I know that hatred, revenge and cruelty, all the vindictive and ferocious paſſions have aſſembled in terrible array and exerted' every engine to gratify their malice. The thouſand tongues of rumour have been ſteadily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the fabrication and diſſemination of falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods;, and every method has been taken to render their ſlanders univerſal. We have witneſſed the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary means which have been adopted to enflame the public paſſions and to direct the fury of popular reſentment againſt the priſoner. Why has the body been expoſed for days in the public ſtreets in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the moſt indecent and ſhocking?—to attract the curioſity and arouſe the feelings of numberleſs ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. Such dreadful ſcenes ſpeak powerfully to the paſſions: they petrify the mind with horror—congeal the blood within our veins—and excite the human boſom with irreſiſtible, but undefineable emotions.
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:038372_0063_1011D308CE69F100"/>
When ſuch emotions are once created they are not eaſily ſubdued.</p>
            <p>It has happened in this caſe, that there have been attempts made to call up public ſenſibility, to excite reſentment againſt this unfortunate man; in this way, gentlemen, the public opinion comes to be formed unfavourably, and long before the priſoner is brought to his trial he is already condemned. It is not to be ſuppoſed that theſe rumours can have any weight with a Court of Juſtice, but no man is altogether above being moved by ſuch reports—and it requires ſome fortitude to withſtand them; but now having heard the whole which can be ſaid, you are prepared to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine whether the witneſſes have always ſpoken with candor, or whether they have not ſpoken from tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, hatred and revenge.</p>
            <p>We rely on it at firſt that there is nothing from which a diſcreet Jury can condemn the priſoner; in the very commencement of the buſineſs it is involved in doubt. Notwithſtanding there may be teſtimony of an intimacy having ſubſiſted between the priſoner and the deceaſed, we ſhall ſhow you that there was nothing like a real courtſhip, or ſuch a courſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct as ought to induce impartial people to entertain a belief that marriage was intended; for it will be ſeen that she manifeſted equal partiality for other perſons as for Mr. Weeks. It will be ſhewn that ſhe was in the habit of being frequently out of evenings, and could give no good account of herſelf; that she had at ſome time aſſerted that she had paſt the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at houſes, where it afterwards appeared ſhe had not been. We shall show you that if ſuſpicions may attach any where, there are thoſe on whom they may be faſtened with more appearance of truth than on the priſoner at the bar. Certainly you are not in this place to condemn others, yet it will relieve your
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:038372_0064_1011D30C5C4BBE70"/>
minds of a burden. There will be two modes of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſolution—firſt, that the deceaſed ſometimes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared melancholy, that ſhe was a dependant upon this family, and that a gloomy ſenſe of her ſituation might have led her to deſtroy herſelf. As to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident of the ſleigh, we ſhall account for his whole time during that evening, except about 15 minutes, which was employed in walking from one houſe to another; and we ſhall ſhow you, that the whole of his conduct has been ſuch, as totally to repel the idea of guilt. It will appear, that at ten o'clock the same evening, he ſupped at his brother's perfectly tranquil. The ſtory you will ſee, is broken, diſconnected, and utterly impoſſible.—We ſhall ſhow you that the ſleigh of Ezra Weeks was not out that evening, indeed the teſtimony of the good old woman was ſuch, as could not gain the leaſt belief, eſpecially when you ſee that in matter of date and time ſhe was totally loſt: It will be ſhown you that on this occaſion there have been violent attempts, to inflame the public mind againſt the priſoner, and if we ſhall bring theſe home to ſome of the witneſſes, we hope you will pronounce them altogether unworthy of credit—for a man to foreſtall the public opinion, is to arreſt the hand of juſtice and deſerves the ſevereſt reprehension, and ſuch conduct we ſhall fix on the witneſſes.</p>
            <p>We ſhall ſhow you that the priſoner has been uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly well ſpoken of, more highly eſteemed than one of his years, not only for his deportment, but for his morals. That a man of ſuch a character ſhould be impelled, without motive, to the commiſſion of ſo horrid a crime, cannot be believed. Much has been ſaid about the appearance of guilt and terror in the priſoner when charged with the crime. But, gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, no man is armed with ſo much firmneſs of nerves that when charged with a crime, he will not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:038372_0065_1011D31110AC43C8"/>
great emotion; when, therefore, perſons of little diſcernment come forward and ſay that they ſaw emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of alarm and terror, no man however innocent as an angel, is ſafe; the emotions of ſurprize may be conſtrued by the ignorant or the malicious into thoſe of guilt. A man charged with a henious crime may even prevaricate; we ſhall ſhow you the caſe of a young man, who, being charged with the crime of murder, even brought a young woman dreſſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the one he was charged with murdering—this was ſuppoſed to be a circumſtance ſo concluſive of his guilt that he was convicted and executed, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the young woman was found to be alive. Even in this very city a caſe had occured, not many years ago, a young man had been charged with the crime of rape. It is yet freſh in the minds of every body. The public mind was there highly incenſed, and even after the unfortunate man had been acquitted by a verdict of a jury, ſo irritated and enflamed were the people, that the magiſtrates were inſulted, and they threatened to pull down the houſe of the priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's counſel. After that a civil ſuit was commenced for the injury done the girl, a very enormous ſum given in damages, and the defendant was ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly confined within the walls of a priſon. Now it has come out that the accuſation was certainly falſe and malicious.</p>
            <p>If this doctrine of preſumptive evidence is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, and to be ſufficient to convict, what remorſe of conſcience muſt a juror feel for having convicted a man who afterwards appeared to be innocent. In caſes depending upon a chain of circumſtance, all the fabric muſt hang together or the wuole will tumble down. We ſhall, however, not depend altogether on the weakneſs of proof on the part of the proſecution, we ſhall bring forward ſuch proof as will not leave to
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:038372_0066_1011D313C3811070"/>
you even to balance in your minds, whether the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner is Guilty or Not—from even that burden we ſhall relieve you.</p>
            <p>But before we come to the teſtimony, on the part of the priſoner, it may be well to examine a little more into the nature of the evidence on the part of the proſecution. It may be material to diſcover how much of this teſtimony which we have heard, is the effect of a prejudiced imagination; in caſes, people relate firſt with an honeſt zeal to relate as an opinion, next as a matter of fact. The only material facts on which I would obſerve here, is the expreſſion aſcribed to the priſoner, of the Manhattan Well, but that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance will be ſatiſfactorily accounted for, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to you that he had been previouſly informed that the muff had been found there, and it was therefore natural to enquire if the body was not found there alſo—If, gentlemen, we ſhow you all this, you will be able to ſay, before leaving your ſeats, that there is nothing to warrant you in pronouncing the priſoner Guilty.</p>

               <p>It was about 12 o'clock, as near as I can recollect, on the 2d day of January, the day when ſhe was found, that Levi Weeks came into our houſe to buy ſome tobacco—I asked him if there was any news of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more—he anſwered, no. I told him that I expected Ring's family had, for they ſeemed much agitated. He went away, and in about half an hour he came in again while we ſat at table, about one o'clock—I had heard before this about the muff's being found; Mrs. Ring had informed me—and I told him that Mrs. Ring had mentioned to me that the muff and

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p> About the middle of September, Mrs. Ring being in the country, I imagined one night I heard a ſhaking of a bed and conſiderable noiſe there, in the ſecond ſtory, where Elma's bed ſtood; the bed ſtood within four inches of the partition. I heard a man's voice and a woman's. I am very possitive that the voice was not Levi's.</p>

                  <hi>by one of the Jury.</hi> Could you hear through the partition?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Q.</speaker>
               <p> Did the noiſe of the bed continue any time?</p>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p> It continued ſome time and it muſt have been very loud to have awakened me. I heard a man's voice pretty loud and lively, and joking; the voice was loud and unguarded. I ſaid to my wife, it is Ring's voice, and I told my wife that girl will be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined next. I felt a good deal hurt at the time, but never mentioned it or any thing about it to any body afterwards, till after Elma was lost.</p>

                           <p> On Thursday evening, after Miss Sands was missing, Mrs. Ring came to see this deponent, and in conversation, said that Levi Weeks was one of the best, most civil, and kind hearted boarders that she ever had, and if any of the children were sick, he was as kind and attentive to them as if they were his own, and was remarkably affectionate and kind to them on the slightest complaints they made; and that his behaviour was invariably that of an amiable and obliging person.</p>

               <p>—I remember very well meeting Mr. Ring one day, on Sunday afternoon; he asked me if I had heard of a muff's being found any where? I replied it was an odd queſtion. He ſaid they were looking for a young woman who was miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, a relation of his wife's, and ſhe had been gone a week. I asked him what he ſuppoſed had become of her; either he or ſome perſon with him, ſaid they had reaſon to believe ſhe was drowned, and they ſuppoſed it was a love fit. I adviſed them to employ Mr. G. Walgrove, who was an expert perſon at ſweeping the river on ſuch occaſions. From what paſſed at that time I had no idea that Mr. Ring then thought ſhe was murdered.</p>

               <p> I remember that Mrs. Ring came into our houſe one morning and ſaid her boarders had gone out without breakfaſt, that Elma had been ſick all night, ever ſince ſhe came from our houſe, and ſhe thought it aroſe from her ſitting over our ſtove.

The body was then diſſected—I ſaw no extravaſations of blood—I ſaw no ſpots about the neck—I ſaw a little ſpot upon the breaſt, which I could cover with my thumb—I ſaw no marks of violence—I ſaw no appearances but what might be accounted for by ſuppoſing ſhe drowned her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>

               <speaker>Dr. MACKINTOSH.</speaker>
               <p>—I was called upon toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Dr. Prince, on the 3d of January laſt to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a Coroner's inqueſt on the body of Elma Sands, and I was deſired particularly, by the jury, to examine and ſee if ſhe was pregnant. There were no marks of violence—and we diſcovered, to the ſatisfaction of the jury, that ſhe was not pregnant. It was ſuggeſted by ſome of the jury that her neck was broke: I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined and found it was not, neither was the collar bone diſlocated. The ſcarf skin of the face was ſcratched as with gravel—near the inſtep there was a ſmall ſpot
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:038372_0076_1011D332E0E83D78"/>
like a blood bliſter. It ſeemed as if the knee had been injured by falling upon coarſe gravel—there was a ſpot upon the breaſt, but there were no marks of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence upon the belly—I think there were not marks of violence ſufficient to occaſion her death.</p>
               <p>I have been in the cuſtom of ſeeing numbers of drowned people who have been brought to the Alms-Houſe, and have often ſeen livid ſpots of the skin, much ſuch as I ſaw in this inſtance. I took it to be the effect of ſuffocation rather than of any thing elſe.</p>

            <p>Dr. ROMAYNE.—In anſwer to ſeveral queſtions put to the witneſs, he ſaid, I can not undertake to give any decided opinion upon appearances without ſeeing the body. Persons will vary extremely in the accounts they give, as well as in the concluſions they draw from appearances. The impreſſions upon the ſenſes, are
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:038372_0077_1011D338AF831218"/>
in many caſes remarkably nice and cannot be deſcribed, from the poverty of language, ſo as to convey correct ideas to others. An experienced perſon of good judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, might perhaps diſcover upon inſpection, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bruiſes made upon the body were done before or after death. A body which had been taken out of the water would aſſume a different appearance from what it had at firſt, in ten minutes after it was expoſed, to air, and every day the appearance of injury done, would acquire more viſibility as it advanced in putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. I have examined many bodies after death, by hanging, and never could diſcover that the red colour of the countenance was materially changed from what it was in life, or juſt before ſudden death. Preſſure upon the veins, ſo as to interrupt the circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will give a blue or black tint or florid appearance; preſſure upon the arteries is likely to produce paleneſs.</p>
            <p>DOCTOR HOSACK—Called again.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Q.</speaker>
               <p> Is there any way in which the teſtimony we have heard can be reconciled?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p> I think it may in either of two ways. Firſt, the ſpots might not have been, and I preſume were not as viſible at the time the body was firſt taken out of the water, as after it had been expoſed to the air for ſome days. This change of color in bruiſes is not uncommon in the living body, and I preſume ſome what ſimilar colors may occur by the proceſs of putrifaction after death. At firſt there may be very little change of color in the injured part, but, after ſome time, it undergoes a very conſiderable alteration. Secondly, it occurs to me, that as it was ſuppoſed that the neck and collar bone were broken, when ſhe was firſt taken out of the well, and as I did not ſee her until the day of interment, it is possible that the frequent turning and bending the head and, the frequent examination of the neck to aſcertain the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:038372_0078_1011D33C477DD8C0"/>
done to the collar bone, may have produced the appearances on the neck I before mentioned, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as the body had been dead for ſeveral days, and the veſſels had become tender; in which caſe, very little violence might have produced an effuſion of blood under the skin. Theſe circumſtances I did not advert to in my examination in the morning, not knowing the injury done to the neck and collar bone, which have been ſince related.</p>

               <speaker>Q.</speaker>
               <p> How much water will the lungs take in after death?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p> Only as much as the windpipe will hold can be received. The lungs collapſe at the laſt expira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a very inconſiderable quantity of water can be received afterwards. But this I do not aſſert from my own knowledge of the ſtate of the body after death by drowning, but upon the authority of Dr. Coleman, of London, who aſſerts that he frequently obſerved this fact upon diſſection.</p>
               <p>After the body has lain a long time under water, it is not unuſual to find water in it.</p>

               <p> I had lodged in the houſe only 5 or 6 days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the 22nd of December, but I thought he was more attentive to Hope than to Elma.</p>

               <p> I was once in company one evening, and Ring was there, and I heard ſomebody ſay if Levi Weeks ſhould get clear by law, it would not be ſafe for him
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:038372_0080_1011D342201CF280"/>
to appear in public, and Ring ſaid he thought ſo too.</p>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p> I heard Ring ſay that if he ſhould meet him in the dark, he ſhould not think it wrong to put him a' one ſide if he had a loaded piſtol, if he thought he ſhould not be found out on it. I went to the door pretty ſoon after, and Mr. Van Alſtine followed me. I told him I was really ſurpriſed that Ring ſhould expreſs himſelf in this manner, he ſaid he thought ſo too.</p>

               <p>—Laſt Friday morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a man, I don't know his name, came into my ſtore. <hi>(here one of the priſoner's counsel held a candle close to Croucher's face, who stood among the croud, and asked the witness if it was he, and be said it was.)</hi> he ſaid " Good morning gentlemen, Levi Weeks is taken up by the High Sheriff, and there is freſh evidence againſt him from Hackenſack.'—He then went away and as he went out he ſaid, " my name is Croucher;" and this was all the buſineſs he had with me.</p>

               <p>—I have been acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this Mr. Croucher for ſome time, but I never liked his looks. On the 2d of January, the day when the body was found, he was extremely buſy among the croud to ſpread improper inſinuations and prejudices againſt the priſoner, who was then taken; and among other things he told a ſtory about his loſing a pocket book. This conduct I thought unfair, and I told him ſo plainly. O but ſays he, there's the ſtory of the pocket book and ſtopped there.—He uſed to bring ſeveral articles of wearing apparrel, ſuch as ſhawls, &amp;c. to diſpoſe of, but I noticed that he always managed ſo as to come juſt at dinner time—I told my wife that I did not like the man, and deſired that ſhe would tell him, that in future if he wanted any thing of me, that I would call on him. Laſt Monday,
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:038372_0081_1011D345C9717718"/>
while I was buſy in my garden, he came again; now ſays he, the thing has all come out, the thing is ſettled, there is point blank proof come from the Jerſeys of a new fact. I told him I thought it wrong and highly improper that he ſhould perſecute Weeks in ſuch a manner when he had a difference with him; that for my own part, I wanted ſome further euidence before ſhould condemn the man.</p>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p> On Wedneſday after ſhe was miſſing, I was told that Levi was ſuſpected, and that it would be his ruin. I obſerved particularly after that, his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and behaviour; I could not ſee that there was the leaſt difference in either. He laid out the work of the ſhop as uſual. I inquired of my friends every day, and was told that things grew worſe and worſe, ſuſpicions roſe higher and I watched him cloſer, but I never diſcovered the leaſt alteration.</p>

               <p>On Sunday the 22d of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, my brother Levi came to my houſe about nine o'clock in the morning, I went to Church and left him there, I dined that day at my father-in law's, and did not return home till about 5 o'clock in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon. Juſt as we had drank tea and were yet ſitting at the table before we lit candles, my brother came in, and I believe in about half an hour afterwards Mr. and Mrs. M'Combs came in, and my brother tarried till about 8 o'clock, whether a little before or a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I cannot ſay. Mr. M'Combs and his wife ſat about 20 minutes as near as I can judge after my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther went out, I lighted them down ſtairs and held the candle to light them all the way to Mr. Rhinelander's corner, it being very ſlippery and dark cautioned them to take care. I came up again, juſt as I ſit down the candle, before I had time to ſit down myſelf Levi my brother came in to enquire about the buſineſs of the next day, as he had the charge of my ſhop, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the buſineſs as well as myſelf, and very attentive to it, I am ſeldom at the ſhop more than once a day. I attended to the buſineſs abroad, took dimenſions of work on my memorandum, and gave it to my brother in writing, his buſineſs was to give directions to the journeymen for execution—Here is eight doors on my memorandum, (producing it to the Court and Jury) of different dimenſions for Mr. James Cumming's houſe, which he took down that evening on a piece of paper as I called them off: he gave directions to the journeymen for their execution—the doors was made without any miſtake, fitted for their deſigned places, and without any further direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

from me. It was a general practice of my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's to call on me of an evening to conſult me about buſineſs of the next day, and if company happened to interfere, if he did not ſtay till the company was gone, he ſeldom failed to come in again before he went to bed. That night he came accordingly, he eat a hearty ſupper, he was as cheerful as ever I ſaw him, tarried till about 10 o'clock, and I ſuppoſe, went home as uſual.</p>

The diſtance by Broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and Barley-ſtreet is greater.

He ſaid he had no idea of attempting to queſtion the former deciſion of the court, but the cauſe had now aſſumed another complexion; it had now been made a point of defence, that the mind of the deceaſed was me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy and deranged—he thought the words as well as the look and behaviour of the deceaſed, ſhould be given in evidence, it being equally an index of the mind and diſpoſition, and that in his opinion, this was the only way to arrive at truth.</p>
            <p>Col. Burr was about to reply, but the Court told him it was unneceſſary: they ſaid the diſtinction taken by the Aſſiſtant Attorney General, was not ſuch as to induce them to change their opinion.</p>

            <p>HENRY CLEMENT—Gave Ring a good cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and he ſaid he was reſpected as far as he knew among the Friends, and he joined in giving Elma the character of a lively, cheerful diſpoſition.</p>

It is poſſible it might have been ſaid and I not hear it.</p>

            <p>Mrs. RING<hi>again.</hi>—Being asked if Elma was in the habit of being out of nights? She ſaid ſhe never was to my knowledge, never ſo as to alarm me; and as to his kindneſs to my children, I muſt contradict that, as to the reſt it may be true, for he ever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared of a tender diſpoſition.</p>

            <p>MARY SEARING, ANN FARREL, JACOB HOPPER, JEFFREY MEEKS.—Theſe witneſs all teſtified that they ſupped with Mrs. Brown on the occaſion of the birth-day of her ſon, and that Croucher was of the party, and that he came between 4 and 5 o'clock, and that he remained there till after 10, ſome of them ſaid after 11 o'clock.</p>
            <p>When queſtioned as to time, they could none of them remember exactly the day of the month, ſome ſaid it was after Chriſtmas, and ſome in the holy-days. They all agreed, however, that it was on a Sunday, and that it was the birth-day of Mrs. Brown's child.</p>

               <p>How many times was you at Ring's on Sunday evening of the 22d of December?</p>

               <p> No. I never did, nor do I know who did, I was at a Mrs. Wellham's, and I ſaw one there which I asked leave to bring it to Ring's, but I was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and that is all I know of them or ever ſaw of them.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>At 25 minutes paſt 2 o'clock, in the evening, the examination cloſed. Seventy-five witneſs having been ſworn.</p>
            <p>Col. Burr, read to the jury, the following paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:038372_0092_1011D36DEE9523F0"/>
from Hale's Plea of the Crown, v. II ,p. 289,290.</p>
            <p>In some cases presumptive evidences go far to prove a person guilty, tho' there be no express proof of the fact to be committed by him, but then it must be very warily pressed, for it is better five guilty persons should escape unpunished, than one innocent person should die.</p>
            <p>If a horse be stolen from A. And the same day B. be found up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, it is strong presumption that B. Stole him, yet I do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member before a very learned and wary judge in such an instance B. Was condemned and executed at Oxford assizes, and yet within two assizes after C. being apprehended for another robbery and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed, upon his judgement and execution, confessed he was the man that stole the horse, and being closely pursued desired B. a stranger to walk his horse for him, while he turned aside upon a necessary occasion, and escaped; and B. Was apprehended with the horse, and died innocently.</p>
            <p>Another that happened in my remembrance in stadfordshire where A. was long missing, and upon strong presumptions B. was supposed to have murdered him, and to have consumed him to ashes, in an oven, that he should not be found, whereupon B. was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted of murder, and convict and executed, and within one year after A. returned, being indeed sent beyond sea by B. against his will, and so, tho' B. justly deserved death, yet he really was not guilty of the offence for which he suffered.</p>
            <p>The counſel for the priſoner, now propoſed to ſubmit the cauſe to the charge of the Court—The Aſſiſtant Attorney-General wiſhed that the Court would adjourn, as they had done the preceding night; he ſtated that he had not ſlept ſince the morning that the cauſe was opened, and had then been without repoſe forty-four hours; that he found himſelf ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under this fatigue, and conſidering that the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner's counſel, who were to precede him would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably take ſeveral hours, it would be morning before he could begin his addreſs to the Jury—that really he had not ſtrength to proceed further that night, and ſhould therefore be under the neceſſity of aſcent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the propoſition of the other ſide, unleſs the Court would adjourn—He was anxious that the
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:038372_0093_1011D36F8BA7BFD8"/>
Court ſhould do this, becauſe he thought it import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant that the Jury ſhould hear obſervations on the teſtimony.</p>
            <p>The Court however, ſaid it would be too hard to keep the Jury together another night without the conveniencies neceſſary to repoſe, and they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not think it proper.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The CHIEF JUSTICE in charging the Jury observed,</hi> That from the manner in which the trial had been conducted, he had been led to ſuppose that the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of the counſel would have afforded him ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient time to adjuſt and arrange the maſs of evidence, which, in its progreſs, had been brought into view—that it had, unexpectedly, became his duty to charge them immediately after the teſtimony was cloſed—but that he ſubmitted to this with leſs reluctance from a perſuaſion that a minute detail was not eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to enable them to determine on the caſe accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its juſtice, as the evidence applying to the points on which it ought to be decided, in his opinion, lay in a ſmall compaſs—That the queſtion they had to decide involved conſiderations of great moment, both to the public and the priſoner—To the public as deeply intereſted in the detection and puniſhment of crimes of the atrocious nature of that with which the priſoner was charged—To the priſoner, as on their verdict depended his life and every thing dear to the human mind—That theſe obſervations were only pertinent ſo far as they might operate to ſtimulate their attention and prompt to a diſpaſſionate eſtimate of the evidence—but that they ought not to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to influence them from pronouncing the result of their inveſtigations according to the impreſſions they had made on their minds, regardleſs, of the conſequences attached to their determination—that
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:038372_0094_1011D37431FCA568"/>
their path of duty was clearly and diſtinctly traced for them <hi>to find the priſoner guilty if in their conſciences they believed</hi> him ſo <hi>from the evidence—to acquit him if they thought him innocent.</hi>—That previous to his conſidering the nature and effect of the evidence, it might be well to obſerve that this matter had, in a conſiderable degree, excited the public attention—that it had intereſted the paſſions of many, and that a variety of reports reſpecting it had been circulated, ſome of which muſt, unavoidably, have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to them—that by whatever motive prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they did not deſerve attention, and that they, ought not to have attached to them the leaſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, or to mingle with the facts diſcloſed by the witneſſes—that the obligation they had incurred when they became Jurors, limitted them to the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence produced on the trial, and that <hi>that</hi>only could juſtify the verdict they were called upon to give on this occaſion—that in the caſe it was not pretended that poſitive proof of the commiſſion of the murder by the priſoner was attainable, but that it had been attempted to prove his guilt by a circumſtantial evidence, and that if it could be eſtabliſhed by a number of circumſtances ſo connected as to produce a rational conviction that he was the perpetrator of the crime, it would be as much their duty to find him guilty, as if it was made out by direct and poſitive teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny—.that there were points in which the circumſtances attempted to be combined were not ſo ſatisfactorily connected as to enable them to pronounce the priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er guilty.—That it was doubtful whether Gulielma Sands left the houſe of Elias Ring in company with the priſoner ſo as to impoſe it on him to account for the manner in which he had diſpoſed of her—that the teſtimony reſpecting the one horſe ſleigh, did not appear to be ſuch as to juſtify a preſumption, that

the priſoner had perſonally any agency in them, for that if the relation of Suſannah Broad did not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy them, that the ſleigh was taken out of the lumber yard of the priſoner's brother at or about the time Gulielma Sands diſappeared, it muſt be evident that the relations of the other witneſſes reſpecting a ſleigh and the cries of diſtreſs heard near the Manhattan Well could have no application to the priſoner—that <hi>Mrs. Broad's</hi> teſtimony was confuſed as to the time, and indiſtinct and unſatisfactory as to circumſtances—that the priſoner appeared to be a young man—that it was fully proved that he had ſuſtained a fair character, and that he was of a mild diſpoſition—that it was difficult to diſcover what inducement could have actuated him in the commiſſion of the crime with which he was charged—that the declarations made by the priſoner after he became an object of ſuſpicion did not appear to be inconſiſtent with inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence—that the witneſſes produced on the part of the priſoner had accounted for the manner in which he ſpent the evening, excepting a few minutes—that from the account the medical gentlemen, who had been examined, had given of the ſtate of the Corpſe of Gulielma, ſoon after it was taken out of the Well, it was very doubtful whether ſhe had been expoſed to any other violence than that occaſioned by the drowning—that intimation had been given in the courſe of the trial, tending to queſtion the credibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſome of the witneſſes—but that it was not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to examine this point, for admitting all the circumſtances related by the witneſſes on the part of the proſecution to be ſtated without any diſpoſition to diſcolour them to the prejudice of the priſoner, the court were unanimouſly of opinion that the proof was inſufficient to warrant a verdict againſt him, and

that with this general charge they committed the priſoner's caſe to their conſideration.</p>
