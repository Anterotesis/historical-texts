            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

That he would uncrown himſelf to crown us, and put off his Robes to put on our Rags, and to come out of Heaven to keep us out of Hell? He faſted forty days, that he might feaſt us to all Eternity. He came from Heaven to Earth, that he might ſend us from Earth to Heaven.

O how earneſt was <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> with poor ſouls to come to him! <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt,</hi> Mat. 11.28.

                  <item>1. In his Forbearance and Long-ſufferance. O! how long hath Jeſus Chriſt born with the ſinful Nations, and yet he bears with them ſtill, notwithſtanding they have broke his Laws, and deſpiſed his Goſpel, and contemn his Ordinances, and ſhed his Saints blood, grieved his Spirit, and abuſed his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies: This and thus much they have done, and yet he ſpareth them that he might be gracious to them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.18. and therefore will the Lord wait, that he may be gracious to you. Therefore will he be exalted, that he may ſhew mercy. Now, <hi>Beloved,</hi> do you think that Jeſus Chriſt would take all this at the Nations hands, but that he is unwilling to deſtroy them, and moſt willing to ſave them?</item>
                  <item>2. His
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001244_0008_0FB1867C60D83018"/>Love appears not only by his bearing with them, but by his proffers to them. O <hi>Beloved,</hi> how doth God ſtand day after day, month af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter month, and year after year, proffering Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, his Son, his Mercies, his Love, his Grace and his Glory to poor ſouls? Many have the Space of Repentance, who have not the Grace of Repentance. Now, my Brethren, by theſe things you may ſee that Jeſus Chriſt hath a great deſire after the Nations.</item>
                  <item>3. Jeſus Chriſt is called <hi>the Deſire of all Nations,</hi> becauſe it is he only that can make any Perſon, or Family, or Nation, truly deſirable.</item>
               </list>
Oh, <hi>Beloved,</hi> what is the reaſon that the Lord of Hoſts prefers' his people before all the Sons of Men? The Lord prefers his little Remnant before all the World beſide; <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.5. <hi>You ſhall be a peculiar treaſure to me above all people. The Righteous is more excellent than his Neighbour, Proc.</hi> 12.26. Tho' his Neighbour be great, rich, honourable, yet if he be more Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, he is more excellent than he in Chriſt's eye. Believers be thoſe Worthies, <hi>of whom the world was not worthy,</hi> Heb. 11.35. <hi>Ye are a choſen generation, a royal priest-hood, an holy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a peculiar people,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.9.

            <p>Now what is the reaſon, Beloved, that the Saints are thus excellent above all others? is it for their birth, breeding, or learning, or rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, or greatneſs, or honour? No, no; it is for none of theſe: but if you will know the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it is becauſe Chriſt is formed in them, and married to them; they have the new Name,

You may go to Heaven without health, without wealth, without honours, without pleaſures, without friends, without learning; but you can never go to Heaven without Chriſt. What will you do, if you begin to die Naturally, before you begin to live Spiritually; if the tabernacle of Nature be taken down, before the Temple of Grace be raiſed up; if your Paradiſe be laid waſte, before the Tree of Life be ſet in it; if you give up the Ghoſt, before ever you receive the Holy Ghoſt; if the Sun of your Life be ſet within you before the Sun of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhine upon you; if the Body be fit to be turn'd into the Earth, before the Soul be fit to be taken into Heaven; if the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Birth have no place in you, the ſecond Death ſhall have a power over you? Tho' the Nations need nothing more than <hi>Chriſt,</hi> yet they ſlight nothing more than Chriſt. Tell me, how will you live when you die, that are dead whilſt you live? O Beloved! is it not ſad that the Nations ſhould reſiſt Chriſt, his Goſpel and Goverment as they do? Indeed if men might be their own Judges, then Chriſt had no Enemies, we are all his Friends. If the Jews might ſo have been their own Judges, it was not the Son of God whom they crucified, but an Enemy to <hi>Caeſar.</hi> It was not <hi>Paul</hi> a Saint that they

<pb n="62" facs="unknown:001244_0035_0FB186BFD2C32578"/>See a few <hi>Scriptures</hi> for this, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.3. <hi>All things were made by him.</hi> Mark, this is by Chriſt, all things were made by him, <hi>and without him was nothing made that was made,</hi> Col. 1.16. <hi>By him were all things created in heaven and earth, viſible and inviſible, all things were made by him and for him.</hi> So again, <hi>Joh</hi> 1.10. <hi>He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.</hi> Now Beloved, had Chriſt been leſs than God he could not have made Heaven and Earth, and therefore he is a God of Glory, the great God that now ſits upon the <hi>Throne;</hi> for he created the Heavens and the Earth, and all things therein.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That Chriſt is the true and perfect God, appears if you conſider the works and miracles which he did in the days of his fleſh; here is another unanſwerable Argument to prove the God-head of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>The winds and the Seas obey him, the Devil came out of the poſſeſſed, the blind received their ſight, the lame walked, the deaf heard, the dumb ſpake, le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers were cleanſed, the dead were raiſed, the ſick were healed.</hi> Oh, who could do this but God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as you may ſee, <hi>Mat</hi> 11.5. But you may ſay, the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did great <hi>Miracles,</hi> and yet were no Gods. Why, 'tis true; they did great <hi>Miracles,</hi> but in whoſe <hi>Name</hi> did they do it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and by whoſe power and ſtrength did they do't? was it in their own names, and by their own power? No, <hi>Beloved,</hi> they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves confeſs the contrary, <hi>Act.</hi> 12.13. they
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:001244_0035_0FB186BFD2C32578"/>tell you, <hi>It is not by their own power, but in the Name and power of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſo in <hi>Act.</hi> 4.10. <hi>We do it in the Name of Christ.</hi> So that, Beloved, this is a ſtrong Argument to prove the Deity of Chriſt; they did great Miracles in his Name, and by his power his Diſciples did great Miracles. And with this Chriſt ſatisfied the Diſciples of <hi>John, Go and tell what things you hear and ſee, how the lame walk, and the blind receive their ſight,</hi> go &amp; tell <hi>John.</hi> Now I ſay, theſe great things could be done by none but a great God; &amp; therefore Jeſus Chriſt is not only the Son of Man, but the Son of God, even the God bleſſed for ever.</p>
            <p>But 4ly, Conſider Divine Worſhip is due unto Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> now you know Worſhip is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per only to God, <hi>Worſhip him that made Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth and the Sea,</hi> ſaid the Angel, <hi>Re.</hi> 14.7. Worſhip only is proper to God alone. Now, Beloved, all the Acts of Worſhip that belong to <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father,</hi> are given to the <hi>Son</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, both Angels and men are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to <hi>worſhip him</hi> as well as we, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1 6. <hi>Let the Angels of God worſhip him,</hi> &amp; in <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.10. <hi>That at the Name of Jeſus every knee ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thirdly, If <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the <hi>Prince of Peace,</hi> be the cauſe and foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all our peace, why then, he that wants the <hi>Prince of Peace,</hi> wants all good things, he is the miſerableſt man in the world that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt, he wants reconciliation with God, and intereſt in Chriſt, he wants the ſealing and comforting of the Spirit, he wants Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Sanctification and Adoption; he wants pardon of ſin, and freedom from the domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſin; he wants that favour which is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than life, that joy which is unſpeakable &amp; full of glory, and that faith, a dram of which is more worth than a Kings ranſom: he wants thoſe riches which periſh not, that love which dies not, that Kingdom which ſhakes not. O Beloved, how many things doth that poor ſoul want, which wanteth.

               </gap>. Chriſt is a Pearl, and whoſoever hath him can never be poor, and whoſoever wants him can never be rich: did but men ſee all in this <hi>Pearl of Price,</hi> then they would ſell all for this <hi>Pearl of Price.</hi> Fourthly, If Jeſus Chriſt
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:001244_0049_0FB186DF9C6CD330"/>be the cauſe and foundation of our peace, then it is our greateſt concernment to get into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with this <hi>Prince of Peace, Many ſeek the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers favour,</hi> ſaith the Scripture.

Contemplation is a Glaſs to ſee our God in: 'Tis of greater concernment to know the eſtate of our Hearts, than to know the ſtate of the Kingdom. And therefore I beſeech you examine your ſelves, that you may know your ſelves, that you may know whoſe you are, while you live, and whither you ſhall go when you die, and what will become of you to all eternity.

Oh ſee, whether you be in the narrow way that leadeth to life, or in the broad way that leadeth to death; whether your hearts be chairs for vice to ſit in, or thrones for grace to rule us, whether you are one of Chriſt's Spo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="92" facs="unknown:001244_0049_0FB186DF9C6CD330"/>beaten path to perfection, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.26. <hi>Not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wiſe, not many mighty, not many noble are called.</hi> 'Tis not always ſeen that the ſparkling Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond of a great Eſtate, is ſet in the Gold-ring of a gracious Heart.

Oh how many thred-bare ſouls may there be found under ſilken-coats, and purple robes? they who live moſt downward, die moſt upward; a ſight of our ſelves in grace, will certainly bring us to a ſight of our ſelves in glory: thoſe ſins ſhall never make a hell for us, that be a hell to us.</p>

Jeſus Chriſt muſt needs be precious to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe he never diſpleaſed him in any thing, but pleaſed him in every thing, Joh. 8.29.

The Angels ſtand before him as Waiting-men to ſerve God, &amp; to ſerve ſuch as are God's; when he bids them go, they go; come, and they come; do this, and they do it; they do all his commands, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.20. Jeſus Chriſt is the Creator of Angels, the Lord of Angels, the Prince of Angels, the Head of Angels, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16. The Son of God is very precious to the Angels of God. Do you ſee, Sirs, how precious Chriſt is to the Angels of God; and well he may, for indeed he is the precious Jewel in the Cabinet of glory. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Jeſus Chriſt is precious to the Saints, as well as to the Father and Angels, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7. you have there a full Text to this purpoſe, <hi>Unto you therefore that believe he is precious:</hi> Mark here, <hi>unto you,</hi> what you? to you therefore which believe, he is precious: he is precious indeed to them that believe, and no wonder he is a Believer's All: now that which is his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> he is all that he enjoys; Chriſt is all that he is worth, he is all that they are; they are no ſuch thing without him, they are nothing without him; whatever they are worth, it is he that maketh them worth it; 'tis not worth a man's while <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>p five, unleſs he live in Chriſt; Chriſt is the gain of a Believer, living or dying; ſo that whatever is good for a Believer, he muſt ſay for this I am beholding to Chriſt, ſaith he, <hi>At things are yours, and ye are Chriſt's.</hi> Now Sirs, let me give you a little more particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Chriſtians worth, an Inventory of
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:001244_0055_0FB186EE60B5CB68"/>his Eſtate, and all along I ſhall ſhew you, that Chriſt is the worth of all that. What is it that maketh a Believer ſo precious and ſo excellent? Why 'tis ſuch things as theſe:
<list>
                  <item>1. He is a liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man.</item>
                  <item>2. He is a ſeeing man.</item>
                  <item>3. He is a Perſon of honour.</item>
                  <item>4. He hath a great deal of joy and hopes of more.</item>
                  <item>5. He is righteous and holy, and in a word, he is ſaved at laſt.</item>
               </list>
Theſe are the things that make a Chriſtian ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a perſon, and he hath none of thoſe but by Chriſt, and he hath all this alone by Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> This is the excellency of a Chriſtian, that he is a living man; there's no man on earth can in a ſpiritual ſence be called a liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man, but a Believer; all men be dead men, but they that believe. You know 'twas ſaid of the <hi>Prodigal,</hi> while he lived in his ſin, he was dead: <hi>This my ſon that was dead, &amp; is now alive.</hi> When he believed, then he was alive. Now, Sirs, as it is in the things of Nature, life is the moſt valuable thing which we have, <hi>skin for skin, and all that a man hath, will he give for his life;</hi> a man will rather part with his liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood than with his life, becauſe his life is ſo dear to him. Now, Beloved, if natural life be ſo deſirable a thing, what is ſpiritual life, that which is Scripture is call'd <hi>the life of God?</hi> Now the Believer is the only living man, every o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man is ſpiritually dead: but now how comes the Believer to live? by whom doth he live? why, <hi>'Tis Christ Jeſus,</hi> Gal. 2.20. <hi>I am crucified with Chriſt, notwithstanding I live:</hi> What crucified, and yet live? Yes, Chriſt was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and yet lives: and ſo did <hi>Paul</hi> in a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance and conformity to Chriſt, <hi>I live,</hi> ſays
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:001244_0056_0FB186F4CCBFB7B8"/>he, <hi>yet not I, but Chriſt which lives in me; and the life which I now live in the fleſh, I live by the faith of the Son of God.</hi> So that <hi>Paul</hi> will not call his life his own, but only as he deriveth it from Chriſt, Chriſt lived in him more than he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf lived.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The excellency of a Believer lies in this, That he is a ſeeing man: 'tis ſight which puts the difference between perſon and perſon; it is a ſad thing to be born blind, or to be blind after a man is born. Now a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Another Wonder in Chriſt's Humiliation is this, he ſuffered in his ſoul, Mat. 26.38. <hi>My ſoul is exceeding ſorrowful even unto death,</hi> ſaith Chriſt. Oh what a word was this for a God to ſpeak, to ſay, <hi>My ſoul is exceeding ſorrowful, even unto death;</hi> for man to ſay ſo, is no great wonder; but for a God to ſay ſo, Oh this is a great wonder indeed: the ſufferings of his ſoul was the ſoul of his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. Chriſt yielded his ſoul for our ſouls, his ſoul in our ſouls ſtead. Many of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servants have ſuffered much in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as the Martyrs that were rack'd, &amp; burnt, and ſawn aſunder, but they had much freedom in their ſouls, their ſouls were full of much ſpiritual joy and comfort: but now Jeſus Chriſt did not only ſuffer in his body, but in his ſoul; and this is that which makes the wonder the greater, that Chriſt ſuffered in his ſoul, he drank the Cup of Affliction, that we might drink the Cup of Conſolation; he taſted Death for us, that we might taſte Life for him: Chriſt was forſaken, that we might never be forſaken.</p>

The laſt great wonder that I ſhall mention, is this, Chriſt foreſaw all this, and yet he willingly undertook it to ſave mankind; Chriſt knew before he come from Heaven, how his Country-men the <hi>Jews</hi> would uſe him, and that one of his Family would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray him, <hi>Job.</hi> 6.4. ſays the.

O this is a great wonder, dear Chriſtians, methinks ſuch a Pearl ſhould ſparkle in our eyes: we ſail O Glory, not in the ſalt Sea of our Tears, but in the Red Sea of Chriſt's Blood. Truly it is wonderful to think how much <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> did for us, and how little do we for him; the greater his ſufferings were, the greater were our ſins; the greater his pain was, the greater ſhould be our love to him again. I ſhall make of this point, a Uſe of Information and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation.</p>

               <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. Firſt, Is it ſo that a Believer's Saviour is a wonderful Saviour? then it informs us of eight things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. My firſt Inference is this, that Chriſt's ſufferings were great ſufferings, in what he endured from men in his body, and in what he ſuffered from God in his ſoul. Chriſt did not only endure pain in his body, but a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in his ſoul. On the Sea of Sufferings the Sea of Sorrow, the Sea of Blood, the Sea of Tears that our Bleſſed Saviour waded through to come and bring peace to our ſouls, ſalvation to our ſouls, grace and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:001244_0071_0FB18711A2A07C98"/>to our ſouls. He ſuffered from God, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo from men his enemies, he ſuffered from men his friends, he ſuffered from Devils, he ſuffered in his Name, he ſuffered in his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, he ſuffered in his Body, he ſuffered in his Soul; the cauſe was our ſins, the effect our ſalvation. If you look through the Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle of his life, you ſhall find his whole life full of ſorrow and miſery: <hi>He was perſecuted, he was tempted, he was repreached, he was falſly accuſed, he was apprehended, he was betrayed, he was crucified:</hi> what ſhall we ſay more? what can be ſaid more? He was ſo full of ſorrow, he took his Name from ſorrow; our Lord Jeſus Chriſt is called <hi>a man of ſorrows,</hi> Iſa. 53.3. <hi>A man of ſorrows, and acquainted with grief</hi> Now judge, <hi>Sirs,</hi> whether Chriſt's life was not full of ſorrows; he took his Name from ſorrow. O ſweet Jeſus, thy ſufferings were great ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings: that's my firſt Inference.</item>
               <item>2. Jeſus Chriſt ſuffered by himſelf, but not for himſelf; he was alone in his ſufferings, neither Angles nor Saints bore any part with Chriſt in his ſufferings; no, he drank the bitter cup alone, <hi>He alone purged our ſins,</hi> Heb. 1.3. <hi>He alone by himſelf,</hi> ſays the Text, <hi>purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that, my Brethren, all that our Lord Jeſus ſuffered, it was not for himſelf, but it was for us; our bleſſed Saviour ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for us, that we might not ſuffer. This is the ſecond Inference.</item>
               <item>3. My third is this, That it is more for Chriſt to ſuffer any thing, than for all Men and Angles to ſuffer all things. Pray mark <hi>Sirs,</hi> if all the Kings and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

<pb n="137" facs="unknown:001244_0072_0FB187132522B2D8"/>hardly, and die ſhamefully, why all this had not been ſo much as for Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God to have ſuffered the leaſt thing he did ſuffer Nay further, I ſay, If all the Angels in Heaven, and Men on Earth, had come and ſuffered, and died ten thouſand deaths, it had not been ſo much, put all together; as it was for Chriſt to ſuffer any thing; becauſe they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>re Creatures, he the Creator; they are Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, he the Maſter; they are Subjects, he the Prince; they are mean, he is Mighty; <hi>He is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords; he thought it no robbery to be equal with God,</hi> Phil. 2.6. Now I ſay, it would not have been half ſuch a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if all the Angels in Heaven, and Men on Earth, had come and ſuffered, as it was for the Son of God. Oh this is a wonder of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, his ſufferings were wonderful, his humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity was wonderful, his patience was wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, his love was wonderful, greater love could none ſhew; he loved us ſo that he died for love. Now I beſeech you conſider this Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, which was this, <hi>That it is more for Jeſus Chriſt to ſuffer any thing, than for all M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

You may keep your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to your ſelves, if you do not give your hearts to him. A duty that is heareleſs, is a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that is fruitleſs. You can never give God the heart of your ſervice, if you do not give him your heart in your ſervice. The heart ſhould be the firſt that comes into duty, and the laſt that goes out of duty. Good words without the heart are but flattery, and good works without the heart are but hypocriſie. Beloved, for your poor ſouls ſake, let words &amp; works go together, your tongue, and hearts go together, your lips and lives go together, your prayers and practice go together. If your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties do not eat out the heart of your ſins, your ſins will eat out the heart of your duties. A dram of matter is better than a flood of words. A heart without words, is better than words without a heart. A little done with the heart, is better than a great deal done without the heart. Nothing takes with the heart of God, but what is done with the hearts of men. He that regards the heart without any thing, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards not any thing without the Heart.

Take away ſpiritual breathings, and you take away ſpiritual living. We may pray alway, and yet not be always at prayer. Chriſtians can never want a praying time, if they do not want a praying frame. None can pray aright but thoſe that are new creatures, but all ought to pray, becauſe they are creatures: a ſpiritual man may pray carnally, but a carnal man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pray ſpiritually. Prayer fetched as Angel out of Heaven to fetch <hi>Peter</hi> out of Priſon; they prayed heartily, and they ſped happily.

If ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation were eaſie to come by, it would be ſlightly ſet by. There is no obtaining of what is promiſed, but by fulfilling what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. The neglecting of the race of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, will be the obſtructing of the price of happineſs. <hi>Follow peace with all men, and holineſs, without which none ſhall ſee God, Heb.</hi> 12.14. Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, there are many young people in the World, who are very wicked in the World, they walk in darkneſs, and do the works of darkneſs; they are young in years, but old in ſin; they are very vain in a vain World, they ſit with delight, and make ſit their delight. I beſeech you look in Eccl. 11 9. <hi>Rejoyce O young man in thy youth, and let thy heart chear thee, and walk in the ways of thine own heart.</hi> O this is brave indeed, if it would always laſt; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the flaſh of Lightnings, comes the clap of Thundering; mark what follows, <hi>Bot know for
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:001244_0099_0FB18764ED102DB8"/>all theſe things God will bring thee to Judgment.</hi> Do but you ſee here, Sirs, O were it not for this <hi>But,</hi> how brave were it for wicked men! But know for all theſe things God will bring thee to Judgment; for all thy wantonneſs, for all thy pride, for all thy prophaneneſs &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality, thou ſhalt be brought to Judgment. After all your preſent receiving, you muſt be brought to your future reckoning. O there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let nothing be done in this World, which cannot be anſwered in another World. Let me beſeech you, who are young men &amp; young women, <hi>To remember your Creator in the dayes of your Youth:</hi> To ſerve God, to love God, to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God, to obey God in your youthful days. The flower of Life is of Chriſt's ſetting, and ſhall it be of the Devil's plucking? will you hang the moſt ſparkling Jewel of your young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er years in the Devil's ear? O it is hard <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If God's to day be too ſoon for thy repentance, thy to morrow will be too late for his acceptance. You can never come too ſoon to God, nor ſtay too long with God. He ſhall be happy in the end, who is holy to the end: <hi>Be thou faithful to the death, and I will give thee a crown of life,</hi> Rev. 2.2. O hold on, and hold our to the end.

The Spirit of God is able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the Word of God, and to make it plain to our underſtanding. The Holy Ghoſt is the Churches Interpreter; He gives the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> &amp; he can reveal unto us the ſence and meaning of the Scripture. The Word is Gods Counſellor, to diſcover the path in <hi>which</hi> we are to walk; the Spirit is the Counſel of God, that teacheth us how to walk in that path.

Jeſus Chriſt that lies in the boſom of his Father, he unboſoms, and unbowels the heart of the Father to Believers; they know his Secrets, his Mind, his Counſel, and his Will, and none knoweth it but them; <hi>I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, becauſe thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes,</hi> Mat. 11.25.

The young Lyons do lack and ſuffer hunger, but they that ſeek the Lord ſhall not want any good thing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.9, 10.

My ſheep hear my voice, and they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me, and I gave unto them eternal life, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.28.</q> The Saints have the ſame glory which Chriſt himſelf hath; the Saints in Heaven are not only glorified with Chriſt (which is a great

The Head and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are glorifi'd together with the ſame kind of glory: God hath not one Heaven for his Son and another for his Saints, but one and the ſame for both. Believers ſhall be as truly glorious as Chriſt is, and eternally glorious as he is. <q>Our vile bodies ſhall be faſhioned like unto his glorious body, and we ſhall be glorified toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with him, and appear with him in glory, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.</q> Oh here is the excellency of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Lamb; they that follow him, ſhare with him.</p>
            <p>The ſixth Excellency of following the Lamb is, They that follow the Lamb, ſhall be prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the Lamb: <q>He ſuffered no man to do them wrong; yea, he reproved Kings for their ſakes, ſaying, Touch not mine Anointed, and do my Prophets no harm, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 105.14, 15. <hi>which are his Saints.</hi> Who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good? And if ye ſuffer for righteouſneſs ſake, happy are ye; and be not afraid of their terrour, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be troubled, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.13.</q> 
               <q>Fear them not, for I am with thee: be not diſmayed, for I am thy God: yea, I will ſtrengthen thee; yea, I will help thee, yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of <hi>my</hi> righteouſneſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.10. Can a <hi>woman</hi> forget her ſucking child, that ſhe <hi>ſhould not</hi> have compaſſion on the ſon of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will not I forget thee, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.15.</q> Who can harm a man, if God be with him and for him?

God protects men in his way, but not out of his way; when men ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear for God, God appears for men; he is good to them in affliction, and he doth them good by affliction.</p>
            <p>The ſeventh Excellency is, They that follow the Lamb, ſhall not feel the wrath of the <hi>Lamb:</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Firſt in the opening of it, there are three things to be explained:

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Beloved,</hi> they are ſix:

                  <item>2. The Barr of Unbelief:</item>

            <p>Theſe <hi>(my Beloved)</hi> are the curſed Barrs
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:001244_0142_0FB1862AACCC8D38"/>which barr God and Chriſt, and the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit out of the Heart.</p>
            <p>I ſhall begin firſt with the <hi>Barr of Ignorance,</hi> and in that I ſhall ſhew you theſe <hi>three things:</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>1. What <hi>Ignorance</hi> is:</item>
                  <item>2. What <hi>Sinners</hi> are ignorant of:</item>
                  <item>3. The <hi>miſchievouſneſs</hi> of this <hi>Sin of Ignorance.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>And firſt, What Ignorance is: Ignorance is the want of knowledge, or darkneſs of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; for ſo ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> Eph. 4.18. <hi>Having the underſtanding darkned, being alienated from the life of God, thro' the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance that is in them, becauſe of the blindneſs of their heart.</hi> Here you may ſee what Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is; the Apoſtle calls it darkneſs and blindneſs: So likewiſe in 2 Cor. 3.4. <hi>But if our goſpel be hid, it is hid to them that are loſt, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them, which believe not, leſt the light of the glorious goſpel of Chriſt who is the image of God, ſhould ſhine unto them.</hi> So that Ignorance is darkneſs of mind, blindneſs of heart, and want of knowledge and ſpiritual underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Soul.</p>
            <p>Secondly, What are Sinners ignorant of?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer</hi> 1. They are ignorant of God, they are ignorant of Chriſt, they are ignorant of the Spirit, they are ignorant of the Word, they are ignorant of their own Miſery, they are ignorant of the neceſſity of a Change, of being born again, of being new <hi>Creatures,</hi> of being converted and turned from darkneſs to light, from death to life, and from the power
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:001244_0143_0FB1862C2575D800"/>of Satan to the living God; ſuch things as theſe, I ſay, they are ignorant of; and this is that which keeps poor ſouls from going to Chriſt. O Beloved! we have many of thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, who are thus ignorant. It was ſaid of the Prieſts the Sons of <hi>Eli,</hi> that they were Sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> and knew not the Lord, 1 <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>.</hi> 2.8. So in the Propheſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. It is ſaid, the Prieſts ſaid not, where is the Lord? and they that handle the Law, know me not. So the Phariſees were blind leaders of the blind, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.14. Would to God there were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>oſ.</hi> 4.1. Becauſe there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land; by ſwearing, and lying, and killing, and ſtealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood; therefore the land mourneth, and my people are deſtroyed for lack of knowledge; becauſe thou haſt rejected knowledge, I will alſo reject thee; ſeeing thou haſt forgotten the law of thy God, I will alſo forget thy children: they eat up the ſins of my people, and ſet their hearts on their iniquity. Thus men err, not knowing the Scriptures, <hi>nor the power of God,</hi> Mat. 22.29.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Miſchievouſneſs of this Sin of Ignorance.
<list>
                  <item>1. Ignorance is that which keeps men from knowing of God:</item>
                  <item>2. Ignorance is that which keeps men from pleaſing God:</item>
                  <item>3. Ignorance is that which keeps men from coming to God:</item>
                  <item>4. Ignorance hinders men from having a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in God:</item>
                  <item>5. Ignorance is that which har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens

               </list>
O curſed &amp; miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous Ignorance! What ſin like unto this? This is that which darkens, which hardens, which blinds and barrs the door of Sinners hearts againſt Chriſt. O that thou hadſt known (ſaith our dear Lord) the things that belong to thy peace, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19 42. But becauſe they are a people of no underſtanding; therefore he that made them, will have no mercy on them: &amp; he that formed them, will ſhew them no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.11. Thus (my Beloved) I have ſhewed you what a wretched and miſerable ſtate ſuch are in, that are thus ignorant.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The ſecond Bar is Unbelief, which bars and bolts Chriſt out of the Heart: this is that which makes men.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That they give no credit to the report of the Goſpel. 2.

            <p>O Friends! how much doth it concern you and me, to examine our ſtanding, that we may be able to ſtand in the day of Gods Wrath, which is coming ſo faſt upon us. O you ſee how that his Wrath is but a little kindled, &amp; yet how hard a matter is it for men to ſtand, &amp; to abide it; Thouſands have been ſent to their Graves by it, and many hundreds have left their Habitations, becauſe of it, and are fled out of the City, into ſeveral parts of this Kingdom for refuge. O what a ſad and doleful place hath this City been for ſeveral weeks paſt! The greateſt Trade which bath been here amongſt us, was to bury the dead, and tend the ſick. O now my Brethren, if this little be ſo much, what will it be when the great day of his wrath is come! Who will then be able to ſtand? O therefore examine your ſelves, &amp; try your faith, examine your faith, whether it be true; your knowledge, whether it be ſanctified; your hope, whether it be purified; your love, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be ſincere; your evidences, whether they be ſound; your hearts, whether they be gracious; your deſires, whether they be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; your ends, whether they be right; &amp; your converſations, whether they be heavenly, that you may be able to ſtand in the day of Wrath, in the day of Death, and in the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5.</p>

               <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. By way of Exhortation. And I ſhall be brief, leſt I ſhould intrude too much upon your patience; but I hope you will not think the time long, for it may be the laſt Sermon that I may preach, or you hear. Well (Belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) is it ſo, that the greateſt part of men and women will not be able to ſtand in the day of God's wrath? Give me leave therefore to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort you to theſe three things:
<list>
                  <item>1. You that are Sinners, to repent of your ſins; <hi>For he that confeſſeth and forſaketh, ſhall have mercy,</hi> Prov. 28.13. He that covereth his ſins ſhall not proſper; but he that confeſſeth &amp; forſaketh them ſhall have mercy. Happy is the man that feareth alway; but he that hardneth his heart, ſhall fall into miſchief. O ſinners, you have grievouſly ſinned againſt God, you have deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as many Hells, as you have committed Sins; you have ſinned againſt his Mercies, you have abuſed his Patience, you have reſiſted his Spir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t, you have not obeyed his Goſpel, you have made light of his Miniſters, &amp; you have hated his Members. O ſinners, all this have you done, and yet the Lord hath ſpared you; and though you have ſinned at ſo high a rate, yet God hath given you ſpace to repent: O let his goodneſs lead you to repentance, that you die not in your ſins. O therefore, for God's ſake, and Chriſt's ſake, be ye prevailed withal; why will you die, ſeeing God would have you live? why will you damn your ſelves? why will you go to Hell, ſeeing God would have you go to Heaven? O do but ſee what the Lord ſaith, <hi>Iſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

O ſinners! if you will but come to Chriſt, you ſhall be reconciled to the Father, juſtified by the Son, you ſhall be ſanctified by the Spirit, you ſhall be delivered from Wrath, you ſhall be made the Children of God, you ſhall have your Names enrolled in the Book of Life: &amp; finally, you ſhall be received into everlaſting Glory at the end of your days. O therefore let this prevail with you to go to Chriſt for Light, for Life, for Grace, for Strength, &amp; for Comfort and Peace, that <hi>of his fulneſs you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive grace for grace, Joh.</hi> 1.16.</item>
                  <item>3. And laſtly, Let me now exhort you (who are dead to ſin, ſeparated from the world, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſed to Chriſt, reconciled to the Father) to <hi>walk worthy of God, who hath called you to his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and glory,</hi> 1 Theſ. 2.12.

There ſeems to be four Reaſons why God ſwept away the Righteous with the Wicked by <hi>the Peſtilence.</hi>

For the trial of his peoples Fear; as in that of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> Gen. 22.12. <hi>For now I know that thou fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est God, ſeeing thou haſt not wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

God tempts for the trial of their Faith, he proves them in ſomething that's near and dear to them: perhaps deprives them of ſome ſpecial neceſſary Mercy, to ſee whether they can truſt him, and believe in the want of it; whether they can live by Faith upon the God of Mercies, when the Mercies are gone, as it is written, <hi>The juſt ſhall live by faith.</hi> Heb. 2. 4.

<pb n="328" facs="unknown:001244_0168_0FB186570B1514F8"/>was tried, he offered up Iſaac,</hi> Heb. 11.17.3. Again thirdly, the Lord tempts for the proof of their Obedience: and thus the Lord ſpeaks to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> after that trial: <hi>And in thy ſeed</hi> ſhall <hi>all the nations of the earth be bleſſed?</hi> Why? <hi>becauſe thou hoſt they'd my voice.</hi> In all this the Lord ſeeth what is in our hearts, as he ſaid to <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8 2.2. We may find Man tempting God too, that is, provoking God to jealouſie and wrath; this did the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> at the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Meribah,</hi> Deut 6.19. <hi>Ye</hi> ſhall <hi>not tempt the Lord thy God,</hi> Exod. 17.2. <hi>Wherefore do ye tempt the Lord?</hi> But firſt of all, we tempt God when we doubt of his Power; as when we are in any ſtreight or difficulty, we miſtruſt the Power of God to deliver us, or beſtow any Mercy upon us which we ſtand in need of; as that Lord did, on whoſe hand the King leaned, who ſaid, <hi>If the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We tempt God when we doubt of his Mercy, for God is Mercy in the abſtract, and it is a part of his glorious Style; therefore he cannot endure to loſe ſo great a part of his Honour, but is provoked by it. 3. When we call his Faithfulneſs in queſtion: What greater diſparagement or more diſgraceful thing can there be to a man, than to be wrongfully accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for falſifying his word? Then how much greater provocation is it to the great God, to be impeached for breach of promiſe; &amp; counted unfuthful who cannot lie, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.18. Laſtly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When we murmur at the hand of God at any of his Judgments; thus <hi>Iſrael</hi> did at <hi>Meribah,</hi> Exod.
<pb n="329" facs="unknown:001244_0168_0FB186570B1514F8"/>17.2, 3. &amp; this doth exceedingly inflame and excite the wrath of God: we cannot diſpoſe for our ſelves, and yet we are angry at the Providence of an All-wiſe God: we ſin, &amp; are not troubled that God corrects us for ſin. 3.

<list>
                  <item>1. By repreſenting ſome ſinful object: It is not good to nouriſh ſuch Conceptions, but ſtrangle them in their firſt appearance, elſe ſinful Thoughts grow upon us.</item>
                  <item>2. By preſenting ſome deſirableneſs in the object; but be quick-ſighted; ſin, however it ſeems fair under ſome colourable pretext, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, upon good deliberation, not at all to be deſired; but ſometimes it comes cloathed in ſuch a glorious garb, as if it meant no harm, that you muſt be fain to fly to God by Prayer againſt this Temptation.</item>
                  <item>3. There's a perſwaſion to conſent to the Sin; but be not eaſily perſwaded to offend your Father; Oh! how will our Luſts gain upon us, if we do not reſiſt? ſtrive with all your might; the greater your allurements to ſin is, the greater the ſin is. I appeal to Saints expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</item>
                  <item>4. In the fourth and laſt place, We have the Devil tempting Man; he is called <hi>the Tempter,</hi> Mat. 4.1, 3. Mar. 1.13. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this is the grand Tempter, that makes
<pb n="330" facs="unknown:001244_0169_0FB1865860419180"/>uſe of our Luſts as a ſubſervient Organ or Inſtrument for his Temptations againſt the Soul; and indeed, were it not for our Luſts, it would be in vain for Satan to tempt: As we ſee in Chriſt, there was nothing within for Satan to take hold of, Chriſt being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſinful Luſts; but Satan muſt come by word of mouth to tempt him, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.1, 3. But here it might be enquir'd, <hi>How ſhall I know when Satan raiſed the Temptation.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. I anſwer, firſt, When it comes ſtrongly and forcibly upon the ſoul, as it were, with a double power, even overthrowing the ſoul (almoſt) at the firſt Encounter. There's a double ſtrength in the ſtroke. 2. When it is of long continuance, as that was which <hi>Paul beſought the Lord twice for,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8. Satan ſtirs up the heart afreſh, and the luſts of the heart! When the fire is ready to die and go out, he blows it up again, adds life &amp; ſtrength to the Temptation, which elſe could not laſt long. The Luſts they are the combuſtible Matter, and Satan he inflames and ſets them on fire. 3. The Temptation when, though it may be weak at firſt, yet at length, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, it grows ſtronger and ſtronger. Satan begins to reaſon with, and perſwade the ſoul by plauſible arguments. 4. We may perceive the working of the Serpent, the Devil: when the temptation is full of wiles. &amp; ſubtil delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, <hi>Eph.</hi> 16.11.2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.24. The more intricate &amp; full of ſubtilty the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, the more cauſe there is to ſuſpect. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
<pb n="331" facs="unknown:001244_0169_0FB1865860419180"/>is very buſie for the enſnaring of the Soul.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Laſtly, The more it is in direct oppoſition to God in his Commands, or the like, we may be the more ſure it is of Satan's framing; for the heart, and its luſts, ſeek for ſatisfaction, &amp; then are ſtill, (if Satan joi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> not) tho' God be not ſo directly oppoſite: But the Devil ſtrikes always at God in his temptations; or if not always, yet moſt frequently.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the Tempter; now for the Temptation it ſelf There are ſeveral ſorts of temptations; but to reduce them all to theſe three Heads, they do concern, and ſtrike at. <hi>Firſt</hi> of all, God; this being Satans great aim, to oppoſe God; as two enemies, always in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect oppoſition to one another; and thus he tempts either: 1. As to the Being of God, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in queſtion the very truth of the Eſſence of the great God, cauſing the ſoul to doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be a God or no, like <hi>Pharaoh, Who is the Lord,</hi> &amp;c <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.5.</p>
            <p>But <hi>ſecondly,</hi> Some Temptations touch upon the nature of God, as to the manner of his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Myſtery of three diſtinct Perſons, as to their Offices &amp; Operations, in the individual God-head, God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Spirit; and yet all but one God bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for ever. Again, As to thoſe Divine inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Attributes of God,</hi> his independency, puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, immutability, greatneſs and eternity; his goodneſs, grace, mercy, love, patience, &amp; juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice. I ſay, ſometimes as doubting of theſe things is our temptation; yea, &amp; could Satan prevail, we ſhould flatly deny his Being, Nature, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties &amp; all. Look ſternly on, &amp; reſiſt ſtrongly
<pb n="332" facs="unknown:001244_0170_0FB1865B5E27BDE8"/>ſuch Temptations as theſe, which do immediately &amp; preſumptuouſly intrench upon God's Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign &amp; Juſt Prerogative. And, if I miſtake not, a great device of Satan's in this ſtratagem, is, to perſwade the Creature from all dependency up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Creator, that ſo being left to her ſelf, and ſtanding upon its own ſtrength, he may more deſtroy it. For what's the Creature without the Creator's power?</p>
            <p>Again, ſome Temptations touch our Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Being. Such as are an evil heart of unbelief, miſtruſting the grace of God, deſpairing of the goodneſs of our Condition. Satan would fain raze the very Fountain of Spiritual Exiſtence, Adoption, Juſtification, &amp; hopes of Salvation; it is his great deſign to ſhake the very ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work of this Building, &amp; to perſwade, that all's falſe. But this temptation is fruitleſs, when we build aright upon a <hi>right foundation,</hi> by Faith accompanied with repentance from dead works, upon <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> as the <hi>alone Author</hi> &amp; <hi>Meritorious Cauſe</hi> of our <hi>Justification</hi> &amp; <hi>Eternal Clarification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Laſtly, Satan by his fiery Darts ſtrikes at our well-being to diſturb our Peace by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſome <hi>Duty,</hi> or <hi>commiſſion</hi> of ſome <hi>Sin;</hi> when he finds he cannot prevail to deſtroy out <hi>being,</hi> then he would deprive us of <hi>well-being,</hi> our <hi>joy</hi> &amp; <hi>comfort.</hi> But know, tho' theſe Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations may trouble us, yet ſhall they never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy us. Now for the manner of theſe Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, how they work.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When we fall under any want, ſtrait, change of Providence, or the like; then is a time for temptation to work; as when Chriſt had faſted &amp; was an hungred, then comes the
<pb n="333" facs="unknown:001244_0170_0FB1865B5E27BDE8"/>Tempter, <hi>If thou be the Son of God, command that theſe ſtones may be made bread,</hi> Mat. 4.3.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When we are firſt turning from ſin to God, then we are ſure to meet with a <hi>Tempter,</hi> Satan will be buſie.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When we are troubled, dejected, diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolated, either to the outward or inward eſtate, then beware of Satan's temptation, he will be furthering our diſquietments.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When we are arrived to ſome good hopes, thro' Grace, to ſome Confidence in the Mercy of God the Father, thro' his Son Jeſus Chriſt; then alſo ſhall we find the battering Aſſaults of Satan to ſhake our Confidence: but be ſure al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, that the grounds of your Confidence be good, eſtabliſhed upon that Everlaſting Rock, Jeſus Chriſt. For, if I miſtake not in my obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, there are two great Rocks, which Satan ſtrives to ſplit a Soul upon, <hi>Preſumption</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair:</hi> Sometimes endeavouring to cauſe Souls to flatter up themſelves, &amp; think Grace is theirs, Chriſt is theirs, and all is theirs, when it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo, but by this he might carry them blind to Hell, hood-winking their Souls ſo, that they never come to ſee throughly, that they are in a bad condition, but think always their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion good. The other Rock is <hi>Deſpair;</hi> Satan ſtriving, if he cannot blind them, as he doth the other preſumptuous Souls, yet to make them go ſorrowing all their days, thinking they ſhall never obtain that Mercy which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers think they always had.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Satan ſuits his Temptations to our Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions; he hath various Objects for divers Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; for the proud haughty Soul, for the luſtful
<pb n="334" facs="unknown:001244_0171_0FB1865C2E938DB0"/>Heart, for the covetous Worldling, for the Prodigal Son, for the raſh giddy Brain, for the ſluggiſh Drone, for the melancholly Perſon, for the light chearful Spirit; eſpecially theſe two, either ſinking the one in the terrible Waves of black and dreadful Thoughts, or toſſing and liſting up the other with the Wind of fooliſh Fancy. Oh! what black Apprehenſions ſhall the one have of it ſelf &amp; God? and what light and ſlight Thoughts the other, of the preſent State, and of Eternity.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Satan aims to lull the Soul aſleep in carnal ſecurity: And to this end, preſents great ſins as ſmall, &amp; little ſins, (if any there be) as none at all: But ſometimes he will add by temptation, as it were a multiplying-glaſs, to the ſoul, ſo that then every ſin looks with a ghaſtly countenance, is thought to be the ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Holy Spirit, an unpardonable Sin.</p>
            <p>Having thus ſhewn how, and upon what oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion Satan works; I ſhall take occaſion to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, why they have ſo much power, as many times to prevail.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe of the Tempters Power, he is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps too ſtrong for the ſoul.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe of the Tempters Policy; if he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prevail by open force, the ſoul being well &amp; ſtrongly grounded; then he invades by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til devices, &amp; ſecret ſtratagems, ſo that the ſoul cannot eſcape by ſtrength only; and therefore (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>wanting wiſdom to evade his cunningly fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Arguments) is baffled by him, &amp; overthrown.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The enticing Nature of the Tempter's Baits; As, to inſtance in one caſe, Oh how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny poor ſincere ſouls, yet guilty of too much
<pb n="335" facs="unknown:001244_0171_0FB1865C2E938DB0"/>curioſity, have been intangled by curiouſly glorious, &amp; gloriouſly curious Tenets, which were no better than the deviliſh temptation of that Helliſh Tempter! How many, (which yet is ſtrange to think, tho' there is no reaſon to fear it) nay, after their ſeemingly comfortable, really, comfortleſs, wandring walkings in thought-ways of truth, have cauſe to fit down, &amp; ſet down their ſteps, marking for every ſtep a ſin; &amp; for every ſin, letting fall a tear of blood.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Temptations often prevail by reaſon of the ſtrength of Corruptions, which the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter works upon. Were there no Corruptions, there would be few or no Temptations; I am ſure, they ſhould not prevail.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Laſtly, The Tempter's prevalency pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the weakneſs and low eſtate of the inward man: Sin is never at a higher flood, than when Grace is at a low ebb: It is a hard matter (believe Experience) to keep the Soul from ſinking at ſuch a time. Nothing more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie than to thruſt one under water, when the depth of the water is more than the heighth of the man.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>But now to make ſure the Doctrinal part, I ſhall lay down ſome Reaſons, why the People of God are thus attended with Temptations: for it is a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Objection againſt this Point, Why will the Lord, who is ſo mere. ful of his People, ſuffer them to be thus uſed and buffeted by Temptation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer in general, on Gods behalf, that he is never the leſs tender in it, as will appear in particular, thus:

                  <item>2. Again, It is for a Saint's Exerciſe: This Tempted Condition, is God's Artillery, his School of Arms, wherein God brings up his Children, trains them, &amp; inſtructs them how to claſp on their Helmet of Salvation, to put on the Breaſt plate of Righteouſneſs, to hold out the ſhield of Faith, to brandiſh the Sword of the Spirit: In a word, how to put on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, even our whole Armor of Righteouſneſs.</item>

Cor.
<pb n="343" facs="unknown:001244_0175_0FB18662E30F43F8"/>12.8 There is great need of <hi>Watching</hi> &amp; <hi>Praying:</hi> 1. Before we fall into Temptation. 2. When we are under Temptation. How <hi>Watching</hi> &amp; <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> conduceth to the anticipating the Aſſaults of <hi>Satan,</hi> fruſtrating Temptation. Firſt of all, for <hi>Watching.</hi>

                  <item>3. It is a countermine to all <hi>Satan's</hi> ſtratagems: It will deceive the Deceiver, to find us watching with ſpiritual diligence, when he would have us ſleeping in carnal ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</item>
                  <item>4. Watching ſecures us from much evil that might be added, in caſe we were drawn to the Temptation: for ſecurity is no better than a temptation, eſpecially at ſuch a time. Secondly, for <hi>Prayer:</hi> This conduceth to avoid the evil of Temptation, becauſe it fetcheth help from God, in whom is all our ſtrength: for it is Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>Call upon me in the day of trouble, I will deliver thee, &amp; thou ſhalt glorifie me,</hi> Pſal. 50 15.

            <p>This may inſtruct us. 1. Then there is great need of watching. It is certainly a univerſal neceſſary duty for all Saints, at whatever time, to watch: So ſaith <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Saviour, <hi>What I ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, I ſay unto all, Watch,</hi> Mar. 13.27.
