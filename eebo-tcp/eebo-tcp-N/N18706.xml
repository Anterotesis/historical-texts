            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>
                  <hi>PSALM</hi> LXXXV. II.</bibl>
               <q>TRUTH SHALL SPRING OUT OF THE EARTH; AND RIGHTEOUSNESS SHALL LOOK DOWN FROM HEAVEN.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THERE is a grandeur and elegancy in the ancient poetry of the Eaſt, which, in ſome particulars, has been unequalled in modern times. The words which I have read to you include a ſtriking illuſtration of the propriety of this remark, in which <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> two of the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted virtues conſpiring to ennoble the human race, are repreſented as forming both an eaſy and a happy junction—the <hi>one</hi> aſcending from <hi>the earth as when ſhe bringeth forth her bud, or from the garden when it cauſeth the things that are ſown in it to ſpring up</hi>—the <hi>other</hi> looking down like the benignant ſun in his daily courſe, directing us by his rays, and refreſhing us with his heat.</p>
            <p>To a perſon of taſte and ſcience, the recital of the text will, on this account, communicate an elegant pleaſure. But when it is conſidered that, added to this circumſtance, it contains a prophetic declaration
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:024287_0004_0FC5E751C78A86D8"/>
applying to <hi>the ſtate of man,</hi> we become intereſted in it as a <hi>public body.</hi> On the preſent agreeable occaſion, it ſolicits our attention, and will not fail, I hope, to afford us entertainment in our ſeveral ſtations and capacities as <hi>good ſoldiers</hi> or as <hi>ſtateſmen,</hi> as <hi>philoſophers</hi> and as <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WILL you permit me to add, I contemplate it with ſatisfaction, that at the requeſt of this <hi>ancient and hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable Company,</hi> I have it in my power to addreſs you at a time, when, judging of the ſtate of improvement, and the revolutions in the world, the prophecy which it contains, ſeems to be faſt verging to an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment.—Scarcely will it be needful to obſerve that it has an evident relation to the Meſſiah's reign on earth, embracing ſome proſperous condition of things, ſurpaſſing any which has yet appeared, when the knowledge and love of truth, which the Pſalmiſt, by a bold and brilliant figure, deſcribes as coming from the earth, ſhall really ariſe in the hearts of men, and <hi>the ſun of righteouſneſs</hi> look down and ſmile with bleſſings on them.</p>
            <p>INDEED beautiful as the text is, it compriſes little more than an epitome of the illuſtrious ſignatures of the times it ſo happily ſoretels; in which, relying on this and other gracious promiſes to the ſame effect, we find that knowledge, liberty, peace, holineſs, and happineſs will univerſally prevail.</p>
            <p>IN attempting to perform the duty annexed to the ſubject, it will be natural for me then, in the FIRST PLACE, to propoſe to you ſome of the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences corroborating the text, on which the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:024287_0005_0FC5E7532C38D0E8"/>
of ſo glorious an era appears to be founded—offering ſome general remarks concerning the time in which it may be expected. Having done this, I ſhall SECONDLY conſider the <hi>means</hi> which will prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably conſpire to its introduction—ſubjoining a few obſervations on the methods of improving the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent complexion of things in the world at large, and our country in particular.</p>
            <p>AMONG the ſacred references to this important era, the following, which are ſelected from many others, appear to be ſufficiently explicit. <hi>The earth ſhall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the ſea. Wiſdom and knowledge ſhall be the ſtability of the times. There ſhall be abundance of peace. They ſhall beat their ſwords into ploughſhares, and their ſpears into pruning hooks: Nation ſhall not lift up ſword againſt nation, neither ſhall they learn war any more; for they ſhall not hurt nor deſtroy. All the ends of the earth ſhall remember, and turn unto the Lord. In his days ſhall the righteous flouriſh. And it ſhall come to paſs, that in the place where it was ſaid unto them, Ye are not my People, there it ſhall be ſaid unto them, Ye are the Sons of the living God. And men ſhall be bleſſed in him: All nations ſhall call him bleſſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VARIOUS ſentiments have been held by commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators relating to the <hi>time,</hi> when theſe diſtinguiſhable prophecies will be fulfilled. Whilſt one claſs of writers has dated its exiſtence at a ſeaſon prior to the general reſurrection or conflagration of the world—according to the theory of another claſs, it is not to be expected 'till the ſecond advent of our Saviour on
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:024287_0006_0FC5E754BABC5C98"/>
the great day of judgment; after which, it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that the righteous will reign with the Redeemer on the earth, new formed amidſt the convulſion which is to paſs upon the ſyſtem, and properly prepared for their reception.</p>
            <p>THE preſent opportunity will not admit of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular diſcuſſion of the ſubject. As it is intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in its nature, and intimately connected with the buſineſs of the diſcourſe, I ſhall however briefly offer to you a few remarks, inclining me to give the prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the former of theſe theories.</p>
            <p>IN the <hi>firſt place,</hi> it is to be a preferred on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the general complexion of the language uſed by the inſpired writers in its numerous repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations. When we read of People and of Nations employed in converting their warlike weapons into inſtruments of huſbandry—<hi>of the mountains bringing forth peace, and the little hills producing righteouſneſs,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſalm lxxii. 3.</note> we find ourſelves tranſported among beings of our own claſs and order—we mix in thoſe ſcenes which have little or no affinity with the employments of the reſurrection ſtate—being vaſtly more allied to the circumſtances of the earth in its preſent ſituation, than when it will have been melted and transformed by fire. And whatever allowance may be made for the figurative manner in which the prophetic authors were accuſtomed to indite their thoughts, the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of every metaphor is excluded from this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject by what we learn in reference to the continuance
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:024287_0007_0FC5E75ADA9DA4F8"/>
of the ſeaſon, which the Pſalmiſt ſays will be <hi>as long as the ſun and the moon ſhall endure.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">In the 20th chapter of Revelation we are informed indeed, that, at the cloſe of this time, the tranquillity will be interrupted <hi>a little ſeaſon,</hi> by new ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ariſing in various quarters of the earth. But conſidering what is added concerning the inefficacy of the attempt, owing to the direct interpoſition of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in defence of the friends of righteouſneſs, immediately preceeding the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and end of the world, the propriety of the obſervation ſtill appears, when it is ſaid of this happy era that it ſhall laſt as long as the ſun and moon.</note>
            </p>
            <p>SECONDLY, the doctrine, I think, is to be inferred, with ſome degree of propriety, from a conſideration of the nature and perfection of the divine govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and adminiſtration over all human affairs.</p>
            <p>JUDGING from what appears to have been the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Creator, it is not ſo eaſy to ſuppoſe that a period will be put to the world by judgment and by conflagration, until a change has paſſed on it for the better. Scarcely does it ſeem ſufficient for the gratification of the good man to think that the clouds which have hovered round this terraqueous globe, ſhould be ſucceeded by the brightneſs of ſome <hi>future</hi> ſtate. As more honorary, in his eſtimation, to the Almighty Architect, may it not be expected that the darkneſs, which, through divine permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, has been ſpread over the earth, by the great adverſary of God and man, will be diſſipated long before the ſetting of the ſun—that <hi>he</hi> who crept in, by his wiles, into the habitations of men, will event<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually be driven from them, having firſt been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered on his own aſſumed ground—that where in conſequence of his ſucceſs, innumerable thorns and briars have riſen up, the myrtle tree will put forth its fragrant leaves, and the little ſhrubs their aromatick fruit—and that in exchange for <hi>Eden,</hi> once
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:024287_0008_0FC5E75F0BD7AD60"/>
the happy, but forfeited ſeat of the two progenitors of mankind, a new paradiſe will be formed, which inſtead of being circumſcribed by the ſmall bounds, capable of having been traverſed by Adam or by Eve, will be <hi>from ſea to ſea,</hi> and extend <hi>from the river to the end of the earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>INDEED of the riſe and glory of ſuch a diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed time, we find there has been a general impreſſion with many of the moſt refined and poliſhed nations of the world. It is the ſeaſon particularly noticed by the ancients under the deſcriptions of the <hi>golden age</hi>—<hi>the mighty years</hi>—<hi>the halcyon days,</hi> prognoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by their common bards, and celebrated by their more refined poets. The <hi>Pollio</hi> of <hi>Virgil</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Said to be taken from a Sibylline prophecy, which, by whatever fraud ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, corroborates the idea of the general expectation of the times of which it ſpeaks.</note> ſeems as if it had been compoſed with a pointed reference to the diſtinguiſhed circumſtances of the important era; in which the writer, no otherwiſe miſtaken than in the name and title of his profeſſed hero, bodly riſes on the lofty ſtrains rehearſed in the imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the celebrated Pope,—
<q>
                  <l>The Saviour comes, by ancient bards foretold;</l>
                  <l>Hear him ye deaf, and all ye blind behold.</l>
                  <l>No more ſhall nation againſt nation riſe.</l>
                  <l>Nor ardent warriors meet with hateful eyes.</l>
                  <l>The lambs with wolves ſhall graze the verdant mead,</l>
                  <l>And boys in flow'ry bands the tyger lead.</l>
                  <l>No ſigh—no murmur, the wide world ſhall hear;</l>
                  <l>From ev'ry face, he wipes off ev'ry tear.</l>
                  <l>Fix'd is his word—his ſaving pow'r remains;</l>
                  <l>His realm for ever laſts—the great Meſſiah reigns.</l>
               </q>

               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:024287_0009_0FC5E76106D6C350"/>
               <hi>Thus,</hi> as in the ſeventh day in the firſt ſacred week, when the Supreme Architect made a pauſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating what he had produced out of the preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chaotic ſtate, pronounced it very good, and ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified it to man—as on the ſabbatical year in the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh economy when the land had reſt—<hi>ſo,</hi> in this prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſed time of jubilee, the world ſhall enjoy an uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted ſeries of happineſs and compoſure—the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficent and wiſe deſigns of heaven relating to the preſent ſtate, aſſume the ſemblance of winding to a cloſe; and the affirmation of the angel to the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt be accompliſhed, when he ſaid, that <hi>in the days of the voice of the ſeventh angel, when he ſhall begin to ſound, the myſtery of God ſhould be finiſhed, as he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to his ſervants the prophets.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. x. 7.—It is well known that <hi>Seven</hi> is a kind of ſacred number in the ſcriptures, ſignifying in the ſeveral revolutions and diviſions of time, a ſeaſon of religion and reſt.

            </p>
            <p>IN the SECOND diviſion of the diſcourſe, it was propoſed to conſider the <hi>means,</hi> leading to the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of this auſpicious day. Among theſe, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that the progreſs of ſcience in the world, holds a conſpicuous rank. Deſpotic governments, with their concomitant evils, always maintain their ſtrength proportionate to the degrees of ignorance among the people. The dominion of tyranny is properly ſpeaking a dominion of <hi>darkneſs</hi>—ſupported by the impoſition of <hi>falſehood</hi> under the pretended veſtiges of <hi>truth</hi>—enervating the mental powers of human beings, and degrading them from the rank of men.

viſion, the head of which was of gold, but the feet of iron, mixed with rotten clay.—Againſt this, the kingdom of the Meſſiah is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly introduced, which, like the ſtone cut out of the mountain without hands, will eventually overthrow the uſurping idol, and maintain its place for ever. Indeed, unlike the kingdoms of this world, it is of a ſpiritual nature—deſigned to illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the underſtandings, and regulate the affections of its ſubjects. By informing them for what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes they were ſent into the world—enjoining a ſupreme veneration to the great Author of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and next to this, and affectionate regard to one another, as children of the ſame eternal Father—par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the like wants, and brethren of one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon family, it is eminently calculated to meliorate the events which may be expected by them in human life, until they are firſt prepared, and afterward tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to heaven. It is the kingdom which God has given to his Son—the laws by which it is governed—the promiſes which give it life, and the ſanctions ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring to its ſupport, being written by Prophets and Apoſtles inſpired for the honourable work, and guided by a hand which is divine.</p>
            <p>WITH much reaſon it might be expected, that principles thus pure in themſelves, and friendly to the common benefit of mankind, would be diſreliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by deſpots and their dependants, whoſe object is a monopoly of power, as it is of grandeur and wealth. Either therefore by a direct denial of the authenticity of the ſacred ſcriptures, or by the eſtabliſhment of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:024287_0011_0FC5E76E0A6ADAD8"/>
religious hierarchies, profeſſedly aſſiſting, but actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſubverting their operation, a great part of the governments which have hitherto exiſted in the world, have united with meretricious zeal. From ſuch powerful cauſes, aided no doubt by the moral depravity annexted to human nature in general, throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a veil before the intellectual viſion, it has come to paſs that the progreſs of religious ſcience has, for many ages, been comparatively ſmall. But the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of mankind is too deeply concerned, to allow ſuch licentious impoſitions to remain perpetual. The enlarged cultivation of the art of printing, by which the mild and equitable principles of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion become more generally known—the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of commerce, introducing man to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with his fellow man—the burdens inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to tyrannical governments, with the public bankruptcies which are threatened in conſequence of the wanton wars concerted through the meer ambition of ſtateſmen and of princes, will no doubt, conſpire in time, to produce alarms, where deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm now prevails, occaſioning many revolutions, in which the people will judge it prudent to take the lead.</p>
            <p>FORESEEING theſe things, it has pleaſed the benev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent Creator of the world, plainly to foretel that the time will certainly come when mankind univerſally ſhall be free. And he has foretold it, not only as a probable event, reſulting from an application of the truths of revealed writ to the general benefit of ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, but as that, which by his wiſe and holy provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:024287_0012_0FC5E774F81EAB30"/>
he is determined to bring to paſs. The lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage in which he has aſſerted it is, <hi>I the Lord will perform it.</hi> In the government of the world, he no doubt, acts by means—making uſe of the reaſon and abilities of his creatures in the accompliſhment of his wiſe deſigns. Acquainted with theſe means, and reaſoning from analogy, we may often judge of their operation with a great degree of probability and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion. But there would be an uncertainty attending all human things, were they to be left unaided by the concurrent influence of a divine and overruling Mind. By ways and methods which are often out of ſight by <hi>us,</hi> but perfectly coincident with the well known and eſtabliſhed doctrine of the moral liberty and free agency of man, the purpoſes of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Wiſdom are brought to view. In expectation of the joyful jubilee on which we are now contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating, we may therefore rely not only on the prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able conjunction of natural cauſes and effects, but more ſurely on the divine promiſe certifying the event, and making it the proper object of a rational and yet implicit faith. Thus ſupported by the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted aids of reaſon and revelation—to the pleaſure, we add the triumph of our faith, in anticipating the happy era, when, in every nation under heaven, <hi>the eyes of the blind will be opened, to releaſe the priſoners from their priſon, and them that ſit in darkneſs from the priſon-houſe</hi>—<hi>when the broken-hearted ſhall be comforted, and liberty proclaimed to the captive</hi>—<hi>they that erred in ſpirit, being brought to underſtanding, and they that mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured to ſound doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:024287_0013_0FC5E778BAAAE008"/>
IN the preceeding obſervations, the view which we have taken, has been principally confined to the emancipation of mankind from the ſhackles of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and the emporium of reaſon in every nation of the world. A more important article included in this promiſed era, is that of the univerſal prevalency of <hi>religion;</hi> which, as it will be productive of the peaceful ſtate ſo beautifully deſcribed by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetic writers, will operate, with like ſucceſs, to complete the happineſs and glory of the times.</p>
            <p>ARGUING from the maxims already propoſed, it is eaſy to conceive that at leaſt there may be a decided conviction of the value of political liberty, and a general ſtruggle in its behalf, where the knowledge of religions in its ſpirituality and truth is by no means univerſal in its operation. The idea of <hi>intereſt alone,</hi> reſulting from the improvements made in ſociety by experience and by time, may be ſufficiently operative in the production of very aſtoniſhing changes in the political world. Whilſt we are at no loſs therefore in accounting for the exiſtence of ſuch changes in the former of theſe articles, we ſeem to be under the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of examining ſtill further for the cauſe of the latter.</p>
            <p>AND this I conceive to be no other than the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating influence of the Divine Spirit, which, when to anſwer the wiſe purpoſes for which the Deity gave permiſſion, the myſtery of iniquity will have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently worked—the weakneſs of all error been detect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the force of moral principles obtained at leaſt a ſpeculative triumph, he will then plentifully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:024287_0014_0FC5E77A4DBC53B0"/>
to the world; and thus, by refining the minds of men, will confirm them in the belief of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious truth—by meliorating their diſpoſitions, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to them the enjoyment of liberty and peace—and by ſanctifying their hearts, prepare them for the reception of every bleſſing they can enjoy both here, and for ever hereafter.</p>
            <p>THEN ſhall the reign of virtue—the expected time of reſt—the promiſed Sabbath—the Meſſiah's king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom on earth, be happily conſummated; and the ancient prophecy of Daniel, comprehending many others of more recent date, advance to its complete fulfilment—<hi>I ſaw in the night viſions, and behold one like the Son of Man, came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of Days, and they brought him near before him. And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages ſhould ſerve him: his dominion is an everlaſting dominion which ſhall not paſs away, and his kingdom that which ſhall not be deſtroyed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>PROCEEDING now from general principles to their application, it may be proper in this place, to take a view of the preſent ſtate of ſociety in the world, and enquire in what progreſs it appears to be toward the enjoyment of the expected bleſſings—ſo far eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially as relates to the articles of knowledge and liberty, which according to the account that has been given, will be progreſſive in their operation, preceeding the univerſal prevalency of religion which will crown the whole.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:024287_0015_0FC5E77BADAEA420"/>
AND I muſt take occaſion here to congratulate my reſpected hearers, not only on the preſent political ſtate of their country, but on the circumſtance of their having lived in an age, when, as among the heavenly bodies, a newly diſcovered planet, through the penetration of an <hi>Herſchel,</hi> was added to the ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of which the earth is part, ſo the United States of America, by a mighty movement in the great order of human things, were at the ſame time brought forward to the admiring gaze of all the ſons of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and amidſt their acclamations, took rank among the nations of the world.</p>
            <p>IT will be needleſs to attempt the recital of the remarkable ſcenes accompanying the proceſſion of this great event. With thoſe who now hear me, and have borne no inconſiderable part, as ſtateſmen in projecting—as ſoliders by confirming, and as phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanthropiſts in contemplating them, their memory will be coequal with the duration of life. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal buſineſs before us is the conſideration of their effects. And important as theſe have been to the inhabitants of the United States, the circumſtance which renders the revolution of the higheſt value is the influence which it appears to have on the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of mankind in general, ariſing from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception that it embraces no other than the common cauſe of the great majority of people in every clime and nation of the globe.—Where is the place in which the political doctrines which gave it brith—the actions by which it was ſuſtained—the ſignal providences appearing in its behalf, with the unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leled
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:024287_0016_0FC5E781B3162000"/>
ſucceſs by which it was finally crowned, have not been received with avidity, and contemplated with ſurprize? From the general diſcuſſion it has introduced on the ſubject of national politicks, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of light has emanated, through which many ancient but falſe maxims have been highly exploded—the deſign of government, with the proper buſineſs of public magiſtrates been freely diſcuſſed;—and whilſt the antiquated notion of the divine commiſſion and authority of earthly ſovereigns, true only as it related to the Jews, has been giving way to the more rational opinion that <hi>it is God makes men, and men make kings,</hi> MAN has come forward in his proper garb on the theatre of human life, where, inſtead of waiting like the ſilent mute for the ſingle purpoſe of external ornament, he has had his opinion to make known, and his part of act in the important drama.</p>
            <p>IN the mean time, the objects of religious hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies have been cloſely inſpected. Exploded in the <hi>new</hi> world, they have ſunk in eſtimation in the <hi>old.</hi> It is perceived that the rights of conſcience are too ſacred to be regulated by mortals. The languages which has been held on the nature of religious liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, has been ſufficiently energetic to command an univerſal hearing; and what a few years paſt, would have brought the abettors to the dungeon or the ſtake, is now triumphant over the united influence of the Inquiſitions in Spain and Portugal, or of the Vatican in Rome.</p>
            <p>ON the ſubject of political changes, it is impoſſible to reflect without advertence to the preſent ſtate of
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:024287_0017_0FC5E783F0D52110"/>
               <hi>France.</hi> Important to the world in general, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting to Americans, both as the profeſſed friends of univerſal freedom, and the recipients of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of this magnanimous people, in a time of trouble.</p>
            <p>WE love the French: It is the debt of gratitude, for they loves us. In France we have a <hi>brother.</hi> When the fair ſtandard of American liberty was erected, he heard the tidings. As the friend of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, he croſſed the Atlantic to behold and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect it. He put his ſoul into the act; and having returned with the affections of Columbia's ſons, <hi>Fayette</hi> is now conſpicuous near the like ſtandard in his native country, to join in dreſſing it with its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per trophies, and to behold it flouriſh. The time is come when the like trophies are in general admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and the ſons of freedom, in whatever place they dwell, are viewed as <hi>brethren.</hi> We have lived to ſee the world in mighty motion—combinations forming to relieve the oppreſſed and ſet the ſons of Afric free—the rights of man aſſumed—ſtate pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons torn—political and moral principles examined with becoming freedom; and whilſt <hi>many are running to and fro, knowledge is increaſing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN fine—if it might not be deemed too particular, I ſhould propoſe it for enquiry, whether, judging from the paſt as well as preſent combination of events, there is not ſufficient reaſon to conclude, that we have advanced to that important part of time delineated hieroglyphically in the viſion of St. John, by the pouring out of the ſixth vial on the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:024287_0018_0FC5E7856C02E438"/>
Euphrates? in which time, <hi>as formerly</hi> by turning the waters of that river, and making the channel dry, a way was found for the admiſſion of the Eaſtern kings <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Cyaxeres</hi> into <hi>Babylon,</hi> terminating in the deliverance of the Jews, then acknowledged to be the people of God, <hi>ſo now,</hi> the floods of error are gradually paſſing away before us, <hi>introductory</hi> to the complete eſtabliſhment of the kingdom of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and truth, when, after the yet expected ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of events, the ſeventh and laſt angel will pour his vial into the air, the ſeat of Satan's ſway—a voice out of the temple of heaven from the throne will ſay, <hi>It is done</hi>—the millenium ſtate, or empire of holineſs commence with the diſtinguiſhed luſtre promiſed in the Meſſiah's reign, and <hi>the whole earth be filled with his glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HAVING thus gone through with the principal ideas ſuggeſted by the text, and taken a view of the preſent moral and political ſtate of man, a few ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations ſhall be ſubjoined, ariſing from the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſituation of our country, and on the happy methods of its improvement.</p>
            <p>PERHAPS it may be thought a miſtake, but I ſhall notwithſtanding venture to obſerve, that, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the degree of political knowledge prevailing in America, it appears to me to be next to impoſſible that tyranny ſhould ever be eſtabliſhed in the United States. The ſentiment, it is preſumed, is founded on the reaſon and nature of things: But if the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding conſtruction of the ſcripture promiſes be true, it is removed ſtill further from the admiſſion of diſpute.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:024287_0019_0FC5E786EEAE3DB8"/>
FOR myſelf therefore I muſt confeſs that I look forward, without the leaſt anxiety on this article, and anticipate many ſucceeding generations, each of them illuſtrious for a happy race of freemen. It does not follow however, that we are to expect a complete exemption from political evils. In the preſent imperfect ſtate of human nature, a revolution in the government may not only be productive of a neceſſary change of <hi>duties,</hi> but in ſome reſpects, of a change of <hi>dangers.</hi> There will every where be ſiniſter and ſordid men, who, when deſirous of places of emolument or honour, will be leſs anxious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the means, than the certainty of their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment. Theſe are the time-ſervers and the ſycophants, who, in monarchical governments, will ſurround the court, or be ſeen cringing within the vortex of the throne; and in the governments which are more popular, will be equally buſy, fluttering and negotiating, on all ſides, in the aſſemblies of the people. The object of their attraction is the ſame in one as in the other ſituation: It is the power of ſerving and promoting <hi>them,</hi> which, whether it be lodged in <hi>many</hi> or in a <hi>few,</hi> like the ſhrines of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius, will be ſure of commanding a great croud of adorers, crying, though in more modernized lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, <hi>Great is Diana of the Epheſians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>CONSIDERING this ſubject with the attention it deſerves, may it not then, with propriety, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that one of the moſt certain means produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the ſafety and happineſs of a people, conſiſts in their ability to diſtinguiſh and find out diſinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:024287_0020_0FC5E78B4D6C2C28"/>
and honeſt men to conſtitute the ſeveral de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments by which the laws are enacted, and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs profeſſedly maintained. <hi>Let the king live for ever,</hi> will invariably be the form of expreſſion among ſuitors and dependants, where abſolute mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archy prevails. It is juſt as neceſſary in republicks, that the congratulatory addreſs ſhould be to <hi>liberty</hi> and the <hi>conſtitution. Liberty</hi> is one of the nobleſt of all the birthrights, which a wiſe and rational man can wiſh. But whilſt the intereſted, as well as the diſintereſted, may equally profeſs to be within the number of its votaries, the inhabitants of theſe States will no doubt diſcover the neceſſity of committing the protections of their laws and privileges to <hi>approved patriots</hi>—judiciouſly guarding againſt the arts of thoſe who meerly addreſs themſelves to the popular feelings of a day, thereby enfeebling the ſocial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact—and preſerving a juſt reſpect for the political ſentiments which are frank and undiſguiſed, having been formed on an acquaintance with the hiſtory of government in the world, exhibiting the various occaſions of the riſe and fall of nations, teſtiſied by reaſon, and confirmed by indubitable experience.</p>
            <p>I CANNOT help adding a remark or two, in this place, on the ſubject of religion. The unjuſtifiable influence of the Church, with the unbounded power of its dignitaries and other prieſts, in various parts of Europe, has had the unhappy effect of occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much infidelity with great numbers of the laity, who, from their wealth and ſtation in life, profeſs to think freely, or without ſubjection to exterior con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trol;
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:024287_0021_0FC5E7918B0ADBC8"/>
and as this influence is now continually di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing, even with the other ranks and claſſes of the people, it is probable that, in a few years, the intereſts of religion will undergo a more material convulſion, the conſequences of which will very generally be perceived and known. Certainly there is much weakneſs in refuſing to admit the evidence of truth owing to the errors and miſconduct of a part of thoſe who are its profeſſed abettors. The various enormities, both in the doctrines and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices of many churches, were really to be expected, becauſe they were long ago foretold by the great Author of our Religion; and every argument of this kind, was thus completely wreſted from the cauſe of infidelity.</p>
            <p>BUT whatever may have been the bad effects of ſuch religious impoſitions in ſeveral of the nations in Europe, it is hoped they will not extend to the citizens of America. For the credit of religion, it is no more than reaſonable to obſerve, that among the promoters of the Revolution in this country, there is no claſs of perſons who have been more indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable in their ſtations than the body of the clergy—explicitly declaring their diſapprobation of all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious eſtabliſhments—thus committing their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral intereſt to the governance of the people—aſſuming no influence but ſuch as might ariſe from the general manner of their lives, and ſerious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the duties of their office—hereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving every occaſſion of diſtruſt and jealouſy againſt their order, and offering themſelves, on well-known
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:024287_0022_0FC5E79538243140"/>
principles, as the conſtant candidates for the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and eſteem of thoſe whom they profeſs to ſerve. What the conſequence <hi>has</hi> been, where the Church and State have been blended together, as in ſome countries, is already diſcovered. What the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence <hi>may</hi> be, in relation to the preſent ſyſtem adopted in America, leſs than half a century now before us, will clearly determine. In the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the national ſyſtem of government, it is a matter, I conceive, which is worthy of attention. Whilſt the clergy have no intereſt claſhing with that of the laity's, but the ſacred offices of religion are engaged in by the former from a ſincere apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their importance, and ſuitably encouraged by the latter from the like faith and motives, it may be preſumed that the moſt ſalutary effects will be experienced by the community. In attempting to lay the foundation for the happineſs of poſterity, it is not only wiſe and virtuous, but abſolutely requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, to call in the united aids of morality and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Never were the proſpects of any people more promiſing and glorious than thoſe of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of theſe States, or the means and capacity greater for rendering them ſucceſsful. Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial on the exertions productive of the Revolution in America, the mental abilities of her ſons ſeem to have been brought forward at an earlier period than is uſual, and to have expanded to a fuller growth. From the contemplation of the vaſt ſcenes through which we paſſed during the war, and the great and important buſineſs which has been tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:024287_0023_0FC5E797CC00E040"/>
ſince the peace, there is an energy of mind, and a genius characteriſtical of Americans, which, like a the Eagle in the eſcutcheon of the National Arms, delights itſelf in ſoaring high, and behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing objects which are great as well as deep. What tends ſtill further to the growth of this mental in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigoration, is the knowledge of the vaſt capaciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the territory belonging to the United States, already increaſing in population with the moſt aſtoniſhing repidity, and in like manner improving in the arts. It is to be expected that the ſucceeding age will make progreſſion both in agriculture and ſcience, which, if it were poſſible for us to behold it, would inſpire our minds with equal wonder and delight. On the excurſive pinions of imagination, we will now take the view. Roving by the peren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial fountains, or on the verdant banks of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andring ſtreams, we perceive the buſy huſbandman employed in gathering the rich bounties of <hi>Ceres</hi> and <hi>Pomona</hi>—the hills around him vocal with the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick of his bleating flocks—the meads and vallies blooming like the roſe. Where the Wigwam ſtood, behold the <hi>Capitol</hi> erects its lofty dome, and the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred <hi>Church</hi> its ſpire. Cities after cities riſe to court the admiration of the obſervant eye; whilſt Patriot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm and Philoſophy find new <hi>Waſhingtons</hi> and <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks, Adamſes</hi> and <hi>Franklins,</hi> to add to the reſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency and importance of the times.—Thus it is that <hi>Fancy</hi> aſſumes the privilege to indulge her ſportive flights. Guided, as ſhe profeſſes in the preſent caſe by the conductreſs <hi>Reaſon,</hi> her flights are not in vain.

Hail to the riſing glory of this Weſtern World! Hail to the more happy days of univerſal peace and freedom! <hi>Let thy ways, O Lord, be known on earth; and thy ſaving health among all nations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AS the ſubject on which we have contemplated, is highly intereſting to every friend of liberty and his country, there is, I conceive, a particular applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it due on this occaſion, to the ancient and honourable Company, at whoſe deſire we are now aſſembled.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Worthy and reſpected Gentlemen,</hi>

            <p>WITH pleaſure I addreſs you as the members of an aſſociation, incorporated more than a century and half, as a military ſchool and nurſery for officers, the utility of which has been experienced from its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement to the preſent time.

if, in the courſe of human events, there ſhould ever be the neceſſity of taking the field again. You ſtudy tacticks from no delight in war, but from the laudable and benevolent principle of maintaining righteouſneſs with peace. Inſpired by ſo rational and conciliating a motive, you are entitled to the thanks of your countrymen for the perſeverance which you manifeſt in the duties of your inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. From the reſpectable abilities of the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers whom in time paſt you have choſen to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you, as well as from the military knowledge and attention of the Captain<note n="‡" place="bottom">Colonel JOSIAH WATERS.</note> who leads your corps this day, you no doubt derive very eſſential advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. Reflecting on the preſent glory of America, it is a ſatisfaction which you owe yourſelves, to call to mind how many members of your aſſociation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came diſtinguiſhed in the late noble conteſt for our liberties, whoſe heroick actions, with their names, the page of hiſtory will faithfully tranſmit to the lateſt times.</p>
            <p>THE polite attentions, added to the preſence of your commander in chief, the Governour of this Commonwealth, with that of the principal Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the civil and other offices in the State on theſe publick days of your anniverſary election, muſt be convincing teſtimonies to you of their great eſteem for your ancient corps, and their approbation of its honourable deſign. Having performed the religious ſervice of the <hi>Church,</hi> we ſhall cordially accompany you to the <hi>Hall,</hi> where the feſtive board
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:024287_0026_0FC5E79D0B98B448"/>
will be ſurrounded by ſo many friends and defenders of the proper rights of man, and the hilarity during the regalement, as well as through the future paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times and military evolutions of the day, be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of thoſe philanthropick ſenſations which extend from our country to every nation on the globe.</p>
            <p>RECEIVE from us our moſt hearty wiſhes for your future proſperity and honour. Engaged in protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the liberties of your countrymen, may you at the ſame time experience the efficacy of that ſacred and religious freedom, which is propoſed to us through the great Captain of our ſpiritual and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ſalvation—that when you quit the ranks mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itant on earth, you may be admitted to the angelick companies in heaven—and putting off the ſword and buckler which are worn by Combatants, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the crowns of Conquerors in the celeſtial ſtate.</p>
            <p>To this reſpectable aſſembly in general, let me now obſerve, that pleaſing as our political and other proſpects may be conſidered, the time allowed us in which to enjoy them is ſhort and tranſient; after which, our conduct on the ſerious queſtion of their improvement, will paſs a moſt ſolemn and auguſt review. An apprehenſion of the brevity of human life, ſhould inſtruct us to comprize in it as many duties as is poſſible. Among theſe, I preſume, we may rank the duties which we owe our country in particular, and the world at large.</p>
            <p>SHALL I be allowed to make the enquiry, whether to the other methods of improvement, and the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous inſtitutions among us, the eſtabliſhment of
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:024287_0027_0FC5E79F4AC143F0"/>
a <hi>Revolution</hi> or <hi>Conſtitutional Society,</hi> might not be attended with important advantages—part of the buſineſs of which ſhould conſiſt in a regular correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondency with thoſe of the ſame names in Europe, and the objects be the diſſemination of the great principles of liberty and good government, and the introduction of ſome well-concerted plan among the nations, as the baſis of a univerſal peace.<note n="†" place="bottom">An idea of this kind has frequently been propoſed, within the preſent age, in ſeveral large or national aſſemblies in Europe as well as in America. From the ſtate of things on the old Continent, and indeed from the complexion of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture prophecies, there is reaſon to think that very deſperate meaſures will be adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that there will be much war and bloodſhed for ſome time to come, before the power, annexed to the various civil and eccleſiaſtical uſurpations, will be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and the people maintain their rights. But as theſe important objects may be expected in the iſſue, no ſmall encouragement therefore is exhibited to each aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation on the afore-mentioned plan; for though the good effects might not very ſoon be univerſal, it is probable they would, in ſome particulars, be real; and in junction with other means, might at length be happily inſtrumental in producing the full eſtabliſhment of the deſired event.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THE happy influence of theſe Societies abroad has been confeſſedly experienced; and in ſpeaking of them, I am led to pay a tribute of reſpect to the memory of a diſtinguiſhed member, not long ſince deceaſed in Great-Britain, whoſe known attachment to the general cauſe of liberty, and affectionate writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in favour of the intereſt of America, have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed his name upon our hearts. Could we pay a viſit to the tomb of <hi>Doctor</hi> PRICE, we would ſhed a tear of friendſhip on his hallowed urn; or if the harmonious muſick of the band this day, could reach the dead, we would bid it ceaſe a while its martial notes, and ſoftly ſtrike the funeral dirge.</p>
            <p>WHAT a bleſſed revelation is the Goſpel of the Son of God, in which we learn, that after the body ſinks, or goes to mingle with its native duſt, the
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:024287_0028_0FC5E7A1EC42D750"/>
ſpirit ſtill ſurvives! In the great world of ſpirits, the friends of liberty, in its moral and moſt exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſenſe, ſhall meet in perfect and never-ending bliſs.—And with this idea, I conclude.—Glorious as are the promiſes we have contemplated relating to the proſperous ſtate of nations, and the happy days of univerſal jubilee, they are bounded by what may properly be called the events of <hi>time.</hi> "The cloud-capt tow'rs—the gorgeous palaces—the ſolemn temples—the great globe itſelf, with all that it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit, ſhall diſſolve—and like the baſeleſs fabrick of a viſion, leave not a wrack behind." Or, in more energetick, becauſe inſpired language—<hi>The heavens ſhall paſs away with a great noiſe, and the elements ſhall melt with fervent heat; the earth alſo, and the works that are therein, ſhall be burnt up.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT there are other promiſes which reach forward to <hi>eternity.</hi> If we are found among the friends of truth and virtue, we ſhall be able to ſtand unmoved amidſt the convulſions of the preſent ſyſtem; for there are prepared for us <hi>new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteouſneſs;</hi> and we ſhall live eternally with the Lord.—To him be everlaſting praiſes.</p>
