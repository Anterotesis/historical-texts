            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>MY HEARERS,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THIS day completes ſixty-eight years ſince the birth of the illuſtrious <hi>GEORGE WASHINGTON,</hi> formerly leader of the American people, in their ſtruggle for inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence; twice ſucceſſively Preſident of the United States of America; and late Lieutenant-General and Commander in Chief of their armies. For many years the anniverſary of his birth has been obſerved as a day of feſtivity. Its return was wont to infuſe into the people of America pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly pleaſing emotions. They welcomed it as the natal day of one whom they highly eſteemed for his talents and virtues; to whom they felt grateful for his beneficial labors on their behalf; and to whom they ſtill looked as a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor for advice, and as an experienced leader to guide their armies if diſturbed by domeſtic, or invaded by foreign enemies. But alas! the ſcene is changed; their hopes are blaſted. The FRIEND, the FATHER, the political DELIV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ERER of his country no longer lives! Having accompliſhed the purpoſes for which he was deſigned in the counſels of Heaven, the ſovereign diſpoſer of all events has called him from life; he now ſleeps with his fathers in the peaceful tomb. And thoſe feſtive ſongs with which this day has been accuſtomed to be celebrated muſt give place to mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſtrains. "The joy of our heart is ceaſed; our dance is turned into mourning. For this our heart is ſaint; for this our eyes are dim."</p>
            <p>IN compliance with the recommendation of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Legiſlature, communicated in a proclamation from
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037430_0004_100D41B967731F00"/>
our reſpected Chief Magiſtrate, we have now aſſembled in the ſanctuary of the Lord, not to hail the birth day of the Man we loved, with ſongs of joy, but in accents of woe to lament his death, and to pay a tribute of reſpect to his memory. Called upon by my fellow-citizens, I am now to addreſs you on the mournful occaſion. I ſhould ſhrink from the taſk were it not for the known candor of my au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. I feel myſelf incompetent to do juſtice to ſo great a character, and unable to ſuggeſt any new ideas on a ſubject on which my hearers have already heard and read ſo much. Any thing new concerning the life or character of <hi>GENE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAL WASHINGTON</hi> cannot be expected from me. With the various particulars of his life many of you are better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted than myſelf; and his character has been already delineated to you in a manner which I cannot expect to equal. But the portrait of a friend is not the leſs pleaſing for being often viewed. I flatter myſelf therefore, that you will favor me with your attention, and that your candor will excuſe a repetition of ideas which you may have heard before. What I propoſe is to notice ſome of the leading traits in the character of that great man for whom our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this day mourns; to recommend his virtues to your imitation; and to make ſome religious and moral reflections on his death. My remarks will be grounded on the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing paſſage of inſpiration:</p>
            <q>
               <bibl>ISAIAH iii. 1, 2, 3.</bibl>
BEHOLD the LORD, the LORD of Hoſts, doth take away—the mighty man, and the man of war—the prudent—the honorable man, and the counſellor.</q>
            <p>WHEN, my brethren, has there appeared a char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter to whom the epithets here uſed by the Prophet might be applied with ſo much propriety as to the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037430_0005_100D41BB85EADCB0"/>
great <hi>WASHINGTON?</hi> He was truly a <hi>mighty man,</hi> as he was endowed with an aſſemblage of talents very rarely found combined in one man;—talents which qualified him for diſtinguiſhed uſefulneſs to the country that gave him birth, and which ſecured to him the applauſes of an admiring world. He was <hi>mighty</hi> in war and <hi>mighty</hi> in peace; ſingularly emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in public and equally amiable in private life. Uniformly guided by a ſenſe of duty, he ſeems to have been free from the influence of every ſordid, of every mean paſſion, and to have been exempt from thoſe foibles which are often found to attend men worthy in other reſpects.</p>
            <p>HE was a <hi>man of war.</hi> At a very early period of life, he became diſtinguiſhed for his ſkill as a military commander, and often led the forces of his native ſtate in dangerous enterpriſes. On all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions he acquitted himſelf with honor and gained the applauſes of his country, <q>diſplaying uniform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uncommon fortitude under perſonal hardſhips, perſevering induſtry, cool and undaunted brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the moſt brilliant military talents.</q> When the late war, which happily terminated in the eſtabliſhment of the United States as a free and independent nation, commenced, all eyes were turned to the man, who had already ſo highly ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalized himſelf, as the moſt ſuitable perſon in the nation, to take the command of their armies. With that ſelf-diffidence which ever accompanies true merit he accepted the command. At the call of his countrymen, indignant at their wrongs, and deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037430_0006_100D41BFB9E10FF8"/>
to free them from an oppreſſive yoke, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſhed the pleaſing charms of a happy retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and expoſed himſelf to ſcenes where every thing dear to man was at ſtake. Of the manner in which he executed this important and dangerous commiſſion, I need not ſpeak. The various events of the war, which are freſh in the recollection of many of my hearers, from their having either borne an active part in them or intimately known them at the time, and which thoſe of us in earlier life have heared from our fathers, bear an ample teſtimony to his intrepid bravery, ſingular prudence, great preſence of mind, uncommon knowledge of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and great fruitfulneſs in the invention of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources to extricate himſelf, the army, and the country from dangerous ſcenes. When the war terminated he diſplayed the ſame magnanimity which he had before manifeſted. In a dignified manner he reſigned his commiſſion, and retired to the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful walks of private life.</p>
            <p>COMPARE him with ALEXANDER, JULIUS CAESAR, CHARLES of Sweden, or FREDERIC of Pruſſia, to whoſe names hiſtory has attached the epithet of great. As military commanders they were great, but they were guided either by a mad ambition to extend their conqueſts, by a wiſh to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave their country, by a precipitate raſhneſs, or a thirſt for military glory. They unreluctantly ſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rificed the lives of thouſands to gratify their own ambition; and though we may be dazzled with the rapidity and extent of their conqueſts, we muſt
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037430_0007_100D41C14891F458"/>
ſhudder at the recital of the carnage, deſtruction and miſery with which thoſe conqueſts were atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; we muſt deſpiſe the men for the meanneſs of the views by which they were actuated. Compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with theſe how truly, how uniformly great does the HERO of America appear! Entirely free from thoſe ſordid principles which have fixed an indelible ſtain upon their reputations, he was guided ſolely by a regard to the public weal. He unſheathed his ſword not to enſlave his country but to redreſs its wrongs, and when this object was accompliſhed, he returned it to its ſcabbard, and retired to ſhare with others the happy fruits of his toil.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>prudent, the honorable man, and the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor.</hi> Equally appropriate to the character of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral <hi>WASHINGTON</hi> are theſe epithets with thoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready noticed. Prudence was a very ſtriking trait in his character. He exhibited many marks of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common diſcretion, through the whole courſe of his life, both in the field and in the cabinet. When commanding the armies of his country, and when at the head of its civil government, he was many times placed in trying ſituations; he was called to paſs through ſcenes which not only would have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged a mind leſs firm and reſolute than his, but which required a diſpaſſionate coolneſs, a ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious prudence to prevent their iſſuing in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt evil. The manner in which he conducted in ſuch ſituations evinced the ſuperiority of his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and his profound prudence. In this virtue
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037430_0008_100D41C399276C30"/>
he ſhone unrivalled, and it was owing to this that he never committed an action which, in the view of impartial poſterity, will tarniſh a reputation more ſplendid than that of any of the ſons of men.</p>
            <p>A CHARACTER more uniformly <hi>honorable</hi> than his hiſtory does not record. He was loaded with every honor which his country had to beſtow, and continually received marks of eſteem and reſpect from all parts of the civilized world. Of theſe honors he proved himſelf worthy by a conduct uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly noble, great and honorable. Free from thoſe blemiſhes which are often found to ſtain the characters of men great in many reſpects, our belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved chieftain never was known, in public or in private life, to be guilty of an action irreconcileable with honor, dignity or propriety. In diſcharging the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of thoſe high ſtations which he was called to fill, he was connected with men of every character, the baſe as well as the worthy. Tho often diſguſted with the meanneſs and littleneſs of the former, from a becoming dignity of deportment he never depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: tho attempts were often made to injuire him, by ambitious and deſigning men who were envious of his talents and virtues, and who wiſhed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs him that they might exalt themſelves, we find him ever conducting towards them ſo as to give them no juſt occaſion to impeach his honor or to reproach him of treating them unworthily. To theſe who know the embarraſſments he met with from officers under his command, during the revolutionary war, to thoſe who are acquainted with the continual ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:037430_0009_100D41C5542D5438"/>
thrown in his way, by the enemies of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, during his preſidency, I appeal for the truth of theſe remarks.</p>
            <p>HIS having been twice choſen Preſident of the United States by the unanimous ſuffrages of the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of every ſtate, evinces the high opinion which his fellow-citizens entertained of him as a <hi>Counſellor,</hi> as a political ruler.—His conduct through the whole courſe of his adminiſtration ſhows that the opinion of his countrymen was not ill-founded, that their confidence was not miſ-placed. When firſt called to the chief magiſtracy, his ſituation was peculiar. The form of government at the head of whoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration he was placed was new. He had to tread in an unbeaten path, and in many reſpects to eſtabliſh regulations not only for himſelf but for his ſucceſſors in office. The friends of the conſtitution, deſirous of its permanent eſtabliſhment, looked to him with an anxious eye, knowing that much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on the meaſures which he ſhould adopt; and equally attentive were its enemies to watch his actions hoping to find ſomething which they might make uſe of as an inſtrument for the ſubverſion of the government. The great wiſdom with which he diſcharged the duties of his high office, and the happy fruits of his adminiſtration, aſtoniſhed the world no leſs than the ſplendid talents which he had exhibited as a military commander. He diſplayed the ſame dignified conduct, the ſame ſagacious pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and the ſame elevation of mind which had marked his character in other ſcenes. And when
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037430_0010_100D41C869A7C9B0"/>
he declined a re-election and once more retired to private life, he gave occaſion to his country and to the world at large again to admire his moderation, his freedom from an unworthy ambition, his patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otiſm, his magnanimity.</p>
            <p>HE was not permitted to enjoy, for any length of time, the retirement he had ſo ardently wiſhed. He ſaw his country threatened by an inſidious foe; and tho arrived at a time of life when he might have juſtly plead an exemption from any further public ſervice, he conſented again to put himſelf at the head of the American army, ſhould that army be called to action; at the ſame time declining, as he had ever before done, any pecuniary reward for his ſervices.</p>
            <p>To this view of his character I beg leave to add another trait which tended ſtill more highly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt and enoble him. I allude to his reverence for the GOD of his fathers. The ſuperintending Prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idence of the Moſt High he ever acknowledged. To this he aſcribed his ſucceſſes, not to his own ſkill and proweſs; to this he aſcribed the proſperity of the United States, not to the wiſdom and labors of their rulers. On all ſuitable occaſions he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed a becoming gratitude to GOD for his kind interpoſitions in behalf of the army or the nation; and when defeated in any of his expectations, he devoutly acknowledged the ſame Providence and ſubmiſſively bowed to the rod.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:037430_0011_100D41CA6274A9D8"/>
THUS was he ever both great and good; great as a warrior;—great as a politician;—great as a private citizen; and good as a humble worſhipper of GOD.</p>
            <p>SOON after he received and accepted the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of Commander in Chief of the armies of the United States, it pleaſed the great arbiter of life and death ſuddenly to terminate his earthly courſe. Mature in years, loaded with honors, loved by his country, applauded by the world, he fell a victim to a ſhort diſeaſe. He beheld the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of death with calmneſs, and expired with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a groan; appearing great in death as he had been in life.</p>
            <p>THE memory of a man poſſeſſed of ſuch uſeful and uncommon talents, and who devoted thoſe talents to the ſervice of the nation, will, I truſt, ever be held dear by the people of America. His great virtues and his ſplendid actions we ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to our children and they to theirs; and mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions yet unborn will "riſe and call him bleſſed." Every future return of this day will bring to mind <hi>the mighty man and the man of war, the prudent, the honorable man and the counſellor;</hi> and ſo long as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for true merit, ſo long as gratitude ſhall exiſt in the human mind, the memory of <hi>WASHINGTON</hi> will be dear to the country which, under the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Heaven, he raiſed to empire by his ſword, and eſtabliſhed in peaceful proſperity by his counſel.</p>

BUT, my hearers, ſimply to pronounce an eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy upon a departed friend is not the only way in which we ought to ſhow reſpect to his memory. In addition to this we ſhould imitate his virtues and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his wiſe counſels. Suffer me therefore again to preſent to your view the friend whoſe death we now lament, and to propoſe his example for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itation.</p>
            <p>FEW of us indeed ſhall ever be called to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand armies or to adminiſter civil government. Many of his great and ſplendid actions it will not therefore be in our power to imitate. Still we muſt endeavor to be actuated by principles ſimilar to thoſe which governed him, if like him we wiſh to leave a good name behind us.</p>
            <p>WE find him ever ready to obey the calls of duty, not ſuffering any conſiderations of private eaſe and convenience to reſtrain him. His courage was not that raſhneſs which ſometimes impels men to ruſh upon danger wholly regardleſs of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences: It was combined with coolneſs—with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion which led him to weigh well the probable iſſue of his conduct. Here we have an example worthy our imitation. Let a ſenſe of duty be the leading principle of our actions, and animate us ever to do what, upon due deliberation, we believe to be right. Let us learn to "think on our ways," to "ponder the paths of our feet," and with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trepidity encounter every danger to which we may be expoſed in the diſcharge of our duty. Let not

Deſpiſing <q>that popular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity which is raiſed without merit and loſt without a crime,</q> let us aim to ſecure <q>that applauſe which will ever be beſtowed on great and virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous actions.</q>

            <p>THE patriotiſm and public ſpiritedneſs of our deceaſed political father were ſhining traits in his character, which alſo we ſhould ſtrive to imitate. Free from that narrowneſs of mind which leads many people to confine all their regards to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, he felt for others, he loved his country, and devoted his whole time and energetic talents to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects which might benefit the nation and the world. His love to the country was real; it was not that noiſy ſhow of patriotiſm which leads many to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim much concerning the public good who are actuated only by a baſe ambition; and who are lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral of their cenſures of thoſe in office, merely from a wiſh to exalt themſelves upon the ruin of others. Often did the great patriot whoſe death we now la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſacrifice his private eaſe and intereſt to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the public good; and he manifeſted that he was entirely free from a ſelfiſh ambition to elevate himſelf and from an avaricious deſire to amaſs wealth at the expenſe of the public. Let thoſe who boaſt ſo much of their patriotiſm evince them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves equally free from ſelfiſh views, and we will allow the juſtice of their claims. My hearers, let
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:037430_0014_100D41D01BFB19E8"/>
all cultivate that love to our country which will ever lead us to be ſubmiſſive to its laws, to reſpect its rulers, and to aid them in the adminiſtration of government, inſtead of continually throwing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles in their way. And let us ever remember that good citizens will never ſeek redreſs for any ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed injuries except in a legal and conſtitutional manner.</p>
            <p>WE may, in the next place, view the farmer of Mount Vernon in his private life. <q>He was a man of the ſtricteſt honor and honeſty, fair and honorable in his dealings, and punctual to his engagements. His diſpoſition was mild, kind and generous. Candor, ſincerity, moderation and ſimplicity were prominent features in his character. He was an affectionate huſband, a faithful friend, a humane maſter and a father to the poor. He lived in the unvarying habits of regularity, temperance and induſtry.</q>

            <p>IT is too commonly the caſe that men who dazzle the world by the ſplendor of their public actions, who are diſtinguiſhed for martial courage or political wiſdom, are deficient in private virtues. Tho great in public, in private they manifeſt a want of true magnanimity, by indulging pride, oppreſſion, injuſtice, anger, ill-nature and exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive gratifications. When the world at large is look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them they will try to appear great and honorable; but when viewed only by the domeſtic circle they appear even mean and contemptible.

Not ſo the truly dignified <hi>WASHINGTON.</hi> In the peaceful walks of private life he appeared amiable, as he did great when at the head of armies, or when preſiding over the government of a nation.</p>
            <p>IT is in theſe private virtues more particularly that we ſhould view him as an example, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to imitate him. Theſe virtues have more real influence on human happineſs than thoſe ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did actions which aſtoniſh the world. They may not give a man ſo high a degree of celebrity, but they yield an internal peace more truly grateful than the applauſes of a misjudging world. Let us then ſedulouſly cultivate and practiſe that honeſty and generoſity, that candor and ſincerity, that mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and ſelf-government, that temperance and attention to the domeſtic virtues which were exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified in the life of the American CINCINNATUS.</p>
            <p>WHILE thus attentive to all the ſocial virtues, he was not unmindful of the duties of religion. Tho his avocations were numerous, yet <q>in his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotments for the revolving hours of the day reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was not forgotten. Feeling, what he ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten publicly acknowledged, his entire depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on GOD, he daily, at ſtated ſeaſons, retired to his cloſet, to worſhip at his footſtool, and to aſk his divine bleſſing. He was remarkable for his ſtrict obſervation of the ſabbath, and exemplary in his attendance on public worſhip.</q>

WHATEVER other endowments a man may poſſeſs, if deſtitute of all regard for religion,—if entirely inattentive to what he owes to GOD, he is deficient in that which gives real worth and dignity to man. Without goodneſs there can be no true greatneſs; and without religion there can be no true goodneſs. A becoming veneration for the character of JEHOVAH, a reverence for his word and inſtitutions, and a ſincere obedience to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, in addition to the practice of thoſe duties which reſult from our reſpective ſtations in life, are neceſſary to complete a perfect character.—Theſe are alſo neceſſary to render us acceptable to that GOD without whoſe approbation we muſt be miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable however applauded by the world. To the duties of religion, as preſcribed in the volume of divine revelation, let us carefully attend. Let us cheriſh that "fear of the LORD which is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of wiſdom," and reject with abhorrence thoſe falſe principles which teach that an individual or a nation may be great without religion. I will cloſe this branch of my ſubject with an extract from the addreſs of our late illuſtrious Chief to his fellow-countrymen, when he declined a re-election to the chief magiſtracy.</p>

               <q>OF all the diſpoſitions and habits which lead to political proſperity, religion and morality are indiſpenſible ſupports.

The merely politician, equally with the pious man ought to reſpect and to cheriſh them. A volume could not trace all their connections with private and public felicity. And let us with caution indulge the ſuppoſition, that morality can be maintained without religion. Whatever may be conceded of the influence of a refined education on minds of a peculiar ſtructure, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in excluſion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious principle.</q>

            <p>THUS, my hearers, have I endeavored to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to your view ſome outlines of a character de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly dear to the people of America; and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend his example to your imitation, as the moſt proper way of paying reſpect to his memory. I have not aimed to pleaſe the imagination by the charms of novelty, or to intereſt the feelings by the flights of fancy. I have, in a plain manner, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to you a character which you have long eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed; and if what I have ſaid ſhall induce any to ſeek to imitate him in his virtues, my higheſt am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition will be gratified. A few reflections, by way of improvement, will cloſe this diſcourſe.</p>

               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:037430_0018_100D41D8A6F5ADB8"/>
IN the firſt place, We are led from our text to acknowledge and adore the hand of GOD in the life and death of men who are diſtinguiſhed for their talents, and who are made bleſſings to a nation. "The LORD reigneth, let the earth rejoice." Whenever in the courſe of his Providence, he hath any great deſign to accompliſh he qualifies men for the purpoſe. And when his deſigns are anſwered <hi>he taketh way the mighty man and the man of war, the prudent, the honorable man, and the Counſellor.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſuch men are removed at periods when their continuance in life ſeems neceſſary for the happineſs of millions. Thus does GOD teach us that vain is the help of man, and that our help ſtandeth alone in him in whom is everlaſting ſtrength. Let us ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſively bow to his will, and devoutly commend ourſelves and our country to his merciful protection.</p>
            <p>SECONDLY, While we humble ourſelves under the late frown of divine Providence, let us be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grateful to GOD for ſo long continuing to us the important life and beneficial labors of the great and good man who has been lately taken from us. There were many periods when, to human appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, his removal would have been a greater ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity to this nation; nay when our very exiſtence as a nation ſeemed to depend upon the preſervation of his life. He lived to conduct his country to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence and empire; he lived to aſſiſt in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of its excellent conſtitution, to preſide over its government for ſeveral years, and to give an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to his ſucceſſors in office of the manner in
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:037430_0019_100D2F27391864E0"/>
which the duties of that high ſtation ſhould be filled, to inſure peace, proſperity and happineſs to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That he was thus long preſerved to us mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its our gratitude to him "by whom kings reign and princes decree juſtice."</p>
            <p>LASTLY, The mournful occaſion of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent meeting leads us to reflect upon the vanity of human grandeur, the vanity of all earthly things. GOD alone is truly great, becauſe he changeth not. Man is continually changing: "At his beſt eſtate he is altogether vanity. His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth: in that very day his thoughts periſh; and wherein is he to be accounted of?" However dignified in character, however uſeful to others, he muſt yield to the ſceptre of death. "No man hath power over the ſpirit to retain the ſpirit; neither hath he power in the day of death; and there is no diſcharge in that war." The rich and the poor, the high and the low muſt all crumble to the ſame undiſtinguiſhed duſt. When the hour of death ſhall come, all earthly grandeur will be found to be vain. It will be of no avail to have acquired the greateſt riches, if deſtitute of a treaſure in the heavenly world: It will be of no avail to have the honor which cometh from man if deſtitute of that which cometh from GOD. Therefore, my brethren, let us be ſolicitous above all things to ſeek an intereſt in him who is "the reſurrection and the life," who died to redeem from ſin and miſery all who ſhall believe in him. Let us aim to ſerve GOD and our
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:037430_0020_100D41DD05E0DE18"/>
generation faithfully, and "do with all our might whatever our hands ſhall find to do," remembering that "there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wiſdom in the grave whither we are haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing."</p>
