            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>IT has frequently given Pain to every Well-Wisher of his Country, when it has been observed, that in many of our public Assemblies, Party-Zeal, instead of Public-Good, has evidently biased the Minds of those who have constituted these Assemblies. Sensible of the pernicious Tendency of such Divisions, both with Respect to our Transactions here (the Importance, of whose Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, requires the coolest, calmest Deliberation) and to the Advantage it may give our Enemies abroad, I am induced, as a Friend to the Liberties of America, to offer my Mite to the public Fund; and well shall I consider it applied, if any Man is thereby enabled to divest himself of that Prejudice which, to our Shame and Dishonour it is spoken, has long held us in the worst of Slavery. The great Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of an Union amongst ourselves has been Theme of many a Patriot: All assent to the Truth of the Proposition, and yet, strange as it may appear, but few act as if influenced by what their Judgments seem to approve. To show the <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi> Necessity of <hi>Unanimity,</hi> at this Period, is the Intention of the present Address. You need not be informed, my Fellow Citizens, that <hi>Fifty-one</hi> Gentlemen were by this City appointed, to be a Committee, to correspond with the Committees of our Sister-Colonies; to inform them of the Transactions of this Province, and to advise upon Means, the most proper to be pursued, in the present critical Situation of our Liberties. This they have faithfully performed. It has been agreed to by the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Colonies, that a Congress ought to be held of Delegates from each Province, in order, <hi>unitedly,</hi> to point out the Way in which we, Hand in Hand, should walk. Deputies in several Places have been appointed, and various Modes, by which to choose ours, proposed. The Mode, which admits of fewest Objections, is that, without Controversy, by which the most unexceptionable Persons would be chosen; by which Confusion would be avoided, and the Inhabitants satisfied.</p>
            <p>Since our provincial Assembly could not be convened, what Body, my Brethren, can be more fit to nominate Persons to represent you, in the grand political Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, than that, in whose Hands you have already intrusted very important Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns? They have accordingly nominated for your Approbation five Persons; Men, whose Characters are unexceptionable; whose Abilities shine with unsullied Lustre, and whose Love for their Country, and Regard to its Liberties, cannot be doubted.
<list>
                  <item>ISAAC LOW,</item>
                  <item>JOHN ALSOP,</item>
                  <item>JOHN JAY,</item>
                  <item>PHILIP LIVINGSTON, and</item>
                  <item>JAMES DUANE,</item>
               </list>
are the Gentlemen thus nominated, Men known to you all, and, no Doubt, by all approved.—Let us, my Countrymen, prove by our Conduct, on Thursday next, when the public Approbation of these Persons will be asked, that we are actuated by a real Regard to our Liberties—that Party-Spirit, the Bane of public Virtue, no longer influences us—that we are united as one Body, informed by one honest Soul.—Let us not disapprove of those, of whom cool, dispassionate Reason must approve: and by our Disunion give an Evidence to the World, that our Strife is not, who will do his Country most Service (which indeed should be our only Contention) but who, with the greatest Virulence, will serve his Party.—If we are divided, my Brethren, in the Choice of our Delegates, the Body, of which they are to be Members, will be the less perfect; its Resolutions will not be judged so obligatory on each Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; nor will its Determinations be considered by our Enemies, as the Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of America.—</p>
            <p>Tell me, my Countrymen, what Delegates can we require, if not Men of <hi>Probi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Patriotism.</hi> These Qualities are universally allowed to be possessed by the Persons whom your Committee have chosen, and by your Confirmation of their Choice, you will prove yourselves Friends to <hi>Probity,</hi> to <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and your <hi>Country.</hi>
