         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and abandon the veſſel to the mercy of the waves. The Heavens were ſoon filled with flaſhes of light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; thick darkneſs ſucceeded day; the thunder rolled, and the veſſel, the ſport of all the various revolutions of the boiſterous waves, preſented only to the unfortunate paſſengers ſhipwreck or death; this ſoon followed, for the point of a rock forcing an entrance into the veſſel, in a few minutes, precipitated it into the boſom of the vaſt ocean. In this moment of danger, the Colonel, ever calm and collected, ſeized a plank, upon which he committed himſelf to the waves: his example was followed by a few others, and by his faithful domeſtic Peter.</p>
            <p>Having long floated at random, and contended with the fury of the waves, the Colonel found himſelf near land; but ſuch was the violence of the ſea, that at the moment his hopes were ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, he was frequently carried by an overwhelming wave to the greateſt diſtance: at length, after va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>orts, he gained a coaſt covered with rocks, over which he with difficulty climbed to an exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive plain, where he ſunk down, wholly deprived of ſenſation. In this ſtate he remained nearly two hours, when his ſenſes by degrees returning,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:035098_0005_1000B5B16CDBB038"/>
he diſcovered two children, half-naked, on their knees, at his ſide, who, by their innocent geſtures, expreſſed the moſt lively intereſt in his ſituation. One of them perceiving that he breathed, exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in a jargon he could juſt diſtinguiſh to be Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, "He is not dead, ſiſter; he is come to take <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s home—are you not father?"</p>
            <p>His firſt queſtions were, "Where am I? What country do you inhabit?" But finding that he was not clearly underſtood, he looked round for ſome perſon to whom he might addreſs himſelf. Not ſeeing any one, he attempted to riſe; but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted with fatigue, ſunk down, uttering invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary ſighs and groans, forced from him by the weakneſs of his condition.</p>
            <p>"He is hungry, brother," ſaid one of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, "I will go and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>etch him ſome food;" and immediately ſhe fled acroſs the plain.</p>
            <p>"Who do you belong to?" ſaid the Colonel, recovering himſelf, "have you no friends? no father, no mother?"</p>
            <p>"Are not you our father?" aſked the boy.</p>
            <p>"I! my child," ſaid the Colonel, "I do not know you."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:035098_0006_1000A3171881BE20"/>
"Will you not then love us?" ſaid the child.</p>
            <p>"Yes; but are you alone?"</p>
            <p>"O yes," returned he, "we are all alone; nobody but Eleanor and Ambroſe; we ſee only the great beaſts, and they frighten us very much."</p>
            <p>"And who brought you into this country, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe?" ſaid the Colonel.</p>
            <p>"A great houſe," replied the child, "that went <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on the water."</p>
            <p>"And have you never ſeen one like it touch here?"</p>
            <p>"O never," ſaid the child; "there are only great men, all black, that come ſometimes in little boats. When we ſee them we hide ourſelves for ſear they ſhould eat us."</p>
            <p>"Well!" ſaid the Colonel with a ſigh, "I am then loſt without reſource! I muſt end my days here, far from my wife, my friends, my country."</p>
            <p>"You will ſtay with us, will you not?" ſaid the boy.</p>
            <p>"Alas, my child! I have no choice."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:035098_0007_1000B5B397A3AA90"/>
"Oh," returned he, "we will love and careſs you, as we uſed to do Derley."</p>
            <p>"Derley! who was he?"</p>
            <p>"Our good friend," anſwered the child; "but he is dead; we have wept a great deal for him." As he ſaid this, his ſiſter returned with ſome tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toiſe and colibri eggs; ſhe brought alſo ſome dates and a large ſhell filled with a liquor, which to the taſte ſeemed that which flows from the palm tree. This ſimple repaſt proved very ſalutary to the Colonel; his ſtrength returned, he thanked his little hoſts for their ſolicitude, and reflecting a-new upon his adventure was aſtoniſhed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it poſſible that two children, ſo young and ſo delicate, ſhould provide for all their wants at an age when others ſcarcely know how to walk or think: he wiſhed to diſcover by what means it had been effected, but they expreſſed their ideas very imperfectly; he could only gueſs at their little jargon, and judge from it that they were Engliſh. He reſolved, nevertheleſs, while he awaited the return of day, to interrogate them, that he might, from their anſwers, form ſome conjectures upon their condition, and the cauſe of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:035098_0008_1000A31A59639688"/>
their being deſerted at ſo early an age. "How old are you?" ſaid he. "We do not underſtand you," replied Ambroſe; but when he repeated, "I aſk how many times you have ſeen the cold and hot ſeaſons?" Eleanor ſaid, "We cannot tell; but ſince the time our good friend died, we have at every ſun made a mark with a ſtone on that great tree you ſee there. The Colonel ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited the ingenious expedient the children had employed, and going toward the tree, by the light of the moon added all the marks, and counted 1528, which made four years two months and eight days ſince they had loſt Derley. "But," ſaid he, "did he die as ſoon as you came here?"</p>
            <p>"O yes," replied the children, "his blood ſlowed like the ſpring at which we drink."</p>
            <p>"He was wounded then?" ſaid the Colonel.</p>
            <p>"Very much," they replied.</p>
            <p>"But," ſaid the Colonel, "who brought you hither in the wooden houſe?"</p>
            <p>"Mama, with a great many men; one of them was a very bad man; he beat Derley, and gave him a great many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uts with a knife, and
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:035098_0009_1000B5B52364E9C0"/>
then put him with us into a little boat that brought us here."</p>
            <p>"And do you," ſaid the Colonel, "recollect where you lived before you went into this ſhip? (for the wooden houſe you ſpeak of is called a ſhip.)"</p>
            <p>"Yes, in great houſes, where there were many fine things; then we uſed to ſee our dear father ſometimes, and he uſed to kiſs and love us."</p>
            <p>"And was your father in the ſhip?" ſaid the Colonel.</p>
            <p>"No; before we went into it, he and mama <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> very much; and then we ſaw him no more."</p>
            <p>"In what place," ſaid the Colonel, "was the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>eat houſe in which you lived?"</p>
            <p>"In a place where there were a great many others," replied Ambroſe. "Do you remember, ſiſter, that a woman uſed to carry us often into a fine garden, where there was a great river, and roads of trees, where fine women and men uſed to walk, while we played upon the graſs with little girls and boys?"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:035098_0010_1000B5B7E7C1A878"/>
"Yes," ſaid Eleanor, "I remember it very well."</p>
            <p>From theſe anſwers the Colonel could draw little information; all that he conjectured was that his little hoſts were the victims of ſome ſort of treachery, and that Derley was their friend; and he thought it poſſible that the fine garden of which they ſpoke might be St. James's Park; but all this was not ſufficiently clear; he hoped that time, by ſtrengthening their reaſon, would afford him a more ſatisfactory explanation.</p>
            <p>No ſooner had the morning ſun inflamed the horizon, than he aroſe, and taking the young pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pils of Nature, who were henceforth to be his own, by the hand, ſet out to take a view of the land which Providence had deſtined, for ſome time at leaſt, to be his abode. He diſcovered that it was an iſland, ſurrounded by ſteep rocks, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſible only on one ſide to veſſels; it was not very extenſive, but was covered with mountains, woods, little hills, and cool and fragrant valleys; here an embowering ſoreſt invited the traveller to taſte in its religious incloſure the ſweets of ſolitude: there a mountain ſlowly riſing, covered with fern, diſcovered from its top an extenſive ocean, ſtrewed

with an infinity of little iſlands, which appeared only like the points of ſo many rocks. Farther on a ſpring of water eſcaped trembling from the hollow of a cave, and ran meandering over beds of reeds to water a ſmiling plain, enamelled with all the various beauties of vegetation. A thouſand ſucculent vegetables and blooming flowers, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand fruits and odoriferous trees, contended for the ſhade and land; the cocoa, the caſia, the palm and the banana tree, the leaves of which were, according to the Indians, the veſtments of our firſt parents; the fig, the white cotton tree, in a word, all the moſt curious and uſeful productions of America. No traces of men were, however, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, but thoſe of different animals, ſuch as otters, flags, goats, and the anta, a ſmall animal which reſembles the elephant, though much ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and is common to Peru.

            <p>"But you had not always ſtrength to do ſo," ſaid the Colonel.</p>
            <p>"No," replied Eleanor, "it is only ſince the dry weather that Ambroſe thought of it. O me! before we were not tall enough, and we only eat the fruits that the trees let fall, or ſome eggs that the great fiſh brought to the ſide of the water: but we are near our cabin; come, in father, you ſhall ſee it; take care you do not hurt your head." It was' a kind of ſubterraneous cave, at which the arrived through a deep valley, overgrown with palm-trees. The Colonel readily entered; but was inſtantly alarmed by a faeted ſmell, that nearly ſtifled him: he advanced to diſcover the cauſe; but what was his horror and aſtoniſhment, when, at the further part of the cave, he ſaw a disfigured corpſe! it was partly dry, and partly putrified and was covered with different aromatic leaves "Do not be freightened," ſaid Eleanor, obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the impreſſion it made upon the Colonel, "it is he!"</p>

"He! my child, who!" "Poor Derley," ſhe replied, "who fell dead in this corner."—"And have you, my children," ſaid the Colonel, "inhabited a cavern where—" "Oh, we never left it," interrupted Eleanor, "that we might be always with him." "Yes," ſaid Ambroſe, "we look at him every ſun, and cover him with freſh leaves." "Good creatures!" exclaimed the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel; "but, my little friends, he can no longer hear you." "Oh! we know very well," ſaid Ambroſe, "that he cannot hear us; for if he could, he would ſpeak to us, but we would not part with him for all that." "But, my dear chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren," ſaid the Colonel, "you expoſe yourſelves to the danger of becoming ſick, and dying like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe."</p>
            <p>"Ah," ſaid Ambroſe, having remained thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a moment, "once as we were looking at Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, Eleanor's face turned quite white, and ſhe fell upon the ground. I thought ſhe was going to die; for I called, and ſhe did not anſwer me; Eleanor I ſaid, my dear Eleanor, will you leave Ambroſe all alone? but ſhe did not ſpeak. Then I turned to the Sun, and begged he would give me back Eleanor, or burn me with his fire. He heard me, for ſhe got up and walked."</p>

"Not the Sun, my child," ſaid the Colonel, but God heard you."</p>
            <p>"God! who is God?" "That Great Being, my child," ſaid the Colonel, "who has placed you upon the earth; who watches over you, who has miraculouſly preſerved your life: but I ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain this hereafter, at preſent we muſt think of tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hence this inanimate corpſe."</p>
            <p>"Oh, no," exclaimed the children at the ſame inſtant. "Suffer me to remove it," ſaid the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, "I know where God would have it put."</p>
            <p>"Pray, pray," ſaid Eleanor, holding her little hands towards him, "do not take it away: we ſhall die if we do not ſee poor Derley."</p>
            <p>By dint of argument and entreaty, the Colonel, however, at length prevailed; he drew from them a reluctant conſent, and drawing the corpſe of the unfortunate Derley from the cavern, he began to examine it, hoping to form from it ſome concluſions relative to the fate of the two little ſtrangers.

            <p>"You have never then ſearched him?" ſaid the Colonel."</p>

            <p>"What reſpectful tenderneſs!" exclaimed the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel. His thoughts then reverted to the interment of the corpſe.

To this ſpot he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately repaired, and having with a branch of the Biſchalo, the hard wood of which the negroes uſe for the conſtruction of their cabins, dug a grave, he depoſited in it the remains of the unfortunate Derley, while his two little friends beheld the mournful ceremony bathed in tears.</p>
            <p>He then ſtruck fire from a neighbouring rock, a wonder which much ſurpriſed the children, and burnt upon the grave the clothes of the deceaſed, adding a quantity of mint, cloves, and other fragrant herbs that grew near, to purify the air.

lingering glance towards a ſpot which contained in their eyes an ineſtimable treaſure. They walked—ſtopped—walked—and would again retrace the ſame ſteps to bid an eternal adieu to their good friend.</p>
            <p>In the mean while t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Arriving on the ſhore, the Colonel ſtopped to admire the glories of the ſcene, and the children, forgetting their grief, walked hand in hand toward the rocks, and amuſed themſelves with collecting ſhells and ſea-weeds.

Saying this, ſhe led him among the rocks, where they found Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe attentively examining ſomething which the Colonel ſoon diſcovered to be a large bundle of ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocks which the returning tide had driven on ſhore. This ſuggeſting to him the idea of recovering from the wreck ſome articles that might ſoften the ſeverity of his misfortune, an idea which had not till this moment occurred to him, he began to ſearch diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

The other which was the carpenter's cheſt, contained a variety of different tools, and was conſidered by the Colonel as a greater treaſure than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Then ſeating himſelf with his young companions on the ſea beech, he ſhared with them a meal of which hunger made the chief dainty: and he was not a little diverted to ſee them, with ſparkling eyes, palate the flavor of meats, the reliſh of which they had long loſt, and tenderly incite each other to partake of a feaſt which to them appeared delicious.</p>

"You do not eat, brother," ſaid Eleanor; "nor you, ſiſter," returned Ambroſe; and then they both fell greedily upon their meats, which preſently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared. Their good friend ſmiled; and congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulated himſelf upon the power of contributing to their happineſs. The repaſt being ended, they all three repaired to the cavern where Ambroſe and Eleanor ſoon ſell aſleep. It was not ſo with their friend: a thouſand painful reflections kept him long from taſting the ſame refreſhment. He could not forbear contraſting his ſituation and proſpects the preceeding day with thoſe of the preſent moment. What a change had a few hours wrought! Fluſhed with hope he was returning to his country to enjoy with a wife and child whom he tenderly loved, all the conveniencies and the elegancies of life. He now ſaw himſelf the ſolitary inhabitant of an unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented tract, obliged to renounce his wife, his friends, all he held dear. Theſe reflections, in ſpite of his fortitude, bedewed his cheek with tears; but when he c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="22" facs="unknown:035098_0020_1000B5C2CD5CD660"/>
committed his fate into his hands. His thoughts then turned upon his little companions in whoſe f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>te it was impoſſible not to be intereſted, abandoned to themſelves on an uninhabited iſland, at the early age of three years and a half; for the marks upon the great tree forming four years two months and eight days, the whole amounted to no more than ſeven years, two months and eight days. Their preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, he thought, could have been effected by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle leſs than a miracle, and viewing them as the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſignally pointed at by Providence in his ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreck, he reſolved henceforth to be to them a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, guide, and friend.</p>
            <p>The riſing ſun awoke him from a ſhort repoſe, and he looked round to ſalute his fellow-citizens; but he was ſurpriſed to find that they had left the cave: at firſt he concluded they would ſoon return, but an hour nearly elapſing, he grew alarmed and having ſought them without ſucceſs in the cave they had formerly inhabited, he repaired to the ſea-ſhore which he traverſed in the utmoſt anxiety, calling them repeatedly by name. He knew not what to think, and began to form a thouſand horrid conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures concerning wild beaſts, that for any thing he knew to the contrary, might inhabit the iſland,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:035098_0021_1000A332181E1280"/>
when the idea occurred to him that they might be at the place where Derley was interred. To this ſpot their affectionate hearts had in truth conducted them; he met them returning through the wood, their eyes ſtill wet with the tears they had ſhed upon the grave of their friend. The Colonel chid them gently for the alarm they cauſed him, and taking them by the hand, "I am pleaſed my little friends," ſaid he, as they walked through the wood, "with the gratidude and affection you diſcover towards your unfortunate good friend; it convinces me that your hearts are good; nevertheleſs you muſt ceaſe to regret him; God has, I doubt not, taken him from you to bellow on him a happineſs that nothing can interrupt.</p>
            <p>"How is that, father?" ſaid the children, "we do not underſtand you."</p>
            <p>"I will explain it to you, my little friends," ſaid the Colonel, "I ought to do ſo, but neceſſity engages me at preſent to defer this duty. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not inhabit the gloomy cave we now occupy; we muſt endeavor to conſtruct a more agreeable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat; a cabin that will ſhelter us from the injuries of the air, and ſerve us as an aſylum againſt all alarms. The children were delighted; they jumpt

round their good friend, exclaiming in an extacy, "We will help you, father! we will help you!' He reſolved, however, before he began his opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to viſit the rocks, judging that the influx of the tide might, during the night, have brought other articles from the wreck on ſhore. Nor was he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; he found a caſk of oil, a ſecond <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>Having ſecured theſe new treaſures, he turned his thoughts upon the grand work of conſtructing a cabin, between two hills that roſe near the ſea coaſt, was a cool valley, in the midſt of which a ſpring of water, guſhing from a rock, formed a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin, bordered with a thouſand odoriferous flowers.

extent of the ocean, and on the other by an embow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring foreſt. Here, at the entrance of the foreſt, the colonel reſolved to erect his new habitation, and with this deſign collecting the precious inſtruments he had taken from the wreck, hewed two of thoſe trees called Biſchalos, and ſhaped four ſtakes fifteen inches thick, and eight long; theſe he drove into the earth at the diſtance of twenty feet from each other, planting between each ſix ſmaller: this done, he filled the intermediate ſpace with flints, cementing the whole with a whitiſh ſort of earth, very much reſembling that in Europe called marne, and which mixed with water formed a cement to which the rays of the ſun ſoon gave a hardneſs equal to ſtone. He did not forget previouſly to leave in this little edifice a door, narrow, that he and his companions might the better defend themſelves, in caſe of an attack, againſt the wild beaſts. A large chimney was alſo formed, and two windows to eſtabliſh a current of air neceſſary in ſo confined a place occupied by three perſons. The l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

length, cedil;alling to mind the manner in which the Africans roof their dwellings, he placed ſeven or eight joiſts horizontally upon the building, and then having raiſed others into a point, he formed the whole into a carcaſs, with tenons and mortices, and covered it with the leaves of the palm-tree in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven into a ſort of mat, in the manner of the negroes on the gold coaſt: he next made a partition, which ſeparated the interior of the cabin into two parts, and formed for Eleanor a little chamber, about eight feet ſquare, the entrance of which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated with that which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

At the end of a month the little edifice was completed, and all that he had gained from the wreck, cheſts, tools, linen, clothes, &amp;c. conveyed into it: as for beds, he made three very commodious of ſome hammocks, ſpread with mats compoſed of palm leaves dried in the ſun. The chimney concealed his kitchen utenſils, which were hung upon hooks, driven into the wall for that purpoſe: in ſhort, every thing was complete, and the Colonel and his little friends took poſſeſſion of their new habitation.

<pb n="23" facs="unknown:035098_0026_1000A3339AB72C20"/>
removed all the furniture, and then returning, again threw themſelves into his arms. The Colonel made them, at length, ſit down, recommended ſilence, and ſpoke to them in theſe terms. "It is time, my children that I think of the great work to which God has appointed me; that of your education: the forming of your hearts will not, I think, coſt me much trouble; they are good and ſuſceptible: with reſpect to your intellects, I believe them to be ſound and comprehenſive, but I ſhall form a better judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when I am more particularly acquainted with the manner in which you have conducted yourſelves ſince your reſidence in this iſland: it is neceſſary, therefore, Ambroſe, before I detail to you my plans, that you recount to me in the moſt exact manner that your memory will permit, what you did upon firſt coming out of the ſhip that brought you hither, and acquaint me with the means you have employed ſince that time to preſerve your exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and to provide for all your wants: arrange your ideas, my child, as well as you are able, and do not omit the moſt trivial circumſtance; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail will be more intereſting to me than you may ſuppoſe."</p>
            <p>The Colonel ceaſed, and Ambroſe, who du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:035098_0027_1000B5CBCB20C140"/>
a month had learned to reflect a little, and to expreſs his ideas in a more intelligent manner, was ſilent a few minutes to recollect himſelf, and then gave, without interruption, the following re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cital.</p>
            <p>"We lived, as we told you, father; in a wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en houſe that went upon the water: we had ſlept in it a great many times, and every morning Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley uſed to come and take us up, and carry us to mama, who uſed to kiſs us and cry, this made us cry too. Once as ſhe was kiſſing us and crying, a man came into the cabin, and talked a great deal to her: it was that naughty man I told you of: mama cried very much, and would have taken us in her arms, but he took us away from her and threw us upon the ground. Then Derley was very angry, and ſeized that naughty man by the throat, but he drew a very long great knife, and run it into his belly. Then ſeveral ugly men came in, and put us and Derley into a little boat, that went upon the water much faſter than the wooden houſe. Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley groaned very much, and we were all covered with his blood; but the men in the boat laughed, and ſet us all three upon this land, father. Then
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:035098_0028_1000A337056B2560"/>
Derley fell down, and lay along time upon the ground: at laſt he got up very ſoftly, and took us by the hand, and walked to the cave, where you know we lived, father, till you came; but as ſoon as he got in he fell down again, and dragged us upon him. We cried, and ſpoke to him, but he did not anſwer, he only groaned. He groaned all night, and we cried, and when the ſun came again, he breathed no more. We took him by the hands, but they were quite cold; then we ſpoke to him again, but finding he did not anſwer, we went out of the cave, crying, and running about up on the ſea-ſhore. Eleanor ſoon fell down; I ran to her, and fell too, for I felt as if I was going to fall aſleep. While we were ſitting, a goat paſſed by with a young one ſacking: at that moment it came into my mind to drive away the young one, and ſuck ſome of the milk; ſo drawing myſelf under the goat, the good creature let me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

to Derley," ſhe replied: ſo we took her by the horn, and led her to the cave, the young one follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the way. Still Derley did not ſpeak, ſo we began again to cry, and call him: Derley!!' we ſaid, "Derley, ſpeak to us, are you angry? we will do ſo no more. Anſwer us, Derley, it is Ambroſe, it is Eleanor; do you not love us?" Our uneaſineſs encreaſed every inſtant, we were ſo happy with mama! and now we were in a frightful cave, all dark! This made us on a ſudden thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; we ceaſed crying, and looked at each other, without ſpeaking or ſtirring at all. In this time we forgot our goat, till ſeeing ſhe was gone, we run out of the cave to ſeek her. In our way ſomething fell from a hightree as we paſſed it, and frightened us very much; we ran away as faſt as we could, but at laſt venturing to look back, and ſeeing nothing to alarm us, we returned on tip toe, to ſee what had fallen from the tree, and found a fruit ſhaped like a very large green pear: I was ſo hungry, that I could not help taſting it, and found that it was very good: ſo I gave it to Eleanor, who eat half, and left me the reſt. We then went again in ſearch of the goat, but ſeeing as we paſſed, a great tree that water came out of it, being very dry, I put my mouth to the tree, and ſucked ſome. Eleanor did
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:035098_0030_1000A33AA0FCFDF8"/>
the ſame, and we both thought it was much better than the water we had before drank. At laſt, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we ſhould not find the gentle beaſt which had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us her milk, we went back to the cave, which we were a long time in finding. The ſight of our good friend made us again cry very much, till no longer ſeeing any light, we fell upon the ground, and ſlept till a new ſun. When we awoke, we kiſſed Derley, and being very hungry, ran to the tree at the foot of which we had found the great pear; but there were no pears; ſo we run to the ſea-ſhore, crying, and repeating the prayers mama uſed to make us ſay morning and night. "O, Eleanor, do you remember how frightened we were!" There was a great beaſt upon the ſands, juſt like a ſpider; Eleanor, who ſaw it firſt, ſcream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, and taking me by the hand, ran to our cave, where we hid ourſelves; for we thought the great beaſt was coming after us. We ſtaid there till the heat of the day, crying and ſcreaming dreadfully; but finding it did not follow us, we grew calm, and I began to think of the great pear which had frightened us, and afterwards proved ſo good: ſo I ſaid to Eleanor, "Let us go and ſee if the great beaſt is there." "Ah!" ſhe replied, "it will eat us." "No," ſaid I, "if it wants to eat us, I
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:035098_0031_1000B5D016611870"/>
will throw a great ſtone, and kill it."—Eleanor conſented, and we went ſoftly to the place where we had ſeen it, and in its room found ſeveral yellow eggs. We did not much like the looks of them, but I was ſo hungry, that I ſoon took courage to break one, and Eleanor and I ſwallowed them one after another, and found them nicer than the eggs we had eaten with mama. It was very lucky, father, that we found them, for we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> as if we ſhould fall and die for want of food; but after we had eaten the eggs we grew ſtrong again, and began to ſpeak of what had happened to us. Still we called upon Derley, hoping in time to awake him, and at laſt got ſo weary and ſick, that we lay ourſelves down to ſleep till another ſun. This too we ſpent in crying, and ſeeking food. A very pretty little bird, with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

We divided them, and at the ſame time, I ſaw ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the ground two of the ſame large apples which had before f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>llen from the tree. "Here, ſiſter," ſaid I, "is one for you and one for me." We ate them, and then went to the tree which gave
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:035098_0032_1000B5D19C573FC0"/>
the water, and ſucked till we were no longer dry. In this manner, father, we lived for ſeveral ſuns, and were only ſorrowful when we entered the cave where poor Derley continued to ſleep without ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: ſtill we hoped he would wake, and a thought one ſun came into my head, as we ſtood on the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore, looking at the great fire which ſhines in the heavens. "What ſhall we do, ſiſter," ſaid I, "to count the ſuns Derley ſhall have ſlept, that we may tell him when he awakes?" We both thought a good while; but at laſt, Eleanor took a flint, and ſaid, "Let us make a ſtroke upon this great tree every time the ſun comes back to us; Derley knows how to read, and he will tell when he awakes." Since that time we have not paſſed one ſun without mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſtroke on the tree; you have read them, father, and know how many there be."</p>
            <p>Here the Colonel could no longer retain his admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: he embraced his two little friends, addreſsed ſome exclamations to heaven, and deſired Ambroſe to continue his recital, which he did in theſe words.—</p>
            <p>"We every day found food, and began to forget our griefs, when I thought to myſelf, if theſe trees ſhould not let fall any more apples, nor theſe birds
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:035098_0033_1000A33F2DFCC038"/>
their neſts; if thoſe great beaſts ſhould not bring us any more eggs, what muſt we do? We muſt try to get ſomething to eat, if all this ſhould happen. Then I took ſome ſtones, and threw them with all my ſtrengh at the trees, and a great many apples and neſts fell at our feet. Eleanor and I gathered them up, and carried them to the cave, where we hid them under ſome leaves of the ſame trees, which are very large. We did this every ſun, and were never in want of food; but ſometimes we were very much frightened indeed! for thoſe great beaſts you have ſeen, father, in the woods, would come by night almoſt into our cave; but we always hid ourſelves behind Derley, and they went away without biting us. One night there came a horſe that had a long neck, and a great lump upon its back; the ſight of it frightened us ſo much, that we fled out of the cave, and ran ſcreaming violently, till coming to a tree, I ſet my feet and hands againſt it, and graſping it it very cloſe, climbed quite to the top, calling to my ſiſter to do the ſame. She followed my exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the crooked horſe finding he could not get at us, went away directly, and when he was a good way off, we came down. Ah, father, we ſhould have been very glad, if we had known the ſecret

you have ſhewn us, of getting fire out of the ſtones, for we were ſometimes cold. Our clothes got torn, and when they were very bad, we threw them away, and for ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>"It is the ſkin of an otter," replied the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel. "Well, then," continued Ambroſe, "this country is full of theſe otters. We will try to get a ſkin for you when your coat is worn out.</p>
            <p>"Is this all that has happened, Ambroſe?" ſaid the Colonel. "Yes," ſaid Ambroſe, "all."—"But," returned the Colonel, "you have not yet ſpoken of the large black men you ſaw." "Oh," ſaid Ambroſe, "I forgot: in truth, we muſt take care of them." "Well," ſaid the Colonel, "but how came you to ſee them?" "Why," ſaid Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe, "one day when it was very bad weather, I left Eleanor in the cave, and went out to ſeek food, and when I came back, ſhe came running to me, quite frightened, crying, "we ſhall be eaten,—we ſhall be eaten—I have ſeen—" I aſked her what? "Great ugly black men," ſaid ſhe, "there—look—do you not ſee them?"—While ſhe was ſpeaking, I ſaw a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>id ourſelves at the bottom of it, very much terrified; but not hearing any thing, came out from time to time, to ſee if the black men were ſtill there: at laſt we did not ſee them at all, and running to the ſide from whence they came, we ſaw them a very great way off, in a little boat that went very faſt upon the water. They have been here ſince, but we ſaw no more of them than we did at firſt; they never come this way, it is only in the great gardens which you call woods, that we ſee them; when they are gone, we find large large animals there ſkinned, trees quite deſtroyed, and the feathers of birds, which makes us think that theſe black men come here to kill the beaſts, and to take the birds and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. This, father, is all I can recollect: we have lived, as I have told you, from the time you ſee the marks upon the tree, without doubt, through the goodneſs of the God whom you tell us of: till now we have ſaid the prayers mama taught us to the ſun, who walks in the heavens, thinking he was

God; but if you have another, we will pray to him, and be very good, that he may love us."</p>
            <p>Ambroſe ceaſed ſpeaking, and the Colonel was ſilent a few minutes, to admire the hand of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the preſervation of theſe innocents! The green pears of which they ſpoke, he found no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in judging to be Caraſols, a fruit common to North America; the great beaſt on the ſhore a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toiſe, the eggs of which are delicious, and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depoſited by this creature on the ſands: the bird with black and blue feathers, he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to be the colib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

At length, taking Ambroſe by the hand, "The deſire you expreſs, my ſon," ſaid he, "of knowing that powerful and beneficent Being, who has miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly preſerved you amidſt theſe deſerts, ſhall be gratified: too great to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

all men: nothing eſcapes him, he knows all, ſees all, hears all, and with a glance of his eye, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends the whole earth." "The earth!" inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Ambroſe, "do you mean the country where we live?" "The earth, my children, I need not tell you," ſaid the Colonel, "is the ground on which we tread, but it conſiſts not only of this iſland, it extends beyond the ſeas, and contains four great countries, which are called EUROPE, ASIA, AFRICA, and AMERICA, which laſt is the part of the world we are now in."</p>
            <p>"Then this Iſland," ſaid Ambroſe, "is Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica?"</p>
            <p>"No," replied the Colonel," but it makes a part of it."</p>
            <p>"We do not," ſaid the children, "underſtand you." "When you are further inſtructed," ſaid the Colonel, "when I ſhall have taught you to read and write, you will perfectly comprehend all this: at preſent it will be ſufficient to acquaint you that this great Being, who is called God, created all things: the Sun, which has hitherto been the object of your adoration, and which communicates light and heat to all nature, was formed by his

word: he has furniſhed the earth with thouſands of beautiful plants and animals: we can behold no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that does not ſpeak his praiſe and almighty power: to him, my children, you owe your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: his word called you into exiſtence, and his mercy renders that exiſtence a bleſſing: you muſt look up to him as the author of all good, and to pleaſe him, be humble, meek, and endeavour to imitate his perfections, by diffuſing happineſs to every creature around you."</p>
            <p>Ambroſe and Eleanor liſtened to this diſcourſe with an attention from which their friend drew the happieſt preſage: the day paſſed inſenſibly away; they ſupped in the new cabin, and afterward pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to occupy their hammocks. Eleanor buſied herſelf for ſome time about her chamber: ſhe walked in it a great while, and did not go to ſleep till ſhe had twenty times examined and changed the place of the little furniture it contained. The Colonel and Ambroſe, neighbours to each other, diſcourſed for ſome time: then reſigning themſelves to the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of ſleep, they enjoyed an uninterrupted repoſe. The riſing ſun at length enlightened the cabin, when the Colonel, finding that his pupils were ſtill bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in a profound ſleep, took them gently by the
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:035098_0039_1000B5D94F86C310"/>
hand, and with pleaſure ſaw them open their eyes, ſtretch firſt one arm, then the other, raiſe their heads, and ſmile on him with an inexpreſſible grace. "You ſhould give an example to your ſiſter, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe," ſaid he, "and be before hand with the Sun." "Forgive me, dear father," ſaid Ambroſe, but we have ſlept in ſuch a good bed!"</p>
            <p>"It is enough, my ſon," replied the Colonel, "but to-morrow, and every future day, you muſt at day-break repair both of you to the ſea ſhore, and o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of doing.</p>
            <p>Having erected and furniſhed his little dwelling, the Colonel was reſolved to viſit the interior part of the Iſland, that he might more particularly examine its vegetable productions, and execute the projects he had formed: he accordingly ſet out, and had not advanced far before he diſcovered plains covered with rice and maize, and manioque. Theſe were the principal objects of his purſuit: with the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the children, about two buſhels of maize was gathered, and conveyed in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to the cabin. Some handfuls of this was ſpread upon the
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:035098_0040_1000B5DB09854568"/>
turf, and expoſed to the ſcorching heat of noon, which ſoon dried it ſufficiently to grind. The Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel then made, in a rock, a hole in the form of a mortar, and with a peſtle of wood broke the grains, and reduced them to powder, It was then neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to winnow it, that the chaff might be ſeparated from the grain, and this he performed by ſhaking it violently in a cloth, which Ambroſe and Eleanor held extended: afterwards it was ground into flour between two ſtones, and diluted with water. A little brandy being mixed with this paſte, by way of leven, it was put to bake upon flints ſtrongly heated by the fire, and thus a bread, very light and agreeable to the palate, was made. While the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren watched the bread, the Colonel returned to make freſh diſcoveries: he found, as he proceeded into the iſland, a great deal of millet, but different from that of Europe, and fine potatoes, which he knew would afford them excellent nouriſhment; he diſcovered alſo ſome green figs, and a variety of wholeſome and delicious fruits common to America; but for theſe it was neceſſary to go far into the iſland, which became an inconvenience: to remedy it, therefore, with the aſſiſtance of his little pupils, he dug up and ſowed a piece of land, near the cabin,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:035098_0041_1000A34E52167670"/>
which extended from the ſea ſhore to the foreſt, which ſerved as its boundary. This ſort of orchard in the end, furniſhed them with maize, rice, millet, pota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes, and all the moſt uſeful and delicious productions of the ſoil.</p>
            <p>The Reader having now ſeen our iſlanders fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with the firſt neceſſaries of life, will not, perhaps be diſpleaſed to learn in what manner they employed their time. In the morning the Colonel took Ambroſe into the woods with him to hunt, having for this neceſſary purpoſe fabricated a bow about three feet and a half long, the ſtring of which was a gut twiſted, and the arrows a ſtick furniſhed with two feathers, and terminated by a flint ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened: with theſe they killed the different animals that inhabited the woods, ſuch as ſtags, goats, does, and among the birds, the duck and the foken, which furniſhed them with excellent food. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this time Eleanor was employed in baking the bread, or in other little offices of domeſtic econo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. On returning, they buſied themſelves in col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the eggs which were depoſited by different fiſh upon the ſea beach, but eſpecially by the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toiſe and alligator: the laſt mentioned is ſo ſingular that a ſhort deſcription of it may be deſerving the

attention of the Reader. The alligator is a ſort of crocodile common to America: its head is large, and its jaws furniſhed with ſtrong teeth, two of which eſpecially are extremely long; it has four legs, which are very ſhort, and terminate by large feet, and its back from the head to the tail is cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſtrong ſcales, as alſo two large lumps which are over the eyes; its ſtomach is furniſhed with four glands, and its tail always drags on the ground. This animal lives indifferently on land or water, and is not miſchievous but when provoked: its eggs are eſteemed a great dainty. The cultivation of their field next engaged the attention of the Colonel and his pupils, after which they dined, and ſpent the afternoon in ſtudy or in gardening.</p>
            <p>Nothing could exceed the attention of Ambroſe and Eleanor to the leſſons of their friend, who had found the means of teaching them, not only to read, but to write. He had diſcovered in the woods a tree much reſembling the fimpi of the Iſle of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagaſcar: its bark, after being expoſed to the ſun, became as white as paper, and though <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Indian fig-tree, the ſap of which is uſed by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians to colour their veſſels black. Being thus fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with paper and ink, he ſoon added pens; he ſhaped them with his knife, and put them into the hands of his young pupils, who were ſoon able to write and read, and conſequently to feel the value of thoſe books (for among them were ſome of the beſt authors) which had been taken from the wreck. "Pray, father," ſaid Ambroſe one day, laying down a book, "explain to me why they have kings in the countries I read of." "Men living in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, my ſon," ſaid the Colonel, "in which there are good and bad, it is neceſſary to eſtabliſh rulers, that order and peace may be maintained."</p>
            <p>"I do not underſtand you," ſaid Ambroſe.—"I will endeavor," replied his friend, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain myſelf more clearly; ſuppoſe, now, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, there were in this iſland a great many men and women who lived together in common, can you not conceive that one would wiſh for the field of his neighbour, that another would cut the throat of his enemy without pity; that this man would enter our cabin to ſeize upon our food, and that drive us from it to eſtabliſh his own reſidence in it?</p>

"How!' exclaimed the children with aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, "are men capable of this?'</p>
            <p>"I am aſhamed, my children," ſaid the Colonel, to reply that they are; and that, unfortunately, the number of the wicked ſurpaſs that of the good." "Ah, Eleanor," exclaimed Ambroſe, "let us ſtay in our iſle!"</p>
            <p>"Hear me to an end," interrupted the Colonel; "what I have ſaid granted, you will ſee that it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to eſtabliſh laws to render our habitations and property ſecure, and alſo to inveſt certain indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals with a power to enforce thoſe laws: this power is not, however, always inveſted in one man, but ſometimes in a certain number choſen by the body of the people; this form of government is called a republic; the other, where a king governs, a monarchy."</p>
            <p>"I comprehend very well what you ſay, father," ſaid Ambroſe, but is it not ſtrange that men ſhould be ſo wicked as to render theſe laws neceſſary?</p>
            <p>"It is a melancholy proof, my ſon," replied the Colonel, "of the depravity of human nature: from pride, envy, ambition, and avarice, vices, which are the more dangerous in community, as opportunities

            <p>"Pray, father, ſaid Ambroſe, "what is ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice?"</p>
            <p>"An inordinate deſire of poſſeſſing more than we can enjoy," ſaid the Colonel: "you will ſcarcely believe, my child, that there are beings who poſſeſs great wealth, and bury, without employing it."</p>
            <p>"In what, then," ſaid Ambroſe, conſiſts the riches of your country, father?"</p>
            <p>"Alas, my ſon!" returned the Colonel, "it is thoſe miſerable pieces of gold and ſilver which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute all the happine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

"Oh, I underſtand very well,' interrupted Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe, and I could willingly pardon them for ſelling the works of art; if one man is wiſer or more ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than another, he deſerves a recompence: but to aſſume a right over grain, wood, and all the common productions of the earth, that is indeed unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable."</p>
            <p>"You do not reflect, Ambroſe," ſaid the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, "that all theſe productions of the earth require culture, conveyance, and a thouſand little cares which equally deſerve reward: is the man who tills a field, ſows it, and watches the vegetation of its produce, who gathers and carries it afterward into cities, obliged to take upon himſelf this trouble?

"ELECTRICITY," continued the Colonel, "cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the vegetables to grow, agitates the air we breathe, drives the winds with more or leſs violence, penetrates our bodies, and gives them ſtrength, nay, health; fortifies, and even preſerves in us the vital principle; it ren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>"Above the Earth's orb is MARS, whoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from the Sun is a hundred and forty-four milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of miles; it travels at the rate of fifty five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand miles an hour, and goes round the Sun in ſomething leſs than two of our years.</p>

            <p>In this manner the Colonel began his aſtronomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal lectures. The two children looked up aſtoniſhed at the prodigious magnitude of thoſe globes he had been deſcribing, and were deſirous of travelling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the planets, eſpecially into Saturn, whoſe ring and five moons aſtoniſhed them; but when in due time their worthy inſtructor ſpoke to them of the fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtars, each of which he told them was a ſun ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to enlighten other ſyſtems of worlds, they were loſt in the ſtupendous contemplation, and could on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ſilence adore the great Being who formed and animated the whole.

            <p>"Perhaps they were," ſaid the Colonel.</p>
            <p>"I was quite delighted,' ſaid Eleanor, "to ſee them carry food to their poor blind Father, who could no longer ſeek it for himſelf."</p>

               <pb n="56" facs="unknown:035098_0054_1000B5E9167F8198"/>
"You ſee, Eleanor," ſaid the Colonel, "that the pure ſentiment of filial tenderneſs is given alike to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals and to men."</p>
            <p>"Animals have then a ſoul?" ſaid Eleanor.</p>
            <p>"Why do you preſume that they have?" returned the Colonel.</p>
            <p>"They have, at leaſt, <hi>reflectio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>"Upon what do you found your concluſion?" ſaid the Colonel.</p>
            <p>"Why," ſaid Eleanor, "is it not evident that the lizards muſt have reflection? They, without doubt, ſay to themſelves, our father is blind and old, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſeek food for himſelf; it is, therefore, our part to carry it to him, that he may live the longer."</p>
            <p>"I am pleaſed with your argument, Eleanor," ſaid the Colonel, as it ſprings from the goodneſs and ſimplicity of your heart; but I will teach you to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count more rationally for what you have ſeen; many celebrated naturaliſts have given examples equally ſtriking of the ſeeming rationality of animals. The intellectual faculties may be divided into two kinds, <hi>ſoul</hi> and <hi>inſtinct.</hi> The ſoul is that portion of us,
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:035098_0055_1000B5EA9DE2E4E8"/>
which reflects, foreſees, examines and compares. Inſtinct is that natural ſentiment which leads us to preſerve our being, to tremble at the ſight of a wound, and to compaſſionate an unfortunate being. Some philoſophers have given to this laſt faculty the name of SYMPATHY. Whatever it be, it is that alone which animates animals, and diſſolves with their machines. INSTINCT ſerves them inſtead of reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The lizards do not, as you imagine, ſay, "Let us comfort ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> father." They do not know him under that character: they are ignorant that they owe their life to him, but they love and comfort him becauſe nature prompts them to it. Do you think, my child, that ferocious animals reflect when they fall upon you? No; neither, by the ſame rule, would thoſe that are gentle, ſhould you treat them ill, reſolve to retaliate. They have paſſions, but they owe them only to the organization of their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine, and to the nature of their inſtinct. Had they REFLECTION, they would feel grief, inquietude, and melancholy, ſenſations which they experience only when ſick or wounded. Su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>"What is the matter, Ambroſe?" ſaid he: "Speak, Eleanor; what has happened?"</p>
            <p>"They are come!" faultered the children; "they are in the iſland!"</p>
            <p>"Whom do you mean?" ſaid the Colonel.</p>

               </gap>t behind, and lying flat on his ſtomach, on the ſummit of a mount that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked the iſle, beheld the ſavages, to the number of about forty or fifty, quit their canoes, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance into the iſland. Their ſkins were painted of ſuch a deep red, that being almoſt naked, in the ſun they more nearly reſembled boiled lobſters than men; and to add to their groteſque appearance, round their bodies, on all ſides, hung plates of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, the form of which the Colonel, however, could not perfectly determine. The women, diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by their children, which they carried on their backs, wore a pagne or camiſa round their waiſt, cloſer than that of the men, and about two or three inches deep. Having taken from their canoes ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocks, arms, and different utenſils, they penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted further into the iſle, entered the foreſt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to hunt. This exerciſe continued the whole day and part of the night, during which the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel and his pupils, not daring to deſcend from the mount, were witneſſes of all that paſſed. They ſaw them toward morning iſſue from the wood, carrying with them the beaſts they had ſlain, goats, otters, antas, and a great number of parrots and other birds.
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:035098_0063_1000A374AF93CB58"/>
Immediately the quadrupeds were ſkinned, the fleſh out up, and the bones ſeparated. A fire was then kindled, in the manner of the negroes, by rubbing two pieces of wood violently together, and they ſet about dreſſing their meats. A large veſſel, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a quantity of crabs, was then brought, and ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler ones of palm wine, brandy, camphire, &amp;c. after which they began their repaſt. It was a ſight truly comic, to ſee all theſe coloured ſavages ſquatted, like ſo many monkies, in a circle, devouring with an exceſſive appetite, and picking with as much agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity as eagerneſs, even the ſmalleſt claws of the crabs, which are conſidered among them as a great dainty. Having drank repeated draughts of palm wine and brandy, they began to ſhout, ſing, and burſt into fits of exceſſive laughter, opening an enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous mouth, and diſcovering the whiteſt and moſt beautiful teeth in the world: but ſoon growing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicated, they roſe, leaped, gambolled, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a thouſand extravagancies; till this noiſy feaſt being ended, they on a ſudden overturned their uten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſils, carried them away, and ran half mad to their canoes, which, ſwift as an arrow, conveyed them from the iſland. When they were at ſome diſtance, the Colonel and his two pupils deſcended from the
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:035098_0064_1000B5F78FAC3CD0"/>
mountain, and replaced in their cabin the movea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles they had for ſafety depoſited in the ſubterranean cave, exhauſted with fatigue and hunger, they did not that night go to reconnoitre the place where the ſavages had been feaſting, but the next morning early they ſet out, and arrived at the field of action. They found there baſkets, knives, and wooden cups, which the ſavages, in their haſte and intoxication, had left behind them, beſides plenty of good cheer. They took from among the utenſils ſuch as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them the moſt uſeful and curious, and having reſted and refreſhed themſelves, again ſet out for their cabin. Their way was through a wood, which they had hitherto but little frequented, and they ſlop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to admire a grot upon which Nature ſeemed to have laviſhed all her beauties. Concealed by cotton ſhrubs, and bananas, the ſhade of which gave a religious aſpect to the place, they gained the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance by a path hollowed out of the rock, and bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by a thouſand aromatic plants. The entrance, arched and ruinated, was enlightened only by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection which the light threw on a rivulet that iſſued from the grot: the banks of this ſtream being more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elevated, formed a natural foot way through the grot, at the bottom of which our travellers obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a faint light, which appeared to ſhine through the chinks of the rock. This induced them to enter,
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:035098_0065_1000A377D5C787F0"/>
but ſcarcely had they advanced many paces, when deep groans ſeemed to proceed from the further part of the grot. The Colonel ſtopped:—and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren alarmed, in vain endeavoured to articulate founds which fear froze upon their lips. They ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced a few paces farther; the groans became more diſtinct, and in a few minutes they heard theſe words repeated in a melancholy voice:—"Oh, Death, when wilt thou come to my ſuccour."—"Heavens!" cried the Colonel, "what prodigy is this? The accents are Engliſh!"</p>
            <p>"Whoſoever thou art?" returned the voice, "in pity—"</p>
            <p>"Where are you?" interrupted the Colonel, ſtill advancing; "who are you?"</p>
            <p>"An unfortunate dying man," returned the voice.</p>
            <p>The Colonel ſtill proceeded: the voice ſeemed familiar to his ear, but he could ſee nothing. At length, his eyes becoming more accuſtomed to the gloom, he diſcerned on the ground a body almoſt naked, which, on a cloſer view, he found to be wounded. Shocked at a ſight of ſo much horror,
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:035098_0066_1000B5F917B3CB78"/>
he knelt down, and taking the hand of the ſtranger, "Unhappy man," ſaid he, "what barbarian has treated you thus inhumanly?"—He was continuing, when the ſtranger graſping his hand to raiſe himſelf a little, on a ſudden exclaimed, "Merciful Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven! do I deceive myſelf—that voice—my honoured maſter—Colonel Carlton—"</p>
            <p>"What do I hear?" cried the Colonel. "Peter! Is it poſſible, Can it be?"</p>
            <p>"Thank Heaven!" ſaid the dying man, "I die content: my dear maſter lives!—"</p>
            <p>"Talk not of dying, my faithful Peter," ſaid the Colonel, raiſing him, and endeavouring to ſtanch the blood with his handkerchief, "Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence has not reſtored you to take you from me ſo ſoon.

The ſtranger took a little of this nouriſhment, and was much revived; but the Colonel found that he was not in a ſtate to be removed: he conveyed therefore to the grot, hammocks, mats, and ſuch things as were neceſſary to render it commodious, and attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:035098_0067_1000A37B6FDC1728"/>

The cabin was at ſome diſtance from the grot, but, atlaſt, they arrived at it, and Peter being laid in a hammock, enjoyed ſoon after a comfortable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe The Colonel, during his abode in the iſland, had had ſufficient time for the ſtudy of botany, to know thoroughly the properties of the different ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples it produced: this knowledge he applied ſo ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully, that in leſs than eight days Peter was out of danger, and at the end of a month was perfectly reſtored to health.</p>
            <p>The Reader will conclude that the Colonel, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this time, had put many queſtions to him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his misfortunes, the particulars of which he now wiſhed to hear in the order as they had occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; Peter, one day, therefore, gave his maſter the following recital.</p>
            <p>"At the inſtant, Sir," ſaid he, "that the veſſel foundered, I followed your example; ſeized a piece

of wood to aſſiſt me in ſwimming, and threw my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the ſea. I ſtruggled long againſt the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the waves, but at length my ſtrength failed me: I ſwooned, I believe, and let go the friendly oar that ſupported me, for I remember no more till I found myſelf ſtretched in a canoe, and ſurrounded by five or ſix naked men of the moſt frightful co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. My ideas were confuſed: I knew not what to think: I caſt my eyes on the vaſt plain of waters, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>lightened by the moon: then I looked round for you, my dear maſter, but not ſeeing you, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting the fatal events that had happened, my heart ſunk, and perſuaded that you were ſwallowed in the waves, an involuntary cry of horror and grief burſt from me; this terrified the ſavages who ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded me ſo much, that they would have thrown me into the ſea, had I not, ſeeing their deſign, ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened them by my prayers and tears. One of them at length addreſſed me in a jargon, compoſed of Engliſh, Dutch, and French, of which I compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, "<hi>From whence come you, White?</hi>"</p>
            <p>"A veſſel," I replied, "in which I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>"Have you any knives or ſciſſars about you, Peter?"</p>
            <p>"I have only a knife."</p>
            <p>"Give it me, White."</p>
            <p>"There it is," ſaid I, giving it to him.</p>
            <p>"Come," returned he, "I will love thee: thou ſhalt be ſlave to the Grand Cacique."</p>
            <p>"Oh, Heaven!" I exclaimed, "where do you mean to take me?"</p>
            <p>"To Friz," anſwered the negro, and you will be very happy."</p>
            <p>"I now felt the full extent of my misfortune: I was condemned, I ſaw, to ſerve the negroes, who, from their ſerocious aſpect, I doubted not were can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibals; but lamentations were vain!

The next day I began my labour, which was to turn up the ſavannas, to plant, weed, clear, and cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate them: theſe, and a thouſand other ſervices which were added, I performed without intermiſſion during four years that I remained with theſe barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, known in Europe by the name of Carribes, or Cannibals."</p>
            <p>"How?" interrupted the Colonel, "are theſe the Carribes, inhabitants of the Antilles?"</p>
            <p>"The ſame, Sir," ſaid Peter, "I was myſelf ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of their name during a year, but I learnt it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from a French ſlave who loſt his life in their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. The iſle we now inhabit, Sir, is no other than one of the Antilles, which apparently has not yet been diſcovered."</p>
            <p>"Ah, my good Peter," ſaid the Colonel, what do you tell me? Am I ſo near Cuba, St. Jago, St. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingo, Porto Rico?"</p>
            <p>"You undoubtedly are, Sir," ſaid Peter, "but you muſt obſerve that the iſlands of which you ſpeak form the Great Antilles, whereas this we now inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit is in the Little Antilles. There are alſo other countries of the Carribes; but that I have left is ſo ſavage and barbarious, and ſo little commercial, that
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:035098_0072_1000B5FD8FBDB960"/>
it is to be preſumed it has little connexion with the Europeans eſtabliſhed in the Great Antilles."</p>
            <p>"Your obſervation is juſt, Peter," ſaid the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel; but gracious Heaven! a poſſibility remains—Hope once more revives—I ſhall again ſee En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland! Yes, my children, I ſhall conduct you to the abodes of men—to the boſom of my country."—Such was the flattering proſpect with which the vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of cities inhabited by civilized men furniſhed Colonel Carlton; he did not reflect that he was, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, ſeperated from them, and that during four years which he had reſided in the iſland, he had never ſeen a human being except the Carribes land upon it. The tranſports to which theſe hopes gave birth being, at length, ſomewhat calmed, Peter, at the requeſt of his maſter continued his narrative.</p>
            <p>"The Carribes with whom I lived, Sir, have ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little commerce with the Europeans; they put to ſea every year, and came into this iſland to kill buffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loes, otters, birds, &amp;c. after which they go to the coaſts inhabited by Europeans, and barter the ſkins of theſe animals, baſkets, lizards, and different ſorts of eggs, for knives, ſciſſars, hatchets, arms, European linnen, and eſpecially brandy. The day fixed upon for their laſt voyage, my maſter ordered me to bring
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:035098_0073_1000B5FF16A04C20"/>
into the canoe his hammocks, arms, and houſehold utenſils: then having, according to the cuſtom of theſe idolaters, made libations to the good ſpirits, we embarked to the number of fifty, as many women as men, and at the end of two days arrived at this iſland. As it was the firſt time during four years, my maſter had made me the companion of his voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, I drew from it the happy preſage of ſoon ſeeing an end to my captivity: for I doubted not meeting, on ſome of the coaſts at which we ſhould touch, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans whom I ſhould find means to ſoften in my favour and prevail on to aſſiſt me in my eſcape. Alas! I foreſaw not the iſſue of that unhappy day. At the end of their brutal repaſt, my maſter, intoxicated with brandy, ordered me to fill him another glaſs: I imprudently ventured to repreſent to him mildly the injury he would do himſelf; but inſtead of tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this as a mark of my good-will, he ſeized me by the throat; "Ah, dog of a white," ſaid he in a rage, "thou haſt without doubt robbed me—Die, and may thy thouſand ſouls go to the ſeas, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the ſtorms, and form the fires of Heaven!" Saying this, he g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ve me ſeveral ſtabs with a knife; but none of them were happily directed to the heart. I had ſufficient ſtrength to retreat; and notwitſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the effuſion of blood, gained a cave, in which I ſunk down exhauſted, and muſt have periſhed, had not Heaven in mercy conducted you, my dear maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to the ſpot."</p>
            <p>Eleanor and Ambroſe who had liſtened very at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively to Peter's narrative, were highly incenſed againſt the Cacique, and expreſſed their indignation in very forcible terms; but Peter endeavoured to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate it, by obſerving that the Carribes, though ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricious and cruel, were only ſo when contradicted. "They cannot," ſaid he, "bear to be dictated to; their pride upon this point is inconceivable; but they are humane, and have great compaſſion for women and children."</p>
            <p>This led the Colonel to make ſome enquiries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the laws and manners of the Carribes, and, eſpecially, whether they were as ſanguiuary and fond of feeding upon human fleſh, as they were repreſented by Europeans.</p>
            <p>"Nothing, Sir," ſaid Peter, "can be more falſe; they are certainly anthropophagi, or man-eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but it is from accident, not national taſte; if they devour their enemies, it is in the tranſport of fury, in the heat of conqueſt, and even upon the
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:035098_0075_1000B6009C73DBF8"/>
field of battle. They do not like to be called ſavages;—this name, they ſay, belongs to beaſts of prey: they equally deteſt that of a cannibal, which is with them equivalent to man-eater; but they are very fond of the title of Carribes, becauſe in their primitive language, this word ſignifies a good warrior, a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous man. The Carribes are in general tall and well proportioned; they have agreeable features ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the forehead, which is flat and much ſunk, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect which gives them a ferocious air, and ariſes from a cuſtom they have of preſſing the heads of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants with a little board, tied faſt behind, and left there till the fore head has taken the form they wiſh, and is become ſo flat, that without raiſing the head they can ſee almoſt perpendicularly above them.</p>
            <p>"This cuſtom," ſaid the Colonel, "is not peculiar to the Carribes; it is common to the ſavages in other parts of America, and it is ſaid to render the ſkull ſo hard, as frequently to have broken the ſwords of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans when they made the conqueſt of Peru."</p>
            <p>"The Carribes, Sir," ſaid Peter, 'dye their ſkins red, not only for ornament, but to preſerve them from being injured by the intenſe heat of the ſun, and alſo, to defend them from the muſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="78" facs="unknown:035098_0076_1000B6022231DC48"/>
other infects, which have an antipathy to the ſmell of the oils, and different mixtures they uſe. The women, who are ſhorter than the men, and have a more ſprightly air, decorate themſelves with brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, earings and necklaces of glaſs beads and blue ſtones; from the age of twelve they wear alſo a ſort of cotton buſkins, which reach about five or ſix inches above the ancle bone, and are wrought ſo cloſely to the leg that it is impoſſible to take them off.—The ornaments of the men are feathers and ſmall plates of a metal they call caracoli; theſe they wear at their ears, noſe, and under lip. The houſes of the Carribes are called carbets, and like thoſe of the Indians of Guiana, are of a ſingular form; the lateral parts are of reeds, and the covering of palm leaves: the roof deſcending to the rafters, gives to the whole the form of a hive. At the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of ten paces is another carb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The large carbet ſerves to lodge the chief of the family, and the ſmall one, as a kitchen, and for the accommodation of the women and children, who never enter the great carbet but when the maſter wiſhes to receive them. The furniture of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens carbet is baſkets and hammocks; of the mens,
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:035098_0077_1000B6057522C880"/>

               </gap>r which is generally a coffer, muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, ſabre, piſtol, and cartouch, effects which they exchange with the Europeans for the productions of their country. The women are very dexterous in a ſort of wicker work, of which they make their hammocks, and very curious caſkets. In theſe caſkets, which are ſo neatly wrought that no water can enter, they encloſe their jewels and attire, and when they go to ſea, faſten them to the edge of their canoes, that they may not loſe any thing ſhould they turn over, which very frequently happens. The Carribes, who took me out of the ſea, had encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, as we had, all the violence of the tempeſt, but without any alarm, tied like their caſkets to their canoes, they follow the revolutions of the waves, turn with them, and continue their rout when the danger is paſt. They have among them a ſort of religion; the ſun and moon have all their adoration, but they have neither temple nor form of worſhip. Some of their laws announce very good ſenſe; ſuch, for example, as the not electing a grand Cacique, till he has diſtinguiſhed himſelf in war, and is cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen by a plurality of voices; he muſt alſo have borne

away the prize in ſwimming, ſtrength, and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. Surely, Sir, ſuch a people ought not to be compared to ſavage beaſts."</p>
            <p>The Colonel agreed with Peter, that ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon was by no means juſt; and then added; "I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>"Do not the Carribeans," ſaid he, "carry them away, or is it an act of forgetfulneſs?"</p>
            <p>"The latter, Sir, ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Peter had nearly completed three ſcore years, but he was ſtill active and vigorous; his health being perfectly re-eſtabliſhed, he aſſiſted at the tillage, grinding of corn, and at the moſt laborious occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. He was extremely attached to the Colonel,
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:035098_0079_1000B608A0A61BC8"/>
in whoſe and his father's ſervice, he had paſſed his youth; he was therefore treated by him rather as a faithful friend, than a domeſtic, eſpecially now that one common misfortune united them. Peter ſoon became attached to Eleanor and Ambroſe: he would ſometimes take them upon his knee, and give them leſſons of morality which experience alone had taught him; and ſometimes he would play with them like a little child; ſing them Carribe ſongs, and gambol in the manner of the ſavages. In the mean while, under their indefatigable preceptor, they made a conſiderable progreſs in <hi>hiſtory, geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy,</hi> the <hi>mathematics, poetry,</hi> and even muſic. The deſcription which Peter had given them of a muſical inſtrument called the <hi>bala<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The ſubjects were either their gratitude to the Supreme Being, their affection to each other, or the beauties of their iſland, and the happineſs they enjoyed in it with their dear Carlton and honeſt Peter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="unknown:035098_0080_1000B60A31A073D8"/>
Three years had revolved ſince the arrival of Peter, and ſeven ſince his ſhipwreck, when the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel was one night alarmed by confuſed cries or rather ſhouts near his cabin. He ſtarted from his hammock, opened the door ſoftly, and went out, but the night being extremely dark, he could not ſee any thing. The ſhouts ſtill continued, but ſeemed at a much greater diſtance: he knew not what to think; but unwilling, till urged by neceſſity, to alarm Peter or the children, who were all three bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in ſleep, he aſcended a hill that bounded his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſure to the north, and looking down, perceived an enormous cloud of ſmoke through which flames of every colour ſoon found a paſſage. The foreſt that bounds his encloſure is on fire! "Oh heavens!' exclaimed he, ſeeing the ſparks carried towards his cabin, "my children—Peter'—and ſuddenly dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the hill he awakened Peter, took Eleanor in one hand, Ambroſe in the other, and flew with them to the ſea-ſhore, while Peter, informed of all by the flames and ſmoke he ſaw in the air, carried a few of the moſt valuable effects of the cabin. He would have returned for what remained, but the wind blowing from the north, carried ſo many lighted brands upon the little dwelling, that wholly
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:035098_0081_1000A391A768CE60"/>
dried by the Sun, it became in a few minutes a prey to the flames. It is impoſſible to form a juſt idea of the grief and conſternation of the Colonel and his three companions: the children ran—ſcreamed—and ſeemed ready to throw themſelves into the flames to preſerve their beloved abode, while the Colonel and Peter beheld the fatal cataſtrophe buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a ſtupid dejection. The Colonel, however, at length recovering his uſual firmneſs, bent his ſteps, followed by his little friends and Peter, toward the ſummit of a neighbouring rock, from whence, caſting his eyes round, he endeavoured to divine the cauſe of a conflagration ſo fatal and unexpected. On one ſide they beheld only a vaſt plain of fire, but looking towards the ſea, they ſaw a croud of Carribes carrying off their e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ects, and embarking precipitately in their canoes. The flames threw a reddiſh reflection upon th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſavages, and rendered them viſible at the diſtance of half a league on the ſea, their arms extended, and their eyes fixed upon the burning foreſt. Little doubt remained but that the diſaſter originated with them, and Peter, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what recovered from his terror, ſuggeſted a very probable cauſe. "It is evident, Sir," ſaid he, "that the Carribes have, as uſual, landed to hunt
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:035098_0082_1000B60D5C437558"/>
in the foreſt, and it appears to me very probable tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> this accident may have happened through the ſtratagem they make uſe of to catch the parrots, which, among other things, they barter with the Europeans.</p>
            <p>"Why," ſaid the Colonel, "do they uſe fire?"</p>
            <p>"Yes, Sir," ſaid Peter, "They obſerve in the evening the trees upon which theſe birds perch, and when it is dark, tie to ſome of the lower bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches an earthen pot in which they put lighted wood, and upon it gum and pemento; the thick ſmoke which ariſes, renders the parrots ſo giddy, that they fall down intoxicated, and become an eaſy prey to their purſuers, who immediately ſeize them, tie the feet and wings, and recover them by ſimply throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing water upon their heads."</p>
            <p>The myſtery was now unravelled; it was no longer difficult to account for an accident which had proved ſo fatal to our iſlanders; but alas! the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the cauſe did not diminiſh the calamity.</p>
            <p>At break of day they deſcended from the rock, and returned to the ſpot where once their beloved habitation had ſtood. Inſtead of it they beheld a
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:035098_0083_1000B60F0DECED18"/>
heap of ſmoking aſhes! no furniture! no books! no ſhelter! they muſt forego all.</p>
            <p>In the mean while the fire raged with violence in the foreſt; at the end of twelve days it was not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed, and would undoubtedly have conſumed the whole iſland, had the foreſt been adjacent to others; but it was abſolutely alone, forming a ſort of thicket in the midſt of an immenſe plain: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the wind blowing from the north, carried the flakes of fire upon the cabin only, and conſequently towards the ſea.</p>
            <p>During theſe twelve days, the Colonel was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving in his mind different plans, and was undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined which to purſue. He ſaw plainly that he muſt build another habitation if he remained in the iſland: but he did not ſtop here: the idea of making his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape from it had long been the favorite ſubject of his meditations; he had conceived a project which he believed to be practicable though hazardous, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing had prevented his putting it into execution, but his affection for Eleanor and Ambroſe, whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme youth had hitherto rendered them leſs able to encounter the dangers and fatigues that muſt unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably attend the enterprize; but now that he was ſtripped of all, that he found himſelf once more on
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:035098_0084_1000B610F7073050"/>
the iſland without habitation, without furniture, without any thing to render his abode in it deſirable, he began again to revolve his favourite project. "If it were poſſible," ſaid he to himſelf, "to conſtruct a canoe. My tools cannot be conſumed, I ſhall find them among the aſhes. If, I ſay, it were poſſible in this canoe to gain the iſlands inhabited by Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans! The Antilles form a half circle, ſo that if we miſſed one we ſhould unavoidably arrive at another; Cuba, St. Domingo, Jamaica, any of thoſe iſlands would facilitate our return to England. What a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful reflection! But, may we not," ſaid he, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting himſelf, "fall into the hands of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribes, by whom we are to all appearance ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? My own life I have a right to riſk, but ought I to expoſe to ſlavery, to the dangers of ſhipwreck, two unfortunate children, for whom Heaven has ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered me reſponſible? The Colonel reſted ſome time on this idea; but the hope of ſeeing England, and of reſtoring to ſociety two beings whoſe hearts and manners he had formed, in the end prevailed, and he reſolved to hazard all rather than give up an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize that flattered him with ſuch pleaſing proſpects.</p>
            <p>His plan well digeſted, he communicated it to Peter; but this wary domeſtic, far from approving,
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:035098_0085_1000B61287118A30"/>
remonſtrated with his maſter upon the danger of the enterprize. "Ah, Sir," ſaid he "reflect, conſider, I beſeech you, what will be the conſequence, ſhould we again expoſe ourſelves to the fury of an element that has already proved ſo fatal to us."</p>
            <p>"But, Peter,' ſaid the Colonel, you have ſeen the conſtruction of a canoe; you have even guided one?"</p>
            <p>"I agree, Sir," ſaid Peter, "that I have; I know very well how to work a canoe; I hope I ſhould not ſink you: nay, I could perhaps ſhun the rocks—but ſtill it is neceſſary to know where to ſteer to."</p>
            <p>"Do not be alarmed about that, Peter," ſaid the Colonel: we can ſteer towards St. Domingo, or ſhould we miſs that, we ſhall find other of the Antilles inhabited by Europeans."</p>
            <p>"But the Carribes, Sir," ſaid Peter, "think, ſhould we fall into their hands!"</p>
            <p>"True, Peter," ſaid the Colonel, "but you know the Iſle of Friz: we can avoid that."</p>
            <p>"But, Sir," ſaid Peter, "we are undoubtedly ſurrounded by the Carribes."</p>
            <p>"Heaven," interrupted the Colonel, "will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:035098_0086_1000B614CBDDEEF0"/>
us; deprived of all that has hitherto rendered our abode in this iſland tolerable, we have only a melancholy alternative." More he ſaid to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, till Peter, overcome at length by arguments and importunities, conſented to embark in an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize of which he clearly foreſaw all the dangers;—more perhaps than really exiſted, for being himſelf ignorant of geography or navigation, he beheld the ſucceſs of the voyage as much more uncertain than the Colonel.</p>
            <p>The children leaped for joy; the pleaſure of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the ſea, of ſeeing ſtrange countries, rendered them blind to the perils they were to encounter; they ſaw only the end of the voyage, without beſtowing a thought on the accidents that might interrupt it.</p>
            <p>The enterprize being reſolved upon, they began to remove the aſhes, and ſeek for their tools, which they happily found in a ſtate fit to make uſe of, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting that it was neceſſary to whet them, and to make new handles, which was the buſineſs of three days. The next object was to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom remained flat, and the ſides four feet high and fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen inches thick, inclined rather inward. The two extremities, lengthened into a point, turned up a little, that the veſſel might the more eaſily tack about. Our workmen then ſcraped the ſurface with flints, and thus compleated their canoe, which when fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed was fifteen feet long, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſt; ruſhes woven into a mat made ſails, and the leaves of the palm tree twiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed became ſtrong and ſolid cordage. As our car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters had neither iron nor nails, the whole was joined with teno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

have before told you, they tie themſelves, that when the tempeſt agitates the canoe, or cauſes it to turn over, they may follow the revolutions of their barks. The Colonel took the ſame precaution, and at the end of a month the little bark was finiſhed, and nothing remained but to launch it; a work which was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with great eaſe; for the Colonel, having taken care to fix rollers under his ſtocks, by means of a capſtan the whole was gradually moved to the ſea, where the rollers were loſt and the bark ſwam.</p>
            <p>Deſtitute of tools neceſſary for the undertaking, our reader muſt judge of the activity that was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to root up, cut, ſhape, hollow, and poliſh a tree of an immenſe ſize.

            <p>Their departure was fixed for the eighth day of the month of May. On the evening that preceeded it, the Colonel made the two children ſit down at his ſide and ſpoke to them in theſe terms.</p>
            <p>"To-morrow, my dear pupils, we ſhall leave
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:035098_0089_1000B61889087830"/>
our iſland; to-morrow we ſhall reſign ourſelves to a capricious element in purſuit of man: alas! you may, perhaps, one day regret the peaceful country in which you have till now lived ſo happy. You may one day reproach me with having cauſed you to forſake it. No matter; I do my duty, if, as I truſt, my confidence in this enterprize is a ſecret counſel of that benign Being who has hitherto watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over you. <hi>Man,</hi> my children, is not formed to live alone; he muſt carry his imperfections into ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, that he may feel them, and learn that humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity which can alone ariſe from a ſenſe of his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Excluded from the world, we are apt to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe to ourſelves a perfection which does not belong to human nature, and forget that we are called upon by the great author of our Being to combat and to conquer paſſions, of the influence of which we are alone inſenſible, becauſe ſtrangers to the objects that would excite them. Can we, for example, aſſure ourſelves that we are exempt from the ſordid paſſion of avarice, when no object is preſented to excite our cupidity? Can we aſcertain the conqueſt we have gained over ourſelves, our progreſs in patience and forbearance before we are contradicted? No, my children; it is in ſociety alone that we can form a juſt eſtimate of ourſelves; ſelf-love may indeed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude

us, but a cool and impartial examination of our actions, and the motives from whence they ſpring, will ſecure us from yielding implicitly to its dictates. In ſociety, my children, you will meet with contradictions, anxieties, and a variety of cares from which a life of ſolitude would exempt you; but be not diſcouraged; you will experience equivalent pleaſures; your hearts will dilate in the thought that you do not exiſt for yourſelves alone; they will expand in love to all around you, and in proportion as your opportunities of communicating happineſs encreaſe, your own ſources of enjoyment will multiply; but let me not, while I draw this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting picture, forget to remind you, that the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of our purpoſed voyage is uncertain: we are on the point of committing ourſelves to the caprice of the ocean, in a bark, the work of our unſkilful hands:—our rout is by no means certain. The Antilles, 'tis true, are numerous; if we miſs one, I truſt we ſhall arrive at another; but many of them are inhabited by the Carribes, and I need not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat the conſequence, ſhould we fall into their hands. I do not make theſe obſervations, my children, to diſcourage you; no, my own hopes are ſtrong; they are beſides founded upon rational and ſolid grounds; but I would recal to your young minds, too ſoon

elated with the proſpect of ſucceſs, the neceſſary reflection, that our enterprize is in the hands of God, to whoſe decrees, whether they tend to proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or fruſtrate it, 'tis our duty to ſubmit with pious and chearful reſignation."</p>
            <p>Ambroſe and Eleanor liſtened with attention to the diſcourſe of their friend, and in ſilence lifted up their hearts to the Supreme Being, and implored his protection. They then with renewed vigor ſet about conveying on board their little bark, the few articles that had been preſerved from the conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Among theſe were their tools, and a Carribe caſket, containing ſome jewels, and the letter and articles found upon Derley. Theſe laſt the Colonel had ſo much at heart, from the hope that they might one day lead to a diſcovery of Ambroſe and Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor's parents, that he ſecured them about his own perſon, in caſe of ſhipwreck or other accident. They laid in alſo a ſtore of ruſh matting and cordage made of palm leaves, and thus having completed their little cargo, retired to reſt in expectation of the next day, which was to be that of their departure. The Colonel could not cloſe his eyes all night; the ſucceſs of his approaching voyage, which at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance hope had repreſented nearly a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

now appeared doubtful; he feared, not for himſelf, but for thoſe who were to accompany him, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for the children; "they," ſaid he, "have ſcarcely entered the morning of life, and I preſume to expoſe them to the caprices of the waves! to the dangers of ſhipwre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>k! Gracious God," ſaid he, looking with fervour toward heaven, "protect them! but if they muſt periſh, ſuffer me to periſh with them; let me ſhare the puniſhment of a crime of which I alone ſhall be guilty." Theſe reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were nevertheleſs counterpoiſed by others more pleaſing: he ſtill flattered himſelf with arriving at a port of ſafety, and the thought of returning to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, once more lulled him in a pleaſing deluſion. From this he was, at length, rouſed by the return of light: the Sun gilt the tops of the mountains, and he aroſe in haſte; but the children and Peter had been before hand with him and were amuſing themſelves with carrying into the veſſel different forts of grain, ſalted fiſh, and other proviſions that were previouſly prepared, and, undoubtedly, very needful to undertake a voyage, the term of which was uncertain. One thing, however, which had till now eſcaped their recollection, cauſed ſome em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſment: this was means to carry freſh water, which was equally neceſſary as the other part of their
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:035098_0093_1000B61E809E4F58"/>
ſtores. The difficulty was, however, ſoon fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted by Peter, who preſently formed with planks, in the bottom of the veſſel, a reſervoir for the purpoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To prevent the filtrations, he ſtopped the joints with leaves dipped in a ſort of reſinous gum which had the property of being impenetrable to the water, and when filled, cloſed it very exactly, to defend it again the motion of the bark, which he feared might drive out the water.</p>
            <p>In two hours all was ready, and nothing was thought on but ſetting ſail, when on a ſudden, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe ſeeming to recollect himſelf, entreated the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel for a few minutes to delay their departure.</p>
            <p>"With all my heart, Ambroſe," ſaid the Colonel; "but tell me, do you leave your iſland with regret?"</p>
            <p>"No, father," ſaid Ambroſe, "we have nothing to regret, ſince we take you with us; but we have forgotton—Eleanor, you know what I mean—come with me—quick, quick." Saying this, he took her hand; and without further explanation, ſet off acroſs the plain, and was out of ſight in an inſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t. If the Reader is deſirous of knowing whither Eleanor and her brother were running with ſo much precipitation, he need only aſk his heart, and he will ſtrongly ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:035098_0094_1000B620080B6320"/>
it was to the tomb of their good friend Derley. "Oh yes," ſaid Eleanor, as they ran acroſs the plain, "indeed, we forgot; it was very ungrateful in us not to think of taking a laſt farewel of him." They preſently arrived at the grave, upon which, as a ſmall memorial, they had placed large ſtones ſomething in the form of a tomb. Here, with full hearts, they proſtrated themſelves, hand in hand, and began ſeveral phraſes which they could not finiſh. "Farewel, farewel, Derley," ſaid they. "Poor Derley! we ſhall never ſee you more, but we will always think of you. Poor Derley! There he lies, ſiſter."—"Yes, brother, he will be always there—Farewel, Derley, farewel, we will always remember you.—Yes, Eleanor and Ambroſe will keep you always in their hearts!"</p>
            <p>Having thus given free courſe to their gratitude, they roſe to return to the ſea-ſhore, when on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den they ſtarted back, ſtruck with a noiſe entirely new to them, they looked at each other; the noiſe was repeated: "It is only a clap of thunder, brother," ſaid Eleanor. "No," return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he, "it is not thunder." The noiſe was repeated a third time; their knees bent under them, and Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor ſunk without ſenſe or motion on the turf. While Ambroſe was ſupporting her, and endeavouring to
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:035098_0095_1000A3A49185CB48"/>
recall her ſenſes, confuſed ſounds of diſtant voices, caught his ear, "Ambroſe, Eleanor,' was repeated more than once: he knew not what to do; he would have run from the ſpot, but affection to his ſiſter with-held him. "Riſe, riſe, my dear Eleanor," ſaid he, "we are called, it is the voice of our father;" but ſome time elapſed before her ſenſes returned. At length, ſupporting her as well as he could, he ran precipitately toward the ſea-ſhore; but inſtead of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that ſide from whence the voice proceeded, by a natural impulſe he took a path that led to that part of the ſhore where they had left the Colonel and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. They arrived at the ſpot, but they were not there; their veſſel was ſtill on the waves, but no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trace of their friends remained. Ambroſe and Eleanor were too much alarmed to form any ſettled ideas; they ran here and there, repeatedly calling Father! Peter! and invoking Heaven to hear and pity their anxiety. A cluſter of rocks at length ſet ſome bound to their deſpair. "Brother," ſaid Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, "it ſtrikes me that we ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>nd them among theſe rocks." "Heaven grant that we may," ſaid Ambroſe. The path they took winding, by degrees brought them to an eminence, from whence their view comprehending a larger extent of the ocean, they diſcerned a ſmall veſſel ſailing from the iſland
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:035098_0096_1000B6218E818FE0"/>
with the greateſt rapidity. This ſight encreaſed their grief; they doubted not but that their friends were in the veſſel, and that the Carribes, or other enemies, had forced them from the iſland. Immovable with grief, their eyes ſwimming in tears, they remained upon the rock till the bark had totally diſappeared, and then burſting a-new into a flood of ſorrows, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended with heavy ſteps by a winding path, which brought them imperceptibly to a part of the ſhore at ſome diſtance from that where they had aſcended: but what a ſpect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>de of horror ſtruck their ſight! a disfigured corpſe, covered with blood, lay on the ſands! the upper jaw and ſkull had been carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; but the height and clothes correſponding, they doubted not but their generous protector lay extended before them. Eleanor ſhrieked, and again fell ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs on the ground, and Ambroſe reduced almoſt to the ſame ſtate, had ſcarcely ſtrength or courage to ſearch for proofs to deſtroy or confirm their dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſuſpicions. His heart revived, upon obſerving that the hands of the unfortunate victim were ſmall and ſoft, whereas thoſe of his friend were hard, and much ſun-burnt; the Colonel wore no ſtockings, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed did; and upon cloſe examination, he found that their clothes in many particulars differed. As for honeſt Peter, he had no fears on his account, as
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:035098_0097_1000B624D7AB3828"/>
beſides being much ſmaller, he was habited in ſkins. Convinced that it was neither the Colonel nor Peter, he flew to Eleanor, who began to revive, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated the joyful intelligence; but the idea of its being their friend, had ſo ſtrongly impreſſed her mind, that it was not till after ſhe had repeatedly queſtioned her brother, and examined the proofs, that ſhe could be perſuaded her ſuſpicions were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded. For further ſatisfaction, Ambroſe ſearched the pockets of the deceaſed, and found in them a pocket-book, knife, pipe and other articles, which they well knew their friend did not poſſeſs. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved every doubt: tears of joy mingled with thoſe of woe were ſhed on both ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es; it was not their friend—the dreadful certainty of his being no more was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved; and hope, if it did not ſpeak peace to their hearts, at leaſt ſuſpended the violence of their grief. They began to diſcourſe with more c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lmneſs on what had happened, and attem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

At the ſide of the deceaſed they found a weapon, which, by the deſcription they had heard, they judged to be a piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol. This they concluded had deprived him of life, but all beyond was a myſtery they could not pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>jecture they were turning from the melancholy ſpot, when Ambroſe obſerved
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:035098_0098_1000A3DA5F91A270"/>
to his ſiſter, that it was neceſſary, in ſome way or other, to diſpoſe of the unfortunate man before them. "Whether he were a friend or an enemy, Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor," ſaid he, "we owe him the duties of humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: this was a leſſon taught us by our dear father, and ſhall we neglect to practice it?" He then went in purſuit of a wooden ſpade, and preſently return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, dug a hole in the ſand, in which, aſſiſted by Eleanor, he with infinite toil and difficulty depoſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the corpſe. They then, hand in hand, took their way along the ſhore: the ſight of their little bark, at length, recalled the remembrance of their friend, and renewed the violence of their grief; they ſtopped to give vent to their tears, and then ſitting down on the point of a ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, they for ſome minutes were loſt in melancholy reflections: at length Eleanor broke ſilence: "I am perſuaded," ſaid ſhe, "that the Carribes have forced them from the iſland." "There is more reaſon," returned Ambroſe, "to think that it was other enemies; the man whom we have juſt buried is not a Carribe; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> is dreſſed like our father."</p>
            <p>"True," ſaid Eleanor, "but a thought has ſtruck me; perhaps, like Peter, he has been made priſoner by the Carribes; it is very poſſible that he
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:035098_0099_1000A3C08DCC49A0"/>
may have loſt his life in the defence of our dear father."</p>
            <p>Ambroſe pauſed a moment upon this idea. "What you ſuggeſt, ſiſter," ſaid he, "is certainly poſſible; the unfortunate man we have ſeen may have loſt his life in defence of our father, but the veſſel we ſaw was certainly very different from the canoes of the Carribes."</p>
            <p>"It certainly," ſaid Eleanor, "appeared very different; but the diſtance was great, our eyes might deceive us; for my part, I ſcarcely knew what I felt or what I ſaw."</p>
            <p>"That is true," ſaid Ambroſe; "but yet I am ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, from the deſcription I have heard from my father, that what we ſaw was a European veſſel."</p>
            <p>"But the Carribes," ſaid Eleanor, "are ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to land upon this iſland—"</p>
            <p>"Well," interrupted Ambroſe, "Carribes or Europeans, would to Heaven they had taken us with them! For my part, I would rather have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured ſlavery, nay, death itſelf, than what I now feel."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="102" facs="unknown:035098_0100_1000A46A1509B248"/>
"And ſo would I," faid Eleanor. "Oh, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe, our dear father! can we ever forget him! Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter too—'</p>
            <p>A burſt of ſorrow concluded. The day was ſpent in lamentations and vain conjectures, and at night they returned with ſlow and heavy ſleps to the cave, which, ſince the conflagration had ſerved them as an abode. Here every object reminded them of their loſs, and renewed the violence of their grief; here their dear protector had diſcourſed with them; here they had partaken with him the laſt meal; they wept, they recollected a thouſand inſtances of his kindneſs, which did but aggravate their ſorrow. At length, nature exhauſted, called for repoſe; Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor ſunk into an uneaſy ſlumber; Ambroſe did the ſame, but preſently ſtarted from it, and began again to ponder upon the dreadful events of the preceeding day; his thoughts hurried from one thing to another, till an idea occurred which fixed effectually his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and revived his hopes. He impatiently waited for the return of day, that he might communicate it to his ſiſter, who no ſooner awaked than he addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her in theſe words: "What can it avail us, ſiſter, to remain in an iſland where every object re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minds <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

is, you know, ready, it is rigged, ſtored, every thing is complete. What hinders us from putting to ſea? If we remain here, we muſt for ever give up the hope of ſeeing our dear father again; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, if we venture to ſea, it is poſſible we may ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at ſome iſland, where we may hear tidings of him."</p>
            <p>"But," ſaid Eleanor, ſtarting at ſo daring an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, "we do not know how to guide a canoe—and then the Carribes—"</p>
            <p>"As to the guiding of a canoe," ſaid Ambroſe, "I have heard Peter deſcribe it ſo often, that I have no fears upon that head; and as to the Carribes, we muſt avoid them; we, as well as my father, know the iſlands that are inhabited by the Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and can eaſily ſteer toward them."</p>
            <p>"Yes," ſaid Eleanor, "we know them very well upon the map, but when one is upon the great ocean'—</p>
            <p>"Well ſiſter," ſaid ambroſe, "I do not deſire to force you, but for my part, as I have told you before, I would rather endure ſlavery, or even death, than this dreadful uncertainty upon our dear Carlton's fate."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="104" facs="unknown:035098_0102_1000A3B502C62CB0"/>
"I would riſk every thing," ſaid Eleanor, "were there a hope of diſcovering him; but our ſucceſs is very uncertain; we may never reach the iſlands in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited by Europeans, and if we do, may not—"</p>
            <p>"Well," interrupted Ambroſe, provoked at the obſtacles his ſiſter raiſed to a project upon which his imagination, already began to be much heated, "I ſee that you are averſe to what I propoſe."</p>
            <p>"You cannot ſurely think, brother," ſaid Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, "that I am averſe to any thing that can afford a reaſonable hope of ſeeing again our dear father. But we in our certain danger in this enterprize, and after all, our ſucceſs is very uncertain; if we eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape the Carribes, and the dangers of the ſea, we may not gain the information we wiſh.."—</p>
            <p>"I agree, my dear ſiſter," ſaid Ambroſe, "that it is poſſible our enquiries may not prove ſucceſsful: but on the other hand, there is rational grounds to ſuppoſe that they may. The veſſel which conveyed our friends from the iſland, was undoubtedly Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean; it is therefore highly probable, that among Europeans we may find them. Cuba, St. Domin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, Porto Rico, and the other iſlands inhabited by Europeans, lie near to, and without doubt, have
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:035098_0103_1000B626B02F57A8"/>
a communication with each other; if we reach one, we ſhall eaſily extend our enquiries to others, and it will be hard indeed if we do not ſomewhere gain the intelligence we ſeek. Courage and perſeverence, ſiſter, are neceſſary to every enterprize; without theſe, our dear father has often told us, nothing can be effected, and with them, that few things are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible."—</p>
            <p>"And do you really think, brother," ſaid Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, half perſuaded to liſten to a project, which though it at firſt alarmed her, held out the ſoothing hope of recovering their loſt friends, "Do you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally think we may reach the iſlands you ſpeak of?"</p>
            <p>"I am perſuaded that we may," ſaid Ambroſe, "I do not pretend to ſuppoſe that we are not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter dangers and difficulties; but, my dear ſiſter, had circumſtances been reverſed, had my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's fate been ours, and he left to lament our loſs, do you think dangers or difficulties would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded his purſuit? No, be aſſured his affection would have ſurmounted every obſtacle; and ſhall we, who owe all to his goodneſs, fear to encounter the perils of the ſea, or, perhaps, ſlavery, (for this is the worſt that can happen) when the delightful

hope, however diſtant, is afforded of ſeeing him and ſharing, if we cannot alleviate, his misfortune? Recollect, my dear ſiſter, with what tenderneſs he has watched over our infancy, how ſtudious he has been to cultivate our minds, and train our hearts to virtue! Reflect upon the many—"</p>
            <p>"Say no more, brother," interrupted Eleanor, upon whoſe feelings this laſt argument operated more powerfully than all the reſt, "I am aſhamed of my fears, and will from this moment be wholly guided by your advice. God will, I truſt, grant us his protection, and guide us to our dear father, our beſt, our only friend."</p>
            <p>Such was the diſcourſe of Eleanor and Ambroſe before they left the cave. They then fell upon their knees, implored the protection of the Supreme Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and walked toward the ſea ſhore, diſcourſing upon their project. The Sun was by this time ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> ſhot away like an arrow. Eleanor, ſeeing the ſhore fly from her, ſhrieked, and would
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:035098_0105_1000B62888E96710"/>
have returned to the iſland; but Ambroſe, affecting the greateſt fortitude, employed all his eloquence to encourage his ſiſter, and at laſt ſucceeded. A wind preſently ariſing from land, drove them into the open ſea, and their beloved iſle ſoon vaniſhed from their view. The ſun, in the mean while, had run more than half his courſe, and the weather, which had till now been favourable, on a ſudden changed: thick clouds obſcured the air, the ſea ran high, and ſome drops of rain threatened an approaching ſtorm; all nature ſeemed to prepare for a great revolution. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe, though alarmed, endeavoured, by every ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument he could ſuggeſt, to encourage and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade his ſiſter there was no danger, but the horror, which, in ſpite of his efforts to appear ſerene, was impreſſed on his countenance, and the gulf, which from time to time opened and threatened to ſwallow them, ſpoke too forcibly not to be underſtood. Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, nevertheleſs, encouraged by the example of her brother, ſummoned all the reſolution ſhe was miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs of, and reſolved, if it were the will of God that they ſhould periſh, to meet death with fortitude. The weather, however, which continued foul till the middle of the night, at length cleared, and gave place to the Moon, which, reflecting her ſilver diſk

               </gap>ted the courage of our poor voyagers, more embarraſſed on the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid elements, than were, heretofore, the firſt navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gators. But on a ſudden a new object excited their terrors. On the top of their maſt ſhone a light, which to their troubled imagination, ſeemed fire de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending from heaven to conſume their veſſel. This, tho' an appearance familiar to mariners, &amp; the natural conſequence of a heated and damp atmoſphere, ſtruck them with inconceivable horror. They claſped each other cloſely, and fixing their eyes upon the electric flame, had neither power to weep nor to ſpeak. Nor was this all; the ſea ran high. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times their little bark roſe upon the billows, and then again ſeemed to ſink, never to riſe, into the depth of the vaſt ocean. Death every inſtant preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed itſelf to their view, and they could only wonder that they had not already met it in the waves.</p>
            <p>Thirty hours they remained in this anxiety, ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly daring to ſtir, and only from neceſſity taking a little of the nouriſhment their veſſel afforded, At length, near the cloſe of the day, the wind chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing carried them towards a coaſt, which, on the firſt view, appeared to be deſert; but on approaching it they diſtinguiſhed men running on the ſands, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine

their bark. Their hearts rebounded at the ſight of land; they perceived by the dreſs and colour of the iſlanders, that they were not Carribes, and far from being alarmed, were inſpired with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt confidence. They rejoiced at the proſpect of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once more ſafe upon land, and hoped ſoon to hear news of the colonel and Peter, as if, (ſuch was was their ſimplicity) all the world was obliged to know them.</p>
            <p>When they were near land, a little boat took them on board, and carried them on ſhore; but the aſtoniſhment of the iſlanders upon finding two child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren habited in ſkins, alone, in a bark ingeniouſly conſtructed and furniſhed with different ſorts of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, is not eaſy to be deſcribed; a thouſand queſtions were in an inſtant put to them, to which they anſwered in Engliſh, have you ſeen Colonel Carlton or Peter? Where are they? In pity tell us, we are ſeeking them, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The iſlanders, who were Spaniards, underſtood nothing of all this; but one among them, who knew Engliſh, acted as interpreter, and anſwered by aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them that they knew nothing of the perſons of whom they ſpoke.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="110" facs="unknown:035098_0108_1000A3C7654824C8"/>
The noiſe of their arrival, and the ſingular cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances that attended it, ſoon reached the ears of the Governor, to whoſe palace they were conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amidſt a croud of people, whom curioſity had drawn together.</p>
            <p>The Governor viewed them with ſurprize, put ſeveral queſtions to them, and ſeemed to be much pleaſed with their youth and ſimplicity. Ambroſe and Eleanor, giddy with all they ſaw and heard, anſwered only in monoſyllables, or by ſomething in which the Colonel or Peter always made a part. The Governor, who ſpoke Engliſh, in vain aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured them he did not know their friends: ſolely oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied with the idea, they would abſolutely inſiſt upon his knowing them, and giving them the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation they wiſhed. At length, after repeated queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the Governor made them ſit down, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed them to this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>Ambroſe replied, "We are almoſt fifteen."</p>

could not forget that they had loſt him; beſides, their attention was wholly engroſſed by the objects that ſurrounded them: the wax lights, the plates, the meats, the furniture, and then the clothes of the iſlanders! all ſtruck them with wonder and delight. They could only gaze and admire, they had not leiſure to eat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſcarely to attend to the queſtions of the Governor. Supper being at length ended, and a few hours having in ſome meaſure fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarized the ſurrounding wonders, the Governor requeſted Ambroſe to acquaint him more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly with his adventures. He complied, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted himſelf with the beſt grace imaginable; omitted no circumſtance that was in the leaſt inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting; ſpoke in the higheſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>erms of their obligations to Colonel Carlton; extolled the fidelity of Peter, and concluded with deſcribing the manner in which they were deprived of their friends, their grief, and the happineſs they ſhould experience could they be reſtored to them.</p>
            <p>The Governor thanked Ambroſe for his narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; and obſerving that reſt was neceſſary after the fatigues they had undergone, ordered each to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to a ſeparate apartment. The thought of a ſeparation, ſituated as they were among ſtrangers,

and in a ſtrange land, excited a painful ſenſation, but propriety rendered it neceſſary, and they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. In the morning however, at day break, Ambroſe haſtened to his ſiſter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>"Why do you think ſo?" ſaid Ambroſe.</p>
            <p>"I don't know," returned Eleanor, "but there is ſomething in this Governor that terrifies me very much. He is not like our dear Carlton."</p>
            <p>"True, Eleanor," ſaid her brother; "but what do you apprehend?"</p>
            <p>"I don't know," ſaid Eleanor; "but whenever he ſpeaks, or looks at me, I cannot help trembling."</p>
            <p>"Nay, my dear ſiſter," ſaid Ambroſe, "that is abſurd; there is at preſent no cauſe for alarm; the

No ſhops were to be ſeen in the iſland; the inhabitants, to the number of about four hundred, as many men as women, lived upon the produce of a little field, which each cultivated behind his houſe. At the ſide of Don Leſcar's palace was a chapel, in which was an old Dominican, who was held in great venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the whole iſland, preſided. With reſpect to the morals and cuſtoms of this Baytian colony, the reader will ſoon learn them from the mouth of an

            <p>The iſland was ſituated about the 25th degree 15 minutes north latitude, and 57 degrees 11 minutes weſt longitude. It might be in length about ſix lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, and in breadth three: nothing was wanting to neatneſs, convenience, or utility: the houſes were built along the ſea-coaſt to the eaſt, where a port was formed, well fortified with a tower and ramparts. Here Eleanor and Ambroſe ſtopped, while the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, their guide, withdrew to converſe at ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with a friend whom he had met. They ſat down, and fixing their eyes upon their little bark, which remained chained in the baſin, began to call to their remembrance the happy hours they had ſpent with their protector, when a little old man with a long white beard, came and ſeated himſelf beſide them: he looked ſteadfaſtly on them for ſome mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, and then broke ſilence:—"Amiable, inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting children," ſaid he, "ſuffer an old man, whoſe head is white with age, to behold and converſe with you: from the firſt moment! ſaw on the port, your youth, your innocence, your misfortunes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted me: As I view you, my heart expands: ſpeak, amiable children, who gave you birth?"</p>

"We are ignorant," replied Ambroſe; "in our infancy we were deſerted in an uninhabited iſland: God ſent us a father a protector; he brought us up and inſtructed us; but we have juſt loſt him, and ſet out determined to ſeek him all over the world, when chance brought us to your country."</p>
            <p>"How I pity you, my good children!" ſaid the old man, "how! lament that you muſt reſide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men ſo wicked as thoſe which inhabit this iſland!"</p>
            <p>"What do you tell us!" exclaimed Eleanor and Ambroſe, alarmed.</p>
            <p>"I tell you, my children," replied the old man, "a melancholy truth; nothing but unbridled licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs reigns here; vice and folly divide the wretched inhabitants of St. Verrado."</p>

            <p>Ambroſe and Eleanor thanked the old man for the friendly intereſt he took in what concerned them, and aſſured him of their readineſs to attend to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels; at the ſame time they could not forbear expreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſurprize that he ſhould continue to reſide among ſuch wicked people. "Alas! my children," ſaid the ſtranger, neceſſity not inclination detains me: would to Heaven I could abandon this deteſted place! but fate has rendered it my priſon."—Here the old man ſeemed for ſome moments overwhelmed with grief; then recollecting himſelf, and obſerving, by the intelligent countenances of his young auditors, the impreſſion his diſcourſe made upon them, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed: "I ſee, my young friends, that my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe ſurprizes you: you know not what to think of it; but the hiſtory of our Governor, with which a reſidence of ſome years in this iſland has fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted me, will throw a full light on my ſubject.

While the carpenter purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his work, Don Leſcar, with his friend Blake, and a few others advanced into the iſle, which he found to be fruitful, but entirely unfrequented, and wild; immediately the ſingular idea of founding a

In this dilemma, Don Leſcar, ever fruitful in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients, recollected the ſtratagem made uſe of by the Romans to carry of the Sabine women—but I forget, my children, that you are unacquainted with the hiſtory of civilized nations—"</p>
            <p>Eleanor and Ambroſe here interrupted him to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that though they had been brought up on a deſert iſland, their kind friend had taught them that they were not the only beings exiſting in the world, and had acquainted them with the hiſtory of other countries.</p>
            <p>The old man then continued: "Don Leſcar pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to his comrades to make uſe of the ſame ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem, and they accordingly ſet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The wind was favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and the veſſel departed, while the people on ſhare gazed on us with the utmoſt unconcern, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Don Leſcar's deſign was merely to afford us the pleaſure of a little excurſion on the ſea; we too at firſt believed his intention to be no other, but fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally were we undeceived? The veſſel, which was a ſwift ſailer, in ſpite of our prayers and tears, conveyed us to this iſland, never to return. The men, myſelf only and a few others, from whom they judged they had nothing to fear, excepted, were all maſſacred; the women alone, who were the objects of their treachery, were preſerved, and thoſe aſſembled at the fete, being for the moſt part diſſipated and abandoned, eaſily accommodated themſelves to the terms offered by Don Leſcar. A few, however, preferred death to becoming the wives of their baſe enſlavers; and theſe drag out a miſerable exiſtence in the priſons of St. Verrado.</p>
            <p>When the inhabitants were furniſhed with the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries, they began to think of the luxuries of life, and George Blake, at the head of an hundred men, put to ſea to pillage merchant-men and other veſſels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Ambroſe and Eleanor trembled at theſe dreadful words, which the ſtranger obſerving, haſtened to divert their attention.</p>
            <p>"Don Leſcar," ſaid he, "notwithſtanding theſe precautions, is ſenſible that other chains than thoſe of force are neceſſary to bind his ſubjects; he labours to render their ſtate agreeable, that he may add thoſe of inclination; with this view he permits an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained licence, which he judges alone capable of attaching them. To conſeſs the truth, all are ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with their condition, and among them there is not a ſingle inhabitant, myſelf excepted, deſirous of quitting St. Verrado to inhabit another country. Every day there are ſuperb entertainments at the palace of the Governor, balls, concerts, and aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, they love riot and diſſipation; what would they more? they have it to their wiſh. Such, my children, are the laws of the Verradians; ſuch their manner of life; endeavour to bear with, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate yourſelves to it, without wandering from the principles of virtue: live here, ſince hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven has ſent you, wiſe, gentle, modeſt, temperate, and do not imitate the odious companions with whom you muſt aſſociate. I will from time to

time ſee, and adviſe you: perſuaded that you will be ſecret, and ſet ſome value on my leſſons.</p>
            <p>Eleanor and Ambroſe aſtoniſhed and ſhocked at all they heard, thanked the old man for his informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and expreſſed their readineſs to be guided by his advice. Then ſeeing their guide, he bade them farewell, telling them at parting, that he was called the Count d'Oreſty.</p>
            <p>Don Leſcar upon their return, inquired how they liked his city? But obſerving the impreſſion of melancholy, which notwithſtanding their efforts to appear chearful, the diſcourſe of the Count d'Oreſty had left upon their countenances, he expreſſed his diſpleaſure. Eleanor and Ambroſe excuſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, attributing it to the concern they could not help feeling for the loſs of their protector. This was the firſt time they had ever known diſſimulation, or felt the neceſſity of it. "And wherefore," ſaid the Governor, "this unavailing ſorrow? This Carlton was your friend and protector: well, I will be ſo; I will love and protect you as well as he did; I will do more; I will cauſe all my ſubjects to honor and reſpect you. Beſides, a thought has ſtruck me concerning your friend; the manner in
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:035098_0124_1000B63A811A8C08"/>
which he and Peter diſappeared, is ſingular; I have reflected upon it, and do not think it in the leaſt improbable but that you may, in a very ſhort time, ſee him land in this iſland."</p>
            <p>Eleanor and Ambroſe exclaimed in an extacy, How? Where? My Lord—do you know?—Is there any hope of—</p>
            <p>"Have patience," interrupted Don Leſcar, "and be not ſo elate; what I ſuggeſt, is merely conjecture; I will tell you upon what grounds: My ſubjects frequently make ſhort trips upon the ſeas, for the purpoſe of taking prizes; it is not eight days ſince one of my captains ſailed with about a hundred and fifty men: now as the time agrees with that in which, by your account, your friends diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared, it ſeems very probable that he may have touched at the iſland, and borne them away to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the inhabitants of my colony. Can you deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe the corpſe you found lying on the ground?"</p>
            <p>"No," replied Ambroſe, "it was too much disfigured; but we found about it ſome papers and other articles which I will ſhew you. Saying this, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>an his countenance changed; "Heavens! exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he, what do I ſee! 'tis the hand writing of my friend! 'tis he himſelf; the hand of an aſſaſſin has divided us for ever." With theſe words he darted a furious glance upon Ambroſe, graſped the papers, and went out of the apartment, without pronounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſingle word. The children looked at each other amazed: "What have we done?" ſaid Eleanor.</p>
            <p>"He thinks," ſaid Ambroſe, "that the man who was killed upon our coaſt is his friend."</p>
            <p>"Let us fly," ſaid Eleanor, alarmed, "perhaps he will revenge his death upon us."</p>
            <p>"And why fly?" ſaid Ambroſe, "were that even poſſible, when we may expect ſoon to ſee our dear father; he will counſel and defend us.</p>
            <p>"Ah, no," ſaid Eleanor, "he is without doubt murdered: we can no longer entertain the hope of ſeeing him."</p>
            <p>A deep ſilence enſued, and they remained over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with the bittereſt reflections. Two days elapſed before they ſaw the Governor; on the third he ſent for them into his apartment; his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance was gloomy and moroſe; hut he received them
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:035098_0126_1000B63D7572DC80"/>
with his former kindneſs. "I have ſuffered much, my young friends," ſaid he, "ſince I ſaw you; I have ſhed many tears and it is this Carlton whom you regret ſo much, who has cauſed them to flow; baniſh him, therefore, from your remembrance, as the enemy of one whom you muſt henceforth learn to honour and obey."</p>
            <p>"Ah, my Lord," ſaid Eleanor, falling upon her knees, "pardon our dear protector—the injury he has done you was involuntary: in his own defence—Pardon him; Eleanor on her knees entreats it. As a favour—"</p>
            <p>"As a favour, ſiſter," interrupted Ambroſe bluntly; "as juſtice you mean; had Don Leſcar been in the place of our Carlton, would he not have done the ſame?</p>
            <p>"Young man," ſaid Don Leſcar, incenſed at the oblique reproof that was conveyed to him in theſe words, "moderate your impetuoſity; remember that you are in the preſence of your King.</p>
            <p>"I reſpect your title," ſaid Ambroſe, "though I know not what is due to it; but I appeal to your heart, to your probity: you believe that our Carlton has deſtroyed your friend, admitting it to be ſo, you

know not the provocation:—WE are aſſured it was in defence of his life or liberty, and, in this caſe, is he not juſtified? The man of honour ſhould approve the actions that honour juſtifies."</p>
            <p>"And do you," ſaid Don Leſcar, "bred in the depths of foreſts, pretend to talk of honour? Do you pretend to know its laws?"</p>
            <p>"I know the rights of man toward man," ſaid Ambroſe, "they are equal to all beings, common to all States."</p>
            <p>"And ſo," ſaid Don Leſcar, with a ſarcaſtic ſmile, "knowing natural laws, you pretend to judge of thoſe preſcribed by civil ſociety and religion? Are theſe the fine maxims your friend has taught you?"</p>
            <p>"He has taught me at leaſt," ſaid Ambroſe, "to deſpiſe irony, and to brave pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>."</p>
            <p>Don Leſcar was incenſed: "Ungrateful wretch," ſaid he, "is this the return for all my favours? Tremble at the effects of my diſpleaſure."</p>
            <p>It muſt be owned that the ſentiments of Ambroſe were uttered with an aſperity and confidence that cannot be juſtified: Don Leſcar was his ſuperior in

               </gap>, &amp; though the Count d'Oreſty had deſtroyed the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence they might otherwiſe have repoſed in him, no perſonal injury had yet been offered; ſome reſpect was, therefore, due to him; but bred in unfrequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wilds, accuſtomed to combat the beaſts of the foreſt, and hardened by labour and fatigue, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe had contracted a certain roughneſs of character, which rendered him a little ſavage: he had never been contradicted; on this occaſion he was; his heart, replete with the nobleſt ſentiments, could not brook the pride of a man, whom he not only conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as the enemy of his deareſt friend, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded by his vices beneath the loweſt of his ſpecies. Eleanor poſſeſſed equal ſtrength of mind with her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but ſhe was more timid; every thing alarmed her, becauſe ſhe more quickly foreſaw the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences.

            <p>"It is for your ſake alone, Eleanor," ſaid Don Leſcar, "that I can forget the inſults and arrogance of a youth, who is unworthy a ſiſter ſo beautiful and intereſting: my heart is already weighed down

            <p>"Oh!" ſaid Eleanor, "what will become of us!"</p>
            <p>"Fear nothing, ſiſter," ſaid Ambroſe, "God will protect us; I trembled on the waves, I wept at our ſeparation from our dear father and Peter, but I will never weep or tremble at the threats of a tyrant: we will endeavour to ſee our good old man; he will conſole and adviſe us." Saying this, they took their way towards the port, in the hope of meeting the Count d'Oreſty, but they were that night diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: in ſhort, ſeveral days elapſed before they ſaw
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:035098_0130_1000B64088AA6628"/>
him, except in the preſence of witneſſes, before whom it was impoſſible to diſcourſe of any thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting. During this time, Ambroſe and Eleanor had the mortification of hearing the moſt horrid exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations beſtowed upon the name of Carlton; he was now univerſally believed to be the aſſaſſin of the naval Chief, and the arrival of the Verradian veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel was awaited with impatience, to ſacrifice both him and his accomplice, Peter, to the vengeance of the people. Eleanor and her brother, therefore, far from looking with joy, as formerly, to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his arrival, prayed fervently to Heaven that it might be retarded. In the mean while a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay ſo unuſual began to alarm the inhabitants, from the ſuppoſition of their veſſel being captured, and a diſcovery made of their retreat. The port was doubly guarded, and the whole colony put into a ſtate of defence; but in a ſhort time their fears in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly decreaſed, and lulled in indolent ſecurity, they returned to their former courſe of luxury and diſſipation.</p>
            <p>Eleanor and Ambroſe continued to be treated as the diſtinguiſhed gueſts of the Governor; but under this maſk of kindneſs, it was eaſy to diſcern that he concealed an implacable hatred to Ambroſe,
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:035098_0131_1000B6420E118060"/>
he could not, without indignation, behold the pride and firmneſs of a youth whom he conſidered as a ſavage; the ſtrictneſs of his principles, and the ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of his arguments, always on the ſide of virtue, incenſed him; the unſhaken attachment too which he at all times diſcovered to his dear friend, and the freedom with which, even at the peril of his life, he expreſſed his ſentiments on this ſubject, was another cauſe of his diſguſt; in ſhort, his hatred aroſe to ſuch a pitch, that had it not been for Eleanor, it is probable he would have ſacrificed him to his reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. She, however, more ſoft and gentle, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated between her brother and Don Leſcar, and thus warded off the blow that might otherwiſe have proved fatal. As obſerved before, Eleanor was now nearly fifteen; ſhe was tall, and well-made; her ſun-burnt complexion was freſh as the dew; her teeth were white and regular, and her large dark eyes ſparkled with intelligence and vivacity: her hair flowed negligently in natural curls upon her ſhoulders, and there was a gentleneſs in her man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and a grace in her leaſt motion, that rendered her whole figure inexpreſſibly intereſting. Don Leſcar was ſtruck with her innocence and beauty, and from the firſt moment of her arrival conceived

the idea of making her one day his wiſe. From this cauſe had ariſen the favours he had beſtowed on her and Ambroſe; favours which they might juſtly have claimed from humanity and hoſpitality; but Don Leſcar was a ſtranger to both, and was too depraved to beſtow upon other ground<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Ambroſe and Eleanor had now more than once ſeen and communicated their griefs to the Count d'Oreſly; the good old man ſincerely ſympathized in their ſorrows, and by his counſels endeavoured to confirm them in the principles of virtue; he often pointed out to them, in the wretched inhabitants of St. Verrado, the fatal effects of luxury and intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance; "behold," ſaid he, "their features diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted, their conſtitutions undermined, their reaſon obſcured, their faculties decaying even before they have attained their due maturity, and their whole frame convulſed with paſſions which degrade them far beneath the beaſts which they deſpiſe; ſuch, my children, is the price of pleaſures which cloy in the poſſeſſion, and which are purſued more, perhaps from habit than from inclination. He then ſet before them the ſuperior advantages of a life of virtue and moderation, and thus ſtrengthened them againſt the
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:035098_0133_1000B6444AD19F70"/>
temptations to which their innocence was expoſed among the diſſipated companions with which they were daily conſtrained to aſſociate. One day, as they were as uſual, diſcourſing upon their misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and lamenting the cruel neceſſity which doom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to live under a tyrant whom they abhorred, having remained a few minutes ſilent, the Count ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed them in theſe words: "When I reflect, my children, upon the dangers to which your inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence is expoſed, and that your lives are ſcarcely ſafe in a place where you are beheld as the friend of one who is univerſally believed to be the aſſaſſin of a man, who, though ſtained with the blackeſt crimes was nevertheleſs the idol of his comrades, I feel an irreſiſtible deſire to deliver you from ſo many pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils: my own life is of little importance; in a few years I ſhall be removed to a country far beyond this circumſcribed ſpot of earth. I had reſolved to wait for this happy releaſe in St. Verrado, ſince a whimſical deſtiny had made it my abode; but your misfortunes, my children, the perils to which your innocence is expoſed, has ſhewed me the poſſibility of an eſcape, which would otherwiſe have remained undiſcovered, as unſought."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="136" facs="unknown:035098_0134_1000A3FDF61E10A0"/>
"But," ſaid Eleanor, "our dear Carlton; we muſt ſtay and take him with us."</p>
            <p>"Yes," ſaid Ambroſe, "we muſt take him, or ſtay and die with him: while a hope remains of our dear father <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> arrival, we cannot leave St. Verrado."</p>
            <p>"My dear children," ſaid the Count d'Oreſty, "your affection and gratitude charms, and intereſts me ſtill more in your behalf; but reſt aſſured, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be the cauſe, that the veſſel which you have reaſon to ſuppoſe deprived you of your friends, will never more return to St. Varrado. Don Leſcar himſelf, nay, every inhabitant of this iſland, has relinquiſhed all idea of it; who knows, therefore, Heaven may have preſerved your friends; and that misfortune (if, as is generally believed the veſſel has been captured) which may end in the deſtruction of the colony, may have brought life and liberty to them: but however this may be, you are as likely, if God permits, to meet them in other countries as in this."</p>
            <p>Eleanor and Ambroſe acknowledged the force of this argument, and were ſoon perſuaded to enter into a me ſure, which the Count aſſured them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded a much greater probability of diſcovering

their friends than remaining at St. Verrado. They expreſſed their readineſs to be guided by his advice, and enquired how he propoſed to effect their eſcape?</p>
            <p>The Count d'Oreſty did not think proper at this time to diſcloſe his plans; he only counſelled Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe to moderate his impetuoſity, and keep up a friendly intercourſe with Don Leſcar; on which he told them the ſucceſs of their enterpriſe would in a great meaſure depend: he then departed, telling them to attend every day at the port, and that when he had digeſted his plan, and arranged matters for its execution, he would talk more to them upon the ſubject.</p>
            <p>Eleanor and Ambroſe exactly followed the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of their friend: they attended regularly, at the port, but a week elapſed before they ſaw the Count d'Oreſty; at length he accoſted them: "Well, my children," ſaid he, "do you think you ſhall have courage to truſt yourſelves once more on the ſeas in your little bark?"</p>
            <p>"Ah, father," ſaid Ambroſe, "we commit ourſelves wholly to your guidance; we have loſt our dear Carlton, and think ourſelves beyond mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure

happy in meeting a friend to ſupply his place. We are very ſimple—we know nothing of the great world—It is you who muſt adviſe and direct us."</p>
            <p>"Well, my children," ſaid the Count d'Oreſty, "God, who ſees the purity of my intentions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward you, will, I hope, direct me: we muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter perils—"</p>
            <p>"Talk not of perils," interrupted Ambroſe; "tell us only what we muſt do—deliver us from Don Leſcar—from this wicked place, ſince we muſt no longer indulge the hope of ſeeing our dear father."</p>
            <p>"It is in your little bark, my children," ſaid the Count, "that we muſt attempt our eſcape; I have examined it, and find it ſolid and well built; if we can once embark, I doubt not but I ſhall be able to ſteer ſo, as to land you on ſome ſhore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited by beings leſs cruel than thoſe among whom you now reſide: from thence, if God ſpare me ſo long, I will convey you to England, where you may, perhaps, hear tidings of your friend; but much before remains to be done; your little bark, you ſee, is chained in the baſin; the keys of the port muſt therefore be obtained or we cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the enterprize. Do you think, Ambroſe,
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:035098_0137_1000B6481A734550"/>
that you would have courage to enter the apartment of Don Leſcar, and get poſſeſſion of them?"</p>
            <p>"I could have courage," ſaid Ambroſe, "to do any thing rather than live under a tyrant whom I deſpiſe and abhor—but how—"</p>
            <p>"You muſt take them," ſaid the Count, "from under the head of Don Leſcar while he ſleeps."</p>
            <p>"Oh Heaven!" exclaimed Eleanor, "ſhould he awake! my brother's life—"</p>
            <p>"Be not alarmed, Eleanor," ſaid the Count d'Oreſty, follow exactly my directions, and all will be well. If the wind, Ambroſe, continue in the ſame quarter as at preſent (for this will be neceſſary to obſerve, that it may blow us ſwiftly from the coaſt) towards evening feign an excuſe to withdraw, and ſteal privately into the chamber of Don Leſcar, where you muſt conceal yourſelf till he retires to reſt."</p>
            <p>"But," ſaid Ambroſe—"</p>
            <p>"Hear me to an end," interupted the Count<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> "you, Eleanor, take this powder, and when Don Leſcar has drunk a few glaſſes, watch a favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble opportunity, and drop a pinch of it into his

Now, my children, if you have addreſs and courage to execute this, you muſt immediately haſte with the keys to this place, where I ſhall expect you, and be ready to perform what is farther neceſſary to the ſucceſs of the enterprize."</p>
            <p>The attempt was bold and hazardous; the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of it, if not impoſſible, ſeemed difficult and replete with dangers; but Ambroſe, tranſported with the hope of eſcaping from a country which he had in horror, and alſo with the thought of viſiting England, where a probability remained of one day ſeeing his deareſt friend, if he was ſtill an inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant of the earth, promiſed every thing. Eleanor, though alarmed for the ſafety of her brother, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to perform her part, and after ſome farther arrangements concerning the execution of the plan, they returned to the palace of the Governor.</p>
            <p>Early in the evening, purſuant to the inſtructions of his friend, Ambroſe, alledging indiſpoſition,

withdrew from the preſence of Don Leſcar, and watching an opportunity, ſlipt privately into his chamber, and concealed himſelf behind the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. He left Don Leſcar, as uſual, carouſing among a number of his comrades, but as if Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven favoured the enterprize, on account of a ſlight indiſpoſition which had afflicted him for ſome days, he diſmiſſed them at an early hour. Eleanor watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a favourable opportunity, and, with a beating heart, dropt the powder given her by the Count d'Oreſty into his glaſs. Don Leſcar ſoon was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of its power, and riſing, retired to his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Let the Reader judge if poſſible what were the feelings of Eleanor at this moment; the idea of her brother being concealed in the chamber of Don Leſcar, of the dangers to which he was expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, of the double part ſhe had been acting, which obliged her to ſmile with pretended ſincerity on th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> tyrant ſhe was deceiving, all ruſhed forcibly on her mind; ſhe threw herſelf into a chair, and burſting into an agony of tears, "Oh!" ſaid ſhe, what is to be compared with ſincerity and truth!

            <p>In the mean while Don Leſcar entered his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and was ſcarcely ſtretched upon his bed, before, as the Count d'Oreſty had foretold, he ſunk into a deep ſleep, and gave Ambroſe, who boldly advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the bed, an opportunity of ſeizing the keys, which, at this moment ſeemed to him a greater treaſure than the wealth of the Indies. He then, as it had been agreed, ſtole to the apartment of his ſiſter, who was ready to expire with joy upon ſeeing him ſafe out of the chamber of Don Leſcar. Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle paſſed; he took her hand, and they eſcaped toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by a private door, of which Eleanor had the key: they flew immediately to the port where the Count d'Oreſty anxiouſly expected the ſucceſs of the undertaking. He no ſooner behold the keys, than without ſtaying to accoſt them or to diſcloſe his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, "Run, run, my friends," cried he to the guards, "the priſon is on fire, and all the priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers will eſcape."

            <p>"Can I tell, my ſon?" ſaid the Count, ſtill confuſed with the events that had occurred in ſuch quick ſucceſſion to each other. "Let us get clear of this hated land, before we talk of our rout."</p>
            <p>"Our iſland," ſaid Eleanor, "cannot be far from hence."</p>
            <p>"And what do you infer from that?" ſaid the Count.</p>
            <p>"I do not know," replied Eleanor, "but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>how I have an idea that we ſhould find our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>"Mere chimera, my child," ſaid the Count; "No, we muſt not quit an inhabited for a deſert land; we will direct our bark towards Cuba."</p>
            <p>The bark rapidly out the waves, and in a ſhort time they loſt ſight of St. Verrado; the night was dark, and neither moon nor ſtars was to be ſeen, but in a few hours the ſun began to enlighten the eaſt, and the Count perceived a number of ſmall iſlands, which he had apparently coaſted during the night

without knowing it; but the waves ſeeming to drive the bark with more violence, he was fearful of being driven into the Canal of Bahama (not doubting but that he was near it) the rapidity of which is ſo great, that it threatens inſtant deſtruction. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of this, by dint of oars and ſails, they worked the veſſel, and the next morning found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves near a coaſt, which, from the form of the buildings, and the colours of the veſſels that were in the port, the Count judged to belong to the Engliſh. How great was the joy of our voyagers? The veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel made into the port, and they landed amidſt a crowd of inhabitants, who put to them a thouſand queſtions, which the ſingularity of their dreſs, and the peculiar form of their veſſel, naturally excited: they ſoon, in their turn, learned that they were in the iſland of Providence, one of the Lucay Iſles, ſituated upon the Canal of Bahama, that it belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Engliſh, that Sir James Corpley was the Governor, and that they might expect from his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity all the ſuccour they could deſire. This was joyful information; the iſlanders readily conducted them into the preſence of the Governor; but what was the aſtoniſhment, the joy of Eleanor and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe, when, upon entering the apartment, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held

            <p>At length, becoming more calm, "to what unforeſeen event, my children," ſaid the Colonel, "do we owe this unexpected, this unhoped-for happineſs?"</p>
            <p>"Oh, my dear father," ſaid Ambroſe, "if God had not ſent us this good friend (pointing to Count d'Oreſty) who has riſked his life for our ſakes, we ſhould never have been bleſt with beholding you; he has—"</p>

What a happineſs to be thus re-united after the dangers they had encountered!

No, ſaid the ſailor, we refuſed to join in the conſpiracy againſt our Chief, who was a generous, brave man, undeſerving the fate he met with: they are afraid leſt we, in our turn, ſhould form a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy againſt them, and it is on this account they confine us. And to what port, ſaid I, are we now going? It is of little importance to us, ſaid the ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, for a council has this day deen held in which it was probably agreed to maſſacre us all. Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans! we exclaimed with one accord. It is their cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:035098_0150_1000B6588196EBE0"/>
ſaid the ſailor, the French merchant ſhip they took yeſterday was ſunk with all the men it contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, after they had pillaged the cargo, and taken out theſe unhappy women, whom the will now proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſacrifice, as they do not return to the colony to which their veſſel was bound.</p>
            <p>"The women, upon this horrid recital, broke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to violent lamentations: as for me, I patiently wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for death, which no longer appeared un welcome, after I had loſt all that could render life deſirable.</p>
            <p>"The veſſel continued its courſe till towards the middle of the next day, when it was on a ſudden vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently agitated, and we judged from the noiſe of cannon which aſſailed us on every ſide, that the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates were engaged with another veſſel, which, by the ſize of the balls that ſtruck us, ſome of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions judged to be of ſuperior force. I need not deſcribe our anxiety during the engagement, which laſted about two hours; hope and fear alternate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſeſſed us; at length our trap opened, and a ſtrange voice exclamed, <hi>You are free!</hi> immediately our irons were taken off, and we were put on board another veſſel, which proved to be Engliſh. The pirates had attempted to give chace to the Engliſh, but the Captain had made uſe of his ſuperiority to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:035098_0151_1000A41B14C4E500"/>
them; they had fought, it was ſaid, deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and did not ſtrike to the Engliſh till the greater part of their men were killed. We learnt farther that the Captain was charged with diſpatches from the Engliſh Government to its American poſſeſſions, and that he would firſt touch at the Iſle of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to the Governor of which he had letters of recall. Thus from ſlavery and death were we unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly reſtored to life and freedom: I made my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf known, and communicated my ſtory to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, who, upon our arrival at the Iſle of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, preſented me to Sir James Corpley, the Governor, with whom I had been formerly intimate in England: his reception was ſuch as might have been expected from the moſt generous of men; he was intereſted in my misfortunes, and ſince that time has detained me his diſtinguiſhed gueſt: but an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant expedition is now in agitation; ſix of the Verradian priſoners, intimidated by the threats, and allured by the promiſes of the Governor, have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed the ſituation of the iſland they inhabit, and in a few days, four hundred men, of which Sir James has given me the command, will embark, to extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate this horde of robbers, and take poſſeſſion of the iſland in the name of the Engliſh Monarch: But do
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:035098_0152_1000A422AD325000"/>
not think, my children, ſaid the Colonel to Ambroſe and Eleanor, that I was unmindful of your ſituation; I had permiſſion from my friend to touch at our iſland, little ſuſpecting that you had ventured to abandon it."</p>
            <p>The Colonel thus terminated his recital, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the thanks of all preſent. Ambroſe then recounted all that had happened ſince his ſeperation from the Colonel; and his recital was continued by the Count d'Oreſty, whoſe courage and exerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in behalf of the amiable orphans were univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally applauded. The Colonel again thanked him in the warmeſt terms, and a friendſhip from that moment took place between them, which continued to the end of their lives. The generous Governor congratulated his gueſts in the moſt polite and friendly terms upon their re-union, appointed by Providence to take place in his iſland, which on this occaſion, he obſerved, juſtified its name.</p>
            <p>The happineſs of Eleanor and Ambroſe would have been complete, had it not been embittered by the thought of a ſecond ſeparation form their friend, on account of the expedion to St. Verrado; Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe earneſtly entreated to be permitted to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany him, but the tears of his ſiſter, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Colonel, to which he had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:035098_0153_1000B65B6262CF88"/>
implicity to ſubmit, at length prevailed, and he relinquiſhed his requeſt. The Count d'Oreſty, notwithſtanding his age, made one in the expedition, juſtly conſidering that his knowledge of the iſland might forward the ſucceſs of the undertaking. Eleanor and Ambroſe accompanied their friends to the port, and with their eyes followed the little fleet, (conſiſting of three ſhips) till they could no longer diſtinguiſh it: they then returned with heavy hearts to the Governor, who uſed all his arguments to mitigate their ſears for the ſafety of their friends, and to inſpire them with the hope of their ſafe and ſpeedy return.</p>
            <p>It ſeemed as if Heaven favoured the expedition againſt St. Verrado; the weather continued favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and at the end of three days, towards mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, the little fleet arrived before the iſland; the whole colony was buried in ſleep, except the gaurds, who watched before the paliſades, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any one mounting the bank, and entering the veſſels.</p>
            <p>The ſix Verradians (who, by the promiſe of liberty and a high reward, had been prevailed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to enter into the plot) were diſpatched in the long boat, and having entered the port, made
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:035098_0154_1000A4212A781DB8"/>
themſelves known to the ſentinels, whom they amuſed with a falſe recital of their adventures, while the Colonel and his men, favoured by the darkneſs of the night, ſcaled the paliſades, fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and out them to pieces before they had time to ſound the alarm or to defend themſelves. One of the guards, however, eſcaping, ran to the city, rang the alarm, and rouſed the inhabitants, who ſcarcely awake, knew not what they meant, nor what enemies they had to encounter. The Engliſh diſperſed in the ſtreets, attacked the Verradians, as they came out of their houſes, and lighted brands ſoon ſet fire to the four corners of the city. Don Leſcar aſtoniſhed, thunderſtruck at this ſudden at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack, at length aſſembled about two hundred men, and advanced in order for battle: the ſlaughter ſoon became horrible; on one ſide, the Engliſh, armed with ſwords and bayonets, on the other, the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radians vigorouſly defending themſelves with enorm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous maſſes of bamboo<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>The bamboo here ſpoken of is not that of the Eaſt-Indies, which we frequently ſee converted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to walking canes. This plant is peculiar to the American Iſles (though not very common) and riſes to the height of thirty or forty feet, with a ſize proportionate; its trunk is furniſhed, at equal diſtances, with kno's, containing twelve or fifteen pints of liquor; its leaf very much reſembles the elder.</hi>
               </note>, preſented a ſcene of the
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:035098_0155_1000B65CE7FE4800"/>
utmoſt horror and confuſion. In the mean time, the beſieged, little formed for combat, enervated by luxury and pleaſure, firſt gave ground; and to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their defeat complete, a hundred men, which were left for that purpoſe in the ſhips, bombarded the city, and razed the citadel, the conſtruction of which was not very ſolid.</p>
            <p>In this expedition the Engliſh loſt twenty men, and the Verradians nearly three hundred men and women; for the women, laying aſide the timidity of their ſex, armed with bamboos and ſtakes, ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the midſt of the battle, and fell fighting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide their huſbands. In the midſt of the carnage fell the proud Don Leſcar, by the hand of the Count d'Oreſty: the reſt of the inhabitants having demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed quarter, the Engliſh chiefs cauſed the ſlaughter to ceaſe, and ſtopped the progreſs of the fire. Day, at length returned to diſcover the diſaſters of the
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:035098_0156_1000B65E7566BEF0"/>
night, and the Colonel ſatisfied with his expedition, thought of re-imbarking with his priſoners: but what was his conſternation! not a ſingle veſſel, not a ſingle boat was to be ſeen in the baſin. The men who were left with the little fleet, had diſperſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves over the city to aſſiſt their people, and the treacherous Verradians had ſeized this unguarded moment to ſet fire to the ſhips, as well to their own as to thoſe of the Engliſh. Both Colonel Carlton and the Count d'Oreſty had heard the exploſion cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the blowing up of the magazines of powder; they had diſtinguiſhed the Heavens red with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection of the flames; but in the heat of combat, in the confuſion that univerſally reigned, they had attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted all to the conflagration of the city, which made a rapid progreſs. An event ſo unexpected, did not a little embarraſs and mortify the Colonel; he ſaw himſelf deprived of means to return to the Iſle of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, where he had left his beloved pupils, and from whence he hoped ſhortly to embark for Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. Beſides this, he was wholly deſtitute of ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or any thing neceſſary to feed and lodge nearly four hundred of his own men, and upwards of three hundred priſoners. He was conſtrained, however, to accommodate himſelf to theſe difficulties, and as the only part there remained for him to take, order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:035098_0157_1000B6600BF6B2C8"/>
the houſes that were ſaved from the flames to be ſearched for ſail cloth, cables and tools neceſſary to conſtruct a veſſel. Theſe were happily found, and the carpenters immediately ſet to work. They la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured without intermiſſion day and night, and at the end of ſix weeks launched two little barks, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy the name of ſhips, ſufficient to contain the Colonel and about two hundred of his men, with whom he reſolved to embark, leaving the reſidue to guard the Verradian priſoners. He took with him alſo twenty-five unfortunate women, who had long groaned in the priſons of St. Verrado. But before we take leave of St. Verrado, we muſt acquaint the reader with an intereſting event, that occurred during the Colonel's continuance in the iſland. One day having viſited different parts of the city that had eſcaped the ravages of the flames, a Verradian, who was with him, pointed to the houſe of their old com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, George Blake, as the largeſt and beſt built in all the colony, excepting the Governor's. Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity induced the Colonel to enter it; he aſcended into an upper chamber, and obſerving a ſmall cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, forced it open to examine the contents. Theſe were a few jewels, and ſeveral parcels of letters and papers, which he peruſed with little attention, till the following attracted his notice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="160" facs="unknown:035098_0158_1000A4282B650628"/>
               <q>Why, my dear Eleanor, muſt I deceive the beſt of fathers! Why is he blinded by ambition? Are not virtues, titles of nobility, and the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the heart, ineſtimable treaſures? Oh, my wife, my children, why muſt I not own you? Why muſt you not find ſhelter in the arms of my venerable, my much reſpected father! but it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be. Make every thing ready for your depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; I confide you to ſafe hands; Derley accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies you, and my heart is eaſy; kiſs my Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and Ambroſe a thouſand times for me: how young they are to encounter the fatigues of ſo long a voyage! but Heaven and the tender cares of a mother will protect them. I ſhall find you all at Charles Town. Adieu, embark without unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, aſſured that nothing but death ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent an affectionate huſband from ſoon joining you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Colonel did not, the Reader will conclude, unmoved peruſe a letter, which, upon a compariſon, evidently appeared to be written by the ſame hand as that found upon Derley; the date was nearly the ſame, but it had no ſignature. He now ſearched every part of the cabinet with the minuteſt attention, and at laſt drew from a private drawer a picture of
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:035098_0159_1000A4538C5F9E28"/>
the moſt intereſting nature: it repreſented a beautiful young woman holding two children; "It is Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor! It is Ambroſe!" The Colonel called to mind their features at the time he firſt entered the uninha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited iſland, and traced the reſemblance undimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by the years that had then elapſed. Eleanor was the exact reſemblance of her mother; Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe, more maſculine, was building a houſe of cards, upon which was written, "<hi>telle eſt la vie.</hi>" What an intereſting diſcovery! The features of the woman (though freſh and lively) upon a compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, evidently reſembled thoſe delineated in the gold box of Derley; but ſtill it threw no light upon the birth of his pupils. As he viewed the intereſting miniture, a thouſand different ideas ruſhed upon his mind: By what means did theſe precious depoſits fall into the hands of the pirate? Could it be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble his amiable pupils were the offspring of a wretch ſo depraved; or had he plundered and deſtroyed their unfortunate parents? His mind floated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two ideas, when a letter, written in a woman's hand, preſented itſelf, and threw ſome light upon the matter: it was as follows:</p>
            <p>
               <q>At length, barbarian, I break the bonds in which you have for ſix months held me, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:035098_0160_1000B66331B1A248"/>
to my country; but, alas! I return deſolate and wretched, deprived by thy mercileſs hand of of all that could render life deſireable. Deteſted wretch! where are my poor children? my Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, my Ambroſe? in what corner of the earth haſt thou concealed them? Derley, the friend, the confidant of my huſband, the only ſupport of an unfortunate woman, is no more—Ah, without doubt, my children ſleep with him in the night of the tomb. Oh, inſupportable, reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on! I can no more; the moment is favourable, and I depart: but tremble, villain, the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of a juſt God will purſue thee, and deliver the earth from a monſter who contaminates it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This letter evidently had a correſpondence with the former; the names and date were the ſame, and upon a calculation, the Colonel found the time nearly approached the period in which his pupils were left upon the Iſland: he no longer doubted, though ignorant by what means, but their misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes originated from this villain, to whom it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, by the ſuperſcription, the letter was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed. Hoping to make farther diſcoveries, he enquired very particularly among the Verradians concerning their naval Chief, hoping from thence
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:035098_0161_1000A42DECC77C58"/>
to draw ſome concluſions, but he was diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; all that he could learn was, that George Blake was the Captain of an Engliſh veſſel, who upon ſome miſdemeanor had been outlawed; that having rendered ſervices to Don Leſcar, and, at laſt, aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in making his eſcape, the cloſeſt intimacy had exiſted between them, and that he was conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as the moſt daring and enterprizing of all the pirates. Not being able to gain any farther infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, the Colonel ſecured the letters and picture, and embarked for the Iſle of Providence. After five days ſail they arrived there, and were received with univerſal joy by the Governor and the whole iſland, but eſpecially by Eleanor and Ambroſe, who, alarmed at an abſence ſo much longer than was expected, began to fear both the Colonel and the Count d'Oreſty had fallen victims to the fury of Don Leſcar; but their friends were returned, and all ſorrow was baniſhed.</p>
            <p>The arrival of the Colonel with his ſuite, and the news of the victory, was celebrated with univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal demonſtrations of joy; the brave ſoldiers who fought under him were generouſly recompenſed, as well as the ſix Verradians who had been inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to the victory. The three hundred priſoners ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:035098_0162_1000B664B64AC9D8"/>
at St. Verrado were ſent to the Governor of the Spaniſh iſland of St. Domingo, as alſo a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular account of the expedition.</p>
            <p>Sir James Corpley, who was fond of ſplendid entertainments, gave one at which the ſoldiers who were ſent on the expedition to St. Verrado, and the unfortunate perſons releaſed from its priſons were preſent; nor could a ſight more intereſting be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived than this ſocial union of the heroes and the unfortunate perſons delivered by their valour.</p>
            <p>The reader will recollect that the veſſel which delivered Colonel Carlton from the hands of the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates bore letters of recall to the Governor of the Iſle of Providence. As ſoon, therefore, as he had ſettled the affairs of the iſland, as appointed by Government, he embarked for the Britiſh Iſles, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by Colonel Carlton, the Count d'Oreſty, Eleanor and Ambroſe, and the faithful Peter. With reſpect to the priſoners releaſed from the dungeons of St. Verrado, ſome of them ſettled in the Iſland of Providence, and the reſt returned to their different countries.</p>
            <p>What now could exceed the happineſs of Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and Ambroſe! returning to their country under
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:035098_0163_1000B66640AFCBE8"/>
the conduct of their dear protector and the Count d'Oreſty. The weather was favourable; the veſſel arrived happily in port, and our voyagers being fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with cloaths and every thing neceſſary to make their appearance as natives in England, ſet out poſt for the metropolis. It is not eaſy to form a juſt idea of the ſenſations of Colonel Carlton upon his arrival in a country which he had not ſeen for more than twelve years, and which contained trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, to him, of ineſtimable value. The different revolutions that might have occurred in ſo long a ſpace of time naturally preſented themſelves to his mind, and alternately agitated him with hope and fear: he had left a wife and child whom he tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loved—but death might long ſince have conſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to the grave; or a ſecond marriage, upon the ſuppoſition of his death, might have embittered the remainder of his days. As he drew near Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don his fears encreaſed, and while every one was elate with joy and gladneſs, he was melancholy and dejected. Upon his arrival, he went immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to the houſe of a relation, where he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that ſince his ſuppoſed death, Mrs. Carlton had retired to a villa a few miles from the metropolis,
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:035098_0164_1000A430F1B16B98"/>
where, with her ſon, ſhe lived wholly ſecluded from the great world. How grateful was this to the heart of the Colonel! Accompanied by his two pupils and the Count d'Oreſty, he immediately ſet out for the village, and towards evening arrived at an inn about a mile from the houſe where Mrs. Carlton reſided. Here he alighted and remained with Ambroſe and Eleanor while the Count d'Oreſty took upon himſelf the neceſſary office of preparing Mrs. Carlton for his reception. He introduced himſelf to her as a friend of the Colonel's, and mentioned at a diſtance a report of a few having been preſerved from the wreck; then having inſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her with hope, he ventured to tell her that letters had been received from ſome of the crew; but when he announced the certainty of her huſband's ſafety, and, at laſt, that he was actually in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, notwithſtanding the caution with which it had been revealed, her ſurprize and joy was ſo great, that the Count did not think it prudent to acquaint her he was ſo near, but contented himſelf, as the day was far advanced, with promiſing her an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view the next morning. The deſcription he gave the Colonel, on his return to the inn, of his Lady's emotions on the unexpected news of his arrival, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded him heart-felt pleaſure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="167" facs="unknown:035098_0165_1000B667C5C53BE0"/>
The next morning early, the whole group was aſſembled at the manſion of Mrs. Carlton, who was already up, and, with her ſon, a promiſſing youth of ſixteen, impatiently a waiting the arrival of her huſband. The meeting was too affecting to admit of deſcription: the Colonel alternately preſſed to his boſom his wife and ſon, and in the exceſs of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs he enjoyed, forgot the years of anguiſh that were paſſed, or remembered them only to heighten his preſent joy. The firſt tranſports of meeting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over, the Colonel preſented Eleanor and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe to his lady, telling her with a ſmile, they were his adopted children, and that he hoped and truſted ſhe would not find them undeſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her protection. The eſteem of the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel was a ſufficient recommendation to Mrs. Carl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton; though unacquainted with their ſtory, ſhe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially embraced, and preſented them to her ſon Charles, who aſſured his father he ſhould from that moment conſider them as his brother and ſiſter. In her turn, Mrs. Carlton introduced to the Colonel, by the name of Millar, a worthy clergyman, who had undertaken the care of their ſon's education, as alſo a gentlewoman, about the age of thirty five, as the companion of her widowed hours. "Had it
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:035098_0166_1000A43406DED9A0"/>
not been for my worthy friend," ſaid ſhe, "I muſt have ſunk under the weight of my affliction; but her example taught me fortitude a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d reſignation; I looked for conſolation to religion, and to a happy eternity, for the felicity I deſpaired of taſting here."</p>
            <p>The joy of Eleanor and Ambroſe, on ſeeing their generous protector thus happily re-united to his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, was ſuch as might be expected from the ſuſcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of their hearts: their eye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s were alternately fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Colonel, Mrs. Carlton, and Charles, never wearied with contemplating the happineſs that was expreſſed in the countenance of each. The Count d'Oreſty, and all preſent, ſhared in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral joy; and it was not, perhaps, poſſible to find a happier group than that aſſembled at the breakfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table of Mrs. Carlton. The adventures of the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, at length, became the topic of converſation, and at the requeſt of his Lady and friends, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the principal events that had occurred ſince he left England; he mentioned his ſhipwreck on the uninhabited iſland, his diſcovery of Eleanor and Ambroſe, and did not forget the many little incidents that occurred to illuſtrate the goodneſs and ſimplicity of their hearts. This part of the narrative ſeemed to make a ſingular impreſſion on the Lady, whom Mrs.
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:035098_0167_1000B66A99D743D0"/>

The Colonel produced them; and the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger immediately exclaimed, "My children!" and fell back ſenſeleſs in her chair. All aroſe in haſte to give the neceſſary aſſiſtance; ſhe revived; and Eleanor and Ambroſe, no longer doubting but they had found their mother, threw themſelves on their knees before her: "Yes," ſaid ſhe, bending on them an eye of tender ſcrutiny, "it is my Eleanor—my Ambroſe too! the living image of his lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed father; my heart from the firſt moment I beheld him, pointed out the reſemblance; but could I think!'—and here ſhe ſtopped, overcome with ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations too great for words to expreſs. Ambroſe and Eleanor, while alternately embraced by their mother, mingled tears of gratitude and affection with thoſe ſhe ſhed over them. The ſtriking reſemblance (allowing for the difference of years) between Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and her mother, was now univerſally obſerved,

and every one wondered it had not before ſtruck him; yet an event ſo far exceeding the bounds of human probability, could ſcarcely obtain credit from any, excepting Mrs. Carlton, who, being acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſtory of her friend, entertained no doubt but that Providence had re-united her to her children. To remove every doubt, the Colonel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the letters and picture he had found in the houſe of George Blake; theſe were immediately known by Mrs. Carlton's friend, who being ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently recovered, ſatisfied the company, by relating the particulars of her hiſtory. Her words were as follow:—</p>
            <p>"I am the daughter of an officer; my father was deſcended from an ancient family, but inherited on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a ſmall patrimony; he had ſerved many cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigus, but ſoon after the death of my mother, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired from the army in diſguſt upon a ſmall annuity: this, from the embarraſſments of the perſon in whoſe hands it was placed, after a few years ceaſed, and my father, at an advanced age, found himſelf reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a poverty, his high ſpirit was ill formed to brook.</p>
            <p>"Our ſupport depended chiefly upon a young man, an orphan, whom my father in happier days

had brought up and placed with a jeweller: forgive the tear I ſhed to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>his memory; to me his affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was that of the kindeſt brother; to my father, of the moſt duteous and affectionate ſon. Derley ſhared with us the pittance he obtained by induſtry, which, joined to the little I gained from my needle, preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us from the extremities of want. But greater diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs ſoon followed; Derley, from a variety of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents too tedious to relate, and ſome debts he had contracted on our account, was thrown into a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and my father who was reduced by a long ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, grew ſo bad, that his life was deſpaired of. Overwhelmed by this accumulated diſtreſs, I was one evening returning with ſome work from a ſhop that employed me, when, in paſſing through a retir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtreet, I could not forbear giving vent to my tears, which in the preſence of my father I felt my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf obliged to ſuppreſs; but I cannot deſcribe to you how much I was humbled and confuſed, upon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving that my grief had drawn upon me the notice of a young man, who, as I afterward found, had for ſome time followed me. He addreſſed me in the moſt reſpectful terms, and enquired into the cauſe of my grief, adding, "Do not ſuppoſe that any other motive than concern for the unfortunate prompts my curioſity, perhaps I may alleviate your diſtreſs.
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:035098_0170_1000B66DD84D5810"/>
I replied, that my grief was not of a nature for him to alleviate, and that the only favour he could do me was to ſuffer me to paſs unnoticed. Saying this, I quickned my pace; but the ſtranger ſtill following urged me, though in terms of great delicacy, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept his friendſhip, at the ſame time offering me his purſe. Great as our diſtreſs was, I was not yet ſufficiently humbled to accept of pecuniary relief from a ſtranger; nor, indeed, would prudence have permitted it: I returned the thanks due to his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity, but refuſed to accept any thing, and being arrived at our own door, wiſhed him a good night. Upon entering, I found that an alarming change had taken place in my dear father, who ſurvived only till the next evening. You who have hearts alive to the feelings of humanity can better imagine than I can deſcribe my ſituation: deprived of a father whom I regretted, not only as the parent who had given me birth, but as the friend who had guided my youth; Derley, my only remaining friend, abſent, languiſhing in a priſon, unable either to conſole or adviſe me! I was overwhelmed with the weight of theſe afflictions, when the unexpected entrance of Derly, for a moment, ſuſpended my grief; my heart gathered ſtrength from the preſence of my beſt friend, and I aroſe to communicate, in terms of as
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:035098_0171_1000B66F81587B80"/>
much gentleneſs as my own grief would permit, the loſs we had mutually ſuſtained. Derley was ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and affected to tears; for ſome moments he gave vent to the emotions of his grateful heart, and then turning to me, endeavoured to give me the conſolation he himſelf wanted: at length we became more calm, and I enquired by what unexpected means he had obtained his releaſe? He replied that a generous ſtranger, of whoſe name and quality he was ignorant, had by ſome means gained intelligence of his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, paid the debt, and encloſed for him a bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note of ten pounds. The idea of the ſtranger who had accoſted me the preceding evening, immediately ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon my mind; I communicated to Derley what had paſſed between us, and he agreed with me that it might be the ſame, though we were at a loſs to conceive how he had gained the knowledge of our ſituation.</p>
            <p>"Having performed the laſt melancholy duties to my dear father's remains, I began to think of look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out for a ſituation in which I might provide for my own ſubſiſtence, ſenſible that I could not long with propriety remain under the protection of Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley. About a week after the funeral of my father,

<pb n="174" facs="unknown:035098_0172_1000B672A4394CD8"/>
the generous ſtranger introduced himſelf to Derley, as a friend willing to render him any father ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces his ſituation might require: I was preſent, and knowing him to be the ſame that had accoſted me, could not do leſs than expreſs myſelf obliged by his civilities. Upon enquiring, we learnt that he had obtained a knowledge of our ſituation from the woman in whoſe houſe we lodged. From this time he called often, and his viſits at laſt became ſo frequent, that Derley, the watchful guardian of my youth, was alarmed, and would abſolutely have forbidden them, had not the ſtranger, foreſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his intentions, profeſſed his views to be honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Young and unexperienced, I too readily liſtened to his addreſſes, thoughtleſs of the obſtacles that muſt attend our union, for we ſoon learnt that our benefactor was the only ſon of the Count d'<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>Oreſty, the Ambaſſador from France."</p>
            <p>The Colonel and his pupils at this moment turned their eyes upon their venerable friend with ſurprize and enquiry; nor was the Count himſelf unmoved. The mother of Eleanor and Ambroſe ſtopped—but the Count looking ſignificantly at the reſt, and making a ſign that ſhe ſhould go on, ſhe continued. "Thoughtleſs of the conſequences,
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:035098_0173_1000A4432EC9EF90"/>
inſtead of reſtraining my inclinations, and ſetting before M. d'Oreſty the duties he owed his father, and the evils that muſt attend his diſobedience, I liſtened to his addreſſes, and conſented to a private marriage, fooliſhly amuſing myſelf with the hope that he would find means to reconcile his father to the imprudent ſtep he had taken. A houſe was hired in a retired part of the town, and we lived together in mutual harmony; but happineſs was far from being our gueſt; the idea of the troubles in which I was ſenſible I muſt involve my huſband, ſhould his father, who I now underſtood inherited all the pride of high birth and deſigned him for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, prove inflexible, continually alarmed, and made me wretched. Theſe reflections, which I ought to have made before it had been too late, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermined my peace, though they did not repair my errors. A few months after our marriage, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved a gloom on the countenance of my huſband, and enquiring the cauſe, he told me that his father, having learnt that a connexion exiſted between us, had declared that if it tended to marriage, he would certainly diſinherit him. This entirely fruſtrated his deſign of diſcloſing his marriage, which he now thought it neceſſary more cloſely to conceal: our
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:035098_0174_1000B6742B46DB80"/>
reſidence was changed, and ſoon after I brought into the world twins; my Eleanor and Ambroſe were born. More than three years elapſed, and all ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of our union had died away when my huſband one evening returned with the dreadful tidings that his father had ordered him to embark in a few weeks for France, to forward his nuptials with the daughter of the French miniſter, for whom he had from his infancy been deſigned. I need not tell you the anguiſh this communicated to my heart, nor was my poor d'Oreſty leſs affected: I wept, and my huſband, who well knew the inflexibility of his father, had ſcarcely a word of conſolation to offer me. We parted that evening without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving upon any thing, but the next, he met me with the appearance at leaſt of more ſerenity; he told me that finding it impoſſible without the utter ruin of us all to diſcover his marriage to his father, he could think of no way but to embark immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately for South Carolina, and ſolicit the interfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of an uncle who reſided there, and who had great influence with his father. The tender age of my children made me alive to all the perils and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues they muſt encounter; I repreſented theſe to M. d'Oreſty, and endeavoured to diſſuade him from
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:035098_0175_1000B675B29EB1C8"/>
the voyage, eſpecially as I conceived the interfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his uncle might be equally as well obtained by letter; but poor d'Oreſty thought otherwiſe; he imagined that his uncle, and every one muſt ſee with the eyes he did, and thought the preſence of his wife and children would plead more powerfully than volumes. His firſt deſign was to embark with us, but the difficulty he found in diſengaging himſelf, without creating ſuſpicions which he wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to avoid, made him relinquiſh the idea, and it was determined that I ſhould embark with the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Derley, and await his arrival at Charles-Town. Finding that his heart was ſet upon the voyage, I ſubmitted, and in leſs than three weeks ſet out under the conduct of Derley, with the children and a female ſervant, for Plymouth, from whence we were to embark with the firſt fair wind. The letter you found in the pocket of poor Derley I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from my huſband the day before we left London.</p>
            <p>"As the winds were contrary, upon our arrival at Plymouth, we took up our reſidence at the inn, where we remained above a week; during this time we had frequent viſits from the Captain of the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel

We had not been many days at ſea before I obſerved a familiarity in his manners that diſguſted me; but judge what was my indignation when he had the preſumption to profeſs a paſſion for me. I retorted in the language my wounded pride dictated and the inſult deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; to which he, with the utmoſt coolneſs return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed "that the offer of his hand, which he freely made me could not be conſtrued into an inſult, eſpecially as I muſt conſider that he was ſole maſter in the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and conſequently that I was in his power," I now ſaw the villain I had to deal with, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting by the hint that I was in his power, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to remonſtrate with leſs <hi>haut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I will not attempt to deſcribe what I felt upon reading this letter; my anguiſh aroſe to a pitch that bordered upon madneſs. When I caſt my eyes round, and ſaw myſelf ſhut out from the poſſibility of flying to my huſband, and learnt, that had it not been for the blackeſt treachery, I might have arrived time enough to have taken a laſt farewell of him; for Blake made no ſcruple of confeſſing, that though I was on board when the meſſenger arrived, we had not weighed anchor, attributing what he had done to
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:035098_0178_1000B67BB8F65DF0"/>
the violence of his paſſion, as he underſtood from the meſſenger whom he had accoſted upon the beech, that it contained an expreſs for me to return to London. For ſome hours I actually loſt the uſe of my reaſon, which ſo alarmed the wretch who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted me, that he left me to the care of Derley, who in vain ſtrove to ſoothe and reconcile me to my misfortunes. Time, however, and the tender cares of a mother, affected what argument could not; my reaſon returned, and the innocent prattle of my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren diverted my thoughts from a calamity, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection of which drove me almoſt to phrenzy; but I had more yet to endure. I was again perſecuted by the odious addreſſes of Blake, from which Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley in vain endeavoured to defend me. He grew impatient, and to intreaties added threats of the moſt horrid nature. Alarmed at my ſituation, I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to diſſemble, thinking, that when we arrived at Charles-Town, the place to which the veſſel was bound, I ſhould eaſily rid myſelf of his importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. He, however, more ſkilled in artifice than I was, ſaw through my drift, and finding that Derley would ever remain an obſtacle to his views, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to be rid of him at the firſt opportunity: nor was this all; my innocent children became the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:035098_0179_1000A44A27A95DB8"/>
of his deteſtation, from the ſuppoſition, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that they kept alive in my heart the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of their father; at leaſt I can aſſign no other reaſon for the dreadful ſcene I am going to relate. We had been at ſea about ſeven weeks, when one morning as I was ſitting with my children, one on one knee, and the other on the other, weeping, and talking with Derley on the events that were paſt, Blake came into the cabin: he renewed the uſual theme, mingling threats with promiſes, till finding I paid no attention to his diſcourſe, but ſtill wept on, and embraced my children, he ſuddenly ſtarted up, and ſnatching them from my arms, threw them with violence on the floor. Derley, who was attached to the children, incenſed at this act of brutality, yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the impulſe of the moment, ſeized him by the throat; an affront which Blake revenged by drawing a ſhort ſword, and ſtabbing him, as I thought, to the heart. At the inſtant, five or ſix men came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the cabin, and at a ſignal given, ſeized Derley, while others, notwithſtanding my prayers, tears, and frantic endeavours to prevent it, bore away the children. What were all my former troubles to the anguiſh of this moment! I fancied I heard the cries of my children under the hands of their murderers,
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:035098_0180_1000B67D4317FE00"/>
yet was unable to fly to their reſcue; I endeavoured to force the door of the cabin, but finding my efforts vain, I ſunk down inſenſible and remember no more till I found myſelf on my bed, my ſervant ſitting by me. I called aloud for my children, my Ambroſe—my Eleanor, and was in vain aſſured that they were in ſafety—that they were left with Derley on an iſland we had coaſted; I gave no credit to the tale, believing it fabricated merely to amuſe me, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as I found my ſervant was in the intereſt of Blake. I will not trouble you with all I ſuffered dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the voyage; ſuffice it to ſay, that we arrived at Charles-Town, where I hoped to eſcape the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of my perſecutor, but I was miſtaken; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pretence that I was his niece, and deranged in my intellects, he conveyed me to his houſe, and committed me to the care of my treacherous ſervant, whom he had ſuborned to his intereſt. Six months I was cloſely confined, but at the end of that time, through the aſſiſtance of an honeſt labourer who worked in grounds adjacent, I effected my eſcape, and having fortunately concealed about my perſon bank notes to the amount of a hundred and fifty pounds, engaged for my paſſage in a veſſel that was on the point of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ailing for England.</p>

               <pb n="183" facs="unknown:035098_0181_1000B67EC914D828"/>
"You will, perhaps, think that my firſt ſtep ought to have been that of communicating my ſtory to the magiſtrates of the town, and claiming their protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but if you knew what I had ſuffered, how much my ſpirits were depreſſed, and what reaſon I had to dread the machinations of the wretch by whom I was perſecuted, you will ceaſe to wonder at my conduct. My ſole object was to return to England, either to meet my huſband, (which ſeemed within the bounds of poſſibility) or to die there in obſcurity.</p>
            <p>With theſe ideas I embarked; but on my arrival ſoon learnt, as I had reaſon to preſage, that my huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band was no more. He expired, as far as I could judge from the vague information I collected, a few hours after the meſſenger was diſpatched to me; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven before the arrival of his father, who ſet off for Bath on the morning on which the duel was fought. I learnt alſo, that the Count d'Oreſty, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of his affliction, had ſolicited his recall, and had returned to France a few weeks after the death of his ſon.</p>
            <p>"All my hopes of happineſs were now at an end, and I reſolved, in ſome quiet family, to ſeek an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble eſtabliſhment, where I could perform the duties of my ſtation, and prepare for the quitting of a world

which had for me no longer any charms. The perſon at whoſe houſe I lodged, underſtanding my intention, mentioned a lady, who ſhe ſaid was on the point of retiring into the country, and wanted a perſon capable of being a companion, and at the ſame time of aſſiſting in the management of her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. Need I ſay that it was my dear Mrs. Carlton? I was introduced to her and immediately engaged. In due time I related to her my unhappy ſtory, and experienced her generous ſympathy: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſhe treated me with the affection of a ſiſter, and could I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten my children—my huſband—my friend—torn from me by the moſt perverſe and cruel deſtiny, I might have been happy. She preſſed me to make myſelf known to the family of my huſband, offered me money for the purpoſe, nay would have accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied me to France; but I declined her generous offers; I knew not whether the father of my huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band was acquainted with his indiſcretions, and as I had not children to prompt my ambition, or to call forth my exertions, I wiſhed not to fully his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory with the revival of follies which originated on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his too great partiality for me. Twelve years have paſſed, not unprofitably away; religion has taught me to moderate both my griefs and my

reſentment, and reconciled me to a life which I once thought inſupportable."</p>
            <p>Here Madam d'Oreſty ceaſed—and the Count, riſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from his ſeat, looked with reverence toward Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and exclaimed, "<hi>Wonderful are thy works, Oh God, and thy ways paſt finding out.</hi>" Then taking Madam d'Oreſty by the hand, <q>What a train of intereſting events, ſaid he, have you unfolded! In me behold the father of your huſband; in me, my children,</q> turning to Ambroſe and Eleanor, "behold your grandſire,"</p>
            <p>The Colonel, his pupils, and indeed the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in general, had been prepared by the aſpect and geſtures of the Count; to expect ſomething extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary; but Madam d'Oreſty, abſorbed in the recital of her calamities, and commanding only a ſide view of him from the ſeat ſhe occupied, heard this declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with inexpreſſible wonder. She viewed the Count a moment in ſilent aſtoniſhment: but ſoon recollecting the character in which ſhe ſtood before him, ſhe covered her face with her hands, and bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forward, ſeemed to await the reproaches ſhe conſidered due to her from the father of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</p>

               <pb n="186" facs="unknown:035098_0184_1000A450843A5620"/>
The Count was affected by this intereſting atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, too expreſſive to be miſunderſtood, and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her hand, aſſured her he ſhould henceforth conſider her not only as the widow of his ſon, but as the daughter of his affection. "You appear, ſaid he, "too ſenſible of your errors to permit me to animadvert upon them; we have none of us been blameleſs; myſelf not the leaſt; the reſerve and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity with which, from his infancy I treated my ſon, repulſed rather than invited the confidence of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, while the authority I aſſumed over his inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made him loſe the reſpect due to me as a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; but his errors have been ſignally puniſhed; let the grave cover them, and may they prove a uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful leſſon to his children. Early my dear Ambroſe, and you, my ſweet Eleanor, learn to reſtrain your inclinations, and to keep them within the bounds of moderation; remember, my children, that the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of a moment may be followed by years of anxiety and pain."</p>
            <p>The Count then embraced Eleanor and Ambroſe, who threw themſelves upon their knees to implore his bleſſing. The converſation then turning upon paſt events, the Count confirmed what Madam d'Oreſty had heard concerning the death of her huſband. "I

I will not attempt to deſcribe my grief; he was my only child, and Heaven is witneſs how dear! The country became hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to me: I ſolicited my recall, and returned to France. It happened ſoon after that I had letters from Cuba, acquainting me with the death of an old friend, who had left me his poſſeſſions there: I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the voyage, thinking an entire change of objects might diſſipate the melancholy which ſince the death of my ſon had taken poſſeſſion of my ſoul. I arrived, and remained there ſome months, when Blake, as the Colonel has before related, deſcended upon the iſland, and bore me, among the number aſſembled in his veſſel, to St. Verrado." Here the Count ceaſed, and joined with every one preſent in admiring the wonderful chain of events by which Providence had united them.</p>
            <p>The Count had paſſed about a week at the manſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his friend, when he began to think of embark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for France, to ſee after his eſtates.

Charles and Ambroſe, between whom a friendſhip founded upon mutual virtues had already taken place, looked at each other and ſmiled, while the eyes of Eleanor met thoſe of her mother and Mrs. Carlton ſparkling with pleaſure; in ſhort, the propoſal was univerſally reliſhed, and in leſs than a month they all embarked for France. The Count upon arriving found that his eſtates ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the hands of his agent: for as no certain tidings of his death had tranſpired, no claim had been made. The Reader need not be told that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel and his family were the gueſts of the Count d'Oreſty; during three months which their viſit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, he ſpared no polite and friendly attention to render it agreeable; they made an excurſion to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, from which the Count's ſeat was a few leagues diſtant, and were gratified with the view of every thing that celebrated city contained deſerving the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the curious. They viſited the Louvre, the Thuilleries, the Palace of Orleans, celebrated for its valuable collection of paintings, and the Gobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, a famous manufactory of tapeſtry, which takes its name from one Goblie, a noted dyer of Reims, who lived in the reign of Francis the Firſt.

Ambroſe and Eleanor were intereſted in every thing they ſaw; the perfection to which the arts had ariſen ſtruck them with wonder and delight; for though ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the principles of each, they had form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no idea of the powerful effects produced by them when applied by genius and induſtry: in the mean while, they conciliated the affection of heir mother and grandfather by a thouſand inſtances of their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility and the goodneſs of their hearts; the Count became daily more attached to them, and they in return omitted nothing that might expreſs their gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and affection. After three months ſpent in the pleaſures of ſocial intercourſe, the Colonel prepared to return with his family to England, when an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected event retarded his departure, and plunged every one in the deepeſt ſorrow.

His loſs was ſincerely regreted by every one but eſpecially by Ambroſe and Eleanor, who had flattered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with long enjoying his paternal care, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by their conduct the grateful ſenſe they entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of his kindneſs. Nor was Madam d'Oreſty leſs affected: ſhe regreted him with all the warmth of gratitude and friendſhip his generous conduct toward

her and her children merited; indeed his attachment to them was manifeſted to the laſt act of his life; for being alarmed at the ſymptoms of his diſorder, he ſent for a notary and in the preſence of the Colonel and Mrs. Carlton made his will, in which he nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated Ambroſe his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> heir, and provided amply for Eleanor and her mother: but this acquiſition of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence, far from mitigating, encreaſed the grief they felt for the loſs of their friend, by adding ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the proofs they had already received of his friendſhip and affection.</p>
            <p>As the Colonel was nominated executor to the Count's will, as alſo guardian to Eleanor and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe, his preſence was neceſſary to arrange their affairs: he remained, therefore, ſome time longer in France, till having ſettled every thing to his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, he embarked for England, accompanied by Madam d'Oreſty and his pupils, who joyfully accepted the invitation he gave of paſſing the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Winter in England<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after a pleaſant voyage they arrived; and in the ſociety of their friends be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to reſume their wonted chearfulneſs, when an event the moſt diſtreſſing and unexpected turned all their joy to the bittereſt anguiſh. The Reader muſt recollect that Sir<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> James Corpley had ſent the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:035098_0189_1000A4571E1B2F10"/>
taken at St. Verrado to the Governor of the Spaniſh iſland St. Domingo, with an account of the expedition, and his reaſons for undertaking it: theſe reaſons, however, did not ſatisfy the Court of Spain; the deſtruction of the Colony was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued into an infringement upon the rights of the Spaniſh Crown, and remonſtrances made to the Britiſh Cabinet. The inhabitants of St. Verrado were in vain repreſented as a banditti, to whoſe depredations all Europe was ſubject; the honour of the Spaniſh Court was thought to be concerned, and ſatisfaction demanded. In ſhort, after various negotiations between the Courts, it was at laſt ſettled to puniſh the aggreſſors, <abbr>viz.</abbr> Sir James Corpley and the Colonel, with exile. This was an unexpected ſtroke: the joy which had for ſome months before enlivened the manſion of the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel was no more. Eleanor wept; Ambroſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed loudly againſt the ſentence, which, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the repreſentations of the Colonel, he could not help thinking unjuſt, and both declared they would follow their protector to the end of the earth. Madam d'Oreſty ſaid the ſame to her friend Mrs. Carlton, who felt rather on her huſbands, than her own account, obſerving that it was of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle importance what country ſhe inhabited, if ſhe
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:035098_0190_1000A468904A5960"/>
had the ſociety of her huſband, ſon, and friend. "Ah," ſaid Eleanor, "would to Heaven we were all together in our iſle!" This exclamation, utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without deſign, gave birth to an idea in the mind of the Colonel, which ſoon became the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite topic of converſation: this was no other than the founding of a coloney in the iſland which had ſo long ſerved him and his pupils as a retreat. He mentioned it to Sir James Corpley who imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately entered into it, and pointed out the proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Government approving and encouraging ſuch a plan; in ſhort, they united their intereſts, obtained the permiſſion and encouragement they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, and began to arrange every thing for the founding of a new colony. Madam d'Oreſty and her children ſtill expreſſing their reſolution of join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their fate with that of their friends, the Colonel thought proper to ſet before them the advantages they would forego by quitting a civilized country, where every enjoyment affluence could purchaſe awaited them, for one unfrequented, in which they muſt wait ſome years, at leaſt, even for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences of life; he ſaid all that the moſt generous and diſintereſted mind could dictate upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but Madam d'Oreſty, to the inexpreſſible joy
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:035098_0191_1000B68ACD366E58"/>
of Ambroſe and Eleanor, declared, that as it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incided with the inclinations of her children, her reſolution was fixed, and that ſhe had no higher ambition than to live and die with her friend.</p>
            <p>In about ſix months all was ready for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, and Sir James Corpley, the Colonel, Mrs. Carlton, Charles, Madam d'Oreſty, her children, the worthy Mr. Millar, and honeſt Peter, embark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Portſmouth, with about ſix hundred perſons, men and women, who willingly followed as ſett<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers in the new Government. The voyage was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable; after a few weeks ſail they drew near the Antillis, and Ambroſe and Eleanor began to ſearch with wiſhful eyes for the iſland which had been the aſylum of their youth: at length, the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel directing its courſe eaſtward of Jamaica, they diſcerned from far the point of a rock which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed familiar to them: the veſſel approches: it is the ſame; it is their beloved iſle. They behold the melancholy veſtiges of the foreſt deſtroyed by the conflagration; the ſhore where they had fabricated the little bark in which alone and unprotected they had tempted the dangers of the ſea: they land, and feel a thouſand pleaſing ſenſations on finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves again in an iſland in which, though they had
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:035098_0192_1000A460C4191A50"/>
experienced ſome painful moments, they had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed years of peace and tranquility. Every ſpot is viſited; the place where their cabin ſtood; the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern in which Derley expired; the grot where ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Peter was preſerved; nor will it be aſked if they viſited the little mount covered with myrrh trees; they are already with their mother at the foot of the monument erected with their own hands to the memory of Derley, ſhedding with her the tear of gratitude and affection.</p>
            <p>In a ſhort time the ground is cleared, and broken up; buildings ariſe; fortifications, even a port iſſues from the hands of the new coloniſts, and in leſs than four years they had ſhelter, cultivated fields, in a word, all the conveniences of life. Sir James Corpley and the Colonel, who were nominated joint Governors, in conjunction formed a code of laws, which were tendered to, and univerſally approved by the people; they governed the Colony with that juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and moderation which formed the baſis of their character; and the ſame of their wiſdom, and of the happineſs enjoyed under their adminiſtration ſoon reaching England, they had the pleaſure of ſeeing the new Colony daily encreaſe, and at length become one of the moſt flouriſhing; it was called the <hi>Iſle of

Twins,</hi> in memory of the deſertion of the children, and the ſign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d protection afforded them by Heaven. Not long after the arrival of the new Coloniſts, ſome Carribes, according to their uſual cuſtom, landed on the iſland; at the ſight of the Europeans they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked precipitately in their canoes, but the Colonel wiſhing to put ſome queſtions to them, ordered ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to be detained: the account they gave of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition into the iſland; once in three years, was nearly the ſame as that given by Peter: but they added, they often ſtayed ſeveral days in the iſland, during which they planted maize and other grain, in the hope of finding it multiplied at their next viſit. This ſingular cuſtom explained to the Colonel what he had till now conſidered as a myſtery, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the finding, on his firſt arrival in the iſland, entire plains of maize and a variety of vegetable productions, which required the pains of culture, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not to be expected in an uninhabited land: but to return. A few years after their arrival in the iſland, the Colonel and Mrs. Carlton had the ſatisfaction of ſeeing their ſon Charles united to Eleanor; and ſoon after Ambroſe made choice of a young lady, the niece of Sir James Corpley, univerſally eſteemed for her amiable diſpoſition and perſonal accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Honeſt Peter enjoyed the tranquility his
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:035098_0194_1000B68DDCEE7E80"/>
years required and his ſervices merited; he died at an advanced age, a few years after their arrival in the iſland, and was buried at the ſide of Derley, to whoſe memory a ſuperb monument was erected. The worthy Mr. Millar lived univerſally reſpected, and by his virtues did honour to the religion he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed and maintained in the Colony. Madam d'Oreſty and her friend Mrs. Carlton had the pleaſure of ſeeing their friendſhip perpetuated in their children, who, by their conduct, d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ily rendered themſelves more worthy their affection. In ſhort, all theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy characters in this delightful retreat enjoyed the tranquility which is the reſult only of virtue.</p>
            <p>Ambroſe and Eleanor through life entertained for their preceptor that tender reſpect and gratitude his conduct toward them juſtly merited, and their hearts were ſo well formed to pay: they looked up to him as to the parent who had foſtered and to the friend who had guided their youth, ever bearing in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, that the happineſs they enjoyed in ſociety was the fruit of thoſe precepts they had imbibed from him in ſolitude.</p>

            <byline>By Miſs HELEN MARIA WILLIAMS.</byline>
            <p>A FRIEND of mine who is lately gone to Toulouſe, has ſent me from thence an account of ſome circumſtances which happened not long ago in that part of France, and which, ſhe ſays, are ſtill much the ſubject of converſation. I ſhall tranſcribe this narrative, which I believe will intereſt you. Perhaps a novel-writer, by the aid of a little additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal miſery, and by giving the circumſtances which actually happened a heightened colour—by taking his pallet, and daſhing with the full glow of red, what nature had only tinged with pale violet, might almoſt ſpin a volume from theſe materials. Yet, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, nothing is ſo affecting as ſimplicity, and nothing ſo forcible as truth. I ſhall therefore ſend

               </gap> effect. In ſome parts of the narrative you will meet with a little ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance; but perhaps you will wonder that you meet with no more; ſince the ſcene is not in the cold phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophic climate of England, but in the warm regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the ſouth of France, where the imagination is elevated, where the paſſions acquire extraordinary energy, and where the fire of poetry flaſhed from the harps of the Troubadours, amid the ſullen gloom of the Gothic ages.</p>
            <p>A young Frenchman, whoſe uſual reſidence was at Paris, having travelled as far as Toulouſe the year before the revolution, was invited by a party of his friends to accompany them to Bareges, where ſome of them were going in purſuit of amuſement, and others in ſearch of health from the medical ſprings which riſe ſo plentifully, both in hot and cold ſtreams, among the Pyrenean mountains.</p>
            <p>This young Pariſian, who had ſome taſte for the ſublime ſcenery of nature, felt that it would be lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury to leave a little longer the regular walks which

            <p>Bareges was crouded, as it uſually is in the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, not only with French company, but alſo with ſtrangers, who travel from other countries, in order to uſe its celebrated baths. The company amuſed themſelves, as they generally do at water-drinking places, by ſauntering, lounging, cards, lotteries, jeux-d'eſprit, and ſcandal.</p>
            <p>Bareges is a very expenſive place. Even mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate accommodations muſt be purchaſed at a high
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:035098_0198_1000A484AB176AF8"/>
rate; and proviſions, as well as lodgings, are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times obtained with difficulty. Bareges is therefore ſeldom reſorted to by any but people of conſiderable fortune, who can afford to level the obſtacles which mountains interpoſe to their conveniences and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, by the all ſubduing force of gold.</p>
            <p>Among a number of perſons of rank and fortune, there was however, one family at Bareges in a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſituation. This family conſiſted of an elderly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm French officer, who had long been afflicted with the palſy, and his daughter, a young woman about nineteen years of age. Their appearance and mode of living ſeemed to indicate, that, though in ſearch of relief this old officer had journed to Bareges, he had in ſo doing far exceeded the bounds of econo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my which his circumſtances preſcribed, and was forced to deny himſelf every accommodation his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities could ſpare. He lived in the moſt retired manner, in the worſt lodging at Bareges;—and while the other ladies were dreſſed in a ſtyle of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive variety and profuſion, his daughter wore on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a plain linen gown, which though always per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly clean, was coarſe; and her dark hair was left unpowdered, and without any ornament whatever. Fortunately for Madelaine, however (for that was
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:035098_0199_1000A487EA6155B0"/>
her name) her perſon was calculated to make her coarſe gown appear to the beſt advantage; and though ſhe was not very beautiful, her countenance had an expreſſion of ſweetneſs which anſwered the end of beauty by exciting love and admiration.</p>
            <p>The company at Bareges ſoon became acquainted with each other, and the ladies always took notice of Madelaine when they met her in their walks, which however, did not happen very often, for her father was frequently unable to go out. When he did he was ſupported on one ſide by Madelaine, and on the other by his ſervant. It was impoſſible to ſee with inſenſibility, the attention which this intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing young woman paid her father, whom ſhe never quitted one moment. It was remarked with what careful tenderneſs ſhe uſed to lead him along the ſtreets of Bareges, walking the ſloweſt pace ſhe could, and watching his ſteps as he moved feebly on. And when he was not able to venture out, ſhe was ſeen at the window of their little parlour reading, in order to entertain him.—Her looks and manner announced that her diſpoſition was naturally ſprightly, and that ſhe would have been gay, if her father had not been ſick. But all the cheerfulneſs ſhe could aſſume while he ſuffered, was exerted to amuſe him, and ſhorten the tedious hours of languor and debility.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="202" facs="unknown:035098_0200_1000A475AB28E3A0"/>
Though Madelaine was handſome, the obſcurity and ſecluſion in which ſhe lived preſerved her from the envy of the women.—They knew well enough, that the gentlemen at Bareges were, for the moſt part, men of the world, who though they may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire beauty, and approve of virtue, are never ſo far the dupes of any tender or moral ſentiment as to let it interfere either with their vanity, their ambition, or their intereſt. Although the French revolution had not yet happened, theſe ladies were aware that with reſpect to marriage, the age of <hi>calculators</hi> was already come, and therefore no rival was to be feared in Madelaine. The ladies joined with the men in admiting the grace of her perſon, and amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble qualities which her conduct diſplayed. Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine, in ſhort, became the object of general eſteem.</p>
            <p>Auguſte, for ſo I ſhall call our young Pariſian, who has loſt his title ſince the laws of equality have been eſtabliſhed in his country—Auguſte ſpoke leſs of Madelaine than the other gentlemen at Bareges; but it was perhaps becauſe he thought of her more. Sometimes in his ſolitary morning rambles he uſed to make compariſons between her and the Pariſian ladies, among whom he had paſſed the winter, and the compariſon generally ended with a deep
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:035098_0201_1000A48B5DAD0FA8"/>
ſigh. The ſcene on theſe meditations was certainly much in Madelaine's favour. Perhaps at Paris or Varſailles, Auguſte might have been dazzled by the poliſhed graces of a fine lady rouged, powder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, perfumed and equipped for conqueſt. Theſe artificial attractions might, perhaps, have accorded well enough with clipped trees and angular walks. But Madelaine's ſimple manners, Madelaine's na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſmiles, and unſtudied bluſhes, were far more in uniſon with the Pyrennean mountains.</p>
            <p>One evening when Auguſte was walking in the town of Bareges with ſome ladies, he ſaw Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine at a little diſtance aſſiſting, with great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to ſupport her father, who appeared to be ſeized with a fit. Auguſte darted like an arrow toward the ſpot, and held up the officer till he found himſelf ſomewhat recovered; and then Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſte, with a ſort of gentle violence, obliged Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine, who was pale and trembling, to let go her father's arm, and ſuffer him to aſſiſt the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant in leading him home, which was but a few ſteps farther. Auguſte entered the houſe, where he remained till the old officer was a little revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;—and, after prevailing upon Madelaine to take a few hartſhorn drops, he retired.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="204" facs="unknown:035098_0202_1000A547A28065C0"/>
The next morning he felt that common civility required he ſhould pay the old officer a viſit and learn how he had paſſed the night. It happened that Madelaine had the very ſame idea. "Surely," thought ſhe, "it will be very ſtrange if this young man, who was ſo kind, ſo careful of my father, and who made me take ſome hartſhorn drops, ſhould neglect to call and enquire after us." This idea had come acroſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> her mind ſeveral times; and ſhe was meditating upon it at her father's bedſide, when Auguſte was announced.</p>
            <p>The old officer, who had all the finiſhed polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his country and his profeſſion, received him in the moſt courteous manner; and though he ſpoke with ſome difficulty, yet he was profuſe in acknowledgments for the ſervice Auguſte had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him. Madelaine's thanks were few, and ſimply expreſſed; but the tone in which they were uttered was ſuch that Auguſte felt he could have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed his life to have deſerved them.</p>
            <p>The old officer ſtill continued ſick, and therefore Auguſte ſtill conſidered it as an indiſpenſable mark of attention to go every day, and learn the ſtate of his health.—He alſo began to feel that theſe viſits became every day more neceſſary to
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:035098_0203_1000A47E852F6868"/>
his own happineſs. That happineſs was indeed embittered by many painful reflections. He well knew that to obtain his father the count de—'s conſent to marry Madelaine, was as impoſſible as it was for himſelf to conquer the paſſion ſhe had inſpired. He knew exactly the order in which his father's enquiries would run on this ſubject. He was aware that there were two interrogatories to be anſwered. The firſt was—"How many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>res has ſhe a year?" And the ſecond—"Is ſhe noble?" And nothing could be more embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſing than that the enquiry concerning fortune, would, he was ſure, come firſt; ſince that was the only article which could not be anſwered in a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory manner; for to Madelaine's family no objection could have been made. By the way, though the former nobility of France would not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely contaminate the pure ſtreams of noble blood by an union with the daughter of a <hi>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>turier,</hi> they had always ſufficient generoſity to abate ſome ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations of nobility in favour of a proper equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in wealth.</p>
            <p>Auguſte, while he was convinced of the impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of obtaining his father's conſent to his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, did not pay Madelaine one viſit the leſs
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:035098_0204_1000B693A5CE3130"/>
from that conſideration; and when the uſual hour of his viſit arrived, he often ſuddenly broke a chain of admirable reaſon on the imprudence of his attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in order to haſten to the dwelling of her he loved. In a ſhort time he ceaſed all kind of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the ſubject, and abandoned his heart without reſerve to the moſt violent and unconquerable paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>Auguſte made a declaration to the old officer of the ſentiments which his daughter had inſpired. The old gentleman mentioned it to Madelaine, and ſhe only anſwered by tears, of which he perfectly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the meaning. When Auguſte explained his ſituation with reſpect to his father, the officer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him to think of his daughter no more. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſte felt that he might as well have deſired him to ceaſe to breathe. He continued his viſits, and the officer was ſoon reduced to that ſtate of langour and debility which left him neither the power nor the wiſh to forbid them. His complaints increaſed every day, and were attended with many alarming ſymptoms. The ſeaſon for the water of Bareges was now paſt, and all the company left the place except the old officer, who was too weak to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and Auguſte, who, while Madelaine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained,
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:035098_0205_1000B6952EC0D388"/>
had no power to tear himſelf from the ſpot. In a few weeks the old officer felt that his dying hour was near. Auguſte knelt with Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine at his bedſide—her voice was ſuffocated by tears: and Auguſte had ſcarcely power to articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late in broken accents that he would devote his life to the happineſs of Madelaine. The old officer fixed his eyes with a look of tender anxiety upon his daughter, and ſoon after expired. Madelaine mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for her father with uncontrouled affliction, nor could all the attentions of her lover diſpel that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh with which her affectionate heart lamented the loſs of her parent.</p>
            <p>The winter being far advanced, ſhe propoſed to defer her journey to the diſtant province where ſhe and her father had lived, until ſpring, and to place herſelf in the mean time in a convent not far from Bareges. Auguſte exerted all the eloquence of love to induce her to conſent immediately to a private marriage. She heſitated at this propoſal; and while they were converſing together on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, the door of the room in which they were ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting was ſuddenly thrown open, and Auguſte ſaw his father the count de—enter. He had heard of the attachment which detained his ſon at Bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:035098_0206_1000B69799CF0E40"/>
and had haſtened to tear him from the ſpot before it was too late. He upbraided his ſon with great bitterneſs, and began alſo to upbraid Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine: but there was ſomething in her looks, her ſilence, and her tears, which ſtifled the terms of haughty reproach in which he was prepared to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs her; and ordering his ſon to leave the room, he deſired to ſpeak to her alone. After explaining to her the abſolute impoſſibility of her being ever united to his ſon, and his determination to diſinher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it him, and leave his whole fortune to his ſecond ſon, if Auguſte ſhould perſiſt in his attachment to her—after endeavouring to awaken her pride and her generoſity, he deſired to know where ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed going. She told him her intention of plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herſelf immediately in the convent of—. He approved of this deſign, and left her to go to his ſon. No ſooner was the door of the room ſhut, than Madelaine gave way to thoſe tears which ſhe had ſcarcely been able to refrain while the count was ſpeaking. She had never felt ſo ſenſibly her orphan condition as at this moment; and the dear remembrance of her fond father was mingled with the agony of diſappointed love.</p>
            <p>Meantime the count de—declared to his ſon,
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:035098_0207_1000B69A1B552588"/>
that his only chance of ever obtaining his miſtreſs, depended on his abſolute un-conditional ſubmiſſion to his commands, and that he muſt inſtantly attend him to Paris. Auguſte eagerly enquired what was to become of Madelaine, and his father told him that ſhe had determined to take refuge in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of—. Auguſte abſolutely refuſed to depart till he was allowed an interview with Madelaine. The count was obliged to conſent; but before he ſuffered them to meet, he obtained a promiſe from Madelaine not to mention to her lover any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of the converſation which had paſſed between her and the count.</p>
            <p>Auguſte, in this laſt interview with Madelaine, atoned for the cruel diſdain of his father, by the moſt ſolemn and paſſionate aſſurances of fidelity, not to be ſhaken by time or circumſtance; and then, after attempting to leave the room ſeveral times, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning as often, he at length tore himſelf away. Madelaine when ſhe ſaw him depart, felt that every earthly hope had vaniſhed with him.</p>
            <p>She ſet out early the next morning for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of—; but not till after ſhe had ſat for ſome time weeping in the chair which Auguſte uſed to
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:035098_0208_1000B69B9F0D5F10"/>
occupy. Madelaine paſſed the remaining part of the winter in the convent of—, during which pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod ſhe received frequent letters from Auguſte; and when ſpring arrived, he conjured her, inſtead of removing to her own province, to remain a little longer in her preſent ſituation; and flattered her with hopes of being able, ere long, to fulfil thoſe engagements upon which all his happineſs depended.</p>
            <p>In the ſummer of this year an event took place which will render that ſummer forever memorable. The French nation, too enlightened to bear any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger thoſe monſtrous oppreſſions which ignorance of its juſt rights alone had tolerated; ſhook off its fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and the revolution was accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>Madelaine was a firm friend to the revolution, which ſhe was told had made every Frenchman free, "And if every Frenchman is free," tho't Madelaine, ſurely every Frenchman may marry the woman he loves." It appeared to Madelaine, that, putting all political con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, points upon which ſhe had not much medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, out of the queſtion, obtaining liberty of choice in marriage was alone well worth the trouble of a revolution; and ſhe was as warm a patriot from this ſingle idea, as if ſhe had ſtudied the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of rights made by the conſtituent aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, in all its extent and conſequences.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="211" facs="unknown:035098_0209_1000A47143F42178"/>
The count de—, who was informed of the correſpondence between the two lovers, and who ſaw little hopes of his ſon's ſubduing a paſſion which this intercourſe of letters ſerved to cheriſh, contriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed means to have Auguſte's letters intercepted at the convent. In vain Madelaine enquired with all the anxiety of tenderneſs for letters. In vain ſhe count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the hours till the return of the poſt days. Poſt after poſt arrived, and brought no tidings of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſte. Three months paſſed in the cruel torments of anxiety and ſuſpenſe, and were at length ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by deſpair. Madelaine believed ſhe was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten—forgotten by Auguſte! She conſulted her own heart, and it ſeemed to her impoſſible; yet, after a ſilence of three months, ſhe could doubt no longer.</p>
            <p>Poor Madelaine now recollected with anguiſh, inſtead of pleaſure, that all Frenchmen were free. She would have found ſome ſad conſolation in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that all Frenchmen were ſlaves. It would have been ſome alleviation of her ſorrows if Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſte had been forced to abandon her; and ſhe fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied ſhe could have borne to loſe him, if ſhe had been ſure that he ſtill loved her—it was loſing him by his own fault that filled her heart with pangs almoſt inſupportable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="212" facs="unknown:035098_0210_1000B69D47A01E30"/>
The little pittance which Madelaine, after paying her father's debts, had left for her own ſupport, was inſufficient to defray her expences as a boarder in the convent. She had already by her ſweetneſs and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs, gained the affections of ſome of the nuns, to whom ſhe was alſo attached, and who inceſſantly conjured her to take the veil. "And why," ſhe ſometimes exclaimed, "why ſhould I heſitate any longer in ſo doing? Since Auguſte is loſt, what have I to regret in renouncing the world? What ſacrifice do I make; what happineſs do I reſign?</p>
            <p>Madelaine had no ties to the world, of which ſhe knew but little: but to ſeparate herſelf irrecovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and for ever, from him to whom her ſoul was devoted—to ſee him, to hear his voice no more—to take vows which would make it even a crime to think of him—to baniſh him even from her thoughts—alas! Madelaine felt like Eloiſa.
<q>
                  <l>"All is not heaven's while Abelard has part,</l>
                  <l>"Still rebel nature holds out half my heart!"</l>
               </q>
Sometimes too the idea occurred that Auguſte might love her ſtill—"And am I then," thought Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine, "going to reduce myſelf to a ſtate in which I ſhall be forced to wiſh he was unfaithful, in order to ſave me from the agonies of remorſe!"—She
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:035098_0211_1000B6A0042854C0"/>
put off all thoughts of entering on her novitiate for ſome weeks longer—no letters arrived, and again her reſolution to take the veil returned. "Why," cried ſhe, "why ſhould I ſtill continue to lament that inconſtant lover who thinks of me no more? Alas, did he not ſee the anguiſh of my ſoul at part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him?—Does he not know the deſerted ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation in which I am left?—Oh, yes! he knows I have no other refuge, no other reſource than taking the veil—no doubt he wiſhes to hear I have done ſo—he will find in my renunciation of the world ſome excuſe for his infidelity—Oh, heavens! will Auguſte hear then that I am ſeparated from him for ever without one ſigh?—Ah, why need I deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate any longer?—My trials will ſoon be paſt—I feel that my heart will break—yes, death will come to my relief—and in heaven I ſhall find my father!"</p>
            <p>Madelaine at length determined to join the holy ſiſterhood of the convent. The white veil for her novitiate was prepared. The day was fixed, when, proſtrate with her face toward the earth, and with flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſcattered over her, and a part of her long treſſes cut off, ſhe was to enter upon that ſolemn tribunal preparatory to her eternal renunciation of the world—of Auguſte!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="214" facs="unknown:035098_0212_1000B6A1894FD9A0"/>
A few days before that which was appointed for the ceremony, Madelaine was called to the parlour, where ſhe found her lover, with ſome of the munici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal officers of the town, wearing their national ſcar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s.</p>
            <p>Madelaine, at the ſight of Auguſte, with difficulty reached a chair, in which ſhe ſellback ſenſeleſs; while Auguſte could not forbear uttering ſome imprecati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt the iron grate by which they were ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and which prevented him from flying to her aſſiſtance. He, however, procured help, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delaine recovered.</p>
            <p>One of the municipal officers then informed her, that they had received the day before a decree of the national aſſembly, forbidding any nuns to be profeſſed. He added, that the municipality had already given information of this new law to the abbeſs, who had conſented to allow Madelaine to leave the convent immediately. As he pronounced theſe laſt words, Madelaine looked at her lover.—Auguſte haſtened to explain to her that his uncle, who loved him, and pitied his ſufferings, had at length, made a will, leaving him his fortune upon condition that his father conſented to his marriage with Madelaine.</p>
            <p>When her lover and the municipal officers departed, Madelaine retired to her apartment, to give way to
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:035098_0213_1000A48632708578"/>
thoſe delicious tears which were poured from a heart overflowing with wonder, thankfulneſs, and joy. When her firſt emotions had ſubſided, ſhe began to pack up her little wardrobe in preparation for leaving the convent on the following day. "I always loved the revolution," thought Madelaine, as ſhe laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the white gown in which ſhe was to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the next morning; "and this laſt decree is ſurely of all others the beſt and wiſeſt—but if it had come too late!"—At this idea Madelaine took up the veil for her novitiate, which lay upon her table, and bathed it with a flood of tears.</p>
            <p>The next morning, Auguſte and Madelaine were married in the pariſh church of—, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after the ceremony, ſet out for Paris, where they now live, and are, I am told two of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt people, and the beſt patriots in France.</p>
