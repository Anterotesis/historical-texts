      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>In aſcertaining and defining the powers of congreſs, the convention evidently purſued this obvious principle, that all
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:021131_0011_0FB248E8DEDD1B98"/>
things, which concern the union in general, ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated by the federal head; and that each ſtate legiſlature ſhould regulate thoſe things, which concern only its own internal government, together with the ſeparate intereſts of its citizens. The enemies of the propoſed conſtitution have deemed it material to ſhew, that ſuch a one never exiſted before. It does not indeed agree with definitions in books, taken from the Amphyctionic council, the United Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, or the Helvetic body. They would therefore infer, that it is wrong. This mode of reaſoning deſerves not a ſerious refutation. The convention examined thoſe ſeveral conſtitutions, if ſuch they can be called. It found them either woefully defective, as do their own particulars, object, or inapplicable to ours. Peradventure, our own article <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>It is univerſally, by good writers, agreed, that where any one political body poſſeſſes <hi>full</hi> powers, legiſlative and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive, whether it be a ſingle man, or a ſelect ſay, or a numerous aſſembly, it matters not;—the government muſt, in a ſhort time, become deſpotic.

of rights. This hackneyed principle has been urged, with great confidence, againſt conſtituting the ſenate a council to the preſident. It has been urged too, even by the men who would have the whole powers of the federal gevernment centered in a ſingle aſſembly. I mean the men who inſiſt that the convention ought to have done no more than adviſe in what manner the powers of the preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs ſhould be increaſed. Let us underſtand the principle in its proper extent. It does not follow, that a body, whoſe aſſent is required in making laws, but who cannot, by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, do any legiſlative act, may not be a fit council to the ſupreme executive magiſtrate, deriving his authority, like them from the people, in no manner dependent on them, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The objection to this part of the conſtitution, I confeſs, at firſt, appeared formidable. The reaſons which I now conjecture to have influenced the convention, did not then occur. But I have long adhered to a maxim, which I warmly recommend to others—never to condemn, abſolutely, even within myſelf, any one kind, until I can hit upon ſome other kind which I <hi>conceive</hi> better. As no human inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution can poſſeſs abſolute perfection, it is an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But this faculty of finding faults is by no means ſufficient to conſtitute the politician or ſtateſman. I delib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>One reaſon, and that not very unpopular, is the great additional expence. However, this reaſon I deem the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of all; and the general propoſition involves a great varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of other conſiderations.—</p>
            <p>It is eſſential to a council, that the members be free, as poſſible, from all bias, or improper influence. This ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and diſtinct council muſt be elected by the people, or
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:021131_0013_0FB248EB6B4C9070"/>
by ſpecial electors; by the legiſlature, or by one of its branches; or by ſome other department; or by the preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.—</p>
            <p>That the people ſhould either make laws to bind them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or elect perſons, without whoſe conſent, no laws ſhall be made, is eſſential to their freedom. But univerſal experience forbids, that they ſhould alſo immediately chooſe perſons for the execution of the laws. Shall the legiſlature then, or the ſenate, or the houſe of repreſentatives, have this appointment? A council thus choſen would be depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on its electors; and is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> be the ſame thing, in many reſpects, as if the legiſlature ſhould execute its own laws. Can you believe, that a council, choſen actually, or once in two or three years, would dare to purſue, in all caſes the dictates of its own judgment, contrary to the known will of thoſe, who will ſoon have an opportunity <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> removing them? Would they not be emulous to pleaſe leading men; and would there not be opened, at every pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of election, a fine field for intrigue and cabal? There would be one way only of rendering a council, thus choſen, independent of their electors; and that is, the chooſing them for life, with ſalaries, not to be augmented or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</p>
            <p>Againſt chooſing an executive for life the reaſons are weighty indeed. Should they then hold their commiſſions during good behaviour, there muſt be ſome tribunal to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine on that good behaviour; and what body it can be, except the congreſs, would be difficult to decide. Beſides <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> behaviour in a member of council is not determinable, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> that of a judge, which has relation to the laws, and things univerſally known. In the office of the former, there is ſo much leſt to diſcretion, that I cannot perceive with what propriety he can hold it on the condition of good behaviour. There can be no ſure criterion, and the deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion muſt therefore unavoidably depend on the diſcretion, or mere opinion, of his judges, founded on no eſtabliſhed principles whatever.—</p>
            <p>A council, choſen by the preſident himſelf would proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conſiſt of creatures devoted to his will. I can diſcern no reaſon, wherefore any other officers of the government
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:021131_0014_0FB248F326E0C628"/>
ſhould make the appointment. There remains then only the people's chooſing electors, and placing the council of the preſident on the ſame footing with himſelf. Here occurs the objection of expence; and here again would ariſe the controverſy reſpecting equality of repreſentation.—</p>
            <p>The ſenate will, in all human likelihood, conſiſt of the moſt important characters, men of enlightened minds, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in judgment, independent in their circumſtances, and not deriving their principal ſubſiſtence from their pay, as probably would the members of a board, diſtinct and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from all other public employments.—</p>

               </gap> is perhaps equal partiality; and electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are conducted by intrigue and cabal. A ſelect aſſembly is not ſo open to direct application; and although each may be ſuppoſed to entertain his partialities, he cannot recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend his favourites, without pointing out their eſſential qualifications, and becoming, in ſome meaſure, reſponſible for their conduct. It is here, that characters are moſt fairly

            <p>Before this appointment can be <hi>entailed,</hi> and before even the term can be enlarged, the conſtitution muſt be changed, by conſent of the people. By what method, then, ſhall the preſident effect this alteration? Every citizen in the union will be a cenſor on his conduct. Not even his perſon is particularly protected; and the means of oppreſſion are lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in his power.

An elective monarchy has long been ſeverely reprobated. But had the countries, where it prevailed, enjoyed regulations like theſe, they would perhaps, at this time, be preferred to the rules of hereditary ſucceſſion, which have ſo often placed fools and tyrants on the throne.</p>
            <p>It ſeems, however, that the preſident may poſſibly be continued for life. He may ſo, provided he deſerve it. If

            <p>I return to the powers of congreſs. They are almoſt univerſally admitted to be proper for a federal head, except only the <hi>ſweeping clauſe,</hi> and the power of raiſing fleets and armies, without any ſtint or limitation, in time of peace. The clauſe ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p>It is apprehended, that this <hi>ſweeping clauſe</hi> will afford pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, for freeing congreſs from all conſtitutional reſtraints.</p>
            <p>I will not here again inſiſt on the pledge we enjoy, in the common intereſt, and ſure attachment of the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and ſenate; ſetting aſide the little probability of a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority in each branch lying under the ſame temptation. Conſider the import of the words.</p>
            <p>I take the conſtruction of theſe words to be preciſely the ſame, as if the clauſe had proceeded further and ſaid, <q>No act of congreſs ſhall be valid, unleſs it have relation to the foregoing powers, and be neceſſary and proper for carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them into execution.</q> But ſay the objectors, <q>The congreſs, being itſelf to judge of the neceſſity and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, may paſs any act, which it may deem <hi>expedient</hi> for any other purpoſe.</q> This objection applies with equal force to each particular power, defined by the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; and, if there were a bill of rights, congreſs might be ſaid to be the judge of that alſo. They may reflect how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that every judge in the union, whether of federal or ſtate appointment, (and ſome perſons would ſay every jury) will have a right to reject any act, handed to him as a law which he may conceive repugnant to the conſtitution.</p>
            <p>It may nevertheleſs ſtrike you at firſt view, that a provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſo obviouſly apt to excite diſtruſt, might have wel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

been omitted. So indeed it might, were there a poſſibility of providing every thing, neceſſary and proper, for carrying into effect the various powers, intended to be conferred. Without this general clauſe, it were eaſy to ſuppoſe caſes, wherein a particular clauſe might be incompetent to its own purpoſe.—</p>
            <p>For want of ſome plain and obvious diſtinctions, there has been vented ſo much ſenſeleſs clamour againſt ſtanding armies, that they are become a political bugbear. A limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed monarch, with the means of maintaining, at all times, an army devoted to his will, might ſoon tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mple on the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and civil rights of his ſubjects. Could the preſent congreſs find means of augmenting the force, which it now maintains, which of you, on that account, would experience the ſlighteſt anxiety? Which of all the European powers is deſtitute of an army? Which of them, if they were free, could be ſecure of remaining ſo, without a ſtanding force? I might go further, and demand, whether any of them have loſt their liberties, by means of a <hi>ſtanding</hi> army? The troops, continually kept up in Great-Britain, are formidable to its neighbours, and yet no rational Engliſhman apprehends the deſtruction of his rights. It is true, that he knows, theſe troops cannot be maintained, without the conſent of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives, annually obtained. But the neceſſity of an army he readily conceives; and the number he leaves to the diſcretion of parliament. Ought then an American to have greater fears of a preſident, than an Engliſhman has of his king? Or may he not truſt his repreſentatives and the ſenate, with as much confidence, as the Engliſhman repoſes in the commons and lords?</p>
            <p>Let the federal head be conſtituted as it may, there can be no perfect ſecurity, without both a land force, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val armament. It is impoſſible to ſay how much will, at all times of peace, be ſufficient. We have the ſame ſecurity againſt the abuſe of this, as of any other authority. The expences of an army might indeed raiſe fears of a different kind,—that we ſhall not be able to maintain force enough for the moſt proper occaſion.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe a limitation in time of peace. What then is to be done on the proſpect of a war? Should you make the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:021131_0018_0FB248FB2783FF50"/>
diſtinction between profound peace, and a <hi>threatened</hi> war, who is there, but congreſs, to determine on the exigency? If you make no diſtinction, then will it be expedient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare war, at the inſtant in which the danger ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, in order that it may be lawful to prepare for only a juſt defence. In fine, I conſider this grand objection, as a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ere pretext for terrifying you, like children, with ſpectres <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nd hobgobblins. It may be material here to remark, that although a well regulated militia has ever been conſidered as the true defence of a free republic, there are always honeſt purpoſes, which are not to be anſwered by a militia. If they were, the burthen on the militia would be ſo great, that a free people would, by no means, be willing to ſuſtain it. If indeed it be poſſible in the nature of things, that congreſs ſhall, at any future period, alarm us by an improper augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of troops, could we not, in that caſe, depend on the militia, which is ourſelves. In ſuch a caſe it would be ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous to urge, that the federal government is inveſted with a power over the whole militia of the union. Even when congreſs ſhall exerciſe this power, on the moſt proper occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, it is provided in the conſtitution, that each ſtate ſhall officer, and train its own militia.—</p>
            <p>The objections againſt the judiciary are probably more ſincere. The article has been generally miſconceived, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>The judiciary power is to be veſted in one ſupreme court, fixed at the ſeat of government; and, for the advantage of government, with the eaſe and convenience of the people, the congreſs may hereafter appoint inferior courts in each of the ſtates. The juriſdiction of this ſupreme court is to be partly original, and partly appellate. With reſpect to the extent of either, there can be no poſſible doubt, as there is neither ambiguity nor uncertainty in the relative ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:021131_0019_0FB2490313A7EBE0"/>The original juriſdiction of the ſupreme court extends</p>

Caſes between a ſtate, and the citizens, or ſubjects, of a foreign ſtate.</p>
            <p>The appellate juriſdiction of the ſupreme court extends</p>
            <p n="1">1. To all caſes whatever between parties of every kind, in law and equity, ariſing under this conſtitution, and the laws of congreſs, paſſed agreeably thereto, and to treaties al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, or hereafter to be, made.</p>

            <p>One doubt ariſing on the judiciary article is, whether in theſe caſes of appellate juriſdiction, the appeal has both from the ſtate courts, and the inferior federal courts, or only from the former, or only from the latter.</p>
            <p>Another doubt is, whether the inferior federal courts are to be branches of the ſupreme court, conſtituted for conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, and having equal juriſdiction, both original and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellate, with the ſupreme court; or whether the inferior courts are to be confined to an <hi>original</hi> juriſdiction in thoſe caſes, wherein the ſupreme court has <hi>appellate</hi> juriſdiction.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not preſume to decide abſolutely on the genuine conſtruction of an article, which is ſaid to have cauſed much private debate and perplexity. I am however fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, that, as the article ſpeaks of an original and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellate juriſdiction, of a ſupreme court, and inferior courts; and, as there is no intimation of appeals from the ſeveral
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:021131_0020_0FB24905B5FCFBE0"/>
ſtate tribunals, the inferior federal courts are intended to have original juriſdiction in all caſes, wherein the ſupreme court has appellate juriſdiction; and the appeal lies only from them. I can, almoſt, with confidence, maintain, that, as there is no expreſs clauſe, or neceſſary implication, to ouſt the juriſdiction of ſtate courts, an action, after the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption of the plan, may be inſtituted in any court, having, at this time, a juriſdiction. And if an action be brought in a ſtate court, I do not, at preſent, perceive, that it can, in any manner, be transferred to the ſupreme or inferior federal court.</p>
            <p>According then to the beſt of my judgment the affair ſtands thus. The ſupreme federal court will have an exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive original juriſdiction in all caſes relative to the rights of ambaſſadors, other miniſters, and conſuls; becauſe, as I humbly conceive, the ſeveral ſtate governments have at this time nothing to do with theſe caſes. With reſpect to the caſes, in which a ſtate may be party, the ſupreme federal court, and the ſeveral ſtate courts, will have, I conceive, concurrent original juriſdiction, <hi>provided a ſtate may, at this time, inſtitute an action in its own name, in the courts of another ſtate.</hi> The inferior federal courts, and the ſtate courts, will, I conceive, have concurrent original juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in all the enumerated caſes, wherein all appeal lies to the ſupreme court, <hi>except only the caſes created by or under the propoſed conſtitution, in which, as they do not now exiſt, the inferior federal courts will have excluſive juriſdiction.</hi> From the ſtate inferior courts, I further apprehend, that an appeal will lie, in all caſes, to their own high courts of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, as heretofore.</p>
            <p>A choice of juriſdictions has been ever eſteemed a valuable right, even where there are both of the ſame kind. The purpoſe of extending ſo far the juriſdiction of the federal ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciary, is to give every aſſurance to the general govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of a faithful execution of its laws, and to give citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, ſtates, and foreigners, an aſſurance of the impartial ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of juſtice. Without this ſalutary inſtitution, the federal government might frequently be obſtructed, and its ſervants want protection. It is calculated not as an engine of oppreſſion, but to ſecure the bleſſings of peace and good
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:021131_0021_0FB2490728A33A90"/>
order. The proviſions reſpecting different ſtates, their citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, and foreigners, if not abſolutely neceſſary, are much to be applauded. The human mind is ſo framed, that the ſlighteſt circumſtance may prevent the moſt upright and well known tribunal from giving complete ſatisfaction; and there may happen a variety of caſes, where the diſtruſt and ſuſpicion may not be altogether deſtitute of a juſt founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—</p>
            <p>On theſe principles, an appeal as to fact is no leſs proper, than the appeal from judges of law. A jury, whoſe legal qualifications are only property and ripe age, may more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably incur the imputation of weakneſs, partiality, or undue influence. But in regard to appeals, it is very material to remark, that congreſs is to make ſuch regulations and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, as upon mature deliberation, it ſhall think proper. And indeed, before ſuch regulations and exceptions ſhall be made, the manner of appeal will not be aſcertained. Is it then to be preſumed, that, in making regulations and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, this appellate juriſdiction ſhall be calculated as an engine of oppreſſion, or to ſerve only the purpoſes of vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and delay.—</p>
            <p>As the rod of Aaron once ſwallowed up the rods of the Egyptian <hi>magi,</hi> ſo alſo is it feared, that theſe federal courts will, at length, ſwallow up the ſtate tribunals. A miracle, in one caſe, is as neceſſary, as in the other.</p>
            <p>But let not the officers of ſtate courts be overmuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed! The cauſes, which, by poſſibility, may be<note n="*" place="bottom">

An adequate proviſion is made by the propoſed plan. That the United States will aſſuredly inſtitute actions againſt two of the ſtates, ſetting up claims equally wild and extenſive, may appear from the following ſtatement.</p>
                  <p>New-Hampſhire, Rhode-Iſland, New-Jerſey, Delaware and Maryland, have been always intereſted in making good the common claim; as they never laid any particular claim to the territory in queſtion.—</p>

                  <p>Connecticut, and New-York, have both made ceſſions, which congreſs has accepted. Theſe two are therefore become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted.</p>
                  <p>Pennſylvania, although very extenſive, has her limits aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. She likewiſe is intereſted.—</p>
                  <p>Virginia, having made a ceſſion to congreſs, has ſince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſhed a part of the reſerved lands, or at leaſt offered inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, to Kentucky.—</p>
                  <p>North-Carolina, having once made a ceſſion, thought proper, in the omnipotence of her diſtinct ſovereignty, to repeal the act. Will not the ceſſion be determined valid, and the repeal void?</p>
                  <p>South-Carolina alſo, <hi>it is ſaid,</hi> has ceded part of that terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, which lately ſhe diſputed with Geo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

                  <p>But Georgia, the weakeſt of all, lays claim to an immenſe tract of country. In this territory there are warlike and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent tribes of the <hi>aborigines,</hi> now carrying terror and deſolation towards the heart of the country occupied by the whites. It is expected, that this circumſtance, with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of the weak foundation of her claims, will diſpoſe Georgia to give up without a ſuit, and conſent to be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed within narrower limits, ſo ſoon as a proper tribunal ſhall have power to enter upon a rational inveſtigation.—</p>
                  <p>N. B. For the above ſtatement I am principally indebted to a member of the late continental convention, and who for a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable time, was a member of congreſs, a gentleman of eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed honour and accuracy.</p>

In the courſe of ten years, not one action, that I know of, in Maryland, has concerned either another ſtate, or an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, conſul, or other miniſter.

He ſeems not aware, that, even in England, the eſtabliſhed fictions of law are not of modern date. They were ingenious devices, to remedy defects in the common law, <hi>without the aid of parliament.</hi> The fundamental prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple however, with reſpect to their adoption, was, that they <hi>conſiſt with equity, and be requiſite for the advancement of juſtice.</hi> Now every man, who would eſtabliſh over his cauſe a juriſdiction in a federal court, muſt ſhew, that ſuch cauſe comes under the deſcription of the conſtitution. If he do not, there will be wanting that equity, which is the ſupport of legal fiction. But can any man ſeriouſly imagine, that fiction will be permitted, to give the judges a power of legiſlation, denied to congreſs itſelf? Wherefore ſhould the judges, holding their commiſſions during good behaviour, be guilty of ſuch groſs falſhood, perjury, and breach of truſt? Would there not be a general revolt againſt ſuch barefaced impudent innovations? Away then with your trumpery of fictions! Accuſe not the illuſtrious members of the conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of having in their contemplation ſuch ſophiſtry, petti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fogging and chicane! But another fear is, that whatever actions may be inſtituted in the federal courts will there ſeek an admiſſion, on account of a more ſpeedy deciſion. That man alone, "on whoſe brow ſhame is aſhamed to ſit," will avow his oppoſition to a more ſpeedy adminiſtration of juſtice.</p>
            <p>The inſtitution of the trial by jury has been ſanctified by the experience of ages. It has been recogniſed by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of every ſtate in the union. It is deemed the birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right of Americans; and it is imagined, that liberty cannot ſubſiſt without it. The propoſed plan expreſsly adopts it, for the deciſion of all criminal accuſations, except impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and is ſilent with reſpect to the determination of facts in civil cauſes.</p>
            <p>The inference, hence drawn by many, is not warranted by the premiſes. By recogniſing the jury trial in criminal caſes, the conſtitution effectually provides, that it ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail,

ſo long as the conſtitution itſelf ſhall remain unimpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and unchanged. But, from the great variety of civil caſes, ariſing under this plan of government, it would be unwiſe and impolitic to ſay ought about it, in regard to theſe. Is there not a great variety of caſes, in which this trial is taken away in each of the ſtates? Are there not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more caſes, where it is denied in England? For the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention to aſcertain in what caſes it ſhall prevail, and in what others it may be expedient to prefer other modes, was impracticable. On this ſubject, a future congreſs is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide; and I ſee no foundation under Heaven for the opinion, that congreſs will deſpiſe the known prejudices and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their countrymen. A very ingenious writer of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia has mentioned the objections without deigning to refute that, which he conceives to have originated "in ſheer malice."—</p>
            <p>I proceed to attack the whole body of anti-federaliſts in their ſtrong hold. The propoſed conſtitution contains no <hi>bill of rights.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider again the nature and intent of a federal republic. It conſiſts of an aſſemblage of diſtinct ſtates, each complete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly organized for the protection of its own citizens, and the whole conſolidated, by expreſs compact, under one head, for their general welfare and common defence.</p>
            <p>Should the compact authoriſe the ſovereign, or head, to do all things it may think neceſſary and proper, then is there no limitation to its authority; and the liberty of each citizen in the union has no other ſecurity, than the ſound policy, good faith, virtue, and perhaps proper intereſts, of the head.</p>
            <p>When the compact confers the aforeſaid general power, making nevertheleſs ſome ſpecial reſervations and exceptions, then is the citizen protected further, ſo far as theſe reſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and exceptions ſhall extend.</p>
            <p>But, when the compact aſcertains and defines the power delegated to the federal head, then cannot this government, without manifeſt uſurpation, exert any power not expreſsly, or by <hi>neceſſary</hi> implication, conferred by the compact.</p>
            <p>This doctrine is ſo obvious and plain, that I am amazed any good man ſhould deplore the omiſſion of a bill of rights.
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:021131_0025_0FB2491192481590"/>
When we were told, that the celebrated Mr. Wilſon had advanced this doctrine in effect, it was ſaid, Mr. Wilſon would not dare to ſpeak thus to a CONSTITUTIONA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIST. With talents inferior to that gentleman's, I will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the doctrine againſt any CONSTITUTIONALIST who will condeſcend to enter the liſts, and behave like a gentleman.—</p>
            <p>It is, however, the idea of another moſt reſpectable cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, that, as a bill of rights could do no harm, and might quiet the minds of many good people, the convention would have done well to indulge them.—With all due de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, I apprehend, that a bill of rights might not be this innocent quieting inſtrument. Had the convention entered on the work, they muſt have comprehended within it every thing, which the citizens of the United States claim as a natural or a civil right. An omiſſion of a ſingle article would have cauſed more diſcontent, than is either felt, or pretended, on the preſent occaſion. A multitude of articles might be the ſource of infinite controverſy, by claſhing with the powers intended to be given. To be full and certain, a bill of rights might have coſt the convention more time, than was expended on their other work. The very appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it might raiſe more clamour than its omiſſion,—I mean from thoſe, who ſtudy pretexts for condemning the whole fabric of the conſtitution.—<q>What! (might they ſay) did theſe exalted ſpirits imagine, that the natural rights of mankind depend on their gracious conceſſions. If indeed they poſſeſſed that tyrannic ſway, which the kings of England had once uſurped, we might humbly thank them for their <hi>magna charta,</hi> defective as it is. As that is not the caſe, we will not ſuffer it to be underſtood, that their <hi>new-fangled</hi> federal head ſhall domineer with the powers not excepted by their precious bill of rights. What! If the owner of 1000 acres of land thinks proper to ſell one half, is it neceſſary for him to take a releaſe from the vendee of the other half? Juſt as neceſſary is i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:021131_0026_0FB249126BD29508"/>The reſtraints laid on the ſtate legiſlatures will tend to ſecure domeſtic tranquillity, more than all the bills, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations, of rights, which human policy could deviſe. It is very juſtly aſſerted, that the plan contains an avowal of many rights. It provides, that no man ſhall ſuffer by ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſt facto laws, or bills of attainder. It declares, that gold and ſilver only ſhall be a tender for ſpecie debts; and that no law ſhall impair the obligation of a contract.</p>
            <p>I have here perhaps touched a ſtring, which ſecretly draws together many of the foes to the plan. Too long have we ſuſtained evils, reſulting from injudicious emiſſions of paper, and from the operation of tender laws. To bills of credit, as they are now falſely called, may we impute the entire loſs of confidence between men. Hence is it, that ſpecie has, in a great degree, ceaſed its proper office, and been confined to ſpeculations, baneful to the public, and enriching a few enterpriſing ſharp-ſighted men, at the expence not only of the ignorant, ſlothful, and needy, but of their country's beſt benefactors. Hence chiefly are the bankruptcies throughout America, and the diſreputable ruinous ſtate of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce. Hence is it principally, that America hath loſt its credit abroad, and American faith become a proverb. The convention plainly ſaw, that nothing ſhort of a renunciation of the right to emit bills of credit could produce that grand conſummation of policy, the RESTORATION of PUB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIC and PRIVATE FAITH.</p>
            <p>Were it poſſible for the nations abroad to ſuppoſe Great-Britain would emit bills on the terms whereon they have iſſued in America, how ſoon would the wide arch of that mighty em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire tumble into ruins? In no other country in the univerſe has prevailed the idea of ſupplying, by <hi>promiſſory notes,</hi> the want of coin, for commerce and taxes. In America, indeed, they have heretofore ſerved many valuable purpoſes. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

So long as Europe ſhall believe we regard not juſtice, gratitude and honour, ſo long will America la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour under the diſadvantages of an individual, who attempts to make good his way through the world with a blaſted re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. To the man, who ſhall ſay, <q>it is of no conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to conſult national honour," I only anſwer thus,— If thy ſoul be ſo narrow and depraved, as to believe this, it were a needleſs attempt to cure thee of thy error.</q>
            </p>
            <p>On this ſubject, there is no neceſſity for enlarging, to the people of my native ſtate; their conduct on a recent occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion having acquired them great and deſerved applauſe. Is it neceſſary to enlarge on the propriety of giving more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient powers to a federal head? At this moment, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs is little more than a name, without power to effect a ſingle thing, which is the object of a confederate republic. Reflect on the recent period, when, in a ſiſter ſtate, a numerous body of her frantic citizens appeared armed for the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a government, framed by the people. When that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy ſtate was devoted to the miſeries of a civil war, did congreſs even dare to interpoſe? Conſcious of its inability to protect, it could only await the reſult, in ſilence and in ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. It indeed ventured to <hi>make application</hi> to the ſtates for a ſmall body of troops, under the poor pretext of another, and a neceſſary, deſtination. But, notwithſtanding the univerſal contagion of the alarm, did the ſtates, on <hi>that</hi> oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, comply with the <hi>requiſition?</hi> Suppoſe even an inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by a foreign power,—in what manner could congreſs provide for its own defence? In the contemptible light, in which America has lately ſtood, is it reaſonable to expect ſhe will be ſuffered to remain long in peace? The diſtance between the two continents is the only circumſtance, on which we can rely. All Europe is now in ſuſpence; and the reſult of your deliberations will inſtruct her in the part ſhe ſhall act.</p>
            <p>With amazement, her nations contemplate a ſcene; of which the world is too young to furniſh a parallel. We aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled our ſages, patriots, and ſtateſmen, to conſult what mode of government is capable of producing the greateſt ſum
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:021131_0028_0FB2491B750E4A68"/>
of general good, with the leaſt mixture of general, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial evil. Not that each individual in this auguſt aſſembly was expected to offer a ſyſtem; but that the product of their joint wiſdom ſhould be referred to the ſeveral ſtates, to be adopted, or rejected, as the great body of the people ſhall determine on a free and full deliberation.</p>
            <p>As the occaſion was unparalleled, ſo alſo is the plan, which, after many months of painful inveſtigation, is ſubmitted, with an unanimity, alſo unparalleled.</p>
            <p>If there be any man, who approves the great outlines of the plan, and, at the ſame time, would reject it, becauſe he views ſome of the minute parts as imperfect, he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect, that, if the ſtates ſhall think as he does, an alteration may be hereafter effected, at leiſure. When the convention determined, that the whole ſhould be received, or the whole fail, they did it not on an arrogant conceit of their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibity, but on the ſoundeſt principles of policy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe. Were each ſtate legiſlature, or convention, to take it up, article by article, and ſection by ſection, with the liberty of adopting ſome, and rejecting the reſt, in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, ſo ſmall a part would be approved by nine ſtates, on the narrow view which each has of the ſubject, and attached as each is to its own ſuppoſed intereſt, that, in its mutilated condition, it would be worſe than the preſent confederation. For thirteen different aſſemblies, in that way, to approve ſo much of any plan whatever, as might merit the name of ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, the convention well knew to be impoſſible. Were there any one body of men, inveſted with full power, in behalf of the whole United States, to conſider, and amend the plan, then would it be proper to debate it by ſections, in the ſame manner as it was originally debated.</p>
            <p>With a view to defeat totally the plan, another general convention is propoſed; not with the power of giving a finiſhing hand to a conſtitution; but <hi>again</hi> to conſider ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, to ſtrike out, to add, and <hi>again</hi> to make their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to the ſeveral ſtates.</p>
            <p>In this way, there can never be an end. We muſt at laſt return to this,—that whatever is agreed on, by the aſſembly appointed to propoſe, muſt be either adopted in the whole, or in the whole rejected.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:021131_0029_0FB2491CEC1199D8"/>The idea of a new convention is ſtarted by ſome men, with the vain expectation of having amendments made to ſuit a particular ſtate, or to advance their own ſelfiſh views. Were this fatal idea adopted, I ſhould bid a laſt adieu to that elevated hope, which now inſpires me, of living under the happieſt form of government which the ſun ever beheld. Recollect again and again, that almoſt every ſtate in the union made a determined point of delegating its firſt charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to this grand convention. Reflect upon the time ſpent in the arduous work, and the ſacrifices which thoſe diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed perſons made to their country. Should the ſame men be deputed again, would they not, think you, with the ſame unanimity, ſubſcribe and recommend the ſame plan? So far as I have been informed, thoſe members, who, in the progreſſion of the plan, had oppoſed certain parts, and yet afterwards ſubſcribed cheerfully to the whole, have, with the candour which becomes them, acknowledged their errors in debate. Even an illuſtrious character, who was of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority, conſiſting only of three, I have been told, has ſince regretted his refuſal.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe then a ſecond convention, with a different choice of delegates. Theſe too would either ſpeedily ſubſcribe, or they might propoſe ſome other ſyſtem, to be debated, para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph by paragraph, in thirteen different aſſemblies; and then there would be the ſame probability of a mutilated plan; or they would propoſe ſomething, to be adopted or rejected in the whole; and there would be the ſame neceſſity of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther convention. Beſides, as the ſecond convention, if it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of different men, muſt <hi>inevitably</hi> be inferior to the firſt, there is little probability that their work will be ſuperior. Never again, in an aſſembly conſtituted as that was, will there be found the ſame liberality of ſentiment, "the ſame ſpirit of amity, and the ſame mutual deference and conceſſion."</p>
            <p>If it be contended, that the ſecond, being poſſeſſed of the various objections from the ſeveral ſtates, muſt be better able to determine, I would aſk, what conduct this ſecond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention ſhould adopt? Are they to take the propoſed plan, and ſtrike out every thing objected to by nine ſtates, or by ſeven ſtates, or by any one of the ſtates? Or may they like wiſe adopt and recommend the entire plan? In ſhort, to
<pb n="32"

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
appoint a ſecond convention, merely to conſult and propoſe, would be the moſt abſurd expedient, that ever, in a matter of this amazing magnitude, was propoſed. Does any man then entertain the thought of another kind of convention, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with full powers to conſult, amend, adopt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm? A ſcheme like this was never yet, I truſt, in agitation. But, if it were, I would propoſe this ſingle queſtion. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it better to amend, before it be tried, that plan, which may be termed the reſult of the wiſdom of America, or leave it to be amended, at leiſure, as mature experience ſhall direct?</p>
            <p>Although a very great variety of ſenſible objections have been publicly offered, the real and ſincere objections are hardly ever diſcloſed in private. There is a claſs, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the union of <hi>thirteen different ſtates,</hi> and the reaſon they aſſign, is the vaſt extent of our territory. Let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider well their objection.</p>
            <p>To conſolidate the whole thirteen ſtates into a ſingle or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganization, was out of the convention's contemplation,—for two unanſwerable reaſons. In the firſt place, they were ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, that not one of the ſtates would renounce its ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty. In the next place, they conſidered, that, in a ſingle government, with a great extent of territory, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages are moſt unequally diffuſed. As the extreme parts are ſcarcely ſenſible of its protection, ſo are they ſcarcely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der its domination. It is generally agreed, that a great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended nation can long continue under no <hi>ſingle</hi> form of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, except a deſpotiſm, into which, either a republic, or a limited monarchy, will be certain to degenerate. And hence, if I underſtand the man who ſtyles himſelf a <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel,</hi> he inſinuates, that, if theſe ſtates will perſiſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining under one head, they muſt ſoon fall under the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of a deſpot. But, my fellow-citizens, in a confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate republic, conſiſting of diſtinct ſtates, completely or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganized within themſelves, and each of no greater extent than is proper for a republican form, almoſt all the bleſſings of government are equally diffuſed. Its protection extends to the remoteſt corner, and there every man is under re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of laws.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:021131_0031_0FB249229BB1AD08"/>A true federal republic is always capable of acceſſion by the peaceable and friendly admiſſion of new ſingle ſtates. <hi>Its true ſize is neither greater nor leſs than that, which may comprehend all the ſtates, which, by their contiguity, may become enemies, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs united under one common head, capable of reconciling all their differences.</hi> Such a government as this, excels any ſingle go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, extending over the ſame territory, as a band of brothers is ſuperior to a band of ſlaves, or as thirteen common men, for the purpoſes of agriculture, would be ſuperior to a giant, enjoying ſtrength of body equal to them all.</p>
            <p>The idea of a balance has long influenced the politics of Europe. But how much ſuperior to this almoſt impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble balance would be a general league, conſtituting a kind of federal republic, conſiſting of all the independent powers in Europe, for preventing the impoſitions and encroachments of one upon another! A true and perfect confederate go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, however, in her ſituation, is not to be attained; although the great ſoul of HENRY THE FOURTH is ſaid to have conceived the idea.</p>
            <p>Shall America then form one grand federal republic? Or ſhall ſhe, after experiencing the benefits of even an imperfect union, and when a union the moſt perfect is requiſite for her permanent ſafety;—ſhall ſhe, in this ſituation, divide into thirteen contemptible ſingle governments, expoſed to every inſult and wrong from abroad, and watching each other's motions, with all the captiouſneſs of jealous rivals? Or ſhall ſhe divide into two or more federal republics, actuated by the ſame malignant diſpoſitions? In either of theſe caſes, after ſtruggling through infinite toils, difficulty, and danger, ſhould the thirteen ſingle ſtates be, at laſt, delivered from foreign foes, they will fall upon each other; and no man can predict, what forms of government, or diviſion of terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, ſhall finally obtain—. Two or three federal repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics might poſſibly retain their independence. But they would be in the ſame ſituation, with reſpect to each other, as France, England, and Spain, ſcarcely ever free from war; practiſing the arts of diſſimulation and intrigue; in vain ſtriving to impoſe, by endleſs negotiation; and, after all, relying only on the immenſe naval and land forces, which they continually maintain.</p>

            <p>With the proſpect of my country's future glory, preſented to my glowing imagination, it is difficult to reſiſt the ſtrong impulſe of enthuſiaſm.

To acquit themſelves, like men, when viſible danger aſſails; and, when it is repelled, to ſink like ſavages, into indolence, is ſaid to be the characteriſtic of Americans. I am not, however, one of thoſe, who imagine a neceſſity for embracing almoſt any ſcheme, which the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention might have deviſed, for giving to the union more efficient powers.

Let us be frugal, economical, induſtrious! Let us ſuſpend the cruel collection of debts! Let commerce continue to droop! Let us awhile ſubmit even to infamy; and turn a callous ear to the indignant reproaches of our late faithful and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate ſervants, friends and benefactors.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To this purpoſe might a man plauſibly declaim; provided the propoſed plan contained many and great faults; provided it were not calculated to promote the general good, without violating the <hi>juſt rights</hi> of a ſingle individual; and provided it were not the beſt, which, under all circumſtances, could be reaſonably expected. It was the parting declaration of
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:021131_0033_0FB249276B2E88F0"/>
the American NESTOR, to his exalted fellow-labourers, that <q>he would ſubſcribe, becauſe he thought it good, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did not know, but it was the beſt that could be contrived.</q> My own declaration, which would be the ſame, were I now ſtanding on the verge of eternity, is, that if the whole matter were left to my diſcretion, I would not change a ſingle part. On reflection, I was pleaſed with the conduct of the Virginia and Maryland aſſemblies, in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing diſtant days for the meeting of their ſtate conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Not that I greatly admired the ſuppoſed motive; but becauſe I ſincerely wiſhed every man might have time to comprehend and weigh the plan, before the ultimate deciſion of theſe two ſtates ſhould be pronounced. The longer it is contemplated, after it is underſtood, the greater, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, will be the approbation of thoſe, who wiſh the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic good, and to whoſe private views and expectations, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, which tends to promote that good, can be greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimental.—</p>
            <p>But alas! My fellow-citizens, on the adoption of this fatal plan, and when every part of the great complicated ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine ſhall be put in motion, the luſtre of our ſtate aſſemblies will be diminiſhed by the ſuperior ſplendour of the federal head. This ſingle conſideration, although many heſitate to avow it, will cauſe more oppoſition, than all the reſt united. Weigh well the objection. If ever it be material to inquire, by whom reaſons are adduced, it is on this peculiar occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. From the objection itſelf, may perhaps be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the danger we are expoſed to, from the ſecret views and ſelfiſh conſiderations of the objector.</p>

The avertion from ceding them to congreſs, is juſt as reaſonable as in a ſtate of nature would be the reluctance of an individual to relinquiſh any of his natural rights, upon entering into a ſtate of ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The principle, on which, at length, he ſurrenders, is the neceſſity of every one's making a ceſſion of ſome rights, to enable the ſovereign to protect the reſt. Each ſtate is fully ſenſible, that ſhe cannot protect herſelf; and yet ſhe would enjoy the advantages of an union, without making the neceſſary contributions. To diſcern how prepoſterous is the idea, requires not more than a moment's reflection.</p>
            <p>For the honour of my countrymen, I hope this extreme reluctance to ſurrender power is confined to thoſe, whoſe ambition, or private intereſt, would have all things ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the omnipotence of aſſembly. In the few years that the ſtate conſtitutions have endured, has not every one ſeen pregnant proofs of the vain love of domination? Has he not alſo ſeen deciſive marks of overbearing ſecret influence? Where are the inſtances of exalted patriotiſm?—But I forbear. Far from me is the wiſh to caſt wantonly one ſtinging or
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:021131_0035_0FB2492AB1141A28"/>
diſagreeable reflection. The ſubject naturally required the general remark, and I hope, this ſhort hint may be excuſed.—</p>
            <p>Is there a poſſible advantage to be derived to the public, from a ſingle ſtate's exerciſing powers proper only for the federal head; ſuppoſe even each ſtate ſhould uſe them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and alike; which, in the nature of things, is not to be expected? If there be men, who delight in parliamentary warfare; who chooſe a fair wide field for diſplaying their ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents; who wiſh to ſee every ſervant of the public proſtrate before them; whoſe ears are ſoothed by humble ſupplication; they may ſtill enjoy rich ſources of gratification. Are not the regulations of property, the regulations of the penal law, the protection of the weak, the promotion of uſeful arts, the whole internal government of their reſpective republics; are not theſe the main objects of every wiſe and honeſt legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? Are not theſe things ſtill in their power; and, whilſt free from invaſion or injuries abroad, are not theſe almoſt the only things, in which ſovereignty is exerciſed?</p>
            <p>That the ſtate legiſlatures will ſoon "drop out of ſight," is an idea moſt extravagant and abſurd; becauſe, in addition to the importance of their duties, the very exiſtence of the congreſs depends upon them. That they will, at leaſt, dwindle into ſomething like city corporations, is an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, founded on no better principle. May the Ruler of the univerſe inſpire them with wiſdom to diſcharge thoſe nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous and extenſive duties, which they will find remaining. To do this, as they ought, will be far proferable to the<note n="*" place="bottom">Is it poſſible to reflect, without indignation, on the fate of the five per cent. impoſt ſcheme?</note> breaking all uſeful national meaſures, and marring the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of a continent. To do this, as they ought, will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford more true pleaſure to a good mind, than the carrying, by conſummate eloquence and addreſs, the moſt intereſting federal meaſure, which can now be contrived by an enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened honeſt politician, in a ſtate aſſembly, poſſeſſing all its darling ſovereignties!</p>
            <p>You have been aſſured, that, ſoon as this fatal plan ſhall ſucceed, an hoſt of rapacious collectors will <hi>invade</hi> the land;
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:021131_0036_0FB2493169FD0DD0"/>
that they will wreſt from you the hard product of your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, turn out your children from their dwellings, perhaps commit your bodies to a jail; and your own immediate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives will have no power to relieve you.— This is the mere phrenzy of declamation, the ridiculous conjuration of ſpectres and hobgobblins!</p>
            <p>To the five per cent. impoſt moſt of the ſtates have more than once given their aſſent. This is the only tax which congreſs wiſhes immediately to impoſe. Of the impoſition of aſſeſſment, capitation, or direct taxes of any kind, the congreſs entertains no idea at preſent; and although it be proper for the federal head to poſſeſs this power in reſerve, nothing but ſome unforeſeen diſaſter will ever drive them to ſuch ineligible expedients. Setting aſide the immediate ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of revived credit and trade, and the increaſed va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of your property and labour, you will be delivered, in a great meaſure, from that load of direct taxation, which has been ſo unequally borne, and produced ſo little ſubſtantial good.</p>
            <p>Permit me to demand, what mighty benefit has reſulted from the exerciſe of thoſe ſovereign rights, that, in general, you ſhould be loth to reſign them? Has not a perpetual cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour been kept up (it matters not whether juſtly or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe) concerning the enormous impoſitions on the people? And what are the advantages derived to the people of the reſpective ſtates, to the union, or to meritorious individuals? Has not the far greater part of a ſtate's internal expences been owing to the extreme length of ſeſſions? Have not theſe ſeſſions been conſumed in diſguſting altercation, and in paſſing laws, ſerving to little better purpoſe, than to ſwell the ſtatute book, encourage a negligence of duty, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the adminiſtration of juſtice?</p>
            <p>To trace each real and oſtenſible objection up to its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſource, would be a taſk equally invidious, irkſome and unneceſſary. The characters of the principal advocates and opponents are well known. To him who declines not a public avowal of his ſentiments, ſome credit is due, for his candour; and he is entitled to your patient attention. But, he that prefers a ſecret corner, for dealing forth his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:021131_0037_0FB249354A046460"/>
and expoſitions, ſhould be heard with caution and diſtruſt. It is in a land of ſlavery alone, where truth ſhuns the open day—. Each ſide has imputed to the other illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral and ſelfiſh motives. Conſider then the particular inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of each; and bear this in your minds, that an intereſt may be either honourable and praiſe worthy, or directly the reverſe.</p>
            <p>You have been told, that the propoſed plan was calculated peculiarly for the rich. In all governments, not merely deſpotic, the wealthy muſt, in moſt things, find an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, from the poſſeſſion of that, which is too much the end and aim of all mankind. In the propoſed plan, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like a diſcrimination in their favour. How this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing objection is to be ſupported, I am at a loſs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture. Is it a juſt cauſe of reproach, that the conſtitution effectually ſecures property? Or would the objectors intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a general ſcramble? In eligibility to office, in ſuffrage, and in every other civil right, all men are on terms of perfect equality. And yet, notwithſtanding this juſt equality, each man is to pay taxes in proportion to his ability, or his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences.—</p>
            <p>A ſtill more ſurpriſing objection remains to be conſidered. <q>This new conſtitution, ſo much be praiſed and admired, will commence in a moderate ariſtocracy. To a corrupt and oppreſſive one the tranſition is eaſy, and inevitable, unleſs ſome Caeſar, or a Cromwell, in their ſtead, ſhall make a ſeizure of your liberties. As to the houſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives, they will either be inſignificant ſpectators of the conteſt between the preſident and the ſenate, or their weight will be thrown into one of the ſcales.</q>
            </p>
            <p>No man, indeed, has exactly uſed theſe words; but they contain the ſum and ſcope of ſeveral recent publications.</p>
            <p>In the courſe of my remarks, I have already ſaid enough to expoſe the futility of certain objections, which are uſhered to the world, under the auſpices of a pair of honourable names. Notwithſtanding the care and pompoſity, with which they are circulated, it is not worth while to draw an invidious compariſon. One gentleman, whoſe name is thus <hi>freely</hi> uſed, I think, calls the houſe of repreſentatives a mere
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:021131_0038_0FB2493669D27778"/>
ſhred, or rag of repreſentation. Does he conſider the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction between the objects of a confederate republic, and of a ſingle government? It is a poor return for that ſingular reſpect, which the convention paid to the majeſty of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in contriving, that congreſs ſhall not only be a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of ſtates, as heretofore, but alſo an immediate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of the people. Were 5, 10, or even 20,000, the ratio propoſed, then peradventure the honourable objector might clamour about the expence of a mobbiſh legiſlature. The fact is, that the new government, conſtructed on the broad baſis of equality, mutual benefits, and national good, is not calculated to ſecure a ſingle ſtate all her natural advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, at the expence of the natural and acquired advantages of her reſpectable brethren of New-England.—</p>
            <p>His real objection againſt conſtituting the ſenate an exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive council ariſes, I conceive, from the equality of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation. As to the trite maxim, that the legiſlative and executive ought ever to be diſtinct and ſeparate, I would, in addition to my foregoing obſervations on this head, refer him to Monteſquieu's chapter on the Engliſh government. I could wiſh, the writings of that great man, and of judge Blackſtone, ſo often either copied, or cited for concluſive authority, were better underſtood. Should a ſecond, or a third convention, be obtained, the aforeſaid honourable gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen can never be <hi>fully</hi> indulged in their main object of a proportionate repreſentation.</p>
            <p>The examples of a genuine ariſtocracy are rare. They were founded in times of profound ignorance, and when the maſs of property was in the hands of a few, whilſt the reſt pined in want and wretchedneſs. One European ariſtocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic government, if ſuch it can be called, has grown out of an original defective form, the offspring of neceſſity, and commenced amidſt the horrors of a civil war. Although the people of that country fought, and intended, to be free, their compact of government never was complete; they did not attend to the principle of rotation, and checks; and a genuine repreſentation did never there prevail.—</p>
            <p>An ariſtocracy can perhaps ſubſiſt only with a moderate extent of territory and population.—But it is a farce to talk of an ariſtocracy; when there are two branches, ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:021131_0039_0FB24939CBE2B1B0"/>
formed; when the members of each are choſen for a reaſonable term; and when their re-appointment depends on the good opinion of their countrymen. It is not in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that a man with the leaſt portion of <hi>common</hi> ſenſe can believe, the people of America will conſent to ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable change in their conſtitution, as ſhall confine all power to a few noble families, or that, without their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, the change will be effected, by internal policy, or force.</p>
            <p>Whilſt mankind ſhall believe freedom to be better than ſlavery; whilſt our lands ſhall be generally diſtributed, and not held by a few inſolent barons, on the debaſing terms of vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſallage; whilſt we ſhall teach our children to read and write; whilſt the liberty of the preſs, that grand palladium, which tyrants are compelled to reſpect, ſhall remain; whilſt a ſpark of public love ſhall animate even a ſmall part of the people; whilſt even ſelf-love ſhall be the general ruling principle; ſo long will it be impoſſible for an ariſtocracy to ariſe from the propoſed plan.—Should Heaven, in its wrath, inflict blindneſs on the people of America; ſhould they reject this fair offer of permanent ſafety and happineſs;—to predict, what ſpecies of government ſhall at laſt ſpring from diſorder, is beyond the ſhort reach of political foreſight.</p>
            <p>Believe me, my fellow-citizens, that no overweening ſelf-conceit, no vain ambition, no reſtleſs meddling ſpirit, has produced this addreſs. Long had I waited to ſee this vaſt queſtion treated, as it deſerves; and the publication diſſeminated in my native ſtate. Many judicious obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had appeared in news-papers and hand-bills. But no publication, that I have ſeen, has gone fully into the merits, conſidered the objections, and explained that, which is doubtful and obſcure. On this account I, at length, made the attempt. That my performance is equal to my wiſhes, I can by no means believe. I have, however, a conſolation in reflecting, that it will be difficult for any man to demonſtrate, that, in this buſineſs, I have a particular intereſt.—In many of my remarks, I have been anticipated by writings, which I have ſeen; and I have collected ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:021131_0040_0FB2493C93272320"/>
wherever I could find them. Could I be convinced, that I have ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d nothing, which had not before been ſaid or thought by thouſands, the reflection would yield far leſs mortification than pleaſure.</p>
