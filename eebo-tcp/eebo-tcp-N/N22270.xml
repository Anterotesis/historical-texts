            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A SICILIAN ROMANCE.</head>
            <p>ON the northern ſhore of Sicily are ſtill to be ſeen the magnificent remains of a caſtle, which formerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the noble houſe of Mazzini. It ſtands in the centre of a ſmall bay, and upon a gentle acclivity, which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on one ſide, ſlopes towards the ſea, and on the other riſes into an eminence crowned by dark woods. The ſituation i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> admirably beautiful and pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tureſque, and the ruins have an air of ancient grandeur<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which, contraſted with the preſent ſolitude of the ſcene, impreſſes the traveller with awe and curioſity. During my travels abroad I viſited this ſpot. As I walked over the looſe fragments of ſtone, which lay ſcattered through the immenſe area of the fabrick, and ſurveyed the ſublimity and grandeur of the ruins, I recurred, by a natural aſſociation of ideas, to the times when theſe walls ſtood proudly in their original ſplendour, when the halls were the ſcenes of hoſpital<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, and feſtive magnificence, and when they reſounded with the voices of thoſe whom death had long ſince ſwept from the earth. "Thus, ſaid I," ſhall the preſent generation—he who now ſinks in miſery—and he who now ſwims in pleaſure, alike paſs away and be forgotten." My heart ſwelled with the reflexion; and, as I returned from the ſcene with a ſigh, I fixed
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:029381_0003_0FE0D15318912388"/>
my eyes upon a friar, whoſe venerable figure, gently bending towards the earth, formed no unintereſting object in the picture. He obſerved my emotion; and, as my eye met his, ſhook his head and pointed to the ruin. "Theſe walls," ſaid he, "were once the ſeat of luxury and vice. They exhibited a ſingular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the retribution of Heaven, and were from that period forſaken, and abandoned to decay." His words excited my curioſity, and I inquired further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their meaning.</p>
            <p>"A ſolemn hiſtory belongs to this caſtle," ſaid he, "which is too long and intricate for me to relate. It is, however, contained in a manuſcript in our library, of which, I could, perhaps, procure you a ſight. A brother of our order, a deſcendant of the noble houſe of Mazzini, collected and recorded the moſt ſtriking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents relating to his family, and the hiſtory thus formed, he left as a legacy to our convent. If you pleaſe, we will walk thither."</p>
            <p>I accompanied him to the convent, and the friar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced me to his ſuperior, a man of an intelligent mind and benevolent heart, with whom I paſſed ſome hours in intereſting converſation. I believe my ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments pleaſed him; for by his indulgence, I was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to take abſtracts of the hiſtory before me, which, with ſome further particulars obtained in converſation with the abate, I have arranged in the following pages.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
               <p>TOWARDS the cloſe of the ſixteenth century, this caſtle was in the poſſeſſion of Ferdinand, fifth mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis of Mazzini, and was for ſome years the principal reſidence of his family. He was a man of a voluptuous and imperious character. To his firſt wife, he marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Louiſa Bernini, ſecond daughter of the count della Salario, a lady yet more diſtinguiſhed for the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her manners and the gentleneſs of her diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than for her beauty. She brought the marquis one ſon and two daughters, who loſt their amiable mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in early childhood. The arrogant and impetuous character of the marquis, operated powerfully upon the mild and ſuſceptible nature of his lady; and it was by many perſons believed, that his unkindneſs and neglect put a period to her life However this might be, he ſoon afterwards married Maria de Vellorno, a young lady eminently beautiful, but of a character very op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to that of her predeceſſor. She was a woman of infinite art, devoted to pleaſure and of an unconquera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpirit. The marquis, whoſe heart was dead to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal tenderneſs, and whoſe preſent lady was too vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile to attend to domeſtic concerns, committed the edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his daughters to the care of a lady, completely qualified for the undertaking, and who was diſtantly related to the late marchioneſs.</p>
               <p>He quitted Mazzini ſoon after his ſecond marriage, for the gaieties and ſplendour of Naples, whither his ſon accompanied him. Though naturally of a haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and overbearing diſpoſition, he was governed by his wife. His paſſions were vehement, and ſhe had the addreſs to bend them to her own purpoſe; and ſo well
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:029381_0005_0FE0D15D60BDE5A0"/>
to conceal her influence, that he thought himſelf moſt independent when he was moſt enſlaved. He paid an annual viſit to the caſtle of Mazzini; but the marchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneſs ſeldom attended him, and he ſtaid only to give ſuch general directions concerning the education of his daughters, as his pride, rather than his affection, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to dictate.</p>
               <p>Emilia, the elder, inherited much of her mother's diſpoſition. She had a mild and ſweet temper, united with a clear and comprehenſive mind. Her younger ſiſter, Julia, was of a more lively caſt. An extreme ſenſibility ſubjected her to frequent uneaſineſs; her temper was warm, but generous; ſhe was quickly ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritated and quickly appeaſed; and to a reproof, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever gentle, ſhe would often weep, but was never ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len. Her imagination was ardent, and her mind early exhibited ſymptoms of genius. It was the particular care of madame de Menoa to counteract thoſe traits in the diſpoſition of her young pupi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, which appeared inimical to their future happineſs; and for this taſk ſhe had abilities which entitled her to hope for ſucceſs. A ſeries of early misfortunes had entendered her heart, without weakening the powers of her underſtanding. In retirement ſhe had acquired tranquillity, and had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt loſt the conſciouſneſs of thoſe ſorrows which yet threw a ſoft and not unpleaſing ſhade over her charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. She loved her young charge with maternal fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and their gradual improvement and reſpectful tenderneſs repaid all her anxiety. Madame excelled in muſic and drawing. She had often forgot her ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows in theſe amuſements, when her mind was too much occupied to derive conſolation from books, and ſhe was aſſiduou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to impart to Emilia and Julia a power ſo valuable as that of beguiling the ſenſe of affliction. Emilia's taſte led her to drawing, and ſhe ſoon made
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:029381_0006_0FE0D1641EDF32C0"/>
rapid advances in that art. Julia was uncommonly ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible of the charms of harmony. She had feelings which trembled in uniſon to all its various and enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing powers.</p>
               <p>The inſtructions of madame ſhe caught with aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quickneſs, and in a ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rt time attained to a degree of excellence in her favourite ſtudy, which few perſons have ever exceeded. Her manner was entirely her own. It was not in the rapid intricacies of execution, that ſhe excelled ſo much, as in that delicacy of taſte, and in thoſe enchanting powers of expreſſion, which ſeem to breathe a ſoul through the ſound, and which make captive the heart of the hearer. The lute was her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite inſtrument, and its tender notes accorded well with the ſweet and melting tones of her voice.</p>
               <p>The caſtle of Mazzini was a large irregular fabrick, and ſeemed ſuited to receive a numerous train of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, ſuch as, in thoſe day<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, ſerved the nobility, either in the ſplendour of peace, or the turbulence of war. Its preſent family inhabited only a ſmall part of it; and even this part appeared forlorn and almoſt deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olate from the ſpaciouſneſs of the apartments, and the length of the galleries which led to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m. A melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly ſtillneſs reigned through the halls, and the ſilence of the courts, which were ſhaded by high turrets, was for many hours together undiſturbed by the ſound of any foot-ſtep. Julia, who diſcovered an early taſte for books, loved to retire in an evening to a ſmall cloſet in which ſhe had collected her favourite authors. This room formed the weſtern angle of the caſtle: one of its windows looked upon the ſea, beyond which was faintly ſeen, ſkirting the horizon, the dark rocky coaſt of Calabria; the other opened towards a part of the caſtle, and afforded a proſpect of the neighbouring woods. Her muſical inſtruments were here depoſited,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:029381_0007_0FE0D168B5B490D0"/>
with whatever aſſiſted her favourite amuſements. This ſpot, which was at once elegant, pleaſant, and retired, was embelliſhed with many little ornaments of her own invention, and with ſome drawings executed by her ſiſter. The cloſet was adjoining her chamber, and was ſeparated from the apartment of madame, only by a ſhort gallery. This gallery opened into another, long and winding, which led to the grand ſtaircaſe, termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating in the north hall, with which the chief apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the north ſide of the edifice communicated.</p>
               <p>Madame de Menon's apartment opened into both galleries. It was in one of theſe rooms that ſhe uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpent the mornings, occupied in the improvement of her young charge. The windows looked towards the ſea, and the room was light and pleaſant. It was their cuſtom to dine in one of the lower apartments, and at table they were always joined by a dependant of the marquis's, who had reſided many years in the caſtle, and who inſtructed the young ladies in the Latin tongue, and in geography. During the fine evenings of ſummer, this little party frequently ſupped in a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villion, which was built on an eminence in the woods belonging to the caſtle. From this ſpot the eye had an almoſt boundleſs range of ſea and land. It com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the ſtraits of Meſſina, with the oppoſite ſhores of Calabria, and a great extent of the wild and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ctur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſque ſcenery of Sicily. Mount Aetna, crowned with eternal ſnows, and ſhooting from among the clouds, formed a grand and ſublime picture in the back ground of the ſcene. The city of Palermo was alſo diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; and Julia, as ſhe gazed on its glittering ſpires, would endeavour in imagination to depicture its beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties while ſhe ſecretly ſighed for a view of that world, from which ſhe had hitherto been ſecluded by the mean jealouſy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="9" facs="unknown:029381_0008_0FE0D16F631EEBC8"/>
of rival beauty operated ſtrongly to the prejudice of Emilia and Julia. She employed all her influence over the marquis to detain them in retirement; and, though Emilia was now twenty, and her ſiſter eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, they had never paſſed the boundaries of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's domains.</p>
               <p>Vanity often produces unreaſonable alarm; but the marchioneſs had in this inſtance juſt grounds for appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion; the beauty of her lord's daughters has ſeldom been exceeded. The perſon of Emilia was finely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned. Her complexion was fair, her hair flaxen, and her dark blue eyes were full of ſweet expreſſion. Her manners were dignified and elegant, and in her air was a feminine ſoftneſs, a tender timidity, which ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtibly attracted the heart of the beholder. The figure of Julia was light and graceful—her ſtep was airy—her mien animated, and her ſmile enchanting. Her eyes were dark, and full of fire, but tempered with modeſt ſweetneſs. Her features were finely turned— every laughing grace played round her mouth, and her countenance quickly diſcovered all the various emotions of her ſoul. The dark auburn hair which curled in beautiful profuſion in her neck, gave a finiſhing charm to her appearance.</p>
               <p>Thus lovely, and thus veiled in obſcurity, were the daughters of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ble Mazzini. But they were hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, for they knew not enough of the world ſeriouſly to regret the want of its enjoyments, though Julia would ſometimes ſigh for the airy image which her fancies painted, and a painful curioſity would ariſe concerning the buſy ſcenes from which ſhe was excluded.

               <p>Converſation may be divided into two claſſes—the familiar and the ſentimental. It is the province of the familiar, to diſſuſe cheerfulneſs and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To render this ſort of converſation irreſiſtibly attractive, a knowledge of the world is requiſite, and that enchanting eaſe, that ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of manne, which is to be acquired only by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting the higher circles of poliſhed life. In ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timental converſation, ſubjects intereſting to the heart and to the imagination, are brought forward; they are diſcuſſed in a kind of ſportive way, with animation and refinement, and are never continued longer than politeneſs allows. Here fancy flouriſhes,—the ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities expand—and wit, guided by delicacy, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſhed by taſte—points to the heart.</p>

the evening of a very ſultry day, having ſupped in their favourite ſpot, the coolneſs of the hour, and the beauty of the night, tempted this happy party to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main there later than uſual. Returning home, they were ſurpriſed by the appearance of a light through the broken window-ſhutters of an apartment, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a diviſion of the caſtle which had for many years been ſhut up. They ſtopped to obſerve it, when it ſuddenly diſappeared and was ſeen no more. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame de Menon, diſturbed at this phenomenon, haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened into the caſtle, with a view of inquiring into the cauſe of it, when ſhe was met in the north hall by Vincent. She related to him what ſhe had ſeen, and ordered an immediate ſearch to be made for the keys of thoſe apartments. She apprehended that ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon had penetrated that part of the edifice with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of plunder; and, diſdaining a paltry fear where her duty was concerned, ſhe ſummoned the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the caſtle, with an in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ention of accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them thither. Vincent ſmiled at her apprehenſions, and imputed what ſhe had ſeen to an illuſion, which the ſolemnity of the hour had impreſſed upon her fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Madame, however, perſevered in her purpoſe; and, after a long and repeated ſearch, a maſſey key covered with ruſt was produced. She then proceeded to the ſouthern ſide of the edifice, accompanied by Vincent, and followed by the ſervants, who were agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated with impatient wonder. The key was applied to an iron gate, which opened into a court that ſeparated this diviſion from the other parts of the caſtle. They entered this court, which was overgrown with graſs and weeds, and aſcended ſome ſteps that led to a large door, which they vainly endeavoured to open. All the different keys of the caſtle were app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ied to the lock, without effect, and they were at length compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:029381_0011_0FE0D180E97A7C08"/>
to quit the place, without having either ſatisfied their curioſity, or quieted their fears. Every thing, however, was ſtill, and the light did not re-appear. Madame concealed her apprehenſions, and the family retired to reſt.</p>
               <p>This circumſtance dwelt on the mind of madame de Menon, and it was ſome time before ſhe ventured again to ſpend an evening in the pavillion. After ſeveral months paſſed, without further diſturbance or diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, another occurrence renewed the alarm. Julia had one night remained in her cloſet later than uſual. A favourite book had engaged her attention beyond the hour of cuſtomary repoſe, and every inhabitant of the caſtle, except herſelf, had long been loſt in ſleep. She was rouſed from her forgetfulneſs, by the ſound of the caſtle clock, which ſtruck one. Surpriſed at the late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the hour, ſhe roſe in haſte, and was moving to her chamber, when the beauty of the night attracted her to the window. She opened it; and obſerving a fine effect of moon-light upon the dark woods, leaned forwards. In that ſituation ſhe had not long remained, when ſhe perceived a light faintly flaſh through a caſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the uninhabited part of the caſtle. A ſudden tremor ſeized her, and ſhe with difficulty ſupported herſelf. In a few moments it diſappeared, and ſoon after a figure, bearing a lamp, proceeded from an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure door belonging to the ſouth tower; and ſtealing along the outſide of the caſtle walls, turned round the ſouthern angle, by which it was afterwards hid from the view. Aſtoniſhed and terrified at what ſhe had ſeen, ſhe hurried to the apartment of madame de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, and related the circumſtance. The ſervants were immediately rouſed, and the alarm became gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. Madame aroſe and deſcended into the north hall, where the domeſtics were already aſſembled. No one
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:029381_0012_0FE0D18830798BC0"/>
could be found of courage ſufficient to enter into the courts; and the orders of Madame were diſregarded, when oppoſed to the effects of ſuperſtitious terror. She perceived that Vincent was abſent, but as ſhe was ordering him to be called, he entered the hall. Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed to find the family thus aſſembled, he was told the occaſion. He immediately ordered a party of the ſervants to attend him round the caſtle walls; and with ſome reluctance, and more fear, they obeyed him. They all returned to the hall, without having witneſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any extraordinary appearance; but though their fears were not confirmed, they were by no means diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipated. The appearance of a light in a part of the caſtle which had for ſeveral years been ſhut up, and to which time and circumſtance had given an air of ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar deſolation, might reaſonably be ſuppoſed to excite a ſtrong degree of ſurpriſe and terror. In the minds of the vulgar, any ſpecies of the wonderful is received with avidity; and the ſervants did not heſitate in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the ſouthern diviſion of the caſtle to be inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by a ſupernatural power. Too much agitated to ſleep, they agreed to watch for the remainder of the night. For this purpoſe they arranged themſelves in the eaſt gallery, where they had a view of the ſouth tower from which the light had iſſued. The night, however, paſſed without any further diſturbance; and the morning dawn, which they beheld with inexpreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pleaſure, diſſipated for a while the glooms of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion. But the return of evening renewed the general fear, and for ſeveral ſucceſſive nights the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtics watched the ſouthern tower. Although no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing remarkable was ſeen, a report was ſoon raiſed, and believed, that the ſouthern ſide of the caſtle was haunted. Madame de Menon, whoſe mind was ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to the effects of ſuperſtition, was yet diſturbed
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:029381_0013_0FE0D18CD3F490F8"/>
and perplexed, and ſhe determined, if the light re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared, to inform the marquis of the circumſtance, and requeſt the keys of thoſe apartments.</p>
               <p>The marquis, immerſed in the diſſipations of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, ſeldom remembered the caſtle, or its inhabitants. His ſon, who had been educated under his immediate care, was the ſole object of his pride, as the marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was that of his affection. He loved her with ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic fondneſs, which ſhe repaid with ſeeming ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and ſecret perfidy. She allowed herſelf a free indulgence in the moſt licentious pleaſures, yet conducted herſelf with an art ſo exquiſite as to elude diſcovery, and even ſuſpicion. In her amours ſhe was equally inconſtant as ardent, till the young count Hippolitus de Vereza attracted her attention. The natural fickleneſs of her diſpoſition ſeemed then to ceaſe, and upon him ſhe centered all her deſires.</p>
               <p>The count Vereza loſt his father in early childhood. He was now of age, and had juſt entered upon the poſſeſſion of his eſtates. His perſon was graceful, yet manly; his mind accompliſhed, and his manners elegant; his countenance expreſſed a happy union of ſpirit, dignity, and benevolence, which formed the principal traits of his character. He had a ſublimity of thought, which taught him to deſpiſe the voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous vices of the Neapolitans, and led him to higher purſuits. He was the choſen and early friend of young Ferdinand, the ſon of the marquis, and was a frequent viſitor in the family. When the marchioneſs firſt ſaw him, ſhe treated him with great diſtinction, and at length made ſuch advances, as neither the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour nor the inclinations of the count permitted him to notice. He conducted himſelf towards her with frigid indifference, which ſerved only to inflame the paſſion it was meant to chill. The favours of the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:029381_0014_0FE0D19327F81610"/>
marchioneſs had hitherto been ſought with avidity, and accepted with rapture; and the repulſive inſenſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which ſhe now experienced, rouſed all her pride, and called into action every refinement of coquetry.</p>
               <p>It was about this period that Vincent was ſeized with a diſorder which increaſed ſo rapidly, as in a ſhort time to aſſume the moſt alarming appearance. Deſpairing of life, he deſired that a meſſenger might be diſpatched to inform the marquiſs of his ſituation, and to ſignify his earneſt wiſh to ſee him before he died. The progreſs of his diſorder defied every art of medicine, and his viſible diſtreſs of mind ſeemed to accelerate his ſate. Perceiving his laſt hour approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he requeſted to have a confeſſor. The confeſſor was ſhut up with him a conſiderable time, and he had already received extreme unction, when Madame de Menon was ſummoned to his bed ſide. The hand of death was now upon him, cold damps hung upon his brows, and he, with difficulty, raiſed his heavy eyes to Madame as ſhe entered the apartment. He beckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her towards him, and deſiring that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o perſon might be permitted to enter the room, was for a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſilent. His mind appeared to labour under op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive remembrances: he made ſeveral attempts to ſpeak, but either reſolution or ſtrength failed him. At length, giving Madame a look of unutterable anguiſh, "Alas madam," ſaid he, "Heaven grants not the prayer of ſuch a wretch as I am. I muſt expire long before the marquis can arrive. Since I ſhall ſee him no more, I would impart to you a ſecret which lies heavy at my heart, and which makes my laſt moments dreadful, as they are without hope." Be comforted," ſaid Madame, who was affected by the energy of his manner, "we are taught to believe that forgiveneſs is never denied to ſincere repentance." "You, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:029381_0015_0FE0D197CCF77928"/>
are ignorant of the enormity of my crime, and of the ſecret—the horrid ſecret which labours at my breaſt. My guilt is beyond remedy in this world, and I fear will be without pardon in the next; I therefore hope little from confeſſion even to a prieſt. Yet ſome good it is ſtill in my power to do; let me diſcloſe to you that ſecret which is ſo myſteriouſly connected with the ſouthern apartments of this caſtle". "What of them!" exclaimed Madame, with impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Vincent returned no anſwer; exhauſted by the effort of ſpeaking, he had fainted. Madame rung for aſſiſtance, and by proper applications, his ſenſes were recalled. He was however, entirely ſpeechleſs, and in this ſtate he remained till he expired, which was about an hour after he had converſed with Madame.</p>
               <p>The perplexity and aſtoniſhment of Madame, were by the late ſeene heightened to a very painful degree. She recollected the various particulars relative to the ſouthern diviſion of the caſtle, the many years it had ſtood uninhabited—the ſilence which had been obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed concerning it—the appearance of the light and the figure—the fruitleſs ſearch for the keys, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports ſo generally believed; and thus remembrance preſented her with a combination of circumſtances, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of myſtery enveloped that part of the caſtle, which it now ſeemed impoſſible ſhould ever be penetrated, ſince the only perſon who could have removed it, was no more.</p>
               <p>The marquis arrived on the day after that on which Vincent had expired. He came attended by ſervants only, and alighted at the gates of the caſtle with an air of impatience, and a countenance expreſſive of ſtrong emotion. Madame, with the young ladies, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him in the hall. He haſtily ſaluted his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:029381_0016_0FE0D19C8BA51828"/>
and paſſed on to the oak parlour, deſiring Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame to follow him. She obeyed, and the marquis inquired with great agitation after Vincent. When told of his death, he paced the room with hurried ſteps, and was for ſome time ſilent, at length ſeating himſelf, and ſurveying Madame with a ſcrutinizing eye, he aſked ſome queſtions concerning the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of Vincent's death. She mentioned his earneſt deſire to ſee the marquis, and repeated his laſt words. The marquis remained ſilent, and Madame proceeded to mention thoſe circumſtances relative to the ſouthern diviſion of the caſtle, which ſhe thought it of ſo much importance to diſcover. He treated the affair very lightly, laughed at her conjectures, repreſented the appearances ſhe deſcribed as the illuſions of a weak and timid mind, and broke up the converſation, by going to viſit the chamber of Vincent, in which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained a conſiderable time.</p>
               <p>On the following day Emilia and Julia dined with the marquis. He was gloomy and ſilent; their efforts to amuſe him ſeemed to excite diſpleaſure rather than kindneſs: and when the repaſt was concluded, he withdrew to his own apartment, leaving his daughters in a ſtate of ſorrow and ſurpriſe.</p>
               <p>Vincent was to be interred, according to his own deſire, in the church belonging to the convent of St. Nicholas. One of the ſervants, after receiving ſome neceſſary orders concerning the funeral, ventured to inform the marquis of the appearance of the lights in the ſouth tower. He mentioned the ſuperſtitious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports that prevailed amongſt the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ouſhold, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained that the ſervants would not croſs the courts af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it was dark. "And who is he that has commi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned you with this ſtory?" ſaid the marquis, in a tone
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:029381_0017_0FE0D1A1EE786490"/>
of diſpleaſure; are the weak and ridiculous fancies of women and ſervants to be obtruded upon my notice? Away—appear no more before me, till you have learned to ſpeak what it is proper for me to hear." Robert withdrew abaſhed, and it was ſome time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any perſon ventured to renew the ſubject with the marquis.</p>
               <p>The majority of young Ferdinand now drew near, and the marquis determined to celebrate the occaſion with feſtive magnificence at the caſtle of Mazzini. He therefore ſummoned the marchioneſs, and his ſon, from Naples, and very ſplendid preparations were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to be made. Emilia and Julia dreaded the arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of the marchioneſs, whoſe influence they had long been ſenſible of, and from whoſe preſence they antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated a painful reſtraint. Beneath the gentle gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Madame de Menon, their hours had paſſed in happy tranquillity, for they were ignorant alike of the ſorrows and the pleaſures of the world. Thoſe did not oppreſs, and theſe did not inflame them. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the purſuits of knowledge, and in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of elegant accompliſhments, their moments, flew lightly away, and the flight of time was marked only by improvement. In Madame was united the tenderneſs of the mother, with the ſympathy of a friend; and they loved her with a warm and inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble affection.</p>
               <p>The purpoſed viſit of their brother, whom they had not ſeen for ſeveral years, gave them great pleaſure. Although their minds retained no very diſtinct remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of him, they looked forward with eager <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd delightful expectation to his virtues and his talents; and hoped to find in his company, a conſolation for the uneaſineſs which the preſence of the marchioneſs would excite. Neither did Julia contemplate with indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:029381_0018_0FE0D1A8C839AEB0"/>
the approaching feſtival. A new ſcene was now opening to her, which her young imagination paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the warm and glowing colours of delight. The near approach of pleaſure frequently awakens the heart to emotions, which would fail to be excited by a more remote and abſtracted obſervance. Julia, who in the diſtance, had conſidered the ſplendid gaieties of life with tranquillity, now lingered with impatient hope through the moments which withheld her from their enjoyments. Emilia, whoſe feelings were leſs lively, and whoſe imagination was leſs powerful, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the approaching feſtival with calm conſideration, and almoſt regretted the interruption of thoſe tranquil pleaſures, which ſhe knew to be more congenial with her powers and diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>In a few days the marchioneſs arrived at the caſtle. She was followed by a numerous retinue, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by Ferdinand, and ſeveral of the Italian nob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, whom pleaſure attracted to her train. Her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance was proclaimed by the ſound of muſic, and thoſe gates, which had long ruſted on their hinges, were thrown open to receive her. The courts and halls, whoſe aſpect ſo lately expreſſed only gloom and deſolation, now ſhone with ſudden ſplendor, and echo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſounds of gaiety and gladneſs. Julia ſurveyed the ſcene from an obſcure window; and as the trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal ſtrains filled the air, her breaſt throbbed, her heart beat quick with joy, and ſhe loſt her apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the marchioneſs in a ſort of wild delight hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto unknown to her. The arrival of the marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſeemed indeed the ſignal of univerſal and unlimit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed pleaſure. When the marquis came out to receive her, the gloom that lately clouded his countenance, broke away in ſmiles of welcome, which the whole company appeared to conſider as invitations to joy.</p>

Julia pointed out to her ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the graceful figure of a young man who followed the marchioneſs, and ſhe expreſſed her wiſhes that he might be her brother. From the contemplation of the ſcene before them, they were ſummoned to meet the marchioneſs. Julia trembled with apprehenſion, and for a few moments wiſhed the caſtle was in its former ſtate. As they advanced through the ſaloon, in which they were preſented, Julia was covered with bluſhes, but Emilia, tho' equally timid, preſerved her graceful dignity. The marchioneſs received them with a min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled ſmile of condeſcenſion and politeneſs, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately the whole attention of the company was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by their elegance and beauty. The eager eyes of Julia ſought in vain to diſcover her brother, of whoſe features ſhe had no recollection in thoſe of any of the perſons then preſent. At length her father pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him, and ſhe perceived with a ſigh of regret, that he was not the youth ſhe had obſerved from the window. He advanced with a very engaging air, and ſhe met him with an unfeigned welcome. His figure was tall and majeſtic; he had a very noble and ſpirited carriage; and his countenance expreſſed at once ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and dignity. Supper was ſerved in the eaſt hall, and the tables were ſpread with a profuſion of delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. A band of muſick played during the repaſt, and the evening concluded with a concert in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loon.</p>

               <p>THE day of the feſtival, ſo long and ſo impatient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly looked for by Julia, was now arrived. All the neighbouring nobility were invited, and the gates of the caſtle were thrown open for a general rejoicing. A magnificent entertainment, conſiſting of the moſt luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and expenſive diſhes, was ſerved in the balls. Soft muſic floated along the vaulted roofs, the walls were hung with decorations, and it ſeemed as if the hand of a magician had ſuddenly metamorphoſed this once gloomy fabric into the palace of a fairy. The mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis, notwithſtanding the gaiety of the ſcene<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeared abſtracted from its enjoyments, and in ſpite of all his efforts at cheerfulneſs, the melancholy of his heart was viſible in his countenance.</p>
               <p>In the evening there was a grand ball: the marchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneſs, who was ſtill diſtinguiſhed for her beauty, and for the winning elegance of her manners, appeared in the moſt ſplendid attire. Her hair was ornamented with a profuſion of jewels, but was ſo diſpoſed as to give an air rather of voluptuouſneſs, than of grace, to her figure. Although conſcious of her charms, ſhe beheld the beauty of Emilia and Julia with a jealous eye, and was compelled ſecretly to acknowledge, that the ſimple elegance with which they were adorned, was more enchanting than all the ſtudied artifice of ſplendid decoration. They were dreſſed alike in light Sicilian habits, and the beautiful luxuriance of their flowing hair, was reſtrained only by bandellets of pearl. The ball was opened by Ferdinand, and the lady Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda Conſtanza. Emilia danced with the young mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis della Fazelli, and acquitted herſelf with the eaſe and dignity ſo natural to her. Julia experienced a
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:029381_0021_0FE0D1B84BC59490"/>
various emotion of pleaſure and fear when the count de Vereza, in whom ſhe recollected the cavalier ſhe had obſerved from the window, led her forth. The grace of her ſtep, and the elegant ſymmetry of her figure, raiſed in the aſſembly a gentle murmur of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applauſe, and the ſoft bluſh which now ſtole over her cheek, gave an additional charm to her appearance. But when the muſic changed, and ſhe danced to the ſoft Sicilian meaſure, the airy grace of her movement, and the unaffected tenderneſs of her air, ſunk attention into ſilence, which continued for ſome time after the dance had ceaſed. The marchioneſs obſerved the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral admiration with ſeeming pleaſure, and ſecret un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs. She had ſuffered a very painful ſolicitude, when the count de Vereza ſelected her for his partner in the dance, and ſhe purſued him through the evening, with an eye of jealous ſcrutiny. Her boſom, which before glowed only with love, was now torn by the agitation of other paſſions more violent and deſtructive. Her thoughts were reſtleſs, her mind wandered from the ſcene before her, and it required all her addreſs to preſerve an apparent eaſe. She ſaw, or fancied ſhe ſaw, an impaſſioned air in the count, when he addreſſed himſelf to Julia, that corroded her heart with jealous fury.</p>
               <p>At twelve the gates of the caſtle were thrown open, and the company quitted it for the woods, which were ſplendidly illuminated. Arcades of light lined the long viſtas, which were terminated by pyramids of lamps that preſented to the eye one bright column of flame. At irregular diſtances buildings were erected, hung with variagated lamps diſpoſed in the gayeſt and moſt fantaſtic forms. Collations were ſpread under the trees; and muſic, touched by unſeen hands, breathed around. The muſicians were placed in the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:029381_0022_0FE0D1BF428FF1E0"/>
moſt obſcure and embowered ſpots, ſo as to elude the eye and ſtrike the imagination. The ſcene appeared enchanted. Nothing met the eye but beauty, and romantic ſplendor; the ear received no ſounds but thoſe of mirth and melody. The younger part of the company formed themſelves into groups which at in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals glanced through the woods, and were again unſeen. Julia ſeemed the magic queen of the place. Her heart dilated with pleaſure, and diffuſed over her features an expreſſion of pure and complacent delight. A generous, frank, and exalted ſentiment ſparkled in her eyes, and animated her manner. Her boſom glowed with benevolent affections; and ſhe ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed anxious to impart to all around her, a happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as unmixed as that ſhe experienced. Wherever ſhe moved, admiration followed her ſteps. Ferdinand was as gay as the ſcene around him. Emilia was pleaſed; and the marquis ſeemed to have left his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy in the caſtle. The marchioneſs alone was wretched. She ſupped with a ſelect party, in a pavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion on the ſea ſhore, which was fitted up with peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar elegance. It was hung with white ſilk, drawn up in feſtoons, and richly fringed with gold. The ſofas were of the ſame materials, and alternate wreaths of roſes entwined the columns. A row of ſmall lamps placed about the cornice, formed an edge of light round the roof, which, with the other numerous lights, was reflected in a blaze of ſplendor from the large mirrors that adorned the room. The count Muriani was of the party;—he complimented the marchioneſs on the beauty of her daughters; and after lamenting with gaiety the captives which their charms would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thral, he mentioned the count de Vereza, "He is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly of all others the man moſt deſerving the lady Julia. As they danced, I thought they exhibited a
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:029381_0023_0FE0D1C3F0B45A70"/>
perfect model of the beauty of either ſex; and if I miſtake not, they are inſpired with a mutual admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on." The marchioneſs, endeavouring to conceal her uneaſineſs, ſaid, "Yes, my lord, I allow the count all the merit you adjudge him, but from the little I have ſeen of his diſpoſition, he is too volatile for a ſerious attachment."—At that inſtant the count entered the pavillion: "Ah, ſaid Muria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi, laughingly, you was the ſubject of our converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſeem to be come in good time to receive the honours alloted you. I was interceding with the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs for her intereſt in your favour, with the lady Julia; but ſhe abſolutely refuſes it; and though ſhe allows you merit, alledges, that you are by nature fickle and inconſtant. What ſay you—would not the beauty of lady Julia bind your unſteady heart?"</p>
               <p>"I know not how I have deſerved that character of the marchioneſs," ſaid the count, with a ſmile, "but that heart muſt be either fickle or inſenſible in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common degree, which can boaſt of freedom in the preſence of lady Julia." The marchioneſs, mortified by the whole converſation, now felt the full force of Vereza's reply, which ſhe imagined he pointed with particular emphaſis.</p>
               <p>The entertainment concluded with a grand firework, which was exhibited on the margin of the ſea, and the company did not part till the dawn of morning. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia retired from the ſcene with regret. She was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted with the new world that was now exhibited to her, and ſhe was not cool enough to diſtinguiſh the vivid glow of imagination from the colours of real bliſs. The pleaſure ſhe now felt, ſhe believed would always be renewed, and in an equal degree, by the objects which firſt excited it. The weakneſs of humanity is never willingly perceived by young minds.
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:029381_0024_0FE0D1C894684DE0"/>
It is painful to know, that we are operated upon by objects whoſe impreſſions are variable as they are inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finable—and that what yeſterday affected us ſtrongly, is to-day but imperfectly felt, and to-morrow perhaps ſhall be diſregarded. When at length this unwelcome truth is received into the mind, we at firſt reject, with diſguſt, every appearance of good, we diſdain to partake of a happineſs which we cannot always com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and we not unfrequently ſink into a temporary deſpair. Wiſdom or accident at length, recall us from our error, and offers to us ſome object capable of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing a pleaſing, yet laſting effect, which effect, therefore, we call happineſs. Happineſs has this eſſential difference from what is commonly called pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure; that virtue forms its baſis, and virtue being the offspring of reaſon, may be expected to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce uniformity of effect.</p>
               <p>The paſſions which had hitherto lain concealed in Julia's heart, touched by circumſtance, dilated to its power, and afforded her a ſlight experience of the pain and delight which flow from their influence. The beauty and accompliſhments of Vereza, raiſed in her a new and various emotion, which reflexion made her fear to encourage, but which was too pleaſing to be wholly reſiſted. Tremblingly alive to a ſenſe of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and unchilled by diſappointment, the young heart welcomes every feeling, not ſimply painful, with a romantic expectation, that it will expand into bliſs.</p>
               <p>Julia ſought with eager anxiety to diſcover the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of Vereza towards her; ſhe revolved each cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of the day, but they afforded her little ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; they reflected only a glimmering and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain light, which inſtead of guiding, ſerved only to perplex her. Now ſhe remembered ſome inſtance of particular attention, and then ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

indifference. She compared his conduct with that of the other young nobleſſe; and thought each ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared equally deſirous of the favour of every lady preſent. All the ladies, however, appeared to her to court the admiration of Vereſa, and ſhe trembled leſt he ſhould be too ſenſible of the diſtinction. She drew from theſe reflexions no poſitive inference; and though diſtruſt rendered pain the predominant ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it was exquiſitely interwoven with delight, that ſhe could not wiſh it exchanged for her former eaſe. Thoughtful and reſtleſs, ſleep fled from her eyes, and ſhe longed with impatience for the morning, which ſhould again preſent Vereza, and enable her to purſue the inquiry. She aroſe early, and adorned herſelf with unuſual care. In her favourite cloſet ſhe awaited the hour of breakfaſt, and endeavoured to read, but her thoughts wandered from the ſubject. Her lute and favourite airs loſt half their power to pleaſe; the day ſeemed to ſtand ſtill—ſhe became melancholy, and thought the breakfaſt hour would never arrive. At length the clock ſtruck the ſignal, the ſound vibrated on every nerve, and trembling ſhe quitted the cloſet for her ſiſter's apartment. Love taught her diſguiſe. Till then Emilia had ſhared all her thoughts; they now deſcended to the breakfaſt room in ſilence, and Julia almoſt feared to meet her eye. In the breakfaſt room they were alone. Julia found it impoſſible to ſupport a converſation with Emilia, whoſe obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons interrupting the courſe of her thoughts, became unintereſting and tireſome. She was therefore about to retire to her cloſet, when the marquis entered. His air was haughty, and his look ſevere. He coldly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted his daughters, and they had ſcarcely time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to his general inquiries, when the marchioneſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:029381_0026_0FE0D1D5C5E72390"/>
and company ſoon after aſſembled. Julia, who had awaited with ſo painful an impatience for the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which ſhould preſent Vereza to her ſight, now ſighed that it was arrived. She ſcarcely dared to lift her timid eyes from the ground, and when by accident they met his, a ſoft tremour ſeized her; and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, leſt he ſhould diſcover her ſentiments, ſerved only to render her confuſion conſpicuous. At length a glance from the marchioneſs recalled her bewildered thoughts; and other fears ſuperſeding thoſe of love, her mind, by degrees, recovered its dignity. She could diſtinguiſh in the behaviour of Vereza no ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of particular admiration, and ſhe reſolved to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct herſelf towards him with the moſt ſcrupulous care.</p>
               <p>This day, like the preceding one, was devoted to joy. In the evening there was a concert, which was chiefly performed by the nobility. Ferdinand played the violincello, Vereza the german flute, and Julia the piano forte, which ſhe touched with a delicacy and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution that engaged every auditor. The confuſion of Julia may be eaſily imagined, when Ferdinand, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting a beautiful duet, deſired Vereza would accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany his ſiſter. The pride of conſcious excellence, however, quickly overcame her timidity, and enabled her to exert all her power. The air was ſimple and pathetic, and ſhe gave it thoſe charms of expreſſion ſo peculiarly her own. She ſtruck the chords of her piano forte in beautiful accompaniment, and towards the cloſe of the ſecond ſtanza, her voice reſting on one note, ſwelled into a tone ſo exquiſite, and from thence deſcended to a few ſimple notes, which ſhe touched with ſuch impaſſioned tenderneſs that every eye wept to the ſounds. The breath of the flute trembled, and
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:029381_0027_0FE0D1DB90F070E8"/>
Hippolitus entranced, forgot to play. A pauſe of ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence enſued at the concluſion of the piece, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued till a general ſigh ſeemed to awaken the audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from their enchantment. Amid the general ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, Hippolitus was ſilent. Julia obſerved his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, and gently raiſing her eyes to his, there read the ſentiments which ſhe had inſpired. An exquiſite emotion thrilled her heart, and ſhe experienced one of thoſe rare moments which illumine life with a ray of bliſs, by which the darkneſs of its general ſhade is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſted. Care, doubt, every diſagreeable ſenſation vaniſhed, and for the remainder of the evening ſhe was conſcious only of delight. A timid reſpect marked the manner of Hippolitus, more flattering to Julia than the moſt ardent profeſſions. The evening con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with a ball, and Julia was again the partner of the count.</p>
               <p>When the ball broke up, ſhe retired to her apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but not to ſleep. Joy is as reſtleſs as anxiety or ſorrow. She ſeemed to have entered upon a new ſtate of exiſtence;—thoſe fine ſprings of affection which had hitherto lain concealed, were now touched, and yielded to her a happineſs more exalted than any her imagination had ever painted. She reflected on the tranquillity of her paſt life, and comparing it with the emotions of the preſent hour, exulted in the difference. All her former pleaſures now appeared inſipid; ſhe wondered that they ever had power to affect her, and that ſhe had endured with content the dull uniformity to which ſhe had been condemned. It was now only that ſhe appeared to live. Abſorbed in the ſingle idea of being beloved, her imagination ſoared into the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of romantic bliſs, and bore her high above the poſſibility of evil. Since ſhe was beloved by Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litus, ſhe could only be happy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="unknown:029381_0028_0FE0D1DF2F47FD18"/>From this ſtate of entranced delight, ſhe was awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſound of muſic immediately under her win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. It was a lute touched by a maſterly hand. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a wild and melancholy ſymphony, a voice of more than magic expreſſion ſwelled into an air ſo pathetic and tender, that it ſeemed to breathe the very ſoul of love. The chords of the lute were ſtruck in low and ſweet accompaniment, Julia liſtened, and diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the following words:

               <p>An interval of ſilence followed, and the air was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated; after which the muſic was heard no more. If before Julia believed that ſhe was loved by Hippoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, ſhe was now confirmed in the ſweet reality. But ſleep at length fell upon her ſenſes, and the airy forms of ideal bliſs no longer flected before her imagination. Morning came, and ſhe aroſe light and refreſhed. How different were her preſent ſenſations from thoſe of the preceding day. Her anxiety had now evapor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in joy, and ſhe experienced that airy dance of ſpirits which accumulated delight from every object; and with a power like the touch of enchantment, can transform a gloomy deſert into a ſmiling Eden. She flew to the breakfaſt room, ſcarcely conſcious of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but, as ſhe entered it, a ſoft confuſion overcame
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:029381_0029_0FE0D1E5EA3275B0"/>
her; ſhe bluſhed, and almoſt feared to meet the eyes of Vereza. She was preſently relieved, however, for the count was not there. The company aſſembled— Julia watched <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e entrance of every perſon with pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful anxiety, but he for whom ſhe looked did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. Surpriſed and uneaſy, ſhe fixed her eyes on the door, and whenever it opened, her heart beat with an expectation which was as often checked by diſappointment. In ſpite of all her efforts her vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacity ſunk into languor, and ſhe then perceived that love may produce other ſenſations than thoſe of delight. She found it poſſible to be unhappy, though loved by Hippolitus; and acknowledged with a ſigh of regret, which was yet new to her, how trembling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly her peace depended upon him. He neither appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nor was mentioned at breakfaſt; but though deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy prevented her inquiring after him, converſation ſoon became irkſome to her, and ſhe retired to the apartment of Madame de Menon. There ſhe employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed herſelf in painting, and endeavoured to beguile the time till the hour of dinner, when ſhe hoped to ſee Hippolitus. Madame was as uſual, friendly and cheerful, but ſhe perceived a reſerve in the conduct of Julia, and penetrated without difficulty into its cauſe. She was, however, ignorant of the object of her pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pil's admiration. The hour ſo eagerly deſired by Julia at length arrived, and with a palpitating heart ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the hall. The count was not there, and in the courſe of converſation, ſhe learned that he had that morning ſailed for Naples. The ſcene which ſo late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeared enchanting to her eyes, now changed its hue; and in the midſt of ſociety, and ſurrounded by gaiety, ſhe was ſolitary and dejected. She accuſed herſelf of having ſuffered her wiſhes to miſlead her
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:029381_0030_0FE0D1EAA59FED70"/>
judgment; and the preſent conduct of Hippolitus convinced her, that ſhe had miſtaken admiration, for a ſentiment more tender. She believed too, that the muſician who had addreſſed her in his ſonnet, was not the count; and thus at once was diſſolved all the ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al fabrick of her happineſs. How ſhort a period of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten reverſes the character of our ſentiments, rendering that which yeſterday we deſpiſed, to day deſirable. The tranquil ſtate which ſhe had ſo lately delighted to quit, ſhe now reflected upon with regret. She had, however, the conſolation of believing that her ſentiments towards the count were unknown, and the ſweet conſciouſneſs that her conduct had been govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a nice ſenſe of propriety.</p>
               <p>The public rejoicings at the caſtle cloſed with the week; but the gay ſpirit of the marchioneſs forbade a return to tranquillity; and ſhe ſubſtituted diverſions more private, but in ſplendour ſcarcely inferior to the preceding ones. She had obſerved the behaviour of Hippolitus on the night of the concert with chagrin, and his departure with ſorrow; yet diſdaining to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate misfortunes by reflexion, ſhe ſought to loſe the ſenſe of diſappointment in the hurry of diſſipati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But her efforts to eraſe him from her remembrance were ineffectual. Unaccuſtomed to oppoſe the bent of her inclinations, they now maintained unbounded ſway; and ſhe found too late, that in order to have a due command of our paſſions, it is neceſſary to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject them to early obedience. Paſſion, in its undue influence, produces weakneſs as well as injuſtice. The pain which now recoiled upon her heart from diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, ſhe had not ſtrength of mind to endure, and ſhe ſought relief from its preſſure in afflicting the innocent. Julia, whoſe beauty ſhe imagined had capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated

Arts, which individually are inconſiderable, but in the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregate, amount to a cruel and deciſive effect.</p>
               <p>From Julia's mind the idea of happineſs was now faded. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>leaſure had withdrawn her beam from the proſpect, and the objects no longer illumined by her ray, became dark and colourleſs. As often as her ſituation would permit, ſhe withdrew from ſociety, and ſought the freedom of ſolitude, where ſhe could indulge in melancholy thoughts, and give a looſe to that deſpair which is ſo apt to follow the diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our firſt hopes.</p>
               <p>Week after week elapſed, yet no mention was made of returning to Naples. The marquis at length de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared it his intention to ſpend the remainder of the ſummer in the caſtle. To this determination the marchioneſs ſubmitted with decent reſignation, for ſhe was here ſurrounded by a croud of flatterers, and and her invention ſupplied her with continual diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: that gaiety which rendered Naples ſo dear to her, glittered in the woods of Mazzini, and reſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through the caſtle.</p>
               <p>The apartments of Madame de Menon were ſpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and noble. The windows opened upon the ſea, and commanded a view of the ſtraits of Meſſina, bounded on one ſide by the beautiful ſhores of the iſle of Sicily, and on the other by the high mountains of Calabria. The ſtraits filled with veſſels whoſe gay ſtreamers glittered to the ſun beam, preſented to the eye an ever moving ſcene. The principal room opened upon a gallery that overhung the grand terrace of
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:029381_0032_0FE0D1F5340F29E8"/>
the caſtle, and it commanded a proſpect which for beauty and extent has ſeldom been equalled. Theſe were formerly conſidered the chief apartments of the caſtle; and when the marquis quitted them for Naples, were alotted for the reſidence of Madame de Menon, and her young charge. The marchioneſs, ſtruck with the proſpect which the windows afforded, and the pleaſantneſs of the gallery, determined to reſtore the rooms to their former ſplendour. She ſignified this intention to Madame, for whom other apartments were provided. The chambers of Emilia and Julia forming part of the ſuite, they were alſo claimed by the marchioneſs, who left Julia only her favourite clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet. The rooms to which they removed, were ſpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous but gloomy; they had been for ſome years unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited; and though preparations had been made for the reception of their new inhabitants, an air of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation reigned within them that inſpired melancholy ſenſations. Julia obſerved that her chamber, which opened beyond Madame's, formed a part of the ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern building, with which, however, there appeared no means of communication. The late myſterious circumſtances relating to this part of the fabrick, now aroſe to her imagination, and conjured up a terror which reaſon could not ſubdue. She told her emoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Madame, who, with more prudence than ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, laughed at her fears. The behaviour of the marquis, the dying words of Vincent, together with the preceding circumſtances of alarm, had ſunk deep in the mind of Madame, but ſhe ſaw the neceſſity of confining to her own breaſt, doubts which time only could reſolve.</p>
               <p>Julia endeavoured to reconcile herſelf to the change, and a circumſtance ſoon occurred which obliterated
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:029381_0033_0FE0D1FAA1D51260"/>
her preſent ſenſations, and excited others far more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting. One day that ſhe was arranging ſome pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers in the ſmall drawers of a cabinet that ſtood in her apartment, ſhe found a picture which fixed all her attention. It was a miniature of a lady, whoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance was touched with ſorrow, and expreſſed an air of dignified reſignation. The mournful ſweetneſs of her eyes, raiſed towards Heaven with a look of ſupplication, and the melancholy languor that ſhaded her features, ſo deeply affected Julia, that her eyes were filled with involuntary tears. She ſighed and wept, ſtill gazing on the picture, which ſeemed to engage her by a kind of faſcination. She almoſt fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied that the portrait breathed, and that the eyes were fixed on her's with a look of penetrating ſoftneſs. Full of the emotions which the miniature had excited, ſhe preſented it to Madame, whoſe mingled ſorrow and ſurpriſe increaſed her curioſity. But what were the various ſenſations which preſſed upon her heart, on learning that ſhe had wept over the reſemblance of her mother! Deprived of a mother's tenderneſs before ſhe was ſenſible of its value, it was now only that ſhe mourned the event which lamentation could not recall. Emilia, with an emotion as exquiſite, mingled her tears with thoſe of her ſiſter. With eager impatience they preſſed Madame to diſcloſe the cauſe of that ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row which ſo emphatically marked the features of their mother.</p>
               <p>"Alas! my dear children," ſaid Madame, deeply ſighing, "you engage me in a taſk too ſevere, not only for your peace, but for mine; ſince in giving you the information you require, I muſt retrace ſcenes of my own life, which I wiſh for ever obliterated. It would however, be both cruel and unjuſt to with-hold
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:029381_0034_0FE0D1FFE019D988"/>
an explanation ſo nearly intereſting to you, and I will ſacrifice my own eaſe to your wiſhes."</p>
               <p>"Louiſa de Bernini, your mother, was as you well know, the only daughter of the count de Bernini. Of the misfortunes of your family, I believe you are yet ignorant. The chief eſtates of the count were ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the <hi>Val di Demona,</hi> a valley deriving its name from its vicinity to Mount Aetna, which vulgar tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has peopled with devils. In one of thoſe dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful eruptions of Aetna, which deluged this valley with a flood of fire, a great part of your grandfather's do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in that quarter were laid waſte. The count was at that time with a part of his family at Meſſina, but the counteſs and her ſon, who were in the country, were deſtroyed. The remaining property of the count was proportionably inconſiderable, and the loſs of his wife and ſon deeply affected him. He retired with Louiſa, his only ſurviving child, who was then near fifteen, to a ſmall eſtate near Catania. There was ſome degree of relationſhip between your grandfather and myſelf; and your mother was attached to me by the ties of ſentiment, which, as we grew up, united us ſtill more ſtrongly than thoſe of blood. Our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and our taſtes were the ſame; and a ſimilarity of misfortunes might, perhaps, contribute to cement our early friendſhip. I, like herſelf, had loſt a parent in the eruption of Aetna. My mother had died before I underſtood her value, but my father, whom I rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and tenderly loved, was deſtroyed by one of thoſe terrible events; his lands were buried beneath the lava, and he left an only ſon and myſelf to mourn his fate, and encounter the evils of poverty. The count, who, was our neareſt ſurviving relation, generouſly took us home to his houſe, and declared that he conſidered us
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:029381_0035_0FE0D2056BAB42A0"/>
as his children. To amuſe his leiſure hours, he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to finiſh the education of my brother, who was then about ſeventeen, and whoſe riſing genius promiſed to reward the labours of the count. Louiſa and myſelf often ſhared the inſtruction of her father, and at thoſe hours Orlando was generally of the party. The tranquil retirement of the count's ſituation, the rational employment of his time between his own ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, the education of thoſe whom he called his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and the converſation of a few ſelect friends, anticipated the effect of time, and ſoftened the aſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his diſtreſs into a tender complacent melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. As for Louiſa and myſelf, who were yet new in life, and whoſe ſpirits poſſeſſed the happy elaſticity of youth, our minds gradually ſhifted from ſuffering to tranquillity, and from tranquillity to happineſs. I have ſometimes thought that when my brother has been reading to her a delightful paſſage, the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Louiſa diſcovered a tender intereſt, which ſeemed to be excited rather by the reader than by the author. Theſe days, which were ſurely the moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viable of our lives, now paſſed in ſerene enjoyments, and in continual gradations of improvement.</p>
               <p>"The count deſigned my brother for the army, and the time now drew nigh when he was to join the Sicilian regiment, in which he had a commiſſion. The abſent thoughts, and dejected ſpirits of my cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin, now diſcovered to me the ſecret which had long been concealed even from herſelf; for it was not till Orlando was about to depart, that ſhe perceived how dear he was to her peace. On the eve of his departure, the count lamented with fatherly, yet manly tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the diſtance which was ſoon to ſeparate us. "But we ſhall meet again," ſaid he,
<q>when the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of war ſhall have rewarded the bravery of my
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:029381_0036_0FE0D20B63380978"/>
ſon.</q>
Louiſa grew pale, a half ſuppreſſed ſigh eſcaped her, and to conceal her emotion ſhe turned to her harpſicord.</p>
               <p>"My brother had a favourite dog which, before he ſet off, he preſented to Louiſa, and committing it to her care, begged ſhe would be kind to it, and ſometimes remember its maſter. He checked his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing emotion, but as he turned from her, I perceived the tear that wetted his cheek. He departed, and with him the ſpirit of our happineſs ſeemed to evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. The ſeenes which his preſence had formerly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livened, were now forlorn and melancholy, yet we loved to wander in what were once his favourite haunts. Louiſa forbore to mention my brother even to me, but frequently when ſhe thought herſelf unob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, ſhe would ſteal to her harpſicord, and repeat the ſtr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n which ſhe had played on the evening before his departure.</p>
               <p>"We had the pleaſure to hear from time to time that he was well; and though his own modeſty threw a veil over his conduct, we could collect from other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts that he had behaved with great bravery. At length the time of his return approached, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livened ſpirits of Louiſa declared the influence he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retained in her heart. He returned bearing public teſtimony of his valour in the honours which had been conferred upon him. He was received with univerſal joy; the count welcomed him with the pride and fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a father, and the villa became again the ſeat of happineſs. His perſon and manners were much improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the elegant beauty of the youth was now exchanged for the graceful dignity <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> manhood, and ſome know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the world was added to that of the ſciences. The joy which illumined his countenance when he met Louiſa, ſpoke at once his admiration and his love;
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:029381_0037_0FE0D210F7BF3998"/>
and the bluſh which her obſervation of it brought upon her cheek, would have diſcovered even to an uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted ſpectator that this joy was mutual.</p>
               <p>"Orlando brought with him a young Frenchman, a brother officer, who had reſcued him from imminent danger in battle, and whom he introduced to the count as his preſerver. The count received him with grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and diſtinction, and he was for a conſiderable time an inmate at the villa. His manners were ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly pleaſing, and his underſtanding was cultivated and refined. He ſoon diſcovered a partiality for me, and he was indeed too pleaſing to be ſeen with indifference. Gratitude for the valuable life he had preſerved, was perhaps the ground work of an eſteem which ſoon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed into the moſt affectionate love. Our attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment grew ſtronger as our acquaintance increaſed; and at length the chevalier de Menon aſked me of the count, who conſulted my heart, and finding it favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the connexion, proceeded to make the neceſſary inquiries concerning the family of the ſtranger. He obtained a ſatisfactory and pleaſing account of it. The chevalier was the ſecond ſon of a French gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of large eſtates in France, who had been ſome years deceaſed. He had left ſeveral ſons; the family eſtate, of courſe, devolved to the eldeſt, but to the two younger he had bequeathed conſiderable property. Our marriage was ſolemnized in a private manner at the villa, in the preſence of the count, Louiſa, and my brother. Soon after the nuptials, my huſband and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lando were remanded to their regiments. My bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's affections were now unalterably fixed upon Louiſa, but a ſentiment of delicacy and generoſity ſtill kept him ſilent. He thought, poor as he was, to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licit the hand of Louiſa, would be to repay the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the count with ingratitude. I have ſeen the
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:029381_0038_0FE0D2148F358248"/>
inward ſtruggles of his heart, and mine has bled for him. The count and Louiſa ſo earneſtly ſolicited me to remain at the villa during the campaign, that at length my huſband conſented. We parted—O! let me forget that period!—Had I accompanied him, all might have been well; and the long—long years of affliction which followed had been ſpared me."</p>
               <p>The horn now ſounded the ſignal for dinner, and interrupted the narrative of Madame. Her beauteous auditors wiped the tears from their eyes, and with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme reluctance deſcended to the hall. The day was occupied with company and diverſions, and it was not till late in the evening that they were ſuffered to retire. They haſtened to Madame immediately upon their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing releaſed; and too much intereſted for ſleep, and too importunate to be repulſed, ſolicited the ſequel of her ſtory. She objected the lateneſs of the hour, but at length yielded to their entreaties. They drew their chairs cloſe to her's; and every ſenſe being abſorbed in the ſingle one of hearing, followed her through the courſe of her narrative.</p>
               <p>"My brother again departed without diſcloſing his ſentiments; the effort it coſt him was evident, but his ſenſe of honour ſurmounted every oppoſing conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Louiſa again drooped, and pined in ſilent ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. I lamented equally for my friend and my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and have a thouſand times accuſed that delicacy as falſe, which with-held them from the happineſs they might ſo eaſily and ſo innocently have obtained. The behaviour of the count, at leaſt to my eye, ſeemed to indicate the ſatisfaction which this union would have given him. It was about this period that the marquis Mazzini firſt ſaw and became enamoured of Louiſa. His propoſals were very flattering, but the count for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:029381_0039_0FE0D21B1F07AE08"/>
to exert the undue authority of a father; and he ceaſed to preſs the connexion, when he perceived that Louiſa was really averſe to it. Louiſa was ſenſible of the generoſity of his conduct, and ſhe could ſcarcely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the alliance without a ſigh, which her gratitude paid to the kindneſs of her father.</p>
               <p>"But an event now happened which diſſolved at once our happineſs, and all our air drawn ſchemes for futurity. A diſpute, which it ſeems originated in a trifle, but ſoon increaſed to a ſerious degree, aroſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Chevalier de Menon</hi> and my brother. It was decided by the ſword, and my dear brother fell by the hand of my huſband. I ſhall paſs over this period of my life. It is too painful for recollection. The effect of this event upon Louiſa was ſuch as may be imagined. The world was now become indifferent to her, and as ſhe had no proſpect of happineſs for her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſhe was unwilling to with-hold it from the father who had deſerved ſo much of her. After ſome time, when the marquis renewed his addreſſes, ſhe gave him her hand. The characters of the marquis and his lady were in their nature too oppoſite to form a happy union. Of this Louiſa was very ſoon ſenſible; and though the mildneſs of her diſpoſition made her tamely ſubmit to the unfeeling authority of her huſband, his behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſunk deep in her heart, and ſhe pined in ſecret. It was impoſſible for her to avoid oppoſing the charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the marquis to that of him upon whom her affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had been ſo fondly and ſo juſtly fixed. The compariſon increaſed her ſufferings, which ſoon preyed upon her conſtitution, and very viſibly affected her health. Her ſituation deeply afflicted the count, and united with the infirmities of age to ſhorten his life.</p>
               <p>"Upon his death, I bade ad eu to my couſin, and and quitted Sicily for Italy, where the Chevalier de
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:029381_0040_0FE0D22173498058"/>
Menon had for ſome time expected me. Our meeting was very affecting. My reſentment towards him was done away, when I obſerved his pale and altered coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and perceived the melancholy which preyed upon his heart. All the airy vivacity of his former manner was fled, and he was devoured by unavailing grief and remorſe. He deplored with unceaſing ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the friend he had murdered, and my preſence ſeemed to open afreſh the wounds which time had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to cloſe. His affliction, united with my own, was almoſt more than I could ſupport, but I was doomed to ſuffer, and endure yet more. In a ſubſequent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement my huſband, weary of exiſtence, ruſhed into the heat of battle, and there obtained an honourable death. In a paper which he left behind him, he ſaid it was his intention to die in that battle: that he had long wiſhed for death, and waited for an opportunity of obtaining it without ſtaining his own character by the cowardice of ſuicide, or diſtreſſing me by an act of butchery. This event gave the finiſhing ſtroke to my afflictions;—yet let me retract:—another misfortune awaited me when I leaſt expected one. The <hi>Chevalier de Menon</hi> died without a will, and his brothers refuſed to give up his eſtate, unleſs I could produce a witneſs of my marriage. I returned to Sicily, and to my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible ſorrow found that your mother had died during my ſtay abroad, a prey, I fear, to grief. The prieſt who performed the ceremony of my marriage, having been threatened with puniſhment for ſome ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical offences, had ſecretly left the country; and thus was I deprived of thoſe proofs which were neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to authenticate my claims to the eſtates of my huſband. His brothers, to whom I was an utter ſtranger, were either too prejudiced to believe, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, were too diſhonourable to acknowledge the
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:029381_0041_0FE0D226196D8D50"/>
juſtice of my ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ims. I was therefore at once abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſorrow and to poverty; a ſmall legacy from the count de Bernini being all that now remained to me.</p>
               <p>"When the marquis married Maria de Vellorno, which was about this period, he deſigned to quit Maz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zini for Naples. His ſon was to accompany him, but, it was his intention to leave you, who were both very young, to the care of ſome perſon qualified to ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intend your education. My circumſtances rendered the office acceptable, and my former friendſhip for your mother made the duty pleaſing to me. The mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis, was, I believe, glad to be ſcared the trouble of ſearching further for what he had hitherto found it difficult to obtain—a perſon whom inclination as well as duty would bind to his intereſt."</p>
               <p>Madame ceaſed to ſpeak, and Emilia and Julia wept to the memory of the mother, whoſe misfortunes this ſtory recorded. The ſufferings of Madame, together with her former friendſhip for the late marchioneſs, endeared her to her pupils, who from this period en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured by every kind and delicate attention to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literate the traces of her ſorrows. Madame was ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of this tenderneſs, and it was productive in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of the effect d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ed. But a ſubject ſoon after occurred, which draw off their minds from the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of their mother's fate to a ſubject more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful and equally intereſting.</p>
               <p>One night that Emilia and Julia had been detained, by company, in ceremonial reſtraint, later than uſual, they were induced by the eaſy converſation of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, and by the pleaſure which a return to liberty naturally produces to defer the hour of repoſe till the night was far advanced. They were engaged in inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting diſcourſe, when Madame, who was then ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was interrupted by a low hollow ſound, which
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:029381_0042_0FE0D22EDABCE4F8"/>
aroſe from beneath the apartment, and ſeemed like the cloſing of a door. Chilled into a ſilence, they liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and diſtinctly heard it repeated. Deadly ideas crowded upon their imaginations, and inſpired a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror which ſcarcely allowed them to breathe. The noiſe laſted only for a moment, and a profound ſilence ſoon enſued. Their feelings at length relaxed, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them to move to Madame's apartment, when again they heard the ſame ſounds. Almoſt diſtracted with fear, they ruſhed into Madame's apartment, where Emilia ſunk upon the bed and fainted. It was a conſiderable time ere the efforts of Madame recalled her to ſenſation. When they were again tranquil, ſhe employed all her endeavours to compoſe the ſpirits of the young ladies, and diſſuade them from alarming the caſtle. Involved in dark and fearful doubts, ſhe yet commanded her feelings, and endeavoured to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume an appearance of compoſure. The late behaviour of the marquis had convinced her that he was nearly connected with the myſtery which hung over this part of the edifice; and ſhe dreaded to excite his reſentment by a further mention of alarms, which were perhaps only ideal, and whoſe reality ſhe had certainly no means of proving.</p>
               <p>Influenced by theſe conſiderations, ſhe endeavoured to prevail on Emilia and Julia, to await in ſilence ſome confirmation of their ſurmiſes, but their terror made this a very difficult taſk. They acquieſced, however, ſo far with her wiſhes, as to agree to conceal the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding circumſtances from every perſon but their bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without whoſe protecting preſence they declared it utterly impoſſible to paſs another night in the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For the remainder of this night they reſolved to watch. To beguile the tediouſneſs of the time they endeavoured to converſe, but the minds of Emilia and
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:029381_0043_0FE0D23370AE7E70"/>
Julia were too much affected by the late occurrence to wander from the ſubject. They compared this with the foregoing circumſtance of the figure and the light which had appeared; their imaginations kindled wild conjectures, and they ſubmitted their opinions to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, entreating her to inform them ſincerely, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe believed that diſembodied ſpirits were ever permitted to viſit this earth.</p>
               <p>"My children," ſaid ſhe, "I will not attempt to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade you that the exiſtence of ſuch ſpirits is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Who ſhall ſay that any thing is impoſſible to God? We know that he has made us, who are embo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died ſpirits; he, therefore, can make unembodied ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. If we cannot underſtand how ſuch ſpirits exiſt, we ſhould conſider the limited powers of our minds, and that we cannot underſtand many things which are indiſputably true. No one yet knows why the magnet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ic needle points to the north; yet you, who have never ſeen a magnet, do not heſitate to believe that it has this tendency, becauſe you have been well aſſured of it, both from books and in converſation. Since, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we are ſure that nothing is impoſſible to God, and that ſuch beings <hi>may</hi> exiſt, though we can not tell how, we ought to conſider by what evidence their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence is ſupported. I do not ſay that ſpirits <hi>have</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared; but if ſeveral diſcreet unprejudiced perſon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> were to aſſure me that they had ſeen one, I ſhould not be proud or bold enough to reply—"it is impoſſible." Let not, however, ſuch conſiderations diſturb your minds. I have ſaid thus much, becauſe I was unwilling to impoſe upon your underſtandings; it is now your part to exerciſe your reaſon, and preſerve the unmov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed confidence of virtue. Such ſpirits, if indeed they have ever been ſeen, can have appeared only by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs permiſſion of God, and for ſome very ſingular

purpoſes; be aſſured that there are no beings who act unſeen by him; and that, therefore, there are none from whom innocence can ever ſuffer harm."</p>
               <p>No further ſounds diſturbed them for that time; and before the morning dawned, wearineſs inſenſibly overcame apprehenſion, and ſunk them in repoſe.</p>
               <p>When Ferdinand learned the circumſtances relating to the ſouthern ſide of the caſtle, his imagination ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with avidity each appearance of myſtery, and inſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with an irreſiſtible deſire to penetrate the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of this deſolate part of the fabric. He very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily conſented to watch with his ſiſters in Julia's apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but as his chamber was in a remote part of the caſtle, there would be ſome difficulty in paſſing unob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to her's. It was agreed, however, that when all was huſhed, he ſhould make the attempt. Having thus reſolved, Emilia and Julia waited the return of night with reſtleſs and fearful impatience.</p>
               <p>At length the family retired to reſt. The caſtle clock had ſtruck one, and Julia began to fear that Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand had been diſcovered, when a knocking was heard at the door of the outer chamber.</p>
               <p>Her heart beat with apprehenſions, which reaſon could not juſtify. Madame roſe, and inquiring what was there, was anſwered by the voice of Ferdinand. The door was cheerfully opened. They drew their chairs round him, and endeavoured to paſs the time in converſation; but fear and expectation attracted all their thoughts to one ſubject, and Madame alone pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved her compoſure. The hour was now come when the ſounds had been heard the preceding night, and every ear was given to attention. All, however, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained quiet, and the night paſſed without any new alarm.</p>
               <p>The greater part of ſeveral ſucceeding nights were
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:029381_0045_0FE0D23F07508730"/>
ſpent in watching, but no ſounds diſturbed their ſilence. Ferdinand, in whoſe mind the late circumſtances had excited a degree of aſtoniſhment and curioſity ſuperior to common obſtacles, determined, if poſſible, to gain admittance to thoſe receſſes of the caſtle which had for ſo many years been hid from human eye. This, however, was a deſign which we ſaw little probability of accompliſhing, for the keys of that part of the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice were in the poſſeſſion of the marquis, of whoſe late conduct he judged too well to believe he would ſuffer the apartments to be explored. He racked his inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the means of getting acceſs to them, and at length recollecting that Julia's chamber formed a part of theſe buildings, it occurred to him, that according to the mode of building in old times, there might for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly have been a communication between them. This conſideration ſuggeſted to him the poſſibility of a concealed door in her apartment, and he determined to ſurvey it on the following night with great care.</p>

               <p>THE caſtle was buried in ſleep when Ferdinand again joined his ſiſters in Madame's apartment. With anxious curioſity they followed him to the chamber. The room was hung with tapeſtry. Ferdinand care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſounded the wall which communicated with the ſouthern buildings. From one part of it a ſound was returned, which convinced him there was ſomething leſs ſolid than ſtone. He removed the tapeſtry, and behind it appeared, to his inexpreſſible ſatisfaction, a ſmall door. With a hand trembling through eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he undrew the bolts, and was ruſhing forward,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:029381_0046_0FE0D244C6766758"/>
when he perceived that a lock with held his paſſage. The keys of Madame and his ſiſters were applied in vain, and he was compelled to ſubmit to diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the very moment when he congratulated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on his ſucceſs, for he had with him no means of forcing the door.</p>
               <p>He ſtood gazing on the door, and inwardly lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when a low hollow ſound was heard from beneath. Emilia and Julia ſeized his arm; and almoſt ſinking with apprehenſion, liſtened in profound ſilence. A footſtep was diſtinctly heard, as if paſſing through the apartment below, after which all was ſtill. Ferdinand fired by this confirmation of the late report, ruſhed on to the door, and again tried to burſt his way, but it reſiſted all the efforts of his ſtrength. The ladies now rejoiced in that circumſtance which they ſo lately lamented; for the ſounds had renewed their terror, and though the night paſſed without further diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, their fears were very little abated.</p>
               <p>Ferdinand, whoſe mind was wholly occupied with wonder, could with difficulty await the return of night. Emilia and Julia were ſcarcely leſs impatient. They counted the minutes as they paſſed; and when the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily retired to reſt, haſtened with palpitating hearts to the apartment of Madame. They were ſoon after joined by Ferdinand, who brought with him tools for cutting away the lock of the door. They pauſed a few moments in the chamber in fearful ſilence, but no ſound diſturbed the ſtillneſs of night. Ferdinand ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied a knife to the door, and in a ſhort time ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the lock. The door yielded and diſcloſed a large and gloomy gallery. He took a light. Emilia and Julia, fearful of remaining in the chamber, reſolved to to accompany him, and each ſeizing an arm of Madame, they followed in ſilence. The gallery was in many
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:029381_0047_0FE0D24A2BDE29E0"/>
parts falling to decay, the cieling was broke, and the window ſhutters ſhattered, which, together with the dampneſs of the walls, gave the place an air of wild deſolation.</p>
               <p>They paſſed lightly on, for their ſteps ran in whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering echoes through the gallery, and often did Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia caſt a fearful glance around.</p>
               <p>The gallery terminated in a large old ſtair-caſe, which led to a hall below; on the left appeared ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral doors which ſeemed to lead to ſeparate apartments. While they heſitated which courſe to purſue, a light flaſhed faintly up the ſtair-caſe, and in a moment after paſſed away; at the ſame time was heard the ſound of a diſtant footſtep. Ferdinand drew his ſword and ſprang forward; his companions ſcreaming with er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, ran back to Madame's apartment.</p>
               <p>Ferdinand deſcended a large vaulted hall; he croſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it towards a low arched door which was left half open, and through which ſtreamed a ray of light. The door opened upon a narrow winding paſſage<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The paſſage grew narrower, and the frequent fragments of looſe ſtone, made it now difficult to proceed. A low door cloſed the avenue, reſembling that by which he had entered. He opened it, and diſcovered a ſquare room, from whence roſe a windng ſtair caſe, which led up the ſouth tower of the caſtle. Ferdinand pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to liſten; the ſound of ſteps had ceaſed, and all was profoundly ſilent. A door on the right attracted his notice; he tried to open it, but it was faſtened. He concluded, therefore, that the perſon, if indeed a human being it was that bore the light he had ſeen, had paſſed up the tower. After a momentary heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ooſeneſs of the ſtones rendered a footing very inſecure. Impelled by an irreſiſtible curioſity, he was undiſmay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and began the aſcent. He had not proceeded very far, when the ſtones of a ſtep which his foot had juſt quitted, looſened by his weight, gave way; and drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging with them thoſe adjoining, formed a chaſm in the ſtair-caſe that terrified even Ferdinand, who was left tottering on the ſuſpended half of the ſteps, in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary expectation of falling to the bottom with the ſtone on which he reſted. In the terror which this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned, he attempted to ſave himſelf by catching at a kind of beam which projected over the ſtairs, when the lamp dropped from his hand, and he was left in total darkneſs. Terror now uſurped the place of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry other intereſt, and he was utterly perplexed how to proceed. He feared to go on, leſt the ſteps above, as infirm as thoſe below, ſhould yield to his weight; —to return was impracticable, for the darkneſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the poſſibility of diſcovering a means. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, therefore, to remain in this ſituation till light ſhould d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>He had remained here above an hour, when he ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly heard a voice from below. It ſeemed to come from the paſſage leading to the tower, and percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly drew nearer. His agitation was now extreme, for he had no power of defending himſelf, and while he remained in this ſtate of torturing expectation, a blaze of light burſt upon the ſtair-caſe beneath him. In the ſucceeding moment he heard his own name ſounded from below. His apprehenſions inſtantly vaniſhed,
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:029381_0049_0FE0D253A82CE598"/>
for he diſtinguiſhed the voices of Madame and his ſiſters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>They had awaited his return in all the horrors of apprehenſion, till at length all fear for themſelves was loſt in thoſe concern for him; and they, who ſo lately had not dared to enter this part of the edifice, now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauntedly ſearched it in queſt of Ferdinand. What were their emotions when they diſcovered his perilous ſituation!</p>
               <p>The light now enabled him to take a more accurate ſurvey of the place. He perceived that ſome few ſtones of the ſteps which had fallen, ſtill remained attached to the wall, but he feared to truſt to their ſupport on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. He obſerved, however, that the wall itſelf was partly decayed, and conſequently rugged with the corners of half worn ſtones. On theſe ſmall projec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he contrived, with the aſſiſtance of the ſteps al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned, to ſuſpend himſelf, and at length gained the unbroken part of the ſtairs in ſafety. It is difficult to determine which individual of the party rejoiced moſt at this eſcape. The morning now dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Ferdinand deſiſted for the preſent from far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inquiry.</p>
               <p>The intereſt which theſe myſterious circumſtances excited in the mind of Julia, had with-drawn her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention from a ſubject more dangerous to its peace. The image of Vereza, notwithſtanding, would fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently intrude upon her fancy; and awakening the recollection of happy emotions, would call forth a ſigh which all her efforts could not ſuppreſs. She loved to indulge the melancholy of her heart in the ſolitude of the woods. One evening ſhe took her lute to a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite ſpot on the ſea ſhore, and reſigning herſelf in a pleaſing ſadneſs, touched ſome ſweet and plaintive airs.

The purple fluſh of evening was diffuſed over the heavens. The ſun, involved in clouds of ſplendid and innumerable hues, was ſetting o'er the diſtant water, whoſe clear boſom glowed with rich reflexion. The beauty of the ſcene, the ſoothing murmur of the high trees, waved by the light air which overſhadowed her, and the ſoft ſwelling of the waves that flowed gently in upon the ſhores, inſenſibly ſunk her mind into a ſtate of repoſe. She touched the chords of her lute in ſweet and wild melody, and ſung the following ode:

               <p>Having ceaſed to ſing, her fingers wandered over the lute in melancholy ſymphony, and for ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhe remained loſt in the ſweet ſenſations which the muſic and the ſcenery had inſpired.

               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="unknown:029381_0052_0FE0D266199967E0"/>"Never will I riſe, Madam," replied the count, with an impaſſioned air, "till."—He was interrupted by the marchioneſs who at this moment entered the grove. On obſerving the poſition of the count ſhe was retiring. "Stay Madam," ſaid Julia, almoſt ſinking under her confuſion. "By no means," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the marchioneſs, in a tone of irony, "my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence would only interrupt a very agreeable ſcene. The count, I ſee, is willing to pay you his earlieſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects." Saying this ſhe diſappeared, leaving Julia diſtreſſed and offended, and the count provoked at the intruſion. He attempted to renew the ſubject, but Julia haſtily followed the ſteps of the marchioneſs, and entered the caſtle.</p>
               <p>The ſcene ſhe had witneſſed, raiſed in the marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs a tumult of dreadful emotions. Love, hatred, and jealouſy, raged by turns in her heart, and defied all power of controul. Subjected to their alternate violence, ſhe experienced a miſery more acute than any ſhe had yet known. Her imagination, invigorat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by oppoſition, heightened to her the graces of Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politus; her boſom glowed with more intenſe paſſion, and her brain was at length exaſperated almoſt to madneſs.</p>
               <p>In Julia this ſudden and unexpected interview excit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a mingled emotion of love and vexation, which did not ſoon ſubſide. At length, however, the delightful conſciouſneſs of Vereza's love bore her high above every other ſenſation; again the ſcene more brightly glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and again her fancy overcame the poſſibility of evil.</p>
               <p>During the evening, a tender and timid reſpect diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed the behaviour of the count towards Julia, who, contented with the certainty of being loved, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to conceal her ſentiments till an explanation of
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:029381_0053_0FE0D26B02A6DD10"/>
his abrupt departure from Mazzini, and ſubſequent abſence, ſhould have diſſipated the ſhadow of myſtery which hung over this part of his conduct. She ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that the marchioneſs purſued her with ſteady and conſtant obſervation, and ſhe carefully avoided af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording the count an opportunity of renewing the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the preceding interview, which whenever he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached her ſeemed to tremble on his lips.</p>
               <p>Night returned, and Ferdinand repaired to the chamber of Julia to purſue his inquiry. Here he had not long remained, when the ſtrange and alarming ſounds which had been heard on the preceding night were repeated. The circumſtance that now ſunk in terror the minds of Emilia and Julia, fired with new wonder that of Ferdinand, who ſeizing a light, darted through the diſcovered door, and almoſt inſtantly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared.</p>
               <p>He deſcended into the ſame wild hall he had paſſed on the preceding night. He had ſcarcely reached the bottom of the ſtair-caſe, when a feeble light gleamed acroſs the hall, and his eye caught the glimpſe of a figure retiring through the low arched door which led to the ſouth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ower. He drew his ſword and ruſhed on. A faint ſound died away along the paſſage, the windings of which prevented his ſeeing the figure he purſued. Of this, indeed, he had obtained ſo ſlight a view, that he ſcarcely knew whether it bore the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of a human form. The light quickly diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, and he heard the door that opened upon the tower ſuddenly cloſe. He reached it, and forcing it open, ſprang forward; but the place was dark and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary, and there was no appearance of any perſon having paſſed along it. He looked up the tower, and the chaſm which the ſtair-caſe exhibited, convinced him that no human being could have paſſed up. He

ſtood ſilent and amazed; examining the place with an eye of ſtrict inquiry, he perceived a door, which was partly concealed by hanging ſtairs, and which till now had eſcaped his notice. Hope invigorated curioſity, but his expectation was quickly diſappointed, for this door alſo was faſtened. He tried in vain to force it. He knocked, and a hollow ſullen ſound ran in echoes through the place, and died away at a diſtance. It was evident that beyond this door were chambers of conſiderable extent, but after long and various at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to reach them, he was obliged to deſiſt, and he quitted the tower as ignorant and more diſſatisfied than he had entered. He returned to the hall, which he now for the firſt time deliberately ſurveyed. It was a ſpacious and deſolate apartment, whoſe lofty roof roſe into arches ſupported by pillars of black marble. The ſame ſubſtance inlaid the floor, and formed the ſtair-caſe. The windows were high and gothic. An air of proud ſublimity, united with ſingular wildneſs, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acterized the place, at the extremity of which aroſe ſeveral gothic arches, whoſe dark ſhade veiled in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity the extent beyond. On the left hand appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two doors, each of which was faſtened, and on the right the grand entrance from the courts. Ferdinand determined to explore the dark receſs which terminated his view, and as he traverſed the hall, his imagination, affected by the ſurrounding ſcene, often multiplied the echoes of his footſteps into uncertain ſounds of ſtrange and fearful import.</p>
               <p>He reached the arches, and diſcovered beyond a kind of inner hall of conſiderable extent, which was cloſed at the farther end by a pai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

His blood ran cold at the ſound, but ſilence returning, and continuing unbroken, he attributed his alarm to the illuſion of fancy, which terror had impregnated.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his return in the moſt painful anxiety; and, thus diſappointed in all his endeavours to penetrate the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of theſe buildings, and fatigued with fruitleſs ſearch, he reſolved to ſuſpend farther inquiry.</p>
               <p>When he related the circumſtances of his late ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, the terror of Emilia and Julia was heightened to a degree that overcame every prudent conſideration. Their apprehenſion of the marquis's diſpleaſure, was loſt in a ſtronger feeling, and they reſolved no longer to remain in apartments which offered only terrific images to their fancy. Madame de Menon almoſt equally alarmed, and more perplexed, by this combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of ſtrange and unaccountable circumſtances, ceaſed to oppoſe their deſign. It was reſolved, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that on the following day, Madame ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the marchioneſs with ſuch particulars of the late occurrences as their purpoſe made it neceſſary ſhe ſhould know, concealing their knowledge of the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den door, and the incidents immediately dependant on it; and that Madame ſhould entreat a change of apartments.</p>
               <p>Madame accordingly waited on the marchioneſs. The marchioneſs having liſtened to the account at firſt with ſurpriſe, and afterwards with indifference, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended to reprove Madame for encouraging ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious

belief in the minds of her young charge. She concluded with ridiculing as fanciful the circumſtances related, and with refuſing, on account of the numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous viſitants at the caſtle, the requeſt preferred to her.</p>
               <p>It is true the caſtle was crowded with viſitors; the former apartments of Madame de Menon were the only ones unoccupied, and theſe were in magnificent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for the pleaſure of the marchioneſs, who was unaccuſtomed to ſacrifice her own wiſhes to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of thoſe around her. She therefore treated lightly the ſubject, which, ſeriouſly attended to, could have enda<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ered her new plan of delight.</p>
               <p>But Emilia and Julia were too ſeriouſly terrified to obey the ſcruples of delicacy, or to be eaſily repulſed. They prevailed on Ferdinand to repreſent their ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the marquis.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile Hippolitus, who had paſſed the night in a ſtate of ſleepleſs anxiety, watched with buſy impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, an opportunity of more fully diſcloſing to Julia, the paſſion which glowed in his heart. The firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in which he beheld her, had awakened in him an admiration which had ſince ripened into a ſentiment more tender. He had been prevented formally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring his paſſion by the circumſtance which ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly called him to Naples. This was the dangerous illneſs of the marquis de Lomelli, his near and much valued relation. But it was a taſk too painful to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part in ſilence, and he contrived to inform Julia of his ſentiments in the air which ſhe heard ſo ſweetly ſung beneath her window.</p>
               <p>When Hippolitus reached Naples the marquis was yet living, but expired a few days after his arrival, leaving the count heir to the ſmall poſſeſſions which remained from the extravagance of their anceſtors.</p>
               <p>The buſineſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> purpoſe of declaring his love. Here unexpected obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles awaited him. The jealous vigilance of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs, conſpired with the delicacy of Julia, to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold from him the opportunity he ſo anxiouſly ſought.</p>
               <p>When Ferdinand entered upon the ſubject of the ſouthern buildings to the marquis, he carefully avoided mentioning the hidden door. The marquis liſtened for ſome time to the relation in gloomy ſilence, but at length aſſuming an air of diſpleaſure, reprehended Ferdinand for yielding his confidence to thoſe idle alarms, which he ſaid were the ſuggeſtions of a timid imagination. "Alarms," continued he, "which will readily find admittance to the weak mind of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but which the firmer nature of man ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain. Degenerate boy! Is it thus you reward my care? Do I live to ſee my ſon the ſport of every idle tale a woman may repeat? Learn to truſt reaſon and your ſenſes, and you will then be worthy of my atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion."</p>
               <p>The marquis was retiring, and Ferdinand now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it neceſſary to declare, that he had himſelf wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed the ſounds he mentioned. "Pardon me, my lord," ſaid he, "in the late inſtance I have been juſt to your command—my ſenſes have been the only evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences I have truſted. I have heard thoſe ſounds which I can not doubt." The marquis appeared ſhocked. Ferdinand perceived the change, and urged the ſubject ſo vigorouſly, that the marquis ſuddenly aſſuming a look of grave importance, commanded him to attend him in the evenining in his cloſet.</p>
               <p>Ferdinand in paſſing from the marquis met Hippol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itus. He was pacing the gallery in much ſeeming agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but obſerving Ferdinand, he advanced to him "I am ill at heart," ſaid he, in a melancholy tone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>"You are not ignorant," ſaid he, throwing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into a chair, "of the tender ſentiments which your ſiſter Julia has inſpired. I entreat you by that ſacred friendſhip which has ſo long united us, to afford me an opportunity of pleading my paſſion. Her heart, which is ſo ſuſceptible of other impreſſions, is, I fea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, inſenſible to love. Procure me, however, the ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of certainty upon a point where the tortures of ſuſpence are ſurely the moſt intolerable."</p>
               <p>"Your penetration," replied Ferdinand, "has for once forſaken you, elſe you would now be ſpared the tortures of which you complain, for you would have diſcovered what I have long obſerved, that Julia re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards you with a partial eye."</p>
               <p>"Do not," ſaid Hippolitus, "make diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more terrible by flattery; neither ſuffer the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality of friendſhip to miſlead your judgment. Your perceptions are affected by the warmth of your feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and becauſe you think I deſerve her diſtinction, you believe I poſſeſs it. Alas! you deceive yourſelf, but not me!"</p>
               <p>"The very reverſe," replied Ferdinand; "tis you who deceive yourſelf, or rather it is the delicacy of the paſſion which animates you, and which will ever ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate againſt your clear perception of a truth in which your happineſs is ſo deeply involved. Believe me, I ſpeak not without reaſon;—ſhe loves you."</p>
               <p>At theſe words Hippolitus ſtarted from his ſeat, and claſping his hands in fervent joy, "Enchanting ſounds!" cried he, in a voice tenderly impaſſioned; "<hi>could</hi> I but believe you!—could I <hi>but</hi> believe you— this world were paradiſe!"</p>
               <p>During this exclamation, the emotions of Julia,
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:029381_0059_0FE0D28D58F0B078"/>
who ſat in her cloſet adjoining, can with difficulty be imagined. A door which opened into it from the apartment where this converſation was held, was only half cloſed. Agitated with the pleaſure this declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion excited, ſhe yet trembled with apprehenſion leſt ſhe ſhould be diſcovered. She hardly dared to breathe, much leſs to move acroſs the cloſet to the door, which opened upon the gallery, whence ſhe might probably have eſcaped unnoticed, leſt the ſound of her ſtep ſhould betray her. Compelled, therefore, to remain where ſhe was, ſhe ſat in a ſtate of fearful diſtreſs, which no colour of language can paint.</p>
               <p>"Alas!" reſumed Hippolitus, "I too eagerly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the poſſibility of what I wiſh. If you mean that I ſhould really believe you, confirm your aſſertion by ſome proof." "Readily," rejoined Ferdinand.</p>
               <p>The heart of Julia beat quick.</p>
               <p>"When you was ſo ſuddenly called to Naples upon the illneſs of the marquis Lomelli, I marked her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct well, and in that read the ſentiments of her heart. On the following morning, I obſerved in her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance a reſtleſs anxiety which I had never ſeen before. She watched the entrance of every perſon with an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger expectation, which was as often ſucceeded by evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent diſappointment. At dinner your departure was mentioned:—ſhe ſpilt the wine ſhe was carrying to her lips, and for the remainder of the day was ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and melancholy. I ſaw her ineffectual ſtruggles to conceal the oppreſſion at her heart. Since that time ſhe has ſeized every opportunity of withdrawing from company. The gaiety with which ſhe was ſo lately charmed—charmed her no longer; ſhe became penſive, retired, and I have often heard her ſinging in ſome lone ſpot, the moſt moving and tender airs. Your return produced a viſible and inſtantaneous alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation;
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:029381_0060_0FE0D2945DB28A00"/>
ſhe has now reſumed her gaiety; and the ſoft confuſion of her countenance, whenever you approach, might alone ſuffice to convince you of the truth of my aſſertion."</p>
               <p>"O! talk for ever thus!" ſighed Hippolitus. "Theſe words are ſo ſweet, ſo ſoothing to my ſoul, that I could liſten till I forgot I had a wiſh beyond them. Yes!—Ferdinand, theſe circumſtances are not to be doubted, and conviction opens upon my mind a flow of extacy I never knew till now. O! lead me to her, that I may ſpeak the ſentiments which ſwell my heart."</p>
               <p>They aroſe, when Julia, who with difficulty had ſupported herſelf, now impelled by an irreſiſtible fear of inſtant diſcovery, roſe alſo, and moved ſoftly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the gallery. The ſound of her ſtep alarmed the count, who, apprehenſive leſt his converſation had been overheard, was anxious to be ſatisfied whether any perſon was in the cloſet. He ruſhed in, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered Julia! She caught at a chair to ſupport her trembling frame; and overwhelmed with mortifying ſenſations, ſunk into it, and hid her face in her robe. Hippolitus threw himſelf at her feet, and ſeizing her hand, preſſed it to his lips in expreſſive ſilence. Some moments paſſed before the confuſion of either would ſuffer them to ſpeak. At length recovering his voice, "Can you, Madam, ſaid he, forgive this intruſion, ſo unintentional? or will it deprive me of that eſteem which I have but lately ventured to believe I poſſeſſed, and which I value more than exiſtence itſelf? O! ſpeak my pardon! Let me not believe that a ſingle accident has deſtroyed my peace for ever."—"If your peace, Sir, depends upon a knowledge of my eſteem," ſaid Julia, in a tremulous voice, "that peace is already ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure. If I wiſhed even to deny the partiality I feel, it
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:029381_0061_0FE0D299F4247ED8"/>
would now be uſeleſs; and ſince I no longer wiſh this, it would alſo be painful." Hippolitus could only weep his thanks over the hand he ſtill held. "Be ſenſible, however, of the delicacy of my ſituation," continued ſhe, riſing, "and ſuffer me to withdraw." Saying this ſhe quitted the cloſet, leaving Hippolitus overcome with this ſweet confirmation of his wiſhes, and Ferdinand not yet recovered from the painful ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe which the diſcovery of Julia had excited. He was deeply ſenſible of the confuſion he had occaſioned her, and knew that apologies would not reſtore the compoſure he had ſo cruelly yet unwarily diſturbed.</p>
               <p>Ferdinand awaited the hour appointed by the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis in impatient curioſity. The ſolemn air which the marquis aſſumed when he commanded him to attend, had deeply impreſſed his mind. As the time drew nigh, expectation increaſed, and every moment ſeemed to linger into hours. At length he repaired to the cloſet, where he did not remain long before the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis entered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The ſame chilling ſolemnity marked his manner. He locked the door of the cloſet, and ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf, addreſſed Ferdinand as follows:</p>
               <p>"I am now going to repoſe in you a confidence, which will ſeverely prove the ſtrength of your honour. But before I diſcloſe a ſecret, hitherto ſo carefully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, and now reluctantly told, you muſt ſwear to preſerve on this ſubject an eternal ſilence. If you doubt the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ntrary, you believe yourſelf capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of a ſtrict integrity— now accept the terms, and receive the ſecret I offer." Ferdinand was awed by this exordium—the impatience of curioſity was for a while ſuſpended, and he heſitated whether he ſhould
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:029381_0062_0FE0D29E8AA99188"/>
receive the ſecret upon ſuch terms. At length he ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified his conſent, and the marquis ariſing, drew his ſword from the ſcabbard.—"Here" ſaid he, offering it to Ferdinand, "ſeal your vows—ſwear by this ſacred pledge of honour never to repeat what I ſhall now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal" Ferdinand bowed upon the ſword, and raiſing his eyes to Heaven ſolemnly ſwore. The marquis then reſumed his ſeat, and proceeded.</p>
               <p>"You are not to learn that, about a century ago, this caſtle was in the poſſeſſion of Vincent, third mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis of Mazzini, my grandfather. At that time there exiſted an inveterate hatred between our family and that of della Campo. I ſhall not now revert to the origin of the animoſity, or relate the particulars of the conſequent feuds—ſuffice it to obſerve, that by the power of our family, the della Campos were unable to preſerve their former conſequence in Sicily, and they have therefore quitted it for a foreign land to live in unmoleſted ſecurity. To return to my ſubject. —My grandfather, believing his life endangered by his enemy, planted ſpies upon him. He employed ſome of the numerous banditti who ſought protection in his ſervice, and after ſome weeks paſt in waiting for an opportunity, they ſeized Henry della Campo, and brought him ſecretly to this caſtle. He was for ſome time confined in a cloſe chamber of the ſouthern build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, where he expired; by what means I ſhall forbear to mention. The plan had been ſo well conducted, and the ſecrecy ſo ſtrictly preſerved, that every endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of his family to trace the means of his diſappear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, proved ineffectual. Their conjectures, it they fell upon our family, were ſupported by no proof; and the della Campos are to this day ignorant of the mode of his death. A rumour had prevailed long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the death of my father, that the ſouthern build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:029381_0063_0FE0D2A3F0DD3760"/>
of the caſtle were haunted. I diſbelieved the fact and treated it accordingly. One night when every human being of the caſtle, except myſelf, was retire<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Ferdinand liſtened to this narrative in ſilent horror. He remembered the temerity with which he had da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Every nerve thrilled at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection; and the terrors of remembrance almoſt equalled thoſe of reality.</p>
               <p>The marquis permitted his daughters to change their apartments, but he commanded Ferdinand to tell them, that in granting their requeſt, he conſulted their eaſe only, and was himſelf by no means convinced of its propriety.

knew that innocent blood had been ſhed in the caſtle, and that the walls were ſtill the haunt of an unquiet ſpirit, which ſeemed to call aloud for retribution on the poſterity of him who had diſturbed its eternal reſt. Hippolitus perceived his dejection, and entreated that he might participate his uneaſineſs: but Ferdinand, who had hitherto been frank and ingenuous, was now inflexibly reſerved. "Forbear," ſaid he "to urge a diſcovery of what I am not permitted to reveal; this is the only point upon which I conjure you to be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and this, even to you, I can not explain." Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politus was ſurpriſed, but preſſed the ſubject no farther.</p>
               <p>Julia, though ſhe had been extremely mortified by the circumſtances attendant on the diſcovery of her ſentiments to Hippolitus, experienced, after the firſt ſhock had ſubſided, an emotion more pleaſing than painful. The late converſation had painted in ſtrong colours the attachment of her lover. His diffidence— his ſlowneſs to perceive the effect of his merit—his ſucceeding rapture, when conviction was at length forced upon his mind; and his conduct upon diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Julia, proved to her at once the delicacy and the ſtrength of his paſſion, and ſhe yielded her heart to ſenſations of pure and unmixed delight. She was rouſed from this ſtate of viſionary happineſs, by a ſummons from the marquis to attend him in the library. A circumſtance ſo unuſual ſurpriſed her, and ſhe obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with trembling curioſity. She found him pacing the room in deep thought, and ſhe had ſhut the door before he perceived her. The authoritative ſeverity in his countenance alarmed her, and prepared her for a ſubject of importance. He ſeated himſelf by her, and continued a moment ſilent. At length, ſteadily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving her, "I ſent for you, my child," ſaid he,
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:029381_0065_0FE0D2AE842399D0"/>
"to declare the honour which awaits you. The duke of Luovo has ſolicited your hand. An alliance ſo ſplendid was beyond my expectation. You will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the diſtinction with the gratitude it claims, and prepare for the celebration of the nuptials."</p>
               <p>This ſpeech fell like the dart of death upon the heart of Julia. She ſat motionleſs—ſtupified and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the power of utterance. The marquis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved her couſternation; and miſtaking its cauſe, "I acknowledge," ſaid he, "that there is ſomewhat ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt in this affair; but the joy occaſioned by a diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo unmerited on your part, ought to overcome the little feminine weakneſs you might otherwiſe indulge. Retire and compoſe yourſelf; and obſerve," continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he, in a ſtern voice, "this is no time for fineſſe." Theſe words rouſed Julia from her ſtate of horrid ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pefaction. "O! Sir," ſaid ſhe, throwing herſelf at his feet, "forbear to enforce authority upon a point where to obey you would be worſe than death; if, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, to obey you were poſſible." "Ceaſe," ſaid the marquis, "this affectation, and practiſe what becomes you." "Pardon me, my lord," ſhe replied, "my diſtreſs is, alas! unfeigned. I cannot love the duke." "Away," interrupted the marquis, "nor tempt my rage with objections thus childiſh and abſurd." "Yet hear me, my lord," ſaid Julia, tears ſwelling in her eyes, "and pity the ſufferings of a child, who never till this moment has dared to diſpute your commands."</p>
               <p>"Nor ſhall ſhe now," ſaid the marquis. "What— when wealth, honour, and diſtinction are laid at my feet, ſhall they be refuſed, becauſe a fooliſh girl—a very baby, who knows not good from evil, cries, and ſays ſhe cannot love. Let me not think of it—My juſt anger may, perhaps, out-run diſcretion, and tempt me to chaſtiſe your folly.—Attend to what I ſay—

accept the duke, or quit this caſtle for ever, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der where you will." Saying this, he burſt away, and Julia, who had hung weeping upon his knees, fell proſtrate upon the floor. The violence of the fall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted the effect of her diſtreſs, and ſhe fainted. In this ſtate ſhe remained a conſiderable time. When ſhe recovered her ſenſes, the recollection of her cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity burſt upon her mind with a force that almoſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain overwhelmed her. She at length raiſed herſelf from the ground, and moved towards her own apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but had ſcarcely reached the great gallery, when Hippolitus entered it. Her trembling limbs would no longer ſupport her;—ſhe caught at a banniſter to ſave herſelf; and Hippolitus, with all his ſpeed, was ſcarcely in time to prevent her falling. The pale diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs exhibited in her counenance terrified him, and he anxiouſly inquired concerning it. She could anſwer him only with her tears, which ſhe found it impoſſible to ſuppreſs; and gently diſengaging herſelf, tottered to her cloſet. Hippolitus followed her to the door, but deſiſted from further importunity. He preſſed her hand to his lips in tender ſilence, and withdrew ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed and alarmed.</p>
               <p>Julia, reſigning herſelf to deſpair, indulged in ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude the exceſs of her grief. A calamity, ſo dreadful as the preſent, had never before preſented itſelf to her imagination. The union propoſed would have been hateful to her, even if ſhe had no prior attachment; what then muſt have been her diſtreſs, when ſhe had given her heart to him who deſerved all her admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and returned all her affection.</p>
               <p>The duke de Luovo was of a character very ſimilar to that of the marquis. The love of power was his ruling paſſion;—with him no gentle or generous ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent meliorated the harſhneſs of authority, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:029381_0067_0FE0D2BA75CB7818"/>
it to acts of beneficence. He delighted in ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple undiſguiſed tyranny. He had been twice married, and the unfortunate women ſubjected to his power, had fallen victims to the ſlow but corroding hand of ſorrow. He had one ſon, who ſome years before had eſcaped the tyranny of his father, and had not been ſince heard of. At the late feſtival the duke had ſeen Julia; and her beauty made ſo ſtrong an impreſſion upon him, that he had been induced now to ſolicit her hand. The marquis, delighted with the proſpect of a connexion ſo flattering to his favourlie paſſion, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily granted his conſent, and immediately ſealed it with a promiſe.</p>
               <p>Julia remained for the reſt of the day ſhut up in her cloſet, where the tender efforts of Madame and Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia were exerted to ſoften her diſtreſs. Towards the cloſe of evening Ferdinand entered. Hippolitus, ſhocked at her abſence, had requeſted him to viſit her, to alleviate her affliction, and if poſſible to diſcover its cauſe. Ferdinand, who tenderly loved his ſiſter, was alarmed by the words of Hippolitus, and immediately ſought her. Her eyes were ſwelled with weeping, and her countenance was but too expreſſive of the ſtate of her mind. Ferdinand's diſtreſs, when told of his father's conduct, was ſcarcely leſs than her own. He had pleaſed himſelf with the hope of uniting the ſiſter of his heart, with the friend whom he loved. An act of cruel authority now diſſolved the fairy dream of happineſs which his fancy had formed, and deſtroyed the peace of thoſe moſt dear to him. He ſat for a long time ſilent and dejected; at length, ſtarting from his melancholy reverie, he bade Julia good night, and returned to Hippolitus, who was waiting for him with anxious impatience in the north hall.</p>
               <p>Ferdinand dreaded the effect of that deſpair, which
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:029381_0068_0FE0D2C01981F7E0"/>
the intelligence he had to communicate would produce in the mind of Hippolitus. He revolved ſome means of ſoftening the dreadful truth; but Hippolitus, quick to apprehend the evil which love taught him to fear, ſeized at once upon the reality. "Tell me all," ſaid he, in a tone of aſſumed firmneſs. "I am prepared for the worſt." Ferdinand related the decree of the marquis, and Hippolitus, ſoon ſunk into an exceſs of grief which defied, as much as it required, the powers of alleviation.</p>
               <p>Julia, at length, retired to her chamber, but the ſorrow which occupied her mind, with-held the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of ſleep. Diſtracted and reſtleſs ſhe aroſe, and gently opened the window of her apartment. The night was ſtill, and not a breath diſturbed the ſurface of the waters. The moon ſhed a mild radiance over the waves, which in gentle undulations flowed upon the ſands. The ſcene inſenſibly tranquillized her ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. A tender and pleaſing melancholy diffuſed it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf over her mind; and as ſhe muſed, ſhe heard the daſhing of diſtant oars. Preſently ſhe perceived upon the light ſurface of the ſea a ſmall boat. The ſound of the oars ceaſed, and a ſolemn ſtrain of harmony (ſuch as fancy wafts from the abodes of the bleſſed) ſtole upon the ſilence of night. A chorus of voices now ſwelled upon the air, and died away at a diſtance. In the ſtrain Julia recollected the midnight hymn to the virgin, and holy enthuſiaſm filled her heart. The chorus was repeated, accompanied by a ſolemn ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of oars. A ſigh of extacy ſtole from her boſom. Silence returned. The divine melody ſhe had heard calmed the tumult of her mind, and ſhe ſunk in ſweet repoſe.</p>
               <p>She aroſe in the morning refreſhed by light ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; but the recollection of her ſorrows ſoon returned
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:029381_0069_0FE0D2C5E38E43B0"/>
with new force, and ſickening faintneſs overcame her. In this ſituation ſhe received a meſſage from the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis to attend him inſtantly. She obeyed, and he bade her prepare to receive the duke, who that morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing purpoſed to viſit the caſtle. He commanded her to attire herſelf richly, and to welcome him with ſmiles. Julia ſubmitted in ſilence. She ſaw the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis was inflexibly reſolved, and ſhe withdrew to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge the anguiſh of her heart, and prepare for this deteſted interview.</p>
               <p>The clock had ſtruck twelve, when a flouriſh of trumpets announced the approach of the duke. The heart of Julia ſunk at the ſound, and ſhe threw her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on a ſopha overwhelmed with bitter ſenſations. Here ſhe was ſoon diſturbed by a meſſage from the marquis. She aroſe, and tenderly embracing Emilia, their tears for ſome moments flowed together. At length ſummoning all her fortitude, ſhe deſcended to the hall, where, ſhe was met by the marquis. He led her to the ſaloon in which the duke ſat, with whom having converſed a ſhort time, he withdrew. The emotion of Julia at this inſtant was beyond any thing ſhe had before ſuffered; but by a ſudden and ſtrange exertion of fortitude, which the force of deſperate ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity ſometimes affords us, but which inferior ſorrow toils after in vain, ſhe recovered her compoſure, and reſumed her natural dignity. For a moment ſhe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at herſelf, and ſhe formed the dangerous reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of throwing herſelf upon the generoſity of the duke, by acknowledging her reluctance to the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſoliciting him to withdraw his ſuit.</p>
               <p>The duke approached her with an air of proud con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion; and taking her hand placed himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide her. Having paid ſome formal and general com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments to her beauty, he proceeded to profeſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:029381_0070_0FE0D2CDC1847550"/>
her admirer. She liſtened for ſome time to his profeſſions, and when he appeared willing to hear her, ſhe addreſſed him—"I am juſtly ſenſible, my lord, of the diſtinction you offer me, and muſt lament that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful gratitude is the only ſentiment I can return. Nothing can more ſtrongly prove my confidence in your generoſity, than when I confeſs to you, that parental authority urges me to give my hand, whither my heart can not accompany it."</p>
               <p>She pauſed—the duke continued ſilent.—"'Tis you only, my lord, who can releaſe me from a ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo diſtreſſing; and to your goodneſs and juſtice I appeal, certain that neceſſity will excuſe the ſingularity of my conduct, and that I ſhall not appeal in vain."</p>
               <p>The duke was embarraſſed—a fluſh of pride over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread his countenance, and he ſeemed endeavouring to ſtifle the feelings that ſwelled his heart. "I had been prepared Madam," ſaid he, "to expect a very different reception, and had certainly no reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the duke de Luovo was likely to ſue in vain. Since, however, Madam, you acknowledge that you have already diſpoſed of your affections, I ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be very willing, if the marquis will releaſe me from our mutual engagements, to reſign you to a more favoured lover." "Pardon me, my lord," ſaid Julia, bluſhing, "ſuffer me to"—"I am not eaſily deceived, Madam," interrupted the duke,—"your conduct can be attributed only to the influence of a prior attachment; and though for ſo young a lady, ſuch a circumſtance is ſomewhat extraordinary, I have certainly no right to arraign your choice. Permit me to wiſh you a good morning." He bowed low, and quitted the room. Julia now experienced a new diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs; ſhe dreaded the reſentment of the marquis, when he ſhould be informed of her converſation with
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:029381_0071_0FE0D2D29ABCE8E0"/>

terror, and preſently afterwards a low voice called her from without, and the door was opened by Ferdinand.</p>
               <p>She ſhrieked and fainted. On recovering, ſhe found herſelf ſupported by Ferdinand and Hippolitus, who had ſtolen this moment of ſilence and ſecurity to gain admittance to her preſence. Hippolitus came to urge a propoſal, which deſpair only could have ſuggeſted. "Fly," ſaid he, "from the authority of a father who abuſes his power, and aſſert the liberty of choice, which nature aſſigned you. Let the deſperate ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my hopes plead excuſe for the apparent bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this addreſs, and let the man who exiſts but for you, be the means of ſaving you from deſtruction. Alas! Madam, you are ſilent, and perhaps I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited by this propoſal, the confidence I ſo lately flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered myſelf I poſſeſſed. If ſo, I will ſubmit to my fate in ſilence, and will to-morrow quit a ſcene which preſents only images of diſtreſs to my mind.</p>
               <p>Julia could ſpeak but with her tears. A variety of ſtrong and contending emotions ſtruggled at her breaſt, and ſuppreſſed the power of utterance. Ferdinand ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed the propoſal of the count. "It is unneceſſary," my ſiſter, ſaid he, "to point out the miſery which awaits you here. I love you too well tamely to ſuffer you to be ſacrificed to ambition, and to a paſſion ſtill more hateful. I now glory in calling Hippolitus my friend—let me ere long receive him as a brother. I can give no ſtronger teſtimony of my eſteem for his character, than in the wiſh I now expreſs. Believe me he has a heart worthy of your acceptance—a heart noble and expanſive as your own." "Ah, ceaſe," ſaid Julia, "to dwell upon a character of whoſe worth I am fully ſenſible. Your kindneſs and his merit can never be forgotten by her whoſe misfortunes you have
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:029381_0073_0FE0D2DEC91BB9E0"/>
ſo generouſly ſuffered to intereſt you." She pauſed in ſilent heſitation. A ſenſe of delicacy made her heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate upon the deciſion which her heart ſo warmly prompted. If ſhe fled with Hippolitus, ſhe would avoid one evil, and encounter another. She would eſcape the dreadful deſtiny awaiting her, but muſt, perhaps, ſully the purity of that reputation, which was dearer to her than exiſtence. In a mind like her's, exquiſitely ſuſceptible of the pride of honour, this fear was able to counteract every other conſideration and to keep her intentions in a ſtate of painful ſuſpenſe. She ſighed deeply, and continued ſilent. Hippolitus was alarmed by the calm diſtreſs which her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance exhibited. "O! Julia," ſaid he, "relieve me from this dreadful ſuſpenſe!—ſpeak to me—explain this ſilence." She looked mournfully upon him—her lips moved, but no ſounds were uttered. As he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated his queſtion, ſhe waved her hand, and ſunk back into her chair. She had not fainted, but conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſome time in a ſtate of ſtupor not leſs alarming. The importance of the preſent queſtion, operating upon her mind, already harraſſed by diſtreſs, had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a temporary ſuſpenſion of reaſon. Hippolitus hung over her in an agony not to be deſcribed, and Ferdinand vainly repeated her name. At length, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering a deep ſigh, ſhe raiſed herſelf, and like one awakened from a dream, gazed around her. Hippol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itus thanked God fervently in his heart. "Tell me but that you are well," ſaid he, "and that I may dare to hope, and we will leave you to repoſe." "My ſiſter," ſaid Ferdinand, "conſult only your own wiſhes, and leave the reſt to me. Suffer a confidence in me to diſſipate the doubts with which you are agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated." "Ferdinand," ſaid Julia, emphatically,
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:029381_0074_0FE0D2E38B3FD260"/>
"how ſhall I expreſs the gratitude your kindneſs has excited?" "Your gratitude," ſaid he, "will be beſt ſhown in conſulting your own wiſhes; for be aſſured, that whatever procures your happineſs, will moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually eſtabliſh mine. Do not ſuffer the prejudices of education to render you miſerable. Believe that a choice which involves the happineſs or miſery of your whole life, ought to be decided only by yourſelf.</p>
               <p>"Let us forbear for the preſent," ſaid Hippolitus, "to urge the ſubject. Repoſe is neceſſary for you," addreſſing Julia, "and I will not ſuffer a ſelfiſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration any longer to with-hold you from it.—Grant me but this requeſt—that at this hour to-morrow night, I may return hither to receive my doom." Julia hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſented to receive Hippolitus and Ferdinand, they quitted the cloſet. In turning into the grand gallery, they were ſurpriſed by the appearance of a light, which gleamed upon the wall that terminated their view. It ſeemed to proceed from a door which opened upon a back ſtair-caſe. They puſhed on, but it almoſt inſtantly diſappeared, and upon the ſtair-caſe all was ſtill. They then ſeparated, and retired to their apartments, ſomewhat alarmed by this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which induced them to ſuſpect that their viſit to Julia had been obſerved.</p>
               <p>Julia paſſed the night in broken ſlumbers, and anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious conſideration. On her preſent deciſion, hung the criſis of her fate. Her conſciouſneſs of the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Hippolitus over her heart, made her fear to indulge its predilection, by truſting to her own opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of its fidelity. She ſhrunk from the diſgraceful idea of an elopement, yet ſhe ſaw no means of avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, but by ruſhing upon the fate ſo dreadful to her imagination.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="unknown:029381_0075_0FE0D2E81DA31110"/>On the following night, when the inhabitants of the caſtle were retired to reſt, Hippolitus, whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation had lengthened the hours into ages, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by Ferdinand, reviſited the cloſet. Julia, who had known no interval of reſt ſince they left her, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them with much agitation. The vivid glow of health had fled her cheek, and was ſucceeded by a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid delicacy, leſs beautiful, but more intereſting. To the eager inquiries of Hippolitus, ſhe returned no anſwer, but faintly ſmiling through her tears, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him her head, and covered her face with her robe. "I receive it," cried he, "as the pledge of my happineſs;—yet—yet let your voice ratify the gift." "If the preſent conceſſion does not ſink me in your eſteem," ſaid Julia, in a low tone, "this hand is your's." "The conceſſion, my love (for by that tender name I may now call you) would, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, raiſe you in my eſteem; but ſince that has been long incapable of addition, it can only heighten my opinion of myſelf, and increaſe my gratitude to you: gratitude which I will endeavour to ſhow by an anxious care of your happineſs, and by the tender attentions of a whole life. From this bleſſed moment," conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued he, in a voice of rapture, "permit, me, in thought, to hail you as my wife. From this moment, let me baniſh every veſtige of ſorrow—let me dry thoſe tears," gently preſſing her cheek with his lips, "ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to ſpring again."—The gratitude and joy which Ferdinand expreſſed upon this occaſion, united with the tenderneſs of Hippolitus, to ſoothe the agitated ſpirits of Julia, and ſhe gradually recovered her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency.</p>
               <p>They now arranged their plan of eſcape, in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of which no time was to be loſt, ſince the nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials with the duke were to be ſolemnized on the day

after the morrow. Their ſcheme, whatever it was that ſhould be adopted, they therefore reſolved to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute on the following night. But when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from the firſt warmth of enterprize, to minu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter examination, they ſoon found the difficulties of the undertaking. The keys of the caſtle were kept by Robert, the confidential ſervant of the marquis, who every night depoſited them in an iron cheſt in his chamber. To obtain them by ſtratagem ſeemed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, and Ferdinand feared to tamper with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty of this man, who had been many years in the ſervice of the marquis. Dangerous as was the attempt, no other alternative appeared, and they were therefore compelled to reſt all their hopes upon the experiment. It was ſettled, that if the keys could be procured, Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand and Hippolitus ſhould meet Julia in the cloſet. That they ſhould convey her to the ſea ſhore, from whence a boat, which was to be kept in waiting, would carry them to the oppoſite coaſt of Calabria, where the marriage might be ſolemnized without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of interruption. But, as it was neceſſary that Ferdinand ſhould not appear in the affair, it was agreed that he ſhould return to the caſtle immediately upon the embarkation of his ſiſter. Having thus arranged this plan of operation, they ſeparated till the following night, which was to decide the fate of Hippolitus and Julia.</p>
               <p>Julia, whoſe mind was ſoothed by the fraternal kindneſs of Ferdinand, and the tender aſſurances of Hippolitus, now experienced an interval of repoſe. At the return of day ſhe awoke refreſhed, and tolerably compoſed. She ſelected the few clothes which were neceſſary, and prepared them for her journey. A ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent of generoſity juſtified her in the reſerve ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to Emilia and Madame de Menon, whoſe faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:029381_0077_0FE0D2F358443438"/>
and attachment ſhe could not doubt, but whom ſhe diſdained to involve in the diſgrace that muſt fall upon them, ſhould their knowledge of her flight be diſcovered.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the caſtle was a ſcene of confuſion. The magnificent preparations which were making for the nuptials, engaged all eyes, and buſied all hands. The marchioneſs had the direction of the whole, and the alacrity with which ſhe acquitted herſelf, teſtified how much ſhe was pleaſed with the alliance, and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated a ſuſpicion that it had not been concerted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome exertion of her influence. Thus was Julia deſigned the joint victim of ambition, and illicit love.</p>
               <p>The compoſure of Julia declined with the day, whoſe hours had crept heavily along. As the night drew on, her anxiety for the ſucceſs of Ferdinand's ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociation with Robert, increaſed to a painful degree. A variety of new emotions preſſed at her heart, and ſubdued her ſpirits. When ſhe bade Emilia good night, ſhe thought ſhe beheld her for the laſt time. The ideas of the diſtance which would ſeparate them, of the dangers ſhe was going to encounter, with a train of wild and fearful anticipations, crowded upon her mind, tears ſprang in her eyes, and it was with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty ſhe avoided betraying her emotions. Of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame too, her heart took a tender farewell. At length ſhe heard the marquis retire to his apartment, and the doors belonging to the ſeveral chambers of the gueſts ſucceſſively cloſe. She marked with trembling attention the gradual change from buſtle to quiet, till all was ſtill.</p>
               <p>She now held herſelf in readineſs to depart, at the moment in which Ferdinand and Hippolitus, for whoſe ſteps in the gallery ſhe eagerly liſtened, ſhould appear. The caſtle clock ſtruck twelve. The ſound ſeemed to
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:029381_0078_0FE0D2F93A2FE3A8"/>
ſhake the pile. Julia felt it thrill upon her heart. "I hear you," ſighed ſhe "for the laſt time." The ſtill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of death ſucceeded. She continued to liſten, but no ſound met her ear. For a conſiderable time ſhe ſat in a ſtate of anxious expectation not to be deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The clock chimed the ſucceſſive quarters, and her fear roſe to each additional ſound. At length ſhe heard it ſtrike one. Hollow was that ſound, and dreadful to her hopes, for neither Hippolitus nor Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand appeared. She grew faint with fear and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment. Her mind, which for two hours had been kept upon the ſtretch of expectation, now reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed itſelf to deſpair. She gently opened the door of her cloſet, and looked upon the gallery, but all was lonely and ſilent. It appeared that Robert had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to be acceſſary to their ſcheme, and it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that he had betrayed it to the marquis. Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with bitter reflexions, ſhe threw herſelf upon the ſopha in the firſt diſtraction of deſpair. Suddenly ſhe thought ſhe heard a noiſe in the gallery; and as ſhe ſtarted from her poſture to liſten to the ſound, the door of her cloſet was gently opened by Ferdinand. "Come, my love," ſaid he, the keys are ours, and we have not a moment to loſe; our delay has been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable, but this is no time for explanation." Julia, almoſt fainting gave her hand to Ferdinand; and Hippolitus, after ſome ſhort expreſſion of his thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, followed. They paſſed the door of Madame's chamber; and treading the gallery with ſlow and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſteps, deſcended to the hall. This they croſſed towards a door, after opening which they were to find their way through various paſſages to a remote part of the caſtle, where a private door opened upon the walls. Ferdinand carried the ſeveral keys. They faſtened the hall door after them, and proceeded through a narrow paſſage terminating in a ſtair caſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="unknown:029381_0079_0FE0D2FEA93FB528"/>They deſcended, and had hardly reached the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, when they heard a loud noiſe at the door above, and preſently the voices of ſeveral people. Julia ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly felt the ground ſhe trod on, and Ferdinand flew to unlock a door that obſtructed their way. He applied the different keys, and at length found the proper one, but the lock was ruſted and refuſed to yield. Their diſtreſs now was not to be conceived. The noiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove increaſed, and it ſeemed as if the people were forcing the door. Hippolitus and Ferdinand vainly tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to turn the key. A ſudden craſh from above con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced them that the door had yielded, when making another deſperate effort, the key broke in the lock. Trembling and exhauſted, Julia gave herſelf up for loſt. As ſhe hung upon Ferdinand, Hippolitus vainly endeavoured to ſoothe her—the noiſe ſuddenly ceaſed. They liſtened, dreading to hear the ſounds renewed; but, to their utter aſtoniſhment, the ſilence of the place remained undiſturbed. They had now time to breathe, and to conſider the poſſibility of effecting their eſcape, for from the marquis they had no mercy to hope. Hippolitus, in order to aſcertain whether the people had quitted the door above, began to aſcend the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, in which he had not gone many ſteps, when the noiſe was renewed with increaſed violence. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly retreated; and making a deſperate puſh at the door below, which obſtructed their paſſage, it ſeemed to yield, and by another effort of Ferdinand, burſt open. They had not an inſtant to loſe, for they now heard the ſteps of perſons deſcending the ſtairs. The avenue they were in opened into a kind of chamber, whence three paſſages branched, of which they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately choſe the firſt. Another door now obſtructed their paſſage, and they were compelled to wait while Ferdinand applied the keys. "Be quick," ſaid Julia,
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:029381_0080_0FE0D30261033BA0"/>
"or we are loſt. O! if this lock too is ruſted!"— "Hark! ſaid Ferdinand." They now diſcovered what apprehenſion had before prevented them from perceiving, that the ſounds of purſuit were ceaſed, and all again was ſilent. As this could happen only by the miſtake of their purſuers, in taking the wrong <hi>route,</hi> they reſolved to preſerve their advantage, by concealing the light which Ferdinand now covered with his cloak. The door was opened, and they paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on, but they were perplexed in the intricacies of the place, and wandered about, in vain endeavours to find their way. Often did they pauſe to liſten, and often did fancy give them ſounds of fearful import. At length they entered on the paſſage, which Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand knew led directly to a door that opened on the woods. Rejoiced at this certainty, they ſoon reached the ſpot which was to give them liberty.</p>
               <p>Ferdinand turned the key, the door uncloſed, and to their infinite joy diſcovered to them the grey dawn.</p>
               <p>"Now, my love," ſaid Hippolitus, "you are ſafe, and I am happy."—Immediately a loud voice from without exclaimed, "Take, villain, the reward of your perfidy!" at the ſame inſtant Hippolitus receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſword in his body, and uttering a deep ſigh, fell to the ground. Julia ſhrieked, and fainted. Ferdinand, drawing his ſword, advanced towards the aſſaſſin, upon whoſe countenance the light of his lamp then ſhone, and diſcovered to him his father! The ſword fell from his graſp, and he ſtarted back in an agony of horror. He was inſtantly ſurrounded, and ſeized by the ſervants of the marquis, while the marquis himſelf denounced vengeance upon his head, and ordered him to be thrown into a dungeon of the caſtle. At this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant the ſervants of the count, who were awaiting his arrival on the ſea ſhore, hearing the tumult, haſtened to
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:029381_0081_0FE0D308CE9229E0"/>
the ſcene, and there beheld their beloved maſter, life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and weltering in his blood. They conveyed the bleeding body, with loud lamentations, on board the veſſel which had been prepared for him, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſet ſail for Italy.</p>
               <p>Julia, on recovering her ſenſes, found herſelf in a ſmall room, of which ſhe had no remembrance, with her maid weeping over her. Recollection, when it returned, brought to her mind an energy of grief, which exceeded even all former conceptions of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Yet her miſery was heightened by the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence which ſhe now received. She learned that Hippolitus had been borne away lifeleſs by his people, that Ferdinand was confined in a dungeon by order of the marquis, and that herſelf was a priſoner in a remote room, from which, on the day after the morrow, ſhe was to be removed to the chapel of the caſtle, and there ſacrificed to the ambition of her father, and the abſurd love of the duke de Luovo.</p>
               <p>This accumulation of evil ſubdued each power of reſiſtance, and reduced Julia to a ſtate little ſhort of diſtraction. No perſon was allowed to approach her but her maid, and the ſervant who brought her food. Emilia, who, though ſhocked by Julia's apparant want of confidence, ſeverely ſympathized in her diſtreſs, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited to ſee her; but the pain of denial was ſo ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aggravated by rebuke, that ſhe dared not again to urge the requeſt.</p>
               <p>In the mean time Ferdinand, involved in the gloom of a dungeon, was reſigned to the painful recollection of the paſt, and a horrid anticipation of the future. From the reſentment of the marquis, whoſe paſſions were wild and terrible, and whoſe rank gave him an unlimited power of life and death in his own territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Ferdinand had much to fear. Yet ſelfiſh appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:029381_0082_0FE0D30E64145018"/>
ſoon yielded to a more noble ſorrow. He mourned the fate of Hippolitus, and the ſufferings of Julia. He could attribute the failure of their ſcheme only to the treachery of Robert, who had, however, met the wiſhes of Ferdinand, with ſtrong apparent ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and generous intereſt in the cauſe of Julia. On the night of the intended elopement he had conſigned the keys to Ferdinand, who, immediately on receiving them, went to the apartment of Hippolitus. There they were detained till after the clock had ſtruck one, by a low noiſe, which returned at intervals, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced them, that ſome part of the family was not yet retired to reſt. This noiſe was undoubtedly occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the people whom the marquis had employed to watch, and whoſe vigilance was too faithful to ſuffer the fugitives to eſcape. The very caution of Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand defeated its purpoſe; for it is probable, that had he attempted to quit the caſtle by the common en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, he might have eſcaped. The keys of the grand door, and thoſe of the courts, remaining in the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Robert, the marquis was certain of the intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed place of their departure; and was thus enabled to defeat their hopes at the very moment when they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulted in their ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>When the marchioneſs learned the fate of Hippoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, the reſentment of jealous paſſion, yielded to emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of pity. Revenge was ſatisfied, and ſhe could now lament the ſufferings of a youth, whoſe perſonal charms had touched her heart as much as his virtues had diſappointed her hopes. Still true to paſſion, and inacceſſible to reaſon, ſhe poured upon the defenceleſs Julia her anger for that calamity of which ſhe herſelf was the unwilling cauſe. By a dexterous adaptation of her powers, ſhe had worked upon the paſſions of the marquis, ſo as to render him relentleſs in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:029381_0083_0FE0D313D7842C10"/>
of his ambitious purpoſes, and inſatiable in reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his diſappointment. But the effects of her arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices exceeded her intention in exerting them; and when ſhe meant only to ſacrifice a rival to her love, ſhe found ſhe had given up its object to revenge.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
               <p>THE nuptial morn, ſo juſtly dreaded by Julia, and ſo impatiently awaited by the marquis, now arrived. The marriage was to be celebrated with a magnificence which demonſtrated the joy it occaſioned to the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis. The caſtle was fitted up in a ſtyle of grandeur ſuperior to any thing that had been before ſeen in it. The neighbouring nobility were invited to an entertainment which was to conclude with a ſplendid ball and ſupper, and the gates were to be thrown open to all who choſe to partake of the bounty of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis. At an early hour the duke, attended by a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous retinue, entered the caſtle. Ferdinand heard from his dungeon, where the rigour and the policy of of the marquis ſtill confined him, the loud clattering of hoofs in the court yard above, the rolling of the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage wheels, and all the tumultuous buſtle which the entrance of the duke occaſioned. He too well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood this cauſe of the uproar, and it awakened in him ſenſations reſembling thoſe which the condemned criminal feels, when his ears are aſſailed by the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſound that precede his execution. When he was able to think of himſelf, he wondered by what means the marquis would reconcile his abſence to the gueſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He however, knew too well the diſſipated character of the Sicilian nobility, to doubt, that whatever ſtory
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:029381_0084_0FE0D3170B492518"/>
ſhould be invented would be very readily believed by them; who, even if they knew the truth, would not ſuffer a diſcovery of their knowledge to interrupt the feſtivity which was offered them.</p>
               <p>The marquis and marchioneſs received the duke in the outer hall, and conducted him to the ſaloon, where he partook of the refreſhments prepared for him, and from hence retired to the chapel. The marquis now withdrew to lead Julia to the altar, and Emilia was ordered to attend at the door of the chapel, in which the prieſt and a numerous company were already aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled. The marchioneſs, a prey to the turbulence of ſucceeding paſſions, exulted in the near completion of her favourite ſcheme. A diſappointment, however was prepared for her, which would at once cruſh the triumph of her malice and her pride. The marquis, on entering the priſon of Julia, found it empty! His aſtoniſhment and indignation, upon the diſcovery, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt overpowered his reaſon. Of the ſervants of the caſtle, who were immediately ſummoned, he inquired concerning her eſcape, with a mixture of fury and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, which left them no opportunity for reply. They had, however, no information to give, but that her woman had not appeared during the whole morning. In the priſon were found the bridal habiliments which the marchioneſs herſelf had ſent on the preceding night, together with a letter addreſſed to Emilia, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the following words:</p>
               <p>"Adieu, dear Emilia; never more will you ſee your wretched ſiſter, who flies from the cruel fate now prepared for her, certain that ſhe can never meet one more dreadful.—In happineſs or miſery—in hope or in deſpair—whatever may be your ſituation—ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member me with pity and affection. Dear Emilia,
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:029381_0085_0FE0D31C75DBF2D8"/>
adieu!—You will always be the ſiſter of my heart— may you never be the partner of my misfortunes!"</p>
               <p>While the marquis was reading this letter, the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs, who ſuppoſed the delay occaſioned by ſome oppoſition from Julia, flew to the apartment. By her orders all the habitable parts of the caſtle were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored, and ſhe herſelf aſſiſted in the ſearch. At length the intelligence was communicated to the chapel, and the confuſion became univerſal. The prieſt quitted the altar, and the company returned to the ſaloon.</p>
               <p>The letter, when it was given to Emilia, excited emotions which ſhe found it impoſſible to diſguiſe, but which did not, however, protect her from a ſuſpicion that ſhe was concerned in the tranſaction, her know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of which this letter appeared intended to conceal.</p>
               <p>The marquis immediately diſpatched ſervants upon the fleeteſt horſes of his ſtables, with directions to take different routes, and to ſcour every corner of the iſland in purſuit of the fugitives. When theſe exertions had ſomewhat quieted his mind, he began to conſider by what means Julia could have effected her eſcape. She had been confined in a ſmall room in a remote part of the caſtle, to which no perſon had been admitted but her own woman, and Robert, the confidential ſervant of the marquis. Even Liſette had not been ſuffered to enter, unleſs accompanied by Robert, in whoſe room, ſince the night of the fatal diſcovery, the keys had been regularly depoſited. Without them it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible ſhe could have eſcaped: the windows of the aparment being barred and grated, and opening into an inner court, at a prodigious height from the ground. Beſides who could ſhe depend upon for protection—or whither could ſhe intend to fly for concealment?—The aſſociates of her former elopement were utterly unable to aſſiſt her even with advice. Ferdinand, himſelf a
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:029381_0086_0FE0D3228A660490"/>
priſoner, had been deprived of any means of intercourſe with her, and Hippolitus had been carried lifeleſs on board a veſſel which had immediately ſailed for Italy.</p>
               <p>Robert, to whom the key had been intruſted, was ſeverely interrogated by the marquis. He perſiſted in a ſimple and uniform declaration of his innocence; but as the marquis believed it impoſſible that Julia could have eſcaped without his knowledge, he was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered into impriſonment till he ſhould confeſs the fact.</p>
               <p>The pride of the duke was ſeverely wounded by this elopement, which proved the exceſs of Julia's averſion, and compleated the diſgraceful circumſtances of his rejection. The marquis had carefully concealed from him her prior attempt at elopement, and her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent confinement; but the truth now burſt from diſguiſe, and ſtood revealed with bitter aggravation. The duke, fired with indignation at the duplicity of the marquis, poured forth his reſentment in terms of proud and bitter invective; and the marquis, galled by recent diſappointment, was in no mood to reſtrain the impetuoſity of his nature. He retorted with acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; and the conſequence would have been ſerious, had not the friends of each party interpoſed for their preſervation. The diſputants were at length reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; it was agreed to purſue Julia with united, and indefatigable ſearch; and that whenever ſhe ſhould be found, the nuptials ſhould be ſolemnized without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther delay. With the character of the duke, this conduct was conſiſtent. His paſſions, inflamed by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment, and ſtrengthened by repulſe, now defied the power of obſtacle; and thoſe conſiderations which would have operated with a more delicate mind to overcome its original inclination, ſerved only to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the violence of his.</p>
               <p>Madame de Menon, who loved Julia with maternal
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:029381_0087_0FE0D32724A495B0"/>
affection, was an intereſted obſerver of all that paſſed at the caſtle. The cruel fate to which the marquis deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tined his daughter, ſhe had ſeverely lamented, yet ſhe could hardly rejoice to find that this had been avoided by elopement. She trembled for the future ſafety of her pupil; and her tranquillity, which was thus firſt diſturbed for the welfare of others, ſhe was not ſoon ſuffered to recover.</p>
               <p>The marchioneſs had long nouriſhed a ſecret diſlike to Madame de Menon, whoſe virtues were a ſilent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof to her vices. The contrariety of their diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, created in the marchioneſs an averſion which would have amounted to contempt, had not that dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of virtue which ſtrongly characterized the manners of Madame, compelled the former to fear what ſhe wiſhed to deſpiſe. Her conſcience whiſpered her that the diſlike was mutual; and ſhe now rejoiced in the opportunity which ſeemed to offer itſelf, of lowering the proud integrity of Madame's character. Pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, therefore, to believe that ſhe had encouraged Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand to diſobey his father's commands, and had been acceſſary to the elopement, ſhe accuſed her of theſe offences, and ſtimulated the marquis to reprehend her conduct. But the integrity of madame de Menon was not to be queſtioned with impunity. Without deign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to anſwer the imputation, ſhe deſired to reſign an office of which ſhe was no longer conſidered worthy, and to quit the caſtle immediately. This the policy of the marquis would not ſuffer; and he was compelled to make ſuch ample conceſſions to Madame, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced her for the preſent to continue at the caſtle.</p>
               <p>The news of Julia's elopement at length reached the ears of Ferdinand, whoſe joy at this event was equalled only by his ſurpriſe. He loſt, for a moment, the ſenſe of his own ſituation, and thought only of the
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:029381_0088_0FE0D144F8C59990"/>
eſcape of Julia. But his ſorrow ſoon returned with ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulated force when he recollected that Julia might then perhaps want that aſſiſtance, which his confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alone could prevent his affording her.</p>
               <p>The ſervants, who had been ſent in purſuit, returned to the caſtle without any ſatisfactory information. Week after week elapſed in fruitleſs ſearch, yet the duke was ſtrenuous in continuing the purſuit. Emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries were diſpatched to Naples, and to the ſeveral eſtates of the count Vereza, but they returned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſatisfactory information. The count had not been heard of ſince he quitted Naples for Sicily.</p>
               <p>During theſe inquiries a new ſubject of diſturbance broke out in the caſtle of Mazzina. On the night ſo fatal to the hopes of Hippolitus and Julia, when the tumult was ſubſided, and all was ſtill, a light was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by a ſervant as he paſſed by the window of the great ſtair caſe in the way to his chamber, to glimmer through the caſement before noticed in the ſouthern buildings. While he ſtood obſerving it, it vaniſhed, and preſently re-appeared. The former myſterious circumſtances relative to theſe buildings ruſhed upon his mind; and fired with wonder, he rouſed ſome of his fellow ſervants to come and behold this phenomenon.</p>
               <p>As they gazed in ſilent terror, the light diſappear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſoon after, they ſaw a ſmall door belonging to the ſouth tower open, and a figure bearing a light iſſue forth, which gliding along the caſtle walls, was quickly loſt to their view. Overcome with fear, they hurried back to their chambers, and revolved all the late wonderful occurrences. They doubted not, that this was the figure formerly ſeen by the lady Julia. The ſudden change of Madame de Menon's apartments had not paſſed unobſerved by the ſervants, but they now longer heſitated to what to attribute the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val.
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:029381_0089_0FE0D33250C32728"/>
They collected each various and uncommon cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance attendant on this part of the fabric; and, comparing them with the preſent, their ſuperſtitious fears were confirmed, and their terror heightened to ſuch a degree, that many of them reſolved to quit the ſervice of the marquis.</p>
               <p>The marquis ſurpriſed at this ſudden deſertion, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into its cauſe, and learned the truth. Shocked by this diſcovery, he yet reſolved to prevent, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible the ill effects which might be expected from a circulation of the report. To this end it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to quiet the minds of his people, and to prevent their quitting his ſervice. Having ſeverely reprehended them for the idle apprehenſion they encouraged, he told them that, to prove the fallacy of their ſurmiſes, he would lead them over that part of the caſtle which was the ſubject of their fears, and ordered them to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him at the return of night in the north hall. Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia and Madame de Menon ſurpriſed at this procedure, awaited the iſſue in ſilent expectation.</p>
               <p>The ſervants in obedience to the commands of the marquis aſſembled at night in the north hall. The air of deſolation which reigned through the ſouth buildings; and the circumſtance of their having been for ſo many years ſhut up, would naturally tend to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire awe; but to theſe people, who firmly believed them to be the haunt of an unquiet ſpirit, terror was the predominant ſentiment.</p>
               <p>The marquis now appeared with the keys of theſe buildings in his hands, and every heart thrilled with wild expectation. He ordered Robert to precede him with a torch, and the reſt of the ſervants following, he paſſed on. A pair of iron gates were unlocked, and they proceeded through a court, whoſe pavement was wildly overgrown with long graſs, to the great
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:029381_0090_0FE0D33725B964F8"/>
door of the ſouth fabric. Here they met with ſome difficulty, for the lock, which had not been turned for many years, was ruſted.</p>
               <p>During this interval, the ſilence of expectation ſealed the lips of all preſent. At length the lock yielded. That door which had not been paſſed for ſo many years, creaked heavily upon its hinges, and diſcloſed the hall of black marble which Ferdinand had formerly croſſed. "Now," cried the marquis, in a tone of irony as he entered, "expect to encounter the ghoſts of which you tell me; but if you fail to conquer them, prepare to quit my ſervice. The people who live with me, ſhall at leaſt have courage and ability ſufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend me from theſe ſpiritual attacks. All I apprehend is, that the enemy will not appear, and in this caſe your valour will go untried."</p>
               <p>No one dared to anſwer, but all followed, in ſilent fear, the marquis, who aſcended the great ſtair-caſe, and entered the gallery. "Unlock that door," ſaid he, pointing to one on the left, "and we will ſoon unhouſe theſe ghoſts." Robert applied the key, but his hand ſhook ſo violently that he could not turn it. "Here is a fellow," cried the marquis, "ſit to encounter a whole legion of ſpirits. Do you, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony, take the key, and try your valour."</p>
               <p>"Pleaſe you, my lord," replied Anthony, "I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was a good one at unlocking a door in my life, but here is Gregory will do it." "No, my lord, an' pleaſe you," ſaid Gregory, here is Richard." "Stand off," ſaid the marquis, "I will ſhame your cowardice, and do it myſelf."</p>
               <p>Saying this he turned the key, and was ruſhing on, but the door refuſed to yield; it ſhook under his hands, and ſeemed as if partially held by ſome perſon on the other ſide. The marquis was ſurpriſed, and
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:029381_0091_0FE0D33BC663B630"/>
made ſeveral efforts to move it, without effect. He then ordered his ſervants to burſt it open, but, ſhrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back with one accord, they cried "for God's ſake, my lord, go no farther; we are ſatisfied here are no ghoſts, only let us go back."</p>
               <p>"It is now then my turn to be ſatisfied," replied the marquis, and till I am, not one of you ſhall ſtir. Open me that door." "My lord!"—"Nay," ſaid the marquis, aſſuming a look of ſtern authority—"diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute not my commands, I am not to be trifled with."</p>
               <p>They now ſtepped forward, and applied their ſtrength to the door, when a loud and ſudden noiſe burſt from within, and reſounded through the hollow chambers! The men ſtarted back in a fright, and were ruſhing headlong down the ſtair-caſe, when the voice of the marquis arreſted their flight. They returned with hearts palpitating with terror, "Obſerve what I ſay," ſaid the marquis, "and behave like men. Yonder door," pointing to one at ſome diſtance, "will lead us through other rooms to this chamber—unlock it therefore, for I will know the cauſe of theſe ſounds." Shocked at this determination, the ſervants again ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated the marquis to go no farther; and to be obeyed, he was obliged to exert all his authority. The door was opened, and diſcovered a long narrow paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, into which they deſcended by a few ſteps. It led to a gallery that terminated in a back ſtair-caſe, where ſeveral doors appeared, one of which the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis uncloſed. A ſpacious chamber appeared beyond, whoſe walls decayed and diſcoloured by the damps, exhibited a melancholy proof of deſertion.</p>
               <p>They paſſed on through a long ſuite of lofty and noble apartments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which were in the ſame ruinous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. At length they came to the chamber whence the noiſe had iſſued. "Go firſt Robert, with the
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:029381_0092_0FE0D342A81707F0"/>
light," ſaid the marquis, as they approached the door, "this is the key." Robert trembled—but obeyed, and the other ſervants followed in ſilence. They ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped a moment at the door to liſten, but all was ſtill within. The door was opened, and diſcloſed a large vaulted chamber, nearly reſembling thoſe they had paſſed, and on looking round, they diſcovered at once the cauſe of the alarm.—A part of the decayed roof was fallen in, and the ſtones and rubbiſh of the ruin falling againſt the gallery door, obſtructed the paſſage. It was evident, too, whence the noiſe which occaſioned their terror had ariſen; the looſe ſtones which were piled againſt the door being ſhook by the effort made to open it, had given way, and rolled to the floor.</p>
               <p>After ſurveying the place, they returned to the back ſtairs, which they deſcended, and having purſued the ſeveral windings of a long paſſage, found themſelves again in the marble hall. "Now," ſaid the marquis, "what think ye?—What evil ſpirits infeſt theſe walls? Henceforth be cautious how ye credit the phantaſms of idleneſs, for ye may not always meet with a maſter who will condeſcend to undeceive ye." They acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the goodneſs of the marquis, and profeſſing themſelves perfectly conſcious of the error of their former ſuſpicions, deſire they might ſearch no farther. "I chooſe to leave nothing to your imagination," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the marquis, leſt hereafter it ſhould betray you into a ſimilar error. Follow me, therefore; you ſhall ſee the whole of theſe buildings." Saying this he led them to the ſouth tower. They remembered, that from a door of this tower, the figure which cauſed their alarm had iſſued; and notwithſtanding the late aſſertion of their ſuſpicions being removed, fear ſtill operated powerfully upon their minds, and they would willingly have been excuſed from farther reſearch.
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:029381_0093_0FE0D34868B04668"/>
"Would any of you chooſe to explore this tower?" ſaid the marquis, pointing to the broken ſtair-caſe; "for myſelf I am mortal, and therefore fear to venture, but you who hold communion with diſembodied ſpirits, may partake ſomething of their nature, if ſo, you may paſs without apprehenſion where the ghoſt has probably paſſed before." They ſhrunk at this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, and were ſilent.</p>
               <p>The marquis, turning to a door on his right hand, ordered it to be unlocked. It opened upon the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and the ſervants knew it to be the ſame whence the figure had appeared. Having re-locked it, "Lift that trap-door, we will deſcend into the vaults," ſaid the marquis. "What trap-door, my lord?" ſaid Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, with encreaſed agitation, "I ſee none." The marquis pointed, and Robert perceived a door which lay almoſt concealed beneath the ſtone<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> that had fallen from the ſtair caſe above. He began to remove them, when the marquis ſuddenly turning, "I have already ſufficiently indulged your folly," ſaid he "and am weary of this buſineſs. If you are capable of receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conviction from truth, you muſt now be convinced that theſe buildings are not the haunt of a ſuper-natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al being; and if you are incapable, it would be entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſeleſs to proceed. You, Robert, may therefore ſpare yourſelf the trouble of removing the rubbiſh; we will quit this part of the fabric."</p>
               <p>The ſervants joyfully obeyed, and the marquis lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſeveral doors, returned with the keys to the habitable part of the caſtle.</p>
               <p>Every inquiry after Julia had hitherto proved fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and the imperious nature of the marquis, height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by the preſent vexation, became intolerably op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive to all around him. As the hope of recovering Julia declined, his opinion that Emilia had aſſiſted her
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:029381_0094_0FE0D34C606F11F0"/>
to eſcape ſtrengthened, and he inflicted upon her the ſeverity of his unjuſt ſuſpicions. She was ordered to confine herſelf to her apartment till her innocence ſhould be cleared, or her ſiſter diſcovered. From Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame de Menon ſhe received a faithful ſympathy, which was the ſole relief of her oppreſſed heart. Her anxiety concerning Julia daily encreaſed, and was heightened into the moſt terrifying apprehenſion for her ſafety. She knew of no perſon in whom her ſiſter could confide, or of any place where ſhe could find pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection; the moſt deplorable evils were therefore to be expected.</p>
               <p>One day as ſhe was ſitting at the window of her apartment, engaged in melancholy reflexion, ſhe ſaw a man riding towards the caſtle on full ſpeed. Her heart beat with fear and expectation, for his haſte made her ſuſpect he brought intelligence of Julia, and ſhe could ſcarcely refrain from breaking through the command of the marquis, and ruſhing into the hall to learn ſomething of his errand. She was right in her conjecture; the perſon ſhe had ſeen was a ſpy of the marquis's, and came to inform him that the lady Julia was at the time concealed in a cottage of the foreſt of Marentino. The marquis rejoiced at this intelligence, and gave the man a liberal reward. He learned alſo, that ſhe was accompanied by a young cavalier, which circumſtance ſurpriſed him exceedingly, for he knew of no perſon except the count de Vereza with whom ſhe could have entruſted herſelf, and the count had fallen by his ſword! He immediately ordered a party of his people to accompany the meſſenger to the foreſt of Marentino, and to ſuffer neither Julia nor the cavalier to eſcape them on pain of death.</p>
               <p>When the duke de Luovo was informed of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, he entreated and obtained permiſſion of the
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:029381_0095_0FE0D351CF2E0838"/>
marquis to join in the purſuit. He immediately ſet out on the expedition, armed, and followed by a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his ſervants. He reſolved to encounter all ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards, and to practiſe the moſt deſperate extremes ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than fail in the object of his enterpriſe. In a ſhort time he overtook the marquis's people, and they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded together with all poſſible ſpeed. The foreſt lay ſeveral leagues diſtant from the caſtle of Mazzini, and the day was cloſing when they entered upon the borders. The thick foliage of the trees ſpread a deeper ſhade around, and they were obliged to proceed with caution. Darkneſs had long fallen upon the earth when they reached the cottage, to which they were directed by a light that glimmered from afar among the trees. The duke left his people at ſome diſtance; and diſmounting, and accompanied only by one ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, approached the cottage. When he reached it he ſtopped, and looking through the window obſerved a man and woman in the habit of peaſants ſeated at their ſupper. They were converſing with earneſtneſs, and the duke, hoping to obtain farther intelligence of Julia, endeavoured to liſten to their diſcourſe. They were praiſing the beauty of a lady whom the duke did no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> doubt to be Julia, and the woman ſpoke much in praiſe of the cavalier. "He has a noble heart," ſaid ſhe, "and I am ſure by his look belongs to ſome great family." "Nay," replied her companion, "the lady is as good as he. I have been at Palermo, and ought to know what great folks are, and if ſhe is not one of them, never take my word again. Poor thing, how ſhe d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s take on! It made my heart ach to ſee her."</p>
               <p>They were ſome time ſilent. The duke knocked at the door, and inquired of the man who opened it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the lady and cavalier then in his cottage. He was aſſured there were no other perſons in the cottage
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:029381_0096_0FE0D357433A56F8"/>
than thoſe he then ſaw. The duke perſiſted in affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the perſons he inquired for were there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, which the man being as reſolute in denying, he gave the ſignal, and his people approached, and ſurrounded the cottage. The peaſants, terrified by this circumſtance, confeſſed that a lady and cavalier, ſuch as the duke deſcribed, had been for ſome time concealed in the cottage, but that they were now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.</p>
               <p>Suſpicious of the truth of the latter aſſertion, the duke ordered his people to ſearch the cottage, and that part of the foreſt contiguous to it. The ſearch ended in diſappointment. The duke, however, reſolved to obtain all poſſible information concerning the fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; and aſſuming, therefore, a ſtern air, bade the peaſant, on pain of inſtant death, diſcover all he knew of them.</p>
               <p>The man replied, that on a very dark and ſtormy night, about a week before, two perſons had come to the cottage, and deſired ſhelter. That they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attended, but ſeemed to be perſons of conſequence in diſguiſe. That they paid very liberally for what they had, and that they departed from the cottage a few hours before the arrival of the duke.</p>
               <p>The duke inquired concerning the courſe they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and having received information, re-mounted his horſe, and ſet forward in purſuit. The road lay for ſeveral leagues through the foreſt, and the darkneſs, and the probability of encountering banditti, made the journey dangerous. About the break of day, they quitted the foreſt, and entered upon a wild and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous country, in which they travelled ſome miles without perceiving a hut, or a human being. No veſtige of cultivation appeared, and no ſounds reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them but thoſe of their horſes feet, and the roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:029381_0097_0FE0D35D841C3F00"/>
of the winds through the deep foreſts that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hung the mountains. The purſuit was uncertain, but the duke reſolved to perſevere.</p>
               <p>They came at length to a cottage, where he repeated his inquiries, and learned to his ſatisfaction that two perſons, ſuch as he deſcribed, had ſtopped there for refreſhment about two hours before. He found it now neceſſary to ſtop for the ſame purpoſe. Bread and milk, the only proviſions of the place, were ſet before him, and his attendants would have been well contented had there been ſufficient of this homely fare to have ſatisfied their hunger.</p>
               <p>Having diſpatched an haſty meal, they again ſet forward in the way pointed out to them as the route of the fugitives. The country aſſumed a more civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ized aſpect. Corn, vineyards, olives, and groves of mulberry trees adorned the hills. The vallies, luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riant in ſhade, were frequently embelliſhed by the windings of a lucid ſtream, and diverſified by cluſters of half-ſeen cottages. Here the riſing turrets of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery appeared above the thick trees with which they were ſurrounded; and there the ſavage wilds, the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers had paſſed, formed a bold and pictureſque back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground to the ſcene.</p>
               <p>To the queſtions put by the duke to the ſeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons he met, he received anſwers that encouraged him to proceed. At noon he halted at a village to refreſh himſelf and his people. He could gain no intelligence of Julia, and was perplexed which way to chooſe; but determined at length to purſue the road he was then in, and accordingly again ſet forward. He travelled ſeveral miles without meeting any perſon who could give the neceſſary information, and began to deſpair of ſucceſs. The lengthened ſhadows of the mountains, and the fading light gave ſignals of declining day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="99" facs="unknown:029381_0098_0FE0D362FAF9DEB0"/>
when having gained the ſummit of a high hill, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved two perſons travelling on horſe-back in the plains below. On one of them he diſtinguiſhed the habiliments of a woman; and in her air he thought he diſcovered that of Julia. While he ſtood attentively ſurveying them, they looked towards the hill, when, as if urged by a ſudden impulſe of terror, they ſet off on full ſpeed over the plains. The duke had no doubt but that theſe were the perſons he ſought; and he, therefore, ordered ſome of his people to purſue them, and puſhed his horſe into a full gallop. Before he reached the plains, the fugitives, winding round an abrupt hill, were loſt to his view. The duke conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued his courſe, and his people, who were a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable way before him, at length reached the hill, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind which the two perſons had diſappeared. No traces of them were to be ſeen, and they entered a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row defile between two ranges of high, and ſavage mountains; on the right of which a rapid ſtream rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led along, and broke with its deep reſounding murmurs the ſolemn ſilence of the place. The ſhades of even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now fell thick, and the ſcene was ſoon enveloped in darkneſs; but to the duke, who was animated by a ſtrong and impetuous paſſion, theſe were unimport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant circumſtances. Although he knew that the wilds of Sicily were frequently infeſted with banditti, his numbers made him fearleſs of attack. Not ſo his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants, many of whom, as the darkneſs increaſed, teſtified emotions not very honourable to their courage; ſtarting at every buſh, and believing it concealed a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer. They endeavoured to diſſuade the duke from proceeding, expreſſing uncertainty of their being in the right route, and recommending the open plains. But the duke, whoſe eye had been vigilant to mark the flight of the fugitives, and who was not to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:029381_0099_0FE0D57B74D694B0"/>
from his purpoſe, quickly repreſſed their argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. They continued their courſe without meeting a ſingle perſon.</p>
               <p>The moon now roſe, and afforded them a ſhadowy imperfect view of the ſurrounding objects. The proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect was gloomy and vaſt, and not a human habitation met their eyes. They had now loſt every trace of the fugitives, and found themſelves bewildered in a wild and ſavage country. Their only remaining care was to extricate themſelves from ſo forlorn a ſituation, and they liſtened at every ſtep with anxious attention, for ſome ſound that might diſcover to them the haunts of men. They liſtened in vain; the ſtillneſs of night was undiſturbed but by the wind, which broke at intervals in low and hollow murmurs from among the mountains.</p>
               <p>As they proceeded with ſilent caution, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a light break from among the rocks at ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. The duke heſitated whether to approach, ſince it might probably proceed from a party of the banditti with which theſe mountains were ſaid to be infeſted. While he heſitated, it diſappeared; but he had not advanced many ſteps when it returned. He now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it iſſue from the mouth of a cavern, and caſt a bright reflexion upon the overhanging rocks and ſhrubs.</p>
               <p>He diſmounted, and followed by two of his people, leaving the reſt at ſome diſtance, moved with ſlow and ſilent ſteps towards the cave. As he drew near he heard the ſound of many voices in high carouſal. Sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly the uproar ceaſed, and the following words were ſung by a clear and manly voice:

The countenances of the men exhibited a ſtrange mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of fierceneſs and ſociality; and the duke could almoſt have imagined he beheld in theſe robbere a band of the early Romans before knowledge had civilized, or luxury had ſoftened them. But he had not much time for meditation—a ſenſe of his danger bade him fly, while to fly was yet in his power.</p>
               <p>As he turned to depart, he obſerved two ſaddle horſes grazing upon the herbage near the mouth of the cave. It inſtantly occurred to him that they belonged to Julia, and her companion. He heſitated, and at length determined to linger awhile, and liſten to the converſation of the robbers, hoping from thence to

have his doubts reſolved. They talked for ſome time in a ſtrain of high coviviality, and recounted in exulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion many of their exploits. They deſcribed alſo the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of ſeveral people whom they had robbed, with highly ludicrous alluſions, and with much rude humour; while the cave re-echoed with loud burſts of laughter and applauſe. They were thus engaged in tumultuous merriment, till one of them curſing the ſcanty plunder of their late adventure, but praiſing the beauty of a lady, they all lowered their voices together, and ſeemed as if debating upon a point uncommonly inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting to them. The paſſions of the duke were rouſed, and he became certain that it was Julia of whom they had ſpoken. In the firſt impulſe of feeling, he drew his ſword; but recollecting the number of his adverſaries, reſtrained his fury. He was returning from the cave, with a deſign of ſummoning his people, when the light of the fire glittering upon the bright blade of his weapon, caught the eye of one of the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditti. He ſtarted from his ſeat, and his comrades in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly riſing in conſternation, diſcovered the duke. They ruſhed with loud vociferation towards the mouth of the cave. He endeavoured to eſcape to his people; but two of the banditti mounting the horſes which were grazing near, quickly overtook and ſeized him. His dreſs and air proclaimed him to be a perſon of diſtinction, and rejoicing in their proſpect of plunder, they forced him towards the cave. Here their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades awaited them, but what were the emotions of the duke, when he diſcovered in the perſon of the principal robber, his own ſon! who to eſcape the gall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeverity of his father, had fled from his caſtle ſome years before, and had not been heard of ſince.</p>
               <p>He had placed himſelf at the head of a party of
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:029381_0102_0FE0D3781524F6C0"/>
banditti, and pleaſed with the liberty which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>en he had never taſted, and with the power which his new ſituation afforded him, he became ſo much at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to this wild and lawleſs mode of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that he determined never to quit it till death ſhould diſſolve thoſe ties which now made his rank only oppreſſive. This event ſeemed at ſo great a diſtance, that he ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom allowed himſelf to think of it. Whenever it ſhould happen, he had no doubt that he might either reſume his rank without danger of diſcovery, or might juſtify his preſent conduct as a frolick which a few acts of generoſity would eaſily excuſe. He knew his power would then place him beyond the reach of cenſure, in a country where the people are accuſtomed to implicit ſubordination, and ſeldom dare to ſcrutinize the actions of the nobility.</p>
               <p>His ſenſations, however, on diſcovering his father, were not very pleaſing; but proclaiming the duke, he protected him from farther outrage.</p>
               <p>With the duke, whoſe heart was a ſtranger to the ſofter affections, indignation uſurped the place of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rental feeling. His pride was the only paſſion affected by the diſcovery; and he had the raſhneſs to expreſs the indignation, which the conduct of his ſon had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, in terms of unreſtrained invective. The ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditti, inflamed by the opprobrium with which he loaded their order, threatened inſtant puniſhment to his te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merity; and the authority of Riccardo could hardly reſtrain them within the limits of forbearance.</p>
               <p>The menaces, and at length entreaties, of the duke, to prevail with his ſon to abandon his preſent way of life, were equally ineffectual. Secure in his own power, Riccardo laughed at the firſt, and was inſenſible to the latter; and his father was compelled to relinquiſh the attempt. The duke, however, boldly and paſſionately

                  </gap>d the fact, which ſo much exaſperated the duke, that he drew his ſword with an intention of plunging it in the breaſt of his ſon. His arm was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted by the ſurrounding banditti, who half unſheathed their ſwords, and ſtood ſuſpended in an attitude of menace. The fate of the father now hung upon the voice of the ſon. Riccardo raiſed his arm, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly dropped it, and turned away. The banditti ſheathed their weapons, and ſtepped back.</p>
               <p>Riccardo ſolemnly ſwearing that he knew nothing of the perſons deſcribed, the duke at length became convinced of the truth of the aſſertion, and departing from the cave, rejoined his people. All the impetuous paſſions of his nature were rouſed and inflamed by the diſcovery of his ſon, in a ſituation ſo wretchedly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful. Yet it was his pride rather than his virtue that was hurt; and when he wiſhed him dead, it was rather to ſave himſelf from diſgrace, than his ſon from the real indignity of vice. He had no means of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming him; to have attempted it by force, would have been at this time the exceſs of temerity, for his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants, though numerous, were undiſciplined, and would have fallen certain victims to the power of a ſavage and dexterous banditti.</p>
               <p>With thoughts agitated in fierce and agonizing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, he purſued his journey; and having loſt all trace of Julia, ſought only for an habitation which might ſhelter him from the night, and afford neceſſary refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for himſelf and his people. With this, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, there appeared little hope of meeting.</p>

                  </gap>nds ſwept over the mountains, and blew bleak and cold around; the clouds were driven ſwiftly over the face of the moon, and the duke and his people were frequently involved in total darkneſs. They had travelled on ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently and dejectedly for ſome hours, and were bewil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in the wilds, when they ſuddenly heard the bell of a monaſtery chiming for midnight prayer. Their hearts revived at the ſound, which they endeavoured to follow, but they had not gone far, when the gale waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it away, and they were abandoned to the uncertain guide of their own conjectures.</p>
               <p>They had purſued for ſome time the way which they judged led to the monaſtery, when the note of the bell returned upon the wind, and diſcovered to them that they had miſtaken their route. After much wandering and difficulty they arrived, overcome with wearineſs, at the gates of a large and gloomy fabric. The bell had ceaſed and all was ſtill. By the moon-light, which through broken clouds clouds now ſtreamed upon the building, they became convinced it was the monaſtery they had ſought, and the duke himſelf ſtruck loudly upon the gate.</p>
               <p>Several minutes elapſed, no perſon appeared, and he repeated the ſtroke. A ſtep was preſently heard with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, the gate was unbarred, and a thin ſhivering figure preſented itſelf. The duke ſolicited admiſſion, but was refuſed, and reprimanded for diſturbing the convent at the hour ſacred to prayer. He then made known his rank, and bade the friar inform the Superior that he requeſted ſhelter from the night. The friar, ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious

It was his intention to preſent himſelf to the Superior, and he had not proceeded far when the ſound of laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and of many voices in loud and mirthful jollity, attracted his ſteps. It led him through ſeveral paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages to a door, through the crevices of which light appeared. He pauſed a moment, and heard within a wild uproar of merriment and ſong. He was ſtruck with aſtoniſhment, and could ſcarcely credit his ſenſes!</p>
               <p>He uncloſed the door, and beheld in a large room, well lighted, a company of friars, dreſt in the habit of their order, placed round a table, which was profuſely ſpread with wines and fruits. The Superior, whoſe habit diſtinguiſhed him from his aſſociates, appeared at the head of the table. He was lifting a large gob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let of wine to his lips, and was roaring out, "Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and confuſion," at the moment when the duke entered. His appearance cauſed a general alarm; that part of the company who were not too much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicated, aroſe from their ſeats; and the Superior, dropping the goblet from his hands, endeavoured to aſſume a look of auſte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ty, which his roſy countenance belied. The duke received a reprimand, delivered in the liſping accents of ixtoxication, and embelliſhed with frequent interjections of hiccup. He made known his quality, his diſtreſs, and ſolicited a night's lodging for himſelf and his people. When the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior underſtood the diſtinction of his gueſt, his fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures relaxed into a ſmile of joyous welcome; and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him by the hand, he placed him by his ſide.</p>
               <p>The table was quickly covered with luxurious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, and orders were given that the duke's people

                  </gap>e retired to the apartment allotted him, leaving the Superior in a condition which precluded all ceremony.</p>
               <p>He departed in the morning, very well pleaſed with the accommodating principles of monaſtic religion. He had been told that the enjoyment of the good things of this life was the ſureſt ſign of our gratitude to Heaven; and it appeared, that within the walls of a Sicilian monaſtery, the precept and the practice were equally enforced.</p>
               <p>He was now at a loſs what courſe to chooſe, for he had no clue to direct him towards the object of his purſuit; but hope ſtill invigorated, and urged him to perſeverance. He was not many leagues from the coaſt; and it occurred to him, that the fugitives might make towards it with a deſign of eſcaping into Italy. He therefore determined to travel towards the ſea, and proceed along the ſhore.</p>
               <p>At the houſe where he ſtopped to dine, he learned that two perſons, ſuch as he deſcribed, had halted there about an hour before his arrival, and had ſet off again in much ſeeming haſte. They had taken the road towards the coaſt, where it was obvious to the duke they deſigned to embark<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He ſtayed not to finiſh the repaſt ſet before him, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>To the inquiries he made of the perſons he chanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to meet, favourable anſwers were returned for a time, but he was at length bewildered in uncertainty, and travelled for ſome hours in a direction which chance, rather than judgment, prompted him to take.</p>
               <p>The falling evening again confuſed his proſpects, and unſettled his hopes. The ſhades were deepened
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:029381_0107_0FE0D3951D1A7468"/>
by thick and heavy clouds that enveloped the horizon, and the deep ſounding air foretold a tempeſt. The thunder now rolled at a diſtance, and the accumulated clouds grew darker. The duke and his people were on a wild and dreary heath, round which they looked in vain for ſhelter, the view being terminated on all ſides by the ſame deſolate ſcene. They rode, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, as hard as their horſes would carry them; and at length one of the attendants eſpied on the ſkirts of the waſte a large manſion, towards which they immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly directed their courſe.</p>
               <p>They were overtaken by the ſtorm, and at the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when they reached the building, a peal of thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which ſeemed to ſhake the pile, burſt over their heads. They now found themſelves in a large and ancient manſion, which ſeemed totally deſerted, and was falling to decay. The edifice was diſtinguiſhed by an air of magnificence, which ill accorded with the ſurrounding ſcenery, and which excited ſome degree of ſurpriſe in the mind of the duke, who, however fully juſtified the owner in forſaking a ſpot, which preſented to the eye only views of rude and deſolated nature.</p>
               <p>The ſtorm encreaſed with much violence, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened to detain the duke a priſoner in his preſent habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for the night. The hall, of which he and his people had taken poſſeſſion, exhibited in every feature marks of ruin and deſolation. The marble pavement was in many places broken, the walls were mouldering into decay, and round the high and ſhattered windows <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he long graſs waved to the lonely gale. Curioſity led him to explore the receſſes of the manſion. He quitted the hall, and entered upon a paſſage which conducted him to a remote part of the edifice. He wandered through the wild and ſpacious apartments in gloomy meditation, and often pauſed in wonder at the remains of magnificence which he beheld.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="unknown:029381_0108_0FE0D39968B89368"/>The manſion was irregular and vaſt, and he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wildered in its intricacies. In endeavouring to find his way back, he only perplexed himſelf more, till at length he arrived at a door, which he believed led into the hall he firſt quitted. On opening it, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by the faint light of the moon, a large place, which he ſcarcely knew whether to think a cloiſter, a chapel, or a hall. It retired in long perſpective, in arches, and terminated in a large iron gate, through which appeared the open country.</p>
               <p>The lightnings flaſhed thick and blue around, which together with the thunder, that ſeemed to rend the wide arch of Heaven, and the melancholy aſpect of the place, ſo awed the duke, that he involuntarily called to his people. His voice was anſwered only by the deep echoes which ran in murmurs through the place, and died away at diſtance; and the moon now ſinking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind a cloud, left him in total darkneſs.</p>
               <p>He repeated the call more loudly, and at length heard the approach of footſteps. A few moments re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved him from his anxiety, for his people appeared. The ſtorm was yet loud, and the heavy and ſulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous appearance of the atmoſphere promiſed no ſpeedy abatement of it. The duke endeavoured to reconcile himſelf to paſs the night in his preſent ſituation, and ordered a fire to be lighted in the place he was in. This with much difficulty was accompliſhed. He then threw himſelf on the pavement before it, and tried to endure the abſtinence which he had ſo ill ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the monaſtery on the preceding night. But to his great joy his attendants, more provident than himſelf, had not ſcrupled to accept a comfortable quantity of proviſions which had been offered them at the monaſtery; and which they now drew forth from a wallet. They were ſpread upon the pavement; and
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:029381_0109_0FE0D39ED21A6258"/>
the duke, after refreſhing himſelf, delivered up the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remains to his people. Having ordered them to watch by turns at the gate, he wrap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The night paſſed without any diſturbance. The morning aroſe freſh and bright; the Heavens exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a clear and unclouded concave; even the wild heath, refreſhed by the late rains, ſmiled around, and ſent up with the morning gale a ſtream of fragrance.</p>
               <p>The duke quitted the manſion, reanimated by the cheerfulneſs of morn, and purſued his journey. He could gain no intelligence of the fugitives. About noon he found himſelf in a beautifully romantic coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and having reached the ſummit of ſome wild cliffs, he reſted to view the pictureſque imagery of the ſcene below. A ſhadowy ſequeſtered dell appeared buried deep among the rocks, and in the bottom was ſeen a lake, whoſe clear boſom reflected the impending cliffs, and the beautiful luxuriance of the overhanging ſhades.</p>
               <p>But his attention was quickly called from the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of inanimate nature, to objects more intereſting; for he obſerved two perſons, whom he inſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected to be the ſame that he had formerly purſued over the plains. They were ſeated on the margin of the lake, under the ſhade of ſome high trees at the foot of the rocks, and ſeemed partaking of a repaſt which was ſpread upon the graſs. Two horſes were grazing near. In the lady the duke ſaw the very air and ſhape of Julia, and his heart bounded at the ſight. They were ſeated with their backs to the cliffs upon which the duke ſtood, and he therefore ſurveyed them unobſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. They were now almoſt within his power, but the difficulty was how to deſcend the rocks, whoſe ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous heights, and craggy ſteeps ſeemed to render
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:029381_0110_0FE0D3A7728987D0"/>
them imputable. He examined them with a ſcruti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing eye, and at length eſpied, where the rock re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He diſmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſome of his attendants doing the ſame, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their lord down the cliffs, treading lightly, leſt their ſteps ſhould betray them. Immediately upon their reaching the bottom, they were perceived by the lady, who fled among the rocks, and was preſently purſued by the duke's people. The cavalier had no time to eſcape, but drew his ſword, and defended him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt the furious aſſault of the duke.</p>
               <p>The combat was ſuſtained with much vigour and dexterity on both ſides for ſome minutes, when the duke received the point of his adverſary's ſword, and fell. The cavalier, endeavouring to eſcape, was ſeized by the duke's people, who now appeared with the fair fugitive;—but what was the diſappointment—the rage of the duke, when in the perſon of the lady he diſcovered a ſtranger! The aſtoniſhment was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

In the duke, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſhment was heightened by vexation, and embitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by diſappointment:— in the lady, it was ſoftened by the joy of unexpected deliverance.</p>
               <p>This lady was the younger daughter of a Sicilian nobleman, whoſe avarice, or neceſſities, had devoted her to a convent. To avoid the threatened fate, ſhe fled with the lover to whom her affections had long been engaged, and whoſe only fault, even in the eye of her father, was inferiority of birth. They were now on their way to the coaſt, whence they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to paſs over to Italy, where the church would confirm the bonds which their hearts had already formed. There the friends of the cavalier reſided, and with them they expected to find a ſecure retreat.</p>

He was remounted on his horſe; and having diſpatched two of his people in ſearch of a houſe where he might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſome relief, he proceeded ſlowly on his return to the caſtle of Mazzini.</p>
               <p>It was not long ere he recollected a circumſtance which, in the firſt tumult of his diſappointment, had eſcaped him, but which ſo eſſentially affected the whole tenour of his hopes, as to make him again irreſolute how to proceed. He conſidered that, although theſe were the fugitives he had purſued over the plains, they might not be the ſame who had been ſecreted in the cottage, and it was therefore poſſible that Julia might have been the perſon whom they had for ſome time fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed from thence. This ſuggeſtion awakened his hopes, which were however quickly deſtroyed; for he remembered that the only perſons, who could have ſatisfied his doubts were now gone beyond the power of recall. To purſue Julia, when no traces of her flight remained, was abſurd; and he was therefore compelled to return to the marquis, as ignorant and more hopeleſs than he had left him. With much pains he reached the village which his emiſſaries had diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, where fortunately he obtained ſome medical aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance.

               <p>THE caſtle of Mazzini was ſtill the ſcene of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention and miſery. The impatience and aſtoniſhment of the marquis being daily increaſed by the lengthened abſence of the duke, he diſpatched ſervants to the foreſt of Marentino, to inquire the occaſion of this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. They returned with intelligence, that neither Julia, the duke, nor any of his people were there. He therefore concluded, that his daughter had fled the cottage upon information of the approach of the duke, who, he believed, was ſtill engaged in the purſuit.

               <p>The mind of Ferdinand was highly ſuperior to the general influence of ſuperſtition; but, in the preſent inſtance ſuch ſtrong correlative circumſtances appeared as compelled even incredulity to yield.

               <p>Peter, whoſe friendſhip was ſtronger than his cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, trembled with apprehenſion as the hour drew nigh in which the groans had been heard on the preceding night. He recounted to Ferdinand a variety of terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic circumſtances, which exiſted only in the heated ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations of his fellow ſervants, but which were ſtill admitted by them as facts. Among the reſt, he did not omit to mention the light and the figure, which had been ſeen to iſſue from the ſouth tower on the night of Julia's intended elopement; a circumſtance which he embelliſhed with innumerable aggravations of fear and wonder. He concluded with deſcribing the general conſternation it had cauſed, and the conſequent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of the marquis, who laughed at the fears of his people, yet condeſcended to quiet them by a formal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view of the buildings, whence their terror had origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated.

Peter went on, but was preſently interrupted by a hollow moan, which ſeemed to come from beneath the ground. "Bleſſed virgin!" exclaimed he: Ferdinand liſtened in awful expectation. A groan longer and more dreadful was repeated, when Peter ſtarting from his ſeat, and ſnatching up the lamp, ruſhed out of the dungeon. Ferdinand, who was left in total darkneſs, followed to the door, which the affrighted Peter had not ſtopped to faſten, but which had cloſed, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed held by a lock that could be opened only on the outſide. The ſenſations of Ferdinand, thus compelled to remain in the dungeon, are not to be imagined. The horrors of the night, whatever they were to be, he was to endure alone. By degrees, however, he ſeemed to acquire the valour of deſpair. The ſounds were repeated at intervals for near an hour, when ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence returned, and remained undiſturbed during the reſt of the night. Ferdinand was alarmed by no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance; and at length, overcome with anxiety and watching, he ſunk to repoſe.</p>
               <p>On the following morning Peter returned to the dungeon, ſcarcely knowing what to expect, yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting ſomething very ſtrange, perhaps the murder— perhaps the ſupernatural diſappearance of his young <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Full of theſe wild apprehenſions, he dared not endure thither alone, but perſuaded ſome of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, to whom he had communicated his terrors, to accompany him to the door. As they paſſed along he recollected, that in the terror of the preceding

He hurried to the door, and his ſurpriſe was extreme to find it faſtened It inſtantly ſtruck him that this was the work of a ſupernatural power; when, on calling alo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There the uproar occaſioned by their entrance called together a number of perſons, amongſt whom was the marquis, who was ſoon informed of the cauſe of alarm, with a long hiſtory of the circumſtances of the foregoing night. At this information, the marquis aſſumed a very ſtern look, and ſeverely reprimanded Peter for his impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, at the ſame time reproaching the other ſervants with their undutifulneſs in thus diſturbing his peace. He reminded them of the condeſcenſion he had prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed to diſſipate their former terrors, and of the reſult of their examination. He then aſſured them, that ſince indulgence had only encouraged intruſion, he would for the future be ſevere; and concluded with declaring, that the firſt man who ſhould diſturb him with a repetition of ſuch ridiculous apprehenſions, or ſhould attempt to diſturb the peace of the caſtle by cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating theſe idle notions, ſhould be rigorouſly pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed, and baniſhed his dominions. They ſhrunk back at this reproof, and were ſilent. "Bring a torch, ſaid the marquis, "and ſhow me to the dungeon. I will once more condeſcend to confute you."</p>
               <p>They obeyed, and deſcended with the marquis, who, arriving at the dungeon, inſtantly threw open the door,

and diſcovered to the aſtoniſhed eyes of his attendants —Ferdinand!—He ſtarted with ſurpriſe at the entrance of his father thus attended. The marquis darting upon him a ſevere look, which he perfectly comprehended— "Now," cried he, turning to his people, "what do you feel My ſon, whom I myſelf placed here, and whoſe voice, which anſwered to your calls, you have transformed into unknown ſounds. "Speak, Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand, and confirm what I ſay." Ferdinand did ſo. "What dreadful ſpectre appeared to you laſt night? Reſumed the marquis, looking ſtedfaſtly upon him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> gratify theſe fellows with a deſcription of it, for they cannot exiſt without ſomething of the marvellous." "None my lord," replied Ferdinand, who too well underſtood the manner of the marquis. "Tis well," cried the marquis, "and this is the laſt time," turning to his attendants, "that your folly ſhall be treated with ſo much lenity." He ceaſed to urge the ſubject, and forbore to aſk Ferdinand even one queſtion before his ſervants, concerning the nocturnal ſounds deſcribed by Peter. He quitted the dungeon with eyes ſteadily bent in anger and ſuſpicion upon Ferdinand. The marquis ſuſpected that the fears of his ſon had inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertently betrayed to Peter a part of the ſecret intruſted to him, and he artfully interrogated Peter with ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing careleſſneſs, concerning the circumſtances of the preceding night. From him he drew ſuch anſwers as honourably acquitted Ferdinand of indiſcretion, and relieved himſelf from tormenting apprehenſions.</p>
               <p>The following night paſſed quietly away; neither ſound nor appearance diſturbed the peace of Ferdinand. The marquis, on the next day, thought proper to ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the ſeverity of his ſufferings, and he was removed from his dungeon to a room ſtrongly grated, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the light of day.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="unknown:029381_0119_0FE0D3DE26433A20"/>Meanwhile a circumſtance occurred which increaſed the general diſcord, and threatened Emilia with the loſs of her laſt remaining comfort—the advice and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of Madame de Menon. The marchioneſs, whoſe paſſion for the count de Vereza had at length yielded to abſence, and the preſſure of preſent circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, now beſtowed her ſmiles upon a young Italian cavalier, a viſitor at the caſtle, who poſſeſſed too much of the ſpirit of gallantry to permit a lady to languiſh in vain. The marquis, whoſe mind was occupied with other paſſions, was inſenſible to the miſconduct of his wife, who at all times had the addreſs to diſguiſe her vices beneath the gloſs of virtue and innocent freedom. The intrigue was diſcovered by Madame, who, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one day left a book in the oak parlour, returned thither in ſearch of it. As ſhe opened the door of the apartment, ſhe heard the voice of the cavalier in paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate exclamation; and on entering, diſcovered him riſing in ſome confuſion from the feet of the marchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneſs, who, darting at Madame a look of ſeverity, aroſe from her ſeat. Madame, ſhocked at what ſhe had ſeen, inſtantly retired, and buried in her own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom that ſecret, the diſcovery of which would moſt eſſentially have poiſoned the peace of the marquis. The marchioneſs, who was a ſtranger to the generoſity of ſentiment which actuated Madame de Menon, doubted not that ſhe would ſeize the moment of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliation, and expoſe her conduct where moſt ſhe dreaded it ſhould be known<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The conſciouſneſs of guilt tortured her with inceſſant fear of diſcovery, and from this period her whoſe attention was employed to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodge from the caſtle, the perſon to whom her charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was committed. In this it was not difficult to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed; for the delicacy of Madame's feelings made her quick to perceive, and to withdraw from a treatment
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:029381_0120_0FE0D3E6CD63FA80"/>
unſuitable to the natural dignity of her character. She therefore reſolved to depart from the caſtle; but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining to take an advantage even over a ſucceſsful enemy, ſhe determined to be ſilent on that ſubject which would inſtantly have transferred the triumph from her adverſary to herſelf. When the marquis, on hearing her determination to retire, earneſtly inquired for the motive of her conduct ſhe forbore to acquaint him with the real one, and left him to incertitude and diſappointment.</p>
               <p>To Emilia this deſign occaſioned a diſtreſs which almoſt ſubdued the reſolution of Madame. Her tears and intreaties ſpoke the artleſs energy of ſorrow. In Madame ſhe loſt her only friend; and ſhe too well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the value of that friend, to ſee her depart without feeling and expreſſing the deepeſt diſtreſs. From a ſtrong attachment to the memory of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Madame had been induced to undertake the education of her daughters, whoſe engaging diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had perpetuated a kind of hereditary affection. Regard for Emilia and Julia had alone for ſome time detained her at the caſtle; but this was now ſucceeded by the influence of conſiderations too powerful to be reſiſted. As her income was ſmall, it was her plan to retire to her native place, which was ſituated in a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant part of the iſland, and there take up her reſidence in a convent.</p>
               <p>Emilia ſaw the time of Madame's departure approach with increaſed diſtreſs. They left each other with a mutual ſorrow, which did honour to their hearts. When her laſt friend was gone, Emilia wandered through the forſaken apartments, where ſhe had been accuſtomed to converſe with Julia, and to recieve con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation and ſympathy from her dear inſtructreſs, with a kind of anguiſh known only to thoſe who have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:029381_0121_0FE0D3EB635E61E0"/>
a ſimilar ſituation. Madame purſued her journey with a heavy heart. Separated from the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The world appeared a wild and gloomy deſert, where no heart welcomed her with kindneſs—no countenance brightened into ſmiles at her approach. It was many years ſince ſhe quitted Calini—and in the interval, death had ſwept away the few friends ſhe left there. The future preſented a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy ſcene; but ſhe had the retroſpect of years ſpent in honourable endeavour and ſtrict integrity, to cheer her heart and encourage her hopes.</p>
               <p>But her utmoſt endeavours were unable to repreſs the anxiety with which the uncertain fate of Julia overwhelmed her. Wild and terrific images aroſe to her imagination. Fancy drew the ſcene;—ſhe deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened the ſhades; and the terrific aſpect of the object ſhe preſented was heightened by the obſcurity which involved them.</p>

               <p>TOWARDS the cloſe of day Madame arrived at a ſmall village ſituated among the mountains, where ſhe purpoſed to paſs the night. The evening was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably fine, and the groteſque beauty of the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding ſcenery invited her to walk. She followed the windings of a ſtream, which was loſt at ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance among luxuriant groves of cheſnut. The rich colouring of evening glowed through the dark foliage, which ſpreading a penſive gloom around, offered a
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:029381_0122_0FE0D3F3C2C80940"/>
ſcene congenial to the preſent temper of her mind, and ſhe entered the ſhades. Her thoughts, affected by the ſurrounding objects, gradually ſunk into a pleaſing and complacent melancholy, and ſhe was inſenſibly led on. She ſtill followed the courſe of the ſtream to where the deep ſhades retired, and the ſcene again opening to day, yielded to her a view ſo various and ſublime, that ſhe pauſed in thrilling and delightful wonder. A group of wild and gro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſque rocks roſe in a ſemicircu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar form, and their fantaſtic ſhapes exhibited Nature in her moſt ſublime and ſtriking attitudes. Here her vaſt magnificence elevated the mind of the beholder with high enthuſiaſm. Fancy caught the thrilling ſenſation, and at her touch the towering ſteeps became ſhaded with unreal glooms; the caves more darkly frowned—the projecting cliffs aſſured a more terrific aſpect, and the wild overhanging ſhrubs waved to the gale in deeper murmurs. The ſcene inſpired Madame with reverential awe, and her thoughts involuntarily roſe "from Nature up to Nature's God." The laſt dying gleams of day tinted the rocks and ſhone upon the waters, which retired through a rugged channel, and were loſt afar among the receding cliffs. While ſhe liſtened to their diſtant murmur, a voice of liquid and melodious ſweetneſs aroſe from among the rocks; it ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ng an air, whoſe melancholy expreſſions awakened all her attention, and captivated her heart. The tones ſwelled and died faintly away among the clear, yet languiſhing echoes, which the rocks repeated with an effect like that of enchantment. Madame looked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round in ſearch of the ſweet warble, and obſerved at ſome diſtance a peaſant girl ſeated on a ſmall projec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the rock, overſhadowed by drooping ſycamores. She moved ſlowly towards the ſpot, which ſhe had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt reached, when the ſound of her ſteps ſtartled and
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:029381_0123_0FE0D3F85C70B360"/>
ſilenced the ſyren, who, on perceiving a ſtranger, aroſe in an attitude to depart. The voice of Madame arreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, and ſhe appproached. Language cannot paint the ſenſation of Madame, when, in the diſguiſe of a peaſant girl, ſhe diſtinguiſhed the features of Julia, whoſe eyes lighted up with ſudden recollection, and who ſunk into her arms overcome with joy. When their firſt emotions were ſubſided, and Julia had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived anſwers to her inquiries concerning Ferdinand and Emilia, ſhe led Madame to the place of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment. This was a ſolitary cottage, in a cloſe val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley ſurrounded by mountains whoſe cliffs appeared wholly inacceſſible to mortal foot. The deep ſolitude of the ſcene diſſipated at once Madame's wonder that Julia had ſo long remained undiſcovered, and excited ſurpriſe how ſhe had been able to explore a ſpot thus deeply ſequeſtered; but Madame obſerved with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme concern, that the countenance of Julia no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger wore the ſmile of health and gaiety. Her fine features had received the impreſſions not only of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, but of grief. Madame ſighed as ſhe gazed, and read too plainly the cauſe of the change. Julia underſtood that ſigh, and anſwered it with her tears. She preſſed the hand of Madame in mournful ſilence to her lips, and her cheeks were ſuffuſed with a crimſon glow. At length, recovering herſelf, "I have much, my dear Madame, to tell," ſaid ſhe, "and much to explain, 'ere you will admit me again to that eſteem of which I was once ſo juſtly proud. I had no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource from miſery, but in flight; and of that I could not make you a confidant, without meanly involving you in its diſgrace." "Say no more, my love, on the ſubject," replied Madame; "with reſpect to myſelf, I admired your conduct, and felt ſeverely for your ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation. Rather let me hear by what means you ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:029381_0124_0FE0D3FFDA60DA78"/>
your eſcape, and what has ſince befallen you." Julia pauſed a moment, as if to ſtifle her riſing emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and then commenced her narrative.</p>
               <p>"You are already acquainted with the ſecret of that night, ſo fatal to my peace. I recall the remembrance of it with an anguiſh which I cannot conceal; and why ſhould I wiſh its concealment, ſince I mourn for one, whoſe noble qualities juſtified all my admiration, and deſerved more than my feeble praiſe can beſtow: the idea of whom will be the laſt to linger in my mind till death ſhuts up this painful ſcene." Her voice trembled, and ſhe pauſed. After a few moments ſhe reſumed her tale. "I will ſpare myſelf the pain of recurring to ſcenes with which you are not unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, and proceed to thoſe which more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately attract your intereſt. Caterina, my faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, you know, attended me in my confinement; to her kindneſs I owe my eſcape. She obtained from her lover, a ſervant in the caſtle, that aſſiſtance which gave me liberty.—One night when Carlo, who had been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed my guard, was aſleep, Nicolo crept into his chamber, and ſtole from him the keys of my priſon. He had previouſly procured a ladder of ropes. O! I can never forget my emotions, when in the dead hour of that night, which was meant to precede the day of my ſacrifice, I heard the door of my priſon unlock, and found myſelf half at liberty! My trembling limbs with difficulty ſupported me as I followed Caterina to the ſaloon, the windows of which being low and near to the terrace, ſuited our purpoſe. To the terrace we eaſily got, where Nicolo awaited us with the rope lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. He faſtened it to the ground; and having climbed to the top of the parapet, quickly ſlided down on the other ſide. There he held it while we aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and deſcended; and I ſoon breathed the air of
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:029381_0125_0FE0D404748459E8"/>
freedom again. But the apprehenſion of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken was ſtill too powerful to permit a full enjoyment of my eſcape. It was my plan to proceed to the place of my faithful Caterina's nativity, where ſhe had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured me I might find a ſafe aſylum in the cottage of her parents, from whom, as they had never ſeen me, I might conceal my birth. This place, ſhe ſaid, was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely unknown to the marquis, who had hired her at Naples only a few months before, without any inquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies concerning her family. She had informed me that the village was many leagues diſtant from the caſtle, but that ſhe was very well acquainted with the road. At the foot of the walls we left Nicolo, who returned to the caſtle <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>"ABOUT a quarter of a league from the walls we ſtopped, and I aſſumed the habit in which you now ſee me. My own dreſs was faſtened to ſome heavy ſtones, and Caterina threw it into the ſtream, whoſe murmurings you have ſo often admired. The fatigue and hardſhip I endured in this journey, performed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt wholly on foot, at any other time would have overcome me; but my mind was ſo occupied by the danger I was avoiding, that theſe leſſer evils were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded. We arrived in ſafety at the cottage, which ſtood at a little diſtance from the village of Farrini and

were received by Caterina's parents, with ſome ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, and more kindneſs. I ſoon perceived it would be uſeleſs, and even dangerous, to attempt to preſerve the character I perſonated. In the eyes of Caterina's mother, I read a degree of ſurpriſe and admiration which declared ſhe believed me of ſuperior rank; I, therefore, thought it more prudent to win her fidelity by entruſting her with my ſecret than, by endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to conceal it, leave it to be diſcovered by her curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity or diſcernment. Accordingly I made known my quality and my diſtreſs, and received ſtrong aſſurances of aſſiſtance and attachment. For further ſecurity I removed to this unſuſpicious ſpot.

               <p>Here Julia cloſed her narration, to which Madame had liſtened with a mixture of ſurpriſe and pity, which her eyes ſufficiently diſcovered. The laſt circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the narrative ſeriouſly alarmed her. She acquainted Julia with the purſuit which the duke had undertaken; and ſhe did not heſitate to believe it a party of his people whom Julia had deſcribed. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, therefore, earneſtly adviſed her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Julia accepted the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal with much joy. As it was neceſſary that Madame ſhould ſleep at the village where ſhe had left her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and horſes, it was agreed that at break of day ſhe
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:029381_0127_0FE0D41084261E58"/>
ſhould return to the cottage, where Julia would await her. Madame took an affectionate leave of Julia whoſe heart, in ſpite of reaſon ſunk when ſhe ſaw her depart though but for the neceſſary interval of repoſe.</p>
               <p>At the dawn of day Madame aroſe. Her ſervants, who were hired for the journey were ſtrangers to Julia, from them, therefore, ſhe had nothing to apprehend. She reached the cottage before ſun-riſe, having left her people at ſome little diſtance. Her heart fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boded evil, when, on knocking at the door, no anſwer was returned. She knocked again, and ſtill all was ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. Through the caſement ſhe could diſcover no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, amidſt the grey obſcurity of the dawn. She now opened the door, and to her inexpreſſible aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and diſtreſs, found the cottage empty. She pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to a ſmall inner room, where lay a part of Julia's apparel.

While ſhe purſued the ſearch, ſhe ſuddenly heard the trampling of feet at the cottage door, and preſently after ſome people entered.—Her fears for Julia now yielded to thoſe for her own ſafety, and ſhe was undetermined whether to diſcover herſelf, or remain in her preſent ſituation, when ſhe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved from her irreſolution and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>On the return of the good woman, who had accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied Madame to the village on the preceding night, Julia went to the cottage at Farrini. Her grateful heart would not ſuffer her to depart without taking leave of her faithful friends, thanking them for their kindneſs, and informing them of her future pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects. They had prevailed upon her to ſpend the few intervening hours at this cot, whence ſhe had juſt riſen to meet Madame.</p>

For ſome leagues they travelled in ſilence and thought, over a wild and pictureſque country. The landſcape was tinted with rich and vari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

All the glories of the vintage roſe to their view: the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple grapes fluſhed through the dark green of the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding foliage, and the proſpect glowed with warm luxuriance.</p>
               <p>They now deſcended into a deep valley, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared more like a ſcene of airy enchantment than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality. Along the bottom flowed a clear majeſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Madame wept over her, but comfort ſhe had none to give. The day cloſed—the duke did not appear, and the fate of Julia yet hung in perilous uncertainty. At length, from a window of the apartment ſhe was in, ſhe diſtinguiſhed a glimmering of torches among the trees, and preſently after the clattering of hoofs convinced her the duke was approaching. Her heart ſunk at the ſound; and throwing her arms round Madame's neck, ſhe reſigned herſelf to deſpair. She was ſoon rouſed by ſome men, who came to announce the arrival of their lord.

Madame now ſtepped forward, and an explanation en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, when it appeared that the ſtranger was the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis Murani, the father of the fair fugitive whom the duke had before miſtaken for Julia.</p>
               <p>The appearance and evident flight of Julia, had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the banditti employed by this nobleman, into a belief that ſhe was the object of their ſearch, and had occaſioned her this unneceſſary diſtreſs.

               <p>They aroſe with the dawn, and continued their journey, continually terrified with the apprehenſion of encountering the duke's people. At noon they arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Azulia, from whence the monaſtery, or abbey of St. Auguſtin was diſtant only a few miles. Madame wrote to the <hi>Padre Abate,</hi> to whom ſhe was ſomewhat related, and ſoon after received an anſwer very favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to her wiſhes. The ſame evening they repaired to the abbey, where Julia, once more relieved from the fear of purſuit, offered up a prayer of gratitude to Heaven, and endeavoured to calm her ſorrows by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion. She was received by the abbot with a ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="133" facs="unknown:029381_0132_0FE0D433AF8033B8"/>
Comforted by theſe circumſtances, and by the tranquil appearance of every thing around her, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to reſt, and paſſed the night in peaceful ſlumbers.</p>
               <p>In her preſent ſituation ſhe found much novelty to amuſe, and much ſerious matter to engage her mind. Entendered by diſtreſs, ſhe eaſily yielded to the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive manners of her companions, and to the ſerene uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of a monaſtic life. She loved to wander through the lonely cloiſters, and high-arched aiſles, whoſe long perſpectives retired in ſimple grandeur, diffuſing a holy calm around. She found much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the converſation of the nuns, many of whom were uncommonly amiable, and the dignified ſweetneſs of whoſe manners formed a charm irreſiſtibly attrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. The ſoft melancholy impreſſed upon their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances, pourtrayed the ſituation of their minds, and excited in Julia a very intereſting mixture of pity and eſteem. The affectionate appellation of ſiſter, and all that endearing tenderneſs which they ſo well know how to diſplay, and of which they ſo well underſtand the effect, they beſtowed on Julia, in the hope of win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her to become one of their order.</p>
               <p>Soothed by the preſence of Madame, the aſſiduity of the nuns, and by the ſtillneſs and ſanctity of the place, her mind gradually recovered a degree of complacency to which it had long been a ſtranger. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all her efforts, the idea of Hippolitus would at intervals return upon her memory with a force that at once ſubdued her fortitude, and ſunk her in a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary deſpair.</p>
               <p>Among the holy ſiſters, Julia diſtinguiſhed one, the ſingular fervor of whoſe devotion, and the penſive air of whoſe countenance, ſoftened by the languor of ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, attracted her curioſity, and excited a ſtrong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of pity. The nun, by a ſort of ſympathy, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:029381_0133_0FE0D438C02AE860"/>
particularly inclined towards Julia, which ſhe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by innumerable acts of kindneſs, ſuch as the heart can quickly underſtand and acknowledge, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though deſcription can never reach them. In conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation with her, Julia endeavoured, as far as delicacy would permit, to prompt an explanation of that more than common dejection which ſhaded thoſe features, where beauty, touched by reſignation and ſublimed by religion, ſhone forth with mild and lambent luſtre.</p>
               <p>The duke de Luovo, after having been detained for ſome weeks by the fever which his wounds had produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and his irritated paſſions had much prolonged, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the caſtle of Mazzini. When the marquis ſaw him return, and recollected the futility of thoſe exertions, by which he had boaſtingly promiſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover Julia, the violence of his nature ſpurned the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe of art, and burſt forth in contemptuous impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the valour and diſcernment of the duke, who who ſoon retorted with equal fury. The conſequence might have been fatal, had not the ambition of the marquis ſubdued the ſudden irritation of his inferior paſſions, and induced him to ſoften the ſeverity of his accuſations, by ſubſequent conceſſions. The duke, whoſe paſſion for Julia was heightened by the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which oppoſed it, admitted ſuch conceſſions, as in other circumſtances he would have rejected; and thus each conquered by the predominant paſſion of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſubmitted to be the ſlave of his adverſary.</p>
               <p>Emilia was at length releaſed from the confinement ſhe had ſo unjuſtly ſuffered. She had now the uſe of her old apartments, where, ſolitary and dejected, her hours moved heavily along, embittered by inceſſant anxiety for Julia, and by regret for the loſt ſociety of Madame. The marchioneſs, whoſe pleaſures ſuffered a temporary ſuſpenſe during the preſent confuſion at

Emilia was condemned to ſuffer, and to endure without the privilege of complaining. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewing the events of the laſt few weeks, ſhe ſaw thoſe moſt dear to her baniſhed, or impriſoned by the ſecret influence of a woman, every feature of whoſe character was exactly oppoſite to that of the amiable mother ſhe had been appointed to ſucceed.</p>
               <p>The ſearch after Julia ſtill continued, and was ſtill unſucceſsful. The aſtoniſhment of the marquis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed with his diſappointments; for where could Julia, ignorant of the country, and deſtitute of friends, have poſſibly found an aſylum? He ſwore with a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible oath to revenge on her head, whenever ſhe ſhould be found, the trouble and vexation ſhe now cauſed him. But he agreed with the duke to relinquiſh for a while the ſearch; till Julia, gaining confidence from the obſervation of this circumſtance, might gradually ſuppoſe herſelf ſecure from moleſtation, and thus be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to emerge by degrees from concealment.</p>

               <p>MEANWHILE Julia, ſheltered in the obſcure receſſes of St. Auguſtin, endeavoured to attain a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of that tranquillity which ſo ſtrikingly characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized the ſcenes around her. The abbey of St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin was a large magnificent maſs of Gothic archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture, whoſe gloomy battlements, and majeſtic tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, aroſe in proud ſublimity from amid the darkneſs of the ſurrounding ſhades. It was founded in the twelfth
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:029381_0135_0FE0D44545A2F670"/>
century, and ſtood a proud monument of monkiſh ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition and princely muniſicence. In the times when Italy was agitated by internal commotions, and perſecuted by foreign invaders, this edifice afforded an aſylum to many noble Italian emigrants, who here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated the reſt of their days to religion. At their death they enriched the monaſtery with the treaſures which it had enabled them to ſecure.</p>
               <p>The view of this building revived in the mind of the beholder the memory of paſt ages. The manners and characters which diſtinguiſhed them aroſe to his fancy, and through the long lapſe of years, he diſcriminated thoſe cuſtoms and manners which formed ſo ſtriking a contraſt to the modes of his own times. The rude manners, the boiſterous paſſions, the daring ambition, and the groſs indulgences which formerly characterized the prieſt, the nobleman, and the ſovereign, had then begun to yield to learning—the charms of refined con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation—political intrigue and private artifices. Thus do the ſcenes of life vary with the predominant paſſions of mankind, and with the progreſs of civiliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The dark clouds of prejudice break away be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſun of ſcience, and gradually diſſolving, leave the brightening hemiſphere to the influence of his beams. But through the preſent ſcene appeared only a few ſcattered rays, which ſerved to ſhow more forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the vaſt and heavy maſſes that concealed the form of truth. Here prejudice, not reaſon, ſuſpended the influence of the paſſions; and ſcholaſtic learning, myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terious philoſophy, and crafty ſanctity, ſupplied the place of wiſdom, ſimplicity, and pure devotion.</p>
               <p>At the abbey, ſolitude and ſtillneſs, conſpired with the ſolemn aſpect of the pile to impreſs the mind with religious awe. The dim glaſs of the high-arched win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, ſtained with the colouring of monkiſh fictions
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:029381_0136_0FE0D44CF64C96C8"/>
and ſhaded by the thick trees that environed the abbey, ſpread around a ſacred gloom, which inſpired the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder with congenial feelings.</p>
               <p>As Julia muſed through the walks, and ſurveyed this vaſt monument of barbarous ſuperſtition, it brought to her recollection an ode which ſhe often repeated with melancholy pleaſure, as the compoſition of Hippolitus.</p>

Madame behaved to Julia with the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt attention, and endeavoured to withdraw her thoughts from their mournful ſubject, by promoting that taſte for literature and muſic, which was ſo ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the powers of her mind.</p>
               <p>But an object ſeriouſly intereſting now obtained that regard, which thoſe of mere amuſement failed to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract. Her favourite nun, for whom her love and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem daily increaſed, ſeemed declining under the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of a ſecret grief. Julia was deeply affected with her ſituation, and though ſhe was not empowered to adminiſter conſolation to her ſorrows, ſhe endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to mitigate the ſufferings of illneſs. She nurſed her with unremitting care, and ſeemed to ſeize with avidity the temporary opportunity of eſcaping from herſelf. The nun appeared perfectly reconciled to her fate, and exhibited during her illneſs, ſo much ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, patience, and reſignation, as affected all around her with pity and love. Her angelic mildneſs, and ſteady fortitude, characterized the beatification of a ſaint, rather than the death of a mortal. Julia watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every turn of her diſorder with the utmoſt ſolicitude, and her care was at length rewarded by the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Cornelia. Her health gradually improved, and ſhe attributed this circumſtance to the aſſiduity and tenderneſs of her young friend, to whom her heart now expanded in warm and unreſerved affection. At length Julia ventured to ſolicit what ſhe had ſo long and ſo earneſtly wiſhed for, and Cornelia unfolded the hiſtory of her ſorrows.</p>

               <p>"I am the unfortunate deſcendant of an ancient and illuſtrious Italian family. In early childhood I was deprived of a mother's care, but the tenderneſs of my ſurviving parent made her loſs, as to my welfare, almoſt unfelt.

The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection of his virtue elevates my mind, and fills my heart with a noble pride, which even the cold walls of a monaſtery have not been able to ſubdue.</p>
               <p>"My father's fortune was unſuitable to his rank. That his ſon might hereafter be enabled to ſupport the dignity of his family, it was neceſſary for me to aſſume the veil. Alas! that heart was unfit to be offered at an heavenly ſhrine, which was already devoted to an earthly object. My affections had long been engaged by the younger ſon of a neighbouring nobleman, whoſe character and accompliſhments attracted my early love, and confirmed my lateſt eſteem. Our families were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate, and our youthful intercourſe occaſioned an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment, which ſtrengthened and expanded with our years. He ſolicited me of my father, but there appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an inſuperable barrier to our union. The family of my lover laboured under circumſtances of ſimilar diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs with that of my own—it was noble—but poor!

My father, who was ignorant of the ſtrength of my affection, and who conſidered a marriage formed in poverty as deſtructive to happineſs, prohibited his ſuit.</p>
               <p>"Touched with chagrin and diſappointment, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately entered into the ſervice of his Neapolitan majeſty, and ſought in the tumultuous ſcenes of glory, a refuge from the pangs of diſappointed paſſion.</p>

But I was now threatened with a new evil, terrible and unexpected. I was ſo unfortunate as to attract the admiration of the marquis Marinelli, and he appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to my father. He was illuſtrious at once in birth and fortune, and his viſits could only be unwelcome to me. Dreadful was the moment in which my father diſcloſed to me the propoſal. My diſtreſs which I vainly endeavoured to command, diſcovered the exact ſituation of my heart, and my father was affected.</p>
               <p>"After a long and awful pauſe, he generouſly releaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me from my diſtreſs, by leaving it to my choice to accept the marquis, or to aſſume the veil. I fell at his feet overcome by the noble diſintereſtedneſs of his conduct, and inſtantly accepted the latter.</p>
               <p>"This affair removed intirely the diſguiſe with which I had hitherto guarded my heart;—my brother—my generous brother! learned the true ſtate of its affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. He ſaw the grief which preyed upon my health; he obſerved it to my father, and he nobly—

oh how nobly! to reſtore my happineſs, deſired to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign a part of the eſtate which had already deſcended to him in right of his mother. "Alas! Hippolitus," continued Cornelia, deeply ſighing, "thy virtues de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved a better fate."</p>

"The ſame," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the nun, in a tone of ſurpriſe, Julia was ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; tears, however, came to her relief. The aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment of Cornelia for ſome moments ſurpaſſed expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; at length a gleam of recollection croſſed her mind, and ſhe too well underſtood the ſcene before her.

               <p>"My father, ſtruck with the conduct of Hippoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, pauſed upon the offer. The alteration in my health was too obvious to eſcape his notice; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict between pride and parental tenderneſs, held him for ſome time in indeciſion, but the latter finally ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued every oppoſing feeling, and he yielded his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to my marriage with Angelo. The ſudden tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition from grief to joy, was almoſt too much for my feeble frame; judge then what muſt have been the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the dreadful reverſe, when the news arrived that Angelo had fallen in a foreign engagement! Let me obliterate, if poſſible, the impreſſion of ſenſations ſo dreadful. The ſufferings of my brother, whoſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous heart could ſo finely feel for another's woe, were on this occaſion inferior only to my own.</p>
               <p>"After the firſt exceſs of my grief was ſubſided, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to retire from a world which, had tempted me

only with illuſive viſions of happineſs, and to remove from thoſe ſcenes which prompted recollection, and perpetuated my diſtreſs. My father applauded my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, and I immediately was admitted a noviciate into this monaſtery, with the Superior of which my father had in his youth been acquainted.</p>
               <p>"At the expiration of the year I received the veil, Oh! I well remember with what perfect reſignation, with what comfortable complacency I took thoſe vows which bound me to a life of retirement, and religious reſt.</p>
               <p>"The high importance of the moment, the ſolemnity of the ceremony, the ſacred gloome which ſurrounded me, and the chilling ſilence that prevailed when I ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the irrevocable vow—all conſpired to impreſs my imagination, and to raiſe my views to heaven. When I knelt at the altar, the ſacred flame of pure devotion glowed in my heart, and elevated my ſoul to ſublimity. The world and thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"Soon after my noviciation, I had the misfortune to loſe my dear father. In the tranquility of this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery, however, in the ſoothing kindneſs of my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, and in devotional exerciſes, my ſorrows found relief, and the ſting of grief was blunted. My repoſe was of ſhort continuance. A circumſtance occurred that renewed the miſery, which can now never quit me but in the grave, ſo which I look with no fearful ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, but as a refuge from calamity, truſting that the power who has ſeen good to afflict me, will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the imperfectneſs of my devotion, and the too frequent wandering of my thoughts to the objects once ſo dear to me."</p>
               <p>As ſhe ſpoke ſhe raiſed her eyes, which beamed with

               <p>"One day, Oh! never ſhall I forget it, I went as uſual to the confeſſional to acknowledge my ſins. I knelt before the father with eyes bent towards the earth, and in a low voice proceeded to confeſs. I had but one crime to deplore, and that was the too tender remembrance of him for whom I mourned, and whoſe idea impreſſed upon my heart, made it a blemiſhed of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to God.</p>
               <p>"I was interrupted in my confeſſion by a ſound of deep ſobs, and raiſing my eyes, Oh God, what were my ſenſations, when in the features of the holy father, I diſcovered Angelo! His image faded like a viſion from my ſight, and I ſunk at his feet. On recovering I found myſelf on my matraſs attended by a ſiſter, who I diſcovered by her converſation had no ſuſpicion of the occaſion of my diſorder. Indiſpoſition confined me to my bed for ſeveral days; when I recovered, I ſaw Angelo no more, and could almoſt have doubted my ſenſes, and believed that an illuſion had croſſed my ſight, till one day I found in my cell a written paper. I diſtinguiſhed at the firſt glance the hand writing of Angelo, that well known hand which had ſo often a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened me to other emotions. I trembled at the ſight; my beating heart acknowledged the beloved characters; a cold tremor ſhook my frame, and half breathleſs I ſeized the paper. But recollecting my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, I pauſed—I heſitated: duty at length yielded to the ſtrong temptation, and I read the lines. Oh! thoſe lines! prompted by deſpair, and bathed in my tears! every word they offered gave a new pang to my heart, and ſwelled its anguiſh almoſt beyond endurance. I learned that Angelo, ſeverely wounded in a foreign
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:029381_0143_0FE0D477D9F93738"/>
engagement, had been left for dead upon the field I that his life was ſaved by the humanity of a common ſoldier of the enemy, who perceiving ſigns of exiſtence conveyed him to a houſe. Aſſiſtance was ſoon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, but his wounds exhibited the moſt alarming ſymptoms. During ſeveral months he languiſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween life and death, till at length his youth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution ſurmounted the conflict, and he returned to Naples. Here he ſaw my brother, whoſe diſtreſs and aſtoniſhment at beholding him occaſioned a relation of paſt circumſtances, and of the vows I had taken in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the report of his death. It is unneceſſary to mention the immediate effect of this narration; the final one exhibited a very ſingular proof of his attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and deſpair;—he devoted himſelf to a monaſtie life, and choſe this abbey for the place of his reſidence, becauſe it contained the object moſt dear to his affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. His letter informed me that he had purpoſely avoided diſcovering himſelf, endeavouring to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with the opportunities which occurred of ſilent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerving me, till chance had occaſioned the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going interview.—But that ſince its effects had been ſo mutually painful, he would relieve me from the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of a ſimilar diſtreſs, by aſſuring me, that I ſhould ſee him no more. He was faithful to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; from that day I have never ſeen him, and an even ignorant whether he yet inhabits this aſylum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the efforts of religious fortitude, and the juſt fear of exciting ſurpriſe, having withheld me from inquiry. But the moment of our laſt interview has been equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fatal to my peace and to my health, and I truſt I ſhall ere very long be releaſed from the agonizing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual ſtruggles occaſioned by the conſciouſneſs of ſacred vows imperfectly performed, and by earthly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections not wholly ſubdued."</p>

               <p>JULIA accuſtomed herſelf to walk in the fine even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings under the ſhade of the high trees that environed the abbey. The dewy coolneſs of the air refreſhed her. The innumerable roſeat tints which the parting ſun-beams reflected on the rocks above, and the fine vermeil glow diffuſed over the romantic ſcene beneath, ſoftly fading from the eye, as the night-ſhades fell, excited ſenſations of a ſweet and tranquil nature, and ſoothed her into a temporary forgetfulneſs of her ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows.</p>
               <p>The deep ſolitude of the place ſubdued her appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, and one evening ſhe ventured with Madame de Menon to lengthen her walk. They returned to
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:029381_0145_0FE0D483938E5CE8"/>
the abbey without having ſeen a human being, except a friar of the monaſtery, who had been to a neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing town to order proviſion. On the following even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they repeated their walk; and engaged in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, rambled to a conſiderable diſtance from the abbey. The diſtant bell of the monaſtery ſounding for veſpers, reminded them of the hour, and looking round, they perceived the extremity of the wood. They were returning towards the abbey, when ſtruck by the appearance of ſome majeſtic columns which were diſtinguiſhable between the trees, they pauſed. Curioſity tempted them to examine to what edifice pillars of ſuch magnificent architecture could belong in a ſcene ſo rude, and they went on.</p>
               <p>There appeared on a point of rock impending over the valley, the reliques of a palace, whoſe beauty time had impaired only to heighten its ſublimity. An arch of ſingular magnificence remained almoſt entire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond which appeared wild cliffs retiring in grand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective. The ſun, which was now ſetting, threw a trembling luſtre upon the ruins, and gave a finiſhing effect to the ſcene. They gazed in mute wonder upon the view; but the faſt fading light, and the dewy chill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the air warned them to return. As Julia gave a laſt look to the ſcene, ſhe perceived two men leaning upon a part of the ruin at ſome diſtance, in earneſt converſation. As they ſpoke, their looks were ſo at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively bent on her, that ſhe could have no doubt ſhe was the ſubject of their diſcourſe. Alarmed at this circumſtance, Madame and Julia immediately retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards the abbey. They walked ſwiftly through the woods, whoſe ſhades, deepened by the gloom of evening, prevented their diſtinguiſhing whether they were purſued. They were ſurpriſed to obſerve the diſtance to which they had ſtrayed from the monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:029381_0146_0FE0D487C39E29A8"/>
whoſe dark towers were now obſcurely ſeen riſing among the trees that cloſed the perſpective. They had almoſt reached the gates, when on looking back, they perceived the ſame men ſlowly advancing, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any appearance of purſuit, but clearly as if obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the place of their retreat.</p>
               <p>This incident occaſioned Julia much alarm. She could not but believe that the men whom ſhe had ſeen were ſpies of the marquis:—if ſo, her aſylum was diſcovered, and ſhe had every thing to apprehend. Madame now judged it neceſſary to the ſafety of Julia, that the Abate ſhould be informed of her ſtory, and of the ſanctuary ſhe had ſought in his monaſtery, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that he ſhould be ſolicited to protect her from pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rental tyranny. This was a hazardous, but a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtep to provide againſt the certain danger which muſt enſue, ſhould the marquis, if he demanded his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Abate, be the firſt to acquaint him with her ſtory. If ſhe acted otherwiſe, ſhe feared that the Abate in whoſe generoſity ſhe had not confided, and whoſe pity ſhe had not ſolicited, would, in the pride of his reſentment, deliver her up, and thus would ſhe become a certain victim to the duke de Luovo.</p>
               <p>Julia approved of this communication, though ſhe trembled for the event: and requeſted Madame to plead her cauſe with the Abate. On the following morning, therefore, Madame ſolicited a private audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Abate; ſhe obtained permiſſion to ſee him, and Julia in trembling anxiety, watched her to the door of his apartment. The conference was long, and every moment ſeemed an hour to Julia, who, in fearful expectation, awaited with Cornelia the ſentence which would decide her deſtiny. She was now the conſtant companion of Cornelia, whoſe declining,
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:029381_0147_0FE0D48E67AD70B0"/>
health intereſted her pity, and ſtrengthened her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile Madame developed to the Abate the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſsful ſtory of Julia. She praiſed her virtues, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended her accompliſhments, and deplored her ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. She deſcribed the characters of the marquis and the duke, and concluded with pathetically repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting, that Julia had ſought in this monaſtery, a laſt aſylum from injuſtice and miſery, and with entreating that the Abate would grant her his pity and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</p>
               <p>The Abate during this diſcourſe preſerved a ſullen ſilence; his eyes were bent to the ground, and his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect was thoughtful and ſolemn. When Madame ceaſed to ſpeak, a pauſe of proſound ſilence enſued, and ſhe ſat in anxious expectation. She endeavoured to anticipate in his countenance the anſwer preparing, but ſhe derived no comfort from thence. At length raiſing his head, and awakening from his deep reverie, he told her that her requeſt required deliberation, and that the protection ſhe ſolicited for Julia, might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve him in ſerious conſequences, ſince from a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter ſo determined as the marquis's, much violence might reaſonably be expected. "Should his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be refuſed him," concluded the Abate, "he may even dare to violate the ſanctuary."</p>
               <p>Madame ſhocked by the ſtern indifference of this reply, was a moment ſilent. The Abate went on. "Whatever I ſhall determine upon, the young lady has reaſon to rejoice that ſhe is admitted into this holy houſe; for I will even now venture to aſſure her, that if the marquis fails to demand her, ſhe ſhall be permitted to remain in this ſanctuary unmoleſted. You, Madam, will be ſenſible of this indulgence, and of the value of the ſacrifice I make in granting it;
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:029381_0148_0FE0D4942DA424A0"/>
for in thus concealing a child from her parent, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage her in diſobedience, and conſequently ſacrifice my ſenſe of duty, to what may be juſtly called a weak humanity."</p>
               <p>Madame liſtened to this pompous declamation in ſilent ſorrow and indignation. She made another ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to intereſt the Abate in favour of Julia, but he preſerved his ſtern inflexibility, and repeating that he would deliberate upon the matter, and acquaint her with the reſult, he aroſe with great ſolemnity, and quitted the room.</p>
               <p>She now half repented of the confidence ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in him, and of the pity ſhe had ſolicited, ſince he diſcovered a mind incapable of underſtanding the firſt, and a temper inacceſſible to the influence of the latter. With an heavy heart ſhe returned to Julia, who read in her countenance, at the moment ſhe enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the room, news of no happy import. When Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame related the particulars of the conference, Julia preſaged from it only miſery, and giving herſelf up for loſt—ſhe burſt into tears. She ſeverely deplored the confidence ſhe had been induced to yield; for ſhe now ſaw herſelf in the power of a man, ſtern and unfeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his nature; and from whom, if he thought it fit to betray her, ſhe had no means of eſcaping. But ſhe concealed the anguiſh of her heart; and to conſole Madame, affected to hope where ſhe could only deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair.</p>

               <p>One morning Cornelia entering her room with a diſturbed and impatient air, informed her that ſome emiſſaries from the marquis were then in the monaſtery,
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:029381_0149_0FE0D49905EBB388"/>
having inquired at the gate for the Abate, with whom, they ſaid, they had buſineſs of importance to tranſact. The Abate had granted them immediate audience, and they were now in cloſe conference.</p>
               <p>At this intelligence the ſpirits of Julia forſook her; ſhe trembled, grew pale, and ſtood fixed in mute deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair. Madame, though ſcarcely leſs diſtreſſed, retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a preſence of mind. She underſtood too juſtly the character of the Superior, to doubt that he would he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitate in delivering Julia to the hands of the marquis. On this moment, therefore, turned the criſis of her fate!—this moment ſhe might eſcape—the next ſhe was a priſoner. She therefore adviſed Julia to ſeize the inſtant, and fly from the monaſtery before the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference was concluded, when the gates would moſt probably be cloſed upon her, aſſuring her, at the ſame time, ſhe would accompany her in flight.</p>
               <p>The generous conduct of Madame called tears of gratitude into the eyes of Julia, who now awoke from the ſtate of ſtupefaction which diſtreſs had cauſed. But before ſhe could thank her faithful friend, a nun entered the room with a ſummons for Madame to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Abate immediately. The diſtreſs which this meſſage occaſioned cannot eaſily be conceived. Madame adviſed Julia to eſcape while ſhe detained the Abate in converſation, as it was not probable that he had yet iſſued orders for her detention. Leaving her to this attempt, with an aſſurance of following her from the abbey as ſoon as poſſible, Madame obeyed the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. The coolneſs of her fortitude forſook her as ſhe approached the Abate's apartment, and ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came leſs certa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Abate was alone. His countenance was pale with anger, and he was pacing the room with ſlow but agitated ſteps. The ſtern authority of his look

                  </gap>r into the utmoſt aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. She took the letter. It was dictated by that ſpirit of proud vindictive rage, which ſo ſtrongly marked the character of the marquis. Having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the retreat of Julia, and believing the monaſtery afforded her a willing ſanctuary from his purſuit, he accuſed the Abate of encouraging his child in open re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion to his will. He loaded him and his ſacred or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with opprobrium, and threatened, if ſhe was not immediately reſigned to the emiſſaries in waiting, he would in perſon lead on a force which ſhould compel the church to yield to the ſuperior authority of the father.</p>
               <p>The ſpirit of the Abate was rouſed by this menace; and Julia obtained from his pride, that protection which neither his principle nor his humanity would have granted. "The man ſhall tremble," cried he, "who dares defy our power, or queſtion our ſacred authority. The lady Julia is ſafe. I will protect her from this proud invader of our rights, and teach him at leaſt to venerate the power he cannot conquer. I have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched his emiſſaries with my anſwer."</p>
               <p>Theſe words ſtruck ſudden joy upon the heart of Madame de Menon, but ſhe inſtantly recollected, that ere this time Julia had quitted the abbey, and thus the very precaution which was meant to enſure her ſafety, had probably precipitated her into the hand of her enemy. This thought changed her joy to anguiſh; and ſhe was hurrying from the apartment in a ſort of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ild hope, that Julia might not yet be gone, when
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:029381_0151_0FE0D4A6847C1A10"/>
the ſtern voice of the Abate arreſted her. "Is it thus," cried he, "that you receive the knowledge of our generous reſolution to protect your friend? Does ſuch condeſcending kindneſs merit no thanks—demand no gratitude?" Madame returned in an agony of fea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, leſt one moment of delay might prove fatal to Julia, if happily ſhe had not yet quitted the monaſtery. She was conſcious of her deficiency in apparent gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and of the ſtrange appearance of her abrupt departure from the Abate, for which it was impoſſible to apologize, without betraying the ſecret, which would kindle all his reſentment. Yet ſome atonement his preſent anger demanded, and theſe circumſtances cauſed her a very painful embarraſſment. She formed a haſty excuſe; and expreſſing her ſenſe of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, again attempted to retire, when the Abate frown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in deep reſentment, his features inflamed with pride, aroſe from his ſeat. "Stay," ſaid he, "whence this impatience to fly from the preſence of a benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor!—If my generoſity fail to excite gratitude, my reſentment ſhall not fail to inſpire awe.—Since the lady Julia is inſenſible of my condeſcenſion, ſhe is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of my protection, and I will reſign her to the tyrant who demands her."</p>
               <p>To this ſpeech, in which the offended pride of the Abate overcoming all ſenſe of juſtice, accuſed and threatened to puniſh Julia for the fault of her friend, Madame liſtened in dreadful impatience. Every word that detained her ſtruck torture to her heart, but the concluding ſentence occaſioned new terror, and ſhe ſtarted at its purpoſe. She fell at the feet of the Abate in an agony of grief. "Holy father," ſaid ſhe, "puniſh not Julia for the offence which I only have committed; her heart will bleſs her generous

protector, and for myſelf, ſuffer me to aſſure you that I am fully ſenſible of your goodneſs."</p>
               <p>"If this is true," ſaid the Abate, "ariſe, and bid the lady Julia attend me." This command increaſed the confuſion of Madame, who had no doubt that her detention had proved fatal to Julia. At length ſhe was ſuffered to depart, and to her infinite joy found Julia in her own room. Her intention of eſcaping had yielded immediately after the departure of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, to the fear of being diſcovered by the marquis's people. This fear had been confirmed by the report of Cornelia, who informed her, that at that time ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral horſemen were waiting at the gates for the return of their companions. This was a dreadful circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to Julia, who perceived it was utterly impoſſible to quit the monaſtery, without ruſhing upon certain deſtruction. She was lamenting her deſtiny, when Madame recited the particulars of the late interview, and delivered the ſummons of the Abate.</p>
               <p>They had now to dread the effect of that tender anxiety, which had excited his reſentment; and Julia ſuddenly elated to joy by his firſt determination, was as ſuddenly ſunk to deſpair by his laſt. She trembled with apprehenſion of the common interview, though each moment of delay, which her fear ſolicited, would by heightening the reſentment of the Abate, only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the danger ſhe dreaded.</p>
               <p>At length by a ſtrong effort ſhe reanimated her ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and went to the Abate's cloſet to receive her ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. He was ſeated in his chair, and his frowning aſpect chilled her heart. "Daughter," ſaid he, "you have been guilty of heinous crimes. You have dared to diſpute—nay, openly to rebel, againſt the lawful authority of your father. You have diſobeyed the
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:029381_0153_0FE0D4B213BB6440"/>
will of him whoſe prerogative yields only to ours. You have queſtioned his right upon a point of all others the moſt decided—the right of a father to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of his child in marriage. You have even fled from his protection—and you have dared—inſidiouſly, and meanly have dared, to ſcreen your diſobedience beneath this ſacred roof. You have profaned our ſanctuary with your crime. You have brought inſult upon our ſacred order, and have cauſed bold and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious defiance of our high prerogative. What puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is adequate to guilt like this?"</p>
               <p>The father pauſed—his eyes ſternly fixed on Julia, who pale and trembling, could ſcarcely ſupport her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and who had no power to reply. "I will be merciful, and not juſt," reſumed he,—"I will ſoften the puniſhment you deſerve, and will only deliver you to your father." At theſe dreadful words, Julia burſting into tears, ſunk at the feet of the Abate, to whom ſhe raiſed her eyes in ſupplicating expreſſion, but was unable to ſpeak. He ſuffered her to remain in this poſture. "Your duplicity," he reſumed, "is not the leaſt of your offences. Had you relied upon our generoſity for forgiveneſs and protection, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence might have been granted;—but under diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe of virtue you concealed your crimes, and your neceſſities were hid beneath the maſk of devotion."</p>
               <p>Theſe falſe aſperſions rouſed in Julia the ſpirit of indignant virtue; ſhe aroſe from her knees with an air of dignity, that ſtruck even the Abate. "Holy father," ſaid ſhe, "my heart abhors the crime you mention, and diſclaims all union with it. Whatever are my offences—from the ſin of hypocriſy I am at leaſt free; and you will pardon me if I remind you, that my confidence has already been ſuch, as fully
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:029381_0154_0FE0D4B98B1D3ED0"/>
juſtifies my claim to the protection I ſolicit. When I ſheltered myſelf within theſe walls, it was to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed that they would protect me from injuſtice; and with what other term than injuſtice would you, Sir, diſtinguiſh the conduct of the marquis, if the fear of his power did not overcome the dictates of truth?"</p>
               <p>The Abate felt the full force of this reproof; but diſdaining to appear ſenſible to it, reſtrained his reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. His wounded pride thus exaſperated, and all the malignant paſſions of his nature thus called into action, he was prompted to that cruel ſurrender which he had never before ſeriouſly intended. The offence which Madame de Menon had unintentionally given, his haughty ſpirit urged him to retaliate in puniſhment. He had, therefore, pleaſed himſelf with exciting a terror which he never meant to confirm, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to be further ſolicited for that protection which he had already determined to grant. But this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof of Julia touched him where he was moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of defect; and the temporary triumph which he imagined it afforded her, kindled his reſentment into flame. He muſed in his chair, in a fixed atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.—She ſaw in his countenance the deep workings of his mind—ſhe revolved the fate preparing for her, and ſtood in trembling anxiety to receive her ſentence. The Abate conſidered each aggravating circumſtance of the marquis's menace, and each ſentence of Julia's ſpeech; and his mind experienced, that vice is not only inconſiſtent with virtue, but with itſelf—for to gratify his malignity, he now diſcovered that it would be neceſſary to ſacrifice his pride—ſince it would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to puniſh the object of the firſt, without deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf the gratification of the former. This
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:029381_0155_0FE0D4BEF8127A18"/>
reflexion ſuſpended his mind in a ſtate of torture, and he ſat wrapt in gloomy ſilence.</p>
               <p>The ſpirit which lately animated Julia, had vaniſhed with her words—each moment of ſilence increaſed her apprehenſion; the deep brooding of his thoughts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed her in the apprehenſion of evil, and with all the artleſs eloquence of ſorrow, ſhe endeavoured to ſoften him to pity. He liſtened to her pleadings in ſullen ſtillneſs. But each inſtant now cooled the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of his reſentment to her, and increaſed his deſire of oppoſing the marquis. At length the predominant feature of his character reſumed its original influence, and overcame the workings of ſubordinate paſſion. Proud of his religious authority, he determined never to yield the prerogative of the church to that of the father, and reſolved to oppoſe the violence of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis with equal force.</p>
               <p>He therefore condeſcended to relieve Julia from her terrors, by aſſuring her of his protection: but he did this in a manner ſo ungracious, as almoſt to deſtroy the gratitude which the promiſe demanded. She haſtened with the joyful intelligence to Madame de Menon, who wept over her, tears of thankfulneſs.</p>

               <p>NEAR a fortnight had elapſed without producing an appearance of hoſtility from the marquis, when one night, long after the hour of repoſe, Julia was awakened by the bell of the monaſtery. She knew it was not the hour cuſtomary for prayer, and ſhe liſtened to the ſounds, which rolled through the deep ſilence of the fabric, with ſtrong ſurpriſe and terror. Preſently
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:029381_0156_0FE0D4C40AB3D288"/>
ſhe heard the doors of ſeveral cells creak on their hinges, and the ſound of quick foot-ſteps in the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages—and through the crevices of her door ſhe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed paſſing lights. The whiſpering noiſe of ſteps encreaſed, and every perſon of the monaſtery ſeemed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> awakened. Her terror heightened; it occurred to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er that the marquis had ſurrounded the abbey with his people, in the deſign of forcing her from her retreat; and ſhe aroſe in haſte, with an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of going to the chamber of Madame de Menon, when ſhe heard a gentle tap at the door. Her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry of who was there, was anſwered in the voice of Madame, and her fears were quickly diſſipated, for ſhe learned the bell was a ſummons to attend a dying nun, who was going to the high altar, there to receive ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme unction.</p>
               <p>She quitted the chamber with Madame. In her way to the church, the gleam of tapers on the walls, and the glimpſe which her eye often caught of the friars in their long black habits, deſcending ſilently through the narrow winding paſſages, with the ſolemn toll of the bell, conſpired to kindle imagination, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs her heart with ſacred awe. But the church ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited a ſcene of ſolemnity, ſuch as ſhe had never before witneſſed. Its gloomy aiſles were imperfectly ſeen by the rays of tapers from the high altar, which ſhed a ſolitary gleam over the remote parts of the fabric, and produced large maſſes of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ght and ſhade, ſtriking and ſublime in their effect.</p>
               <p>While ſhe gazed, ſhe heard a diſtant chanting riſe through the aiſles; the ſounds ſwelled in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> murmurs on the ear, and drew nearer and nearer, till a ſudden blaze of light iſſued from one of the portals, and the proceſſion entered. The organ inſtantly founded a high
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:029381_0157_0FE0D4C8A6A36350"/>
and ſolemn peal, and the voices riſing altogether, ſwelled the ſacred ſtrain. In front appeared the <hi>Padre Abate,</hi> with ſlow and meaſured ſteps, bearing the holy croſs. Immediately followed a litter, on which lay the dying perſon covered with a white veil, borne along, and ſurrounded by nuns veiled in white, each carrying in her hand a lighted taper. Laſt came the friars, two and two, clothed in black, and each bearing a light.</p>
               <p>When they reached the high altar the bier was reſted, and in a few moments the anthem ceaſed. The Abate now approached to perform the unction; the veil of the dying nun was lifted—and Julia diſcovered her beloved Cornelia! Her countenance was already im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with the image of death, but her eyes bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened with a faint gleam of recollection, when they fixed upon Julia, who felt a cold thrill run through her frame, and leaned for ſupport on Madame. Julia now for the firſt time diſtinguiſhed the unhappy lover of Cornelia, on whoſe features was depictured the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of his heart, and who hung pale and ſilent over the bier. The ceremony being finiſhed, the anthem ſtruck up; the bier was lifted, when Cornelia faintly moved her hand, and it was again reſted upon the ſteps of the altar. In a few minutes the muſic ceaſed; when lifting her heavy eyes to her lover, with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of ineffable tenderneſs and grief, ſhe attempted to ſpeak, but the ſounds died on her cloſing lips. A faint ſmile paſſed over her countenance, and was ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by a fine devotional glow; ſhe folded her hands upon her boſom, and with a look of meek reſignation, raiſing towards heaven her eyes, in which now ſunk the laſt ſparkles of expiring life—her ſoul departed in a ſhort deep ſigh.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="unknown:029381_0158_0FE0D4CF2EE3E030"/>Her lover ſinking back, endeavoured to conceal his emotions, but the deep ſobs which agitated his breaſt, betrayed his anguiſh, and the tears of every ſpectator bedewed the ſacred ſpot where beauty, ſenſe, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence expired.</p>
               <p>The organ now ſwelled in mournful harmony; and the voices of the aſſembly chanted in choral ſtrain, a low and ſolemn requiem to the ſpirit of the departed.</p>
               <p>Madame hurried Julia, who was almoſt as lifeleſs as her departed friend, from the church. A death ſo ſudden, heightened the grief which ſeparation would otherwiſe have occaſioned. It was the nature of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelia's diſorder, to wear a changeful but flattering aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect. Though ſhe had long been declining, her decay was ſo gradual and imperceptible, as to lull the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of her friends into ſecurity. It was otherwiſe with herſelf; ſhe was conſcious of the change, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore to afflict them with the knowledge of the truth. The hour of her diſſolution was ſudden, even to her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but it was compoſed, and even happy. In the death of Cornelia, Julia ſeemed to mourn again tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In one of the friars of the convent, Madame was ſurpriſed to find the father who had confeſſed the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Vincent. His appearance revived the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the ſcene ſhe had witneſſed at the caſtle of Mazzini; and the laſt words of Vincent, combined with the circumſtances which had ſince occurred, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed all her curioſity and aſtoniſhment. But his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance excited more ſenſations than thoſe of wonder. She dreaded, leſt he ſhould be corrupted by the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis, to whom he was known, and thus be induced to uſe his intereſt with the <hi>Abate,</hi> for the reſtoration of Julia.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="160" facs="unknown:029381_0159_0FE0D4D49C69D1A8"/>From the walls of the monaſtery, Julia now never ventured to ſtray. In the glooms of evening ſhe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſtole into the cloiſters, and often lingered at the grave of Cornelia, where ſhe wept for Hippolitus, as well as for her friend. One evening, during veſpers, the bell of the convent was ſuddenly rang out; the <hi>Abate,</hi> whoſe countenance expreſſed at once aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and diſpleaſure, ſuſpended the ſervice, and quitted the altar. The whole congregation repaired to the hall, where they learned that a friar, retiring to the convent, had ſeen a troop of armed men advancing through the wood; and not doubting they were the people of the marquis, and were approaching with hoſtile intention, had thought it neceſſary to give the alarm. The <hi>Abate</hi> aſcended a turret, and thence diſcovered through the trees a glittering of arms, and in the ſucceeding moment a band of men iſſued from a dark part of the wood, into a long avenue which immediately fronted the ſpot where he ſtood. The clattering of hoofs was now diſtinctly heard; and Julia, ſinking with terror, diſtinguiſhed the marquis heading the troop, which ſoon after ſeparating into two diviſions, ſurrounded the monaſtery. The gates were immediately ſecured; and the <hi>Abate,</hi> deſcending from the turret, aſſembled the friars in the hall, where his voice was ſoon heard above every other part of the tumult. The terror of Julia made her utterly forgetful of the <hi>Padre</hi>'s promiſe, and ſhe wiſhed to fly for concealment to the deep ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns belonging to the monaſtery, which wound under the woods. Madame, whoſe penetration furniſhed her with a juſt knowledge of the <hi>Abate</hi>'s character, found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ſecurity on his pride. She therefore diſſuaded Julia from attempting to tamper with the honeſty of a ſervant who had the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="161" facs="unknown:029381_0160_0FE0D4DAFA821A88"/>
to rely entirely on the effort of the <hi>Abate</hi>'s reſentment towards the marquis. While Madame endeavoured to ſooth her to compoſure, a meſſage from the <hi>Abate,</hi> required her immediate attendance. She obeyed, and he bade her follow him to a room which was directly over the gates of the monaſtery. From thence ſhe ſaw her father, accompanied by the duke de Luovo; and as her heart died away at the ſight, the marquis called furiouſly to the <hi>Abate</hi> to deliver her inſtantly into his hands, threatening, if ſhe was detained, to force the gates of the monaſtery. At this threat the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the <hi>Abate</hi> grew dark; and leading Julia for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly to the window from which ſhe had ſhrunk back, "Impious menacer!" ſaid he, "eternal vengeance be upon thee! From this moment we expel thee from all the rights and communities of our church. Arrogant and daring as you are, your threats I defy." "Look here," ſaid he, pointing to Julia, "and learn that you you are in my power; for if you dare to violate theſe ſacred walls, I will proclaim aloud in the face of day, a ſecret which ſhall make your heart's blood run cold; a ſecret which involves your honour, nay, your very exiſtence. Now triumph and exult in impious me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace!" The marquis ſtarted involuntarily at this ſpeech, and his features underwent a ſudden change, but he endeavoured to recover himſelf, and to conceal his confuſion. He heſitated for a few moments, uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain how to act—to deſiſt from violence was to confeſs himſelf conſcious of the threatening ſecret<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet he dreaded to inflame the reſentment of the <hi>Abate,</hi> whoſe menaces his own heart too ſurely ſeconded. At length —"All that you have uttered," ſaid he, "I deſpiſe as the daſtardly ſubterfuge of monkiſh cunning. Your new inſults add to the deſire of recovering my daughter,
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:029381_0161_0FE0D4E06A689528"/>
and that of puniſhing you; I would proceed to inſtant violence, but that would now be an imperfect revenge. I ſhall therefore withdraw my forces, and appeal to a higher power. Thus ſhall you be compelled at once to reſtore my daughter, and retract your ſcandalous impeachment of my honour." Saying this, he turned his horſe from the gates, and his people following him, quickly withdrew, leaving the <hi>Abate</hi> exulting in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and Julia loſt in aſtoniſhment and doubtful joy. When ſhe recounted to Madame the particulars of the conference, ſhe dwelt with emphaſis on the threats of the <hi>Abate;</hi> but Madame, though her amazement was heightened at every word, very well underſtood how the ſecret, whatever it was, had been obtained. The confeſſor of Vincent ſhe had already obſerved in the monaſtery, and there was no doubt that he had diſcloſed whatever could be collected from the dying words of Vincent. She knew, alſo, that the ſecret would never be publiſhed, unleſs as a puniſhment for immediate violence, it being one of the firſt principles of a monaſtic duty, to obſerve a religious ſecrecy upon all matters intruſted to them in confeſſion.</p>
               <p>When the firſt tumult of Julia's emotions ſubſided, the joy which the ſudden departure of the marquis oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned, yielded to apprehenſion. He had threatened to appeal to a higher power, who would compel the <hi>Abate</hi> to ſurrender her. This menace excited a juſt terror, and there remained no means of avoiding the tyranny of the marquis, but by quitting the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery. She therefore requeſted an audience of the <hi>Abate;</hi> and having repreſented the danger of her preſent ſituation, ſhe intreated his permiſſion to depart in queſt of a ſafer retreat. The <hi>Abate,</hi> who well knew the marquis was wholly in his power, laughed at the repetition of his menaces, and
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:029381_0162_0FE0D4E648036FF8"/>
denied her requeſt, under pretence of his having now become reſponſible for her to the church. He bade her be comforted, and promiſed her his protection; but his aſſurances were given in ſo diſtant and haughty a manner, that Julia left him with fears, rather increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than ſubdued. In croſſing the hall, ſhe obſerved a man haſtily enter it from an oppoſite door. He was not in the habit of the order, but was muffled up in a cloak, and ſeemed to wiſh concealment. As ſhe paſſed he raiſed his head, and Julia diſcovered—her father! He darted at her a look of vengeance; but, before ſhe had time even to think, as if ſuddenly recollecting himſelf, he covered his face, and ruſhed by her. Her trembling frame could ſcarcely ſupport her to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment of Madame, where ſhe ſunk ſpeechleſs upon a chair, and the horror of her look alone ſpoke the agony of her mind. When ſhe was ſomewhat recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhe related what ſhe had ſeen, and her converſation with the <hi>Abate.</hi> But Madame was loſt in equal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity with herſelf, when ſhe attempted to account for the marquis's appearance. Why, after his late daring menace, ſhould he come ſecretly to viſit the <hi>Abate,</hi> by whoſe connivance alone he could have gained admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the monaſtery? And what could have influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced the <hi>Abate</hi> to ſuch a conduct? Theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, though equally inexplicable, united to confirm a fear of treachery and ſurrender. To eſcape from the abbey was now impracticable, for the gates were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly guarded; and even was it poſſible to paſs them, certain detection awaited Julia without from the marquis's people, who were ſtationed in the woods. Thus encompaſſed with danger, ſhe could only await in the monaſtery the iſſue of her deſtiny.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="164" facs="unknown:029381_0163_0FE0D4ECB9268610"/>While ſhe was lamenting with Madame her unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ſtate, ſhe was ſummoned once more to attend the <hi>Abate.</hi> At this moment her ſpirits entirely forſook her; the criſis of her fate ſeemed arrived; for ſhe did not doubt that the <hi>Abate</hi> intended to ſurrender her to the marquis, with whom ſhe ſuppoſed he had negocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the terms of accommodation. It was ſome time before ſhe could recover compoſure ſufficient to obey the ſummons; and when ſhe did, every ſtep that bore her towards the <hi>Abate</hi>'s room, increaſed her dread. She pauſed a moment at the door, 'ere ſhe had cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to open it; the idea of her father's immediate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment aroſe to her mind, and ſhe was upon the point of retreating to her chamber, when a ſudden ſtep within, near the door, deſtroyed her heſitation, and ſhe entered the cloſet. The marquis was not there, and her ſpirits revived. The fluſh of triumph was diffuſed over the features of the <hi>Abate,</hi> though a ſhade of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeaſed reſentment yet remained viſible. "Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter," ſaid he, "the intelligence we have to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate may rejoice you. Your ſafety now depends ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on yourſelf. I give your fate into your own hands, and its iſſue be upon your head." He pauſed, and ſhe was ſuſpended in wondering expectation of the coming ſentence. "I here ſolemnly aſſure you of my protection, but it is upon one condition only—that you renounce the world, and dedicate your days to God." Julia liſtened with a mixture of grief and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſhment. "Without this conceſſion on your part, I poſſeſs not the power, had I even the inclination, to protect you. If you aſſume the veil, you are ſafe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the pale of the church from temporal violence. If you neglect or refuſe to do this, the marquis may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to a power from whom I have no appeal, and I ſhall be compelled at laſt to reſign you."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="165" facs="unknown:029381_0164_0FE0D4F2442EBD60"/>"But to enſure your ſafety, ſhould the veil be your choice, we will procure a diſpenſation from the uſual forms of noviciation, and a few days ſhall confirm your vows." He ceaſed to ſpeak; but Julia, agitat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the moſt cruel diſtreſs, knew not what to reply. "We grant you three days to decide upon this matter," continued he, "at the expiration of which, the veil, or the duke de Luovo, awaits you." Julia quitted the cloſet in mute deſpair, and repaired to Madame, who could now ſcarcely offer her the humble benefit of conſolation.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile the <hi>Abate</hi> exulted in ſucceſsful ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, and the marquis ſmarted beneath the ſtings of diſappointment. The menace of the former was too ſeriouſly alarming to ſuffer the marquis to proſecute violent meaſures; and he had therefore reſolved, by oppoſing avarice to pride, to ſoothe the power which he could not ſubdue. But he was unwilling to entruſt the <hi>Abate</hi> with a proof of his compliance and his fears, by offering a bribe in a letter, and preferred the more humiliating, but ſafer method, of a private interview. His magnificent offers created a temporary heſitation in the mind of the <hi>Abate,</hi> who, ſecure of his advantage, ſhowed at firſt no diſpoſition to be reconciled, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the marquis to depart in anxious uncertainty. After maturely deliberating upon the propoſals, the pride of the <hi>Abate</hi> ſurmounted his avarice; and he determined to prevail upon Julia effectually to deſtroy the hopes of the marquis, by conſecrating her life to religion. Julia paſſed the night and the next day in a ſtate of mental torture exceeding all deſcription. The gates of the monaſtery beſet with guards, and the woods ſurrounded by the marquis's people, made eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape impoſſible. From a marriage with the duke,
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:029381_0165_0FE0D4F6D91441F0"/>
whoſe late conduct had confirmed the odious idea which his character had formerly impreſſed, her heart recoiled in horror, and to be immured for life within the walls of a convent, was a fate little leſs dreadful. Yet ſuch was the effect of that ſacred love ſhe bore the memory of Hippolitus, and ſuch her averſion to the duke, that ſhe ſoon reſolved to adopt the veil. On the following evening ſhe informed the <hi>Abate</hi> of her determination. His heart ſwelled with ſecret joy; and even the natural ſeverity of his manner relaxed at the intelligence. He aſſured her of his approbation and protection, with a degree of kindneſs which he had never before manifeſted, and told her the ceremony ſhould be performed on the ſecond day from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. Her emotion ſcarcely ſuffered her to hear his laſt words. Now that her fate was fixed beyond recall, ſhe almoſt repented of her choice. Her fancy attached to it a horror not its own; and that evil, which, when offered to her deciſion, ſhe had accepted with little heſitation, ſhe now pauſed upon in dubious regret; ſo apt we are to imagine that the calamity moſt certain, is alſo the moſt intolerable!</p>
               <p>When the marquis read the anſwer of the <hi>Abate,</hi> all the baleful paſſions of his nature were rouſed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed to a degree which bordered upon diſtraction. In the firſt impulſe of his rage, he would have forced the gates of the monaſtery, and defied the utmoſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of his enemy. But a moment's reflexion revived his fear of the threatened ſecret, and he ſaw that he was ſtill in the power of the Superior.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Abate</hi> procured the neceſſary diſpenſation, and preparations were immediately begun for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching ceremony. Julia watched the departure of thoſe moments which led to her fate with the calm
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:029381_0166_0FE0D4FD587E4380"/>
fortitude of deſpair. She had no means of eſcaping from the coming evil, without expoſing herſelf to a worſe; ſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ſurveyed it therefore with a ſteady eye, and no longer ſhrunk from its approach.</p>
               <p>On the morning preceding the day of her conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhe was informed that a ſtranger inquired for her at the grate. Her mind had been ſo long accuſtomed to the viciſſitudes of apprehenſion, that fear was the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion which now occurred; ſhe ſuſpected, yet ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knew why, that the marquis was below, and heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated whether to deſcend. A little reflexion deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined her, and ſhe went to the parlour—where to her equal joy and ſurpriſe ſhe beheld—Ferdinand!</p>
               <p>During the abſence of the marquis from his caſtle, Ferdinand, who had been informed of the diſcovery of Julia, effected his eſcape from impriſonment and had haſtened to the monaſtery in the deſign of reſcuing her. He had paſſed the woods in diſguiſe, with much difficulty eluding the obſervation of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis's people, who were yet diſperſed round the abbey. To the monaſtery, as he came alone, he had been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted without difficulty.</p>
               <p>When he learned the conditions of the <hi>Abate</hi>'s pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and that the following day was appointed for the conſecration of Julia, he was ſhocked, and pauſed in deliberation. A period ſo ſhort as was this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, afforded little opportunity for contrivance, and leſs for heſitation. The night of the preſent day was the only time that remained for the attempt and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a plan of eſcape, which if it then failed of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, Julia would not only be condemned for life to the walls of the monaſtery, but would be ſubjected to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever puniſhment the ſeverity of the <hi>Abate,</hi> exaſperated by the detection, ſhould think fit to inflict. The
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:029381_0167_0FE0D501EBE457E8"/>
danger was deſperate, but the occaſion was deſperate alſo.</p>
               <p>The nobly diſintereſted conduct of her brother, ſtruck Julia with gratitude and admiration; but deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair of ſucceſs, made her now heſitate whether ſhe ſhould accept his offer. She conſidered that his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity would moſt probably involve him in deſtruction with herſelf; and ſhe pauſed in deep deliberation, when Ferdinand informed her of a circumſtance which, till now, he had purpoſely concealed, and which at once diſſolved every doubt and every fear. "Hippoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus," ſaid Ferdinand, "yet lives." "Lives!" re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Julia faintly,—"lives! Oh! tell me where —how."—Her breath refuſed to aid her, and ſhe ſunk in her chair, overcome with the ſtrong and various ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations that preſſed upon her heart. Ferdinand, whom the grate with-held from aſſiſting her, obſerved her ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation in extreme diſtreſs. When ſhe recovered, he informed her that a ſervant of Hippolitus, ſent no doubt by his lord to inquire concerning Julia, had been lately ſeen by one of the marquis's people in the neighbourhood of the caſtle. From him it was known that the count de Vereza was living, but that his life had been deſpaired of; and he was ſtill confined, by dangerous wounds, in an obſcure town on the coaſt of Italy. The man had ſteadily refuſed to mention the place of his lord's abode. Learning that the marquis was then at the abbey of St. Auguſtin, whither he purſued his daughter, the man diſappeared from Maz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zini, and had not ſince been heard of.</p>
               <p>It was enough for Julia to know that Hippolitus lived; her fears of detection, and her ſcruples con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Ferdinand, inſtantly vaniſhed; ſhe thought only of eſcape—and the means which had lately ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſo formidable—ſo difficult in contrivance, and

                  </gap>o dangerous in execution, now ſeemed eaſy, certain, and almoſt accompliſhed.</p>
               <p>They conſulted on the plan to be adopted; and agreed, that in attempting to bribe a ſervant of the monaſtery to their intereſt, they ſhould incur a danger too eminent, yet it appeared ſcarcely practicable to ſucceed is their ſcheme without riſquing this. After much conſideration, they determined to entruſt their ſecret to no perſon but to Madame. Ferdinand was to contrive to conceal himſelf to the dead of the night in the church, between which and the monaſtery were ſeveral doors of communication. When the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the abbey were ſunk in repoſe, Julia might without difficulty paſs to the church, were Ferdinand awaiting her, they might perhaps eſcape either through an outer door of the fabric, or through a window, for which latter attempt Ferdinand was to provide ropes.</p>
               <p>A couple of horſes were to be ſtationed among the rocks beyond the woods, to convey the fugitives to a ſea-port, whence they could eaſily paſs over to Italy. Having arranged this plan, they ſeparated in the anxious hope of meeting on the enſuing night.</p>
               <p>Madame warmly ſympathized with Julia in her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent expectations, and was now ſomewhat relieved from the preſſure of that ſelf-reproach, with which the conſideration of having withdrawn Julia from a ſecure aſylum, had long tormented her. In learning that Hippolitus lived, Julia experienced a ſudden renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of life and ſpirits. From the languid ſtupefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which deſpair had occaſioned, ſhe revived as from a dream, and her ſenſations reſembled thoſe of a perſon ſuddenly awakened from a frightful viſion, whoſe thoughts are yet obſcured in the fear and uncertainty which the paſſing images have impreſſed on his fancy. She emerged from deſpair; joy illumined her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:029381_0169_0FE0D50E06DBC0A8"/>
yet ſhe doubted the reality of the ſcene which now opened to her view. The hours rolled heavily along till the evening, when expectation gave way to fear, for ſhe was once more ſummoned by the <hi>Abate.</hi> He ſent for her to adminiſter the uſual neceſſary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation on the approaching ſolemnity; and having detained her a conſiderable time in tedious and ſevere diſcourſe, diſmiſſed her with a formal benediction.</p>

               <p>THE evening now ſunk in darkneſs, and the hour was faſt approaching which would decide the fate of Julia. Trembling anxiety now ſubdued every other ſenſation; and as the minutes paſſed, her fears en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed. At length ſhe heard the gates of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery faſtened for the night; the bell rang the ſignal for repoſe; and the paſſing footſteps of the nuns told her they were haſtening to obey it. After ſome time, all was ſilent. Julia did not yet dare to venture forth; ſhe employed the preſent interval in intereſting and affectionate converſation with Madame de Menon, to whom, notwithſtanding her ſituation, her heart bade a ſorrowful adieu.</p>
               <p>The clock ſtruck twelve, when ſhe aroſe to depart. Having embraced her faithful friend with tears of mingled grief and anxiety, ſhe took a lamp in her hand and with cautious, fearful ſteps, deſcended through the long winding paſſages to a private door, which opened into the church of the monaſtery. The church was gloomy and deſolate; and the feeble rays of the lamp ſhe bore, gave only light enough to diſcover its chilling grandeur. As ſhe paſſed ſilently along the
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:029381_0170_0FE0D51233F4C418"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iſles, ſhe caſt a look of anxious examination around— but Ferdinand was no where to be ſeen. She pauſed in timid heſitation, fearful to penetrate the gloomy obſcurity which lay before her, yet dreading to return.</p>
               <p>As ſhe ſtood examining the place, vainly looking for Ferdinand, yet fearing to call leſt her voice ſhould betray her, a hollow groan aroſe from a part of the church very near her. It chilled her heart, and ſhe remained fixed to the ſpot. She turned her eyes a little to the left, and ſaw light appear through the chinks of a ſepulchre at ſome diſtance. The groan was repeated—a low murmuring ſucceeded, and while ſhe yet gazed, an old man iſſued from the vault with a lighted taper in his hand. Terror new ſubdued her, and ſhe uttered an involuntary ſhriek. In the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding moment, a noiſe was heard in a remote part of the fabric; and Ferdinand ruſhing forth from his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment, ran to her aſſiſtance. The old man, who appeared to be a friar, and who had been doing pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance at the monument of a ſaint, now approached. His countenance expreſſed a degree of ſurpriſe and terror almoſt equal to that of Julia's, who now knew him to be the confeſſor of Vincent. Ferdinand ſeized the father, and laying his hand upon his ſword, threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened him with death if he did not inſtantly ſwear to conceal for ever his knowledge of what he then ſaw, and alſo aſſiſt them to eſcape from the abbey.</p>
               <p>"Ungracious boy!" replied the father in a calm voice, "deſiſt from this language, nor add to the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of youth the crime of murdering, or terrifying a defenceleſs old man. Your violence would urge me to become your enemy, did not previous inclination tempt me to be your friend. I pity the diſtreſſes of the lady Julia, to whom I am no ſtranger, and will cheerfully give her all the aſſiſtance in my power."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="172" facs="unknown:029381_0171_0FE0D518D73A4618"/>At theſe words Julia revived, and Ferdinand, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the generoſity of the father, and conſcious of his own inferiority, ſhrunk back. "I have no words to thank you," ſaid he, "or to entreat your pardon for the impetuoſity of my conduct; your know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of my ſituation muſt plead my excuſe." "It does," replied the father, "but we have no time to loſe;—follow me."</p>
               <p>They followed him through the church to the cloiſters, at the extremity of which was a ſmall door, which the friar unlocked.—It opened upon the woods.</p>
               <p>"This path," ſaid he, "leads thro' an intricate part of the woods, to the rocks that riſe on the right of the abbey; in their receſſes you may ſecrete yourſelves till you are prepared for a longer journey. But extinguiſh your light; it may betray you to the marquis's people, who are diſperſed about this ſpot. Farewell! my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and God's bleſſing be upon ye."</p>
               <p>Julia's tears declared her gratitude; ſhe had no time for words. They ſtepped into the path, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cloſed the door. They were now liberated from the monaſtery, but danger awaited them without, which it required all their caution to avoid. Ferdinand knew the path which the friar had pointed out, to be the ſame that led to the rocks where his horſes were ſtationed, and he purſued it with quick and ſilent ſteps. Julia, whoſe fears conſpired with the gloom of night to magnify and transform every object around her, imagined at each ſtep that ſhe took, ſhe perceived the figures of men, and fancied every whiſper of the breeze the ſound of purſuit.</p>
               <p>They proceeded ſwiftly, till Julia breathleſs and exhauſted could go no farther. They had not reſted many minutes, when they heard a ruſtling among the buſhes at ſome diſtance, and ſoon after diſtinguiſhed a
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:029381_0172_0FE0D51D5A7C8480"/>
low ſound of voices. Ferdinand and Julia inſtantly renewed their flight, and thought they ſtill heard voices advance upon the wind. This thought was ſoon confirmed, for the ſounds now gained faſt upon them, and they diſtinguiſhed words which ſerved only to heighten their apprehenſions when they reached the extremity of the woods. The moon, which was now up, ſuddenly emerging from a dark cloud, diſcovered to them ſeveral men in purſuit; and alſo ſhowed to the purſuers the courſe of the fugitives. They endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to gain the rocks where the horſes were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, and which appeared in view. Theſe they reached when the purſuers had almoſt overtaken them —but their horſes were gone! Their only remaining chance of eſcape was to fly into the deep receſſes of the rock. They, therefore, entered a winding cave from whence branched ſeveral ſubterraneous avenues, at the extremity of one of which they ſtopped. The voices of men now vibrated in tremendous echoes through the various and ſecret caverns of the place, and the ſound of footſteps ſeemed faſt approaching. Julia trembled with terror, and Ferdinand drew his ſword, determined to protect her to the laſt. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed volley of voices now ſounded up that part of the cave where Ferdinand and Julia lay concealed. In a few moments the ſteps of the purſuers ſuddenly took a different direction, and the ſounds ſunk gradually away, and were heard no more. Ferdinand liſtened at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively for a conſiderable time, but the ſtillneſs of the place remained undiſturbed. It was now evident that the men had quitted the rock, and he ventured forth to the mouth of the cave. He ſurveyed the wilds around as far as his eye could penetrate, and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed no human being; but in the pauſes of the wind he ſtill thought he heard a ſound of diſtant
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:029381_0173_0FE0D5231D7EC418"/>
voices. As he liſtened in anxious ſilence, his eye caught the appearance of a ſhadow, which moved upon the ground near where he ſtood. He ſtarted back within the cave, but in a few minutes again ventured forth. The ſhadow remained ſtationary; but having watched it for ſome time, Ferdinand ſaw it glide along till it diſappeared behind a point of rock. He had now no doubt that the cave was watched, and that it was one of his late purſuers whoſe ſhade he had ſeen. He returned, therefore, to Julia, and remained near an hour hid in the deepeſt receſs of the rock; when, no ſound having interrupted the profound ſilence of the place, he at length once more ventured to the mouth of the cave. Again be threw a fearful look around, but diſcerned no human form. The ſoft moon-beam ſtept upon the dewy landſcape, and the ſolemn ſtillneſs of midnight wrapt the world. Fear heightened to the fugitives the ſublimity of the hour. Ferdinand now led Julia forth, and they paſſed ſilently along the ſhelving foot of the rocks.</p>
               <p>They continued their way without farther inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; and among the cliffs at ſome diſtance from the cave, diſcovered to their inexpreſſible joy their horſes, who having broken their faſtenings, had ſtrayed thither, and had now laid themſelves down to reſt. Ferdinand and Julia immediately mounted; and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending to the plains, took the road that led to a ſmall-ſea port at ſome leagues diſtance, whence they could embark for Italy.</p>
               <p>They travelled for ſome hours through gloomy foreſts of beech and cheſnut; and their way was only faintly illuminated by the moon, which ſhed a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling luſtre through the dark foliage, and which was ſeen but at intervals, as the paſſing clouds yielded to the power of her rays. They reached at length the

                  </gap>kirts of the foreſt. The grey dawn now appeared, and the chill morning air bit ſhrewdly. It was with inexpreſſible joy that Julia obſerved the kindling at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere; and ſoon after the rays of the riſing ſun touching the tops of the mountains, whoſe ſides were yet involved in dark vapours.</p>
               <p>Her fears diſſipated with the darkneſs. The ſun now appeared amid clouds of inconceivable ſplendour; and unveiled a ſcene which in other circumſtances Julia would have contemplated with rapture. From the ſide of the hill, down which they were winding, a vale appeared, from whence aroſe wild and lofty mountains, whoſe ſides were cloathed with hanging woods, except where here and there a precipice projected its bold and rugged front. Here a few half withered trees hung from the crevices of the rock, and gave a pictureſque wildneſs to the object; there cluſters of half ſeen cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, riſing from among tufted groves, embelliſhed the green margin of a ſtream which meandered in the bottom, and bore its waves to the blue and diſtant mai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The freſhneſs of morning breathed over the ſcene, and vivified each colour of the landſcape. The bright dew drops hung trembling from the branches of the trees, which at intervals oveſhadowed the road; and the ſprightly muſic of the birds ſaluted the riſing day. Notwithſtanding her anxiety, the ſcene diffuſed a ſoft complacency over the mind of Julia.</p>
               <p>About noon they reached the port, where Ferdinand was fortunate enough to obtain a ſmall veſſel; but the wind was unfavourable, and it was paſt midnight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was poſſible for them to embark.</p>
               <p>When the dawn appeared, Julia returned to the deck; and viewed with a ſigh of unaccountable regret, the receding coaſt of Sicily. But ſhe obſerved with high admiration, the light gradually ſpreading through
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:029381_0175_0FE0D52F2C2C9800"/>
the atmoſphere, darting a feeble ray over the ſurface of the waters, which rolled in ſolemn ſoundings upon the diſtant ſhores. Fiery beams now marked the clouds, and the eaſt glowed with encreaſing radiance, till the ſun roſe at once above the waves, and illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating them with a flood of ſplendour, diffuſed gaiety and gladneſs around. The bold concave of the heavens, uniting with the vaſt expanſe of the ocean, formed a <hi>coup d'oeil,</hi> ſtriking and ſublime. The mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence of the ſcenery inſpired Julia with delight; and her heart dilating with high enthuſiaſm, ſhe forgot the ſorrows which had oppreſſed her.</p>
               <p>The breeze waſted the ſhip gently along for ſome hours, when it gradually ſunk into a calm. The glaffy ſurface of the waters was not curled by the lighteſt air, and the veſſel floated heavily on the boſom of the deep. Sicily was yet in view, and the preſent delay agitated Julia with wild apprehenſion. Towards the cloſe of day a light breeze ſprang up, but it blew from Italy, and a train of dark vapours emerged from the verge of the horizon, which gradually accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating, the heavens became entirely overcaſt. The evening ſhut in ſuddenly: the riſing wind, the heavy clouds that loaded the atmoſphere, and the thunder which murmured afar off, terrified Julia, and threatened a violent ſtorm.</p>
               <p>The tempeſt came on, and the captain vainly ſounded for anchorage: it was deep ſea, and the veſſel drove furiouſly before the wind. The darkneſs was interrupted only at intervals, by the broad expanſe of vivid lightnings, which quivered upon the waters, and diſcloſing the horrible gaſpings of the waves, ſerved to render the ſucceeding darkneſs more awful. The thunder which burſt in tremendous craſhes above, the loud roar of the waves below, the noiſe of the ſailors,
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:029381_0176_0FE0D537B3BDA2D0"/>
and the ſudden cracks and groanings of the veſſel, conſpired to heighten the tremendous ſublimity of the ſcene.</p>
               <l>Far on the rocky ſhores the ſurges ſound,</l>
               <l>The laſhing whirlwinds cleave the vaſt profound;</l>

               <p>Julia lay fainting with terror and ſickneſs in the cabin, and Ferdinand though almoſt hopeleſs himſelf, was endeavouring to ſupport her, when a loud and dreadful craſh was heard from above. It ſeemed as if the whole veſſel had parted. The voices of the ſailors now roſe together, and all was confuſion and uproar. Ferdinand ran up to the deck, and learned that the main maſt, borne away by the wind, had fallen upon the deck, whence it had rolled overboard.</p>
               <p>It was now paſt midnight, and the ſtorm continued with unabated f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For hours the veſſel had been driven before the blaſt; and the captain now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring it was impoſſible ſhe could weather the tempeſt much longer, ordered the long boat to be in readineſs. His orders were ſcarcely executed, when the ſhip bulged upon a reef of rocks, and the impetuous waves ruſhed into the veſſel:—a general groan enſued. Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand flew to ſave his ſiſter, whom he carried to the boat, which was nearly filled by the captain and moſt of the crew. The ſea ran ſo high that it appeared impracticable to reach the ſhore; but the boat had not moved many yards, when the ſhip went to pieces. The captain now perceived by the flaſhes of lightning, a high rocky coaſt at about the diſtance of half a mile. The men ſtruggled hard at the oars; but almoſt as often as they gained the ſummit or a wave, it daſhed them back again, and made the labour <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="178" facs="unknown:029381_0177_0FE0D53C4BC67338"/>After much difficulty and fatigue they reached the coaſt, where a new danger preſented itſelf. They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held a wild rocky ſhore, whoſe cliffs appeared inacceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and which ſeemed to afford little poſſibility of landing. A landing, however was at laſt effected; and the ſailors, after much ſearch, diſcovered a kind of path-way cut in the rock, which they all aſcended in ſafety.</p>
               <p>The dawn now faintly glimmered, and they ſurveyed the coaſt, but could diſcover no human habitation. They imagined they were on the ſhores of Sicily, but poſſeſſed no means of confirming this conjecture. Terror, ſickneſs, and fatigue had ſubdued the ſtrength and ſpirit of Julia, and ſhe was obliged to reſt upon the rocks.</p>
               <p>The ſtorm now ſuddenly ſubſided, and the total calm which ſuccceded to the wild tumult of the winds and waves, produced a ſtriking and ſublime effect. The air was huſhed into a deathlike ſtillneſs, but the waves were yet violently agitated; and by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing light, parts of the wreck were ſeen floating wide upon the face of the deep. Some ſailors who had miſſed the boat were alſo diſcovered clinging to pieces of the veſſel, and making towards the ſhore. On obſerving this, their ſhipmates immediately deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended to the boat; and putting off to ſea, reſcued them from their perilous ſituation. When Julia was ſomewhat re-animated, they proceeded up the country in ſearch of a dwelling.</p>
               <p>They had travelled near half a league, when the ſavage features of the country began to ſoften, and gradually changed to the pictureſque beauty of Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian ſcenery. They now diſcovered at ſome diſtance a villa, ſeated on a gentle eminence crowned with woods.
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:029381_0178_0FE0D5422043CFB8"/>
It was the firſt human habitation they had ſeen ſince they embarked for Italy; and Julia, who was almoſt ſinking with fatigue, beheld it with delight. The captain and his men haſtened towards it to make known their diſtreſs, while Ferdinand and Julia ſlowly followed. They obſerved the men enter the villa, one of whom quickly returned to acquaint them with the hoſpitable reception his comrades had received.</p>
               <p>Julia with difficulty reached the edifice, at the door of which ſhe was met by a young cavalier, whoſe pleaſing and intellige<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>vour. He welcomed the ſtrangers with a benevolent politeneſs, that diſſolved at once every uncomfortable feeling which their ſituation had excited, and produced an inſtantaneous eaſy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence. Through a light and elegant hall, riſing into a dome, ſupported by pillars of white marble, and adorned with buſts; he led them to a magnificent veſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bule, which opened upon a lawn. Having ſeated them at a table ſpread with refreſhments; he left them, and they ſurveyed with ſurpriſe, the beauty of the adjacent ſcene.</p>
               <p>The lawn, which was on each ſide bounded by hanging woods, deſcended in gentle declivity to a fine lake, whoſe ſmooth ſurface reflected the ſurrounding ſhades. Beyond appeared the diſtant country, riſing on the left into bold romantic mountains, and on the right, exhibiting a ſoft and glowing landſcape, whoſe tranquil beauty formed a ſtriking contraſt to the wild ſublimity of the oppoſite craggy heights. The blue and diſtant ocean terminated the view.</p>
               <p>In a ſhort time the cavalier returned, conducting two ladies of a very engaging appearance, whom he preſented as his wife and ſiſter. They welcomed Julia
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:029381_0179_0FE0D547A6765810"/>
with graceful kindneſs; but fatigue ſoon obliged her to retire to reſt, and a conſequent indiſpoſition en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed ſo rapidly, as to render it impracticable for her to quit her preſent abode on that day. The cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and his men proceeded on their way, leaving Ferdinand and Julia at the villa, where ſhe experienced every kind and tender affection.</p>
               <p>The day which was to have devoted Julia to a cloiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, was uſhered in at the abbey with the uſual cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. The church was ornamented, and all the inhabitants of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The hour of celebration arrived, and he entered the church with a proud firm ſtep, and with a countenance which depictured his inward triumph; he was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding to the high altar, when he was told that Julia was no where to be found. Aſtoniſhment for a while ſuſpended other emotions,—he yet believed it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that ſhe could have effected an eſcape, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered every part of the abbey to be ſearched—not forgetting the ſecret caverns belonging to the monaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, which wound beneath the woods. When the ſearch was over, and he became convinced ſhe was fled; the deep workings of his diſappointed paſſions fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented into rage which exceeded all bounds. He denounced the moſt terrible judgments upon Julia; and calling for Madame de Menon, charged her with having inſulting her holy religion, in being acceſſary to the flight of Julia. Madame endured theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches with calm dignity, and preſerved a ſteady ſilence; but ſhe ſecretly determined to leave the
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:029381_0180_0FE0D54B4D5CE9E8"/>
monaſtery, and ſeek in another, the repoſe which ſhe could never hope to find in this.</p>
               <p>The report of Julia's diſappearance ſpread rapidly beyond the walls, and ſoon reached the ears of the marquis, who rejoiced in the circumſtance, believing that ſhe muſt now inevitably fall into his hands.</p>
               <p>After his people, in obedience to his orders, had carefully ſearched the ſurrounding woods and rocks, he withdrew them from the abbey; and having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed them various ways in ſearch of Julia, he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the caſtle of Mazzini. Here new vexation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waited him, for he now firſt learned that Ferdinand had eſcaped from confinement.</p>
               <p>The myſtery of Julia's flight was now reſolved; for it was evident by whoſe means ſhe had effected it, and the marquis iſſued orders to his people to ſecure Ferdinand wherever he ſhould be found.</p>

               <p>HIPPOLITUS, who had languiſhed under a long and dangerous illneſs produced by his wounds, but heightened and prolonged by the diſtreſs of his mind, was detained in a ſmall town on the coaſts of Calabria, and was yet ignorant of the death of Cornelia. He ſcarcely doubted that Julia was now devoted to the duke, and this thought was at times poiſon to his heart. After his arrival in Calabria, immediately on the recovery of his ſenſes, he diſpatched a ſervant back to the caſtle of Mazzini, to gain ſecret intelligence of what had paſſed after his departure. The eagerneſs with which we endeavour to eſcape from miſery,
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:029381_0181_0FE0D551A2599440"/>
taught him to encourage a remote and romantic hope, that Julia yet lived for him. Yet even this hope at length languiſhed into deſpair, as the time elapſed which ſhould have brought his ſervant from Sicily. Days and weeks paſſed away in the utmoſt anxiety to Hippolitus, for ſtill his emiſſary did not appear; and at laſt, concluding that he had been either ſeized by rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, or diſcovered and detained by the marquis, the count ſent off a ſecond emiſſary to the caſtle of Maz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zini. By him he learned the news of Julia's flight, and his heart dilated with joy; but it was ſuddenly checked, when he heard the marquis had diſcovered her retreat in the abbey of St. Auguſtin. The wounds which ſtill detained him in confinement now became intolerable. Julia might yet be loſt to him for ever. But even his preſent ſtate of fear and uncertainty was bliſs compared with the anguiſh of deſpair, which his mind had long endured.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as he was ſufficiently recovered, he quitted Italy for Sicily, in the deſign of viſiting the monaſtery of St. Auguſtin, where it was poſſible Julia might yet remain. That he might paſs with the ſecrecy neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to his plan, and eſcape the attacks of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis, he left his ſervants in Calabria and embarked alone.</p>
               <p>It was morning when he landed at ſmall port of Sicily, and proceeded towards the abbey of St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin. As he travelled, his imagination revolved the ſcenes of his early love, the diſtreſs of Julia, and the ſufferings of Ferdinand, and his heart melted at the retroſpect. He conſidered the probabilities of Julia's having found protection from her father in the pity of the <hi>Padre Abate;</hi> and even ventured to indulge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a flattering, fond anticipation of the moment, when Julia ſhould again be reſtored to his ſight.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="unknown:029381_0182_0FE0D555A13CE170"/>He arrived at the monaſtery, and his grief may eaſily be imagined, when he was informed of the death of his beloved ſiſter, and of the flight of Julia. He quitted St. Auguſtin's immediately, without even knowing that Madame de Menon was there, and ſat out for a town at ſome leagues diſtance, where he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to paſs the night.</p>
               <p>Abſorbed in the melancholy reflexions which the late intelligence excited, he gave the reins to his horſe, and journeyed on unmindful of his way. The even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was far advanced, when he diſcovered that he had taken a wrong direction, and that he was bewildered in a wild and ſolitary ſcene. He had wandered too far from the road to hope to regain it, and he had beſide no recollection of the objects left behind him. A choice of errors only, lay before him. The view on his right hand exhibited high and ſavage mountains, covered with heath and black fir; and the wild deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of their aſpect, together with the dangerous ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the path that wound up their ſides, and which was the only apparent track they afforded, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined Hippolitus not to attempt their aſcent. On his left lay a foreſt, to which the path he was then in led; its appearance was gloomy, but he preferred it to the mountains; and ſince he was uncertain of its extent, there was a poſſibility that he might paſs it, and reach a village before the night was ſet in.—At the worſt, the foreſt would afford him a ſhelter from the winds; and however he might be bewildered in its labyrinths, he could aſcend a tree, and reſt in ſecurity till the return of light ſhould afford him an opportunity of extricating himſelf. Among the mountains there was no poſſibility of meeting with other ſhelter than what the habitation of man afforded, and ſuch a ſhelter there was little probability of finding. Innumerable dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:029381_0183_0FE0D55C29D3C768"/>
alſo threatened him here, from which he would be ſecure on level ground.</p>
               <p>Having determined which way to purſue, he puſhed his horſe into a gallop, and entered the foreſt as the laſt rays of the ſun trembled on the mountains. The thick foliage of the trees threw a gloom around, which was every moment deepened by the ſhades of evening. The path was uninterrupted, and the count continued to purſue it till all diſtinction was confounded in the veil of night. Total darkneſs now made it impoſſible for him to purſue his way. He diſmounted, and faſtening his horſe to a tree, climbed among the branches, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing to remain there till morning.</p>
               <p>He had not been long in this ſituation, when a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed ſound of voices from a diſtance rouſed his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The ſound returned at intervals for ſome time, but without ſeeming to approach. He deſcended from the tree, that he might the better judge of the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whence it came; but before he reached the ground, the noiſe was ceaſed, and all was profoundly ſilent. He continued to liſten, but the ſilence remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing undiſturbed, he began to think he had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the ſinging of the wind among the leaves; and was preparing to re-aſcend, when he perceived a faint light glimmer through the foliage from afar. The ſight revived a hope that he was near ſome place of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man habitation; he therefore unfaſtened his horſe, and led him towards the ſpot whence the ray iſſued. The moon was now riſen, and threw a checquered gleam over his path ſufficient to direct him.</p>
               <p>Before he had proceeded far, the light diſappeared. He continued however his way as nearly as he could gueſs, towards the place whence it had iſſued; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter much toil, found himſelf in a ſpot where the trees formed a circle round a kind of rude lawn. The
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:029381_0184_0FE0D56195519C70"/>
moonlight diſcovered to him an edifice which appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have been formerly a monaſtery, but which now exhibited a pile of ruins, whoſe grandeur, heightened by decay, touched the beholder with reverential awe. Hippolitus pauſed to gaze upon the ſcene; the ſacred ſtillneſs of night encreaſed its effect, and a ſecret dread, he knew not wherefore, ſtole upon his heart.</p>
               <p>The ſilence and the character of the place made him doubt whether this was the ſpot he had been ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and as he ſtood heſitating whether to proceed or to return, he obſerved a figure ſtanding under an arch-way of the ruin; it carried a light in its hand, and paſſing ſilently along, diſappeared in a remote part of the building. The courage of Hippolitus for a moment deſerted him. An invincible curioſity, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſubdued his terror, and he determined to purſue, if poſſible, the way the figure had taken.</p>
               <p>He paſſed over looſe ſtones through a ſort of court, till he came to the arch-way; here he ſtopped, for fear returned upon him. Reſuming his courage, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he went on, ſtill endeavouring to follow the way the figure had paſſed, and ſuddenly found himſelf in an encloſed part of the ruin, whoſe appearance was more wild and deſolate than any he had yet ſeen. Seized with unconquerable apprehenſion, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring, when the low voice of a diſtreſſed perſon ſtruck his ear. His heart ſunk at the ſound, his limbs trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and he was utterly unable to move.</p>
               <p>The ſound which appeared to be the laſt groan of a dying perſon, was repeated. Hippolitus made a ſtrong effort, and ſprang forward, when a light burſt upon him from a ſhattered caſement of the building, and at the ſame inſtant he heard the voices of men!</p>
               <p>He advanced ſoftly to the window, and beheld in a
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:029381_0185_0FE0D5670D27EF68"/>
ſmall room, which was leſs decayed than the reſt of the edifice, a group of men, who from the ſavageneſs of their looks, and from their dreſs, appeared to be ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditti. They ſurrounded a man who lay on the ground wounded, and bathed in blood, and who it was very evident had uttered the groans heard by the count.</p>
               <p>The obſcurity of the place prevented Hippolitus from diſtinguiſhing the features of the dying man. From the blood which covered him, and from the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding circumſtances, he appeared to be murdered; and the count had no doubt that the men he beheld were the murderers. The horror of the ſcene entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly overcame him; he ſtood rooted to the ſpot, and ſaw the aſſaſſins rifle the pockets of the dying perſon, who in a voice ſcarcely articulate, but which deſpair ſeemed to aid, ſupplicated for mercy. The ruffians anſwered him only with execrations, and continued their plunder. His groans and his ſufferings ſerved only to aggravate their cruelty. They were proceeding to take from him a miniature picture, which was faſtened round his neck, and had been hitherto concealed in his boſom; when by a ſudden effort he half raiſed himſelf from the ground, and attempted to ſave it from their hands. The effort availed him nothing; a blow from one of the villains laid the unfortunate man on the floor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out motion. The horrid barbarity of the act ſeized the mind of Hippolitus ſo entirely, that forgetful of his own ſituation, he groaned aloud, and ſtarted with an inſtantaneous deſign of avenging the deed. The noiſe he made alarmed the banditti, who looking whence it came, diſcovered the count through the caſement. They inſtantly quitted their prize, and ruſhed towards the door of the room. He was now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to a ſenſe of his danger, and endeavoured to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:029381_0186_0FE0D56B30579858"/>
to the exterior part of the ruin; but terror be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wildered his ſenſes, and he miſtook his way. Inſtead of regaining the arch-way, he perplexed himſelf with fruitleſs wanderings, and at length found himſelf only more deeply involved in the ſecret receſſes of the pile.</p>
               <p>The ſteps of his purſuers gained faſt upon him, and he continued to perplex himſelf with vain efforts at eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, till at length, quite exhauſted, he ſunk on the ground, and endeavoured to reſign himſelf to his fate. He liſtened with a kind of ſtern deſpair, and was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed to find all ſilent. On looking round, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by a ray of moon-light which ſtreamed through a part of the ruin from above, that he was in a ſort of vault, which, from the ſmall means he had of judging, he thought was extenſive.</p>
               <p>In this ſituation he remained for a conſiderable time, ruminating on the means of eſcape, yet ſcarcely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving eſcape was poſſible. If he continued in the vault, he might continue there only to be butchered; but by attempting to reſcue himſelf from the place he was now in, he muſt ruſh into the hands of the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditti. Judging it, therefore, the ſafer way of the two to remain where he was, he endeavoured to await his fate with fortitude, when ſuddenly the loud voices of the murderers burſt upon his ear, and he heard ſteps advancing quickly towards the ſpot where he lay.</p>
               <p>Deſpair inſtantly renewed his vigour; he ſtarted from the ground, and throwing round him a look of eager deſperation, his eye caught the glimpſe of a ſmall door, upon which the moon-beam now fell. He made towards it, and paſſed it juſt as the light of a torch gleamed upon the walls of the vault.</p>
               <p>He groped his way along a winding paſſage, and at length came to a flight of ſteps. Notwithſtanding the darkneſs, he reached the bottom in ſafety.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="188" facs="unknown:029381_0187_0FE0D571A2CE5EB0"/>He now for the firſt time ſtopped to liſten—the ſounds of purſuit were ceaſed, and all was ſilent! Continuing to wander on in ineffectual endeavours to eſcape, his hands at length touched cold iron, and he quickly perceived it belonged to a door. The door however was faſtened, and reſiſted all his efforts to open it. He was giving up the attempt in deſpair, when a loud ſcream from within, followed by a dead and heavy noiſe, rouſed all his attention. Silence en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued. He liſtened for a conſiderable time at the door, his imagination filled with images of horror, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting to hear the ſound repeated. He ſought for a decayed part of the door, through which he might diſcover what was beyond; but he could find none; and after waiting ſome time without hearing any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther noiſe, he was quitting the ſpot, when in paſſing his arm over the door, it ſtruck againſt ſomething hard. On examination he perceived to his extreme ſurpriſe that the key was in the lock. For a moment he heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated what to do; but curioſity overcame other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, and with a trembling hand he turned the key. The door opened into a large and deſolate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, dimly lighted by a lamp that ſtood on a table, which was almoſt the only furniture of the place. The count had not advanced ſeveral ſteps before he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an object, which fixed all his attention. This was the figure of a young woman lying on the floor appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently dead. Her face was concealed in her robe; and the long auburn treſſes which fell in beautiful luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance over her boſom, ſerved to veil a part of the glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beauty which the diſorder of her dreſs would have revealed.</p>
               <p>Pity, ſurpriſe, and admiration ſtruggled in the breaſt of Hippolitus; and while he ſtood ſurveying the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject which excited theſe different emotions, he heard a
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:029381_0188_0FE0D576DDE97C68"/>
ſtep advancing towards the room. He flew to the door by which he had entered, and was fortunate enough to reach it before the entrance of the perſons whoſe ſteps he heard. Having turned the key, he ſtopped at the door to liſten to their proceedings. He diſtinguiſhed the voices of two men, and knew them to be thoſe of the aſſaſſins. Preſently he heard a piercing ſhriek, and at the ſame inſtant the voices of the ruffians grow loud and violent. One of them exclaimed that the lady was dying, and accuſed the other of having frightened her to death, ſwearing with horrid imprecations that ſhe was his, and he would defend her to the laſt drop of his blood. The diſpute grew higher; and neither of the ruffians would give up his claim to the unfortunate object of their altercation.</p>
               <p>The claſhing of ſwords was ſoon after heard, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a violent noiſe. The ſcreams were repeated, and the oaths and execrations of the diſputants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled. They ſeemed to move towards the door, behind which Hippolitus was concealed; ſuddenly the door was ſhook with great force, a deep groan followed, and was inſtantly ſucceeded by a noiſe like that of a perſon whoſe whole weight falls at once to the ground. For a moment all was ſilent. Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litus had no doubt that one of the ruffians had deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troyed the other, and was ſoon confirmed in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief—for the ſurvivor triumphed with brutal exultation over his fallen antagoniſt. The ruffian haſtily quitted the room, and Hippolitus ſoon after heard the diſtant voices of ſeveral perſons in loud diſpute. The ſounds ſeemed to come from a chamber over the place where he ſtood; he alſo heard a trampling of feet from above, and could even diſtinguiſh, at intervals, the words of the diſputants. From theſe he gathered enough to learn that the affray which had juſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:029381_0189_0FE0D3679490CD10"/>
and the lady who had been the occaſion of it, were the ſubjects of diſcourſe. The voices frequently roſe together, and confounded all diſtinction.</p>
               <p>At length the tumult began to ſubſide, and Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litus could diſtinguiſh what was ſaid. The ruffians agreed to give up the lady in queſtion to him who had fought for her; and leaving him to his prize, they all went out in queſt of farther prey. The ſituation of the unfortunate lady excited a mixture of pity and indignation in Hippolitus, which for ſome time en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely occupied him; he revolved the means of ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating her from ſo deplorable a ſituation, and in theſe thoughts almoſt forgot his own danger. He now heard her ſighs; and while his heart melted to the ſounds, the farther door of the apartment was thrown open, and the wretch to whom ſhe had been allotted, ruſhed in. Her ſcreams now redoubled, but they were of no avail with the ruffian who had ſeized her in his arms; when the count, who was unarmed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible to every impulſe but that of a generous pity, burſt into the room, but became fixed like a ſtatue when he beheld his Julia ſtruggling in the graſp of the ruffian. On diſcovering Hippolitus, ſhe made a ſudden ſpring, and liberated herſelf; when, running to him, ſhe ſunk lifeleſs in his arms.</p>
               <p>Surpriſe and fury ſparkled in the eyes of the ruffian, and he turned with a ſavage deſperation upon the count; who, relinquiſhing Julia, ſnatched up the ſword of the dead ruffian, which lay upon the floor, and defended himſelf. The combat was furious, but Hippolitus laid his antagoniſt ſenſeleſs at his feet. He flew to Julia, who now revived, but who for ſome time could ſpeak only by her tears. The tranſitions of various and rapid ſenſations, which her heart experienced, and the ſtrangely mingled emotions of joy and terror that
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:029381_0190_0FE0D582CFA09470"/>
agitated Hippolitus, can only be underſtood by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. He raiſed her from the floor, and endeavoured to ſoothe her to compoſure, when ſhe called wildly upon Ferdinand. At his name the count ſtarted, and inſtantly remembered the dying cavalier, whoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance the glooms had concealed from his view. His heart thrilled with ſecret agony, yet he reſolved to withhold his terrible conjectures from Julia, of whom he learned that Ferdinand, with herſelf, had been taken by banditti in the way from the villa which had offered them ſo hoſpitable a reception after the ſhip-wreck. They were on the road to a port whence they deſigned again to embark for Italy, when this misfortune over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took them. Julia added that Ferdinand had been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſeparated from her; and that, for ſome hours, ſhe had been confined in the apartment where Hippolitus found her. The count with difficulty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed his terrible apprehenſions for Ferdinand, and vainly ſtrove to ſoften Julia's diſtreſs. But there was no time to be loſt—they had yet to find a way out of the edifice, and before they could accompliſh this, the banditti might return. It was alſo poſſible that ſome of the party were left to watch this their abode during the abſence of the reſt, and this was another circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of reaſonable alarm.</p>
               <p>After ſome little conſideration, Hippolitus judged it moſt prudent to ſeek an outlet through the paſſage by which he entered; he therefore took the lamp, and led Julia to the door. They entered the avenue, and locking the door after them, ſought the flight of ſteps down which the count had before paſſed; but having purſued the windings of the avenue a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time without finding them, he became certain he had miſtaken the way. They, however, found ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther flight, which they deſcended, and entered upon
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:029381_0191_0FE0D58839C17A08"/>
a paſſage ſo very narrow and low, as not to admit of a perſon walking upright. This paſſage was cloſed by a door, which on examination was found to be chiefly of iron. Hippolitus was ſtartled at the ſight, but on applying his ſtrength found it gradually yield, when the impriſoned air ruſhed out, and had nearly extinguiſhed the light. They now entered upon a dark abyſs; and the door which moved upon a ſpring, ſuddenly cloſed upon them. On looking around they beheld a large vault<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it is not eaſy to imagine their horror on diſcovering they were in a receptacle for the murdered bodies of the unfortunate people who had fallen into the hands of the banditti.</p>
               <p>The count could ſcarcely ſupport the fainting ſpirits of Julia; he ran to the door which he endeavoured to open, but the lock are ſo conſtructed that it could be moved only on the other ſide, and all his efforts were uſeleſs. He was conſtrained, therefore, to ſeek for another door, but could find none. Their ſituation was the moſt deplorable that can be imagined: for they were now incloſed in a vault ſtr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="193" facs="unknown:029381_0192_0FE0D58FEC79F0C8"/>The noiſe increaſed, and they could diſtinguiſh voices. Hippolitus believed the murderers were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned; that they had traced his retreat, and were coming towards the vault by ſome way unknown to him. He prepared for the worſt—and drawing his ſword, reſolved to defend Julia to the laſt. Their apprehenſion, however, was ſoon diſſipated by a tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling of horſes, which ſound had occaſioned his alarm, and which now ſeemed to come from a court-yard above, extremely near the vault. He diſtinctly heard the voices of the banditti, together with the moans and ſupplications of ſome perſon, whom it was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent they were about to plunder. The ſound ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſo very near, that Hippolitus was both ſhocked and ſurpriſed; and looking round the vault, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a ſmall grated window placed very high in the wall, which he concluded overlooked the place where the robbers were aſſembled. He recollected that his light might betray him; and horrible as was the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternative, he was compelled to extinguiſh it. He now attempted to climb to the grate, through which he might obtain a view of what was paſſing without. This at length he effected, for the ruggedneſs of the wall afforded him a footing. He beheld in a ruinous court, which was partially illuminated by the glare of torches, a group of banditti ſurrounding two perſons who were bound on horſe-back, and who were ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating for mercy.</p>
               <p>One of the robbers exclaiming with an oath that this was a golden night, bade his comrades diſpatch, add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he would go to find Paulo and the lady.</p>
               <p>The effect which the latter part of this ſentence had upon the priſoners in the vault, may be more eaſily imagined than deſcribed. They were now in total darkneſs in this manſion of the murdered, without
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:029381_0193_0FE0D594CB87A900"/>
means of eſcape, and in momentary expectation of ſharing a fate ſimilar to that of the wretched objects around them. Julia overcome with diſtreſs and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, ſunk on the ground; and Hippolitus, deſcending from the grate, became inſenſible of his own danger in his apprehenſion for her.</p>
               <p>In a ſhort time all without was confuſion and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar; the ruffian who had left the court returned with the alarm that the lady was fled, and that Paulo was murdered. The robbers quitted their booty to go in ſearch of the fugitive, and to diſcover the murderer, dreadful vociferations reſounded through every receſs of the pile.</p>
               <p>The tumult had continued a conſiderable time, which the priſoners had paſſed in a ſtate of horrible ſuſpence, when they heard the uproar advancing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the vault, and ſoon after a number of voices ſhouted down the avenue. The ſound of ſteps quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened. Hippolitus again drew his ſword, and placed himſelf oppoſite the entrance, where he had not ſtood long, when a violent puſh was made againſt the door; it flew open, and a party of men ruſhed into the vault.</p>
               <p>Hippolitus kept his poſition, proteſting he would deſtroy the firſt who approached. At the ſound of his voice they ſtopped; but preſently advancing, commanded him in the king's name to ſurrender. He now diſcovered what his agitation had prevented hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> from obſerving ſooner, that the men, before him were not banditti, but the officers of juſtice. They had received information of this haunt of villainy from the ſon of a Sicilian nobleman, who had fallen into the hands of this banditti and had afterwards eſcaped from from their power.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="195" facs="unknown:029381_0194_0FE0D598B24C4FF0"/>The officers came attended by a guard, and were every way prepared to proſecute a ſtrenuous ſearch through theſe horrible receſſes.</p>
               <p>Hippolitus inquired for Ferdinand, and they all quitted the vault in ſearch of him. In the court, to which they now aſcended, the greater part of the banditti were ſecured by a number of the guard. The count accuſed the robbers of having ſecreted his friend, whom he deſcribed, and demanded to have liberated.</p>
               <p>With one voice they denied the fact, and were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute in perſiſting that they knew nothing of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon deſcribed. This denial confirmed Hippolitus in his former terrible ſurmiſe; that the dying cavalier whom he had ſeen, was no other than Ferdinand, and he became furious. He bade the officers proſecute their ſearch, who, leaving a guard over the banditti they had ſecured, followed him to the room, where the late dreadful ſcene had been acted.</p>
               <p>The room was dark and empty, but the traces of blood were viſible on the floor; and Julia, though ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the particular apprehenſion of Hippolitus, almoſt ſwooned at the ſight. On quitting the room, they wandered for ſome time among the ruins, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſcovering any thing extraordinary, till, in paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the arch-way by which Hippolitus had firſt entered the ruins, their footſteps returned a deep ſound, which convinced them that the ground beneath was hollow. On cloſe examination, they perceived by the light of their torch, a trap-door, which with ſome difficulty they lifted, and diſcoveved beyond a narrow flight of ſteps. They all deſcended into a low winding paſſage, where they had not been long, when they heard a trampling of horſes above, and a loud and ſudden uproar.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="196" facs="unknown:029381_0195_0FE0D59EF2E38EB0"/>The officers apprehending that the banditti had overcome the guard, ruſhed back to the trap-door<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which they had ſcarcely lifted, when they heard a claſhing of ſwords, and a confuſion of unknown voices. Looking onward, they beheld through the arch, in an inner ſort of court, a large party of banditti who were juſt arrived, reſcuing their comrades, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending furiouſly with the guard.</p>
               <p>On obſerving this, ſeveral of the officers ſprang for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the aſſiſtance of their friends; and the reſt, ſubdued by cowardice, hurried down the ſteps, letting the trap door fall after them with a thundering noiſe. They gave notice to Hippolitus of what was paſſing above, who hurried Julia along the paſſage in ſearch of ſome outlet o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Deſpair gave ſtrength to Julia, and winged her flight. But they were now ſtopped by a door which cloſed the paſſage, and the ſound of diſtant voices murmured along the walls.</p>
               <p>The door was faſtened by ſtrong iron bolts, which Hippolitus vainly endeavoured to draw. The voices drew near. After much labour and difficulty the bolts yielded—the door uncloſed—and light dawned upon them through the mouth of a cave, into which they now entered. On quitting the cave they found themſelves in the foreſt, and in a ſhort time reached the borders. They now ventured to ſtop, and looking back perceived no perſon in purſuit.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
               <p>WHEN Julia had reſted, they followed the track before them, and in a ſhort time arrived at a village where they obtained ſecurity and refreſhment.</p>
               <p>But Julia, whoſe mind was occupied with dreadful anxiety concerning Ferdinand, became indifferent to all around her. Even the preſence of Hippolitus, which but lately would have raiſed her from miſery to joy, failed to ſoothe her diſtreſs. The ſteady and noble attachment of her brother had ſunk deep in her heart, and reflexion only aggravated her affliction. Yet the banditti had ſteadily perſiſted in affirming that he was not concealed in their receſſes; and this circumſtance, which threw a deeper ſhade over the fears of Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litus, imparted a glimmering of hope to the mind of Julia.</p>
               <p>A more immediate intereſt at length forced her mind from this ſorrowful ſubject. It was neceſſary to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine upon ſome line of conduct, for ſhe was now in an unknown ſpot, and ignorant of any place of refuge. The count, who trembled at the dangers which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed her, and at the probabilities he ſaw of her being torn from him for ever, ſuffered a conſideration of them to overcome the dangerous delicacy which at this mournful period required his ſilence. He entreated her to deſtroy the poſſibility of ſeparation, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to become his immediately. He urged that a prieſt could be eaſily procured from a neighbouring convent, who would confirm the bonds which had ſo long united their hearts, and who would thus at once arreſt the deſtiny that ſo long had threatened his hopes.</p>
               <p>This propoſal, though ſimilar to the one ſhe had before accepted; and though the certain means of
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:029381_0197_0FE0D5A96A7F6500"/>
reſcuing her from the fate ſhe dreaded, ſhe now turned from in ſorrow and dejection. She loved Hippolitus with a ſteady and tender affection, which was ſtill heightened by the gratitude he claimed as her deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer; but ſhe conſidered it a prophanation of the memory of that brother who had ſuffered ſo much for her ſake, to mingle joy with the grief which her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> concerning him occaſioned. She ſoftened her refuſal with a tender grace, that quickly diſſipated the jealous doubt ariſing in the mind of Hippolitus, and encreaſed his fond admiration of her character.</p>
               <p>She deſired to retire for a time to ſome obſcure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, there to await the iſſue of the event, which at preſent involved her in perplexity and ſorrow.</p>
               <p>Hippolitus ſtruggled with his feelings and forbore to preſs farther the ſuit on which his happineſs, and almoſt his exiſtence now depended. He inquired at the village for a neighbouring convent, and was told that there was none within twelve leagues, but that near the town of Palini, at about that diſtance, were two. He procured horſes, and leaving the officers to return to Palermo for a ſtronger guard, he, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by Julia, entered on the road to Palini.</p>
               <p>Julia was ſilent and thoughtful; Hippolitus gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually ſunk into the ſame mood, and he often caſt a cautious look around as they travelled for ſome hours along the foot of the mountains. They ſtopped to dine under the ſhade of ſome beech trees; for, fearful of diſcovery, Hippolitus had provided againſt the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of entering many inns. Having finiſhed their repaſt, they purſued their journey; but Hippolitus now began to doubt whether he was in the right direction. Being deſtitute, however, of the means of certainty upon this point, he followed the road before him, which now wound up the ſide of a ſteep hill, whence
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:029381_0198_0FE0D5AD73FAC728"/>
they deſcended into a rich valley, where the ſhepherd's pipe ſounded ſweetly from afar among the hills. The evening ſun ſhed a mild and mellow luſtre over the landſcape, and ſoftened each feature with a vermil glow that would have inſpired a mind leſs occupied than Julia's, with ſenſations of congenial tranquillity.</p>
               <p>The evening now cloſed in; and as they were doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of the road, and ſound it would be impoſſible to reach Palini that night, they took the way to a village, which they perceived at the extremity of the valley.</p>
               <p>They had proceeded about half a mile, when they heard a ſudden ſhout of voices echoed from among the hills behind them; and looking back, perceived faintly through the duſk a party of men on horſeback making towards them. As they drew nearer, the words they ſpoke were diſtinguiſhable, and Julia heard her own name ſounded. Shocked at this circumſtance, ſhe had now no doubt that ſhe was diſcovered by a party of her father's people, and ſhe ſted with Hippolitus along the valley. The purſuers, however, were almoſt come up with them, when they reached the mouth of a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, into which ſhe ran for concealment. Hippolitus drew his ſword; and awaiting his enemies, ſtood to defend the entrance.</p>
               <p>In a few moments Julia heard the claſhing of ſwords. Her heart trembled for Hippolitus; and ſhe was upon the point of returning to reſign herſelf at once to the power of her enemies, and thus avert the danger that threatened him, when ſhe diſtinguiſhed the loud voice of the duke.</p>
               <p>She ſhrunk involuntarily at the found, and purſuing the windings of the cavern, fled into its inmoſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes. Here ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he cave, and drew near. It was
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:029381_0199_0FE0D64C7B7413D8"/>
now evident that Hippolitus was conquered, and that her enemies were in ſearch of her. She threw round a look of unutterable anguiſh, and perceived very near, by a ſudden gleam of torch-light, a low and deep receſs in the rock. The light, which belonged to her purſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ers, grew ſtronger; and ſhe entered the rock on her knees, for the overhanging crags would not ſuffer her to paſs otherwiſe; and having gone a few yards, perceived that it was terminated by a door. The door yielded to her touch, and ſhe ſuddenly found herſelf in a highly vaulted cavern, which received a feeble light from the moon-beams that ſtreamed through an open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the rock above.</p>
               <p>She cloſed the door, and pauſed to liſten. The voices grew louder, and more diſtinct, and at laſt approached ſo near that ſhe diſtinguiſhed what was ſaid. Above the reſt ſhe heard the voice of the duke. "It is impoſſible ſhe can have quitted the cavern," ſaid he, "and I will not leave it till I have found her. Seek to the left of that rock, while I examine beyond this point."</p>
               <p>Theſe words were ſufficient for Julia; ſhe fled from the door acroſs the cavern before her, and having ran a conſiderable way without coming to a termination, ſtopped to breathe. All was now ſtill; and as ſhe looked around, the gloomy obſcurity of the place ſtruck upon her fancy all its horrors. She imperfectly ſurveyed the vaſtneſs of the cavern in wild amazement, and feared that ſhe had precipitated herſelf again into the power of banditti, for whom alone this place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>it receptacle. Having liſtened a long time without hearing a return of voices, ſhe ſought to find the door by which ſhe had entered, but the gloom, and vaſt extent of the cavern, made the endeavour hopeleſs, and the attempt unſucceſsful. Having wandered a conſiderable time through the v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>id,
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:029381_0200_0FE0D5B30DC65248"/>
ſhe gave up the effort, endeavoured to reſign herſelf to her fate, and to compoſe her diſtracted thoughts. The remembrance of her former wonderful eſcape inſpired her with confidence in the mercy of God. But Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politus and Ferdinand were now both loſt to her— loſt perhaps for ever—and the uncertainty of their fate gave force to fancy, and poignancy to ſorrow.</p>
               <p>Towards morning, grief yielded to nature, and Julia ſunk to repoſe. She was awakened by the ſun, whoſe rays darting obliquely through the opening in the rock, threw a partial light acroſs the cavern. Her ſenſes were yet bewildered by ſleep, and ſhe ſtarted in affright on beholding her ſituation; as recollection gradually ſtole upon her mind, her ſorrows returned, and ſhe ſickened at the fatal retroſpect.</p>
               <p>She aroſe, and renewed her ſearch for an outlet. The light, imperfect as it was, now aſſiſted her, and ſhe found a door, which ſhe perceived was not the one by which ſhe had entered. It was firmly faſtened; ſhe diſcovered, however, the bolts and the lock that held it, and at length uncloſed the door. It opened upon a dark paſſage, which ſhe entered.</p>
               <p>She groped along the winding walls for ſome time, when ſhe perceived the way was obſtructed. She now diſcovered that a door interrupted her progreſs, and ſought for the bolts which might faſten it. Theſe ſhe found<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and ſtrengthened by deſperation forced them back The door opened, and ſhe beheld in a ſmall room, which received its feeble light from a window above, the pale and emaciated figure of a woman, ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with half cloſed eyes, in a kind of elbow chair. On perceiving Julia, ſhe ſtarted from her ſeat, and her countenance expreſſed a wild ſurpriſe. Her features, which were worn by ſorrow, ſtill retained the traces of
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:029381_0201_0FE0D5BA68A672C8"/>
beauty, and in her air was a mild dignity that excited in Julia an involuntary veneration.</p>
               <p>She ſeemed as if about to ſpeak, when fixing her eyes earneſtly and ſteadily upon Julia, ſhe ſtood for a moment in eager gaze, and ſuddenly exclaiming, "My daughter!" fainted away.</p>
               <p>The aſtoniſhment of Julia would ſcarcely ſuffer her to aſſiſt the lady, who lay ſenſeleſs on the floor. A mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of ſtrange imperfect ideas ruſhed upon her mind, and ſhe was loſt in confuſion and perplexity; but as ſhe examined the features of the ſtranger, which were now re-kindling into life, ſhe thought ſhe diſcovered the reſemblance of Emilia!</p>
               <p>The lady breathing a deep ſigh, uncloſed her eyes; ſhe raiſed them to Julia, who hung over her in ſpeechleſs aſtoniſhment, and fixing them upon her with a tender earneſt expreſſion—they filled with tears. She preſſed Julia to her heart, and a few moments of exquiſite, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable emotion followed. When the lady grew more compoſed, "Thank heaven!" ſaid ſhe, "my prayer is granted. I am permitted to embrace one of my children before I die. Tell me what brought you hither. Has the marquis at laſt relented, and allowed me once more to behold you, or has his death diſſolved my wretched bondage?"</p>
               <p>Truth now glimmered upon the mind of Julia, but ſo faintly, that inſtead of enlightening, it ſerved only to encreaſe her perplexity.</p>
               <p>"Is the marquis Mazzini living?" continued the lady. Theſe words were not to be doubted; Julia threw herſelf at the feet of her mother, and embracing her knees in an energy of joy, anſwered only in ſobs.</p>
               <p>The marchioneſs eagerly inquired after her children. "Emilia is living," anſwered Julia, "but my dear brother—" "Tell me," cried the marchioneſs with
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:029381_0202_0FE0D5BF0054EE30"/>
quickneſs. An explanation enſued. When ſhe was informed concerning Ferdinand, ſhe ſighed deeply, and raiſing her eyes to heaven, endeavoured to aſſume a look of pious reſignation; but the ſtruggle of mater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal feeling was viſible in her countenance, and almoſt overcame her powers of reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>Julia gave a ſhort account of the preceding adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and of her entrance into the cavern; and found to her inexpreſſible ſurpriſe, that ſhe was now in a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubterranean abode belonging to the ſouthern build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the caſtle of Mazzini! The marchioneſs was beginning her narrative, when a door was heard to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock above, and the ſound of a footſtep followed.</p>
               <p>"Fly!" cried the marchioneſs, "ſecrete yourſelf if poſſible, for the marquis is coming." Julia's heart ſunk at theſe words; ſhe pauſed not a moment, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired through the door by which ſhe had entered. This ſhe had ſcarcely done, when another door of the cell was unlocked, and ſhe heard the voice of her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Its ſounds thrilled her with univerſal tremor; the dread of diſcovery ſo ſtrongly operated upon her mind, that ſhe ſtood in momentary expectation of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the door of the paſſage uncloſed by the marquis; and ſhe was deprived of all power of ſeeking refuge in the cavern.</p>
               <p>At length the marquis, who came with food, quitted the cell, and re-locked the door, when Julia ſtole forth from her hiding place. The marchioneſs again em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, and wept over her daughter. The narrative of her ſufferings upon which ſhe now entered, entirely diſſipated the myſtery which had ſo long enveloped the ſouthern buildings of the caſtle.</p>
               <p>"Oh! why," ſaid the marchioneſs, "is it my taſk to diſcover to my daughter the vices of her father? In relating my ſufferings, I reveal his crime<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="204" facs="unknown:029381_0203_0FE0D5C339AC4840"/>
It is now about fifteen years, as near as I can gueſs from the ſmall means I have of judging, ſince I entered this horrible abode. My ſorrows, alas! be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan not here; they commenced at an earlier period. But it is ſufficient to obſerve, that the paſſion whence originated all my misfortunes, was diſcovered by me long before I experienced the more baleful effect of its influence.</p>
               <p>"Seven years had elapſed ſince my marriage, when the charms of Maria de Vellorno, a young lady ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly beautiful, inſpired the marquis with a paſſion as violent as it was irregular. I obſerved with a deep and ſilent anguiſh, the cruel indifference of my lord towards me, and the rapid progreſs of his paſſion for another. I ſeverely examined my paſt conduct, which I am thankful to ſay preſented a retroſpect of only blameleſs actions; and I endeavoured by meek ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and tender aſſiduities, to recall that affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which was, alas! gone for ever. My meek ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion was conſidered as marks of a ſervile and inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible mind; and my tender aſſiduities, to which his heart no longer reſponded, created only diſguſt, and exalted the proud ſpirit it was meant to conciliate.</p>
               <p>"The ſecret grief which this change occaſioned, conſumed my ſpirits, and preyed upon my conſtitution, till at length a ſevere illneſs threatened my life. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the approach of death with a ſteady eye, and even welcomed it as the paſs-port to tranquillity; but it was deſtined that I ſhould linger through new ſcenes of miſery.</p>
               <p>"One day, which it appears was the paroxyſm of my diſorder, I ſunk into a ſtate of total torpidity, in which I lay for ſeveral hours. It is impoſſible to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe my feelings, when, on recovering, I found my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in this hideous abode. For ſome time I doubted
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:029381_0204_0FE0D5C9BA0B5830"/>
my ſenſes, and afterwards believed that I had quitted this world for another; but I was not ſuffered to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in my error, the appearance of the marquis bringing me to a perfect ſenſe of my ſituation.</p>
               <p>"I now underſtood that I had been conveyed by his direction to this receſs of horror, where it was his will I ſhould remain. My prayers, my ſupplications were ineffectual; the hardneſs of his heart repelled my ſorrows back upon myſelf; and as no entreaties could prevail upon him to inform me where I was, or of his reaſon for placing me here, I remained for many years ignorant of my vicinity to the caſtle, and of the motive for my confinement.</p>
               <p>"From that fatal day, until very lately, I ſaw the marquis no more—but was attended by a perſon who had been for ſome years dependant upon his bounty, and whom neceſſity, united to an inſenſible heart, had doubtleſs induced to accept this office. He generally brought me a week's proviſions, at ſtated intervals, and I remarked that his viſits were always in the night.</p>
               <p>"Contrary to my expectation, or my wiſh, nature did that for me which medicine had refuſed, and I recovered as if to puniſh with diſappointment and anxiety my cruel tyrant. I afterwards learned, that in obedience to the marquis's order, I had been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to this ſpot by Vincent during the night, and that I had been buried in effigy at a neighbouring church, with all the pomp of funeral honour due to my rank."</p>
               <p>At the name of Vincent, Julia ſtarted; the doubtful words he had uttered on his death-bed were now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained—the cloud of myſtery which had ſo long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved the ſouthern buildings broke at once away; and each particular circumſtance that had excited her former terror, aroſe to her view entirely unveiled by the words of the marchioneſs—The long and total
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:029381_0205_0FE0D5CF446D1650"/>
deſertion of this part of the fabric—the light that had appeared through the caſement—the figure ſhe had ſeen iſſue from the tower—the midnight noiſes ſhe had heard—were circumſtances evidently dependant on the impriſonment of the marchioneſs; the latter of which incidents were produced either by Vincent, or the marquis, in their attendance upon her.</p>
               <p>When ſhe conſidered the long and dreadful ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of her mother, and that ſhe had for many years lived ſo near her ignorant of her miſery, and even her exiſtence—ſhe was loſt in aſtoniſhment and pity.</p>
               <p>"My days," continued the marchioneſs, "paſſed in a dead uniformity, more dreadful than the moſt acute viciſſitudes of misfortune, and which would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have ſubdued my reaſon, had not thoſe firm principles of religious faith, which I imbibed in early youth, enabled me to withſtand the ſtill, but forceful, preſſure of my calamity.</p>
               <p>"The inſenſible heart of Vincent at length began to ſoften by my misfortunes. He brought me ſeveral articles of comfort, of which I had hitherto been deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, and anſwered ſome queſtions I put to him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning my family. To releaſe me from my preſent ſituation, however his inclination might befriend me, was not to be expected, ſince his life would have paid the forfeiture of what would be termed his duty.</p>
               <p>"I now firſt diſcovered my vicinity to the caſtle. I learned alſo, that the marquis had married Maria de Vellorno, with whom he reſided at Naples, but that my daughters were left at Mazzini. This laſt intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence awakened in my heart the throbs of warm ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal tenderneſs, and on my knees I ſupplicated to ſee them. So earneſtly I entreated, and ſo ſolemnly I promiſed to return quietly to my priſon, that at length,

prudence yielded to pity, and Vincent conſented to my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>"On the ſucceeding day he came to the cell, and informed me my children were going into the woods, and that I might ſee them f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>m a window near which they would paſs. My nerves thrilled at theſe words, and I could ſcarcely ſupport myſelf to the ſpot I ſo eagerly ſought. He led me through long and intricate paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, as I gueſſed by the frequent turnings, for my eyes were bound, till I reached a hall of the ſouth buildings. I followed to a room above, where the full light of day once more burſt upon my ſight, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt overpowered me. Vincent placed me by a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, which looked towards the woods. Oh! what moments of painful impatience were thoſe in which I awaited your arrival!"</p>
               <p>"At length you appeared. I ſaw you—I ſaw my children—and was neither permitted to claſp them to my heart, or to ſpeak to them! You was leaning on the arm of your ſiſter, and your countenances ſpoke the ſprightly happy innocence of youth.—Alas! you knew not the wretched fate of your mother, who then gazed upon you! Although you were at too great a diſtance for my weak voice to reach you, with the utmoſt difficulty, I avoided throwing open the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and endeavouring to diſcover myſelf. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of my ſolemn premiſe, and that the life of Vincent would be ſacrificed by the act, alone reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me. I ſtruggled for ſome time with emotions too powerful for my nature, and fainted away.</p>
               <p>"On recovering I called wildly for my children, and went to the window—but you were gone! Not all the entreaties of Vincent could for ſome time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move me from this ſtation, where I waited in the fond expectation of ſeeing you again—but you appeared no
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:029381_0207_0FE0D5DB668413B0"/>
more! At laſt I returned to my cell in an extaſy of grief which I tremble even to remember.</p>
               <p>"This interview, ſo eagerly ſought, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctantly granted, proved a ſource of new miſery— inſtead of calming, it agitated my mind with a reſtleſs wild deſpair, which bore away my ſtrongeſt powers of reſiſtance. I raved inceſſantly of my children, and inceſſantly ſolicited to ſee them again—Vincent, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, had found but too much cauſe to repent of his firſt indulgence, to grant me a ſecond.</p>
               <p>"About this time a circumſtance occurred which promiſed me a ſpeedy releaſe from calamity. Above a week elapſed, and Vincent did not appear. My little ſtock of proviſion was exhauſted, and I had been two days without food, when I again heard the doors that led to my priſon creek on their hinges. An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known ſtep approached, and in a few minutes the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis entered my cell! My blood was chilled at the ſight, and I cloſed my eyes as I hoped for the laſt time. The ſound of his voice recalled me. His countenance was dark and ſullen, and I perceived that he trembled. He informed me that Vincent was no more, and that henceforward, his office, he ſhould take upon himſelf. I forbore to reproach—where reproach would only have produced new ſufferings, and withheld ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion where it would have exaſperated conſcience and inflamed revenge. My knowledge of the marquis's ſecond marriage I concealed.</p>
               <p>"He uſually attended me when night might beſt conceal his viſits; though theſe were irregular in their return. Lately, from what motive I cannot gueſs, he has ceaſed his nocturnal viſits, and comes only in the day.</p>
               <p>"Once when midnight encreaſed the darkneſs of my priſon, and ſeemed to render ſilence even more
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:029381_0208_0FE0D5E0007B1F88"/>
awful, touched by the ſacred horrors of the hour, I poured forth my diſtreſs in loud lamentation. Oh! never can I forget what I felt, when I heard a diſtant voice anſwer to my moan! A wild ſurpriſe, which was ſtrangely mingled with hope, ſeized me, and in my firſt emotion I ſhould have anſwered the call, had not a recollection croſſed me, which blaſted at once every half-raiſed ſenſation of joy. I remembered the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful vengeance which the marquis had ſworn to execute upon me if I ever, by any means, endeavoured to make known the place of my concealment; and though life had long been a burden to me, I dared not to incur the certainty of being murdered. I alſo well knew that no perſon who might diſcover my ſituation could effect my enlargement; for I had no relations to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver me by force, and the marquis, you know, has not only power to impriſon, but alſo the right of life and death in his own domains. I, therefore, forbore to anſwer the call, though I could not entirely repreſs my lamentation. I long perplexed myſelf with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to account for this ſtrange circumſtance, and am to this moment ignorant of its cauſe."</p>
               <p>Julia remembering that Ferdinand had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſined in a dungeon of the caſtle, it inſtantly occurred to her that his priſon, and that of the marchioneſs, were not far diſtant; and ſhe ſcrupled not to believe that it was his voice which her mother had heard. She was right in this belief, and it was indeed the marchioneſs whoſe groans had formerly cauſed Ferdinand ſo much alarm, both in the marble hall of the ſouth buildings, and in his dungeon.</p>
               <p>When Julia co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>municated her opinion, and the marchioneſs believed that ſhe had heard the voice of her ſon—her emotion was extreme, and it was ſome time before ſhe could reſume her narration.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="210" facs="unknown:029381_0209_0FE0D5E6F08280B8"/>"A ſhort time ſince," continued the marchioneſs, "the marquis brought me a fortnight's proviſion, and told me that I ſhould probably ſee him no more till the expiration of that term. His abſence at this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod you have explained in your account of the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions at the abbey of St. Auguſtin. How can I ever ſufficiently acknowledge the obligations I owe to my dear and invaluable friend Madame de Menon! Oh! that it might be permitted me to teſtify my gratitude."</p>
               <p>Julia attended to the narrative of her mother in ſilent aſtoniſhment, and gave all the ſympathy which ſorrow could demand. "Surely" cried ſhe, "the providence on whom you have ſo firmly relied, and whoſe inflictions you have ſupported with a fortitude ſo noble, has conducted me through a labyrinth of misfortunes to this ſpot, for the purpoſe of delivering you! Oh! let us haſten to fly this horrid abode—let us ſeek to eſcape through <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he cavern by which I entered."</p>
               <p>She pauſed, in earneſt expectation awaiting a reply. "Whither can I fly?" ſaid the marchioneſs, deeply ſighing. This queſtion ſpoken with the emphaſis of deſpair, affected Julia to tears, and ſhe was for a while ſilent.</p>
               <p>"The marquis," reſumed Julia, "would know not where to ſeek you, or if he found you beyond his own domains, would fear to claim you. A convent may afford for the preſent a ſafe aſylum; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall happen, ſurely no fate you may hereafter encounter can be more dreadful than the one you now experience."</p>
               <p>The marchioneſs aſſented to the truth of this, yet her broken ſpirits, the effect of long ſorrow and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, made her heſitate how to act; and there was a kind of placid deſpair in her look, which too faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:029381_0210_0FE0D5EBD0206B00"/>
depictured her feelings. It was obvious to Julia that the cavern ſhe had paſſed wound beneath the range of mountains on whoſe oppoſite ſide ſtood the caſtle of Mazzini. The hills thus riſing, formed a ſcreen which muſt entirely conceal their emergence from the mouth of the cave, and their flight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from thoſe in the caſtle. She repreſented theſe circumſtances to her mother, and urged them ſo forcibly, that the lethargy of deſpair yielded to hope, and the marchioneſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted herſelf to the conduct of her daughter.</p>
               <p>"Oh! let me lead you to light and life!" cried Julia with warm enthuſiaſm. "Surely heaven can bleſs me with no greater good than by making me the deliverer of my mother!" They both knelt down; and the marchioneſs with that affecting eloquence which true piety inſpires, and with that confidence which had ſupported her through ſo many miſeries, committed herſelf to the protection of God, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored his favour on their attempt.</p>
               <p>They aroſe, but as they converſed farther on their plan, Julia recollected that ſhe was deſtitute of money —the banditti having robbed her of all! The ſudden ſhock produced by this remembrance almoſt ſubdued her ſpirits; never till this moment had ſhe underſtood the value of money. But ſhe commanded her feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and reſolved to conceal this circumſtance from the marchioneſs, preferring the chance of any evil they might encounter from without, to the certain miſery of this terrible impriſonment.</p>
               <p>Having taken what proviſion the marquis had brought, they quitted the cell, and entered upon the dark paſſage, along which they paſſed with cautious ſteps. Julia came firſt to the door of the cavern, but who can paint her diſtreſs when ſhe found it was faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened! All her efforts to open it were ineffectual.—
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:029381_0211_0FE0D5F4EACFF600"/>
The door which had cloſed after her, was held by a ſpring lock, and could be opened on this ſide only with a key. When ſhe underſtood this circumſtance, the marchioneſs, with a placid reſignation which ſeemed to exalt her above humanity, addreſſed herſelf again to heaven, and turned back to her cell. Here Julia indulged without reſerve, and without ſcruple, the exceſs of her grief. The marchioneſs wept over her. "Not for myſelf," ſaid ſhe, "do I grieve,— I have too long been inured to misfortune to ſink under its preſſure. This diſappointment is intrinſically, perhaps, little—for I had no certain refuge from cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity —and had it even been otherwiſe, a few years only of ſuffering would have been ſpared me. It is for you, Julia, who ſo much lament my fate; and who in being thus delivered to the power of your father, are ſacrificed to the duke de Luovo—that my heart ſwells."</p>
               <p>Julia could make no reply, but by preſſing to her lips the hand which was held forth to her. She ſaw all the wretchedneſs of her ſituation; and her fearful uncertainty concerning Hippolitus and Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand, formed no inferior part of her affliction.</p>
               <p>"If," reſumed the marchioneſs, you prefer impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment with your mother, to a marriage with the the duke, you may ſtill ſecrete yourſelf in the paſſage we have juſt quitted, and ſhare the proviſion which is brought me."</p>
               <p>"O! talk not, madame, of a marriage with the duke," ſaid Julia; "ſurely any fate is preferable to that. But when I conſider that in remaining here, I am condemned only to the ſufferings which my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther has ſo long endured, and that this confinement will enable me to ſoften, by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

preſent ſituation with complacency, even did a marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age with the duke appear leſs hateful to me."</p>
               <p>"Excellent girl!" exclaimed the marchioneſs, claſping Julia to her boſom; "the ſufferings you la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are almoſt repaid by this proof of your goodneſs and affection! Alas! that I ſhould have been ſo long deprived of ſuch a daughter!"</p>
               <p>Julia now endeavoured to imitate the fortitude of her mother, and tenderly concealed her anxiety for Ferdinand and Hippolitus, the idea of whom inceſſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haunted her imagination. When the marquis brought food to the cell, ſhe retired to the avenue leading to the cavern, and eſcaped diſcovery.</p>

               <p>THE marquis, meanwhile, whoſe indefatigable ſearch after Julia failed of ſucceſs, was ſucceſſively the ſlave of alternate paſſions, and he poured forth the ſpleen of diſappointment on his unhappy domeſtics.</p>
               <p>The marchioneſs, who may now more properly be called Maria de Vellorno, inflamed, by artful inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the paſſions already irritated, and heightened with cruel triumph his reſentment towards Julia and Madame de Menon. She repreſented, what his feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings too acutely acknowledged,—that by the obſtinate diſobedience of the firſt, and the machinations of the laſt, a prieſt had been enabled to arreſt his authority as a father—to inſult the ſacred honour of his nobility— and to overturn at once his proudeſt ſchemes of power and ambition. She declared it her opinion, that the <hi>Abate</hi> was acquainted with the place of Julia's preſent retreat, and upbraided the marquis with want of ſpirit in thus ſubmitting to be outwitted by a prieſt, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing

                  </gap>l the <hi>Abate</hi> to reſtore Julia.</p>
               <p>This reproach ſtung to the very ſoul of the marquis; he felt all its force, and was at the ſame time conſcious of his inability to obviate it. The effect of his crimes now fell in ſevere puniſhment upon his own head. The threatened ſecret, which was no other than the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment of the marchioneſs, arreſted his arm of vengeance, and compelled him to ſubmit to inſult and diſappointment. But the reproach of Maria ſunk deep in his mind; it fomented his pride into redoubled fury, and he now repelled with diſdain the idea of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
               <p>He revolved the means which might effect his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe —he ſaw but one—this was the death of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs.</p>
               <p>The commiſſion of one crime often requires the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petration of another. When once we enter on the labyrinth of vice, we can ſeldom return, but are led on through correſpondent mazes to deſtruction. To ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate the effect of his firſt crime, it was now neceſſary the marquis ſhould commit a ſecond, and conceal the <hi>impriſonment</hi> of the marchioneſs by her <hi>murder.</hi> Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the only living witneſs of her exiſtence, when ſhe was removed, the allegations of the <hi>Padre Abate</hi> would by this means be unſupported by any proof, and he might then boldly appeal to the pope for the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his child.</p>
               <p>He muſed upon his ſcheme, and the more he accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed his mind to contemplate it, the leſs ſcrupulous he became. The crime from which he would former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have ſhrunk, he now ſurveyed with a ſteady eye. The fury of his paſſions, unaccuſtomed to reſiſtance, uniting with the force of what ambition termed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity —urged him to the deed, and he determined up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:029381_0214_0FE0D6070BA82180"/>
the murder of his wife. The means of effecting his purpoſe were eaſy and various; but as he was not yet ſo entirely hardened as to be able to view her dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pangs, and embrue his own hands in her blood, he choſe to diſpatch her by means of poiſon, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to mingle in her food.</p>
               <p>But a new affliction was preparing for the marquis, which attacked him where he was moſt vulnerable; and the veil which had ſo long overſhadowed his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was now to be removed. He was informed by Baptiſta of the infidelity of Maria de Vellorno. In the firſt emotion of paſſion, he ſpurned the informer from his preſence, and diſdained to believe the circumſtance. A little reflexion changed the object of his reſentment; he recalled the ſervant, whoſe faithfulneſs he had no reaſon to diſtruſt, and condeſcended to interrogate him on the ſubject of his misfortune.</p>
               <p>He learned that an intimacy had for ſome time ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted between Maria and the cavalier de Vincini; and that the aſſignation was uſually held at the pavillion on the ſea ſhore, in an evening. Baptiſta farther declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that if the marquis deſired a confirmation of his words, he might obtain it by viſiting this ſpot at the hour mentioned.</p>
               <p>This information lighted up the wildeſt paſſions of his nature; his former ſufferings faded away before the ſtronger influence of the preſent misfortune, and it ſeemed as if he had never taſted miſery till now. To ſuſpect the wife upon whom he doated with romantic fondneſs, on whom he had centered all his firmeſt hopes of happineſs, and for whoſe ſake he had committed the crime which embittered even his preſent moments, and which would involve him in ſtill deeper guilt—to find <hi>her</hi> ungrateful to his love, and a traitoreſs to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour—produced a miſery more poignant than any his
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:029381_0215_0FE0D60DF9490DE8"/>
imagination had conceived. He was torn by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending paſſions, and oppoſite reſolutions:—now he reſolved to expiate her guilt with her blood—and now he melted in all the ſoftneſs of love. Vengeance and honour bade him ſtrike to the heart which had betrayed him, and urged him inſtantly to the deed—when the idea of her beauty—her winning ſmiles—her fond en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearments ſtole upon his fancy, and ſubdued his heart; he almoſt wept to the idea of injuring her, and in ſpite of appearances, pronounced her faithful. The ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding moments plunged him again in uncertainty; his tortures acquired new vigour from ceſſation, and again he experienced all the phrenzy of deſpair. He was now reſolved to end his doubts by repairing to the pavillion; but again his heart wavered in irreſolution how to proceed ſhould his fears be confirmed. In the mean time he determined to watch the behaviour of Maria with ſevere vigilance.</p>
               <p>They met at dinner, and he obſerved her cloſely, but diſcovered <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>t the ſmalleſt impropriety in her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. Her ſmiles and her beauty again wound their faſcinations round his heart, and in the exceſs of their influence he was almoſt tempted to repair the injury which his late ſuſpicions had done her, by confeſſing them at her feet. The appearance of the cavalier de Vincini, however, renewed his ſuſpicions; his heart throbbed wildly, and with reſtleſs impatience he watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the return of evening, which would remove his ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.</p>
               <p>Night at length came. He repaired to the pavillion, and ſecreted himſelf among the trees that embowered it. Many minutes had not paſſed, when he heard a ſound of low whiſpering voices ſteal from among the trees, and foot-ſteps approaching down the alley. He
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:029381_0216_0FE0D612C60FD1A0"/>
ſtood almoſt petrified with terrible ſenſations, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently heard ſome perſons enter the pavillion. The marquis now emerged from his hiding place; a faint light iſſued from the building. He ſtole to the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and beheld within, Maria and the cavalier de Vincini. Fired at the ſight, he drew his ſword, and ſprang forward. The ſound of his ſtep alarmed the cavalier, who, on perceiving the marquis, ruſhed by him from the pavillion, and diſappeared among the woods. The marquis purſued, but could not overtake him; and he returned to the pavillion with an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of plunging his ſword in the heart of Maria, when he diſcovered her ſenſeleſs on the ground. Pity now ſuſpended his vengeance; he pauſed in agonizing gaze upon her, and returned his ſword into the ſcabbard.</p>
               <p>She revived, but on obſerving the marquis, ſcream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and relapſed. He haſtened to the caſtle for aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; inventing, to conceal his diſgrace, ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for her ſudden illneſs, and ſhe was conveyed to her chamber.</p>
               <p>The marquis was now not ſuffered to doubt her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity, but the paſſion which her conduct abuſed, her faithleſsneſs could not ſubdue; he ſtill doated, with abſurd fondneſs, and even regretted that uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty could no longer flatter him with hope. It ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as if his deſire of her affection encreaſed with his knowledge of the loſs of it; and the very circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which ſhould have rouſed his averſion, by a ſtrange perverſity of diſpoſition, appeared to heighten his paſſion, and to make him think it impoſſible he could exiſt without her.</p>
               <p>When the firſt energy of his indignation was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided, he determined, therefore, to reprove and to pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, but hereafter to reſtore her to favour.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="218" facs="unknown:029381_0217_0FE0D61751FAB8E0"/>In this reſolution he went to her apartment, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended her falſehood in terms of juſt indignation.</p>
               <p>Maria de Vellorno, in whom the late diſcovery had rouſed reſentment, inſtead of awakening penitence, had exaſperated pride without exciting ſhame, heard the upbraidings of the marquis with impatience, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to them with acrimonious violence.</p>
               <p>She boldly aſſerted her innocence, and inſtantly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented a ſtory, the plauſibility of which might have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a man who had evidence leſs certain than his ſenſes to contradict it. She behaved with a haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the moſt inſolent; and when ſhe perceived that the marquis was no longer to be miſled, and that her violence failed to accompliſh its purpoſe, ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to tears and ſupplications. But the artifice was too glaring to ſucceed; and the marquis quitted her apartment in an agony of reſentment.</p>
               <p>His former faſcinations, however, quickly returned, and again held him in ſuſpenſion between love and vengeance. That the vehemence of his paſſion how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, might not want an object, he ordered Baptiſta to diſcover the retreat of the cavalier de Vincini, on whom he meant to revenge his loſt honour. Shame forbade him to employ others in the ſearch.</p>
               <p>This diſcovery ſuſpended for a while the operations of that fatal ſcheme, which had before employed the thoughts of the marquis; but it had only ſuſpended— not deſtroyed them. The late occurrence had anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated his domeſtic happineſs; but his pride now roſe to reſcue him from deſpair, and he centered all his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hopes upon ambition. In a moment of cool re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion, he conſidered that he had derived neither hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs nor content from the purſuit of diſſipated plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, to which he had hitherto ſacrificed every op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing conſideration. He reſolved, therefore, to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:029381_0218_0FE0D61DADD93A78"/>
the gay ſchemes of diſſipation which had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allured him, and dedicate himſelf entirely to ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the purſuits and delights of which he hoped to bury all his cares. He therefore became more earneſt than ever for the marriage of Julia with the duke de Luovo, through whoſe means he deſigned to involve himſelf in the intereſts of the ſtate, and determined to recover her at whatever conſequence. He reſolved without further delay to appeal to the pope; but to do this with ſafety, it was neceſſary that the marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhould die; and he returned therefore to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration and execution of his diabolical purpoſe.</p>
               <p>He mingled a poiſonous drug with the food he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for her; and when night arrived, carried it to the cell. As he unlocked the door, his hand trembled; and when he preſented the food, and looked conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the laſt time upon the marchioneſs, who receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it with humble thankfulneſs, his heart almoſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lented. His countenance, over which was diffuſed the paleneſs of death, expreſſed the ſecret movements of his ſoul, and he gazed upon her with eyes of ſtiffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed horror. Alarmed by his looks, ſhe fell upon her knees to ſupplicate his pity.</p>
               <p>Her attitude recalled his bewildered ſenſes; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to aſſume a tranquil aſpect, he bade her riſe, and inſtantly quitted the cell, fearful of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtability of his purpoſe. His mind was not yet ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently hardened by guilt to repel the arrows of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and his imagination reſponded to her power. As he paſſed through the long dreary paſſages from the priſon, ſolemn and myſterious ſounds ſeemed to ſpeak in every murmur of the blaſt which crept along their windings, and he often ſtarted and looked back.</p>
               <p>He reached his chamber, and having ſhut the door, ſurveyed the room in fearful examination. Ideal

The gloom of the hour, and the death-like ſilence that prevailed, aſſiſted the horrors of his imagination. He half repented of the deed, yet deemed it now too late to obviate it; and he threw himſelf on his bed in terrible emotion. His head grew dizzy, and a ſudden faintneſs overcame him; he heſitated, and a length aroſe to ring for aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but found himſelf unable to ſtand.</p>
               <p>In a few moments he was ſomewhat revived, and rang his bell; but before any perſon appeared, he was ſeized with terrible pains, and ſtaggering to his bed, ſunk ſenſeleſs upon it.

The mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis now beckoned his attendants to quit the room, and they were preparing to obey, when a violent noiſe was heard from without; almoſt in the ſame inſtant
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:029381_0220_0FE0D6281F89E9E0"/>
the door of the apartment was thrown open, and the ſervant who had been ſent for the marchioneſs, ruſhed in. His look alone declared the horror of his mind, for words he had none to utter. He ſtared wildly, and pointed to the gallery he had quitted. Ferdinand, ſeized with new terror, ruſhed the way he pointed to the apartment of the marchioneſs. A ſpectacle of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror preſented itſelf, Maria lay on a couch lifeleſs, and bathed in blood. A poignard, the inſtrument of her deſtruction, was on the floor; and it appeared from a letter which was found on the couch beſide her, that ſhe had died by her own hand. The paper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contained theſe words:
<floatingText type="letter">

               <p>It now appeared that the marquis was poiſoned by the vengeance of the woman for whom he had reſigned his conſcience. The conſternation and diſtreſs of Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand cannot eaſily be conceived: he haſtened back to his father's chamber, but determined to conceal the dreadful cataſtrophe of Maria de Vellorno. This pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution, however, was uſeleſs; for the ſervants, in the conſternation of terror, had revealed it, and the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis had fainted.</p>
               <p>Returning pains recalled his ſenſes, and the agonies he ſuffered were too ſhocking for the beholders. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical endeavours were applied, but the poiſon was too
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:029381_0221_0FE0D62CA72AEE88"/>
powerful for antidote. The marquis's pains at length ſubſided; the poiſon had exhauſted moſt of its rage, and he became tolerably eaſy. He waved his hand for the attendants to leave the room; and beckoning to Ferdinand, whoſe ſenſes were almoſt ſtunned by this accumulation of horror, bade him ſit down beſide him. "The hand of death is now upon me," ſaid he; "I would employ theſe laſt moments in revealing a deed, which is more dreadful to me than all the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily agonies I ſuffer. It will be ſome relief to me to diſcover it." Ferdinand graſped the hand of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis in ſpeechleſs terror. "The retribution of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is upon me," reſumed the marquis. "My puniſhment is the immediate conſequence of my guilt. Heaven has made that woman the inſtrument of its juſtice, whom I made the inſtrument of my crimes;— that woman for whoſe ſake I forgot conſcience, and braved vice—for whom I impriſoned an innocent wife, and afterwards murdered her."</p>
               <p>At theſe words every nerve of Ferdinand thrilled; he let go the marquis's hand, and ſtarted back. "Look not ſo fiercely on me," ſaid the marquis, in a hallow voice; "your eyes ſtrike death to my ſoul; my conſcience needs not this additional pang." "My mother!" exclaimed Ferdinand—"my mother! Speak, tell me"—"I have no breath," ſaid the marquis. "Oh! —Take theſe keys—the ſouth tower—the trap-door.—"Tis poſſible—Oh—"</p>
               <p>The marquis made a ſudden ſpring upwards, and fell lifeleſs on the bed. The attendants were called in, but he was gone for ever. His laſt words ſtruck with the force of lightning upon the mind of Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand; they ſeemed to ſay that his mother might yet exiſt. He took the keys; and ordering ſome of the ſervants to follow, haſtened to the ſouthern building;
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:029381_0222_0FE0D6320FFA5CD0"/>
he proceeded to the tower, and the trap-door beneath the ſtair-caſe was lifted. They all deſcended into a dark paſſage, which conducted them through ſeveral intricacies to the door of the cell. Ferdinand in trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling horrible expectation, applied the key; the door opened, and he entered—but what was his ſurpriſe when he found no perſon in the cell! He concluded that he had miſtaken the place, and quitted it for farther ſearch; but having followed the windings of the paſſage, by which he entered, without diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any other door, he returned to a more exact ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of the cell.

               <p>When the firſt violence of the emotions excited by the late ſcenes was ſubſided, he inquired concerning Maria de Vellorno.</p>
               <p>It appeared that on the day preceding this horrid tranſaction, the marquis had paſſed ſome hours in her apartment; that they were heard in loud diſpute;— that the paſſion of the Marquis grew high;—that he upbraided her with her paſt conduct, and threate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed her with a formal ſeparation. When the marquis quitted her ſhe was heard walking quick through the room, in a paſſion of tears, ſhe often ſuddenly ſtopped in vehement but incoherent exclamation; and at laſt
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:029381_0223_0FE0D638217C8668"/>
threw herſelf on the floor, and was for ſome time en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely ſtill. Here her woman found her, upon whoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance ſhe aroſe haſtily, and reproved her for appearing uncalled. After this ſhe remained ſilent and ſullen.</p>
               <p>She deſcended to ſupper, where the marquis met her alone at table. Little was ſaid during the repaſt, at the concluſion of which the ſervants were diſmiſſed; and it was believed that during the interval between ſupper, and the hour of repoſe, Maria de Vellorno contrived to mingle poiſon with the wine of the marquis. How ſhe had procured this poiſon was never diſcovered.</p>
               <p>She retired early to her chamber; and her woman obſerving that ſhe appeared much agitated, inquired if ſhe was ill. To this ſhe returned a ſhort anſwer in the negative, and her woman was ſoon afterwards diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed. But ſhe had hardly ſhut the door of the room, when ſhe heard her lady's voice recalling her. She returned, and received ſome trifling order, and obſerved that Maria looked uncommonly pale; there was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, a wildneſs in her eyes which frightened her, but ſhe did not dare to aſk any queſtions. She again quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the room, and had only reached the extremity of the gallery, when her miſtreſs's bell rang. She haſtened back. Maria inquired if the ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>quis was gone to bed, and if all was quiet. Being anſwered in the affirmative, ſhe replied, "This is a ſtill hour, and a dark one!—Good night!"</p>
               <p>Her woman having once more left the room, ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped at the door to liſten; but all within remaining ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, ſhe retired to reſt.</p>
               <p>It is probable that Maria perpetrated the fatal act ſoon after the diſmiſſion of her woman; for when ſhe was found two hours afterwards, ſhe appeared to have been dead ſome time. On examination, a wound was diſcovered on her left ſide, which had doubtleſs pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:029381_0224_0FE0D63D9453C7F8"/>
to the heart, from the ſuddenneſs of her death, and from the effuſion of blood which had followed.</p>
               <p>Theſe terrible events ſo deeply affected Emilia, that ſhe was confined to her bed by a dangerous illneſs. Ferdinand ſtruggled againſt the ſhock with manly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. But amid all the tumult of the preſent ſcenes, his uncertainty concerning Julia, whom he had left in the hands of banditti, and whom he had been with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held from ſeeking or reſcuing, formed perhaps the moſt affecting part of his diſtreſs.</p>
               <p>The late marquis de Mazzini, and Maria de Vellor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no, were interred with the honour due to their rank in the church of the convent of St. Nicolo. Their lives exhibited a boundleſs indulgence of violent and luxurious paſſions, and their deaths marked the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of ſuch indulgence, and held forth to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind a ſingular inſtance of divine vengeance.</p>

               <p>IN turning up the ground of the cell, it was diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered that it communicated with the dungeon in which Ferdinand had been confined, and where he had heard thoſe groans which occaſioned him ſo much terror.</p>
               <p>The ſtory which the marquis formerly related to his ſon concerning the ſouthern buildings, it was now evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent was fabricated for the purpoſe of concealing the impriſonment of the marchioneſs. In the choice of his ſubject, he certainly diſcovered ſome art; for the circumſtance related was calculated, by impreſſing terror, to prevent further inquiry into the receſſes of theſe buildings. It ſerved alſo to explain by ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural evidence the cauſe of thoſe ſounds, and of that appearance which had been there obſerved, but which were in reality occaſioned only by the marquis.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="226" facs="unknown:029381_0225_0FE0D641151D26C0"/>The event of the examination in the cell threw Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand into new perplexity. The marquis had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that he poiſoned his wife—yet her remains were not to be found; and the place which he ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to be that of her confinement, bore no veſtige of her having been there. There appeared no way by which ſhe could have eſcaped from her priſon; for both the door which opened upon the cell, and that which terminated the avenue beyond, were faſtened when tried by Ferdinand.</p>
               <p>But the young marquis had no time for uſeleſs ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation—ſerious duties called upon him. He believed that Julia was ſtill in the power of banditti; and on the concluſion of his father's funeral, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> the abode of the robbers, and to repair with the officers of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, accompanied by a part of his own people, to the reſcue of his ſiſter. On his arrival at Palermo he was informed that a banditti, whoſe retreat had been among the ruins of a monaſtery, ſituated in the foreſt of Marentino, was already diſcovered; that their abode had been ſearched; and themſelves ſecured for examples of public juſtice—but that no captive lady had been found amongſt them. This latter intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence excited in Ferdinand a very ſerious diſtreſs, and he was wholly unable to conjecture her fate. He ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained leave, however, to interrogate thoſe of the robbers, who were impriſoned at Palermo, but could draw from them no ſatisfactory or certain information.</p>
               <p>At length he quitted Palermo for the foreſt of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentino, thinking it poſſible that Julia might be heard of in its neighbourhood. He travelled on in melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly and dejection, and evening overtook him long before he reached the place of his deſtination. The night came on heavily in clouds, and a violent ſtorm of wind and rain aroſe. The road lay through a wild
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:029381_0226_0FE0D646DB16D080"/>
and rocky country, and Ferdinand could obtain no ſhelter. His attendants offered him their cloaks, but he refuſed to expoſe a ſervant to the hardſhip he would not himſelf endure. He travelled for ſome miles in a heavy rain; and the wind, which howled mournfully among the rocks, and whoſe ſolemn pauſes were fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the diſtant ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ings of the ſea, heightened the deſolation of the ſcene. At length he diſcerned amid the darkneſs from a far, a red light waving in the wind; it varied with the blaſt, but never totally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared. He puſhed his horſes into a gallop, and made towards it.</p>
               <p>The flame continued to direct his courſe; and on a nearer approach, he perceived by the red reflexion of its fires, ſtreaming a long radiance upon the waters beneath—a light-houſe ſituated upon a point of rock which over-hung the ſea. He knocked for admittance, and the door was opened by an old man, who bade him welcome.</p>
               <p>Within appeared a cheerful blazing fire, round which were ſeated ſeveral perſons, who ſeemed like himſelf to have ſought ſhelter from the tempeſt of the night. The ſight of the fire cheered him, and he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced towards it, when a ſudden ſcream ſeized his attention; the company roſe up in confuſion, and in the ſame inſtant he diſcovered Julia and Hippolitus. The joy of that moment is not to be deſcribed, but his attention was quickly called off from his own ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation to that of a lady, who during the general tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port had fainted. His ſenſat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ns on learning ſhe was his mother can only be conceived.</p>
               <p>She revived. "My ſon!" ſaid ſhe, in a languid voice, as ſhe preſſed him to her heart. "Great God, I am recompenſed! Surely this moment may repay a life of miſery!" He could only receive her careſſes in ſilence; but the ſudden tears which ſtarted in his
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:029381_0227_0FE0B73B07B03360"/>
eyes, ſpoke a language too expreſſive to be miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.</p>
               <p>When the firſt emotion of the ſcene was paſſed, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia inquired by what means Ferdinand had come to this ſpot. He anſwered her generally, and avoided for the preſent entering upon the affecting ſubject of the late events at the caſtle of Mazzini. Julia related the hiſtory of her adventures ſince ſhe parted with her brother. In her narration it appeared that Hippoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, who was taken by the duke de Luovo, at the mouth of the cave, had afterwards eſcaped, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the cavern in ſearch of Julia. The low re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in the rock, through which Julia had paſſed, he perceived by the light of his flambeau. He pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated to the cavern beyond, and from thence to the priſon of the marchioneſs. No colour of language can paint the ſcene which followed; it is ſufficient to ſay that the whole party agreed to quit the cell at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of night. But this being a night on which it was known the marquis would viſit the priſon, they agreed to defer their departure till after his appearance, and thus elude the danger to be expected from an early diſcovery of the eſcape of the marchioneſs.</p>
               <p>At the ſound of footſteps above, Hippolitus and Julia had ſecreted themſelves in the avenue; and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately on the marquis's departure they all repaired to the cavern, leaving in the hurry of their flight, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched, the poiſonous food he had brought. Having eſcaped from thence they proceeded to a neighbouring village, where horſes were procured to carry them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Palermo. Here after a tedious journey they arrived, in the deſign of embarking for Italy. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary winds had detained them till the day on which Ferdinand left that city, when apprehenſive and weary of delay, they hired a ſmall veſſel, and determined to
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:029381_0228_0FE0D65205F8DEA0"/>
brave the winds. They had ſoon reaſon to repent their temerity; for the veſſel had not been long at ſea when the ſtorm aroſe, which threw them back upon the ſhores of Sicily, and brought them to the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, where they were diſcovered by Ferdinand.</p>
               <p>On the following morning Ferdinand returned with his friends to Palermo, where he firſt diſcloſed the late fatal events of the Caſtle. They now ſettled their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture plans; and Ferdinand haſtened to the caſtle of Mazzini to fetch Emilia, and to give orders for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of his houſehold to his palace at Naples, where he deſigned to fix his future reſidence. The diſtreſs of Emilia, whom he found recovered from her indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yielded to joy and wonder, when ſhe heard of the exiſtence of her mother, and the ſafety of her ſiſter. She departed with Ferdinand for Palermo, where her friends awaited her, and where the joy of the meeting was conſiderably heightened by the appearance of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame de Menon, for whom the marchioneſs had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched a meſſenger to St. Auguſtin's. Madame had quitted the abbey for another convent, to which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the meſſenger was directed. This happy party now embarked for Naples.</p>
               <p>From this period the caſtle of Mazzini, which had been the theatre of a dreadful cataſtrophe, and whoſe ſcenes would have revived in the minds of the chief perſonages connected with it, painful and ſhocking re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collections—was abandoned.</p>
               <p>On their arrival at Naples, Ferdinand preſented to the king a clear and ſatisfactory account of the late events at the caſtle, in conſequence of which the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs was confirmed in her rank, and Ferdinand was received as the the ſixth marquis de Mazzini.</p>
               <p>The marchioneſs, thus reſtored to the world, and to happineſs, reſided with her children in the palace at Naples, where after time had ſomewhat mellowed the
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:029381_0229_0FE0D65604070D38"/>
remembrance of the late calamity, the nuptials of Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politus and Julia were celebrated. The recollection of the difficulties they had encountered, and of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs they had endured for each other, now ſerved only to heighten by contraſt the happineſs of the preſent period.</p>
               <p>Ferdinand ſoon after accepted a command in the Neapolitan army; and amidſt the many heroes of that warlike and turbulent age, diſtinguiſhed himſelf for his valour and ability. The occupations of war engaged his mind, while his heart was occupied in promoting the happineſs of his family.</p>
               <p>Madame de Menon, whoſe generous attachment to the marchioneſs had been fully proved, found in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration of her friend a living witneſs of her marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and thus recovered thoſe eſtates which had been unjuſtly with-held from her. But the marchioneſs and her family, grateful to her friendſhip, and attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to her virtues, prevailed upon her to ſpend the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of her life at the palace of Mazzini.</p>
               <p>Emilia, wholly attached to her family, continued to reſide with the marchioneſs, who ſaw her race renewed in the children of Hippolitus and Julia. Thus ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by her children and friends, and engaged in forming the minds of the infant generation, ſhe ſeemed to forget that ſhe had ever been otherwiſe than happy."</p>
               <p>Here the manuſcript annals conclude. In review<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this ſtory, we perceive a ſingular and ſtriking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of moral retribution. We learn alſo, that thoſe who do only THAT WHICH IS RIGHT, endure nothing in misfortune but a trial of their virtue, and from trials well endured, derive the ſureſt claim to the protection of heaven.</p>
