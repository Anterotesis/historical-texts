            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
               <p>WHEN the rulers of a free people preſume to overleap the bounds of law; when they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon the credulity of honeſt men who have not, ſome, the capacity, others, the means, of information; when every ſtratagem of knavery and cunning is ſpread to enſnare the weal of ſimple innocence; when the gorgeous fabrick of civil and religious liberty, which has been reared upon the bones, cemented with the blood of patriots, is tottering to its fall, his muſt be ſure a cold or coward heart, which ſwells not as with aſpick's tongues. Let rogues and ſycophants indulge themſelves in the unhallowed rites of baſe idolatry, worſhipping the mimic godhead greatneſs which they have faſhioned; but let the hardy, true republican raiſe up a warning voice to the miſguided multitude, that they defile them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:031803_0003_0FEE73EF48D8D8C8"/>no more with vile pollutions. For me, I ſhall not heſitate to develope principles however veiled beneath the maſk of power: and for the unbluſhing tribe of upſtart courtiers, whether ſwollen with the poiſon of ambition, or baſely ducking to the lordly brow, I hold their anger as my ſport: I execrate the wretch who treads upon the helpleſs neck of innocence, I ſcorn the worm that crawls beneath his feet: and, while they cower to the ſcourge of ſatire, let them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joce, ſince they commute for this the tree of infamy they have deſerved.</p>
               <p>The Britiſh faction in America having thrown the republic into a ſtate of civil animoſity and diſunion at home, and peril from the hoſtility of long eſtabliſhed friendſhip abroad, and the treaty of amity and commerce with Great Britain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the peſtilent ſource of theſe diſorders, it is a natural ſuggeſtion that we ſhould attempt to rid ourſelves of this deteſted box of evils, returning it with loathing to the Pandora of this latter age.</p>
               <p>Aſſuming it as a datum that the treaty is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable inſtrument, nor ſhall I ſtrive to illumin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate a ſun-beam, let us proceed to the examination of ſuch principles as may preſent themſelves, and which would authorize a republican congreſs to ſpurn this inſtrument in the duſt.</p>
               <p>By the conſtitution, the congreſs is veſted with the power of regulating commerce: by this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er they have an opportunity of interrupting our intercourſe with Britain, and ſpringing a mine under the very baſis of the treaty; thereby ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering us reſpectable to the Britiſh monarchy,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:031803_0004_0FEE73F48F409250"/>and once more dear to the French republick. That it is juſt to contravene the treaty I ſhall firſt endeavour to eſtabliſh; afterwards that it is expedient: and in ſpeaking of the expediency of the meaſure, I ſhall make ſome neceſſary remarks upon the late meaſures of the government of France.</p>
               <p>Firſt of the juſtice of the propoſed meaſure: and in the courſe of this diſcuſſion I ſhall, as much as may be, adhere to the authority of a writer, to whom the miniſtry have, in their reaſonings, conſtantly diſcovered a decided preference.</p>
               <p>But before we reſort to any other authority, let us appeal to that of the conſtitution itſelf, no militation with which, it is apprehended, will be adventured even by thoſe hardy champions who have ſet at nought the proudeſt bulwarks of truth, and have made incurſions upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of common ſenſe itſelf.</p>
               <p>I ſhall ſay nothing of thoſe infractions of the conſtitution, which were made by the adoption of the treaty, as the law of the land, without the conſent of the houſe or repreſentatives. Of this kind were, firſt, the aſſumed powers of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating commerce; ſecond, of eſtabliſhing a rule of naturalization; third, of making all laws neceſſary for carrying into execution any powers veſted by the conſtitution in the general govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Of this kind too is the aſſumed power of granting appropriations of money which more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over makes room for the power to eſtabliſh new federal courts to be paid by congreſs. All theſe points have been ably diſcuſſed elſewhere.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="unknown:031803_0005_0FEE73F6182ECBC0"/>
But even in the preamble itſelf to this illegal inſtrument, it is aſſerted, that the ſenate had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed and conſented to the appointment of Mr. Jay to the negotiation of the ſame. This pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious meaſure, which was never taken, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed directed by the conſtitution; an Mr. Jay's acting without it, was not only and infraction thereof, but ſuch a one as Britain, had ſhe not ſo much reaſon to be pleaſed with the treaty, would not have heſitated at pleaſure to have made her plea for a violation of the compact.</p>
               <p>Congreſs have powers to define and puniſh pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies, but not by any other mean than what is preſcribed by the conſtitution; namely, a trial by jury. But by the 21ſt article of the treaty, the Britiſh are allowed to puniſh an American ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen for piracy, in any mode they ſhall think proper. Of the woful influence which this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle has had upon the politicks of the French we ſhall ſpeak hereafter.</p>
               <p>Moreover congreſs are not in poſſeſſion of any powers not expreſsly granted by the conſtitution; they had therefore no right to prohibit a citizen from expatriating himſelf at pleaſure; they might indeed refuſe to readmit him as a citizen when ſo expatriated; but to detain him againſt his will, or puniſh him for the freedom of his actions abroad, was a ſpecies of tyranny not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by the uſurped domination of an Eaſtern deſpot: It was nothing leſs than to cut him off from the laſt reſort of an indignant hero, who ſhould exclaim with Sidney,
<q>
                     <l>Manus haec inimica tyrannis</l>
                     <l>Enſe petit placidam ſublibertate quietem.</l>
                  </q>
                  <pb n="5" facs="unknown:031803_0006_0FEE73F79F871B20"/>Beſides it is expreſsly declared (in the 7th article of the amendment to the conſtitution) that no perſon ſhall beheld to anſwer for a capital or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe infamous crime, unleſs on a preſentment or indictment by a grand jury, except in caſes ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in the land or naval forces, or in the mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, while in actual ſervice, in time of war or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic danger; nor be deprived of <hi>life, liberty</hi> or <hi>property,</hi> without due courſe of law. Now a man who has expatriated himſelf, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently is no longer a citizen of the country he chooſes to abandon forever, is not only unjuſtly deprived of his <hi>liberty</hi> in the firſt inſtance, but of his <hi>life</hi> if he attempt to regain his liberty (that is to indulge his will by entering into a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign ſervice) and all this too without the <hi>due courſe of law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It has been denied (and I have not ſeen it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) that congreſs has a legal right to alienate its powers. Congreſs we know is veſted with the power of regulating trade, and may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore co-operate with the executive in the fabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of a treaty. But becauſe this may be done in inſtances which particularly affect the intereſts of the nation, and to the extent that the negotiation of treaties uſually demands, does it follow, that it is conſiſtent with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, in thoſe momentous inſtances which touch the very vitals of the government? Does it follow, that becauſe one congreſs, by virtue of its authority in regulating trade, has paſſed laws for the purpoſe of creating a treaty, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther congreſs, under circumſtances of imperious
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:031803_0007_0FEE73F9264BFC50"/>neceſſity too, ſhall not, by virtue of the ſame authority to regulate trade, now devolved upon them, be at liberty to repeal theſe pernicious acts? A writer, above alluded to, cites ſome expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Mr. Maddiſon (uſed, I believe, in the convention of Virginia, for the purpoſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling the audience to the treaty making pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er). They are to this effect: That the treaty making power was never intended to warrant any part of the legiſlature in an act for diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering any part of the empire, or alienating any eſſential right; and that the whole legiſlative au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority poſſeſs not this power. <hi>The exerciſe of the power (ſays he) muſt be conſiſtent with the object of the delegation.</hi>—Now one object of the delegation of the treaty making power, was the improvement of commerce; but it certainly never was deſigned that commerce ſhould be erected upon the ruins of legiſlation, much leſs that partial commercial advantages ſhould be purchaſed at ſo dear a rate.</p>
               <p>Vattel ſays (and we ſhould have known it had he not ſaid it) that whenever a miniſter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the inſtructions of his ſovereign, a treaty is void. He ſays, moreover, if I miſtake not, that the violation of a ſingle important article of a treaty abrogates the whole.</p>
               <p>Now the ſovereign of a free government is the people; and the inſtructions of this ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign are contained in the conſtitution they have cauſed to be compoſed: but we have ſeen above, that theſe inſtructions have been exceeded in ſeveral important particulars; and had they
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:031803_0008_0FEE73FAAF1B72C0"/>been exceeded only in the ſolitary inſtance, in which Mr. Jay has made a treaty without the previous advice of the ſenate; it is evident, that this deluſive preamble, itſelf, would have been ſufficient to annihilate every article of the treaty which accompanies it, although each had been modelled as correctly, and as ſcrupulouſly, by the dictates of the conſtitution, as they are in many inſtances moſt impudently forged in evident defiance and contempt of its authority.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
               <p>SUCH reaſonings, as the foregoing, it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended are ſufficient, and even ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, to the purpoſe of convincing the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Britiſh treaty, that it is unwarrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the conſtitution: and we have long ſince experienced, that the friends of Britiſh politicks are impracticable to all the arguments of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican. To ſuch men it would be vain to urge, that in the conſtruction of an article of the conſtitution, when an ambiguity occurs, that meaning ſhould prevail, which is moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable to the intereſts of a republican govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But were we even to admit the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutionality of the inſtrument, principles could ſtill be found, which would militate as power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully againſt its claim to our eſteem.</p>
               <p>It is declared by the miſchievous fabricators of the treaty, which we have entered into with our enemies, againſt the intereſts of our aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:031803_0009_0FEE7402743A7008"/>friends, that America had it not in her choice, at that time, by any other means, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate a war with Britain. This treaty then, with our brother and good ally, king George the IIId, who had already cut the throats of an hundred thouſand of our fathers and brothers, this treaty of true and ſincere friendſhip was made, we ſee, under the muzzles of his guns, and at the points of his bayonets. Whether an inſtrument ſo executed, be binding or not upon the weaker party, is a queſtion by no means wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy a conſideration to men who love a ſceptred ruffian; but it ſurely will not fail to give ſome pauſe to thoſe, who love much more the freedom, the happineſs, and the innocence of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
               <p>Vattel (p. 180, large octavo) expreſſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thus, "Though the ſimple injury, or ſome diſadvantage in a treaty, is not ſufficient to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it invalid, the caſe is not the ſame with thoſe inconveniences which lead to the ruin of a ſtate. Since every treaty ought to be made with a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient power, a treaty pernicious to the ſtate is null, and not at all obligatory; no conductor of the nation having the power to enter into en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements to do ſuch things as are capable of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the ſtate, for the ſafety of which the empire is entruſted to him. The nation itſelf being neceſſarily obliged to perform every thing required for its preſervation and ſafety, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter into engagements contrary to its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſible obligations. In the year 1506, the ſtates general of the kingdom of France, aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled

They alſo found, that neither the treaty, nor the oath that had accompanied it, could oblige the king to alienate the dominions of the crown."</p>
               <p>Now if a treaty, which has for its object the impoveriſhment of a country, by the impoſition of the hardeſt conditions; if a treaty (entered into by a monarchy with a republick) which evidently tends by the unqualified, unalterable intercourſe eſtabliſhed thereby, to the utter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation of republican principles, if a treaty of monopoly and foreign influence may be ſaid to lead to the ruin of ſuch a government, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples laid down by Vattel give ample warrant to a rejection of the Britiſh treaty; nor will any zealous commonwealth's man, any man whoſe blood has chilled with horror at the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom of Sydney, or boiled with indignation at the intemperate claims of a Stuart, or Brunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick, one moment heſitate to pronounce that deed a curſed compact for his country's down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal. I will even venture to aſk any ſenſible and candid man, how great ſoever his zeal in Britiſh politicks, whether he ſeriouſly believes the king and parliament of England would not tear into a thouſand pieces any inſtrument, ſigned under the preſſure of the occaſion, if they ſaw each article operating to their injury; and whether they would even give the queſtion but a ſecond thought, when they had foreſeen this inſtrument <hi>would probably introduce into their dominions, the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:031803_0011_0FEE74058594F480"/>principles of republican government.</hi> Let thoſe who know the object of the preſent bloody and expenſive war with the French republick, deny this doctrine if they can.</p>
               <p>How entirely different from the maxims of Britiſh policy, are the principles laid down by Vattel, in the buſineſs of conſtructing treaties. After ſpeaking of the propriety of preſerving a reciprocity of advantage in ſuch contracts, he adds, "I ſee thoſe pretended great politicians ſmile, who place all their ſubtilty in circumven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thoſe with whom they treat; and regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the conditions of the treaty in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that all the advantage ſhall accrue to their maſters. Far from bluſhing at a conduct ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to equity, to rectitude, and natural honor, they make it their glory, and pretend to merit the name of great negociators. How do men in a public character glory in what would diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor an individual? The private man, if he is without conſcience, alſo laughs at the rules of morality and juſtice; but he laughs in ſecret; it would be dangerous and prejudicial to him, publickly to make a mock of them. The pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful abandon more openly the honeſt for the uſeful. But it frequently happens, for the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the human race, that this pretended utility becomes fatal to them, and even among ſovereigns candour and rectitude are found to be their ſafeſt politicks. All the ſubtilties, all the ſhufflings of a famous miniſter, on occaſion of a very intereſting treaty with reſpect to Spain, turned at length to his confuſion, and the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of his maſter; while the good faith, the generoſity of England, towards her allies, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:031803_0012_0FEE74070D1BAAC8"/>her an immenſe credit, and raiſed her to the higheſt point of influence and reſpect."</p>
               <p>The compliment to Britain, which cloſes this paſſage, we know, by bitter experience, how long ſhe has ceaſed to deſerve; and againſt it the reaſon of every American republican muſt revolt, whether he reflects on the helliſh conſpiracy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the precious rights of human nature, which was formed by the combined powers, or whether he looks back upon a few of the latter pages of Engliſh hiſtory, and contemplates there atrocities againſt his countrymen, compared to which, the crimes of Roberſpierre himſelf would turn to whiteneſs. It is evident, indeed, from the boaſts of Mr. Pitt himſelf in parliament, that he piqued himſelf upon his inſidious artifices, and that inſtead of relaxing the oppreſſive bonds, which bind our hands, it was his deſign to ſlight no opportunity to draw the ſtricture tighter.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
               <p>ONLY into exiſting treaties need we caſt our eyes, to know how liberal and friendly were the wiſhes and deſigns of that nation, againſt which the tools and incendiaries of Britiſh poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in America, are endeavouring, with unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampled acrimony and induſtry, to kindle our reſentment. The following are the words of the ſecond article of the treaty of alliance even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and defenſive with France:</p>
               <p>"The eſſential and direct end of the preſent defenſive alliance is to maintain effectually the liberty, ſovereignty, and independence, abſolute
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:031803_0013_0FEE740D932F0A90"/>and unlimited of the ſaid United States, as well in matters of government as of commerce."</p>
               <p>The following is article the 9th:</p>
               <p>"The contracting parties declare that, being reſolved to fulfil, each on its own part, the clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and conditions in the preſent treaty of alliance, according to its own powers and circumſtances, there ſhall be no after claim of compenſation, on one ſide or the other, whatever may be the event of the war.</p>
               <p>"The moſt chriſtian king renounces forever the poſſeſſion of the iſland of Bermuda, as well as of any part of the continent of North-Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, which, before the treaty of Paris, in 1763, or in virtue of that treaty, were acknowledged to belong to the crown of Great Britain, or to the United States, heretofore called Britiſh co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, or which are at this time, or have late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been under the power of Great-Britain."</p>
               <p>Thus do we ſee that we were to loſe nothing, and might gain immenſely by the French alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, the direct purpoſe thereof being the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of the independence of America, while the manifeſt, unequivocal, ſyſtematick, deſign of the Britiſh treaty is its deſtruction. When, after all theſe inſtances of ſervice, a French miniſter applied to your ſecretary at war for the loan of arms for their defence, what was his reply? that "the French government would not be ſupplied with ſo much as a ſingle piſtol." Would not the Britiſh government, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch circumſtances, and in the inſolence of monarchy have demanded inſtantly, that we ſhould join their arms, that we ſhould not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry grain into an enemy's port, but ſhould bring
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:031803_0014_0FEE740F1AD97960"/>it to their own? Nay, did ſhe not do this at laſt, and will ſhe not do it again, if ever another fooliſh and wicked hope is entertained that France can be ſtarved? Does any man of honor ſay he doubts this? No not one. Whether we were right in giving no aſſiſtance to France ſhall not be diſcuſſed here; but at leaſt let not this boaſted neutrality of the treaty adminiſtration be applauded by us, becauſe an enraged party in the Britiſh houſe of commons, wiſhing to exalt American policy at the expence of Mr. Pitt, thought proper to applaud it. Mr. Fox and Mr. Sheridan applauded what would ſerve their country: they deprecated a war with America. Did theſe gentlemen arraign the policy of the American government, when, in its infatuated and moſt miſchievous devotion to Britain, an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious treaty was executed with that power, which proſtrated at her feet the honor and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of America, the intereſts of France, and put at hazard the future ſervices of ſo firm a friend, with the evident peril of converting her, by this act, into a moſt virulent, as ſhe would, of courſe, be a moſt powerful foe? Certainly they did not. By the neutrality Britain was to proſper, and they were pleaſed of courſe; but when they found we had meanly deſerted the French, and thrown ourſelves into the arms of Britain, they knew they would proſper more, and were therefore ſtill better pleaſed.</p>
               <p>But it may be ſaid the French, whatever they have been, are no longer our friends, and that it has become our duty as patriots, and men of honor, to enter into a conflict with them. Let us look into this buſineſs and then we will return
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:031803_0015_0FEE7410A2547B90"/>to the Britiſh, and the tendency of their treaty, and their politicks.</p>
               <p>Three charges are brought againſt the French government: 1ſt, That it has plundered our trade. 2d, That it has refuſed to receive our miniſter. 3d, That it has reſolved, in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Britiſh, to treat as a pirate, every American ſeaman that ſhall be found aboard of the enemy's ſhips.</p>
               <p>For the firſt of theſe charges it has been falſe from firſt to laſt; the ſpoliations committed both in Europe and America never having, as we have any reaſon to believe, been authorized by the executive of France. This point, ſo far as relates to Europe, is proved by Coſſin's letter to the directory, demanding permiſſion for the French merchants to cruiſe againſt the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican trade. What at laſt has the directory done to embarraſs your commerce? They have allowed their armed veſſels to bring in neutral ſhips ſuſpected of containing enemy's property, and have ordered, that as ſoon as the condemned property is diſembarked, the veſſel ſhall be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to depart with full compenſation for freight and detention. This, I apprehend, is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſtate of the buſineſs, encumbered, no doubt, with ſome inconvenient regulations. Compare this with the plunder of the Britiſh, and it will appear but as the teazing of a fly, compared with the ravening of a tiger.</p>
               <p>The ſecond charge which is to reconcile us to a war with men who ſo long continued to love us, is, that, becauſe they thought we loved them no more, they ſaid to our miniſter, "Depart; you are not our friend, you give us no ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:031803_0016_0FEE7412292BAC40"/>proofs of affection; you give us words in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but words are air; you wiſh to give us more words, but our enemies you uphold with deeds; nay us you have agreed to ſtarve." This charge is frivolous: it is diſguſting to unravel the woof of paſſion; to break a ſpider's web is not the taſk of manhood.</p>
               <p>We come now to the moſt weighty, the moſt momentous charge of all; the directory have ordered your ſeamen, taken in arms againſt them, while the two nations are at peace, to be treated as pirates. In this what do they but imitate the example of the Britiſh, authorized by yourſelves in a treaty, which, intimidated, as it is confeſſed on all hands, by the influence of the Britiſh na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in an evil hour, your rulers debaſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by forming. After all then, what is the purpoſe of the French government in the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the very worſt of the meaſures we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of? Self-defence; the very purpoſe for which it is declared we took thoſe previous ſteps which led to theſe.</p>
               <p>Let us but retrace the ground we have trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and the French will do the ſame, and we ſhall both regain the poſt we have loſt—the poſt of amity and peace.</p>
               <p>Be it however admitted for a moment, that the French have been to blame; yet let not the cenſure fall upon the nation, but upon the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory, the political agents of the nation. Every people, be the form of its governments what it may, muſt, on ſome occaſions, experience the evils of an intemperate, or an unwiſe, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration. The pride or weakneſs of the treaty adminiſtration brought this country into
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:031803_0017_0FEE74188712CA80"/>thoſe embaraſſments, which ſo puzzle the will in the election of the leſſer evil. To quarrel with a nation on account of its ruling adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration (unleſs the form of the government al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows no change to the aggrieved citizens) is to encourage one bad adminiſtration to provoke another for inſidious purpoſes, which very thing (ſuppoſing that of the French had been a bad one) would appear to have been done in ſeveral late American tranſactions; more eſpecially in the late laboured miſchief of Mr. Secretary Pickering. If the rulers have been faulty, let it not be ſaid as of old,
<q>Dum delirant reges plectunter achivi.</q> But even ſuppoſing the nation of France itſelf to be oppoſed to us, even this is not a ſufficient warrant to the cool, deliberate judgment for us to become their enemies who have been ſo long their friends, or (which to the heart of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is more) <hi>we to whom they</hi> have ſo long been friends. Firſt, without more information than falls to the ſhare of the million, the French people might eaſily fall into the error of believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the American people were their enemies, ſince our government has given the fulleſt teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of a rooted hate. Secondly, in publick, as in private, friendſhip, he is moſt a hero who forbears the moſt. Between long eſtabliſhed friends, as Americans and Frenchmen, forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance leads to reconciliation; between long eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed foes, as Americans and Britons, forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance leads to arrogance in one, to meanneſs in the other. Which is beſt, to yield ſomething to a long tried friend, or be the ſhallow dupe of an inveterate national enemy, and her vile or wicked
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:031803_0018_0FEE741A18736E10"/>agents, and adherents, in the very heart of your government.</p>
               <p>But after all what is it the French deſire that you ſhould do? To abandon certain articles of a treaty, which has been made in deſpight of the mandates of your conſtitution, and which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ought to be your moſt ardent wiſh, and unalterable purpoſe, immediately to abandon in toto. Will it be ſaid that we ſhould heſitate to take this ſtep, leſt we ſhould incur the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of timidity? If we have not already incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this imputation, by a moſt ignoble ſubmiſſion in the adoption of the Britiſh treaty, are we likely now to do ſo by a reaſonable and honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble compromiſe with diſguſted friends? In pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate life does a man of honor heſitate to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge an offence, if he has offended? or to repair an injury if he has injured? And does he not theſe things with the greater readineſs, in proportion to the eſtabliſhment of his reputation? Do Americans feel themſelves ſuſpected? Will not the character of their valour <hi>afford</hi> an apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy? Will not their achievements in the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution war, bear them out of a diſpute without a battle? Is it not evident, that by the confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of error, we ſhall moſt effectually aſſert our national honor? Let the treaty be abandoned, as it ought, upon the principle of national in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; let the meaſure be declared neceſſary to the legal adminiſtration of the government, and the independence of the republick; then it ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will be no objection to this act that it will be agreeable to the French. Rid yourſelves of your thraldom, not becauſe the French wiſh it, but becauſe it becomes you as men of ſpirit. Would
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:031803_0019_0FEE741BA47CC260"/>you do a wrong thing, merely becauſe the French have hoped you would do a right one? Had we acted rightly in the firſt inſtance, we ſhould not have been called to do ſo now. Nay, if after the rejection of one miniſter, the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of another ſhould become a queſtion, even this would be no objection to the abandonment of the treaty. If violations of the conſtitution are tolerated in caſes which militate againſt the publick weal, how familiar will the violations become in caſes which preſent ſome partial good? And how ſoon ſhall we have no conſtitution at all? It has been matter of curioſity to ſee in governments, where liberty has been yielded up in deſpair, how inſurrections have taken place from the moſt trifling impoſitions; as when a king of Spain attempted to regulate the dreſs of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; or a king of France, or England, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive the citizens of a publick walk: yet even in thoſe ſtates, which are eminently free, the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping multitude can gaze with ſilent inactivity, when deſigns, which cannot be miſtaken, againſt their moſt precious rights, are in daily progreſs and maturation. Philip would have met with more prompt and formidable oppoſition from the people of Athens, had he threatened to ſuppreſs their favorite ſpectacles, than he did when he advanced to ſubvert the republick.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
               <p>BUT the truth is, that we are now brought into a poſition in which we can no longer temporize, but muſt take up ſome part, either
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:031803_0020_0FEE741D2CA2C5E8"/>much more abject than any played even in the treaty drama, or much more manly and deciſive than the wretched actors in thoſe wretched ſcenes, ever hoped to ſee us execute. We muſt, forthwith, accommodate ourſelves to one of three things: 1ſt, To ſee our ſeamen preſſed by the Engliſh government, and then hanged by the French: or 2dly, we muſt fight the nation of France: or 3dly, we muſt abandon the Britiſh treaty. By this laſt meaſure, I apprehend, we ſhall be in no danger of being oppreſſed by, or fighting, either.</p>
               <p>Now after all that has been ſaid, about the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation of being under the influence of French politicks, in any degree, even the ſmalleſt, (for we have ſeen that very little has been attempted, and <hi>that</hi> in their own defence, and to no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment of ours,) let me aſk, is there any weak nation, that is not, in ſome meaſure, under the guidance of its ſtronger neighbour? There ſeems ſcarcely an inſtance to the contrary, but in the little republick of St. Marino, which is perched like an eagle's neſt amidſt the clouds. And indeed it is remarkable, that as the French are anxious, in all inſtances, to propagate the principles of republican government, or in other words, as will be believed by all but the Britiſh faction among us, the principles of permanent freedom, ſo in the inſtance even of the unim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant eſtabliſhment we ſpeak of, they did not diſdain to pauſe, amidſt their great career, to ſpeak their kindneſs. But let me aſk; does not your treaty with Great Britain, now rule your politicks with a rod of iron? France wiſhes you to conſult her views, in one inſtance, wherein
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:031803_0021_0FEE742265A1C230"/>it is your evident intereſt and glory to comply; England, that you ſhould truckle to her will, in every inſtance, which now, or ever may exiſt: yet you are indignant at the attempt of a nation ſo long your friend, to break thoſe bonds. No man deprecates, more fervently than I, the prevalence of foreign influence; yet, where a certain portion is inevitably to be ſuſtained, ſurely that is to be preferred, which, from the habitual attachments, and character of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, may be expected to act with ſuperior mildneſs. France, we ſee, is powerful, and loves republican governments; while England, if ſhe is powerful, is alſo inimical to republicks; and ſhould ſhe be a republick tomorrow, and prior claims of the French upon our ſervices ſtood not in the way, moſt willingly ought we to forget all the animoſities which prevail under the monarchy, and join our friendly hands. As to the point of accommodation with a ſuperior nation, it ought to be remembered, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the diſtance of our country from the republick of France, the condition of the peaſantry of the ſouthern ſtates, renders one half of the union extremely feeble, and this weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is encreaſed by the complexion of French politicks in this particular. Were every man in America a freeman, we might encounter France with ſome proſpect of ſucceſs; but where a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict is evidently hopeleſs, it is not fear, but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which ſhould decline it; it is not valour, but madneſs, which ſhould attempt it. The Britiſh navy, if it remains (and whether it will long ſurvive the palſy of the bank of England may very well be queſtioned) may injure us in
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:031803_0022_0FEE742535C9E5C0"/>the ſpoil of ſuch property as we may chooſe to venture on the ſeas, (for the meaneſt tool of Britain thinks her not capable of a ſecond terrene war;) but the potency of myriads of heroes, fluſhed with unexampled victories, who ſhall attempt to calculate. Does not every man of ſenſe ſee too, that, ſince their late ſucceſſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the emperor and the Italian ſtates, the French ſhortly "muſt ſheath their ſwords for lack of argument;" then, ſhould the directory be covetous of glory, as their enemies aſſert, where can they wave their banners with greater gain of territory than on the weſtern ſhores of the Atlantic; and while they are diſbanding one half of their army in the Eaſt, who ſhall declare, that if we become their enemies, they will not, with the other half, attempt to plant another empire in the weſt? In ſuch a caſe who doubts that they would delight in an opportunity of crippling the trade of Britain in America, upon the ſame principles of ſelf-preſervation which carried them into the territory of Italy. Who then ſhall fight your battles? The weſtern pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantry are out of the attraction of Britiſh policy, and love the French. While ſuch are the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits of the French, be it alſo our part, in like manner, to adopt the principles of ſelf-preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, founded too, as they ſurely are, upon the principles of national honor and dignity. The Britiſh, we ſee manifeſtly, cannot ſubdue the French; but what if the French ſubdue the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh, the preciousally of the treaty adminiſtration? What, under ſuch circumſtances of imbecility, as above deſcribed, will be the ſituation of the ſouthern ſtates, more eſpecially, ſunk as they
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:031803_0023_0FEE7426C1A1ADC8"/>will be by the combined oppreſſions of diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, ingratitude, and deſpair? Let the French land when they will in the ſouthern ſtates, whether before or after the conqueſt of England, whether before or after the attainment of the Floridas, at that ill-fated hour thoſe ſtates will be diſmembered from thoſe of the north, and eaſt, and weſt. Then will the northern ſtates, if not likewiſe ſubdued by the French, ſink, without hope of reſurrection, into the deep abyſs of Britiſh politicks; for the influence of it is baleful and univerſal as its reach; like the dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtar, it falls with indiſcriminate rage upon every nation in all the regions of the habitable globe, and upon every tribe. But of this more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="5" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
               <p>IF, as has been urged, the Britiſh treaty is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtitutional, (and this is a point not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted, that I know of, even by its patrons) and if it is at variance with the laws of nations, it will ſurely not be objected to the abandonment thereof, that our national faith will be violated. On the contrary, this happy conſequence will reſult from the meaſure; it will put intriguing nations upon their guard, in future, that they make no compact with flagitious rulers in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, when her laws do not uphold their acts. And what, let me aſk, ſhall we abandon in the treaty? The greateſt curſe (formed by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of curſes,) that ever viſited an incau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, oppreſſed, diſhonored nation. It is not
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:031803_0024_0FEE742ACC168350"/>misfortune, but ruin; nay it is worſe, it is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation. The treaty is not one of many evils which like congregating ſtreams fill up a mighty torrent to burſt upon its hapleſs neighbours; it is an earthquake, which with wide and waſteful bane, yawns to engorge the nation. Why did we ſurrender our birthright to thoſe haughty lordlings, even while their kingdom was totter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its fall? Nor did we gain a meſs of pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in return. Inſtead of drawing tighter the bonds of union, we ſhould have rent aſunder the ignominious miſchief, like Sampſon in his ſtrength, and not have ſuffered this Britiſh trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to enſlave our limbs. By acts of alienation, and not by ties of friendſhip, have we four times been reſcued from the graſp of Britain: in two inſtances by the non-importation agreements which followed the ſtamp and tea acts; in two others by the declaration of independence, and the treaty of alliance with France; which two inſtruments eſtabliſhed our empire. Have we not formed a league with our implacable foe, as monſtrous as between a tyger and a lamb? for the character of monarchy, of Britain above all monarchies, is bloody and ravening; the character of repreſentative government is peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and unoffending. The laws of nations, themſelves, even when a <hi>legal</hi> treaty is formed, between a monarchy and a republick, give the former immenſe advantages over the latter. Vattel makes a diſtinction between a <hi>perſonal</hi> and a <hi>real</hi> alliance; the former, he ſays, "ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires with him who contracted it;" the latter "is affixed to the body of the ſtate, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts as long as the ſtate; if the time of its du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:031803_0025_0FEE742D97C4A3F8"/>is not limitted. He then ſubjoins, "eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry alliance made by a republick is in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture real, for it relates only to the body of the ſtate. When a free people, a popular ſtate, or an ariſtocratical republick, concludes a treaty, it is the ſtate itſelf that contracts; and its en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements do not depend on the lives of thoſe who were only the inſtruments: the members of the people, or of the regency, change and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed each other; but the ſtate is always the ſame." If then republicks always remain bound, while monarchies may, in ſome caſes, be let off from their engagements, it is evident that ſuch treaties ſhould not, but in caſes of inevitable neceſſity, to be entered into. The ſame writer adds, "when kings make treaties, and it is doubtful whether they be real or perſonal, they ſhould be ſuppoſed to be only perſonal, if ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely burdenſome to one party." But burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome as this treaty is to the people, though light as the goſsamer to the adminiſtration which have given it birth, yet, becauſe our government is a republick, we, had it been a legal act, muſt ſtill have born the weight forever, though we ſhould have groaned like Atlas beneath the world; whereas a treaty which had been found an encumbrance to Britain, might, in many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, have been got rid of as a perſonal one, by her, by the death of a prince. In monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies too we find there is no publick faith but what is founded on convenience; we ought not to have made a treaty with the French monarchy, but that it ſeemed the only mean by which to hope for the eſtabliſhment of our freedom. We have now, on the contrary, entered into a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:031803_0026_0FEE742F1F63A8E8"/>which will make us ſlaves. The confidence which men of obſervation place in monarchs is ſo ſmall, that the only reaſon why we could hope to avoid the evils of a par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="6 letters">

When, too, we have ſeen kings, and the miniſters of kings, bowing their humbled heads beneath the laurels of Rome and Paris, and when nothing but the preſervation of our principles is needful to the ſame aſcenſion, ſhall we meanly ſeek relation to theſe the meaneſt, and moſt hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of mankind, the fooliſh, and the wicked? What ſecurity have we from a government which has been faithleſs to its own citizens? A while the liberty, as well as the property, or an <hi>indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual</hi> Engliſhman was left inviolate, to maſk the aſſaſſins of the <hi>publick</hi> weal. The French re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution, it was feared, would redeem the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and the property of the citizens, both publick and private; private liberty has therefore been invaded in the perſons of ſome daring patriots; and the like will be the fate of private property, as ſoon as the exigencies of the ſtate, and the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licities of opportunity, ſhall preſent themſelves together. If thus they treat the citizens of their own immediate government, their friends and brethren, what ſhall we expect? We whom they view but as refractory ſubjects? Certainly that they will keep no terms with ſuch. Do we not know that a flagrant violation of faith hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:031803_0027_0FEE7430A4E298B0"/>after the capitulation of Charleſton, when they ſaid they would not fulfil compacts made with rebels? What though they ſince have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the independence of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? That would aſſuredly but weigh with them as lightly as any other principle of honor or good faith: they would allege, that they made their compact through neceſſity: a neceſſity ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing out of their deſigns upon our liberty; and they would deride our claims accordingly. Who doubts the readineſs of Spain to reſume the long relinquiſhed ſovereignty of Holland? To what end are even the laws of nations reſorted to by princes, when the laws of nature have been vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olated? Is it not, as Satan quotes ſcripture for his purpoſe? Camillus, to obtain our favor for the treaty, points out ſome arrogant demands which Britain had forborn in conſequence of the treaty. And will the treaty make this ſpoiler modeſt? It will as ſoon tranſmute Corinthian braſs to gold, or die with virgin bluſhes the ghaſtly, pallid cheek of veteran guilt. The ſame writer tells us the treaty was made to ſecure us from a war. Great care might have been expected to be taken in this treaty to ſecure us from a war, when the beſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity from that grievous burden, and no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable fund for its ſupport, were ſurrendered by the treaty; But who ſhall ſecure us from a war with perfidy? Can honor agree with infamy? Humanity with barbariſm? Are not political e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normities even familiar to that government? Have we forgot already the dungeons and priſon ſhips of the revolution? Cruelties committed where there was no retaliation, and (mean as atrocious!) <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi> there was no retaliation. If then it was
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:031803_0028_0FEE74371BF4AD60"/>likely we muſt have a war at laſt, and that we could only repoſe ourſelves in peace and infamy, better had it been to have had this war at firſt: then ſhould we not only have preſerved thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources in wealth which are ſpoken of above, but we ſhould alſo have preſerved the attachment of our friends, and probably been included by their good offices in that peace which Britain is about to ſue for at the feet of France. Whether ſuch acts of friendſhip are ſtill to be expected from them, ſhould we require and deſerve them, will not admit of doubt. How much better had it been to have braved the fury of this Britiſh lion, or this Britiſh ſhark? Would not the memory of former miſcarriages have checked the ravings even of Britiſh arrogance? Surely no nation, baffled and confounded as Britain has been in her attempts to cruſh the germs of liberty, both in America and France, had ever better reaſon, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of expecting an advantageous treaty from America, to dread her ſmiting hand, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim with the vanquiſhed Trojan:

               <p>IN ſome of the foregoing reaſonings, we have enquired, whether it would be honorable, and (if we wiſh to preſerve the purity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican principles) whether it would be pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to quarrel with an old friend, againſt whom we feel a ſudden diſguſt, and to connect our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with a long eſtabliſhed foe. We did not
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:031803_0029_0FEE7438A32BFF70"/>then enter into the queſtion, whether this foe could, or could not afford us the ſupport which we once received from the friend we have lately loſt.</p>
               <p>In familiar diſcourſe, when we are diſpoſed to mark an immenſe diſproportion between two objects, we are apt to ſay there is no compariſon between them. Upon this principle we will forbear to ſpeak of the reſpective achievements of the two military nations, between whom it may become neceſſary that we ſhould make an election, for the purpoſe of a defenſive alliance.</p>
               <p>Within twenty years the Britiſh government has twice been engaged in war; and the unqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable object of either conteſt, has been the extinguiſhment of republicaniſm, and the fall of liberty. In theſe unhallowed attempts Britain has expended two hundred millions ſterling; and her national bank has at laſt ſtopped payment; a calamity, which, until it was felt, was depreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as the ſureſt ſource of univerſal ruin. The two modes, by which the expences of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic buſineſs of Britain are defrayed, are theſe: Taxation and loans; but taxes are paid in bank notes, and ſo is the intereſt of loans. Now if the value of bank notes is loſt, what will be the value of taxes? and who will lend money to government?</p>
               <p>But as ſome doubt may be entertained, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, notwithſtanding an occaſional ſtoppage of payment, the bank may not yet be in a flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condition, let us advert to ſome late tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions of the Britiſh government, relative to the buſineſs we now ſpeak of.</p>

By an order of council, abſolute and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional, advocated by the plea of ſad neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, the bank of England is ſuddenly forbidden to iſſue ſpecie. What is the immediate conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence? The credit of the bank is impaired, the notes depreciate. Do the directors of the bank hereupon remonſtrate with the council, and demand permiſſion to change their notes as uſual, that they may reſtore their credit? No: they do no more than tell the people, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral terms, that the bank remains in a ſtate of proſperity. Do the people believe the tale? Ignorance itſelf, made drunk, would not believe it.</p>
               <p>What ſcene of this inimitable farce comes next? The miniſter propoſes, that a committee of the houſe of commons be appointed to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine into the cauſes of the late meaſure of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and to aſcertain the ſtability of public credit. Well; this committee are to return into the houſe of commons, and, that the minds of men may be ſet at reſt about the public credit, the committee are to report what they have ſeen at the bank; are they not? Nothing like it, good citizen of England; the miniſter tells you, you are ſatisfied already; and does not he know beſt? Do but hear his words: "When this commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee was appointed, it would be evident that it was not for the purpoſe of aſcertaining, <hi>what indeed had already been aſcertained by publick opinion,</hi> the ſolidity of the bank of England; but to confirm that impreſſion by the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputable evidence." Would not any one ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that this man was, to the very laſt hour, picking the pockets of the publick, and, at the
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:031803_0031_0FEE743BB1B4CAE0"/>ſame time, like the man who promiſed to jump into a quart bottle, meditating his eſcape with the plunder? This new principle of confirming, by new evidence, what was not before believed, is perhaps the ſtrangeſt that has ever been adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, even by the brazen hardihood of a Britiſh miniſter; and it well may be ſo, for the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion itſelf is without an example. But who are theſe diſciples of Mr. Pitt, who are thus to give <hi>more</hi> faith to unbelievers? They are, in the firſt inſtance, the creatures of his hand; next, they are a committee of <hi>ſecrecy;</hi> and even they themſelves, "may not go into the more minute and delicate branches of the company's tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, provided they certify the grounds of the neceſſity, which juſtified the late meaſure." This, I think, is looking up the bible, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting good chriſtians to believe. Beſides, let us ſuppoſe the committee "ſhall certify the grounds of the neceſſity which juſtified the late meaſure," Does this eſtabliſh the truth of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity of the bank? The beſt ground for ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the emiſſion of ſpecie, I apprehend, is the want of it.</p>
               <p>After theſe notable tranſactions, we may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the curtain will drop upon the cataſtrophe of this tragi-comedy, and there remain, perhaps, till it ſhall riſe again upon a tragedy, wherein not one ſcene of comedy will be introduced.</p>
               <p>An attempt has been made to hoodwink reaſon, by comparing former calamities to that which embarraſſes the Engliſh bank at the preſent criſis. The run on the bank at the time of the Scotch invaſion was a caſe entirely diſtinguiſhed from the preſent: payment was then made, though
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:031803_0032_0FEE74421A26A808"/>ſlowly; beſides, as the cauſe was ſudden and of ſhort duration, ſo alſo was the effect. But the cauſes of the preſent miſchief are the the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe expenditures of ſpecie abroad, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the conſequent alarm of the monied men, who choſe to ſecure in time what caſh they might collect. By what means the travelling guineas will return to England we know not, unleſs the French ſhall bring them to ſupport their armies; and we are then to learn how their diſmayed foe is to ſupport his own. As to the hidden treaſure which has ſunk into the caſkets of the ſubject, the man who ſent it there is not likely to conjure it up again. As to the plan talked of to reſtore credit by a mortgage of real property, both rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and paſſion will revolt at the idea: monied men have been ſupported by the deſpotiſm of the Britiſh government, and they have given their ſupport in turn, till they are like to ſink beneath its weight: warned by this example, and ſafe in their ſafe poſſeſſion, the men who hold the ſoil will not put it to hazard to ſoothe a tyrant's breaſt; but ſtart up in their now unrivalled ſtrength, and brave the ſceptre.</p>
               <p>Another inſtance of the ſtoppage of the bank, which took place in the time of William III. is as little in point. There was, at that time, no immenſe emiſſion of bills to anſwer the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of guineas; a fair acknowledgment of the preſent government, that there is no intention to iſſue any conſiderable number of guineas: beſides, the termination of a war put a period to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick of avarice.</p>
               <p>The natural conſequence of a bank's ſtopping payment is one of theſe; if it remain ſhut,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:031803_0033_0FEE7443B7162470"/>notes will depreciate, we know not to what degree. If ſpecie be again ſent out, demands, of courſe, are made much greater than thoſe which helped to cauſe the ſuſpenſion of its circulation.</p>
               <p>It may perhaps be urged, that a peace may turn the reſources of Britain into a lucrative channel, and fill the bank once more. But does any man of obſervation believe, that the French will make ſuch a peace, as will leave the Britiſh marine in a ſtate to preſerve entire the influence of their military and commercial power? Such a peace as will keep in after check, perhaps in annihilation, the navy and the trade of France?</p>
               <p>If it be urged, that the buſineſs of a nation has before this time been ſuſtained in its opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by a paper currency, let it be remembered, that the money of the American revolution (which by the way did not depreciate, it is ſaid, for the firſt year, while bank notes have depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated the firſt day of their emiſſion,) was ſent forth by degrees, and was employed to defend us againſt a diſtant foe, who fought at a very unequal expence; and it would not at laſt have eſtabliſhed our empire without the aid of France: for it had periſhed before the fall of Yorktown under the arms of the allies; which event put a period to the conteſt with Britain. The French aſſignats depreciated alſo with great ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, and the government was obliged to have recourſe to their immenſe reſources of eighty millions of ſpecie. Beſides, the battles of France have been chiefly carried into the territories of their enemies; an advantage well known to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary men. But the Britiſh have iſſued, in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to their former enormous emiſſions, four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:031803_0034_0FEE744541928EB0"/>millions, with no reſources of treaſure, that we know of, in reſerve. This paper me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium is, perhaps intended to carry on a naval war, which yields no commercial ſpoil to an enemy, with a power, which only a tempeſt could fruſtrate in his deſign to caſt the crown of Ireland beneath the peoples feet; a power, which will ſhortly ſet his foot upon the Britiſh throne, and ſpurn it to the duſt.</p>
               <p>"But (ſay the advocates of the Britiſh fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) we admit the probability of the diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the bank; many thouſands will be ruined, yet will England riſe up in her ſtrength, unen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbered by her weight of debt." This caſe is ſimilar to the old caſe of Antaeus, who was the ſon of the earth, from which he received new vigor at every fall; 'till Hercules, impatient at the conteſt, upraiſed him in the air, and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered his brains in the winds. The fate of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land may not, perhaps, be more auſpicious. If any reaſonings may be called fanciful, they ſurely are ſuch as theſe. When a convulſion ſhall have terminated, ſhall a phyſician promiſe health to the weary patient? But England's reſurrection, if ever ſhe ſhall riſe again from the ruins of the bank, muſt be in the form of a republick. The monied men, who ſhall tumble with the monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, will favor thoſe plans of economy which ſuit the ſtate of an empoveriſhed man: the whole maſs of the needy million will do the ſame. The diſſenters will aſſociate themſelves with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, with thoſe men who will extinguiſh their diſabilities, and give them power, wealth, civil and religious freedom. If then, this republick is to be a liberal one, we have nothing thence
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:031803_0035_0FEE7446C90B6E00"/>to dread, if we ſhall have acted upon the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of republicans: if it ſhall not be liberal, we muſt have reaſon to repent the connexion we have formed with the exiſting monarchy. Beſides, if the preſent ſyſtem is not doomed to ſtand, the Engliſh adminiſtration muſt make their new arrangements under the eye of France; muſt manoeuvre in the preſence of an enemy, who will take advantage of her confuſion, and has long ſought ſo precious an occaſion to cruſh that power, which bound his hands ſo long. Away then forever with theſe Engliſh miniſters! theſe men in iron maſks, whom no one but their keeper knows, and knows them for their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs. For the mean nodding trifler, who dreams of Britiſh faith and power, let him ſtill ſlumber in his paradiſe of fools, 'till with a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's ſcourge the parricide ſhall wake to anguiſh.</p>

               <p>IT is a matter of notoriety, that the clamours of the commercial citizens of America, more eſpecially thoſe of Philadelphia, had no inconſiderable weight in the origination of the treaty. The appropriations for carrying it into effect had been negatived in a committee of the federal houſe of repreſentatives by a majority of twenty, and in a few days after, without any change of circumſtances, but the increaſed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience of thoſe citizens, the appropriations were granted in the houſe itſelf. It is very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural for trading men to wiſh for a connexion with a power, which they fancy to be capable
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:031803_0036_0FEE744D44CEE560"/>of protecting them in their commercial relations, and of offering to their election the great and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried objects of commerce. But let not the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of America be made a ſacrifice to party; nor let liberty be given in barter for the unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, or inexhauſtible mines, of the ſouth. Too long did the late abject and wicked admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration reſt their feeble ſyſtem upon the crutch of avarice; but let the indignant yeoman kick down at length the faithleſs prop, and plant the tree of liberty where it ſtood. In the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of our revolution war, the cities of London and Briſtol recommended to the Britiſh parliament, that the moſt vigorous meaſures ſhould be purſued, and they would give them the fulleſt ſupport. In a year or two after, when they diſcovered that England had not the character of omnipotence, and that their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce was interrupted and deſolated by the war, they preſented their ſecond petitions, praying for an immediate peace. In like manner the commercial faction in America, deprecated at firſt, nothing ſo much as a war with Britain, but if the credit of the bank of England ſhall run its mortal courſe, it is to be expected that theſe gentlemen, as eagerly as the moſt ſtern republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can, will demand the termination of our Britiſh connexions.</p>
               <p>From this ſo coveted commerce with Great Britain, has ſprung the arch terror, the Britiſh treaty; and this monſter ſhall be the mother of others, as multitudinous as the vipers of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica. But when we ſhall feel theſe reptiles' ſting, where ſhall we ſeek the remedy? Will Britain miniſter it? Britain will miniſter nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:031803_0037_0FEE744ECCB05250"/>to the ſerpent. Kill then the preſent monſter 'ere ſhe breed. Cut off, or reduce that pernicious intimacy which gluts the pride of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, while it breaks the ſpirit, while it cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts the morals of America. Can any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe be more unnatural, than that which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riches a foe, provokes a friend, and drains from us the means of reſiſting the attacks of either?</p>
               <p>This brings us to the diſcuſſion of a ſubject, which ſeems hitherto to have occupied much too ſmall a ſhare of the concern and attention of the publick. It is well known that the fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries of Europe, and of England in particular, are poured into the republican ſtates of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, to an extent that has affected the principles and the manners of the people; to an extent which has excited the wonder, and the contempt of diſcerning foreigners. This influx of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atlantick commodities, co-operating with the funding ſyſtem, has converted into miſers the men of buſineſs; and the idle gentry into faſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious triflers. Break at once theſe bonds, which like a felon's chains diſgrace our hands, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain our actions! Promote the culture of thoſe articles which are in demand in Europe; but bring not back returns which ſink or unnerve the character. Promote, at home, the proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of thoſe manufactures which render the country, in all ſufficient meaſure, independent of the aid of others; and in exchange for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce receive ſo much ſpecie, as coming in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of freedom, forms the beſt ſupport of your independence.</p>
               <p>We have juſt ſeen the Britiſh nation thrown into the utmoſt conſternation, and threatened
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:031803_0038_0FEE745053C6DDC0"/>with preſent ruin, by the abſence of thoſe cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomary ſupplies of ſpecie, which have been exhauſted by a war. And does any man doubt that Britain, ſo long as the 14th and 15th arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the treaty remain, will perpetually inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date us with good, firſt to enrich herſelf; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly to keep the balance of trade againſt us, or ſo little in our favor as to drain us of the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent coin. Trade, in its preſent vaſt extent, is injurious in the extreme, more particularly as it is conducted with Britain; which perhaps has more the advantage of us, in the conveniencies ariſing from the balance of trade, than all the powers of Europe taken together: and were ſuch duties laid upon the commodities of the whole, as would anſwer the purpoſes we ſpeak of, the meaſure would probably be miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the people, and be conſidered as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable burden, and enormous grievance. By unreſtrained commerce, we know that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt maſs of wealth may be accumulated; but ſpecie is the moſt uſeful wealth, next to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries of life, and is even requiſite to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of thoſe neceſſaries. Great manufacturing countries, with great reſources in ſpecie, have nevertheleſs rendered their manufactures extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beneficial to them, as the means of prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the exportation of ſpecie in great foreign wars. A war has coſt Great Britain ſeveral times the amount of its whole circulating ſpecie; yet this money did not go out and return in large ſums; the circulating ſpecie, therefore, could not be the ſupport of the war; but manufactures, and bills purchaſed therewith. (Adam Smith, b. 4, chap. 1.) What then would be our reſources,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:031803_0039_0FEE7451DB67CEE0"/>not only in a foreign war, but a war of defence, ſince we have neither ſpecie nor manufactures, and who, it is admitted, ought not, with ſuch tracts of uncultivated land, to carry manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to a great extent, except in thoſe inſtances wherein facilities are formed by machinery, which older ſtates reject, to give employment to their population. The Spartans, it is true, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended themſelves without the precious metals; but our plans of government and ſocial habits are of characters utterly diſtinct from theirs, which we know were eminently rigid, ſelf-deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and parſimonious. Since then circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are not likely to change in the preſent, or perhaps in any other ſtate of philoſophical im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, let us at leaſt not add to the evils of avarice the evils of paper money; more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally becauſe theſe laſt do, in a very obſervable manner, conduce to the propagation of the firſt. Beſides the Spartans were ſometimes reduced to the neceſſity of borrowing ſpecie from monarchs, a meaſure greatly to be deprecated, for reaſons which will be ſuggeſted by what has gone before.</p>
               <p>There is a great error in ſuppoſing that wealth ought to be the firſt conſideration in the plans of every government; and yet this error ſeems to prevail in a moſt pernicious degree. When wealth is the firſt conſideration, liberty is not allowed to be the ſecond; for wealth engroſſes the whole man. Thus has fallen the democracy of England. So when different ſpecies of wealth preſent themſelves to our election,—that which upholds the freedom of the government—and that which enriches and enfeebles it—let us not heſitate to prefer the firſt.</p>

Adam Smith complains, that money <hi>only</hi> is apt to be conſidered as wealth. Whatever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial arrangements have been made upon this principle, were undoubtedly wrong; for money, correctly ſpeaking, is but the current repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative of wealth, and is of no uſe without it. But whatever was intended to encourage ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation, and reſtrain importation, ſo far as might be neceſſary to the admiſſion of a circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating medium, in exchange for the products of the country, ſeems evidently to be right. The wealth which has been accumulated by the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh nation, under all the diſadvantages of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry profligate, and moſt laviſh government, ſhews ſufficiently the wiſdom of their commercial ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangements; the two principal of which Mr. Smith admits, have been encouragements to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation, and reſtraints upon importation. Theories it is to be apprehended, unleſs ſelf evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, or enforced by reaſonings of mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal certainty, ought ever to be rejected in favor of experience. Whatever miſtakes Britain may have made about the relative value of ſpecie, it is evident that her maxims and purſuits have at different times introduced immenſe treaſures into her government. That theſe treaſures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main no more, is a diſgrace which is not to be imputed to her commercial arrangements, but to two other cauſes, well worth the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a younger ſtate; the one is, the unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallelled profuſion of licentious rulers; the other, that paper ſyſtem of finance, which our miniſters have had the audacity to adopt, which has already ſapped the baſis of liberty, and will ever poiſon the ſtreams of publick opulence:
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:031803_0041_0FEE7459C168C378"/>that ſyſtem of wickedneſs and ruin, which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the uſe of ſpecie can baniſh from our land. A rich country, without ſecure money, is in the ſame condition with a rich merchant, who has no monied capital; and even the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the country, however great (as will ſhortly be proved in England) is no convenient ſubject of taxation.</p>
               <p>Certain goods however, as thoſe of India, though purchaſed with ſpecie, might, agreeably to the reaſonings of Adam Smith, ſet on foot a trade, which would conduce to the vigor of a government. The goods ſo purchaſed, being ſold in a foreign-market, might have brought more than was given for them, and a ſurplus of caſh might have returned to America. The Britiſh miniſter however, perhaps foreſeeing this advantage, purſued the wonted policy of Britain, and poorly ſtipulated, in article 13, of the treaty, that all goods brought from Britiſh ports in India, ſhould be landed in no place but America, after which there ſhould be regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions adopted by both parties. Now ſhould it even be agreed upon by Britain, that ſuch ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles ſhall be re-ſhipped, it is evident that the expence would be a great objection: ſo that the money which goes to India, is likely to remain there by virtue of the treaty.</p>
               <p>In B. 4, Chap. 1. Smith aſſerts that "the quantity of every commodity, which human induſtry can either purchaſe or produce, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally regulates itſelf in every country according to the effectual demand, or according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of thoſe who are willing to pay the whole
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:031803_0042_0FEE745B47953D08"/>rent, labour, and profit, which muſt be paid, in order to prepare and bring it to market."</p>
               <p>Here he ſeems to overlook this circumſtance; that a country may have occaſion for a commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, and yet not poſſeſs the means of effectual demand, and this too, not by reaſon of its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural want of means "to pay the whole rent, labour, and profit, which muſt be paid in order to prepare and bring it to market," but by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of its reſources being ſwallowed up by the purchaſe of other commodities. Upon the ſame principle he ſeems to be wrong, when he ſays (b. 4, chap. 1) "No complaint is more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon than that of a ſcarcity of money. Money, like wine, muſt always be ſcarce with thoſe who have neither wherewithal to buy, nor credit to borrow it. Thoſe who have either, will ſeldom be in want, either of the money, or of the wine they have occaſion for." This, as well as what went before, he adduces to prove, that no care need be taken to provide a country with ſpecie. <hi>Money, like wine,</hi> will not only <hi>be ſcarce with thoſe who have neither wherewithal to buy, nor credit to borrow it;</hi> but it will alſo be ſcarce with thoſe who direct the whole of their reſour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces into other channels. In ſome of the ſtates of America, wine, and other articles of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, are abundant; becauſe the produce of the ſoil is given in exchange for them: if, on the contrary, the produce of the ſoil were given for money only, wine and other imports muſt, of courſe, be as ſcarce as ſpecie is at preſent.</p>
               <p>Smith ſays, moreover, (b. 1, chap. 9, part 3) "Gold and ſilver, like other commodities, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſeek the market where the beſt price is
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:031803_0043_0FEE745CCF518A10"/>given for them, and the beſt price is commonly given for every thing in the country which can beſt afford it."</p>
               <p>But in South-Carolina, before the revolution, a great price was given for ſpecie: 100 weight of rice for ſeven ſhillings; yet were not gold and ſilver very abundant. To what could this be owing, but the exceſs of the imports above the exports, and the productions of the country be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paid for, not in ſpecie, but in the manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Europe? A country may indeed grow richer, as has happened to America, though its imports every year exceed its exports. This year it may export £. 500,000, and import £. 550,000; the next year it may export £. 550,000, and import £. 600,000, it has therefore advanced £. 50,000 in its productions, and its capital has become greater in proportion to this advancement. This acceſſion of wealth may happen either by the importation of labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, the propagation thereof, or improvements in agriculture and manufactures, &amp;c. at home. Yet, under theſe circumſtances, may a country feel moſt ſenſibly the want of current coin.</p>
               <p>Smith obſerves, that the trade of a nation ought not neceſſarily to be diſcouraged, merely becauſe the balance is in its favor, it is only to be done in the aggregate. If by this it is meant, that the general average balance, all nations conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, is to be retained in our favor, let it be repeated that Britain almoſt monopolizes the trade of America; conſequently, care ought to be taken by us, to keep in our own hands the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of trade againſt that particular nation,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:031803_0044_0FEE746398079898"/>which, as was ſaid above, holds more of it than perhaps all other nations taken together.</p>
               <p>As to the extent to which encouragement ſhould be given to the importation of ſpecie; and the proſperity of manufactures (both as the means of excluding thoſe from abroad which prevent the influx of ſpecie in peace, and as the means of rendering us independent of foreigners in time of war) if the principle were admitted, the regulations would follow of courſe.</p>
               <p>This chapter ſhall be cloſed with this remark; that could a paper currency be ever ſo well ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, even in time of war (which is impoſſible) this evil will ever attend at in time of peace; the expenſive plans of policy, to which it never fails to lead, accumulate a mountain of publick debt; and this debt paralyſes government, and confirms abuſes, by the dread which is excited in monied men, the nation's creditors, leſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation ſhould ſhake the intereſts of the funds. This principle has ſupported the war againſt France; and prevented hitherto a reform in the parliamentary repreſentation of Great Britain.</p>

               <p>IN the foregoing diſcuſſions, I have omitted much matter, which I originally intended to bring againſt the treaty with Britain. I feared to fatigue the attention with what I believed to be unneceſſary, and indiſpoſe it to the conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of topicks which I believed to be neceſſary in the extreme.</p>
               <p>There are two main points, however, upon
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:031803_0045_0FEE74651ED8F900"/>which ſome of the promoters of the treaty attempt to ground their defence, and I ſhall remark upon them in few words.</p>
               <p>They ſay we firſt violated the treaty of peace; and that the Britiſh, in the act of taking away American property, during the war, did not violate it. The violations, on our part, were extremely unimportant in their conſequences, and were evidently converted into a pretext for embarraſſing us in a variety of particulars; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt, in the detention of the weſtern poſts. It was well known that their predatory conduct upon the ſeas, was more than a balance for our imputed infractions. The real motive of the detention of the weſtern poſts, was the power of involving us in an Indian war; and this power the Britiſh employed, as they ever do their miſchiefs, with moſt wicked ſpeed. Yet do the Britiſh faction, in America, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the reſt of their principles, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, preſume to advocate the perfidy of carrying off American property. Let us exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the article: "All hoſtilities, both by ſea and land, ſhall from henceforth ceaſe: all pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, on both ſides, ſhall be ſet at liberty; and his Britannick majeſty ſhall, with all convenient ſpeed, and without cauſing any deſtruction, or carrying away any negroes, or other property, of the American inhabitants, withdraw all his armies, garriſons and fleets from the ſaid United States, and from every port, place, or harbour, within the ſame." All hoſtilities between A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica and Britain we ſee were to ceaſe; if then, in future, any American property ſhould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, it would be a matter of courſe that it ſhould
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:031803_0046_0FEE7466A64EE668"/>be delivered up; what need then for any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion that it ſhould be done? and what the purpoſe of the ſtipulation for "cauſing no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and carrying away no negroes, or other property, of the American inhabitants?" Surely the purpoſe was to prevent the removal of what was actually in the hands of the Britiſh, and which we are told by Vattel, had become the property of the ſovereign: What was not in their power could not be carried away, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a violation of the agreement, that "all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilities ſhould ceaſe:" and in conformity to this additional ſtipulation, with regard to private property, we find a ſimilar one relative to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick property alſo. "It is agreed, that the Britiſh ſhall leave in all fortifications, the artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery that may be therein, and moreover they ſhall cauſe, or order, all archives, records, deeds, and papers, belonging to any of the ſaid ſtates, or their citizens, which, in the courſe of the war, may have fallen into the hands of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, to be forthwith reſtored and delivered to the proper ſtates, and perſons, to whom they belong—"If then the Britiſh violated the treaty, in this inſtance, it is evident, that, even ſuppoſing the interruption of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of Britiſh claims to have been an infrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the treaty, it was juſtifiable as an act of repriſal, and did not warrant the detention of the weſtern poſts, and other meaſures; attended as they were with advantages to the Britiſh ſo vaſt and diſproportionate, and to us, with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate loſſes in men and money; ſuſtained too in a cruel war with ſavages, fomented, as is now well known, by the mercileſs government of England.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="unknown:031803_0047_0FEE74682DBBA058"/>
Vattel (page 240) ſays, "When a caſe ariſes in which it would be too prejudicial to any one to take a law, or a promiſe, according to the rigour of the terms, a reſtrictive interpretation is alſo then uſed, and we except the caſe agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to the intention of the legiſlature, or of him who made the promiſe. For the legiſlature only requires what is juſt and equitable, and in the contract no one can engage, in favor of another, in ſuch a manner as to be eſſentially wanting to himſelf. It is therefore to be preſumed, that neither the legiſlature, nor the contracting pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, have intended to extend their regulations to caſes of this nature, and that they, themſelves, would have excepted them, had theſe caſes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented themſelves."</p>
               <p>Now, in the two moſt important caſes urged againſt us, as infractions of the treaty, namely the laws of Virginia and South-Carolina, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the recovery of Britiſh claims, the moſt ruinous conſequences muſt have enſued upon the operation of ſuch ſuits. It is a matter of noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, that when the reſtraints upon the courts of law were removed, the Britiſh creditors, while they ſpared the eſtates of their own fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, tore to pieces, without heſitation, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe, all thoſe which belonged to the friends of America: and the buſineſs of iſſuing writs, brought into lucrative practice, the moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure in the profeſſion of the law: and, for want of purchaſers, ſo cheaply would property have ſold, at the firſt paſſing of the inſtalment law in South-Carolina, that, even the Britiſh creditors themſelves would have ſuffered exceedingly, had they immediately enforced their claims.
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:031803_0048_0FEE746C28E7C188"/>But who can hear with patience the defence of Britiſh infractions, in conſequence of trifles im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to ourſelves, which affected but a ſmall proportion of Britiſh ſubjects, when the whole body of American ſeamen, in violation of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry principle of morals and humanity, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the rights, and honour of America, had perpetually been ſeized like beaſts, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards made to fight againſt friends, or brethren. When too no compenſation, or future ſecurity, was inſiſted on by the American negociators. We are told by Camillus, that American ſeamen ſpoke the language of Engliſhmen, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not be diſtinguiſhed from ſuch. Does Camillus believe, the Britiſh government would ſubmit to a plea thus ruinous to their trade, and naval ſtrength, and degrading to their honour, were we to attempt to preſs their ſeamen?</p>
               <p>It is to be obſerved, moreover, that moſt of the infractions complained of, took place from the disjointed, unorganized ſtate of the old fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral government. Let any candid, ſenſible man, judge, whether any power ought to be treated with in a ſecond inſtance, which, in the firſt, acting as in deriſion of all maxims of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and the laws of nations, had taken advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of over-ſights, and unavoidable circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Thus, becauſe, in a pacifick diſpoſition, we had ſtipulated more than we found ourſelves able to perform, and becauſe we did not ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately perform what was not in the power of the general government, this friendly ſtate of Britain is juſtified in all its acts of infidelity, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate treachery, oppreſſion, and robbery: all of which were trebly advantageous to itſelf, as
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:031803_0049_0FEE7470256FB998"/>they were moreover eminently pernicious to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to that people who firſt enabled us to take our rank among the nations of the earth.</p>
               <p>This then is the ally with which we have connected ourſelves, to the great diſguſt of long known, faithful friends. In our tranſactions with the Britiſh, I have obſerved above, that we have repeatedly felt the advantage of acts of alienati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Engliſh government, and never ſurely was there a time when ſuch acts more powerfully preſſed themſelves upon our adoption. Never, too, were we in a condition which ſo fully could eſtabliſh the prudence of ſuch mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. America, in her former attempts to rid herſelf of Britiſh influence, was in the ſituation of a man who ſtrives to amaſs wealth without a capital to work with. The ſucceſs, in both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, muſt be the reſult of great internal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources. The natural and political advantages of America, however, have increaſed exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſince the declaration of independence. Her wealth is perhaps doubled, and her popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more than doubled. Who ſhall tell the force, collected into maſs, which the combining republicks of America, France, and Holland, if it ſhould be found neceſſary to combine, ſhall hurl againſt the drooping head of Britain? Who ſhall calculate the exploits of three republicks, each of which has triumphed in its turn in the cauſe of freedom, and one of which has brought to utter ruin the nobleſt armies of Europe, and overrun the continent? Will any man ſet bounds to the potency of three free nations of armies, linked together for the purpoſe of breaking the bending pride of Britain? With what unequal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:031803_0050_0FEE7471AC04C898"/>might will this triple giant daſh vengeance upon a ſinking foe? Where ſhall Britain, with an exhauſted treaſury, ruined, divided councils, and empoveriſhed rebellious ſubjects, find means, once more, to hurl around the thunders of the deep? Who ſhall calculate the reſources and achievements of population, ſoil, and climate, ſo various and ſo vaſt, all acting in concert for the greateſt of purpoſes, under the immediate guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and the animating ſhouts of enthuſiaſtick liberty? All the proud advantages of commerce, wealth, naval power, and conqueſt, which ſo long marked Britain as the champion of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, whence came they, but from the liberal hand of freedom? Shall America, who in her infancy ſhrunk not from the uplifted arm of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in her fulleſt might, now decline the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt in her puberty; and dare not, with power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful aſſociates in the fight, to brave a feeble, aged, warrior, and ſend with ignominy, and ſorrow, to the grave, thoſe hairs which have grown grey in wickedneſs and ſtrife? What is the very pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of this Britiſh treaty? Is it not to break the energy of a republick, which the decaying ſtrength of Britain dreads? So, when Charles IId of England was a helpleſs wanderer, the monarchy of France reſtored him to his throne, to cripple the growing might of the republick which they feared. What are the miſcreant principles which bind us to this fallen bully, Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain? Fear and diſaffection. But let the cool, deliberate republican remember, that Britain cannot hurt him now; and that ſhe will never do him good. The experience which we our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and the French nation, have had of the
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:031803_0051_0FEE74746F79DAB8"/>Britiſh government, both hated for our love of liberty, warrant the concluſion, that, upon all occaſions which ſhall preſent themſelves, it will not fail to conſult its intereſts, indulging to the utmoſt its luſt of domination. England is not ſimply unfriendly to us in a negative ſenſe; it is poſitively and warmly inimical, as a haughty faſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious deſpotiſm: and France was, before the treaty, and may be made again, poſitively and warmly our unfeigned friend. The Britiſh have often ſhed our blood; the French have often ſhed their own in our defence. We have tried too long the friendſhip of the Britiſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but let us now, at length, once more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince this proud intruder, that it has deemed falſely of that ſpirit it once knew to dread, and that, like a little wanton boy, it has raſhly wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked a ſleeping lion.</p>

               <p>BUT let us endeavour to improve our judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the queſtion, whether the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion which has been formed between America and Britain, by the treaty, is likely to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with advantage to the republick. One mean of effecting our purpoſe, will be by exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining into the characters of thoſe men in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, who, during the late adminiſtration, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by unexampled pertinacity in every art of flattery and arrogance, meanneſs and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in procuring the execution of this treaty of amity and commerce.</p>

They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled the thoughtleſs multitude, by babbling idle tales about the needful energy of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; And in what at length have their perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious errors and deſigns terminated? In what but the energy of ruſhing into the gulph of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery and infamy? in ſubmiſſion to long, repeated, unprovoked injuries of the paſt, and a free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, on our part, in our treaty of redreſs, to ſubmit to more, or greater, which may be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in future? After triumphing over the arms of Britain, theſe ſorry ſtateſmen have degraded us like a conquered country. America is the Carthage of the preſent hour, which has lately paſſed beneath the yoke of Britain. To bring about theſe flagitious purpoſes, theſe daring ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fians have not heſitated to ſhake to the very baſis the fabrick of the federal union; while they accuſed the republicans of diſorganizing the government, they encouraged a mob to defy the immediate repreſentatives of the general maſs of the people in the federal houſe of repreſentatives, by whom, amidſt menaces and every ſpecies of outrage, the treaty was finally and reluctantly carried into execution. The gigantick form of America was found in ſlumber by the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

Now can any man who reflects upon the labours of the revolution, more eſpecially if he can ſay <hi>Quorum pars minima fui;</hi> can ſuch a man, without a ſtoick's apathy, forbear to rage at the view of ſchemes, which avarice or ambition, or the pernicious pride of ſelfiſh ariſtocracy has deviſed to make ſuch la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours fruitleſs?</p>
               <p>After all, bad as this treaty muſt be admitted to be, can we but ſucceed in ridding ourſelves of ſo great a bane, this eventual good will at laſt have attended its adoption; it has had an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence in pointing the eyes of the people, with ſome degree of attention, to the meaſures of their rulers. We ſhould know therefore, under that circumſtance, that waſps having uſed their ſtings have parted with them, that thoſe ſerpents which have injected their poiſon can deſtroy no more. Yet, after ſins, which the tongues of angels cannot tell; after crimes, which the fiends who prompted cannot recount, theſe men, who in their cells of midnight darkneſs, have undone their country, have the matchleſs effrontery to come forth in the glare of day, and to avow their guilt. The face of conſummate profligacy, formed of no penetrable ſtuff, has given to theſe men the ſacred privilege of innocence, <hi>nulla palleſcere culpa.</hi> Since then, this abandoned crew are ſo little aſhamed of ignominy, let us proceed to look into thoſe previous ſteps by which they ſtrove to alienate the minds of the citizens from thoſe principles which might fruſtrate the
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:031803_0054_0FEE747CE919BE68"/>execution of their deſigns upon the freedom, and upon the very exiſtence of the republick.</p>
               <p>One of the earlieſt artifices, by which it was attempted to ſtrip the nation of its rights, was, an attack upon the liberty of ſpeech, and of the preſs. The men who were aſſociated for the purpoſe of watching over the movements of our rulers, and expreſſing their opinions to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, were induſtriouſly repreſented as the very peſts of the community. The printers of free diſcuſſions upon public meaſures, were treated with ſcorn and abhorrence; and a halter, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed in a box, has been ſent to one of them, to intimidate the whole fraternity. In future, it is to be hoped, that both writers and printers, by the freedom of their animadverſions, will ſhew the decadence of all ſuch pernicious influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and that they will unite in an active uſe of a privilege, which it has been attempted to wreſt from their hands; a privilege, which while it remains, will be the palladium of the reſt, and gives us good hope, that the ſpoilers, who ſtrove to graſp it, may be forced, in their own deſpight, to quit in diſmay thoſe poſts they have held ſo long in infamy. But for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the freedom of the preſs, we might again have been told, we muſt not
<q>"Prate of ſtate affairs;"</q> But let us in our turn, acquaint theſe puny lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, that the rulers of a republican nation, can obtain the obedience of the citizens, by no means ſo certain as the exerciſe of republican maxims; without which they deſerve not to be obeyed; let us tell them that the moſt artful, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh demagogue, will ever find it hard to ſhake
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:031803_0055_0FEE747E6FAED538"/>an adminiſtration, in a repreſentative republick, ſo long as it performs its duties. Virtue, ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to publick officers in bad governments, in ſuch as are good is celeſtial panoply. Let not the violators of the publick rights expect forever to eſcape impunity, notwithſtanding the lenity they have undeſervedly experienced, during the late adminiſtration. And what was the return the people found for their moderation to the promoters of the ſhameful and illegal treaty? Was not every man, who diſliked this treaty, nay, were not the ſages and heroes of the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whoſe hoary hairs were twined with ivy, or with laurel; were not this veteran band of patriots branded with every mark of contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and diſgrace, by the moſt nefarious faction that ever inſulted the ſacred ears of virtue—a faction which are now ſtriving to bring theſe vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſeniors into their deſigns againſt the French: But ſhall theſe faithful ſervants of our country's cauſe, forget that they were ſtigmatized as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers, antifederaliſts, jacobins and diſorgani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers? Deceivers they were called, becauſe they ſtrove to undeceive; antifederaliſts, becauſe they ſtrove to preſerve the conſtitution and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of the federal government; jacobins, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they wiſhed to avert the miſeries of civil war, and mutual ſlaughter, which even now this treaty threatens, nay has already commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in a brother's blood; diſorganizers, becauſe they wiſhed to keep in ſound condition the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of the nation's liberty. When men, whoſe heads had whitened with the cares of government, and the toils of war—whoſe hearts remained ſtill ſpotleſs and unſophiſticated with
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:031803_0056_0FEE7482760CC2F0"/>the foppery of courts, the corruptions of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, or the fever of ambition; when ſuch citizens as theſe, are cenſured as the deluders of the people, to whom, beſide, ſhall we apply for counſel and conſolation? Shall we look to thoſe upſtarts, who have amaſſed ineſtimable treaſures by the ſale of honor? Shall we look to men who but yeſterday were the deadly foes to the champions of aſſaulted freedom? Shall we look to that government, which through ten long years of toil, and woe, and carnage, laboured to enſlave whom they had not murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Shall we link in fond embrace, our hands with hands of fell aſſaſſins, clotted with the blood of brethren, who died for our ſalvation? Or with the hands of ſelfiſh daſtard ſlaves, who ſet them on? Or with the hands of a furious, unrelenting, conſuming tyrant, who pointed them to their taſk of death, and at whom even folly looks with deriſion, and guilt with horror? Oh, call to your remembrance thoſe who freed you from that dependence on a deſpot, which this treaty would renew! They were ſimple, ſenſible, incorruptible men: men, who if they were poor, ſtill continued poor, that they might not be wicked: men, who were the firm, and I hope, in general immutable friends to that nation, which with ingratitude, commenſurate with congenial baſeneſs, the treaty invited us to abandon: to abandon too for <hi>diſtreſſes</hi> which happily they felt not. Who ſhall confide in ſuch foul flagitious counſellors? Who ſhall again ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter to our aid, under circumſtances of ſuch complicated guilt and folly? England is perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and France is wiſe: the firſt, if ſhe has
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:031803_0057_0FEE74868D5BE818"/>power, will oppreſs us, becauſe ſhe knows the laſt will ſport with our well deſerved calamity, and ſcorn all commerce with the baſe: thus ſhall we be even ſtript of the ſacred dignity of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune.</p>
               <p>Among the topicks of calumny employed by the adminiſtration, it has been aſſerted, that their enemies have wiſhed them removed from ſelfiſh or ambitious views, and that the treaty was made the pretext. Selfiſh and ambitious men there doubtleſs will be found in every oppoſition: the reaſoning of theſe however deſerve to be heard, and if, upon a ſcrutiny, the argument be acknowledged to be good, and the character worthleſs, accept the advice, and let the advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer be rejected; for it muſt be admitted by all parties, that a bad man will make a worſe officer. As to the adminiſtration, and the promoters of the treaty, every man who loves the principles of republican government, which, as far as in them lies they have deſtroyed, cannot chooſe but wiſh them out. But how miſerably negligent, or ignorant of their intereſts, muſt that nation be, whom nothing but this damning inſtrument can rouſe? How deep that ſleep whence burſting thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders only can awake?</p>
               <p>It is ſaid too, that the republicans are unfriendly to the treaty, becauſe enemies to the Britiſh. If by the Britiſh is meant the Britiſh nation, the charge is falſe; were Britons republicans we could freely make them brethren; but in being enemies to the Britiſh government, we are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to perfidy, which regards no treaties; to ambition, which graſps at the dominion of our country; to tyranny, which delights in cruelty.
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:031803_0058_0FEE748814B8DAF8"/>Could we, with any prudence, put confidence in a ſtate, which at the very moment it was fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming a treaty of amity with one free people, was engaged in the abominable attempt to deprive another of its freedom, or its being?</p>

               <p>THAT the arrogance, meanneſs, duplicity, and baſeneſs of our rulers ſhould have been ſuch as we have found them, ought not to be a ſubject of ſurpriſe, ſince theſe men have not ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled, ſome to profeſs, others to prove, themſelves votaries to monarchy, which bears theſe igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous ſymbols on its front. Nor need we mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, that thoſe who vilely truckle to a prince's nod, ſhould ſeek their graceleſs retribution in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's wrongs. A patient ſlave proves an unfeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tyrant; ſo pride and meanneſs ſtrut or creep by turns, and mark the Proteus form or ſelfiſh deſpotiſm. Such men as were employed in the fabrication of the Britiſh treaty were, if not morally, at leaſt politically, diſqualified for the taſk of forming an alliance for the proſperity of a republick. Nor is it to be wondered at, that ſuch men have toiled, with waſteful hands, to bring to wreck all principles of freedom, which had but yeſterday been launched upon the ſea of politicks. In the unhallowed ſtrife no means were left untried; neither the guile of Satan, the fallacies of Belial, nor the rage of Moloch. This treaty, which holds up an olive branch to our eyes, veils a ſcourge of ſcorpions for our backs, and, like a wily Dalilah, will yield us,
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:031803_0059_0FEE748ADFB4BAD0"/>ſunk in ſoft langours, ſhorn of ſtrength, into the unſparing hands of Britain. Oh let us not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the bleſſings we poſſeſs, but graſp them now, as with the convulſive pangs of dying liberty! The American government, as it lingers now, is founded upon a full, and free, and equal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation, in every branch of legiſlation, of the whole body of the people which gave it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the firſt government, of this ſpecies, which the world could boaſt, and the only ſpecies of free government which gives, or could give, a credible proſpect of duration. Too long did monarchies affright the ſhuddering world with deeds of horror, in ever-during conflicts for the powers of miſchief. Never will mankind be freed from wo and ſlaughter, till republicks ſhall bear down the ſcale of power, and keep all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors in awe. Then, and not till then, ſhall we ſee the Saturnian reign of order, peace, and juſtice. Nor does the warlike character of France invalidate this doctrine at all. France fights in her defence, and does but drive back into the countries of her enemies thoſe wars which would conſume her own. But when the work of liberty ſhall be complete, free republicans will direct their eyes to more inviting ſcenes, nor will appoint ſuch rulers as will with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw them from repoſe. In monarchies, on the contrary, the ſubject is conſtrained to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent himſelf, as he can, with the wretch who rules, whether a coward, who deſerts him in the day of peril, or a conqueror, who impels him to the field of blood. Let us render our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves dear to thoſe nations which have ſtriven with us the fight of freedom; let us love, and we
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:031803_0060_0FEE7490537619F8"/>ſhall be loved again by that aſtoniſhing nation, whoſe enthuſiaſm is upheld by their magnanimity, whoſe magnanimity by their vigour, whoſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour hurls them like thunderbolts upon their foes. This is the character of the French re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick; while feeble Britain, like a broken reed, ſhall ſink beneath your weight, or pierce your ſide. Her weakneſs only can reſtore her innocence; a frozen ſerpent, or a toothleſs ſavage.</p>
               <p>What difficulties may be thrown in the way of conciliation with France, by the treaty ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the ſenate, it is impoſſible to foreſee: but let thoſe apoſtates to the faith of freedom remember the fate of delinquents in the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution congreſs. Let ſuch recreants to good be warned by the fall of Bolinbroke, or ſtrive too late, in vain, to cool the fever of ambition, with the unpalatable cup of cold philoſophy,</p>
               <p>Even theſe men, if they love themſelves— if they wiſh to be remembered without execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when grey hairs ſhall give them warning to quit the ſtage of public life—if they wiſh to eſcape that bed of thorns, which goads the faithleſs ruler, ſhould uſe their utmoſt efforts to redeem their country.</p>
               <p>As to thoſe members of the houſe of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives, from whom the preſſure of the time extorted reluctant co-operation, let them feel no repugnance againſt the meaſure of countervail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miſchief; more eſpecially miſchief which themſelves have done. The publick confidence muſt be reſumed by confeſſion and renunciation, not by pertinacity in error.</p>
               <p>For the preſident of the United States, he has held up a beacon, by which each mariner,
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:031803_0061_0FEE30B461F2FE88"/>in our turbulent ſea, may ſteer his courſe. He came into office at a criſis, and in a ſituation. more than any to be coveted. He found an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of things, and a body of courtiers, the very worſt a free repreſentative government could ever dread to know. This order of things, and this body of courtiers, he has reſolved to fix. His country looked up to him for wiſdom, for candour, for deciſion, for ſalvation, and what would have been the glory of that man, who ſhould have redeemed his country a ſecond time from ſlavery and perdition.</p>
               <p>How widely this giddy ruler has wandered from the path of rectitude, how madly he is in hoſtility with the principles of the republick which has employed him, we ſee with ſorrow; but we ſee it not with wonder, ſince he is the work of Britiſh hands. All that has been left undone, by others, to effect our ruin, he has ſtriven to complete. Of the country, over which, in an evil hour, he was called to preſide, he ſpeaks with exultation for her proſperity, when ſome angel's hand ſhould be employed to ſnatch her from deſpair. He ſpeaks of peace, and while his breath is ſtill warm with the word, it is employed again to ſound the charge to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. Can we admit the ſincerity of ſuch a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate? If we acquit his heart we muſt deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe his head; if we acquit his head we muſt abominate his heart. As to his wretched gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conade, upon the ſubject of American arms (to ſay nothing of the ſilence which his party obſerved upon the inſolence of Britain) let me add to what has gone before, that the peaſants of the northern ſtates, who alone can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:031803_0062_0FEE74949EE2E410"/>upon for their ſtrength, would ſoon be deprived, by their allies the Britiſh, of all ſelf reſpect, and even that independence which muſt give efficiency to ſtrength; and for the marine of America, a naval war would be a mine of gold to the French nation, while we ſhould not reap the advantages even of a mine of lead. The means by which alone we can hope to graſp our object, is by holding up the greateſt good to friendly nations; the treaty, on the contrary, has rewarded aggreſſion; and not only the French, but the Dutch alſo, and perhaps every other nation, make the ſame complaint. The miniſter at the Hague, indeed, tells you, the Dutch complain, becauſe they are inſtructed ſo to do by France; but needs a man a prompter to diſcern his enemy? Had the French inſulted us as groſſly as has been declared, and found their policy in the policy of Britain, what, who, let me aſk, firſt ſpurned into the duſt this pride of ours, placing it under the feet of every wanton paſſenger to cruſh it down at pleaſure? What but the treaty with Britain? Who, but the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh faction in America? Yet does your preſident tell you we are not to throw ourſelves into ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſcale of European politicks. Has not the treaty done this now? Would not mr. Pitt ſmile with triumph, to hear the firſt magiſtrate of the United States boaſt of ſuch a neutrality? A neutrality, which if not an armed, is at leaſt a hoſtile neutrality. When the obnoxious articles of the treaty ſhall have been done away, when the articles which are at defiance, not only with France, but every power on earth, are done away, then, then indeed, will there be a neutrality in
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:031803_0063_0FEE749759977F98"/>fact and not in words, not in thin air, not in any nothing. Far different will be the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſuch a meaſure, from that of meaſures formed by men, who while they ſteered the bark of ſtate, were not poſſeſſed of ſkill to foreſee a ſtorm of ſlaughter, or a ſhower of blood; or watched like cloud-veiled fiends but to betray; and tempted to deſtroy!</p>
               <p>Hear further what you are told by this new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born monarch of a republick; and from his rant ſhould the character of America be too raſhly eſtimated, ſhe would be judged an infant of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely ſtature, which, in its mental weakneſs, believed itſelf a man.</p>
               <p>In remarking upon the ſpeech of the preſident of the directory to mr. Munroe, upon his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, he ſays, "the ſpeech of the preſident diſcloſes ſentiments more alarming than the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal of a miniſter, becauſe more dangerous to our independence and union; and, at the ſame time, ſtudiouſly marked with indignities towards the government of the United States. It evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces a diſpoſition to ſeparate the people from the government: to perſuade them that they have different affections, principles, and intereſts from thoſe of their fellow citizens, whom they, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, have choſen to manage their common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns; and thus to produce diviſions fatal to our peace. Such attempts ought to be repelled with a deciſion which ſhall convince France and the world, that we are not a divided people; hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliated under a colonial ſpirit of fear, and ſenſe of inferiority, fitted to be the miſerable inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of foreign influence, and regardleſs of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional honor, character, and intereſt."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="unknown:031803_0064_0FEE749A15A57D18"/>
This ſpeech of the preſident of the directory, it ſeems, was delivered in the warmth of his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to Mr. Munroe, as a <hi>republican.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it would have excited ſo much indignation in the feeling boſom of Mr. Adams, had it been delivered by the ſecretary of an European mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, to an ariſtocratick miniſter, expreſſing ſimilar diſapprobation of a republican adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration in America, I ſhall leave to the deciſion even of the ariſtocracy itſelf. But, ſo far as the ſpeech has a tendency to perſuade the people that "their rulers have different affections, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and intereſts, from thoſe of their fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citizens, whom they, themſelves, have choſen to manage their common concerns;" ſo far as this doctrine goes, no republican of common infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, whether in America or France, will find it poſſible to conceive even the embryo of a doubt: and no man who was not conſcious of the truth of this diſtinction of <hi>affections, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> and <hi>intereſts,</hi> would ſo warmly reſent the explanation. Mr. Adams could not but know, or he knows not enough to qualify him for a much inferior office to that which he has been called upon to diſgrace, that the purſuits of the governors, as diſcriminated from thoſe of the governed, have, in all ſtates, been the primal ſource of tyranny in the firſt, and vaſſaliage in the laſt. An endeavour, therefore, on the part of the preſident of the United States, to cloſe the eyes of the unwary multitude upon their concerns, and to perſuade them to reſign, with ſottiſh apathy, and infatuation, their deareſt rights and intereſts, into the unreſponſible hands of any ſet of rulers, much more into the hands of
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:031803_0065_0FEE749CDC957970"/>avowed enemies to republican government, is an act of treaſon againſt the majeſty of the American people. How far the French were wrong in declaring their belief of an exiſting difference between the ſentiments of the people, and the rulers of America, we will not determine, but ſimply remark, that if it did not exiſt, the promulgation of the opinion of the directory was not likely to originate this difference; and this we will add, (and who ſhall deny it?) that it was very fortunate the directory ſo long had <hi>one</hi> opinion of an adminiſtration which ſo little deſerved a good one, and <hi>another</hi> of a people which it was ſo much our intereſt they ſhould love. For the preſent adminiſtration, if they are wiſe, they will not delay to ſhew, not only to the French, but to all the world beſide, that they deſerve not to be ſtamped with any marks which ſhall diſtinguiſh them from their fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citizen; but that they are as good, and attends as aſſiduouſly to the intereſts of the republick as the nation itſelf, which they have the high honor to ſerve.</p>
               <p>Much ſtreſs is laid upon the deſire indicated by the French to cripple the commerce of Great Britain; and upon their attempt to get Engliſh veſſels excluded from the ports of Denmark, Hamburgh, and I know not what. It is inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated that they are ambitious, and are deſirous to build their greatneſs upon the ruin of Britain. That any nation ſhould ſtrive to build their greatneſs upon that foundation which alone can bear it, is ſurely no cuſtomary ſubject of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, in thoſe inſtances wherein it is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:031803_0066_0FEE749E640396D8"/>that any ſcruples have been obſervable in the proceedings of the party which is to ſuffer.</p>
               <p>Denmark, Hamburgh, America, and every maritime nation upon the globe, no doubt, are ambitious to obtain a portion of thoſe commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial advantages, which have ſo long rendered Britain the tyrant of the ſeas. While tyrants proſper, ſubjects muſt remain in poverty. Let them periſh all, whether upon the water, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the land! The ſtruggle is not between A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica and France; it is between kings and freemen. Our die will ſoon be thrown, and it is an awful caſt.</p>
