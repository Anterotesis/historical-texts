            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005956_0004_1026E1B891A814A0"/>
Men bear to an <hi>Enemy.</hi> Yet, this is a Caſe which too often happens, to make the greateſt Caution, with Reſpect to it, both in Miniſter and People, ſeem unneceſſary; and a Diſcourſe upon it at this Time unſeaſonable. An Example of it, for the Inſtruction and Warning of all, is recorded in the <hi>Paſſage</hi> now before us.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul,</hi> at his firſt coming among the <hi>Galatians,</hi> and preaching the Goſpel to them, was very highly eſteemed and loved by them. They received him as an <hi>Angel</hi> of GOD—as the LORD's Meſſenger to them; even as CHRIST JESUS, for whom he was an Ambaſſador, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting his Perſon, and acting in his Stead. They treated him with all proper Marks of extraordinary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect: accounted it, and often ſpake of it, as their ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Felicity, to have the Goſpel preached to them by ſo excellent, able, and faithful a Miniſter of it; and were ready to do, or part with, any Thing, for his Sake. Had it been <hi>poſſible</hi> to help him thereby, they <hi>would have pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out their own Eyes, and given them to him.</hi> But alas! they were ſoon removed, ſeparated in Affection <hi>from him, that called them into the Grace of</hi> CHRIST. Whereupon he thus expoſtulated with them, <hi>Where is then the Bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs that ye ſpake of?</hi> Is all your boaſted Happineſs in me, as your Apoſtle, now at an end? <hi>Am I therefore become your Enemy, becauſe I tell you the Truth?</hi> Am I indeed, as you take me to be, your Enemy, meaning you Miſchief, and hurting your Souls, becauſe I have preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſtill perſiſt to declare unto you the Truth?</p>
            <p>And if from ſuch an One as <hi>Paul,</hi> the warm Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Galatians</hi> were ſo alienated, it is the leſs to be wonder'd at, that there ſhould be in all Ages ſince, as we ſee in the preſent, many Inſtances of the like Nature; which may nevertheleſs lead us to inquire,</p>
            <p>Whence it is, or, how it comes to paſs, That the ardent Affections of People to their Miniſters
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005956_0005_102729EBAAA966E8"/>
are apt ſoon to cool; yea, oftentimes to be wholly alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from them?</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Through Infirmity of the Fleſh,</hi> Miniſters preach the Goſpel: And this may occaſion an Alienation of People's Affections from them. <hi>Ye know how through Infirmity of the Fleſh, I preached the Goſpel unto you at the firſt. And my Temptation which was in my Fleſh, ye deſpiſed not, nor rejected.</hi> At the firſt they did not, but afterwards (it ſeems) they did, take Offence at it, and deſpiſe, and reject him for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Infirmity of the Fleſh,</hi> may denote the Weakneſs of human Nature; the Imperfection that attended <hi>Paul,</hi> and is to be found in every one that preacheth the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in this frail and mortal State. 1 Cor. ii. 3. <hi>I was with you in Weakneſs.</hi> Notwithſtanding the high Station, and dignifying Character of the Miniſters of CHRIST, yet are they weak Creatures, as juſtly, if not by Way of Contempt, as vulgarly ſo termed. Though they are <hi>Angels</hi> by Office, yet do they not excel in Strength like thoſe which are ſo by Nature: But are Men of like Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions with others — Compaſſed with <hi>Infirmity;</hi> as every <hi>High-Prieſt,</hi> taken from among Men, was, under the Law. God hath conſulted, not only his own Glory, but alſo the Peoples Advantage, in putting the Treaſure of the Goſpel into earthern Veſſels, and ſpeaking to them by Men, like themſelves, formed out of the Clay. Yet, for this natural <hi>Infirmity of the Fleſh,</hi> thro' which Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters preach, they are ſometimes deſpiſed and rejected. It proves a Temptation unto People, to think meanly of them, and an Occaſion of their Diſreſpect and Diſguſt at them. For they are apt to look for <hi>Angelical</hi> Perfection in their Miniſters, not willing to make them the common Allowances, that are due to the Frailty of human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: and would have them be ſo ſpiritual, and live ſo by Faith, as not to care for the Things of this Life:
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:005956_0006_102729ED4066E3D8"/>
and to ſow unto them ſpiritual Things, and not reap their carnal Things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>By Infirmity of the Fleſh,</hi> the Apoſtle may intend ſome perſonal Imperfection, bodily Defect, or accidental Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, attending him. There is a Tradition, that <hi>Paul</hi> (according to the Signification of his Name) was a little Man of low Stature: that his Body was crooked, his Voice ſmall, and not very pleaſant. And for ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity of the Fleſh, he might be unreaſonably deſpiſed by ſome. 2 Cor. x. 10. <hi>For his Letters (ſay they) are weighty and powerful, but his bodily Preſence is weak and his Speech contemptible.</hi> So weak in their Judgment are ſome People, as to withhold, or withdraw deſerved Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem and Affection from thoſe, who through any ſuch like unavoidable Infirmity of the Fleſh preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel unto them.</p>
            <p>But, the greateſt Infirmity of the Fleſh, which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> here hath Reference to, was his <hi>Affliction,</hi> the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution he ſuffered in preaching the Goſpel. This he often calleth by that Name. 2 Cor. xii. 9, 10. 'Moſt gladly therefore will I rather glory in my Infirmities, that the Power of CHRIST may reſt upon me. Therefore I take Pleaſure in Infirmities, in Reproaches, in Neceſſities, in Perſecutions, in Diſtreſſes for CHRIST'S Sake; for when I am weak, then am I ſtrong.' He ſpeaks in that Chapter of a <hi>Thorn in the Fleſh,</hi> ſharp Perſecution; which the Anſwer of GOD to his Prayer that it might depart from him, ſtiles <hi>Weakneſs.</hi> Ver. 7, 9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Infirmity of the Fleſh,</hi> the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in our Text calleth his <hi>Temptation</hi> which was in his <hi>Fleſh.</hi> It was a Trial of his Faith and Fidelity, and of People's ſincere Regard for him. At the firſt, the <hi>Galatians deſpiſed not, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected it,</hi> nor him for it; but afterwards they became prejudic'd againſt him, on Account of it: That Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution eſpecially, which he ſuffered from the Tongues
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005956_0007_102729EED0E47E50"/>
of <hi>falſe Teachers,</hi> had this bad Effect upon them. There were ſuch then as preached CHRIST of <hi>Envy</hi> and <hi>Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> ſuppoſing to add Affliction to St. <hi>Paul's Bonds;</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to vex and grieve his Spirit, to leſſen his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and Intereſt among the People, and diſcourage him in his Work. He ſpeaks of them in the Verſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my Text; <hi>They zealouſly affect you, but not well: they would exclude you.</hi>— You from the Liberty and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of the Goſpel, as well as me from the Dignity of Apoſtleſhip—<hi>that ye might affect them—them only.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Afflictions</hi> of Miniſters, which are their <hi>Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> in their Fleſh, Poverty, Sickneſs and Weakneſs of Body, ſome corporal Deficiency or Deformity, Contempt and Perſecution from the Men of the World; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, Reproaches from falſe Brethren, ill Uſage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong their <hi>Mother's Children,</hi> that are cauſeleſly angry with them, too often cool the warm Affections of their People towards them, and alienate their Minds from them.</p>
            <p>Moſt unjuſtly are Miniſters deſpiſed, and rejected, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch <hi>Infirmity of the Fleſh</hi> attends them in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel. The more worthy are they of Reſpect and Love on that Account: That ſuch Diſcouragement does not hinder their engaging and continuing in a Work of ſo great Difficulty and Danger. They give clearer Proof of their Love to Souls, and diſcover greater For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Spirit, by preaching the Goſpel through <hi>Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the Fleſh.</hi> It argues, to a Judgment of Charity, the Strength of Grace in their Souls, overcoming this <hi>Temptation</hi> which is in their Fleſh. <hi>Acts</hi> xx. 24. 'Bonds and Afflictions abide me. But none of thoſe Things move me, neither count I my Life dear unto my ſelf, ſo that I might finiſh my Courſe with Joy, and the Miniſtry which I have received of the LORD JESUS, to teſtify the Goſpel of the Grace of GOD.'</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:005956_0008_102729F0C7BEAE68"/>2. Miniſters are ſometimes look'd upon by People as their Enemies, for telling them the <hi>Truth. Am I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore become your Enemy, becauſe I tell you the Truth? Paul</hi>'s declaring the Truth of GOD ſo fully and plainly to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> made them count him their Enemy. He preached the true and only Goſpel of CHRIST unto them. <hi>I certify you, Brethren,</hi> ſaith he, Chap. i. Ver. 11. <hi>That the Goſpel which was preached of me, is not after Man, for I neither received of Man, neither was I taught it, but by the Revelation of</hi> JESUS CHRIST. So aſſured was he of the Divinity of his Doctrine, that he there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces a terrible <hi>Anathema</hi> againſt Man or Angel, that ſhould preach the contrary. <hi>Though we, or an Angel from Heaven, preach any other Goſpel unto you, than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accurſed. As we ſaid before, ſo ſay I now again, if any Man preach any other Goſpel unto you, than that ye have received, let him be accurſed.</hi> Awful Words indeed! to make every Preacher take heed to his Doctrine.</p>
            <p>The Truth which <hi>Paul</hi> hath ſpecial Reference to in the Text, is that of Chriſtians Freedom from the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude of the <hi>Moſaic Yoke,</hi> the Bondage of the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Law. He throughly underſtood, and boldly aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Chriſtian Liberty:</hi> And this was improv'd againſt him, as a popular Prejudice, among the Jewiſh Converts to Chriſtianity. Many of them were ſtill wedded to their old religious Service, and retain'd a fond Opinion of the Excellence and Unalterableneſs of the ritual Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. So bewitch'd were the fooliſh <hi>Galatians,</hi> as to be enamour'd with Bondage; ſo unreaſonable, as to count him their Enemy, who was their Advocate for Liberty.</p>
            <p>It is the great and indiſpenſible Duty of Miniſters, to tell People the <hi>Truth.</hi> They are appointed by CHRIST to teach it. This is the Work, to which they are ſet apart. And for the due Performance of which, they
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005956_0009_102729F2A09D1B18"/>
muſt have the <hi>Knowledge of the Truth;</hi> need be better acquainted with it, than thoſe unto whom they are to tell it. The <hi>Law of Truth</hi> ſhould be in their Mouth; and they always ſpeak forth the <hi>Words of Truth.</hi> GOD's Word is the Truth, which they are ſolemnly charged to preach. 2 Tim. iv. 2. <hi>Preach the Word</hi>—the Goſpel, the Word of Truth; that People may be taught as the Truth is in JESUS; rather than as it is in the Writings of any Men, how renowned ſoever for Orthodoxy, or admired for Learning. CHRIST is the Truth, which Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are to preach—the true Scripture-Doctrins con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his <hi>Perſon,</hi> and <hi>Offices,</hi> conſtituted and deſigned by infinite Wiſdom and Goodneſs for the Relief and Salvation of fallen, miſerable Men. In Conſequence of which gracious Diſpenſation, and to their being Partakers of the Benefit, Miniſters are to tell People the Neceſſity and Nature of <hi>Regeneration,</hi> which is <hi>Truth in the inward Parts;</hi> and of <hi>evangelical Obedience,</hi> — the Way of Truth, which muſt be known, and walked in by all, that through Grace would arrive to a happy and glorious Eſtate in Heaven.</p>
            <p>Miniſters are to tell People the whole Truth; though in rightly dividing the Word of Truth, they ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt moſt on thoſe Parts of it, which are of greateſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Concern to the Honour of GOD, and Intereſt of Souls—have the directeſt Influence on Men's Practice in this World, and their Happineſs in that which is to come.</p>
            <p>Miniſters ſhould tell People the Truth <hi>plainly;</hi> that by Manifeſtation of it, they may commend themſelves to every Man's Conſcience in the Sight of GOD. They ſhould ſpeak <hi>boldly</hi> in aſſerting and defending the Truth, and reproving of Sin, which is oppoſite to it. Jer. xxiii. 28. <hi>He that hath my Word, let him ſpeak my Word faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; what is the Chaff to the Wheat, ſaith the LORD?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:005956_0010_102729F91A1CB528"/>Miniſters are bound to tell People the Truth, in their public Diſcourſes, and private Applications to them, and by exemplary Walking before them in the Truth. The Diſcharge of their whole Office conſiſts in their telling People the Truth, in the various Ways which they are requir'd to do it, on Pain of being look'd upon, and dealt with by GOD, as the falſeſt of Men.</p>
            <p>But, for their Faithfulneſs therein, People ſometimes account and treat them as their Enemies. So did the <hi>Jews</hi> CHRIST. Joh. viii. 20. <hi>Now ye ſeek to kill me, a Man that hath told you the Truth, which I have heard of GOD.</hi> And ſo perſecuted they all the Prophets, and Apoſtles: And the beſt Miniſters, in all Ages of the Church, have been for this, in ſome Degree or other, hated and rejected. The Minds of proud and carnal Men are ſhut up, and barred with various Appetites, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and Paſſions, againſt the Truth, ſo that they do not admit it. They receive not the Love of the Truth, and therefore eſteem not them in Love, for their Work's Sake, who tell it them. The Truth which they cannot readily ſwallow, nor eaſily digeſt, occaſions ſour Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices in them againſt the Diſpenſers of it. If a Preacher by the Light of heavenly Truth, detects and reproves a wicked Man, he is provoked to ſay unto him as <hi>Ahab</hi> to <hi>Elijah, Haſt thou found me, O mine Enemy?</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Kings xxi. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>.</note> If he delivers any Thing contrary to the prejudicate Notions of a good Man, he alſo is apt to be offended, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject him as an Heretick.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Miniſters may be wanting in their <hi>affectionate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards</hi> for the People, and this may leſſen the People's for them. Would to GOD! that none had ever in this Way, given greater Cauſe of Diſſatisfaction, than the bleſſed Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> whom the fooliſh <hi>Galatians</hi> deem'd their Enemy, becauſe he told them the Truth. As
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005956_0011_102729FAAEF243C8"/>
Faithfulneſs, ſo Failure, in the miniſterial Work (that eminent Office of Love,) may ſometimes occaſion the Eſtrangement of Affections from them that are employ'd in it.</p>
            <p>There are none more deſpicable Creatures on Earth, more worthy to be rejected of GOD, and all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, than Men of corrupt Minds, and deſtitute of the Truth, and of Love to CHRIST and Souls, thruſting themſelves, by ſome Means or other, into the ſacred Office; and, under Pretence of extraordinary Zeal and Charity, ſo exerciſing it for a while, as to captivate the Affections of an injudicious Multitude, and betray them into Error, Sin, and Ruin. Iſai. ix. 15. <hi>The Prophet that teacheth Lies, he is the Tail.</hi> Hoſ. 4. 6. <hi>Becauſe thou haſt rejected Knowledge, I will alſo reject thee, that thou ſhalt be no Prieſt to me.</hi> Mal. ii. 8. 9. <hi>Ye are departed out of the Way, ye have cauſed many to ſtumble at the Law: ye have corrupted the Covenant of Levi, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts. Therefore have I alſo made you contemptible and baſe before all the People, according as ye have not kept my Ways, but have been partial in the Law.</hi> GOD hath his Time to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover falſe Teachers, and put them to Shame and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion. 'Of this Sort (ſays the <hi>Apostle</hi>) are they which creep into Houſes, and lead captive ſilly Women, laden with Sins, led away with diverſe Luſts: ever learning, and never able to come to the Knowledge of the Truth. Now as <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi> withſtood <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo do theſe alſo reſiſt the Truth: Men of corrupt Minds, Reprobates concerning the Faith. But they ſhall proceed no further: for their Folly ſhall be manifeſt unto all Men, as theirs alſo was. <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Tim. iii. 6, &amp;c.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But even ſuch as are true Friends to CHRIST and Souls, and who from a Principle of ſincere and ſervent Love, undertake to feed his Sheep and Lambs, their Affections
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005956_0012_102729FDE78F3280"/>
may be warmeſt toward their People, at their firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amongſt them. Through Infirmity of the Fleſh they may afterwards grow more dull in their Work, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs in their Care to pleaſe all Men for their Profit; and through Temptation fail more in the Performance of their Duty. Unto the Angel of the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> CHRIST ſaid, <hi>I have ſomewhat againſt thee, becauſe thou haſt left thy firſt Love.</hi> Rev. ii. 4. And as miniſterial Zeal abateth, the People's Love is apt to wax cold, when indeed the Fervour of it is moſt needed, and ſhould be uſed to re-inflame that Zeal. Col. iv. 17. <hi>Say to</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chippus, <hi>take heed to the Miniſtry, which thou haſt received in the LORD, that thou fulfil it.</hi> 'It is good (ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in the Context) to be zealouſly affected <hi>always</hi> in a good Thing.' It is good for a Miniſter to be ſo in the Execution of his Office to the End; that ſo he be not, in any Meaſure, the faulty Cauſe of their becoming coldly, or evil affected towards him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Through natural <hi>Inconſtancy</hi> of their Minds, People are ſubject to this Change of them, reſpecting their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters. Scarce any Thing is more mutable than the human Mind; nor any Particular, in which the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of it is oftner diſcover'd, than in People's Regard for their Miniſters; one Day, extolling; and the next, decrying of them, of which ſometimes no other ſo juſt Account can be given, as the natural Fickleneſs of Man; who is unſtable as Water: a reſtleſs Sort of Creature, that is given to Change. He is ſo in his Comforts: the very Delights of Nature by Continuance, grow tedious and burdenſome to him; and Pleaſures need to be ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved and refreſhed by other Pleaſures. He is very changeable in his Religion: One while ſhewing great Forwardneſs to embrace the Truth, and the Preachers of it; and anon falling away from it, and them; without any Reaſon of ſuch Defection. Gal. v. 7. <hi>Ye did run well, who did hinder you, that ye ſhould not obey the Truth?</hi> Joh. v. 35. <hi>He was a burning and ſhining Light: and
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005956_0013_10272A02019A4F10"/>
ye were willing for a Seaſon to rejoice in his Light.</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly pleaſed were the People with <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, when he began his Miniſtry among them. The Word expreſſing this, ſignifies, that they leaped for Joy— danced about him, as Children about a Bon-fire. But, like Children, they were not long pleaſed with him: rejoiced in his Light only for a Seaſon—for an Hour. He did burn and ſhine, in his Doctrine and Life, with equal Zeal and Luſtre; but they cooled in their Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons toward him, and ſoon loſt their Eſteem for one that was greater than a Prophet.</p>
            <p n="5">5. To the Want of due Care in <hi>placing</hi> the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on Miniſters, may frequently be owing the ſudden Alienation thereof from them. An Error in the firſt Step, betrays People into their After miſconduct and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, in Reſpect of their Miniſters. As when they are raſh and inconſiderate in the Choice of them. Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that run before the Underſtanding, and are not guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Judgment, are vagrant, and never well ſettled. If People's Eſteem for Miniſters, be not founded in the moſt ſolid and ſubſtantial Qualifications of ſuch; if it be raiſed on no firmer Ground, than ſome little Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments, external Embelliſhments, and thoſe ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Ornaments, which ſet off a Preacher, and with which weak Minds are apt to be much taken at firſt, it is not likely to continue. Affections which are excited, and drawn forth by thoſe Things which commend Miniſters to the Fancies, more than to the Conſciences of People, generally ſoon vaniſh and expire. The cloſeſt and ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Attachment, is by the ſacred Ties of Conſcience. People ſhould eſteem Miniſters highly in Love, for their <hi>Wor<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>'s Sake,</hi> and the Glory that may thence redound to GOD, and the Good which may accrue to their own Souls. If blind and perverſe Selfiſhneſs, or Party Zeal, lead in the Choice of Miniſters, People ordinarily ſoon fall into ſome Ditch, out of which it is hard to recover. If their Affections are actuated by ſiniſter Views, and
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005956_0014_10272A04DBA3E998"/>
they have Men's Perſons in Admiration, becauſe of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; for the accompliſhing ſome revengeful, or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, or ambitious Project, they change with the Wind, and vary as the Contingencies of ſecular Affairs. Luſt, Paſſion, Humour, Intereſt, are Things very verſatile and uncertain. Whence they that are govern'd by them, muſt needs be double-minded Men, and unſtable in all their Ways. A carnal Spring may ſend forth a great Flow, a high Tide, of Affections toward Miniſters; but there is wont to follow as low an Ebb. <hi>Stony Ground Hearers</hi> are uſually affected to the Preachers, as they are to the Word it ſelf: they hear them, and anon with Joy receive them; yet have they not Root in themſelves, but are well-pleaſed for a while only; for when any Thing ariſeth a little croſſing their Humour or Intereſt, by and by they are offended. <hi>Mat.</hi> xiii. 20, 21.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The <hi>Malice</hi> and <hi>Hand</hi> of <hi>Satan</hi> may be induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly employed in alienating the Hearts of People from their Miniſters. That it was ſo in the Caſe of the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians,</hi> with Reſpect to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> may be clearly inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by his ſpeaking of them as a <hi>bewitched</hi> People. Chap. iii. ver. 1. <hi>O fooliſh Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye ſhould not obey the Truth?</hi>— And ſo count me your <hi>Enemy</hi> for telling it you? Heretical Teachers, which ſeduced them, were a Sort of ſpiritual Sorcerers, aſſiſted by the Devil, in caſting ſuch Miſts before the Eyes of their Minds, that they were led away with the Error of the Wicked, and fell from their own Stedfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The Devil may have conſiderable, though an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible, Hand, in the Operations of all the forementioned Cauſes, in the malignant Influence of all the Occaſions, whereby People are alienated from their Miniſters.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paul</hi>'s Thorn in the Fleſh, the chief Infirmity of it, through which he preached the Goſpel, was the <hi>Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Satan</hi> buffetting him, 2 Cor. xii. 7. Fitly doth he ſo call it, though it might not be an <hi>evil Angel</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:005956_0015_10272A07D1EB91F8"/>
troubling and vexing him, as <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, but a cruel Perſecutor, whom the Devil ſtirred up againſt him.</p>
            <p>All the <hi>Briars</hi> and <hi>Thorns,</hi> that are with faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and the <hi>Scorpions,</hi> among whom they ſometimes dwell, are <hi>Meſſengers</hi> of <hi>Satan,</hi> deſign'd and improv'd by him, for their Affliction and Hurt; but permitted and over-ruled by GOD, for their Humiliation and Good.</p>
            <p>By the Spirit that worketh in the Children of Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, they are ſometimes filled with Wrath, with Envy, and Indignation, with Madneſs and Contradiction, againſt thoſe who tell them the Truth.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Father of Lies,</hi> by high Pretences to Truth, when he is transformed into an Angel of Light, ſtirreth up bitter Zeal againſt the faithful Preachers of it: And by ſetting one Part of GOD's Truth in Oppoſition to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, doth cauſe Men to reject it, and them that maintain the Conſiſtence, and are ſet for the Defence, of the whole.</p>
            <p>The Tempter is ſubtil and active to hinder Miniſters in their Work, that, failing therein by Infirmity, by Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, or Pravity, they may incur the Cenſure of good People, and bring their Office, as well as Perſons, into Contempt among the Profane. The <hi>great red Dragon's Tail drew a third Part of the Stars of Heaven, and did caſt them to the Earth.</hi> Rev. xii. 4. Many are the baſe Arts, Inſtruments, and Means, which the Devil uſeth to hinder the Shining and Influence of the ſpiritual Stars, in the Firmament of the Church — to cauſe them to fall from their heavenly Profeſſion into the Dirt of this World and an earthly Courſe of Life, which renders them vile and uſeleſs.</p>
            <p>Such being the common Occaſions and Cauſes of the Alienation of People's Affections from Miniſters, that
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:005956_0016_10272A09AB9E6990"/>
were at firſt very welcome and dear to them; <hi>Both</hi> may receive <hi>Inſtruction</hi> therefrom.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Miniſters may not reckon upon the long Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of People's warm Affections towards them. If at his firſt preaching the Goſpel to a People, a Miniſter is not deſpiſed nor rejected, for any Infirmity of the Fleſh, if they receive him as an <hi>Angel of GOD,</hi> even as CHRIST JESUS; and they would part with their Eyes, rather than with him: Yet this Bleſſedneſs may be ſhort-liv'd, may very ſoon vaniſh, and he in their Miſ-apprehenſion and Male-treatment of him, become their Enemy Let him not therefore, as a <hi>Novice,</hi> be lifted up with Pride, when he ſits higheſt in the Eſtimation of People, and is enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with their loudeſt Applauſes. There may be a ſudden Change of their Diſpoſition and Behaviour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him. And if ſo, though it will be grievous unto him to ſee his People, from whom he ſhould have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, decline in their Regards for him, and grow into a Wearineſs and Diſlike of him; yet, let him not think ſtrange concerning this Trial of his Fidelity to CHRIST and Love for them, as if ſome ſtrange Thing had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to him. This is a Temptation common unto Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters. "It has been an old Practice among Profeſſors, not to like their Paſtors long."</p>
            <p n="2">2. Miniſters ſhould take heed to themſelves, that they do not, by their own Default, looſe the People's Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. It is unworthy the Character—it is below the Spirit of Goſpel-Miniſters, to pleaſe all Men, but for their Profit. They ſtudy to approve themſelves unto GOD; and at the ſame Time, to ſecure their Intereſt in the Affections of People, <hi>Not</hi> (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians,</hi> Chap. iv. ver. 17.) <hi>becauſe they deſire a Gift; but deſire Fruit that may abound to their Account.</hi> And ſince People are ſo apt to take Offence, Miniſters need be the more careful that they give none. 2 Cor. vi. 3. <hi>Giving no Offence in any Thing, that the Miniſtry be not
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:005956_0017_10272A0DC30A7140"/>
blamed.</hi> That no Man deſpiſe them, how prudent, as well as faithful, ought they to be, in their whole Conduct?</p>
            <p>And ſuch of them as for a good End ſeek to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their own Credit among the People, will not go about to weaken the Reputation of others, their Fellow-Labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; will be as far from inſinuating any Thing to their Diſadvantage in the Miniſtry, as from doing any Thing to their own— Be far from depreciating, and running down others, that they may advance and magnify them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves— far from endeavouring to exclude others, that they may ingratiate themſelves, and poſſeſs all the Room in the Hearts of People. For they are deſirous of others Uſefulneſs and Succeſs in the Miniſtry, as well as of their own. If the Glory of GOD, and the Churches Good be not the End of Miniſters, they are not Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; and may not this End be attained by our Brethren's Gifts, as well as by ear's? Should one Workman ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lign another, that helpeth him to do his Maſter's Work? Alas! that ever there ſhould be ſuch a Thing as <hi>Envy,</hi> among Fellow-Workers to the Kingdom of GOD! Any Strife between the Servants of the humble JESUS, which of them ſhould be greateſt in the Opinion of Men, and any Endeavours, if not open and notorious, yet ſly and plauſible, to diſgrace, and ſupplant one another! Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telouſly tender ſhould they all be of their own, and each other's Intereſt in the good Eſteem and Affections of People. Yet</p>
            <p n="3">3. Miniſters muſt tell People the <hi>Truth,</hi> although they ſhould count, and call them their Enemies therefor. Wo to them that ſell the Truth of GOD at ſo low a Price, as the Favour of Men! 'Do I now (ſays the Apoſtle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> Chap. i. ver. 10.) perſuade Men, or GOD? or do I ſeek to pleaſe Men? For if I yet pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men, I ſhould not be the Servant of CHRIST.'—i. e. If I ſo far pleaſed them, as not to tell them the Truth; but accommodated my Preaching to their falſe Notions,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:005956_0018_10272A1090580178"/>
corrupt Humours, and favourite Luſts. If Miniſters to gain, or keep, the Affections of People, that cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure <hi>ſound Doctrine,</hi> ſpeak not <hi>the Things that become it;</hi> if they handle the Word of GOD deceitfully, ſophiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating and adulterating of it, and ſo tempering it to the vitious Palates of Men; they are really their Enemies, Betrayers, and Murderers of Souls. They cannot be pure from the Blood of all Men, if, to avoid their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, they ſhun to declare unto them all the Counſel of GOD. And had we not rather our People ſhould account us their Enemies, for telling them the Truth; than we be found ſuch, for concealing it from them? What is the Clamour of their Tongues againſt us in this World, to the Cry of their Blood for ever in the next? O, let us not, to prevent their Murmurings, or to obtain their Commendations now, expoſe our ſelves to their ſore Complaints, fierce Accuſations, and deſperate Curſes hereafter. Can we imagine damned Angels will be more uncomfortable Aſſociates in Miſery, than poor wretched Souls, miſled by us into the ſame Place of Torments? O that there never in this Land, may be Occaſion and Ground for that Complaint, in Jer. v. 30, 31. <hi>A won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful and horrible Thing is committed in the Land. The Prophets propheſy falſly, and the Prieſts bear Rule by their Means, and my People love to have it ſo. And what will ye do in the End thereof?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Faithful Miniſters and Friends to Souls, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that they have ſuffered, and been ſhamefully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, as ye know, will be <hi>bold</hi> in GOD, to ſpeak unto People the Goſpel of GOD with much Contention.</p>
            <p>As Miniſters ſhould open their Mouth boldly, to make known the Myſtery of the Goſpel, ſo let them do it with <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> in the fitteſt Time and Manner. The Truth may be deliver'd by them ſo unſeaſonably, ſo indigeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, ſo incoherently, ſo improperly, as to prejudice the Minds of People againſt it.— As may "rather open
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:005956_0019_10272A134FA7A120"/>
than ſtop the Mouths of Gainſayers, and ſooner diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit the Truth, than convert the Adverſary." CHRIST ſpake the Word unto the People, as they were able to hear it. <hi>Mark</hi> iv. 33. I have (ſaid he to his Diſciples) yet many Things to ſay unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. <hi>John</hi> xvi. 12. Miniſters are to teach accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to People's Need and Ability to learn. It is better for them to ſtoop too low, than to ſoar too high:— to feed Men with <hi>Milk,</hi> than to choke Children with <hi>ſtrong Meat.</hi> The Tongue of the Wiſe uſeth Knowledge aright.</p>
            <p>But, if notwithſtanding all the Fidelity and Prudence we can uſe, in telling People the Truth, they will treat us as Enemies therefor, yet muſt we perſevere in our Duty; and ſpeak GOD's Word to them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear: and very gladly ſpend, and be ſpent for their Souls, though the more abundantly we love them, the leſs we be loved.</p>
            <p n="4">4. People ſhould be admoniſhed to watch their Hearts, and not let their Affections ſoon cool towards, and be alienated from their faithful Miniſters: not to miſtake them for their Enemies, who tell them <hi>the Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Brethren, We whoſe Office it is to do ſo, warn you thus, not for that we would have Dominion over your Faith, but would be Helpers of your Joy. All that we preach unto you, we would have you compare with the Standard of Truth. Search the Scriptures daily, whether thoſe Things we tell you are ſo.

            <p>But if it be the Truth we tell you, in all the neceſſary and eſſential Articles of it; count us not your Enemies, ſhould we happen to oppoſe ſome By-Opinion, or falſe Way of yours.

It was GOD's ſolemn Charge to his People of old, <hi>Take heed unto thy ſelf, that thou forſake not the</hi> Levite, <hi>as long as thou liveſt on the Earth.</hi> Deut. xii. 19. Our LORD's Words to his Apoſtles mightily enforce this Caution, <hi>Matth.</hi> xi. 40. "He that receiveth you, receiveth me; and he that receiveth me, receiveth him that ſent me." <hi>Luke</hi> x. 16. "He that heareth you, heareth me; and he that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me, and he that deſpiſeth me, deſpiſeth him that ſent me." Were not the Honour of their divine Maſter, and the Welfare of immortal Souls, nearly concerned in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception which good Miniſters of JESUS CHRIST meet with, they would not be very ſollicitous about it. They don't live upon the popular Air, the Opinion and Breath of Men: but upon the Credit they have with GOD,— the Approbation which their Perſons and Performances find with him. It is, on their own Account, a very ſmall Thing with them to be judged, — deſpiſed and rejected of Men. And they don't, for their own Sake, court the People's Affections, nor complain of the Alienation thereof, from them. Did no Diſhonour redound to CHRIST, nor Damage to the Souls of Men, they could be content to be made the Filth of the World, and Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcouring of all Things, as they too much have been from the Apoſtles to the preſent Days: At leaſt, they would not ſo often, as they now find Occaſion therefor, enter ſuch a Caution as this; which they do more out of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard

to other's Safety, than to their own Reputation. 2 Cor. xiii. 6, 7, 8, 9. 'But I truſt that ye ſhall know that we are not Reprobates. Now I pray to GOD, that ye do no Evil: not that we ſhould appear approved, but that ye ſhould do that which is honeſt, though we be as Reprobates. For we can do nothing againſt the Truth, but for the Truth. For we are glad when we are weak, and ye are ſtrong: and this alſo we wiſh, even your Perfection.'</p>

And finally, It is a <hi>Bleſſedneſs</hi> worthy of ſpecial Notice, and to be thankfully acknowledged, when People retain the warm Affections they had toward their faithful Miniſters, at their firſt preaching the Goſpel unto them. The Queſtion in the Text may be aſk'd, <hi>Where is the Bleſſedneſs</hi> you ſpeak of? Alas! that ſo many Chriſtian Societies in the Land muſt ſay, <hi>it is not</hi> enjoy'd among us. But, bleſſed be the GOD of Love and Peace, it is to be found in ſome of our Churches.— And we hope it will be in this, with which we have Communion in the ſolemn joyous <hi>Tranſaction</hi> of the preſent Day.</p>

               <hi>Honoured and Beloved Brethren,</hi>

            <p>It was not to introduce, or inſinuate any Charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you of inconſtant Love to your late, who was your firſt Paſtor, that you have been entertain'd with ſuch a Diſcourſe at this Time: for all muſt bear you Record, that if it had been poſſible, ye would have almoſt <hi>pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out your own Eyes,</hi> rather than have parted with him: but to excite you to be like minded toward him that is now to be ſet over you in the LORD.</p>
            <p>Ye know that through <hi>Infirmity of the Fleſh,</hi> which is common to all, he preacheth the Goſpel unto you at the firſt. You appear before this great Aſſembly, to receive him as GOD's Meſſenger, CHRIST'S Ambaſſador, ſent to you. Never let him be counted your <hi>Enemy,</hi> becauſe he telleth you the <hi>Truth.</hi> While he continues to do ſo,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:005956_0022_10272A1B14D85978"/>
let him not, for any Temptation he may have in his Fleſh, be deſpiſed, or rejected by you.</p>
            <p>None (I truſt) from among your ſelves, nor abroad, will, through Envy and Strife, think to add Affliction to his Infirmities, with which he will be conſtantly hamper'd in his miniſterial Courſe. Yet, if this ſhould happen to him, let him then have the Conſolation of knowing your <hi>fervent Mind</hi> towards him; as <hi>Paul</hi> had in the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian Saints,</hi> when his Fleſh had no Reſt, but he was troubled on every Side; without were <hi>Fightings,</hi> within were <hi>Fears.</hi> 2 Cor. vii. Stand with him always in the Cauſe of Truth. And for leſſer Errors, and Sins of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, which he is ſubject to, and none are without, do not lightly forſake him.

Tit. i. 14. <hi>Not giving heed to the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Men, that turn from the Truth.</hi> But while, in the Diſcharge of all Parts of his Office, he ſhall faithfully inſtruct and eſtabliſh you in the Truth; eſteem him very highly in Love for his Works Sake: Account of him as a Miniſter of CHRIST, and Steward of the Myſteries of GOD, and your Soul's very good Friend. Believe and obey the Truth he telleth you: And let him have the Joy, (than which he can have no greater) to ſee you and your Children, walking in Truth.—And now,</p>

needs affect your thoughtful Mind with the greateſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, reſpecting your Acceptance, and Uſefulneſs, in the Work of the Miniſtry, to know how through <hi>Infirmity of the Fleſh</hi> you are to preach the Goſpel; and what Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion this, through the Levity and Corruption in Men, and ſubtil Malice of Satan, may prove of your Contempt, and Rejection, and ſo of the Hindrance of the Goſpel, and conſequently of the Hurt and Ruin of Souls, the Loſs of your own, as well as of others.</p>
            <p>The juſt Apprehenſion of this amazing Danger, will make you ſtudy to ſhew your ſelf approved unto GOD, a Workman that needeth not to be aſhamed, rightly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding the Word of Truth: And to labour by Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of the Truth, to commend your ſelf to every Man's Conſcience, in the Sight of GOD; that if any, who now receive you as an Angel of GOD, even as CHRIST JESUS, ſhould ever count you their Enemy, it may be for no other Reaſon, but becauſe you tell them the Truth. In this is comprized your whole Duty; and in doing it faithfully, you will have Comfort, and ſhall be <hi>glorious in the Eyes of the LORD,</hi> whatever be the Event, as to your being deſpiſed, or eſteemed; rejected, or well-accepted of Men.</p>
            <p>See to it, that the Truth of CHRIST be in you:—that you have an intimate, experimental, ſaving Knowledge of it: Leſt by any Means, when you have preached it to others, you your ſelf ſhould be a <hi>Caſt-away.</hi> Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently conſult the infallible Oracles of Truth: Pray for the Spirit of Truth, to lead you into all Truth: And guard againſt the Spirit of Error.— And the more ſo, becauſe of ſome ſpecial <hi>Temptation</hi> which hath hapned to you, at your firſt preaching the Goſpel. Not only real, but meerly ſuſpected Miſtakes in us, ſhould be wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly improv'd to greater Circumſpection in the Study of Truth; "which is as a Vein of Silver, encompaſſed with Earth, and mixed with Droſs."

it is not many Times eaſy, upon little Search, to diſcover on which Side the Truth lies: And a ſtiff Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to either, would (you are ſenſible) ill become a young Miniſter: And worſe ſtill, (which hath ſeem'd to have been the Caſe of ſome) an eager eſpouſing and maintaining of the Wrong, out of a Spirit of Oppoſition and Revenge. 'Tis a fooliſh gratifying the Jealouſies of others concerning him, for a Man to depart from the Faith, that he may be at a greater Diſtance from them: and to verge toward Scepticiſm, that he may appear the more free from Bigotry. Though your Temper doth not (ſo far as I have Knowledge of it) incline, or expoſe you <hi>particularly</hi> to ſuch a Miſ-ſtep, yet may you have Occaſion to watch, and pray, that you enter not into <hi>Temptation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have been pleaſed, Sir, in frequent Converſation with you, to obſerve your Thirſt after Knowledge, and inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Diſpoſition to find Truth— to prove all Things, that you might hold faſt that which is good. And you will not be offended at this friendly, cautionary Advice; Not to lean to your own Underſtanding; nor defer too great a Regard to the Judgment of any other Men, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like fallible with thoſe, you may poſſibly ſee Reaſon to diſſent from.— Not to be overtaken with the firſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of Truth: nor too peremptory in abſtruſe and intricate Points: nor haſtily reject any as falſe and abſurd, becauſe they are infolded in Myſteries, entangled with Objections, and perplexed with ſnarling Debates.</p>
            <p>Take heed to your Miniſtry, that you fulfil it, in telling People the Truth—pure, unadulterated, evangelic Truth. Propoſe it to them in its native Plainneſs and Simplicity. If in your impartial, humble Enquiries after Truth, you ſhould ſeem to find any Thing which hath not been commonly taught and known, tell it in ſuch fit Seaſon and Manner, as that it may be received, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Detriment to other, and perhaps more neceſſary Parts

of divine Truth. 'Men do not (ſaith our SAVIOUR, giving a Reaſon why he did not impoſe ſomething on his Diſciples, which many judg'd to be their preſent and important Duty) Men do not (ſays he) put new Wine into old Bottles: elſe the Bottles break, and the Wine runneth out, and the Bottles periſh.' Mat. 9.17. GOD hath laid different Streſs on Things in his Word; and ſo ſhould Miniſters in teaching of them: Though they muſt not ſhun to declare any Part of his Counſel, or give up the leaſt Point of Chriſtian Verity, on any worldly Conſideration.</p>
            <p>Be valiant for the Truth againſt all Oppoſition from the Luſts of Men, and Powers of Darkneſs. Though through Infirmity of the Fleſh you preach the Goſpel, yet may the <hi>Power of</hi> CHRIST reſt upon you, and the Arms of your Hands be made ſtrong, by the Hands of the mighty GOD of <hi>Jacob:</hi> So that from the Blood of the uncircumciſed Slain, from the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>at of the Mighty, the Bow of <hi>Jonathan</hi> turn not back empty!</p>
            <p>If, for your Faithfulneſs in telling People the Truth, any of them ſhould count you their Enemy, and be ready to pluck out your Eyes; yet, being affectionately deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of them, you muſt be willing to impart unto them, not the Goſpel of GOD only, but alſo your own Soul, becauſe they are dear unto you. Thus may you win them to the Love and Practice of the Truth: And have them for your Glory, and Crown of Rejoicing in the Preſence of our LORD JESUS CHRIST at his Coming.</p>
            <p>And GOD of his infinite Mercy grant, that we all may be united in the Truth:— That our <hi>Hearts may be comforted, being knit together in Love, and unto all the Riches of the full Aſſurance of Underſtanding, to the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of the Myſtery of GOD, and of the Father, and of</hi> CHRIST. That we may receive <hi>one another, as</hi> CHRIST <hi>alſo received us to the Glory of GOD.</hi>— That
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:005956_0026_10272A26431CE000"/>
Miniſters may <hi>receive one another, as Fellow-Helpers to the Truth:</hi> And People thankfully receive, and ſtedfaſtly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the <hi>Paſtors and Teachers,</hi> which our glorious aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended Saviour hath given; <hi>for the perfecting of the Saints, for the Work of the Miniſtry, for the edifying of the Body of</hi> CHRIST: <hi>'Till we all come in the Unity of the Faith, and of the Knowledge of the Son of GOD, unto a perfect Man, unto the Meaſure of the Stature of the Fulneſs of</hi> CHRIST: <hi>That we henceforth be no more Children, toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to and fro, and carried about with every Wind of Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, by the Sleight of Men, and cunning Craftineſs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they lie in wait to deceive: But ſpeaking the Truth in Love, may grow up into him in all Things, which is the Head, even</hi> CHRIST: <hi>From whom the whole Body fitly joined together; and compacted by that which every Joint ſupplieth, according to the effectual Working in the Meaſure of every Part, maketh Increaſe of the Body, unto the edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it ſelf in Love!</hi>
