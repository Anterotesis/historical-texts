            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT hath been ſaid of Old, That Time is the Mother of Truth, and Truth is the Daughter of Time. It is the Prerogative of the God of Truth, to know all the truth in all things at once and together: <hi>It is alſo his Glory to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal a matter, Prov. 25.2.</hi> And to bring the truth to light in that manner and meaſure, and the times appointed, as it pleaſeth him; it is our duty in all humility, and with fear and trembling to ſearch after truth, <hi>knowing that ſecret things belong to God, and only things revealed belong to us,</hi> and ſo far as they are revealed; for in many things it may be ſaid, what God is doing we know not now; but we, or others that ſucceed us, ſhall know hereafter. Omitting other Examples, I ſhall Inſtance only in the matter of <hi>Witchcraft,</hi> which on the Humane ſide, is one of the moſt hidden Works of Darkneſs, managed by the Rulers of the darkneſs of this World, to the doing of great ſpoil amongſt the Children of men: And on the Divine ſide, it is one of the moſt awful and tremendous

Judgments of God which can be inflicted on the Societies of men, eſpecially when the Lord ſhall pleaſe for his own Holy Ends to Enlarge Satans Commiſſion in more than an ordinary way.</p>
            <p>It is known to all men, that it pleaſed God ſome few years ago, to ſuffer Satan to raiſe much trouble amongſt us in that reſpect, the beginning of which was very ſmall, and looked on at firſt as an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary caſe which had fallen out before at ſeveral times in other places, &amp; would be quickly over. Only one or two perſons belonging to <hi>Salem Village</hi> about five miles from the Town being ſuſpected, were Examined, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But in the progreſs of the matter, a multitude of other perſons both in that and other Neighbour Towns, were Accuſed, Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, Impriſoned, and came to their Trials, at <hi>Salem,</hi> the County Town, where about Twenty of them Suffered as <hi>Witches;</hi> and many others in danger of the ſame Tragical End: and ſtill the number of the Accuſed increaſed unto many Scores; amongſt whom were many Perſons of unqueſtionable Credit, never under any grounds of ſuſpicion of that or any other Scandalous Evil. This brought a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Conſternation upon all ſorts of People, doubting what would be the iſſue of ſuch a dreadful Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God upon the Country; but the Lord was pleaſed ſuddenly to put a ſtop to thoſe proceedings, that there was no further trouble, as hath been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by others. But it left in the minds of men a ſad remembrance of that ſorrowful time; and a Doubt whether ſome Innocent Perſons might not

Suffer, and ſome guilty Perſons Eſcape. There is no doubt but the Judges and Juries proceeded in their Integrity, with a zeal of God againſt Sin, according to their beſt light, and according to Law and Evidence; but there is a Queſtion yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſolved, Whether ſome of the Laws, Cuſtoms and Principles uſed by the Judges and Juries in the Trials of <hi>Witches</hi> in <hi>England</hi> (which were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed as Patterns here) were not inſufficient and unſafe.</p>
            <p>As for my Self, being under the Infirmities of a decrepit Old Age, I ſtirred little abroad, and was much diſenabled (both in body and mind) from knowing and judging of Occurrents and Tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of that time: But my Reverend Brother Mr. <hi>Hale,</hi> having for above Thirty Years, been Paſtor of the Church at <hi>Beverly</hi> (but Two Miles from <hi>Salem,</hi> where the Tryals were) was frequently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and was a diligent Obſerver of all that paſſed, and being one of a Singular Prudence and Sagacity, in ſearching into the narrows of things: He hath (after much deliberation) in this Treatiſe, related the Subſtance of the Caſe as it was, and given Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons from Scripture againſt ſome of the Principles &amp; Practiſes then uſed in the Tryals of <hi>Witchcraft;</hi> and ſaid ſomething alſo in a Poſitive way, and ſhewing the right Application that is to be made of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <head>The Preface TO THE Chriſtian READER.</head>
            <p>THE Holy Scriptures inform us that the Doctrine of Godlineſs is a great Myſtery, containing the Myſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven: Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which require great ſearch for the finding out: And as the Lord hath his Myſteries to bring us to Eternal Glory; ſo Satan hath his Myſteries to bring us to Eternal Ruine: Myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries not eaſily underſtood, whereby the depths of Satan are managed in hidden wayes. So the Whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> makes the <hi>Inhabitants of the Earth drunk with the Wine of her Fornication,</hi> by the Myſtery of her abominations, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.2. And the man of Sin hath his Myſtery of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity whereby he deceiveth men through the working of Satan in ſignes and lying wonders, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2 3, 7, 9.</p>
            <p>And among Satans Myſteries of iniquity, this of <hi>Witchcraft</hi> is one of the moſt difficult to be ſearched out by the Sons of men; as appeareth
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001050_0009_0FAEF440CB8C63F0"/>
by the great endeavours of Learned and Holy men to ſearch it out, and the great differences that are found among them, in the rules laid down for the bringing to light theſe hidden works of darkneſs. So that it may ſeem pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in me to undertake ſo difficult a <hi>Theam,</hi> &amp; to lay down ſuch rules as are different from the Sentiments of many Eminent writers, and from the Preſidents and practices of able Lawyers; yea and from the Common Law it ſelf.</p>

That there hath been ſuch a dark diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation by the Lord, letting looſe upon us the Devil, <hi>Anno.</hi> 1691. &amp; 1692. as we never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced before: And thereupon apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and condemning perſons for <hi>Witchcraft</hi>; and nextly acquitting others no leſs liable to ſuch a charge; which evidently ſhew we were in the dark, and knew not what to do; but have gone too far on the one or other ſide, if not on both. Hereupon I eſteemed it neceſſary for ſome perſon to Collect a Summa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of that affair, with ſome animadverſions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, which might at leaſt give ſome light to them which come after, to ſhun thoſe Rocks by which we were bruiſed, and narrowly eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped Shipwrack upon. And I have waited five years for ſome other perſon to undertake it, who might doe it better than I can, but find none; and judge it better to do what I can,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001050_0010_0FAEF441E9774F88"/>
than that ſuch a work ſhould be left undone. Better ſincerely though weakly done, then not at all, or with ſuch a byas of prejudice as will put falſe gloſſes upon that which was managed with uprightneſs of heart, though there was not ſo great a ſpirit of diſcerning, as were to be wiſhed in ſo weighty a Concernment.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I have been preſent at ſeveral Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Tryals, and knew ſundry of thoſe that Suffered upon that account in former years, and in this laſt affair, and ſo have more advantages than a ſtranger, to give account of theſe Proceedings.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I have been from my Youth trained up in the knowledge and belief of moſt of thoſe principles I here queſtion as unſafe to be uſed. The firſt perſon that ſuffered on this account in <hi>New-England,</hi> about Fifty years ſince, was my Neighbour, and I heard much of what was charged upon her, and others in thoſe times; and the reverence I bore to aged, learned and judicious perſons, cauſed me to drink in their principles in theſe things, with a kind of Implicit Faith. <hi>Quo ſemel eſt imbuta recens ſervabit odorem, Teſta diu A Child will not eaſily forſake the principles he hath been trained up in from his Cradle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But obſerving the Events of that ſad Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtrophe, <hi>Anno</hi> 1692. I was brought to a more ſtrict ſcanning of the principles I had imbibed, and by ſcanning, to queſtion, and by queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001050_0011_0FAEF4451590A140"/>
at length to reject many of them, upon the reaſons ſhewed in the enſuing Diſcourſe. It is an approved ſaying <hi>Nihil certius, quam quod ex dubio fit certum</hi>: No truth more certain to a man, than that which he hath formerly doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or denied, and is recovered from his error, by the convincing evidence of Scripture &amp; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Yet I know and am ſenſible, that while we know but in part, man is apt in flying from a diſcovered error, to run into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary extream.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Incidit in Scyllam qui vult vitare Charybaim.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The middle way is commonly the way of truth. And if any can ſhew me a better mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle way than I have here laid down, I ſhall be ready to embrace it: But the conviction muſt not be by vinegar or drollery, but by ſtrength of argument.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I have had a deep ſence of the ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of miſtakes in matters Capital; and their impoſſibility of recovering when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated. And what grief of heart it brings to a tender conſcience, to have been unwittingly encouraging of the Sufferings of the innocent. And I hope a zeal to prevent for the future ſuch ſufferings is pardonable, although there ſhould be much weakneſs, and ſome errors in the purſuit thereof.</p>
            <p n="5">5. I obſerve the failings that have been on the one hand, have driven ſome into that which is indeed an extream on the other hand,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001050_0012_0FAEF446737D4E10"/>
and of dangerous conſequence, <hi>viz.</hi> To deny any ſuch perſons to be under the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> who by the Devils aid diſcover Secrets, or do work wonders. Therefore in the latter part of this diſcourſe, I have taken pains to prove the Affirmative, yet with brevity, becauſe it hath been done already by <hi>Perkins</hi> of <hi>Witchcraft. Glanvil</hi> his <hi>Saduciſcus Triumphatus.</hi> P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p n="6">6. I have ſpecial reaſons moving me to bear my teſtimony about theſe matters, <hi>before I go hence &amp; be no more</hi>; the which I have here done, and I hope with ſome aſſiſtance of his Spirit to whom I commit my ſelf &amp; this my labour, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that God <hi>whoſe I am &amp; whom I ſerve</hi>: De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring his Mercy in Jeſus Chriſt to Pardon all the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of his People in the day of darkneſs; and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able us to fight with Satan by Spiritural Weapons, putting on the whole Armour of God.</p>

But Devils have no ſuch Laws, or tenderneſs of Conſcience to bridle or reſtrain them. But the Lord hath his Chains, which are called Everlaſting, and are always laſting; ſo that they are never wholly without a Chain. This Chain is ſometimes greater and ſhorter, other times leſſer and

                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. The Devil is full of malice againſt man, and frames his deſigns againſt him, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to deſtroy his Soul, as, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3 and other Scriptures abundantly teſtify. Hence probably at ſometimes he doth not all the hurt to mans Body that he could, leſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he ſhould awaken man to repentance and prayer; he ſeeks to keep men in a falſe peace. <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.21. Yet at other times he diſturbs and afflicts men in Body and Eſtate; as Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and experience ſhew. Among the Devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Satan uſeth to ruine man, one is to allure him into ſuch a familiarity with him, that by Sorceries, Inchantments, Divinations, and ſuch like, he may lead them Captive at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. This ſnare of his we are warned againſt. <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.10, 11. and in other Scriptures. This Sin of men hearkening after Satan in theſe ways, is called Witchcraft; of which it is my purpoſe to treat: But firſt I ſhall ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Hiſtorically what hath been done in <hi>New England,</hi> in proſecution of perſons ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of this Crime.</p>

But ſhe conſtantly profeſſed her ſelf innocent of that crime: Then one prayed her to conſider if God did not bring this puniſhment upon her for ſome other crime, and asked, if ſhe had not been guilty of Stealing many years ago; ſhe anſwered, <hi>ſhe had ſtolen ſomething, but it was long ſince, and ſhe had repented of it, and there was Grace enough in Chriſt to pardon that long agoe; but as for Witchcraft ſhe was wholly free from it,</hi> and ſo ſhe ſaid unto her Death.</p>

Mr. <hi>Thompſon</hi> Miniſter at <hi>Brantry,</hi> and <hi>J.

Another ſuffering in this kind was a Woman of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> againſt whom a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal evidence was a <hi>Watertown</hi> Nurſe, who teſtifyed, that the ſaid <hi>Kendal</hi> (ſo was the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed called) did bewitch to Death a Child of Goodman <hi>Genings</hi> of <hi>Watertown</hi>; for the ſaid <hi>Kendal</hi> did make much of the Child, and then the Child was well, but quickly changed its colour and dyed in a few hours after. The Court took this evidence among others, the ſaid <hi>Genings</hi> not knowing of it. But after <hi>Kendal</hi> was Executed (who alſo denyed her guilt to the Death,) Mr. <hi>Rich Brown</hi> knowing &amp; hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing better things of <hi>Kendal,</hi> asked ſaid <hi>Genings</hi> if they ſuſpected her to bewitch their Child, they anſwered <hi>No.</hi> But they judged the true cauſe of the Childs Death to be thus, <hi>viz.</hi> The Nurſe had the night before carryed out the Child and
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:001050_0019_0FAEF44BB3DADF30"/>
kept it abroad in the Cold a long time, when the red gum was come out upon it, &amp; the Cold had ſtruck in the red gum, and this they judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the cauſe of the Childs death. And that ſaid <hi>Kendal</hi> did come in that day and make much of the Child, but they apprehended no wrong to come to the Child by her. After this the ſaid Nurſe was put into Priſon for A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, and there delivered of her baſe Child, and Mr. <hi>

               <p>There was another Executed, of <hi>Boſton Anno</hi> 1656. for that crime. And two or three of <hi>Springfield,</hi> one of which confeſſed; and ſaid the occaſion of her familiarity with Satan was this: She had loſt a Child and was exceedingly diſcontented at it, and longed; <hi>Oh that ſhe might ſee her Child again</hi>! And at laſt the Devil in likeneſs of her Child came to her bed ſide and talked with her, and asked to come into the bed to ner, and ſhe received it into the bed to her that night and ſeveral nights after, and ſo entred into covenant with Satan and became a Witch. This was the only confeſſor in theſe times in this Government.</p>

But it is not my purpoſe to give a full relation of all that have ſuffered for that Sin, or of all the particulars charged upon them, which probably is now impoſſible, many wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing <hi>Viva voce,</hi> thoſe particulars which were not fully recorded. But that I chiefly intend is to ſhew the principles formerly acted upon in Convicting of that Crime; which were ſuch as theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt great principle laid down by a perſon Eminent for Wiſdom, Piety and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was; That the Devil could not aſſume the ſhape of an innocent perſon in doing miſchiefs unto mankind: for if the Lord ſhould ſuffer him in this he would ſubvert the courſe of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Juſtice, by bringing men to ſuffer for what he did in their Shapes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Witchcraft</hi> being an habitual Crime, one ſingle witneſs to one Act of Witchcraft, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:001050_0021_0FAEF44CCBBFC830"/>
ſingle witneſs to another ſuch fact, made two witneſſes againſt the Crime and the party ſuſpected.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There was ſearching of the bodies of the ſuſpected for ſuch like tears, or ſpots (which writers ſpeak of) called the Devils marks; and if found, theſe were accounted a preſumption at leaſt of guilt in thoſe that had them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I obſerved that people laid great weight upon this; when things ſuppoſed to be bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed were burnt, and the ſuſpected perſon came to the fire in the time of it.

               <p n="1">1. They were not ſatisfyed that a Specter doing miſchief in her likeneſs, ſhould be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to her perſon, as a ground of guilt.</p>

She being reprived, was carried to her own home, and her Husband, (who was eſteemed a Sincere and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſtian by thoſe that knew him) deſired ſome Neighbour Miniſters, of whom I was one, to meet together and diſcourſe his Wife; the which we did: and her diſcourſe was very Chriſtian among us, and ſtill pleaded her inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence as to that which was laid to her charge. We did not eſteem it prudence for us to paſs any definitive Sentance upon one under her circumſtances, yet we inclined to the more cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable ſide.</p>

               <p n="1">I. IN the latter end of the year 1691. Mr. <hi>Samuel Paris,</hi> Paſtor of the Church in <hi>Salem-Village,</hi> had a Daughter of Nine, and a Neice of about Eleven years of Age, ſadly Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted of they knew not what Diſtempers; and he made his application to Phyſitians, yet ſtill they grew worſe: And at length one Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an gave his opinion, that they were under an Evil Hand. This the Neighbours quickly took up, and concluded they were bewitched. He had alſo an Indian Man ſervant, and his Wife who afterwards confeſſed, that without the knowledge of their Maſter or Miſtreſs, they had taken ſome of the Afflicted perſons Urine, and mixing it with meal had made a Cake, &amp; baked it, to find out the Witch, as they ſaid.
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:001050_0024_0FAEF451DC42B208"/>
After this, the Afflicted perſons cryed out of the Indian Woman, named <hi>Tituba,</hi> that ſhe did pinch, prick, and grievouſly torment them, and that they ſaw her here and there, where no body elſe could. Yea they could tell where ſhe was, and what ſhe did, when out of their humane ſight. Theſe Children were biuen and pinched by inviſible agents; their arms, necks, and backs turned this way and that way, and returned back again, ſo as it was impoſſible for them to do of themſelves, and beyond the power of any Epileptick Fits, or natural Diſeaſe to effect. Sometimes they were taken dumb, their mouths ſtopped, their throats choaked, their limbs wracked and, tormented ſo as might move an heart of ſtone, to ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thize with them, with bowels of compaſſion for them. I will not enlarge in the deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their cruel Sufferings, becauſe they were in all things afflicted as bad as <hi>John Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wins</hi> Children at <hi>Boſton,</hi> in the year 1689. So that he that will read Mr. <hi>Mathers</hi> Book of <hi>Memorable Providences, page</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may Read part of what theſe Children, and afterwards ſundry grown perſons ſuffered by the hand of Satan, at <hi>Salem</hi> Village, and parts adjacent, <hi>Anno</hi> 1691, 2. Yet there was more in theſe Sufferings, than in thoſe at <hi>Boſton,</hi> by pins in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſibly ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ons. (As in part publiſhed in a Book Printed 1693. <hi>viz. The Wonders of the Inviſible World.</hi>)
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:001050_0025_0FAEF45396728178"/>
Mr. <hi>Paris</hi> ſeeing the diſtreſſed condition of his Family, deſired the preſence of ſome Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Gentlemen of <hi>Salem,</hi> and ſome Neighbour Miniſters to conſult together at his Houſe; who when they came, and had enquired dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently into the Sufferings of the Afflicted, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded they were preternatural, and feared the hand of Satan was in them.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The advice given to Mr. <hi>Paris</hi> by them was, that he ſhould ſit ſtill and wait upon the Providence of God to ſee what time might diſcover; and to be much in prayer for the diſcovery of what was yet ſecret. They alſo Examined <hi>Tituba,</hi> who confeſſed the making a Cake, as is above mentioned, and ſaid her Miſtreſs in her own Country was a Witch, and had taught her ſome means to be uſed for the diſcovery of a Witch and for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of being bewitched, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But ſaid that ſhe her ſelf was not a Witch.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Soon after this, there were two or three private Faſts at the Miniſters Houſe, one of which was kept by ſundry Neighbour Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and after this, another in Publick at the <hi>Village,</hi> and ſeveral days afterwards of publick Humiliation, during theſe moleſtations, not only there, but in other Congregations for them. And one General Faſt by Order of the General Court, obſerved throughout the
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:001050_0026_0FAEF4544F061990"/>
Colony to ſeek the Lord that he would rebuke Satan, and be a light unto his people in this day of darkneſs.</p>
               <p>But I return to the Hiſtory of theſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. In a ſhort time after other perſons who were of age to be witneſſes, were moleſted by Satan, and in their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>its cryed out upon <hi>Tituba</hi> and Goody O. &amp; S. G. that they or Specters in their Shapes did grievouſly torment them; hereupon ſome of their Village Neighbours complained to the Magiſtrates at <hi>Salem,</hi> deſiring they would come and examine the afflicted &amp; accuſed together; the which they did: the effect of which examination was, that <hi>Tituba</hi> confeſſed ſhe was a Witch, and that ſhe with the two others accuſed did torment &amp; bewitch the complainers, and that theſe with two others whoſe names ſhe knew not, had their Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meeting together; relating the times when &amp; places where they met, with many other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances to be ſeen at large. Upon this the ſaid <hi>Tituba</hi> and O. &amp; <hi>S. G.</hi> were committed to Priſon upon ſuſpicion of acting Witchcraft. After this the ſaid <hi>Tituba</hi> was again examined in Priſon, and owned her firſt confeſſion in all points, and then was her ſelf afflicted and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of her fellow Witches tormenting of her, for her confeſſion, and accuſing them, and being ſearched by a Woman, ſhe was found to have upon her body the marks of the Devils wounding of her.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="27" facs="unknown:001050_0027_0FAEF455150CE698"/>IV. Here were theſe things rendred her confeſſion credible. (1.) That at this exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ſhe anſwered every queſtion juſt as ſhe did at the firſt. And it was thought that if ſhe had feigned her confeſſion, ſhe could not have remembred her anſwers ſo exactly. A lyar we ſay, had need of a good memory, but truth being always conſiſtent with it ſelf is the ſame to day as it was yeſterday. (2.) She ſeemed very penitent for her Sin in covenanting with the Devil. (3.) She became a ſufferer her ſelf, &amp; as ſhe ſaid for her confeſſion. (4.) Her confeſſion agreed exactly (which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards verified in the other confeſſors) with the accuſations of the afflicted. Soon after theſe afflicted perſons complained of other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons afflicting of them in their fits, and the number of the afflicted and accuſed began to increaſe. And the ſucceſs of <hi>Tituba</hi>'s confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on encouraged thoſe in Authority to examine others that were ſuſpected, and the event was, that more confeſſed themſelves guilty of the Crimes they were ſuſpected for. And thus was this matter driven on.</p>
               <p n="5">V. I obſerved in the proſecution of theſe affairs, that there was in the Juſtices, Judges &amp; others concerned, a conſcientious endeavour to do the thing that was right. And to that end they conſulted the Preſidents of former times &amp; precepts laid down by Learned Writers about

               <p n="6">VI. But that which chiefly carried on this matter to ſuch an height, was the increaſing of confeſſors till they amounted to near about Fifty: and four or ſix of them upon their try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als owned their guilt of this crime, and were condemned for the ſame, but not Executed. And many of the confeſſors confirmed their confeſſions with very ſtrong circumſtances: As their exact agreement with the accuſations of the afflicted; their punctual agreement with their fellow confeſſors; their relating the times when they covenanted with Satan, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that moved them thereunto; their Witch meetings, and that they had their mock Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Baptiſm and the Supper, in ſome of them; their ſigning the Devils book: and ſome ſhewed the Scars of the wounds which they ſaid were made to fetch blood with, to ſign the Devils book; and ſome ſaid they had
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:001050_0029_0FAEF4568EF289C0"/>
Imps to ſuck them, and ſhewed Sores raw where they ſaid they were ſucked by them.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. I ſhall give the Reader a taſt of theſe things in a few Inſtances. The Afflicted complained that the Spectres which vexed them, urged them to ſet their Hands to a Book repreſented to them (as to them it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) with threatnings of great torments, if they ſigned not, and promiſes of eaſe if they obeyed.</p>
               <p>Among theſe <hi>D. H.</hi> did as ſhe ſaid (which ſundry others confeſſed afterwards) being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome by the extremity of her pains, ſign the Book preſented, and had the promiſed eaſe; and immediately upon it a Spectre in her Shape afflicted another perſon, and ſaid, I have ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Book and have eaſe, now do you ſign, and ſo ſhall you have eaſe. And one day this afflicted perſon pointed at a certain place in the room, and ſaid, there is <hi>D. H.</hi> upon which a man with his Rapier ſtruck at the place, though he ſaw no Shape; and the Afflicted called out, ſaying, you have wounded her ſide, and ſoon after the afflicted perſon pointed at another place, ſaying, there ſhe is; whereupon a man ſtruck at the place, and the afflicted ſaid, you have given her a ſmall prick about the eye. Soon after this, the ſaid <hi>D. H.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed her ſelf to be made a Witch by ſigning the Devils Book as above ſaid; and declared
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:001050_0030_0FAEF4574B8E57F0"/>
that ſhe had afflicted the Maid that complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of her, and in doing of it had received two wounds by a Sword or Rapier, a ſmall one about the eye, which ſhe ſhewed to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This <hi>D. H.</hi> confeſſed that ſhe was at a Witch Meeting at <hi>Salem Village,</hi> where were many perſons that ſhe named, ſome of whom were in Priſon then or ſoon after upon ſuſpicion of Witchcraft: And the ſaid <hi>G. B</hi> preached to them, and ſuch a Woman was their Deacon, and there they had a Sacrament.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Several others after this confeſſed the ſame things with <hi>D.

I enquired what ſhe did for Victuals; ſhe anſwered, that ſhe carried Bread and Cheeſe in her pocket, and that ſhe and the <hi>Andover</hi> Company came to the Village before the Meeting began, and ſat down toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther under a tree and eat their food, and that ſhe drank water out of a Brook to quench her thirſt. And that the Meeting was upon a plain graſſy place, by which was a Cart path, and ſandy ground in the path, in which were the tracks of Horſes feet. And ſhe alſo told me how long they were going and returning. And ſome time after told me, ſhe had ſome trouble upon her ſpirit, and when I enquired what? ſhe ſaid, ſhe was in fear that <hi>G. B.</hi> and <hi>M. C.</hi> would kill her; for they appeared unto her (in Spectre, for their perſons were kept In other Rooms in the Priſon) and brought a ſharp pointed iron like a ſpindle, but four ſquare, and threatned to ſtab her to death with it; becauſe ſhe had confeſſed her Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, and told of them, that they were with her, and that <hi>M.

               <p>
                  <hi>M. C.</hi> had to witneſs againſt her, two or three of her own Children, and ſeveral of her Neighbours that ſaid they were in confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy with her in their Witchcraft.</p>

But alas, I am weary with relating particulars; thoſe that would ſee more of this kind, let them have recourſe to the Records.</p>
               <p>By theſe things you ſee how this matter was carried on, <hi>viz.</hi> chiefly by the complaints and accuſations of the Afflicted. Bewitched ones as it was ſuppoſed, and then by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of the Accuſed, condemning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:001050_0036_0FAEF45E0982E408"/>
and others. Yet experience ſhewed, that the more there were apprehended, the more were ſtill Afflicted by Satan, and the number of Confeſſors increaſing, did but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the number of the Accuſed, and the Executing ſome, made way for the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of others; for ſtill the Afflicted com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of being tormented by new objects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the former were removed.

                  </gap> that Crime. And at laſt it was evidently ſeen that there muſt be a ſtop put, or the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Children of God would fall under that condemnation.</p>
               <p>Henceforth therefore the Juries generally acquitted ſuch as were Tried, fearing they had gone too far before. And Sir <hi>William Phips,</hi> Governour, Reprieved all that were Condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, even the Confeſſors, as well as others And the Confeſſors generally fell off from their Confeſſions; ſome ſaying, they remembred no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of what they ſaid; others ſaid they had belied themſelves and others. Some brake Priſon and ran away, and were not ſtrictly ſearched after, ſome acquitted, ſome diſmiſſed, and one way or other all that had been accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed were ſet or left at liberty.</p>
               <p>And although had the times been calm, the
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:001050_0037_0FAEF45EFAEDA5C8"/>
condition of the Confeſſors might have called for a <hi>melius inquirendum</hi>; yet conſidering the combuſtion and confuſion this matter had brought us unto; it was thought ſafer to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der do than over-do, eſpecially in matters Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital, where what is once compleated cannot be retrieved: but what is left at one time, may be corrected at another, upon a review and clearer diſcovery of the ſtate of the Caſe.

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. I have heard it ſaid, That the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents in <hi>England</hi> were not ſo exactly followed, becauſe in thoſe there had been previous quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels and threatnings of the Afflicted by thoſe that were Condemned for Witchcraft; but here, ſay they, not ſo. To which I anſwer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In many of theſe caſes there had been antecedent perſonal quarrels, and ſo occaſions of revenge; for ſome of thoſe Condemned, had been ſuſpected by their Neighbours ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral years, becauſe after quarrelling with their Neighbours, evils had befallen thoſe Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.

there were other like Caſes not Printed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Several confeſſors acknowledged they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the quarrels of other their confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates to afflict perſons. As one <hi>Timothy Swan</hi> ſuffered great thin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3 There were others that confeſſed their fellowſhip in theſe works of darkneſs, was to deſtroy the Church of God (as is above in part rehearſed) which is a greater piece of revenge, then to be avenged upon one particular perſon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It may be queried then, <hi>How doth it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that there was a going too far in this affair</hi>?</p>

                  </hi> 1. By the numbers of the perſons accuſed which at length increaſed to about an <hi>hundred,</hi> and it cannot be imagined that in a place of ſo much knowledge, ſo many in ſo ſmall a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of Land ſhould ſo abominably leap into the Devils lap at once.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The quality of ſeveral of the accuſed was ſuch as did beſpeak better things, <hi>and things that accompany Salvation.</hi> Perſons whoſe blameleſs and holy lives before did teſtify for them. Perſons that had taken great pains to bring up their <hi>Children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord</hi>: Such as we had Charity for, as for our

own Souls: and Charity is a Chriſtian duty commended to us. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. <hi>Chapt. Col.</hi> 3.14. and in many other Scriptures.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The number of the afflicted by Satan dayly increaſed, till about Fifty perſons were thus vexed by the Devil. This gave juſt ground to ſuſpect ſome miſtake, which gave advantage to the accuſer of the Brethren to make a breach upon us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It was conſiderable that Nineteen were Executed, and all denyed the Crime to the Death, and ſome of them were knowing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, &amp; had before this been accounted blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs livers. And it is not to be imagined, but that if all had been guilty, ſome would have had ſo much tenderneſs as to ſeek Mercy for their Souls in the way of Confeſſion &amp; ſorrow for ſuch a Sin. And as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="5">5. When this proſecution ceaſed, the Lord ſo chained up Satan, that the afflicted grew pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently well. The accuſed are generally quiet, and for five years ſince, we have no ſuch mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtations by them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It ſways much with me that I have ſince heard and read, of the like miſtakes in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places. As in <hi>Suffolk</hi> in <hi>England</hi> about the year 1645, was ſuch a proſecution, until they

                  </gap>tion of a perſon to the ſick (or obſeſſed) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in their fits, may be often times only to their Imaginations. Some of our afflicted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have when they come out of their fits de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that in them they ſaw an army of men in rank &amp; file; other times the repreſentation of heavenly beauty, white men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain fire and helliſh torments. Now all theſe might be only the working of their Phantaſies, by Satans preſentations to Imagination, and the like may be of other things and perſons.

Therefore that which Satan ſet before the eyes of Chriſt, was not all the Kingdoms of the World themſelves, but an image and repreſentation of them, and of their Glory, which Satan had framed. And of theſe might Satan ſay, as, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4 6. <hi>All this power will I give thee and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me, and to whomſoever I will, I give it.</hi> If then Satan can make an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the Kingdoms of the World, and of their glory which is the greater, then can he make the Image of a man, which is the leſſer, and appear to man in ſuch an image: And ſo appearing can ſpeak and act in and by it as he ſpake and acted of old by the Serpent unto <hi>Eve,</hi> and by the Poſſeſſed in the Goſpel. Whether Satan makes ſuch a viſible body by gathering the rays called <hi>Species Viſibiles,</hi> which flow from every body, whereby its ſhadow is repreſented in a Looking-glaſs and Water, or

as the rays of the Sun inviſibly ſcattered in the Air are by a burning glaſs contracted and condenſed ſo as to kindle a Fire, or by other means, I determine not. But Hiſtory as well as the Scripture abundantly teſtifie, that ſuch Spirits, or Aieral Bodies have appeared unto men, called Apparitions or Ghoſts.

But I ſpare to enlarge.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Propoſition</hi> is, Satan may repreſent himſelf doing miſchief in the ſhape of an innocent perſon, without prejudice to, or perverting of Gods Ordinance of Civil Juſtice.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If Satan (can aſſume the likeneſs of a man, as is above proved) then it's alike eaſy in it ſelf for him to perſonate an innocent, as a guilty perſon, if we look to his natural pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: For according to natural cauſes by which he worketh, ones Image is as eaſily formed as the others. And no doubt he will ſometimes perſonate the innocent, unleſs the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain him.</p>

If the ſuppoſed perſon come into the room through the Key hole, or when there is no place open for a perſon to come in by, then conclude, its not the perſon but the Devil ſeen there. A Spectre can come in by a pin-hole: but Satan cannot bring in the body of a man or woman in at ſuch a place: for if ſo then Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan could work a miracle property ſo called, which he cannot do.

The turning <hi>Lots</hi> Wife into a pillar of Salt was a proper Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle beyond the power of Devil or Angel of themſelves to perform. But a Spectre can change its ſhape like the Wind under Ice run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning upon the water. This well weighed will confute many fond Stories that have paſſed, that ſuch a Woman is a Witch, for ſhe was ſeen in her full proportion, and then turned into a Cat, and back at laſt into a Woman; for all this was either a phantaſie in the brains, or a Phantaſma before the Eyes.</p>
               <p n="5">5 If a perſon (or ſo eſteemed) paſs by us on the ſoft Snow, or dirt, and leave no foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps behind them, this is to be eſteemed a Spectre, and not the real perſon, unleſs the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon were carried by Satan in the Air. This was brought for an Evidence againſt a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that ſhe was ſeen nigh <hi>Malden</hi> in a Moonſhiny night paſſing on the Snow, and left no footſteps behind her; when ſhe might be in her Houſe at <hi>Newbury,</hi> and either the Phantaſie of the Witneſs was abuſed, or a Spectre paſſed by him in her Image. Yet if it had been her perſon ſo carried by Satan, this would not prove her a Witch, unleſs her conſent were given to it. <hi>Goodwins</hi> Children were carried in the Air by Satan, as ſaith <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable Providences.

                  <pb n="50" facs="unknown:001050_0050_0FAEF46E8DA04030"/>6. If the prints of biting of teeth, pinching with fingers, pricking with pins or irons be made on the Bodies of the Afflicted, and no hand, mouth or Body can be ſeen or felt to do it, this is to be imputed to Satan, and not to a real perſon doing of it.</p>
               <p>By theſe or ſuch like means, due circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection being uſed, when Satan perſonates the innocent, his fallacy and malice may be diſcovered, at leaſt ordinarily. Yet if the Lord ſhould ſuffer Satan ſo to act, and not be diſcovered after all means uſed to find the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy (which I never yet read or heard he did) this muſt be reckoned among the unſearcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble acts of Divine Soveraignty, which men may humbly admire; but not make rules up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch a ſuppoſal for humane judicature to proceed upon. Theſe premiſes conſidered, we may inter, That if Satan may perſonate an innocent party to one tormented by him; then, if the Lord permit it, to two, yea to ten. And if once he may do ſo, then twice, yea, twenty times, if ſuffered, and yet the perſon ſo repreſented be innocent. And all the danger of injuſtice being done to that innocent party, ariſeth not from Satans acting, ſo much as from mans miſtaken faith and ſuſpicion about Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans act.</p>
               <p>Hence then we may confute a vulgar error of people, that will conclude, that ſuch a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is, or was a Witch, for ſhe was ſeen in

               <p>ANother Principle much inſiſted on, is; That the Devil when he doth harm to perſons in their Body or Eſtate, it is (at leaſt moſt commonly, generally and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) by the help of our Neighbour: That is, ſome Witch or Conjurer, or ſuch like in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with the Devil. Sir <hi>Matthew Hale,</hi> in his Printed Obſervations upon the Tryal of thoſe Witches he Condemned, (Printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1682) draws this inference from hence, That
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:001050_0052_0FAEF4701008A510"/>
the Devil when he hurts the Body or Goods of men, is in ſome ſort ſubject to Humane Juſtice, though not in himſelf, yet in his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant Servants, by whom he is ſet a work to do ſuch miſchiefs.</p>
               <p>The unſoundneſs of this principle appeareth by the Scripture inſtances of Satans ſo afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man when we read of no Witch to ſet him on work. As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. When God let Satan looſe to try <hi>Jobs</hi> patience, <hi>Job</hi> 1 <hi>&amp;</hi> 2 <hi>Chap.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. When Satan bound the Body of a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Abraham</hi> eighteen years.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When Satan tryed the affections of the <hi>Gergeſens,</hi> and was Gods Inſtrument to puniſh their Worldlineſs by drowning their Swine, who ran violently down a ſteep place (as if they had been bewitched, according to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of many now a days) into the Sea, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing driven of the Devils.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We have many Inſtances of the poſſeſſed with the unclean Spirits that were tormented and vexed by Satan, to quicken men to prayer, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.21. and to ſhew Chriſts power.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Some by their own preſumptuous deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Satan, have given him power, or at leaſt opportunity to ſtrip and wound them; as the <hi>Exorciſts, Acts</hi> 19.13. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seeing then we have ſo many inſtances of Satans afflicting, without Witches help, and no clear Scripture inſtance of his afflicting

mankind in Body, or Eſtate by Witchcraft; It's unſafe to conclude generally that thoſe that are under Diabolical moleſtations are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched. For when perſons are perſwaded their Relations are bewitched, they preſently enquire, who is the Witch? and who ſhould they faſten their ſuſpicions upon, but on theſe that the Afflicted cry out againſt in their fits?</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>But is it not evident, that the Afflicted at</hi> Salem <hi>Village, and parts adjacent,</hi> Anno 1691, 2. <hi>were Bewitched</hi>?</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> Whether thoſe Sufferings by Satan pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded at firſt from Witchcraft or no, I ſhall leave to a further diſquiſition.</p>
               <p>But as for the moſt of thoſe Sufferers, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive they were ſuch as in the Goſpel are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Daimonizomenoi. Mat.</hi> 4 24. <hi>Daemoniaci Daemoniacks</hi>: I do not mean in that degree of Internal Poſſeſſion, as thoſe out of whom the Spirits were caſt out. <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.16. But with ſuch a degree of external poſſeſſion or obſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Satan, which rendred them like the <hi>Demoniacks</hi> mentioned, in many things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As they were grievouſly vexed with the Devil. (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) as the Damſel. <hi>Matt</hi> 15.22. compare this with <hi>Mark</hi> 7.25. She had an unclean Spirit. So were ours vexed with inviſible agents, biting, pricking, pinching and vexing of them.</p>
               <p>I will not ſay but among ſo many thus Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, ſome of them at ſome time might
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:001050_0054_0FAEF473C5805EF8"/>
counterfeit part of their Sufferings, and it might be from Satans policy to intangle the whole affair. But for the moſt part they were as thoſe we read of, <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.18. <hi>Vexed with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Spirits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. We read, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.15. of them that <hi>oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fell into the fire and into the water, being Lunatick</hi>; but were caſt this way &amp; that by an Evil Spirit. <hi>Mark</hi> 9.17, <hi>to</hi> 30. So were ſome of ours by an evil ſpirit tranſported from place to place, and in danger of being burnt, or drowned, but that Satan was reſtrained, as in caſe above ſaid.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The poſſeſſed man, <hi>Mark.</hi> 5.4. had more than humane ſtrength in breaking fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and chains. So ſome of theſe in their fits performed that which was above their own ſtrength.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The poſſeſſed damſel, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.16 did by the Devil ſoothſay; that is, diſcover ſecrets in a prophetical way: (ſhe did <hi>manteuein.</hi>) So ſome of theſe did by the Devils means tell of perſons and things, abſent and future, as when ſuch another fit ſhould come again, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where ſuch a perſon abſent was, and what he did: inſomuch that had they been <hi>Sui juris,</hi> perſons free from Diabolical obſeſſion, and overpower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing force, they might juſtly have been queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for dealing with a familiar Spirit. But the force they were under was their vindication, as it was here, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.16.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="55" facs="unknown:001050_0055_0FAEF473D3642068"/>5. The poſſeſſed of old were ſome of them exceeding fierce. <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.28. So were ſome of theſe afflicted perſons fierce, troubleſome and miſchievous in their fits, beyond their natural temper and behaviours at other times. From theſe things compared together, why may we not judge theſe demoniacks, as well as thoſe in the Goſpel? And that its poſſible for Satan in theſe times to afflict thus without Witches, as well as in thoſe? Seeing theſe did alſo in their fits <hi>fome, gnaſh their teeth and pine away,</hi> as he did, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.18.</p>
               <p>And here we may obſerve the weakneſs of the ſigns given by the <hi>Common Law,</hi> to know who is bewitched; (which ſigns as <hi>Keeble</hi> ſaith, are taken out of the tryals in <hi>Lanehaſhire,</hi> and from <hi>Bernard</hi>:)</p>
               <p>For the firſt ſign given is; The waſting of a perſon and the cauſe unknown: This ſign is very fallible: for,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The waſting may proceed from an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known diſeaſe. And the ignorance of Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians may aſcribe that to Witchcraft which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from a natural hidden diſeaſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Jobs</hi> ſore boyles from head to foot came from Satan without Witchcraft, and the cauſe of them was moſt probably hidden from the common practice of Phyſitians.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſign they give is, When two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are taken together in the like ſtrange fits. This may be a ſign of perſons poſſeſſed, and
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:001050_0056_0FAEF4750B393310"/>
hapned often in the experiences at <hi>Salem,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the perſons poſſeſſed, as aboveſaid</p>
               <p>The third ſign given is, When the afflicted party truly telleth what the ſuſpected perſon is doing at a diſtance. This is rather a ſign of a perſon poſſeſſed.</p>
               <p>And we find the two men poſſeſſed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 23 <hi>&amp;c.</hi> had like fits, for both kept among the Tombs, both were exceeding fierce, ſo as to hinder perſons paſſing that way, both together made the ſame outcry to Jeſus, that he ſhould not torment them. Theſe things ſhew a unity among the Devils afflicting them: but no unity of Witches joyning with them.</p>
               <p>Fourth ſign is, When the afflicted out of their fits know nothing what they did, or ſaid in them. But this (if our obſeſſed or poſſeſſed perſons ſaid truly) often fell out in the tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at <hi>Salem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifth ſign, Supernatural ſtrength in their fits. Now this is a ſign of the poſſeſſed, <hi>Mark</hi> 5.4. Who in their fits brake chaines and fetters.</p>
               <p>Sixth ſign is, When the afflicted vomit pins, nailes, irons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To this I ſay, whether theſe pins, nailes, <hi>&amp;c</hi> are by the Devil brought invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly to the mouths of the perſons ſo vomiting and ſo caſt out from their mouths, but not out of their ſtomacks or throats; or whether they are inſenſibly conveyed by the working of Satan into the ſtomacks or throats of the perſons vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting, and ſo vomited forth, neither the one
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:001050_0057_0FAEF4754E09A4A8"/>
nor the other, can certainly prove the vomiter bewitched, unleſs it be made manifeſt that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan doth thus vex the party by confederacy with a Witch. But where Satan hath a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to vex and poſſeſs a perſon he may do theſe things, as well as other things he did unto the poſſeſſed mentioned in the Goſpels.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh ſign is, The afflicted perſon having the ſight of the apparition of the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected party, and when the miſchief of a fit or the like following ſhortly after. Now it hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been already proved, that Satan can repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, to thoſe that are poſſeſſed, innocent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: it is not to be wondered that Satan ſhould repreſent to the eyes or imagination of a poſſeſſed ſufferer, a Spectre repreſenting a ſuſpected innocent perſon juſt before he caſteth them into a fit, eſpecially ſeeing hereby he gaines upon the credulity of the poſſeſſed, and their friends, for the accuſing an innocent, and it may be a godly perſon; for this helps for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his deſign as the accuſer of the brethren. <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.10.</p>
               <p>I would then from theſe conſiderations infer, That if a party handled as in the ſeven par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars above expreſſed, cannot thereby be ſaid to be bewitched, Then there is no need, unleſs ſomewhat elſe appear, to trouble our ſelves to enquire who is the Witch that troubleth ſuch a party.</p>

               <p n="3">3. ANother principle improved in theſe Enquiries is, When the party ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted looks upon the parties ſuppoſed to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched, and they are thereupon ſtruck down into a fit, as if ſtruck with a Cudgel.

For this experiment was found at the Tryals of perſons when the Accuſed ſought to clear themſelves, and it cannot be conceived that then they would act Witchcraft to haſten their own Condemnation: And no perſon can be ſaid to act Witchcraft againſt their own will and conſent.</p>
               <p>Again, we read, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.20. That when the poſſeſſed was brought unto Chriſt, and ſaw Chriſt, then the Spirit tare him, and he fell to the ground and wallowed foaming. So
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:001050_0059_0FAEF476CB2F9DF0"/>
that the Devil choſe this time and place to caſt the poſſeſſed into a fit even in the preſence of Chriſt. Let us then conſider theſe Afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be Demoniacks, and we muſt own, it's in Satans power to caſt them into a fit in the preſence, and upon the ſight of the Accuſed. And if this may increaſe the ſuſpicion againſt the Accuſed, it's for his intereſt to chuſe ſuch a time.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Another preſumption made uſe of hath been to cauſe the ſuſpected to touch the party ſuppoſed to be bewitched, and if that touch bring the party out of their fit, this hath been eſteemed by many a ſtrong ſuſpicion at leaſt, as may be read in ſome of the fore cited Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.</p>

As when a perſon is ſtung by a Snake, the application of the Body or fleſh of the ſame Snake to the wound will draw back the poyſon into its former fountain. But the truth is both theſe effects depend upon the Devils free agency: And he frames his things much according to the opinion of the Spectators, with intent to deceive.

ſuch a kind of Tryal (though allowed by <hi>Bernard</hi> as lawful to be uſed;) but ſince I have more conſidered it, I look upon it very unwarrantable to be uſed, being as it were the putting a ſtaff into the hand of Satan, to try what he will do with it. For the recovery of the party out of the Fit hereby muſt be from a natural or divine cauſe, or from the Devil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We cannot prove either of the two former and if the third, its but the Devils teſtimony, and therefore not to be uſed by us.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Another practice hath been when the party ſuſpected is in Priſon, and the Afflicted cry out they are miſerably tormented by them; If then the ſuſpected party be bound, and the afflicted perſon thereupon, have eaſe or releaſe of their fits, then this is a preſumption that the ſuſpected party is guilty. This was uſed at <hi>Iſanbal, Anno</hi> 1661. (ſee <hi>Glanvil, page</hi> 168.) and the ſucceſs anſwered the expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>But this is no ground ſo much as of ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe it depends either upon ſome phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal efficacy in binding to give the party eaſe, or upon the precontract of the ſuſpected made with Satan, or from the voluntary act of the Devil ceaſing to afflict at ſuch a time; neither of the two former can be proved: not any phyſical vertue in the binding the party; for how can cords bind a Spirit, and as for the
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:001050_0061_0FAEF47BB2D9FD78"/>
Contract with Satan, that remains yet to be proved, and if ſuch there be, yet the terms of it are to us unknown; and the Devil being a Lyar from the beginning, will keep or break his own promiſes, ſo as ſuites the intereſt of his Kingdom. So that in ſuch caſes we can aſcribe the releaſe of the afflicted only to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans agency and policy by ſuch a vile abuſing the miſchief of thoſe which make the tryal.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The like is to be ſaid when a Demoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack finds eaſe of their fits upon the apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or condemning, or Execution of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon complained againſt. For that eaſe may come by Satans policy, deſiſting his rage to confirm our error: or from Divine Favour in anſwer of prayer, or pity to the diſtreſſed.</p>

A Seventh principle is, If the party ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected appear in Spectre to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, and the afflicted give a blow with a knife, ſword, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> unto the Spectre (or ſome other in their behalf) and the Spectre ſeems wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or bleeding, or to have their garment torn, or ſlit by the blow received.

For the ground of the ſuſpicion ariſeth hence <hi>viz.</hi> That what wound or mark is given to the Spectre (that is to the Devils aerial aſſumed body) is tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thence unto the perſon ſetting this Spectre on work to afflict; or to their garments, if the mark be on that. But we have no ſufficient ground to know this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For if it muſt be ſo, it muſt be either (1.) From ſome ſympathy in nature between the Spectre and the party repreſented by it. But this we have no ground in reaſon to conclude; for whence or how ſhould ſuch a ſympathy be between an humane body, and the Devil in the Image or likeneſs of it? Or if it were, how can there come ſuch a ſympathy between the garment of a perſon and the Devil appearing in the likeneſs of that garment? Surely the garment was not in any league with Satan? (2) Or this comes to paſs by vertue of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant between Satan and this confederate: if ſo we ſay, I ask how come we to know there is ſuch an article in the bargain with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil?
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:001050_0063_0FAEF47D8A511530"/>
or if we know there were ſuch an article in their agreement, how can we tell, that the Devil will ſtand to his own Covenant? Or, (3.) This comes to paſs by the Immediate hand of God making ſuch a tranſlation of a wound <hi>&amp;c.</hi> unto a Witch that they may thereby be diſcovered; which if ſo, it is preternatural if not ſupernatural. And we have no ground from Scripture to expect ſuch a ſign from God; and therefore to expect it is to be guilty of the ſin of that Wicked Generation, that ſought after a ſign. <hi>Math.</hi> 16.4. <hi>Which ſhould not be given to them.</hi> Or (4) This tranſlation cometh (if there be any ſuch) from the Devil as a free &amp; powerful Spirit, afflicting the body or affecting the garment ſo marked: And if it be from hence, its the Devils teſtimony which ought to be no credit with mankind.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The true ſtate of this caſe ſeems to be this; That the perſon or garment ſo repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Afflicted by a Spectre was wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or bleeding, or cut or rent before. And the Devil knowing this, repreſents to the afflicted (or ſtriker at the Spectre) that part of the Spectre which anſwers the Body wounded, or garment rent or torn, the Searchers finding ſuch wounds upon, or rents about the perſon ſuſpected are ready to conclude it was done by the ſtroke at the Spectre which was done before. I ſhall confirm this by inſtances.</p>
               <p>There was at <hi>Ghelmsford,</hi> an Afflicted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:001050_0064_0FAEF47E4C52E840"/>
that in her fits cryed out againſt a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, a Neighbour, which Mr. <hi>Clark,</hi> the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of the Goſpel there could not believe guilty of ſuch a Crime. And it hapned while that woman was milking her Cow, the Cow ſtruck her with one horn upon her Forehead and fetched blood, and while ſhe was bleeding, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Spectre in her likeneſs appeared to the party Afflicted, who pointing at the Spectre, one ſtruck at the place, and the Afflicted ſaid, you have made her forehead bleed. Hereupon ſome went to the woman, and found her fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head bloody, and acquainted Mr. <hi>Clark</hi> with it; who forthwith went to the woman, and asked how her forehead became bloody, and ſhe anſwered by a blow of the Cows horn, as above ſaid, whereby he was ſatisfied that it was a deſign of Satan to render an innocent perſon ſuſpected.</p>
               <p>Another inſtance was at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> about fourty years ſince: There was a man much troubled in the night with Cats, or the Devil in their likeneſs haunting of him, whereupon he kept a light burning, and a Sword by him as he lay in bed; for he ſuſpected a Widow woman to ſend theſe Cats or Imps by Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft to bewitch him. And one night as he lay in bed, a Cat or Imp came within his reach, and he ſtruck her on the back; and upon enquiry heard this Widow had a ſore back: this confirmed his ſuſpicion of the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:001050_0065_0FAEF47F09EEC920"/>
he ſuppoſing that it came from the wound he gave the Cat. But Mr. <hi>Day</hi> the Widows Chyrurgeon cleared the matter; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, this Widow came to him and complained of a ſore in her back, and becauſe ſhe could not ſee it, deſired his help; and he found it to be a Boyl, and ripened and healed it as he uſed to do other Boyls But while this was in cure, the ſuppoſed Cat was wounded as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready rehearſed.</p>
               <p>But ſome may ſay when ſuch wounds or rents come, it's not the Spectre that's ſtruck but the real perſon or garment is there preſent, but by vertue of the Charm, or Witchcraft, a miſt is caſt between the Witch and Spectators in the room, whereby the perſon becomes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible to all of them except the bewitched Sufferer. As ſome juglers have ſeemed to creep through a Tree or Log, when indeed its only upon the Tree or Log; but by inchantment a ſhadow of the Log or Cloud is caſt over the Log between the Jugler and Spectators, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are deceived.</p>
               <p>I Anſwer, If it were ſo, then thoſe that ſtrike with Sword, or other Inſtrument, and wound the party might feel ſome body, or garment ſtopping the force of their blow; for a Body can be felt if it cannot be ſeen, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ſhewed. But when the ſtricken inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment feels no harder ſubſtance than Air to ſtop its force, and there ſeems to be a perſon in the

IF after Curſing there follows Death, or at leaſt ſome miſchief: This ſaith <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi> (in his Diſcourſe of Witchcraft, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2.) This is a preſumption. For Witches are wont to practiſe their miſchievous facts by curſing and banning. This alſo is a ſufficient matter of Examination.</p>
               <p>I acknowledge when perſons curſe or threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten others to kill them, or do other miſchief to their Bodies or Eſtates, and the miſchief threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned is performed as threatned; here is ground ſo far to ſuſpect the theatner, as to queſtion them about it, unleſs it appeareth to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by ſome other perſon or cauſe.

But as the propoſition is laid down generally by Mr. <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins,</hi> as a general rule I conceive it's unſafe.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Becauſe ſuch death, or miſchiefs oftimes proceed from other cauſes, ſo that there is no ground to impute them to Witchcraft. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some perſons are of ſuch haſty ſpirits and
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:001050_0067_0FAEF482591DDEE0"/>
unruly tongues, that their mouth is dayly full of curſing and bitterneſs, <hi>Rom</hi> 3.14.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There be few Houſe-keepers, where are many in Family and a Stock about them; but that by the hand of God, Death at ſome times enters upon ſome perſon in the Family, and Cattel ſometimes dye by Diſeaſes and Caſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: Who is there that hath an Eſtate, but at ſome times they meet with loſſes?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hence it falls out that theſe calamities, ſome of them happen at or nigh ſome one time of their angry neighbours curſing, who had curſed them ten times before, or threatned them, and yet no ſuch calamity enſued. And this their laſt threatning had no more influence upon the evil befalling the Family, than the ten cauſeleſs Curſes that went before, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.2. What then doth all this prove? A tongue ſet on fire, and it may be from hell; but not a Covenant with Hell to procure the calamities that befal their Neighbours.</p>
               <p>Again, ſome are of ſuch a ſuſpicious tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that they are apt to impute all ſad acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents that do befal them, to proceed from Witchcraft, and thereby in ſuffering times are apt to be jealous of their Neighbours that come frequently to their Houſes in their day of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, as cauſers of theſe afflictions by ſome charming or inchantment.</p>
               <p>Again, It may be Queried, Whether Satan may not ſometimes take advantage upon the
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:001050_0068_0FAEF4837273A640"/>
times when neighbours contend with, and threaten thoſe that live by them, to do ſome hurt to the Bodies or Goods of thoſe threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that thereby he may caſt upon the party threatned, the imputation of Sorcery. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs as he is <hi>the Accuſer of the Brethren, Rev.</hi> 12 He would ſo do if the Lord will permit him to indanger the life of the threatner. And who can tell but that the Lord may permit him at ſometimes ſo to do, for a juſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſuch unbridled tongues? I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that above fourty years ago, when there was a great diſcourſe about Witches; <hi>A very holy man heard his Wife ſay, ſhe deſired a ſucking Pig; and be going to a Neighbours houſe, ſaw a Sow with a litter of Pigs, and took a phantaſie to one of them in particular for his Wife, and asked the Owner for that Pig; the Owner denied him: Hereupon he went away in a great paſſion, very unſuitable to ſuch a perſon. And that very Pig left its dam and Company, and followed this man to his home.</hi> This was obſerved in the day of it, it was ſuppoſed Satan might have ſome hand in it, taking advantage upon the paſſion of ſo good a man, to render him ſuſpected by ſuch an accident if he could.</p>
               <p n="9">9. If any perſon, man or woman be noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly defamed for ſuch a party. This <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi> (<hi>eodem loco</hi>) makes a preſumption. But in truth there is no weight in this, unleſs thoſe neighbours among whom the ſuſpected party
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:001050_0069_0FAEF483ADB20F20"/>
lived had good grounds for their ſuſpicion: Becauſe many perſons have drunk in falſe principles about the tokens by which a Witch is to be known; and judge of perſons accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thoſe falſe principles (ſome of which are above recited) which may aſperſe the moſt innocent and righteous perſon living. Our Saviour was ſlandered as if he <hi>caſt out De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils by Belzebub the Prince of Devils, Mat.</hi> 12: 24. <hi>And the Diſciple is not above his Maſter, Mat.</hi> 10.25. Some perſons will put an evil conſtruction upon an innocent action, and ſo raiſe an evil fame againſt a perſon; and then others believing it, are apt to look upon other actions with a ſquint eye, and through the multiplying glaſs of their own jealouſies, make a Mole-hill ſeem a Mountain, to render an hated or deſpiſed neighbour evil ſpoken of.</p>
               <p n="10">10. If the party ſuſpected be the Son or Daughter, or Man-ſervant, or Maid ſervant, or familiar friend, near Neighbour, or old Companion of a known and convicted Witch. This may be a preſumption, ſaith <hi>Perkins.</hi> But unto all theſe it may be ſaid, there is no more ground to ſuſpect any perſon of this crime upon ſuch relations or circumſtances, then there is to preſume a perſon is a Thief, or Murderer, or Drunkard, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe he is the Child, Servant, Neighbour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of a Thief, Murderer, Drunkard, or the like, convicted
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:001050_0070_0FAEF4845B6B4980"/>
Criminal. Which may be, or may not be if the Lord incline the heart of him or her that is ſo related, to abhor ſuch wickedneſs. As the Wheat and Tares grow together in the ſame Field: So Good and Wicked in the ſame Neighbourhood, Family; yea, and lying in the ſame Bed, <hi>ſo that one ſhall be taken, and the other left, Mat.</hi> 24.40, 41. <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.34, 35, 36. The Lord ſaith, <hi>The Son ſhall not dye for the ſin of the Father, Ezek.</hi> 18.14 <hi>&amp;</hi> 21. <hi>ver.</hi> If the Son, (Servant or Neighbour, or Companion) ſeeth the ſins of his Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and doth not the like, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he ſhall not dye, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which ſhews that theſe ſo related may and ſometimes do ſee and abhor the ways of wickedneſs, thoſe ſo near unto them walk in, and abhor them, therefore they are not to be ſuſpected, meerly upon that account.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Some make this a preſumption. If a perſon ſick and dying, doth take it upon his or her Death, that ſuch an one hath bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. See <hi>Perkins Chap.</hi> 7. <hi>page</hi> 210. So <hi>Keeble</hi> on the Common Law, ſaith, the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the perſon hurt upon their death com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining againſt a perſon, that they appeared to them and bewitched them. Now in this eaſe it muſt be conſidered whether this dying perſon were not under Diabolical Moleſtations, or an abuſed phantaſie, or under ungrounded ſuſpicions of the party they complained of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were ſo ſick. And the grounds of
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:001050_0071_0FAEF4850DB6BA18"/>
their ſuſpicions are to be thorowly conſidered, before the ſurvivers make this a ground of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion. Sure all this may proceed from falſe principles (as there Expreſſed) drunk in by a well meaning, but miſtaken dying perſon.</p>

               <p n="12">12. SOme ſaith <hi>Perkins,</hi> do add this for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. If the party ſuſpected be found to have the Devils mark: for it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly thought, when the Devil maketh his Covenant with them, he always leaveth his mark behind him. <hi>Bernard</hi> makes it a ground of Conviction. (<hi>Gaul</hi> only a preſumption.) And <hi>Tertullian</hi> (who lived above 1400 years ago) ſays, It's the Devils cuſtom to mark his; and note, ſaith <hi>Bernard,</hi> That this mark is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible, and being pricked, it will not bleed, ſometimes like a teat (and the Devil ſucks, or toucheth them:) ſometimes but a blewiſh ſpot, ſometimes a red one, and ſometimes the fleſh ſunk.</p>
               <p>I conceive ſuch a mark is neither ground of conviction or ſuſpicion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the Lord ſometimes in anger, and ſometimes for tryal of his Servants, ſends ſuch marks upon the Bodies of men, as are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual; as the <hi>Emerods upon the Philiſtins,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5, 6, 7 Which made thoſe Heathens ſay, <hi>The Hand of the God of Iſrael is ſore upon us.</hi> And

               <p n="2">2. Many perſons have naturally, or by ſome ſickneſs or hurt, received ſome ſores, like, if not the ſame with thoſe they call the Devils marks. I knew a man, that lived and dyed without the leaſt ſuſpicion of that crime, that told me he had a natural iſſue upon his breaſt from his youth up, which diſtilled about a drop or two in twenty four hours, ſo that it was alwayes moiſt, and conduced much to his health. And as for the weaker Sex; The Lord hath ſaid unto <hi>Eve,</hi> and her Daughters, <hi>In ſorrow ſhall be thy Conception</hi>; but inſtanceth not in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars. But experience hath ſhewed upon ſome ſober and pious women, after hard Travels and the like, that they have had thoſe Excreſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which are called, <hi>Pili Uteri</hi> And I have been informed by a skilful Midwife that hath known vertuous women that have had thoſe Piles, and that they are without ſence of feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſometimes and after cold, handling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are apt to draw up into the Body. Satan knows who hath (by the hand of God) ſuch ſuſpected marks, which the Lord lays on them as their affliction, &amp; if he can by other means get them to be ſuſpected, and their Bodies ſearched, he will hereby expoſe them to great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:001050_0073_0FAEF486A5B78098"/>
ſuſpicion, if not Condemnation; if we take this for a ground of conviction or preſumption of guilt. But if he attains not that, yet hereby ſhall ſober and innocent perſons be expoſed to the reproach of ſuch, who when they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand God hath looſed their cord, and afflicted them, will as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>marr their path, ſet forward their calamity, and not ſpare to ſpit in their face. Job</hi> 30.10, 11, 12, 13. For he or ſhe that is ready to ſlip with his or her foot, is as a lamp deſpiſed in the thought of him that is at eaſe. And there may be ſuch Excreſcences from a natural cauſe, which yet Learned Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians cannot find out, the reaſon of Man knows but in part the Works of God, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11. 5. <hi>For he doth great things, and unſearchable; marvellous things without number.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 If we enquire how theſe are known to be the marks of one in league with Satan? It muſt come from the Confeſſion of Witches, that have owned ſuch things.</p>
               <p>Now among the many Confeſſors at <hi>Salem,</hi> there were ſundry declared they had ſuch marks on them: one in her head which ſhe ſaid the Devil in likeneſs of a bird came daily, and pecked, or ſucked. I ſaw the ſore place and there was nothing to be ſeen to make it to differ from another ſore coming by natural cauſes. Another ſaid, ſhe had the Devils mark upon her leg, which was a blew ſpot as broad as a Shilling: her Husband teſtifyed, that he ſaw the ſpot, but little ſuſpected it to be the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:001050_0074_0FAEF48AAFB55930"/>
mark. Others had ſores on other parts of their bodies, which they ſaid the Devil ſucked; but by all that, I could learn by thoſe that ſaw them, there was nothing to demonſtrate that they came in a preternatural way by Satan; but only the parties own affirmation: which whether true or falſe I leave to God and time farther to diſcover. And I ſuppoſe we had as many confeſſions and demonſtrations to render what they ſaid credible, as hath been known at any one time in ſome Ages. But be it ſo, that by the confeſſions of known Witches there have been upon ſome of the baſer ſort (as <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> ſaith) of them, ſuch teats, or marks. Theſe may come by natural cauſes, or violent caſualties, and by Satan be perverted to ſuch an uſe. But if they come from Satan immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as the confeſſors acknowledge. This can only tend to the conviction of thoſe that ſo confeſs, and where thoſe marks are found: but make nothing to the proof, or ſuſpicion of other perſons to be guilty of that crime, who having ſuch marks deny the crime, and aſcribe theſe bodily marks to other cauſes. So that its far more ſafe wholly to lay aſide the practice of ſearching after ſuſpected perſons teats or Witch marks, unleſs in thoſe who confeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to have them, and that for tryal to ſee whether they ſay true or not; then by uſing it to lay ſtreſs upon a fallible ſign.</p>

                  <pb n="75" facs="unknown:001050_0075_0FAEF48BEDCE5180"/>13. Another unſafe principle is to lay weight upon the teſtimony of Ghoſts, as they are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that is to ſay, <hi>Spectres</hi> appearing in the ſhape of the dead, and perſonating them. Satan by his wiles in this kind hath gained too much credit, in hours of Temptation. For it hath ſo happened, that when in the death of ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons there was any notice of a circumſtance which might give unto a jealous eye, any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour for ſuſpicion, that any one was acceſſary to their death; the Spectre perſonating them hath cryed out to the afflicted for vengeance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch an one for murdering them, telling the manner how, by relating the circumſtances of their death: and preſently people were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſay, I remember thoſe very circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the dying of ſuch a perſon. Well, it is very probable ſuch an one murdered the party. And hereby the perſon ſuſpected is accuſed of Witchcraft and Murder together, and by joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe accuſations together, both ſeem the more probable and credible. But that there is no reaſon to hearken to ſuch accuſations will appear if we conſider.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Satan can aſſume the ſhape of living innocents, as above ſhewed, and therefore of the dead alſo; as of dead <hi>Samuel</hi>: and that ſhape being aſſumed can ſay what he pleaſeth, or ſeem to the Imagination of <hi>daimoniacal</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſo to ſpeak. And he being <hi>a Lyar from the beginning, Joh.</hi> 8.44. By his lyes he faſtens what
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:001050_0076_0FAEF48C8A8D4758"/>
accuſation he pleaſeth of murder, or other crime upon the living. And if hearkened unto will, as the deceived <hi>Eve,</hi> by falſely accuſing God, deceive us by falſely accuſing our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to us.</p>
               <p>I know Hyſtories ſpeak of Ghoſts diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring murders, at ſometimes, and moneys loſt, or acts of injuſtice done in the life time of the perſon repreſented by the ſaid Ghoſt; which ſome have conceived to be the very Soul of the deceaſed: (and by this opinion many <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> have been confirmed in the error of <hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi>:) Some a good Angel ſent in that Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude to procure juſtice to be done: and ſome have conceived it to be the Devil compelled, <hi>Volens Nolens,</hi> to diſcover injuſtice, <hi>or tranform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf into an Angel of Light,</hi> as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.14 by ſeeming zealous for juſtice. I ſhould digreſs too far from my intended ſcope to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſs, what may be ſaid <hi>pro</hi> or <hi>con</hi> in this matter. It ſufficeth in the caſe, <hi>Anno</hi> 1692. To ſay we have had ſo much experience of the wiles of Satan appearing in the likeneſs of the living, that we have no reaſon to believe him in the likeneſs of the dead.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The hearkening after Ghoſts, if we take not heed, may hurry us unawares into that ſin forbidden, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 8.19. <hi>Viz. Seeking for the living to the dead</hi>?

               <p>A like unto this deceit of Satan, was another of his devices. <hi>Viz.</hi> He would appear Spectrally in the ſhape of a Neighbour unto the afflicted, and ſay, I killed ſuch and ſuch a perſon, and relate in that ſhape the manner of the deceaſed's departure out of the world, by plauſible and ſeemingly true circumſtances which was in the day of it, too much credited to augment Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions againſt the accuſed: But the invalidity of ſuch accuſations appears by what is already ſpoken concerning the Apparition of Ghoſts.</p>

               <p>But before we give credence to ſuch a diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, we muſt be very circumſpect leaſt we be deceived by humane knavery; as happened in a caſe nigh <hi>Richmond</hi> Iſland, <hi>circiter Anno</hi> 1659.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>One Mr.</hi> Thorpe <hi>a drunken Preacher, was got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in to Preach at</hi> Black point <hi>under the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and profeſſion of a Miniſter of the Goſpel, and boarded at the houſe of Goodman</hi> Bayly, <hi>and</hi> Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes <hi>Wife obſerved his Converſation to be contrary to his calling, gravely told him his way was contrary to the Goſpel of Chriſt, and deſired him to reform his Life or leave her houſe. So he departed from the houſe, and turned her Enemy, and found an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to do her an injury: and it ſo fell out that Mr.</hi> Jordan <hi>of</hi> Spurwink <hi>had a Cow dyed, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that time Goody</hi> Bayly <hi>had ſaid, ſhe intended ſuch a day to travel to</hi> Caſco-Bay. <hi>Mr.</hi> Thorpe <hi>goes to Mr</hi> Jordans <hi>man or men and ſaith, the Cow was bewitched to death, and if they would lay the carcaſs in a place he ſhould appoint, he would burn it, and bring the Witch: and accordingly the Cow is laid by the path that led from</hi> Black point <hi>to</hi> Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co, <hi>and ſet on fire that day Goody</hi> Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ly <hi>was to travel that way, and ſo ſhe came by while the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſs was in burning, and</hi> Thorpe <hi>had her queſtioned
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:001050_0079_0FAEF48EE45014E0"/>
for a Witch: But Mr.</hi> Jordan <hi>interpoſed in her behalf: and ſaid his Cow dyed by his Servants negligence, and to cover their own fault they were willing to have it imputed to Witchcraft; and Mr.</hi> Thorpe <hi>knew of</hi> Goody Baylyes <hi>intended Journey, and orders my Servants (ſaid he) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my approbation, to burn my Cow in the way where</hi> Bayly <hi>is to come; and ſo unriddled the kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and delivered the innocent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe the caſe where there is no ſuch deceit, and the ſuſpected party comes to it, when ſuch a thing is burned, or ſeems extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily hurt or concerned at ſuch a time, how will this prove the party guilty of the crime, he or ſhe is ſuſpected of? If any way, it muſt (1.) Proceed from ſome natural cauſe, or ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy in nature, between the thing burned, and the Witches Body; but no reaſon can be given of this; for a charm is wrought by the Devils power, and not by any natural power of the Sorcerer, conveying any natural venome from their own body, which by the operation of the fire ſhould revert back into it again, as to its center or fountain. (2) Or from the immediate hand of God, cauſing this effect for diſcovery of the Guilty; which we have no warrant from the Word of God to expect (as was ſaid in another caſe, <hi>Chapt.</hi> 8.) (3) Or by means of the perſon burning the thing, &amp; uſing it as a charm to find out the perſon that laid the inchantment upon the thing burnt;
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:001050_0080_0FAEF48F8EFCC2F0"/>
which if it be affirmed truly, would rather prove the burner the Sorcerer; and ſo tend to clear the ſuſpected. (4.) Or it proceeds from the Compact made between the Devil and the Sorcerer; which if any affirm, I ask how know you there is any ſuch Covenant made? that is firſt to be proved, and then that this is one article in that Covenant, and that the Devil will attend to, and keep his part of the Covenant inviolable. Neither of which can be demonſtrated. (5.) Or this ſuffering is a meer phantaſie, or the free agency of the Devil, who is a lyar from the beginning, and therefore not to be he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Among the Confeſſors, <hi>Anno</hi> 1692. was a Negro Woman, who charged two women to make her a Witch, deſcribing how ſhe ſee her mark in the Devils Book. And ſaid, if ſhe might be permitted, ſhe would fetch the things whereby ſhe tormented the afflicted complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. And accordingly brought an Handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, wherein ſeveral knots were tyed, raggs of Cloth, a piece of Cheeſe and a piece of graſs. And as I was credibly informed, ſome compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her to ſwall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>er fleſh; and one took a piece of her ragg and burnt it in the fire, and one of
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:001050_0081_0FAEF4904AF35C28"/>
the Afflicted that had complained of her, was preſently burned on the hand. Another piece of her rags was put under water, and then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers complainants were choaked, and ſtrived for breath as if under water: And another ran to the River as if ſhe would drown her ſelf. Here note, that the raggs on which, as the Confeſſor ſaid, the Witchcraft was laid, did when put into fire and water, affect the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſuppoſed to be thereby bewitched more than the Charmer her ſelf. And probably the cauſe may be, that Satan, the Lord permitting him, may inflict his miſchief on the perſon, the Spectators or Actors herein ſuppoſe to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, ſuiting hereby his deſign to mans faith about it. And if ſo, the reaſon why any ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected perſon is hereby concerned is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are guilty, but becauſe they are ſuſpected.</p>
               <p n="15">15. If the above named Signs ſingly taken, are not ſufficient to prove a perſon guilty of this Crime; then when many, or moſt of theſe ſuſpicions above named center upon the ſame perſon, they cannot prove them guilty. Nay, all of them may be fixed upon the ſame perſon, by the wiles of the Devil, and yet the perſon be innocent. For if Satan can aſſume &amp; afflict any one in the ſhape of an innocent, as hath been already proved, he may alſo in ſhape of a Ghoſt of the deceaſed accuſe them, and ſo

               <q>Quae ſingula non proſunt junct a non juvant.</q>
               <p>I find in the tryals and condemnations that have been in <hi>England</hi> &amp; <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſeveral of them have proceeded upon ſundry of theſe ſuſpicions put together; and ſo the total thence ariſing hath amounted to a condemnation.

               <p>But probably it may be ſaid, that the methods which I except againſt have been uſed with good ſucceſs, for by ſuch things Witchcrafts &amp; Witches have been diſcovered, &amp; ſome brought to confeſſion and repentance, and given unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable demonſtrations of the reality of their guilt, and recovery after it out of that ſnare of the Devil and therefore ſuch ways of diſcovery are ſtill to be uſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Let us take it for granted, that theſe means have occaſioned the diſcovery of Witches; yet if any of them a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Many things have been done irregularly which God hath turned to a good event; as the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Jacob</hi> to get the birthright; the Selling of <hi>Joſeph</hi> by his Brethren. Yea, the diabolical divination of <hi>Nebucadnezar. Ezek.</hi> 21.21. <hi>to</hi> 25. <hi>verſ.</hi> proved proſperous to him.

<pb n="83" facs="unknown:001050_0083_0FAEF491CCC6C080"/>
things are to be imitated by us upon hope of the like event to follow.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the diſcovery aboveſaid hath followed upon the uſe and dependance upon the means aboveſaid, it may be ſaid to come from Satan (over-ruled by the Lord to ſubſerve his glorious purpoſes) as the inſtrument of diſcovery, who expoſeth at ſome times his own Vaſſals to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane juſtice, that he may cut them off from the earth: and therefore aſſumes their ſhapes or otherwiſe renders them ſuſpected to their Neighbours upon ſuch kind of preſumptions, as may wrap in the guilty and innocent toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and thereby working upon the erroneous principles of men, doth (as we uſe to ſay, kill two birds with one ſtone,) deliver up his own Servant to ruine, and give occaſion for the condemnation thereby of an innocent perſon. But Satan is not to be truſted when he ſpeaks truth, or doth that which eventually proveth good, becauſe his aim is always to do miſchief thereby. Our Saviour Chriſt would not accept Satans worſhip and teſtimony when he ſpake true. <hi>Mark</hi> 5 6, 7, 8 And <hi>Paul</hi> was grieved in ſpirit when the Devil gave an high teſtimony of him to be the Servant of the moſt high God. <hi>Act.</hi> 16.16, 17, 18.</p>

in that ſhape, to devour Cattle, and his face had ſeveral ſcratches and hurts, which they ſaid were given him by the Dogs that took him for a Wolf, and he confeſt himſelf, that twice a year he was changed from a man to a Wolf. But this change could not be real, but an abuſe of Phantaſie, either from a diſtracting Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly called <hi>Lycanthropia,</hi> whereby he imagined he was transformed into a Wolf. Or elſe, if he were indeed a Wizzard, the Devil caſt him into a profound trance, whereby he imagined he was killing Cattle as a Wolf; while the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief done was other wiſe, and probably by a real Wolf.</p>
               <p>But thoſe that have been obſeſſed have had ſtrange <hi>Extaſies</hi>; as ſome of our afflicted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have had their trance fits; in which they lay long time in a Swound, and when they came out of them declared they had been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to delectable places, and had ſeen glorious ſights of Men and Angels; as is in part declared above, <hi>Chapt.</hi> 5.

As is frequently proved in caſes of Murder, Treaſon, Robbery, Theft <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and why not as well in Witchcraft? <hi>Perkins</hi> makes this only a preſumption. But <hi>Bernard</hi> makes it a convictive evidence, when one or more fellow-Witches, confeſſing their own Witchcraft, and bearing witneſs againſt others; if they can make good the truth of their wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and give ſufficient proof of it: As that they have ſeen them with their Spirits; — or that they have been together in their meetings, and ſuch like.

There were many ſuch inſtances which ſeemed exceeding demonſtrative in that day. Yet upon an after review of the whole theſe confeſſors teſtimony appeareth to be very doubtful, if not utterly falſe. Yet I would not deny all evidence of confeſſors to be rejected: for the caſe may be ſo that perſons may give ſuch infallible ſigns of their own guilt of this, (as well as other crimes) and ſuch tokens of real repentance for the ſame, as may render their teſtimony notwithſtanding their former tranſgreſſion as credible, as the teſtimony of any other confeſſing Malefactor.

               <p n="1">1. Theſe confeſſors by their plauſible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions and accuſations of others begetting cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, have been a great if not the greateſt Engine of Satan to carry on the accuſing and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending of others, until this matter came to ſuch an height, that if it had not been ſtopped might have brought the beſt Chriſtians in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, under the imputation of that abomination, and have involved all in confuſion or blood. The kingdom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Satan being ſo evident in the winding up of that whole contrivance, leads us to ſee his finger in this principal means, for the managment of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some of theſe confeſſors were firſt under diabolical vexations, (as the other afflicted or obſeſſed perſons were) and under thoſe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments did, as they ſay, ſign to a Book preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them, real or imaginary, by which they obtained eaſe of their pains: And then Satan in their ſhapes afflicted others who accuſed them
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:001050_0089_0FAEF4998324A060"/>
until they confeſſed. And after ſuch confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt themſelves, they alſo accuſed others, as being with them, and they were afflicted themſelves, as they had been at the firſt and complained againſt their Neighbours as others did. So that theſe perſons may juſtly be eſteemed <hi>Daimonizomenoi,</hi> under ſome kind of obſeſſion and deluſion of Satan all this time, and ſo their Phantaſies and Sences abuſed by him all the while; Satan ſometimes tearing of them as a devouring Lyon, and at other times beguiling of them, as a Subtil Serpent.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Others that were not ſo afflicted before their Confeſſing, were ſo preſently after it, and ſo may be reckoned in the ſame predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the others.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I am jealous, and I hope with a godly jealouſie, that ſome by theſe their accuſations of others, hoped to gain time, and get favour from the Rulers. And that ſome of the inferiour ſort of people did ill Offices, by promiſing them favour thereby more than they had ground to engage. And that ſome under theſe temptations regarded not as they ſhould what became of others, ſo that they could thereby ſerve their own turns. And I have been credibly informed, that ſome have ſince acknowledged ſo much.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Theſe Confeſſors ſince deny their Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and accuſing of others, or ſay they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member nothing of what they ſaid or did in
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:001050_0090_0FAEF3AAB6565AC8"/>
that day, whether truly or not, will be more manifeſt another day. We may then well queſtion the validity of thoſe Teſtimonies which the Teſtifiers themſelves do not ſtand to juſtify now the ſcean is changed.</p>

But there have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, ſelf-accuſers when diſtracted, demoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acks, Lunatick, under witted, over-watched, and perſons ſurprized upon ſudden fear or hope of favour to be thereby gained. So that we may hope ſome of thoſe at <hi>Salem</hi> belied themſelves.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Thoſe that being grievouſly vexed with the Devil did, and ſaid they well underſtood not what themſelves. As above ſaid.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It's probable, ſome being accuſed, and their own Relations among others, ſuſpecting them, and vehemently urging them to confeſs

               <p>I begin with the Sorcerers or Witches of Egypt, <hi>Exod.</hi> 7.

For that Meſſage which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by evident Miracles, comes from the God of Power and Truth, and therefore ought to be obeyed. <hi>Pharoah</hi> now will try if his Sorcerers cannot do as much as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> that he may invalidate the Miracles of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and it's ſaid, <hi>they did in like manner, Exo.</hi> 7.11, 12, 22. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8.7. <hi>Gnaſhaſhu Chen.</hi> They did ſomewhat like to what <hi>Aaron</hi> had done. If it were by humane power and dexterity only, then it muſt be by bringing Serpents, Blood and Frogs under their garments, or the like, and by ſlight of hand, ſlipping them down before the company with ſuch celerity, that the things firſt preſented, might ſeem to be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into another nature. But that it was not ſo appears,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that they could not be provided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

hand with Serpents, blood and frogs, to preſent before <hi>Pharoah</hi> at thoſe times, becauſe no humane art could tell them before-hand, what Miracles <hi>Aaron</hi> would work, to inable them to ſtock themſelves with ſuch proviſion before hand.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Had they ſo done by meer humane art, there had been no compariſon between the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of <hi>Moſes</hi> and theirs; and ſo no argument to direct whoſe God was to be obeyed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Jehovah, or the Gods of <hi>Egypt.</hi> For <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah</hi> and his Courtiers, yea, and <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo could eaſily diſcover ſuch legerdemain, and indeed it would have rendred the Magicians ridiculous, and <hi>Pharoah</hi> for improving of them. For <hi>Pharoah</hi> was convicted that what <hi>Aaron</hi> did was a reality; <hi>for</hi> Aarons <hi>rod devoured the Magicians rods, and the blood was ſo over all the land of Egypt, that the fiſh died, and the River ſtank, and the Egyptians wanted drink, and the frogs ſo covered the Land of Egypt, that</hi> Pharoah <hi>acknowledged they came by Jehovah. For he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſteth</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Aaron <hi>to intreat Jehovah to take the frogs away,</hi> Chap. 8.8.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If they had only brought Serpents, Frogs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from other places, and thrown them down by jugling ſlight of hand; then when <hi>Aaron</hi> brought lice upon man and beaſt, they could have taken lice alſo, and ſcattered them about; for they tryed by their inchantments to bring forth lice, but could not: and yet lice

were as eaſily, if not more eaſily obtained than frogs and ſerpents, and they were men ſtill, and had their hands and feet to act with now as well as before: But now they are convinced and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="4">4. The Magicians brought frogs up upon the land of <hi>Egypt. ver.</hi> 7 which ſhews they produced frogs in more places than juſt where they ſtood and acted; and therefore did not act meerly by ſlight of hand.</p>
               <p>Hence we may conclude, that the Serpents, Blood, and Frogs the Magicians ſhewed, were effects above mans power, and not by Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah, therefore by the Devil, the God of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Whether the Devil did only delude the ſight, and bewitch the eyes of <hi>Pharoah,</hi> and the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> or make real frogs and ſerpents out of the putrid matter in <hi>Egypt,</hi> or make aerial bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies like them, or that it was the Devils aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſuch like ſhapes, I determine not: But we may obſerve, that here the Devil, and his Magicians went very far, and farther than at other times; for now <hi>Moſes</hi> is at hand to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their deluſions by the power of Jehovah, and to convince beholders, that there is no God of the Heathen, can work like the God of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Yet for a time the true Miracles of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the ſeeming ones of the Magicians ſeem to be pretty much alike. For it's ſaid,

Theſe effects then ſo like to <hi>Moſes</hi> zeal Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, might move the Magicians to try a fourth time if they could not by their inchantments produce lice, but here their power failed. And the true reaſon was, their God was in chains, and the Lord bound him that he ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed no further to delude men by his pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed miraculous power.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. Either they were ſome practices of Witchcraft ſhe uſed, not expreſly mentioned in Scripture; or they were her protecting and providing for, and maintaining of <hi>Baals</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets who were Witches, and her making their cauſe her own; as ſee, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 16.31. <hi>&amp;</hi> 18. 19 <hi>&amp;</hi> 19 1, 2. She ſeems to be guilty of both. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21.25 26. She made the Prophets of <hi>Baal</hi>'s Sin her own. As <hi>David</hi> is ſaid to ſlay <hi>Uriah,</hi> when he did it not in his own perſon; but contrived how it ſhould be done by others. And we may note that one reaſon why the falſe Propheteſs in <hi>Thyaetira</hi> is called <hi>Jezabel,</hi> is, becauſe <hi>ſhe called her ſelf a Propheteſs, and taught the people to eat things ſacrificed to Idols</hi>; which

was thereby to commit Idolatry.

                  </hi> they were a ſort of Prieſts and Prophets of the Heathen Gods, who had a more ſpecial dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and approaches to them, than the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſort of Heathen had, whereby they obtained or at leaſt endeavoured to obtain ſpecial help from thoſe Gods, who were indeed the Devils.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Note,</hi> they were reckoned among the Prieſts &amp; Prophets of thoſe Idol Gods, as 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.2.

and Idols, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 23.5, 10, 24. And when the ten Tribes are condemned for their heatheniſh Idolatries, &amp; Sacrificing their Children through the fire; their divinations and enchantments are reckoned with theſe abominations, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17.10, 11, 12, 16, 17. And the falſe Prophets of the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Chaldea,</hi> though they prophecyed by the true God, yet prophecying falſely, are called <hi>Diviners, Jer.</hi> 29.8, 9. Though they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended a Warrant from Jehovah, becauſe of their likeneſs to the heathen Prophets and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viners.

               <p n="2">2. Hence as Gods people were to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the Lords Prieſts and Prophets, to ſeek and know the mind of God, and to obtain help from him by them, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.20. <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.7. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22.7. So the Devil had his Prieſts and prophets by whom the people did enquire, &amp; to whom they came in difficult caſes, as to the God of <hi>Ekron,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 1.2. So <hi>Pharaoh, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezer, Belſhazer &amp;c.</hi> Send for their wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Sorcerers to conſult with and help in their great caſes; as the Servants of the Lord ſent to their wiſe men, the Prieſts &amp; Prophets of the moſt High God, to conſult with &amp; help in their difficult caſes. <hi>Note,</hi> All the Heathens were worſhippers of the Devil, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.20.

and a Prophet, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 13.22. <hi>with</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Baal</hi> had his prophets four hundred &amp; fifty, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12.22. And the Prophets of <hi>Egypt, Iſa.</hi> 19.3. are called <hi>Charmers, Wizards &amp;c.</hi> to whom they ſought. As among Gods worſhippers all are not Prophets, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.29.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As the gifts and attainments of the Lords Prophets were differing, and ſo their operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.4, 5, 6. So Satan, who is the god of this world, doth act like the moſt high, in diſtributing his gifts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to his devoted Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.

Hath the Lord his Prophets to propheſy of things to come? So Satan hath in ſome degree like them, who ſhall give a ſign or a wonder that ſome times ſhall come to paſs, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.1, 2, 3. Did the Lord reveal himſelf to ſome of his Servants by dreams? So Satan reveals himſelf to ſome of his prophets by dreams at ſome times, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.1. <hi>If there ariſe a prophet or a dreamer of dreames.</hi> So the Sorcerers of the Heathen, <hi>Jer.</hi> 27.9. had their dreams or dreamers. Did the Lord give to ſome the gift of interpretating dreams, as to <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi>? So Satan had his officers that pretended at leaſt a skill to interpret dreams, as <hi>Dan</hi> 2.7. Did the Lord call <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Prieſt to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice his Son <hi>Iſaac, Gen.</hi> 22 2. So Satan had
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:001050_0120_0FAEF3C6985654D8"/>
his Prieſts by whom the Heathen, did Sacrifice their Sons and Daughters to him; and cauſe them to paſs through the fire, <hi>&amp;c. Lev.</hi> 18.21. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106 35, 36, 37, 38 And this may be the reaſon why cauſing Children to paſs through the fire is ſo often in Scripture mentioned with Witches and Witchcraft. Becauſe this was one abominable way whereby the Sorcerers Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed, to their Devil gods, to implore their help. And as the Lord did more freely &amp; familiarly reveal himſelf and his counſel to ſome more than others: As to <hi>Moſes, Exod</hi> 33.11. <hi>To whom the Lord ſpake face to face, as a man ſpeaketh to his friend.</hi> So Satan had ſome of theſe his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted Servants, to whom he was more open &amp; familiar in converſe. And ſuch were thoſe that had a familiar Spirit to appear at their call: as the woman at <hi>Endor,</hi> by her familiar Spirit divining, brings up the counterfeit <hi>Samuel.</hi> And as the people did ſeek unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> &amp; ſuch Prophets of the Lord as had more eſpecial ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the Lord. So the heathen did ſeek unto thoſe that had theſe familiar Spirits, as perſons that had more eſpecial intimacy with their gods than themſelves had.

               <p>And from this intimacy between the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians and their god, and Satan their god, being as it were, at their call or beck; ſhe that had a familiar Spirit is called <hi>Bagnalath Ob,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi>

               <p>And hereupon it is that Writers ſpeak of Witches being in Covenant with Satan, explicit or implicit; becauſe Satan is ſo ready to act at the call of a Witch: as to make or bring frogs real or ſeeming, and other things at the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians of <hi>Egypts</hi> endeavour, and to bring up Gods <hi>Elohim, i. e.</hi> Spirits inviſible, likeneſs or ſhapes out of the earth, at the call of the Witch at <hi>Endor.</hi>

But ſay ſome, what ever Satan is ſaid to do or reveal by a Witch, cannot he do the ſame things without a Witch?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. Satan hath done great things without Witches, as in the afflicting <hi>Job,</hi> and the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, as aboveſaid.</p>

And this may proceed, (1) Partly from the righteous Judgment of God, giving Satan both permiſſion and commiſſion at ſuch times, to do great things in puniſhment to thoſe that ſeek unto him in that way. As when <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab</hi> goes to the Prophets that were not the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of Jehovah or the Lord, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22.7.
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:001050_0124_0FAEF3CBFA15B870"/>
but of the Devil, to enquire, whether he ſhall go to <hi>Ramoth-Gilead</hi>: The Lord gives the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil a commiſſion to deceive <hi>Ahab,</hi> who by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to theſe Prophet went to the Devil, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22.20, 21, 22, 23. <hi>Who will perſwade Ahab? And a Spirit ſaid, I will perſwade him, — I will be a lying Spirit in the mouth of his Prophets.</hi> Now hear Satans commiſſion: <hi>Thou ſhalt perſwade him and prevail alſo: go forth &amp; do ſo.</hi> (2) Satan may in pollicy do many things (the Lord per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting) at the devotion of his Votarys, which he will not do at other times if he could, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hereby he carrys on his deſign of deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Souls; both of his Votarys, and of them that go unto them. For there be many that have ſo much natural Conſcience in them, and ſo much averſation from the Devil, and horror at his preſence, that they will not ſeek immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to the Devil, who yet will be drawn to ſeek unto Wizards, and ſuch as have familiar Spirits, and ſo fall into the Snare of the Devil, to the ruine of their Souls.</p>
               <p>We know Satan is called the God of this World, and by imitating the Lords methods in ſhewing mercy to man, he ſeemed to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then to be like the Moſt High: As <hi>Lucifer</hi> ſaid, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 14.12, 14. Had the Lord his Ark, Temple, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where to give anſwers to his people? So Satan had his Temples and Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and Prieſts, whereby to give anſwers to his Worſhippers, as at <hi>Ekron,</hi> at <hi>Delphos,</hi> and
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:001050_0125_0FAEF3CCF828FBD0"/>
elſewhere; ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 14 13. Did the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire faith in them that came to him? So Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan requires eſpecial faith in them that ſeek to him for help. Doth the Lord hearken to the voice of a man in working wonders? <hi>Joſh.</hi> 10.14. So Satan will hearken to the voice of his Magicians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Doth the Lord require parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular actions to be done by his Servants, when they work wonders in his Name? As <hi>Aaron</hi> muſt caſt down his rod at one time, ſmite the rock with it at another time, ſpeak to the rock at another time. <hi>Elijah</hi> prays at one time on his face between his knees, at another time o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.42. So Satan had his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ceremonies, words and actions to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by thoſe that obtained ſpecial help from him.

And Satan being thus ſerved by them, did alſo ſome things for them, and that not only in way of operation, as for the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians; but alſo to ſome he did reveal truly ſome future events; as appeareth by the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning given, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.1, 2, 3. where it's ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that a Prophet in the name, and by the help of a falſe God, may foretel a Sign that ſhall come to paſs.</p>

For the Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers, <hi>&amp;c</hi> of <hi>Babylon</hi> are called Sorcerers or Witches. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 47.12. Though by their Inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Sorceries they could not profit themſelves. And the Prophets of <hi>Edom,</hi> and other heathens, <hi>Jer.</hi> 27.3, 9. are called Sorcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for prophecying by Satan, though they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecyed falſely. And ſo I conceive the Four hundred and fifty Prophets of <hi>Baal,</hi> did all uſe Sorcery or Inchantments in their invocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Baal,</hi> and uſing actions they eſteemed acceptable to him, that they might procure by him fire from Heaven to conſume their Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, although they could not obtain it. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.22. <hi>to</hi> 30. And ſo juſtly deſerved death by the Law. <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.18. and by the Law. <hi>Exod.</hi> 22 20. For Sacrificing to a falſe God.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee who were the Witches among the Heathen: We may then query, <hi>Who were the Witches among the Iſraelites that were to be put to death?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. Thoſe that having the knowledge of the true God, or at leaſt the means whereby they might know him, did ſo far forſake the true God, as to ſue unto, and depend upon the

Devil, or another God, as the Heathen Prieſts and Prophets that were Sorcerers did. As by having a familiar ſpirit as the Witch at <hi>Endor</hi> had; or by uſing Witchcrafts as <hi>Manaſſeb</hi> did. Theſe as Apoſtates from God, and Votaries of the Devil, were to dye by the Laws <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.18, 20. As is ſaid of <hi>Boals</hi> Prophets. And ſuch if they prophecyed in the name of thoſe falſe Gods (whether the Propheſie were true or falſe,) were to dye by the Law. <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.20. The Prophet that ſhall preſume to ſpeak in the name of other Gods, that Prophet ſhall dye.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thoſe perſons who did prophecy a falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in the name of the Lord; or prophecy in his name when he ſent them not, are called Diviners, though they pretended to ſpeak (not in the name of falſe Gods, but) in the name of the true God; as, <hi>Jer.</hi> 28.8, 9. <hi>Mich.</hi> 3.7. Though they are not indeed called Witches or Sorcerers, but Diviners, which note a crime near to the former. Becauſe they were ſo like unto the Diviners of the Heathen in prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying falſly, and were alike capital offenders by that Law. <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.20, 22. The Prophet which ſhall preſume to ſpeak a word in my name, which I have not commanded him to ſpeak, ſhall dye, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that although they are not called Witches, but Diviners, yet they were to dye by the Law, as well as the other.</p>
               <p>Here then we may obſerve, who is to be, eſteemed a Capital Witch among Chriſtians

               <p>The end of ſuch devoting to another God is for ſome ſuppoſed benefit. As, 1. To get help from him; So <hi>Abaz</hi> ſeems to be a Witch or Sorcerer, in that he ſacrificed to the Gods of <hi>Syria,</hi> that he might obtain help by them. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.3, 23.

               <p n="2">2. Another end in ſeeking help, is thereby to do ſtrange things, as did the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. Another end is for the diſcovery of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets; as above ſhewed, from <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.1, 2, 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 1 <hi>Sam</hi> 28.</p>

Such have an implicit faith that the means uſed, ſhall produce the effect deſired, but conſider not how; and ſo are beguiled by the Serpent that lies in the graſs unſeen.</p>
               <p>I knew a man in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> who profeſſed the art of curing wounds, and ſtenching blood by a form of words. I diſcourſed him about it, and he told me, he had been in the practice of it; and believed it to be the gift of healing given him from God, upon the uſe of ſome Scripture words be uſed, as he had been taught by an Old woman, and had tried it upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; having cut his leg almoſt half through with an Adds, and only bound up the wound
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:001050_0132_0FAEF3D4E29E0B98"/>
with a cloth, and ſaid over the wound thoſe words, and without other means the wound was cured in a few days. I deſired to hear the words, and he related them to me; and I found him almoſt as ignorant in Scriptures, as an Heathen, and found he could not read. Whereupon I informed him that part of his words were Scripture, and part not; and that thoſe words upon which the greateſt ſtreſs was laid in order to the cure, were a perverſe addition to the Scriptures: a meer fiction of mans invention; and declared to him, that if any ſuch healing followed upon ſuch a form of words, it could not come from the efficacy of the words themſelves, or from a divine concurrence working a wonder, becauſe of thoſe words, which were indeed a lye in the additions made; therefore if any vertue were in them, it came by the Devil, and ſo thoſe words a kind of Sorcery. The man hereby ſeemed convinced of his error, and promiſed reformation. I do not believe this man was a Wizard (though in danger of it) becauſe he did it ignorantly in misbelief.</p>
               <p>I fear ſome young perſons through a vain curioſity to know their future condition, have tampered with the Devils tools, ſo far that hereby one door was opened to Satan to play thoſe pranks; <hi>Anno</hi> 1692.

find her future Husbands Calling; till there came up a Coffin, that is, a Spectre in likeneſs of a Coffin.

               <p>Another, I was called to pray with, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſore fits and vexations of Satan.

This iniquity though I take it not to be the Capital crime condemned, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.

And as of old, they had ſeveral names, as Magicians, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So of late times, they have their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral names, and in part ſeveral kinds of skill, or power, as Conjurers, Aſtrologers, Cunning men, Mathematicians, Witches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But all of them if they have their knowledge, or skill, or work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Devil, are in Satans black liſt of Witches. Some ſuch there have been who di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine by repreſenting a perſon, or coffin, or thing ſought after in a looking glaſs, to diſcover to the perſon enquiring ſomewhat ſecret, or future. I have heard ſeveral credible Stories of ſuch Conjurers; and ſhall relate one here that I ſuppoſe was never in Print. An ancient Woman related to me, <hi>That when ſhe was a Maid, ſhe had a curioſity to know who ſhould be her Husband, and was informed of a Doctor that would ſhew Maids their future Husbands in a glaſs: To him therefore ſhe went with her Money in her hand, to know who ſhould be her Husband; and be carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her to a great looking glaſs, where ſhe ſaw a man in his full proportion whom ſhe never ſaw before. And a while after met this man (repreſented in the glaſs) in the street, and having on the ſame
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:001050_0135_0FAEF3D78572DA08"/>
Cloaths he was repreſented with from head to foot; and ſoon after he came a Suitor to her, and ſhe was Married to him, and was her Husband when ſhe made this Relation.</hi> In this relation obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It was no doubt a truth, for ſhe told me this in way of craving my advice, whether ſhe had done well or evil in going to the Dr. and I told her, ſhe did evil in going thereby to the Devil. 2. It was no deluſion of her phantaſie, or affection working toward any perſon; for it was one ſhe never ſaw before, that was now ſhewed unto her. 3. The Dr. could not bring into the glaſs the ſhadow of a man abſent and unknown, by any natural cauſe, or means by him uſed. Therefore it was from the Devil, who raiſed this Spectre in likeneſs of a man then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known. 4. And the Dr. doing this frequently for his Money, muſt know he did it by a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Spirit, and therefore was a Conjurer in ſome league explicite, or implicite with Satan. And I have heard and read of other Stories of this kind very credible, which ſatisfy me, that this was not the only Conjurer in <hi>England.</hi> But it may be queried,</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How could Satan foretel this woman who ſhould be her Husband, it being then a future con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent thing?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> In this caſe, it might be eaſy for Satan to give a very probable conjecture; for the man was a <hi>Newfoundlander</hi> that came to <hi>England</hi> for a Wife, as directed by his friends unto this
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:001050_0136_0FAEF3D8E5EFE618"/>
young woman: And the Devil knew of his coming, he being at that time upon the Sea thitherwards, or newly come on ſhoar; and the Devil knew his errand, and the quality and conditions of both parties (as he is a diſcerning, peircing ſpirit;) and ſo knew it very probable to be a Match. And by this repreſentation in the glaſs impoſeth upon her Superſtitious, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, a kind of belief of a neceſſity to accept him when he came. But in other caſes, its not ſo eaſy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Here then we may enquire, <hi>How can the Devil know things to come? Is not this Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative? Iſa</hi> 41.22, 23.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Its true that the Lord alone knows things to come, ſo that neither man or Angel can know future events, unleſs the Lord make them known, or afford means whereby the creature may attain to know them: <hi>Shew us things to come hereafter, that we may know that ye are Gods. Of that day and bout knoweth no man, no not the Angels of Heaven, Math.</hi> 24.30. <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.8, 4. <hi>None in heaven, or earth, or under the earth, was able to open the book</hi> (ſealed with ſeven ſeals) <hi>and to looſe the ſeales thereof.</hi> Many other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſpeak of our ignorance of things &amp; times to come, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.1. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 8.7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6.12.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Yet God affordeth means whereby men, who are far leſs diſcerning than Spirits, come to know many futurities certainly, and of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers probably to gueſs, ſo as generally or for
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:001050_0137_0FAEF3D948D3B078"/>
the moſt part it proves according to mans fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight. <hi>A wiſe man fore-ſeeth the evil, Prov.</hi> 22.3 <hi>&amp;</hi> 27.12.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By viſions and revelations and ſuch like, ſo God revealed to <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> the conditions of their Poſterity for a great while to come, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.19.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Prophecyes, promiſes &amp; threatnings in Scripture are a ſtanding revelation of futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, in matters religious, civil, political &amp; na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, as the changes of ſeaſons, <hi>&amp;c. Gen</hi> 8.22.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Many things are fore-known by their cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. As that wood thrown into the fire will be burnt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thus many Phyſitians fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee the death of a perſon ſick of an incurable diſeaſe, when neither they nor their relations are ſenſible of it.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Many things are fore known by the uſual ſignes that go before them, which though they are not proper cauſes of the effects following, yet are concurrent with them. <hi>As when the Fig trees branch is tender Summer is nigh, Math.</hi> 24.32. A red skie in the evening is a ſign of a fair morning; and a red skie in the morning lowring of ſoul weather, and ſo it comes to paſs, <hi>Math.</hi> 16.1, 2, 3. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.54, 55, 56.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Some things men foreſee very probable to come to paſs, becauſe themſelves or others have intended and contrived how to bring them to paſs. As <hi>Saul</hi> fore tells to <hi>Jabeſh-Gilead; They ſhall have help to morrow by that time the Sun be

By obſervation &amp; experience of the uſual events of providence, in the way of Gods go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning the world; a wiſe man fore knows probably at leaſt, what will come to paſs under like circumſtances. And among men, one fore ſeeth things to come farther than another; as he excels another in prudence.

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. In all the above mentioned ways, except the firſt, Satan hath the ſame advantage to know future events as man hath; and many advantages above man. (1.) As he is more knowing, wiſe, and of a larger underſtanding than man. (2.) In that as a Spirit, he pierces more into the inſides and ſecrets of perſons, actions and things. He cannot know the heart of man immediately, that is Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.10. Yet ſo far as the heart diſcovers it ſelf by its operations, upon the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, external and internal, and other members of the body, Satan will find it out. (3.) By the ſwiftneſs and multitude of thoſe Legions of unclean Spirits; they are preſent in all Companies, Counſils, Cabals, and affairs of the Children of men, even with the Sons of God when they worſhip God; and with the
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:001050_0139_0FAEF3DAD63BE118"/>
Sons of men in all the compaſs of the earth. <hi>Job</hi> 1.6, 7. (4) They have their experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of five thouſand years ſtanding. (5.) When they intend and contrive any deſign upon the children of men, they a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e not in danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prevented by death (as men often are) for Spirits cannot dye; and ſo more probably foretel the events of their own counſels. And by all the means and advantages above-ſaid, Satan can fore-ſee future contingent events much farther off than man can, and ſo foretell (the Lord ſuffering) a ſign or wonder which ſhall after come to paſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Satan hath alſo the advantage of fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowing, and fore ſhewing future things by ſome way of divine revelation at ſome times, for the puniſhment of men. So God by ſome means (the way whereby to us unknown) lets the Devil know the death of <hi>Saul</hi> and his Sons, and reveal it to <hi>Saul</hi> for his puniſhment in going to ſeek to Satan; and ſo Satan knows the way to deſtroy <hi>Ahab,</hi> and that from God; and contrives a way to bring it about, <hi>viz.</hi> by being <hi>a lying Spirit in the mouth of</hi> Ahabs <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Yea, the Lord ſucceeds the diabolical divinations of the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> to prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſucceſs unto him againſt <hi>Judah,</hi> for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of <hi>Judahs</hi> fins. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 21.18. <hi>to</hi> 25. From this place obſerve, (1.) That the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> intending War againſt <hi>Rabbath</hi> and

                  <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> knew not which to go firſt unto. (2.) Therefore he uſeth divination by arrows, by conſulting an Image or <hi>Teraphim,</hi> and by looking into the liver of ſome beaſts (always uſed by the heathen) ſo that if the divination favour the right hand, he will go firſt to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi>: If the left, to <hi>Rabbah.</hi> (3.) Thoſe divinations had no natural power in them to direct them, but they were means whereby they enquire of their Gods, that is the Devil. (4) The Lord ſo over rules the divination, that is the Devils Oracle by the Image, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that the anſwer ſhall be, <hi>Go to Jeruſalem and proſper</hi>; and accordingly he goes and proſpers. (5.) The Lord grants ſuch ſucceſs (not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing the ſin) unto theſe devilliſh divinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the puniſhment of his apoſtate people. But when ever the Lord pleaſeth, he diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points all the Devils. Ordinances. So that the Devil cannot know, or cannot diſcover to his Vaſſals what ſhall come to paſs. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.25. <hi>He fruſtrateth the tokens of the lyars, and maketh di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viners mad, and maketh their knowledge fooliſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Then Inchantments, Sorceries, Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall not be able to ſave from evil, or to profit, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 47.12, 13, 14.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If all the ways above ſaid ſo fail the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, that he cannot foretel what ſhall be hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he hath an art by the ambiguity of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, to ſalve his credit, be the event which way it will. So 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22.6. He tells <hi>Ahab;

               <p n="2">2. Another ſort of Diviners are they that reveal ſecrets, as where Stollen Goods are hid, or how Perſons and Veſſels do at Sea, or in other Countries, which they pretend to know by the Stars, and Poſitions of the Heavens; but indeed by a familiar ſpirit. Theſe are by way of diſtinction called, Aſtrologers, Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Such, <hi>Iſai</hi> 47.13 are called, <hi>Heberei Shaemajim,</hi> Obſervers of the Heavens, (tranſlated Aſtrologers) And <hi>Hachotſim Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chochabim,</hi> Beholders of the Stars, or Star gaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.

But if it were by pure art, the rules would be as effectual when people come without ſuch a faith, as with it.
<q>I knew a very pious Matron, who when ſhe was young in <hi>England,</hi> had loſt ſome goods, and in her ignorance, went to a cunning man to find them. He told her he could not help her, unleſs ſhe did believe he could. She anſwered, ſhe believed in God, (or hoped in God) he could.

There have been many evils that have befallen man and beaſt, which have been ungroundedly aſcribed to Witchcraft, and ſo to Witches, which proceed from other cauſes: As from natural operations tho' hidden from thoſe that ſo ſuſpect: or from the hand of God immediately, or from the hand of Satan with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the concurrence of man kind; as hath been in part ſhewed already in this enquiry above.

So that whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver opinions <hi>Balaam</hi> might have of plurality of Gods, yet he owns he could not curſe <hi>Iſrael</hi> but by the true God. See <hi>Numb.</hi> 23 1, 3 <hi>with Deut.</hi> 23. 4, 5. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24 9, 10. The Scripture ſhews that <hi>Balaam</hi> ſought not to curſe <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but by the everliving God.

he ſaith, <hi>he cannot go beyond the word of the Lord,</hi> or Jehovah, my God, <hi>to do leſs or more</hi> Where note, that <hi>Balaam</hi> openly profeſſeth to theſe heathen, that Jehovah is his God, and him he will obey, <hi>Numb.</hi> 22.18. And when the Angel of Jehovah oppoſeth him, he ſubmits ſo far to him as to offer, if it diſpleaſed him, he would go back again. And when he comes to ſacrificing, ſtill it is to <hi>Jehovah.</hi> For he ſaid, <hi>Chap</hi> 23 3 after he had offered, Peradventure Jehovah will come &amp; meet me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and where God met him, <hi>He ſaid unto him, i. e.</hi> to Jehovah. <hi>I have offered upon every altar a bullock &amp; a ram,</hi> and this was repeated again, and ſtill <hi>Balaam</hi> went to meet Jehovah, and Jehovah met him once and again, and put a word in his mouth. And <hi>Balaam</hi> ſpake the word Jehovah put into his mouth: and when <hi>Balaam</hi> ſaw it pleaſed Jehovah to bleſs <hi>Iſrael, Chap.</hi> 24. 1 All the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the place ſhew that all his addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were unto the living God, that by him he might procure ſuch a curſe upon <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which might do more againſt <hi>Iſrael</hi> then all the armies of <hi>Balak</hi> could do.</p>
               <p>Q <hi>Why then is</hi> Balaam <hi>called a Soothſayer or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viner, and ſaid to uſe Inchantments? and what are thoſe Enchantments? and why ſo called</hi>?</p>

Thus <hi>Ainſworth in locum</hi>; all his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer altars and ſacrifices were by the art of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment, or obſerving fortunes. But how theſe were inchantments, ſeeing they were not as the heathen inchantments to a falſe God, &amp; that ſacrificing was an Ordinance of God, is a difficulty to underſtand. But I conceive they are ſo called, becauſe <hi>Balaam</hi> did pervert the end and uſe of Gods O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For God had ſaid to him, <hi>Thou ſhalt not curſe the people, for they are bleſſed</hi> Yet<hi>Balaam</hi> by theſe Sacrifices will try to curſe them. So heathen nations are ſaid to do, before they warred againſt any people to endeavour by prayers, ſacrifices and enchantments to turn the favour of God from them. Before the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then <hi>Romans</hi> Beſieged any City, their Prieſts, called out the God, under whoſe tutelage the City was, that he would forſake the people, Temples and holy things, and be Provoſt unto them, and accept of their City, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> vowing to him, if he would ſo do, to honour him with Temples, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And then offered Sacrifices to the Dictator or Emperour, devoted, or curſed the Enemies Cities and Armies, that they might be filled with fear, terror, <hi>&amp;c.

               <p n="1">1. Satan hath power when the Lord permits him, to do miſchief to the bodies and eſtates of mankind, as already proved in the inſtances of <hi>Job</hi> and others.</p>

And if in other things, why not in revenging them upon thoſe they hate, as well as in other matters? As <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſlew their brethren in a rage that reached up to heaven: ſo ſome will purſue their adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries with a rage reaching down to hell. And exceſs of anger gives great advantage to the Devil, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.26, 27. <hi>Let not the Sun go down upon your wrath; neither give place to the Devil.</hi> If ſinful anger gives the Devil a place, how much more ſuch a rage as whereby men go to hell for aid againſt their toes? When men ſeek to Satan for revenge, he will be ready to further them in it; by diſcourſing with them, (as he did with <hi>Eve,</hi> yea with Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Math.</hi> 4.) to ſee what he may gain upon them thereby: or by tempting them to ſacrifice to him, or uſe his ceremonies and ordinances, whereby, Satan is implicitely at leaſt invoked for to do his utmoſt on their behalf. And Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan that promiſed to the ſpotleſs Lamb of God, all the kingdoms of the world, will be ready

to promiſe ſuch miſcreants to revenge them on their adverſaries, or any miſchief they deſire, if they will ſerve him. And at ſome times to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his promiſe if the Lord ſuffer him, as the roaring Lyon that ſeeks to devour: or at leaſt will pretend himſelf author, of the harms the envyed perſon ſuſtaines. But if he cannot, yet be can anſwer ſuch deluded creatures, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they did not obſerve his direction, or that God hath ſet an hedge about the party malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or the like, and ſo keep up his credit ſtill.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Got,</hi> a very credible and pious woman, told me, <hi>That her father Mr.</hi> Palmer <hi>lived nigh a man that acknowledged himſelf to be a Conjurer. On a certain day there came a violent wind upon Mr.</hi> Palmers <hi>houſe, as if it would blow it down: but it only blew down an Elm tree that ſtood in his Court yard. In proceſs of time this Conjurer came to Mr.</hi> Palmer <hi>and confeſſed that he had a grudge againſt him, and thereupon did invocate the Devil to do</hi> Palmer <hi>a miſchief, and he promiſed to blow down</hi> Palmers <hi>houſe; but only blew down the Elm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>As for matters of fact, I muſt refer to hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that ſpeak of <hi>Malefick</hi> Witchcraft, wherein though many things are certain or fabulous,
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:001050_0155_0FAEF3EF39118710"/>
there may be truth in ſome of thoſe relations. And by the above-mentioned, and other ſuch hiſtories, we meet with of that kind, we may gather, That when perſons will ſeek to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil for revenge, he will either do harm to thoſe they hate, or if the Lord inflict by his hand upon ſuch perſons hated by the Conjurers, Satan will perſwade the Conjurer, that he effected it in perſuance of their quarrel. But if the deſired miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief be not effected, the Devil will have a plea to excuſe himſelf. But however they which by themſelves immediately invocate the Devil to help them, to avenge themſelves on thoſe they hate, are hereby <hi>Malefick</hi> Witches, whether they obtain his help or not.</p>

               <p>HAving ſaid thus much to ſhew what the Witches condemned by Scripture are, I ſhall reflect upon ſome aſſertions laid down in a Book diſperſed about <hi>Salem, Anno</hi> 1695. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, <hi>Truth held forth &amp;c.</hi> Publiſhed, by <hi>Thomas Maul, pag.</hi> 221. He ſaith, What is the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, or Hell but nothing? that God never crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, for they were <hi>Non Entity,</hi> a not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is contrary and perfectly oppoſite to Entity and Being: And this might be the Devil that dwelt in <hi>Adam</hi> which ſeduced him, <hi>Pag.</hi> 185. He inſinuates, That if people keep Gods Commands, or are righteous perſons, they
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:001050_0156_0FAEF3EFD59CE5E0"/>
cannot be poſſeſſed or bewitched by the Devil or his Inſtruments; for the cauſe of their being poſſeſſed, or bewitched, hath been through a life of diſobedience to God, <hi>Pag.</hi> 190. Saith, The way to know one that is a Witch from one that is not a Witch, is by that wiſdom, by which the Damoſel, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.16. was known to be a Witch. Unto theſe aſſertions, I anſwer, (1.) By the ſaid <hi>Thomas Maul</hi> &amp; his Wife: For when <hi>B. B.</hi> was upon her Tryal, the ſaid <hi>Mauls</hi> Wife came in and teſtified againſt the ſaid <hi>B.B.</hi> to prove her a Witch, in order to her Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation for Witchcraft: And the ſame day ſaid <hi>B.</hi> was Executed, <hi>T. Maul</hi> ſaid in my hearing, that if he had been deſired to pray with her at her Execution, he would not; for he believed ſhe was guilty of that ſin the Scripture ſaith, we muſt not pray for it; for he believed ſhe was a Witch, and had covenanted with the Devil, &amp; forſaken God; and that was the ſin we ought not to pray for. He ſaid alſo that he could have come in a witneſs againſt her, if he would; &amp; that he believed ſhe had bewitched to death a Child of his. And he believed moſt of thoſe in Priſon were Witches. From hence I gather, that in the year 1692. <hi>T. Maul</hi> did believe the Devil to be an Entity, &amp; that a Witch by him had power to bewitch to death the Child of him that he eſteemed a righteous perſon; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving as others did, ſave that he counted a Witch guilty of the unpardonable ſin. But when
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:001050_0157_0FAEF3F0C5C01F48"/>
others find an error in proceeding too far in theſe matters, he comes to ſee it alſo: And to avoid it, runs into another extream; which I prove by the enſuing Propoſitions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 1. The Devils were once holy Angels, created by God, and ſo Entities. This appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by many Scriptures before mentioned: As by his tempting our Saviour, <hi>Mat</hi> 4. Who had no corrupt quality within him; being the ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Lamb of God; yet him did Satan tempt, <hi>yea take him up into the holy City, &amp; ſet him on the pinacle of the Temple, and into an high mountain, and ſhew him all the Kingdoms of the World, and the glory of them.</hi> Theſe things could not be done by a <hi>Non Ens.</hi> I ſhall add ſome farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation from other places, (1) <hi>Jude</hi> 6. Angels were created by God. The Devils are Angels. (2) They that left their own habitation are En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities. But the Devils left their own habitation: Therefore Entities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (3) They that ſinned, and for their ſin are delive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

circumſtances have to faſten a ſuſpicion upon any for another crime attended with them; <hi>mutatis mutandis.</hi>

               <p>Here it may be enquired, <hi>Whether perſons ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, poſſeſſed, or under bodily torments or vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by Satan, are fit witneſſes</hi>?</p>
               <p>I anſwer in the enſuing Propoſitions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 1. Thoſe whoſe Bodies are ſorely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by the Devil, and yet their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings clear and free, are fit to be Witneſſes as well as others. As was <hi>Job</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who when Satan had ſmitten him with ſore boyls from head to foot, yet was a fit witneſs for God. <hi>Job</hi> 42.7. <hi>Speaking of God the thing that was right.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 2. Some under theſe moleſtations of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan have their underſtandings ſo darkened and phantaſies ſo abuſed, that they are not in their right mind, till delivered from Satan, as was the caſe of the man among the Tombs, <hi>Mark.</hi> 5.2, 3, 15. So the Damoſel, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.16, 17. Though ſhe gave a true teſtimony concerning <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> yet ſhe was no fit witneſs, becauſe ſhe ſpake by the inſtigation of Satan, &amp; not of her own knowledge. So it may be proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably in perſons under the influence of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment, or obſeſſion by Satan, although in a leſſer degree.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 3. Hence it may follow, that a perſon under theſe aſſaults of hell, may be fit for a witneſs at one time, when free from theſe fits, which darken his underſtanding: But not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:001050_0164_0FAEF3F627CEA898"/>
time, <hi>viz.</hi> when the ſences are beclouded by the violence of their fits. Again, they may be fit to teſtifie to ſome things; namely to what they feel and ſuffer upon their own Bodies. But not of what they ſee at ſome diſtance, or about external &amp; remoter objects; becauſe their eyes &amp; phantaſies may be under ſome kind of faſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation (as I may call it) of the Devil; ſo as to miſtake one thing for another.</p>
               <p>Obj <hi>But is it not then according to the principles laid down above, impoſſible to prove any perſon to be a Witch; ſeeing the workings between Satan and them are ſo ſecret? How can they be diſcovered?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Other Malefactors work ſecretly &amp; in the dark, hoping never to be diſcovered. <hi>Job</hi> 24 14, 15, 16, 17. The Murderer, Thief, Adulterer, ſay, no eye ſhall ſee me, &amp; diſguiſe their faces, dig in the dark, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the Lord ſearcheth out ſuch Malefactors, when ſettled on their lees, with his candle of judgment, though they dig deep to hide themſelves from men; yea, &amp; if it were poſſible, from God himſelf. They ſay, <hi>Who ſeeth us? who knoweth us, Zeph.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Iſa</hi> 29.15, 16. Yet the Lord brings all to light before men when he pleaſeth. So the Lord can &amp; doth diſcover Sorcerers Magicians, and all ſorts of Witches, when, and as oft as he pleaſeth; and ſometimes leaves them to diſcover and betray themſelves: And ſometimes over rules their Maſter whom they ſerve, to intrap &amp; deceive them: <hi>Pro.</hi> 26.26. <hi>Whoſe hatred is covered by deceit,

his wickedneſs ſhall be ſhewed before the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</hi> Which is to be underſtood when the Lord pleaſeth to bring to light theſe hidden works of darkneſs.</p>

               <p>I Shall conclude this Diſcourſe with ſome Application of the whole.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We may hence ſee ground to fear, that there hath been a great deal of innocent blood ſhed in the Chriſtian World, by proceeding up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unſafe principles, in condemning perſons for Maleſick Witchcraft.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That there have been great ſinful neglects in ſparing others, who by their divinings about things future, or diſcovering things ſecret, as ſtollen Goods, <hi>&amp;c</hi> or by their informing of perſons and things abſent at a great diſtance, have implored the aſſiſtance of a familiar ſpirit, yet coloured over with ſpecious pretences, and have drawn people to enquire of them: A ſin frequently forbidden in Scripture, as <hi>Lev.</hi> 19 31 <hi>&amp;</hi> 20.6. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.19, 20. and yet let alone, and in many parts of the World, have been counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced in their diabolical skill and profeſſion; becauſe they ſerve the intereſt of thoſe that have a vain curioſity, to pry into things God hath forbidden, and concealed from diſcovery by lawful means. And of others that by their inchantments, have raiſed miſts, ſtrange ſights,
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:001050_0166_0FAEF3F7A99829B0"/>
and the like; to beget admiration, and pleaſe Spectators, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When as theſe divinations and operations are the Witchcraft more condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Scripture than the other.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But to come nigher home, we have cauſe to be humbled for the miſtakes &amp; errors which have been in theſe Colonies, in their Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings againſt perſons for this crime, above four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years ago and downwards, upon inſufficient preſumptions and preſidents of our Nation, whence they came. I do not ſay, that all thoſe were innocent, that ſuffered in thoſe times up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account. But that ſuch grounds were then laid down to proceed upon, which were too ſlender to evidence the crime they were brought to prove; and thereby a foundation laid to lead into error thoſe that came after. May we not ſay in this matter, as it is, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106 6. <hi>We have ſinned with our fathers?</hi> And as, <hi>Lam</hi> 5.7. <hi>Our fathers have ſinned and are not, and we have born their iniquities?</hi> And whether this be not one of the ſins the Lord hath been many years contending with us for, is worthy our ſerious enquiry. If the Lord puniſhed <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> with famine three years for a ſin of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided zeal fourty years before that, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the breach of a Covenant made four hundred years before that: 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.1, 2. Why may not the Lord viſit upon us the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided zeal of our Predeceſſors about Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft above fourty years ago, even when that Generation is gathered to their Fathers.</p>

                  <pb n="167" facs="unknown:001050_0167_0FAEF3F808E7B960"/>4. But I would come yet nearer to our own times, and bewail the errors and miſtakes that have been in the year 1692. In the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding too many we may believe were innocent, and executing of ſome, I fear, not to have been condemned; by following ſuch traditions of our fathers, maxime of the Common Law, &amp;, Preſidents and Principles, which now we may ſee weighed in the balance of the Sanctuary, are found too light. I heartily concur with that direction for our publick prayers, emitted <hi>December</hi> 17. 1696 by our General Aſſembly, in an order for a general <hi>Faſt, viz. That God would ſhew us what we know not, and help us wherein we have done amiſs, to do ſo no more: And eſpecially that whatever miſtakes on either hand, have been fallen into, either by the body of this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or any order of men, referring to the late trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy raiſed among us by Satan and his Inſtruments, through the awful Judgment of God: He would humble us therefore, and pardon all the errors of his Servants &amp; People, that deſire to love his Name, and be attoned to his land.</hi> I am abundantly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfyed that thoſe who were moſt concerned to act and judge in thoſe matters, did not willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depart from the rules of righteouſneſs. But ſuch was the darkneſs of that day, the tortures and lamentations of the afflicted, and the power of former preſidents, that we walked in the clouds, and could not ſee our way. And we have moſt cauſe to be humbled for error on
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:001050_0168_0FAEF3F8DBCC12D8"/>
that hand, which cannot be retrieved. So that we muſt beſeech the Lord, that if any innocent blood hath been ſhed, in the hour of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Lord will not lay it to our charge, but be merciful to his people whom he hath redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.8. And that in the day when he ſhall viſit, he will not viſit this ſin upon our land, but blot it out, and waſh it away with the blood of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I would humbly propoſe whether it be not expedient, that ſome what more ſhould be publickly done then yet hath, for clearing the good name and reputation of ſome that have ſuffered upon this account, againſt whom the evidence of their guilt was more ſlender, and the grounds for charity for them more convincing. And this (in order to our obtaining from the Lord farther reconciliation to our land,) &amp; that none of their ſurviving relations, may ſuffer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach upon that account. I have both read and heard of ſeveral in <hi>England,</hi> that have been executed for Capital crimes, and afterwards up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſence of an error in the proceſs againſt them, have been reſtored in blood and honour by ſome publick act. My Lord <hi>Cook</hi> relates a ſtory. <hi>A man going to correct a Girle his Neice, for ſome offence, in an upper room, the Girle ſtrove to ſave her ſelf till her noſe bled, and wiping it with a chath, threw the bloody cloath out at the window, and cryed Murder; and then ran down ſtaires, got away and bid her ſelf.

to obſerve them. Both theſe ſins have too much increaſed in our Land. (1.) Coveteouſneſs, an inordinate love of the World gave Satan advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage upon us. (2.) Contempt of Gods Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Inſtituted Ordinances. The Errand of our Fathers into this Wilderneſs, was to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to the Lord; that is, to worſhip God in purity of heart and life, and to wait upon the Lord, walking in the faith and order of the Goſpel in Church fellowſhip; that they might enjoy Chriſt in all his Ordinances. But theſe things have been greatly neglected and deſpiſed by many born, or bred up in the Land. We have much forgotten what our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers came into the Wilderneſs to ſee. The ſealing Ordinances of the Covenant of Grace in Church-Communion have been much ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and neglected; and the fury of this Storm raiſed by Satan hath fallen very heavily upon many that lived under theſe neglects. The Lord ſends Evil Angels to awaken and puniſh our negligence: And to my knowledge ſome have been hereby excited to enter into the Chamber of Gods Ordinances, to hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, until the indignation be over paſt.</p>

Had not the Lord made that breach upon them, they had perſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſecurely in their error. So I may ſay in this caſe. In the proſecution of Witchcraft, we ſought not the Lord after the due order; but have proceeded after the methods uſed in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times and other places, until the Lord in this tremendous way made a breach upon us. And hereby we are made ſenſible that the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods formerly uſed are not ſufficient to prove the guilt of ſuch a crime. And this I conceive was one end of the Lords letting Satan looſe to torment and accuſe ſo many; that hereby we may ſearch out the truth more exactly. For had it not been for this dreadful diſpenſation, many would have lived and dyed in that er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, which they are now convinced of.</p>

I would infer, that Satan may be ſuffered ſo to darken the minds of ſome pious Souls, as to cauſe them to deſtroy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by drowning, hanging, or the like. And when he hath ſo far prevailed upon ſome, that formerly lived a Chriſtian life, but were under the prevalency of a diſtracting Melancholy at their latter end: We may have Charity that their Souls are Saved, notwithſtanding the ſad concluſion of their lives. I ſpeak not to excuſe any that having the free uſe of their reaſon willingly deſtroy themſelves, out of pride, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, impatience, <hi>&amp;c.
