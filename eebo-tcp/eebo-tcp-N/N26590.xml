            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE works of the Lord are great, ſought out of all them who have pleaſure therein. How fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and plainly are we enjoined by the voice of Scripture to behold the works of the Lord and conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the operation of his hands—To conſider how Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Wiſdom determines the character and condition of men and the different ages of the world. Our Lord reproved the Jews for not diſcerning the ſigns of the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:035364_0003_1004A13AEA8909C0"/>times. Hence the advice before us. This know alſo that in the laſt days perilous times ſhall come, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>If it was neceſſary for Timothy to know this, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be leſs neceſſary for us to know it, who are ſo much more intereſted in the events of the laſt days than Timothy could be, or any other perſon in that age of the world. Let us then conſider,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What time is here intended by the laſt days:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, <hi>How it appears that the character of men in the laſt days fulfils the prophecy in view.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. What time is here intended by the laſt days.</p>
            <p>The ſcripture mentions, at leaſt, two important pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods by this appellation: The laſt days of the Jews and the laſt days of the Chriſtians. <hi>Gather yourſelves together,</hi> ſaid Jacob to his ſons, <hi>that I may tell you that which ſhall befal you in the laſt days,</hi> i. e. the laſt times of the Jewiſh diſpenſation. <hi>God, who at ſundry times and in divers manners, ſpake in time paſt unto the fathers by the prophets,</hi> ſays Paul, <hi>hath in theſe laſt days ſpoken unto us by his Son.</hi> Here alſo it is plain that the phraſe means <hi>the laſt days of the Jewiſh diſpenſation.</hi> But in our text the phraſe is ſpoken in the future tenſe, and therefore muſt ſignify the laſt days of the Chriſtian diſpenſation. Such are the preſent days. It is allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the moſt excellent commentators, that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is very near when time ſhall be no longer; when the myſtery of God ſhall be finiſhed; when the Millen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium, the third diſpenſation of the goſpel, ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence, and when Chriſt will deſtroy the man of ſin by the brightneſs of his coming; but this will further appear if we conſider,</p>
            <p n="2">II. How it appears that the character of mankind in theſe days fulfils the prophecy in view. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy begins by declaring that perilous times ſhall come, times of great danger. And cannot the friends of religion now ſee the fulfilment? How perilous are the preſent times, with regard to the ſpiritual welfare of mankind! Our father and fathers' fathers never ſaw ſuch a day as this: ſuch a day of deluſion in the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:035364_0004_1004A13C88AD0DD8"/>Chriſtian world. Univerſaliſm, Deiſm and Atheiſm have ſet their mouths againſt the heavens, and laughed at the ſolemn threatenings of Jehovah. They ſay unto the wicked, It ſhall be well with him, and cry, <hi>Peace, peace,</hi> where there is no peace.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle Peter, writing to Chriſtians in general, foretels this our dreadful apoſtaſy: <hi>There were falſe prophets alſo among the people, even as there ſhall be falſe teachers among you, who privily ſhall bring in damnable hereſies, even denying the Lord who bought them, and bring upon themſelves ſwift deſtruction. And many ſhall follow their pernicious ways, by reaſon of whom the way of truth ſhall be evil ſpoken of.</hi> Thoſe among us, who have the proper uſe of their eyes, can clearly ſee the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of thoſe predictions, which tell us that the Chriſtian world, in the laſt days, ſhall be filled with all manner of deluſions, and pernicious, fooliſh errors. Our falſe teachers are now performing the work long ſince aſſigned for them, that the ſcripture may be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled. Some of them have crept into houſes, and led captive ſilly women, laden with ſins, led away with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers luſts. When the infidel falſe teachers in France publiſhed their infamous writings, Mr. Pirie tells us, that the <hi>poiſardes</hi> or fiſh-women of Paris were the firſt objects of their ſeduction; and by their means the whole fabric of Church and State was o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

'He who flattereth his neighbour, ſpreadeth a net for his feet. There is a way which ſeemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof is the way of death.'</p>
            <p>Theſe horrid deluſions are the ſource of horrid im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moralities, which render the times perilous with regard to temporal life, peace and property! <hi>For men ſhall be lovers of their own ſelves,</hi> ſays the text.</p>

               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:035364_0005_1004A13E54669C48"/>
Men were always lovers of their own ſelves, in all ages of the world; but now this evil of evils ſhall greatly prevail. Selfiſhneſs is the eſſence of ſin; the fountain of all immorality; and as ſome wicked men are more ſelfiſh than others, ſo it is not unreaſonable to ſuppoſe that ſome wicked ages of men are more ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh than others. Accordingly the preſent age exhibits abundant ſelfiſhneſs. How many are there among us, ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining public offices, and under ſolemn oaths to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the cauſe of virtue and the authority of the laws, who can trample on both to accompliſh their own ſiniſter purpoſes. Innumerable are the forms in which this baſe principle appears; but I ſhall particularly attend to thoſe which the text preſents to our view.</p>
            <p>To ſhew how ſelf-love ſhould operate in the laſt days, the text declares that men ſhall be <hi>covetous, boaſters, proud, blaſphemers.</hi> Covetouſneſs now appears every where among all ranks of people, each one looking for gain from his quarter. Such horrid robbery and extenſive violation of property have lately afflicted the earth and the ſea, as were ſeldom known in former times.</p>
            <p>And what age of the world ever heard ſuch boaſting as the preſent? What great ſwelling words of vanity do we hear from the lips of our infidel ſons of liberty! What a treat Patriot was Robeſpiere in profeſſion, ready to die for his country and the cauſe of virtue! and was there ever a greater Tyrant? I ſhall plant the tree of liberty in London next ſummer, ſaid Dumourier. Theſe are but two, among innumerable inſtances of this kind, which may be quoted from the hiſtory of the preſent times. The rulers of France have undertook to regenerate the world, and diffuſe liberty, peace and happineſs every where; and more ſwelling language never was heard from the tongue of man than has proceeded from the leading part of that infidel aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, reſpecting the great good which the world are to receive by their means. The eloquent Abbe Maury, ſpeaking of the great and dreadful change of <hi>times and

               </note> And what high, pompous proſeſſions of patriotiſm and philanthropy, bubble forth in the gazettes, from one year to another. Theſe we know are the effects of pride; for men ſhall be <hi>proud</hi> in the laſt days. Who more proud than he who is wife in his own conceit? and who more wife in his own conceit than he who is wife above what is written, as all our inſidels are, while they ridicule every doctrine, every propoſition, which a creature of yeſterday, a vile worm of the duſt cannot comprehend. Accordingly they ſet their mouth in blaſphemy againſt the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth: For men ſhall be <hi>blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,</hi> ſays the text. Never before was there ſo much blaſphemy known among mankind as ſounds in the world at this day. 'We have no other religion but the Conſtitution, and no other God but Liberty;' ſaid the infamous Marat, when the petition of the Baptiſts in France to be releaſed from bearing arms was rejected. The impious Cerutideclared in his expiring moments that the only thing which was matter of regret with him in leaving the world was, that he left a religion on the earth.</p>
            <p>Blaſphemous catechiſms have been publiſhed in France, in which the Conſtitution of the Republic was ſubſtituted for God, and the National Aſſembly for the Saints. Our Saviour's incarnation has been the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

            <p>The horrid Maſſacre at Lyons in the year 1793 was introduced by a proceſſion, which ſet Heaven and an hereafter at deſiance. An aſs was dreſſed in the veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Prieſts, with the Old and New Teſtament tied to his tail, and made to drink out of the ſacramental cup: and, when the proceſſion had arrived to a certain ſpot of ground prepared for the purpoſe, the Bible was publickly burnt amid the ſhouts and rejoicings of the blaſphemous aſſiſtants. The impious courtezan of Hebert at Paris was on a certain public occaſion bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly dreſſed, placed on a throne of ivory, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped as the <hi>goddeſs of Reaſon;</hi> all with a view to caſt contempt on the worſhip of JEHOVAH.

            <p>But to proceed,</p>
            <p>Another evil here predicted is diſobedience to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. How viſible is the difference between family government fifty years ſince, and that which appears at the preſent time! There was ſuch a thing as family prayer in former times; it was nothing wonderful for a child to hear his father pray and give religious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; but now family worſhip and government are generally neglected, and diſobedience in children is the natural conſequence. The preſent age is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with great light, abundant knowledge, impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant privileges; but ah! the ingratitude every where manifeſt! how great their damnation with whom ſuch bleſſings remain unſanctified! But the text muſt be fulfilled, <hi>Unthankful, unholy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next prediction demands particular notice: <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out natural affection.</hi> The prevalence of this evil is now clear to every diſcerning eye. Kinſmen were more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:035364_0008_1004A1481B7CF108"/>formerly than brethren are at preſent; I think any perſon may be challenged to find in the whole hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of mankind ſo many inſtances of this depravity, in ſo ſhort a period, as have diſgraced human nature within the laſt ten years. What perſon, poſſeſſed of natural affection, could murder his whole family at once, as that infidel<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr BEABLE, of Weathersfield.</note> did in Connecticut? A ſimilar ſpecies of murder was lately attempted in the State of Vermont, by another Deiſt. For more inſtances of this kind, look into France, where infidelity reigns triumphant. There hundreds of fathers and mothers have been lately led to priſon, and publickly accuſed by their own chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that they might be put to death, for ſome differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of ſentiment in politics or religion. Our Lord has foretold this as one ſign of his ſecond coming— 'Children ſhall riſe up againſt their parents, and cauſe them to be put to death.'</p>
            <p>Montſoy tells us, that a certain child, about ten years old, having been corrected by his mother for ſome fault, repaired to the revolutionary tribunal, and accuſed her of favouring the Chriſtian Religion. The accuſation was admitted, the boy recompenſed, and the mother executed in a few hours. One Philippe, in Paris, cut off the heads of his father and mother, while they were aſleep, and carried them to the Jacobin Club, as a proof of his patriotiſm. One Goutin, of Nantz, beat his father on his death bed. Many chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, in that infidel country, have been known not only to deſpiſe and ridicule their parents, but to beat and lacerate them in a cruel manner, becauſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed the precepts of the new infidel ſyſtem of politics. The ſame want of natural affection has been expreſſed againſt other relatives. The Abbé Barruel, in his Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the French Clergy, mentions a father who led his ſon to death; of one O'Sullivan, who led his brother to the guillotine, after he had caſt himſelf into his arms for protection. And we know that a brother of the late King of France was one of thoſe who ſought his deſtruction.</p>

            <p>Another character of men which the text mentions are, <hi>truce breakers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The word <hi>truce,</hi> here means any ſtipulation, cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enant, or agreement, which two or more perſons may form with each other. Look now through the land and through the world: do we not find that truces, ſtipulations, oaths and promiſes are violated every where? The merchant can tell you how few there are at this day, whoſe words are more than wind. I do not believe that there was ever a time in which cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enants, oaths and promiſes were more impudently vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olated than they are at this day. Are not thouſands of oaths broken in America and England annually? Some late French publications inform us, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituent aſſembly of France broke their oaths and promiſes in the moſt public manner. The deputies were all furniſhed with written inſtructions, in which they were poſitively enjoined to make no innovations as to the form of government; yet they framed a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, by which the government was totally chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. So every individual of the convention in the year 1792, took an oath to maintain the authority of the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:035364_0010_1004A14E4A69AA28"/>king. What was the conſequence? In a few months after, they declared France a republic, and murdered the king. And it would be tedious to enumerate the inſtances of perfidy which the French have exhibited towards the numerous towns in Europe, which have fallen within the graſp of their inſatiable rapacity.</p>
            <p>But why ſhould oaths and promiſes be leſs regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed now than formerly? The anſwer is eaſy: The preſent age is the age of <hi>reaſon,</hi> the age of infidelity. Only believe that there is no future miſery, no Bible, or no God, and what need you care for oaths or prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſes? For the ſame reaſon, <hi>falſe accuſers</hi> are multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the <hi>incontinent, levers of pleaſures more than lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of God.</hi> Here is the figure <hi>meioſis;</hi> q. d. <hi>They ſhall wallow in carnal pleaſures, and be filled with enmity againſt God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is impoſſible for any diſcerning perſon, who has lived forty years, not to perceive how much more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous intemperate and laſcivious perſons now are, than formerly, in proportion to the number of people; ruining property, family, body, ſoul and all forever.</p>
            <p>Another characteriſtic of the laſt days is expreſſed by the word <hi>fierce:</hi> What terrible fierceneſs has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the conduct of our infidel ſons of liberty, in promoting the cauſe of their licentious politics! It would be tedious to enumerate, and horrible to deſcribe the cruelties, the aſſaſſinations and maſſacres in France and other parts of Europe, by which the ſavage ferocity of theſe wicked men has been diverted and delighted. In the term of three years, Mr. Harper tells us, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe ſlain in the war, no leſs than three millions of perſons were deſtroyed in France; of which there were two hundred and fifty thouſand women, and two hundred and thirty thouſand children.<note n="*" place="bottom">My authorities are not particularly quoted; for they are not with me.

Little do they conſider what they are doing; how much they help the devil; what aſſiſtance they afford to our modern enemies of all good order, civil and religious.</note> But believe the prophecy, my hearers; the day, the dreadful day, is near, even at the door, when God will teach the world, by an awful leſſon, that our patriotic inſidels are as great enemies to the true welfare of civil ſociety as they are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. For the prophecy before us declares, that men ſhall be <hi>traitors</hi> in the laſt days. The Apoſtle Peter, deſcribing the apoſtaſy of the laſt times, more eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly marks out thoſe for deſtruction who walk in the luſt of uncleanneſs and deſpiſe government. Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous are they, he ſays, ſelf-willed, they are not afraid to ſpeak evil of dignities. He repreſents them as ſpeaking great ſwelling words of vanity, and promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing liberty, while they themſelves are ſervants to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. The ſame are the prophetic ideas of the text: <hi>Traitors, heady, high-minded;</hi> which clearly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignify that men ſhall countenance licentious politics, and be filled with pride and ſelf-importance. They ſhall trample on the laws of men, as well as the laws of God, and oppoſe the beſt principles of government and ſound policy. Accordingly it is impoſſible for
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:035364_0012_1004A15419D60B50"/>any one, who has the proper uſe of his eyes, not to ſee what a traitorous, rebellious ſpirit breathes among mankind at the preſent day. We are a young people, favoured by Infinite Goodneſs with ſome of the beſt conſtitutions of government that any nation ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed; but, young as we are, and happy as we are in this reſpect, we are already diſgraced by three inſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Many there are among us filled with diſguſt againſt the wiſe meaſures and even the foundation of our government. Ungrateful people! we know not our privileges—we cannot enjoy them: ſuch is our unreaſonable jealouſy and diſcontentment: like the man to whom God has given riches, wealth and hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, ſo that he wanteth nothing of all that his ſoul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth, yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof.</p>
            <p>As the minds of men, at this day, are polluted with wicked and licentious principles reſpecting religion, ſo they are with reſpect to politics. The falſe doctrines of <hi>liberty and equality,</hi> which have contaminated mill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions of mankind, have certainly a moſt pernicious influence in ſociety, and are introductory to all thoſe horrid ſcenes of inſurrection and anarchy, diſtreſs of nations and perplexity, which muſt fulfil the prophetic ſcriptures in the laſt days. There are many in our land, who behave as if they eſteemed it their indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable duty to oppoſe government and reproach the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, whenever the mode of adminiſtration happens not to coincide with their political ideas. What violent reproaches and miſrepreſentations have ſome gazettes poured forth againſt the principal rulers of our nation, for that courſe of adminiſtration which demands our warm approbation!</p>
            <p>But what ſaith the ſcripture? 'Thou ſhalt not ſpeak evil of the ruler of thy people. Thou ſhalt not revile the gods, nor curſe the ruler of thy people.' When the Roman officer demanded tribute of our Lord and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, did they, like ſome of our great patriots, refuſe or oppoſe the tyranny of the tax? No: 'Leſt we ſhould offend,' ſaid Chriſt to Peter, 'go thou to the ſea and caſt in a hook, and take up the fiſh that cometh up firſt,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:035364_0013_1004A155C33384E0"/>and when thou haſt opened it, thou ſhalt find a piece of money: that take and give unto them, for me and thee.'</p>
            <p>Subjection to the powers that be is enjoined by the Apoſtle upon Chriſtians, as their indiſpenſable duty. Whereby, I think, it is plain, that Chriſtians ſhould never appear the firſt in political revolutions. That mankind every where ſhould enjoy as much liberty as can be conſiſtent with ſalutary government, muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to the feelings of every benevolent mind; but inſurrection is the laſt mode of redreſs that even an oppreſſed people ſhould ever contemplate.<note n="*" place="bottom">When our ſtates ſuffered that oppreſſion from Britain which occaſioned the revolution, petition after petition was ſent to the Britiſh court, while we ſuffered injury upon injury, before the ſword was unſheathed on our part Every mild method for obtaining relief was adopted.

                  </gap>cation without repreſentation.</note> We find in the ſcriptures very little which can be conſtrued to favour political rebellion. 'The Moſt High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomſoever he will, and ſetteth up over it the baſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt of men.' So long as the plurality of mankind are exceedingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved and wicked, all governments will be afflicted with wicked men and wicked meaſures, in a leſs or greater degree. The hand of piety <hi>for the moſt part</hi> has not ſwayed the civil ſceptre in time paſt, and we may believe never will, while the preſent diſpenſation of the goſpel remains. To what purpoſe then can it be for Chriſtians to be eager in the buſineſs of revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; to exchange one form of government for anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? ſince <hi>true</hi> Chriſtianity, perhaps, will have no more influence under the latter government than under the former. What great benefit can it be to exchange one mode of tyranny for another, and one mode of perſecution for another? Political revolutions are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently political judgments, their circumſtances and conſequences being far more dreadful than the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which occaſioned them. The ten tribes complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and had reaſon to complain of the tyranny of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoboam. Accordingly they revolted. What did they gain by it? Their hiſtory declares that their character
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:035364_0014_1004A1580146F720"/>was far more abominable, and their condition far more miſerable, than they ever were before.</p>
            <p>How happy were the Chriſtians in their own view in the days of Conſtantine, when the old empire was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. Their proſpect was all tranquillity and peace: Nothing to do now but to baſk in the vernal ſun of their great revolution. But clouds, O how black and diſmal! ſoon obſcured all this glory. They ſoon ſound that their new government was not the kingdom of heaven, but nouriſhed the man of ſin, and more dreadful ſcenes of perſecution and cruelty were now to follow than ever were known before.</p>
            <p>Other revolutions, too numerous to particularize, have been attended with ſimilar conſequences.</p>
            <p>It is a great truth, that ſome forms of government are better calculated to promote the welfare of ſociety than others; but it is not enough that a conſtitution be good: it muſt be in good hands, in the hands, not of Deiſts and Atheiſts, but of thoſe who fear God, and hate covetouſneſs; for 'when the righteous bear rule, the city rejoiceth; when the wicked bear rule, the people mourn.' A good conſtitution in bad hands tends to far greater evils than a bad conſtitution in good hands.</p>
            <p>When therefore a nation are become exceedingly corrupt and degenerate, the mere change of their gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment will accompliſh but a poor purpoſe. There muſt be a change of morals as well as government; otherwiſe their revolution will prove a curſe and not a bleſſing: For ſtill the wicked will bear rule, and ſtill the people will mourn.</p>
            <p>It is, therefore, in ordinary caſes, not only great wickedneſs, but extreme folly, for Chriſtians to ſeek a kingdom in this world by political inſurrection; to ſeek that by inſurrection, which Chriſt has plainly told them they never ſhall obtain by any means whatever. It is the future kingdom of heaven which Chriſtians are to look for: a kingdom, which will very ſoon be eſtabliſhed on the earth: for the Judge ſtands before the door, the Millennium is at hand; and then 'the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:035364_0015_1004A15C1D206008"/>greatneſs of the kingdom under the whole heaven ſhall be given to the people of the ſaints of the Moſt High.' Accordingly we ſind that the firſt diſciples were peaceable citizens: we have no account that either Paul, Peter, James, or John, belonged to any republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can ſociety or Jacobin Club; though they had far more reaſon to complain than any claſs of white people now have, either in America or Britain. They never ſwore hatred to royalty; but 'ſubmit, ſay they, to every or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of man for the Lord's ſake; fear God, honour the KING.'</p>
            <p>If the obſervations now made be juſt, the principles and conduct of multitudes, at this day, are clearly traitor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and amply fulfil this ſolemn prediction of the text.</p>
            <p>But I hear the voice of objection: "What buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs have the miniſters of the goſpel with politicians in their preaching!" The anſwer is, Becauſe politicians have buſineſs with them. The miniſters of religion in France have had buſineſs with infidel politicians, drowning boats and aſſaſſinations, becauſe all theſe have had buſineſs with them. Among the many devices of Satan at the preſent day, this is one, that the teachers of religion have no concern with polities. But had Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and other prophets, no concern in theſe affairs? Had the Apoſtles no concern with them, when they taught ſubjection to rulers? Read your Bibles, and determine. Indiſpenſable is the duty of the watchmen, on the walls of Zion, as they are ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to diſcern the ſigns of the times, to warn the churches and people of their approaching danger.</p>
            <p>But to proceed. While many blaſpheme the Lord of glory, others oppoſe him ſecretly, by the form of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, while they deny the power, ſlumbering on the principles of falſe religion, as on a bed of down; from ſuch, we are exhorted by the text, to turn away, deny ourſelves, and take up the croſs. Gog and Magog ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify <hi>covered and uncovered,</hi> ſecret enemies, and open enemies: theſe are the two grand perſecutors of the church, in the laſt days.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:035364_0016_1004A1606B223898"/>
We now attend to the next prediction. <hi>Ever learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The preſent age exceeds all others for learning; many have run to and fro, and knowledge is increaſed. Yet vaſt multitudes are not only deſtitute of the ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual knowledge of Chriſt; but they wander more and more in the mazes of ſtrong deluſion, that they all might be damned, who believe not the truth, but have pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs. For, ſays the text, 'Evil men and ſeducers wax worſe and worſe, deceiving and being deceived.' For 'as Jannes and Jambres with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood Moſes, ſo do theſe alſo reſiſt the truth; men of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.' Jannes and Jambres endeavoured to repreſent Moſes as an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor: ſo do theſe men alſo reſiſt the truth, endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouring to repreſent all the prophets as impoſtors. 'But they ſhall proceed no further: for their folly ſhall be manifeſt unto all men, as theirs alſo was.' Jannes and Jambres were magi, wiſe men, who became fools, and were ſhewn to be ſuch. And our modern magi are wiſe men, in reality, with regard to the ſciences; but profeſſing themſelves to be wiſe with regard to relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, they become fools; and it will not be long, before God will exhibit them as ſuch to the view of the whole world.</p>
            <p>There were giants in the earth, in thoſe days of wickedneſs which preceded the flood; and there are giants in the earth in theſe days, with reſpect to litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, exerting their wiſdom againſt Heaven. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer were deſtroyed by water, and theſe will be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by fire. 'Be patient, therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord'—'For they ſhall proceed no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.' This is the laſt effort which the man of ſin ſhall exert. He was firſt a Pagan,<note n="*" place="bottom">Antiochus Epiphan.</note> then a Chriſtian, and now this ſon of perdition has become a ſon of <hi>liberty.</hi> And the characteriſtics by which he is known are as viſible now as formerly. He has committed ſacrilege in the temple of God; robbed the churches of their
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:035364_0017_1004A1627186F868"/>ſacred utenſils. He has magnified himſelf above every god, and ſpoken marvellous things againſt the God of gods. He corrupts by flatteries, promiſing liberty. He thinks to change <hi>times and laws.</hi> He is a revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioniſt, with a new calendar and conſtitution. He has not regarded the deſire of 'women;' but his laws and licenſe proſtrate their honour. He has ſeized the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries, and 'divided the land for gain.' Formerly, the man or ſin oppoſed Chriſt under the covering of religion; but now he meets Chriſt in the open field; and Chriſt will ſoon meet him in the open field, and deſtroy him by the brightneſs of his coming.<note n="*" place="bottom">

Joſephus tells us, that the young peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple among them were fond of innovations: that ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilies were greatly divided among themſelves, and the deareſt connexions broke through all reſtraints, with reſpect to each other.</p>
            <p>How remarkable the reſemblance between the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh zealots and the infidel Jacobins of Europe! The zealots were great patriots. "They exhorted one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other to aſſert their liberty," ſays Joſephus. "They trampled on the laws of men, and laughed at the laws of God. They ridiculed the oracles of the prophets, as the tricks of jugglers." "They diſannulled the ſucceſſion of the prieſthood, and ordained vile, ignoble, and undeſerving perſons for that office, that they might have their aſſiſtance in their wicked undertakings." Such has been the conduct of the Jacobins, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the laws of men and the laws of God. The conſcientious Catholic prieſts were driven from their places and livings, and were ſucceeded by licentious and perjured perſons, who favoured the Jacobins, and taught the religion of reaſon.</p>
            <p>The zealots murdered many of the prieſts, and de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtroyed the remains of political government. "They erected tribunals," ſays Joſephus, "for the deſtruction of thoſe who were obnoxious to their n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And while they were deſtroying the people, their terror was ſo great, that no one had cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age enough openly to weep for his deceaſed friend or relation, or to bury him." Juſt like the conduct of the Jacobins, in Robeſpiere's reign of terror; with this difference, that the tyranny and wickedneſs of the latter have been far more extenſive. And as the laſt days of the Jews were more and more perilous, till the time of their deſtruction; ſo we may expect that our days will be more and more perilous, till the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian world are deſtroyed by fire from heaven: Chriſt has expreſsly told us, that there ſhall now be ſuch a time
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:035364_0019_1004A16A6DDEF738"/>of trouble 'as was not from the beginning of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; diſtreſs of nations and perplexity, the ſea and waves roaring, men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after thoſe things which are coming on the earth.' Many will tell you that the coming of Chriſt is far off, and that the Chriſtian world will ſoon be filled with holineſs and happineſs.

Chriſt is the eſſential Word, whence the written word proceeds; oppoſed by the armies of infidels. This word will then be fulfilled in their deſtruction. This fulfilment they will ſee and feel with ineffable anguiſh, and thus be ſlain by the ſword proceeding out of his mouth. Then they will laugh no more, but ſoberly believe that the word of God, fulfilled in their ruin, is quick and powerful, ſharper than any two-edged ſword, piercing even to the dividing aſunder of ſoul and ſpirit, of the joints and marrow.</p>
            <p>Some will tell you there is too much knowledge in the world for the exiſtence of perſecution. But this is a great miſtake. When Chriſt and the firſt diſciples were perſecuted, there was more knowledge both among the Jews and Romans than ever there had been in any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer period. The true ſource of perſecution is neither ignorance nor knowledge, with reſpect to the ſciences; but wickedneſs of heart, joined with ignorance of the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ological truth and the rights of conſcience. The inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent blood in France, which has run in torrents on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of religion as well as politics within ſeven years paſt by means of the men of knowledge, is a glaring evidence that there may be ſuch a creature in the world as a patriotic, perſecuting philoſopher. In that age of the world, which reſembled this, the infidel Romans firſt perſecuted and deſtroyed a perſecuting church, and then turned their fury againſt the ſaints; ſo our mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern infidels are now perſecuting and deſtroying a perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting church.<note n="*" place="bottom">This muſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Then it will be ſound that our calendar, churches, and clergy are attended with loſs to the public—loſs of time and loſs of money —and are utterly inconſiſtent with the wiſeſt political economy. And then the churches, the clergy, and the obſervers of the Sabbath, muſt be puniſhed as enemies to the State. Theſe or ſimilar abominations may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be expected as ſoon as the people ſhall become ſufficiently licentious and degenerate. Such corrupt trees cannot but yield ſuch deadly fruit wherever the ſoil will admit of it. The baſe examples, which ſome

The fault in that caſe is not your own, but his. There is a wide difference, in the ſight of God, between our electing an inſidel whom we eſteem a Chriſtian, and our freely elevating to political authority the known and open enemies of God and of Jeſus Chriſt.

            <p>For the ſame reaſon, it is the indiſpenſable duty of all Chriſtian churches to diſcipline and excommunicate ſuch of their members as obſtinately perſiſt in favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the political elevation of ſuch licentious charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.<note n="*" place="bottom">Have we not obſerved, in our country, the Deiſt favouring ſome Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, and uſing his influence to obtain certain privileges for them?
