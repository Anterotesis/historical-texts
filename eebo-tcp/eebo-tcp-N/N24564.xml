            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>APOLOGY FOR THE POEM.</head>
            <p>I AM aware, it may be objected to the production, which assumes the title of BEACON HILL, that the appellation is not sufficiently appropriate, and that twenty other names would equally apply to those conspicuous features, which the author has attempted to delineate. True—but</p>
            <lg>
               <l>"What's in a name? that, which we call a rose,</l>
               <l>"By any other name would smell as sweet."</l>
            </lg>
            <p>If the performance has merit, the name, as it does not imply an absurdity, will not, it is presumed, create an objection; or if, in concurrence with the fears of its author, the whole be consigned to hopeless oblivion—<hi>By any other name the thing would sink as low.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet, when it is remembered, that the great events, which form the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the piece, originated within the view of this interesting eminence, the mind, by the natural association of ideas, will be easily led to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template every succeeding occurrence of the Revolution.—But enough of <hi>Names</hi>—the motives of my vanity, or the causes of my presumption, in attempting so great a subject, require a more particular apology.</p>
            <p>To gratify a wish, expressed by one, whose injunctions it is my pleasure to regard, I was prevailed on to attempt a short sketch of the delightful views, displayed from this commanding summit: when meeting his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, the judgment of the critic was lost in the partiality of the friend, and he earnestly solicited their enlargement by a general allusion to those great political events, which had their origin, and were essentially matured, in the vicinity of this celebrated spot. Having been himself, at an early pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of life, actively engaged in those important scenes, he now became so
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:032512_0005_0FF3138C04062E90"/>
eloquent in description, and so rich in anecdote, that I could not with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference listen to his request, nor fail to partake of his enthusiasm; and, by the assistance of the best historians of our country, was induced to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list and enlarge, till I was terrified at my own temerity.</p>
            <p>When the season recalled me to the busy world, my poem was relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished, and the appropriate occupations of my sex and station prevented even a thought of its continuance; till restored to my beloved solitude, the same vigilant instructor again awakened my attention. In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner several seasons glided away, till despair of being able any further to correct its errors, and anxiety to be freed from the misery of suspense, has impelled me, "with all its imperfections on its head," and <hi>all my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions on my heart,</hi> to risk its appearance at the tribunal of literary inves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation; yet neither deprecating judgment, nor imploring mercy, but patiently waiting the award of impartial justice.</p>
            <p>Impressed with the idea, that an author should be considered of no sex, and that the individual must be lost in the writer, I solicit unprejudiced crit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icism and invite candid censure; for in presuming to meet the public eye, I am sensible it is necessary to resign all personal considerations, and that neither my avocations nor my incapacity will be suffered to plead for me: but I have dared to hope, that my <hi>verses</hi> alone can receive the general disapprobation, as no party prejudice, no spirit of contention, has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded the exalted theme: to those, whom the annals of their country have mentioned with honor, the <hi>Muse</hi> has given glory; yet has not the limits of the poem permitted the author to bestow on every individual <hi>all</hi> the applause, which his own great actions, on the ample page of history, will more gracefully perpetuate. In situations, where an equality of character was conspicuous, some brilliant event of superior fortune, not personal prepossession, has induced the alternative: nor will, it is anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iously hoped, offence be felt, where only honor was intended.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="ix" facs="unknown:032512_0006_0FF3138E46D8BB38"/>
It has also been the intention of the author tenaciously to preserve a sacred regard for eventful facts, although in some instances she has ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to transpose their period—and if it has appeared poetically essential to vary the chronology, in no instance, to her knowledge, has the integrity of history been violated.</p>
            <p>The apprehensive feelings of the author did not permit her at present to offer more than the first book—what remain are perhaps not more meritorious, and if this fail to please, ruin is alike the portion of them all; but should those, whom I am proud to respect for their judgment, taste and talents, approve the venturous stranger, the succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing numbers will instantly appear; in some of which the author has felt most pleasure in painting the interesting occurrences of individual mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oirs; and the noble enthusiasm of the gallant <hi>FAYETTE,</hi> the heroic and impassioned adventures of Lady <hi>HARRIOT ACKLAND,</hi> the tragic fate of the unfortunate Miss <hi>McCREA,</hi> and the pathetic perils of the young and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished <hi>ASGIL,</hi> &amp;c. will occasionally diversify the scene, and awaken, at least in the female breast, sympathy and condolence. To the tender and feeling bosom of that benevolent sex, let me be permitted to offer one sentence ere I close.</p>
            <p>I know, my fair friends, that with many, who do not write, application to literature in a female is imagined to imply a neglect of appropriate duties. As this idea has originated rather in misapprehension than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity, it may not be improper to observe, that it is only amid the leisure and retirement, to which the sultry season is devoted, that I permit my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to hold converse with the Muses; nor does their enchantment ever allure me from one personal occupation, which my station renders ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatory; but those hours, which might otherwise be lost in dissipation, or sunk in languor, are alone resigned to the unoffending charms of Poetry and Science.</p>
