            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO My Worthy Friend Mr. JOHN EYRE, One of His Majesties Justices of the Peace, at <hi>Boston</hi> in <hi>New-England.</hi>

               <salute>Dear SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE Love which is in the Heart of a Father towards his Children is no small Love: and thence the Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for their Death is no little Sorrow. We see it in <hi>Ephraim,</hi> of whom it is Recorded, that when his Sons were taken away by an Immature Death; <hi>Their Father Mourned many Dayes,</hi> 1 Chron. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.22. An Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Mourning is expressed by that of <hi>Mourning as one that Mourneth for an Only Son.</hi> Zech. 12.10. It is a bitter aggravation of the Death of Children, when there is no ground to believe that they are gone to a better World.
<pb facs="unknown:000799_0003_0FAA516CF3C1E4A8"/>
No doubt, but that was the Reason, why <hi>David</hi> was so much moved when he first heard of the sudden Death of His <hi>Absalom.</hi> 2 Sam. 18.33. <hi>He wept, and as he wept, He thus said, O my Son</hi> Absalom! <hi>my Son, my Son</hi> Absalom, <hi>would God I had Dyed for thee,</hi> O Absalom! <hi>My Son, my Son.</hi> So it does very much alleviate grief, when we can <hi>Mourn not without Hope,</hi> of seeing our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren at the Right hand of Christ in the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection at the Last Day. As for your Son who now is not, I could never observe any thing in him, but what was Laudable; and his Worthy Tutor gives him the like Character. Although Death found him using Recreations (which <hi>Students</hi> need for their Healths sake) they were lawful Recreations. Nor was he willing to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert himself at that time, without a particular permission from his Superiors, as I understand: and therefore let not the Circumstances of his Death make too great an Impression on your Spirit. Had Death found him Sinning, the <hi>Evil whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>l upon him suddenly,</hi> would have been much sadder.</p>
            <p>If you lay this Affliction too deeply to Heart, you will Dishonour God and your self too. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> discovered much Humane Frailty, when he refused to be comforted, and said, <hi>I will go down into the Grave to my Son mourning.</hi> Gen. 37.35. The Jewish Doctors have a saying, <hi>That the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God dwells not in a sad Soul,</hi> which they
<pb facs="unknown:000799_0004_0FAA516DB2C0AD00"/>
confirm by that Instance of <hi>Iacob,</hi> concerning whom they say, that the Spirit of Prophesie withdrew from him all the time of his inordinate grief for his Sons supposed Death. But this is certain, that excess of Worldly Sorrow is an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to the Holy Spirit, as well as Excess in carnal mirth. Nothing has befallen you, but what is common to men, yea, and to the best of men. <hi>Aaron</hi> the Saint of the Lord had two of his Sons taken from him by a sudden &amp; awful Hand of Heaven. This is written that you might have Comfort through the Scriptures, and also that you might Imitate his Example in a submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive frame of Spirit to the Will of God under the like (though not so sadly aggravated) Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation. <hi>Aaron Held his peace.</hi> The Lord help you by his Spirit with the same Grace. Say with <hi>Eli, It is the Lord, let Him do what seemeth Him good</hi>: Say with <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> when He Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived sad tidings concerning his Children, <hi>Good is the Word of the Lord.</hi> Isa 39.8. If in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of your own Son, which is taken from you, God shall give you more of His Son, happy are you. Whether your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>I have Read of an Holy man that haveing lost a Son that was very Dear to him, Retired

himself to pour out his Soul to God, where the Lord met with him: after which he was cheerful; An intimate friend of his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering at it, asked him the reason of his Cheerfulness; To whom he Replyed, <hi>I could be content to Bury a Son every Day, on Condition I might meet with so much of God every day as I have done this day.</hi> Now the Lord give you more of that good part which cannot be taken from you.

            <p>SOLOMON in this Book shews the Vanity and Uncertainty of all humane affairs, and the Misery which does on that account attend men whilst they are on the Earth. He takes notice of many Vanities, one whereof is mentioned in the preceding Verse, namely, That Events &amp; Successes are not alwayes as men Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Second Causes conclude they will be. One would think that the swiftest Runner should come to the End of the Race soonest; &amp; that when there is a battel to be fought, they that have the greatest Number and Strength should win the day; but sometimes it falls out to be quite contrary, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battel to the strong. For which there are two Reasons assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. (1.) The over-ruling Providence of God. <hi>Time and Chance happeneth to them all.</hi> There is nothing that <hi>Chanceth</hi> in respect of God, who
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:000799_0007_0FAA516FE7409580"/>
knoweth and has determined all Events<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but as to man, <hi>Casualties,</hi> Accidents happen which cause things to fall out otherwise then according to probable rational Conjectures would have been; in all which there is a Providence, and sometimes there is a great Providence in a small Accident. (2.) Another Reason is in the words before u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, because <hi>Man kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ws not his Time</hi>: which is not to be understood Universally, as if no man did ever in any thing know what Times should pass over him: but for the most part and in most things they are Ignorant thereof. So then the Doctrine at present before us, is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That for the most part the Miserable Children of Men, know not their Time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are three things for us here briefly to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into. (1.) <hi>What Times they are which Men know not?</hi> (2.) <hi>How it does appear that they are Ignorant thereof.</hi> (3.) The Reason <hi>Why they are kept in Ignorance of their Time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Quest. 1. <hi>What Times are they which men know not?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ans. 1. <hi>Time is sometimes put for the proper sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for Action.</hi> For the fittest season for a man to Effect what he is undertaking. The Seventy Greek Interpreters translate the words <hi>KAIRON AUIOU.</hi> There is a <hi>Season,</hi> a fit Time for men
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:000799_0008_0FAA5170ECE8BC10"/>
to go to work in. If they take hold of that nick of opportunity, they will prosper and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in their Endeavours. It is a great part of wisdom to know that season. Hence it is said, <hi>A wise mans Heart discerneth both Time and Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Eccles. 8.5. but few have that wisdom or knowledge. Therefore it is added in the next verse. <hi>because to every purpose there is Time and Iudgment, therefore the misery of man is great upon him.</hi> The meaning is, because men discern not the proper Time for them to Effect what they purpose, their misery is great. If they would attempt such a thing just at such a Time, they would make themselves and others happy, but missing that Opportunity great misery comes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. So it is as to Civil Affairs very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently. Men discern not the proper only sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for them to obtain what they desire. Yea, and so it is as to Spirituals. Men are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of the proper season wherein they may obtain good for their Souls. There is a price put into their hands to get Wisdom, but they have no heart to know and improve it. There is a day of Grace in which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> men seek to God for mercy they shall find it. Isa. 55.6. <hi>Seek ye the Lord while he may be found.</hi> The most of them that have such a day know it not until their finding Time is past. Thus it was with Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael of old. Jere. 8.7. <hi>The Stork in the heaven knows her appointed Time, the Turtle, and the Crane,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:000799_0009_0FAA51727B4AC5A0"/>
and the Swallow observe the Time of their coming, but my People know not the Iudgment of the Lord.</hi> They discerned not the <hi>Iudgments,</hi> that is the dispensations of God. They had a Summer of prosperity but did not improve it. There was a Winter of Adversity coming on them, but they knew it not, nor did they use the proper only means to prevent it. So the Jews when Christ was amongst them, had a blessed time if they had known it: but they knew not the things of their peace, in the day of their peace; they knew not the Time of their Visitation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>A man knows not what Changes shall attend him whilest in this World.</hi> Changes of Providence are in the Scripture called <hi>Times.</hi> It is said that the Acts of David, and <hi>the Times that went over him,</hi> and over Israel, and over all the Kingdoms of the Countries, were written by <hi>Samuel,</hi> and <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet, and in the Book of <hi>Gad</hi> the <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A man knows not whether he shall see good or evil days for the Time to come: he knoweth what his past days have been; but does not know what they shall be for the time to come. It may be he is now in prosperity: he has Friends, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Relations, which he takes delight in, he has Health, an Estate, and Esteem in the World, he does not know that he shall have any of these
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:000799_0010_0FAA51730B213670"/>
things for the future. Indeed, men in Prosperity are apt to think (as they would have it) that they shall alwayes, or for a long time be so: but very often they find themselves greatly mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken. The Psalmist confesseth that it was so with him. Psal. 30.6, 7. <hi>In my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved, Lord, by thy favour, thou hast made my Mountain to stand strong: thou didst hide thy face and I was troubled.</hi> His Enemies were all subdued: his Mountain, that is his Kingdom, especially his Royal Palace in Mount Sion was become exceeding strong, that now he thought all dangers were over, but <hi>Absaloms</hi> unexpected Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion involved him and the whole Land in Trouble. The good People in <hi>Iosiahs</hi> time pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised themselves great happiness for many a year under the Government of such a King as he was. Lam. 4.20. <hi>Of whom we said under his shadow we shall Live.</hi> But his sudden Death made a sad Change in all the Publick Affairs. A man knows not <hi>what</hi> Afflictions shall come upon him whilest on the earth. This is true concerning particular Persons: they may know in general, that Afflict<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ions shall attend them in an evil Sinful World But what those Afflictions in particular shall be they know not. Thus the Apostle speaks, Act 20.22, 23. <hi>I go bound in Spirit to Ierusalem, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

in general that he should meet with Affliction, but not in special what the Affliction would be. So is it true concerning a People, that they know not what <hi>Times</hi> or <hi>Changes</hi> may pass over them. Little was it thought that whilest <hi>Hoshea</hi> (who was the best of all the Nineteen Kings that had Ruled over the Ten Tribes) was Reigning, a Powerful forreign Enemy should invade the Land and make them all Slaves. Little did the Jews think that when <hi>Iosiah</hi> was but Thirty nine years old, he should dy before that year was out, and they never see good day more after his Death. And as men know not <hi>What</hi> their Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Afflictions must be, so neither <hi>When</hi> they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> come upon them. Whether it will be a long or a short time before those Changes over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them. Mar. 13.35. <hi>You know not when the Master of the House comes, at even, or at mid-night, or at the Cock crowing, or in the morning.</hi> Thus a man knoweth not whether the sharpest Afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions which are reserved for him, shall come upon him in his Youth, or in his middle age, or in his old age; though for the most part mens greatest Afflictions overtake them in their old age. Nor can any man know whether his Afflictons shall be soon over, or continue for a longer time. Indeed, the Lords People knew that their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ity in <hi>Babylon</hi> should last for Seventy years and no longer; but that knowledge was by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation. As for some other Persecutions
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:000799_0012_0FAA5179A86DC310"/>
they knew not how long they would continue. Psal. 74.9. <hi>There is no more a Prophet, neither is there any that knows how long.</hi> Those words seem to respect the Persecution under <hi>Antiochus,</hi> when there was no Prophet.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>A man knows not the Time of his Death</hi>: Often it is so, that when Death falls upon a man, he thinks no more of it, than the Fishes think of the Net before they are Caught in it; or then the Birds think of the Snare before they are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in it, as <hi>Solomon</hi> here speaks. It useth to be said, (and it is a plain, weighty known Truth) that nothing is more certain then that every man shall Dy, and nothing more uncertain than the Time when. Old <hi>Isaac</hi> said<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Gen. 27.2. <hi>Behold, I know not the day of my Death.</hi> Though he Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above twenty years after he spoke those words, he did not know that he should Live a day longer. A man cannot know how long himself or another shall live. It is true that <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi> was ascertained that he should not dy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fifteen years were expired. And the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Ieremy</hi> knew that <hi>Hananiah</hi> should not live a year to an end. Jer. 28.16. <hi>This year thou shalt Dy, because thou hast Taught Rebellion against the Lord.</hi> But these were extraordinary cases. It is not a usual thing for a man to know before-hand how many months or years he shall live in this World: Nor may he desire to know it, but he ought to leave that with God. Although <hi>David</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:000799_0013_0FAA517A6614BBC8"/>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> meaning is, not that he might know just how many dayes he should live, but that he might be made duely sensible of his own frailty and mortality, and lead his life accordingly. Oftentimes Death is nearest to men when they least think of it; especially it is so with ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men: we have an instance of it in <hi>Agag.</hi> He came before <hi>Samuel, delicately, and said, surely the bitterness of death is past.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.32. Little did he think, that within a few hours, he should be cut in pieces. When <hi>Haman</hi> boasted of his being the chief Favourite at Court, and that the Queen had invited no one but the King &amp; him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to a Banquet, he little thought of the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which was then preparing for him. When <hi>Belshazzar</hi> was in the beginning of the night drinking and making merry with his profane Companions, he little thought that he should be a dead man before morning; but <hi>that night was Belshazzar slain. Dan.</hi> 5.30. The Rich Fool in the Gospel dream'd of a long life and merry: He said to his Soul, Eat, Drink and be merry, thou hast Goods laid up for many years. But God said, <hi>This night thy Soul shall be required of thee</hi>: He must appear immediately before the dreadful Tribunal. Luk. 12.20. Thus we see what Time it is which men know not.</p>

               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:000799_0014_0FAA517C343A0E60"/>The second thing to be Enquired into, is, <hi>How it does appear that men know not their Time.</hi>

            <p>Answ. 1 It is evident, <hi>In that all future Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies are known to God only.</hi> Hence C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rist said to the Disciples, <hi>It is not for you to know the Times and the Seasons which the Father has put in his own power. Act</hi> 1.7. Future Times and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent Events, the knowledge &amp; disposal of them has God reserved to himself. There are future things which happen necessarily, that a man may know them long before they come to pass: <hi>God has appointed Lights in the Heaven to be for Signs and Seasons.</hi> Gen. 1.14. These move regularly and unfailably according to that Order which the Creator has established. Therefore a man may know infallibly how many hours or minutes such a day or night will be long before the Time comes: He may know when there will be an <hi>Eclipse</hi> of the Sun or of the Moon, twenty, or an hundred years before it comes to pass: but for Contingent Things, which hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Lord challengeth this as his Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative. The Idols whom the Heathen wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped, could not make known future Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies. Isa 41.22, 23. <hi>Let them shew us what shall happen, or declare us things for to come, shew the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:000799_0015_0FAA517D9F407D00"/>
things that are to come hereafter, that we may know they are Gods.</hi> To do this was past their skill. The Devil knows many future things which men are ignorant of; He could foretel <hi>Sauls</hi> ruin, and <hi>Davids</hi> coming to the Kingdom. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, there are many future Events which he has no knowledge of. Therefore he often deludes those that Enquire of him with deceitful and uncertain Answers. But as for men they are ignorant of future things, which most nearly concern themselves, or their own Families. No man knows so much as who shall be his Heir, or Enjoy the Estate which he has laboured for. Psal. 39.6. <hi>Surely every man walks in a vain shew, he heapeth up riches, and knows not who shall gather them.</hi> He knows not whether one of his Relations, or a meer stranger shall possess that Estate which he has taken so much pains, and disquieted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self so much for the obtaining of it. This medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation made <hi>Solomon</hi> out of Love with this World. He knew as much as any man, and yet he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth that he did not know whether the man that should come after him, and enjoy all that he had Laboured for, would be a wise man or a fool, Eccles. 2.18, 19. And he sayes, <hi>A man knows not that which shall be; for who can tell him when it shall be.</hi> Eccles. 8.7. He knows neither what nor when it shall be. And again he saith, <hi>A man cannot tell what shall be; and what shall be after him who can tell him</hi>! Eccl. 10.14. This is to
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:000799_0016_0FAA517E4124F030"/>
be understood concerning Contingent Events. Such as the particular Afflictions which are to befall a man, or the Time, Place, or manner of his Death.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Times of men are ordered according to the Decree of God.</hi> There is nothing comes to pass in the Earth, but what was first determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by a wise decree in Heaven. Act. 15.18. <hi>Known unto God are all his works from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the World.</hi> God knows what he has to do. The Apostle speaks there concerning the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Gentiles. This did God fore-know and decree from the beginning of the World, yea from all Eternity. The like is to be said con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning every thing which happens in the World. Not a Sparrow falls to the Ground without his Providence, and therefore not without his decree, the one being an Infallible Effect of the other. He has decreed when and where every man that comes into the World shall be Born; and where he shall live, in what Country, and in what Town; yea, and in what House too. Act. 17.26. <hi>He has determined the times before app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Eccl. 3.2. <hi>There is a Time to be Born, and a Time to Dy.</hi> That is to say, a Time decreed and appointed by God when every man shall be born, and when he shall dy. Nor shall any man live a day longer than the Time which the Lord has appointed for him. Job 14.5.
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:000799_0017_0FAA517EFAD537E0"/>

So it is often as to matters wherein the Souls of men are concerned.

               <hi>Inf. II. We may here see the Vanity and Impiety of those Persons who pretend to know their own, or other mens Times.</hi> There are some that will not ingage in a design on such or such dayes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are not (as they speak) <hi>Lucky dayes.</hi> Some (as Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> in his Commentary on the Text before us observes) will not undertake a matter on a <hi>Saturday,</hi> because they say <hi>Saturn</hi> has made that to be an unfortunate Time for Action. There are some wicked <hi>Almanacks,</hi> which tell men that such a day of the Month is a <hi>Lucky Time,</hi> to begin a Journey in: And that some other dayes are <hi>Unlucky</hi> ones. This is that which the Scripture calls <hi>Observing Tines</hi>; and it is a most hainous Sin to do so. The Heathen of old did practise such things. But God in his Word declars them to be <hi>Heathenish Abominations,</hi> and with the highest Severity has cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Isa 47.13, 14. <hi>Let now the Astrologers, the Stargazers, the Monthly Prognosticators stand up and save thee from these things, that shall come upon thee; behold they shall be as Stubble, the fire shall burn them, they shall not deliver themselves from the Power of the flame.</hi> They pretended to know the Fate of Kingdoms, and yet could not tell their own and the Nations ruin before the day that it came upon them all. There are cursed <hi>Fortune tellers,</hi> who pretend to know what shall befal particular persons, how they shall be disposed of; when, and where they shall Dye. It is a sad thing, that ever any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son should dare to do thus in <hi>New England.</hi> Time was, when the Air of <hi>New England</hi> was intollerable to such Vipers. Dreadful guilt is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Souls of them, that have gone to Enquire of such vile Creatures, and so of the Devil by them. That famous Gentlewoman, Mrs. <hi>Honey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> who was a long Time under doleful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions, the first Occasion of her sore Conflicts
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:000799_0024_0FAA518425C87C40"/>
was that she had Enquired of a <hi>Forune teller</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Recovery of a sick Child. Much more is it Evil to be a <hi>Practitioner</hi> in this Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And it deserves to be Lamented with tears of Blood, that ever any one that has had a Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this <hi>Colledge,</hi> should be found in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of those horrid Creatures. A late Writer observes, that persons who consult <hi>Fortune tellers,</hi> or <hi>Iudicial Astrologers,</hi> are many times visited with signal Judgments: And that this was an usual practice in <hi>Iamaico,</hi> a little before the late dreadful <hi>Earthquake</hi> there; and yet those Wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es could not foretel that Earthquake before they were swallowed up alive in it.</p>

We have seen Changes of Government in our Civil State: And some of them very sad ones; when we were delivered into the hands of some that hated us, and when we could call nothing our own, but our Civil Liberties were gone, and our Sacred Liberties in utmost danger of being taken from us also. <hi>Changes and War have been against us.</hi> We had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

the next year is Expired; but God has wayes which we know not of, to prevent what our Sins deserve, and what we may rationally fear. There are awful symptoms upon us: And in special the multiplied sudden Deaths which have been of late. The last week two desirable young Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars were Drowned here in <hi>Cambridge.</hi> The Week before that, seven persons were Drowned in another place, and two the week before that. And do you not hear of a very sad Accident, a young Child eight years old happened to kill his Brother not above two years old; besides some other awful Providences. Is there not a voice of Heaven in these things! The words of Christ should be considered by us. Luk. 13.4, 5. <hi>Those Eighteen on whom the Tower of Siloam sell and slew them, think ye that they were Sinners above all men that dwell in Ierusalem, I tell you nay, but except you repent, you shall likewise perish.</hi> So do you sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that those thirteen persons who have been taken away by sudden strokes within these three weeks last past, were greater Sinne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ear thereof. Let none of you say, we are young, and Death is far from us. Were not they young and as likely to live as any of you, whose sudden Deaths has caused me to Preach this Sermon.</p>
            <p>Consider. 2. <hi>When Time is ended Eternity begins.</hi> Time ends with Death. Then as the Angel sayes concerning the <hi>Fourth Monarchy, Time shall be no longer.</hi> Rev. 10.6. When Time shall be no longer, Eternity begins. After <hi>Dives</hi> was dead and his Soul in Hell, <hi>Abraham</hi> told him, that there was a <hi>great Gulf fixed,</hi> that they that would go from Hell could not do it. Eternity is a great Gulf. When once a mans Soul is out of his body, he is got into a Gulf of Eternity: he is <hi>fixed</hi> where he must be forever. Rocks shall sooner move out of their places, than he shall stir from the place where he is. <hi>If a man dy, shall he live again?</hi> No, he shall never live again in this World as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly. Suppose Death should come upon a man and find him wholly unprepared; i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="32" facs="unknown:000799_0031_0FAA518C6F04E938"/>
Error that were another Case: but this shall never be. Job 7.9, 10. <hi>He that goes down to the Grave, shall come up no more, he shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>w him any more.</hi> Though a man would be willing to give never so much to live again, it shall not be granted to him. I have heard of one that when dying, said, <hi>If I had Ten Thousand Worlds I would give them all that I might live one day longer.</hi> Without doubt it is so, with the Souls in Hell. If they had Ten Thousand Worlds to give, they would gladly part with them all, that they might live but one day longer on the Earth, to Repent and Pray in, and earnestly endeavour that their peace might be made with God through Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>You will say, but <hi>What is to be done by us, that so we may be prepared for Death</hi>?</p>
            <p>Ans. 1. <hi>Let us make sure that Death find us in Christ.</hi> That was <hi>Pauls</hi> great care, that he might be <hi>found in him.</hi> Phil. 3.9. If a man was got into the City of Refuge, the Avenger of blood could not hurt him. Neither can Death hurt that man who is in Christ. There are none of us all, but Death may come suddenly upon us. As Eminent Saints, as ever lived have dyed suddenly: was it not so with <hi>Moses?</hi> was he not well and dead in a Moment of Time, without ever being sick? Have you not known or heard of many Eminent Servants of the Lord
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:000799_0032_0FAA518D260692C8"/>
with whom it has been thus? That Holy Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man, Mr. <hi>Brightman,</hi> was taken with Death as he was Riding in a Coach, having a Greek Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament in his hand, because he would loose no time. Our famous Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> was taken with Death as he was walking in his House, fell down and never spoke a word more. Those Worthy Governours, Mr. <hi>Eaton,</hi> and <hi>Haines</hi> dyed in their sleep. So has it been with many a dear Servant of God, that has gone to Bed well, and dyed in his sleep. So did Mr. <hi>Vines,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Capel,</hi> after they had Preached twice the Lords Day before. And therefore I do not advise you to pray (as some do) that you may not dy suddenly, but to make sure of your being in Christ, and then let Death come never so suddenly, you shall receive no harm by it. There are Angels by you to take care of your Souls. But if Death finds a man out of Christ, wo unto him that ever he was born. What terrible work will Death make with that man? It will tear him in pieces, Body &amp; Soul, and send both to Prison, his Body to the Prison of the Grave, and his Soul to a worse Prison, there to remain in a certain fearful expectation of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of Fiery Indignation at the Great Day.</p>

I am concerned in my Spirit for you. All of you are my Children: And do you think that I can see my Children Drowned, and not be troubled for it?

for Religion and good Literature. I took special notice of him; but could never observe any thing in him, but what was commendable, He was ingenious, and industrious, and I believe truly pious; had he lived, he was like to have been a choice Instrument of Service to the Church of God in his Time. And I am perswaded that his Soul is among the Angels of God. <hi>But if this be done to the green Tree, what shall be done to the Dry?</hi> This fatal blow looks ominously on the poor <hi>Colledge.</hi> Considering some other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances; there is cause to fear l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

you. If you slight and make light of this hand of the Lord, or do not make a due improvement of it, you may fear, that God has not done with you, but that he has more arrows to shoot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst you, that shall suddenly strike some of you ere long. But Oh that the Lord would san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctify what has hapned to awaken you unto seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thoughts about Death and Eternity. Who knows but that God may make these sudden Deaths, an occasion of promoting the Salvation, &amp; Eternal Life of some amongst you. It is related concerning <hi>Waldo,</hi> (He from whom the <hi>Waldenses</hi> have that Name given them) that the occasion of his Conversion was the <hi>Sudden Death</hi> of one of his Companions. The sight of that made him serious. He did not know, but that he might <hi>dy suddenly</hi> too, and that he was therefore concerned to be always fit to dy. So did he turn to the Lord, and became a great Instrument of Glory to God and good to his Church. Oh! that it might be so with you. Wherefore I pray you; yea, and I Charge you in the Name of the Lord; <hi>as my beloved Sons, I warn &amp; charge you,</hi> that every one of you endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour that you may be able to give a good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to three plain, short Questions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let every one of you be able to give a good Answer to this Enquiry: <hi>What am I?</hi> Am I a true Believer, yea or no? Am I a Regenerate Person: it may be I am a Civil, Moral young man, but what's that without Faith and Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration? If any man is in Christ, he is a new
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:000799_0036_0FAA51902B539D20"/>
Creature, Am I so? The Apostle sayes that <hi>in Christ Iesus neither Circumcision availeth any thing, nor Uncircumcision, but a new Creature.</hi> Gal. 6.15. So it is not material to a mans Salvation whether he be a Learned or an Unlearned man, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he is in Christ and a new Creature. Tho' you should attain unto an Hundred Times more Learning than what you have, you may perish Eternally notwithstanding that, if you be not in Christ, or if you are not new Creatures. As <hi>Austin</hi> speaks, <hi>Surgunt indocti et rapiunt Coelum, at nos cum omni doctrina nostra Mergimur in gehennam.</hi> All your Parts and Learning will but aggravate your Misery at last, if you have not Christ and Grace in your Souls. If a man is Cast away with Bags of Gold about him, he will sink the faster and the deeper for it; so they that have Golden parts, but ungodly hearts and lives, will of all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons sink the deepest into Hell. <hi>Grotius,</hi> who was one of the Learndest men that this age has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, professed, that he would willingly part with all his Learning, for the Piety of a poor Godly Country man, who was wont to spend his Time every day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after this manner: Eight hours of the day he followed his Calling with diligence, he allowed himself eight hours for sleep; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eight hours he spent in Reading the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and in Prayer, Meditation &amp; Communion with God. Then let your chief care be about matters wherein your Souls &amp; Eternal Estates are concerned. Let every one of you think often
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:000799_0037_0FAA5190E5D79770"/>
with himself, If I should dy this day, is my Soul safe? He that knows not whether he is in Christ, and as an effect thereof, a Sanctified Person, knows not what will become of his Soul to all Eternity. And how dare any of you live at peradventures about a matter of such Infinite Moment, one day to an end? It is related in the Life of that Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Saint, Mr. <hi>Ignatius Iurdain,</hi> that if he met any Scholar, &amp; such an one especially as applied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the Study of Divinity (as there are some Scores belonging to this <hi>Academy,</hi> who are design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the work of the Ministry) his usual question to such was, <hi>What Evidence have you for Heaven? You Scholars</hi> (said he) <hi>have the best Opportunities of all men for the getting of Assurance: you are still looking into Gods Book, and into other good Books, and should acquaint your selves with your Spiritual Estate toward God.</hi> Truly, it is a sad thing, when <hi>Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars</hi> the design of whose life is to gain knowledge, yet know not what their Spiritual Estate is, or what shall become of their Souls for ever. Why! you cannot know what will become of your Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies for a day; but you may know what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of your Souls throughout an endless Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Rest not then without being able to give a good Answer to that Question. I doubt many of you cannot say more than <hi>Berengiraus</hi> did, (it may be some of you not so much) who when he was dying, thus expressed himself, <hi>I am now going to appear before God the Iudge of all; what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of my Soul, I cannot tell; I have some hopes that
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:000799_0038_0FAA5191A57CF450"/>
I shall be Saved, but I am afraid that I shall be Damned.</hi> Poor man! A sad word for so Learned a Person as he was to go out of the World with.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let every one of you be always able to give a good Answer to this Question, <hi>Where am I?</hi> Have I allowance from God who sees me, to be in this place, and amongst this Company at this Time? Am I in a <hi>Tavern,</hi> or in an <hi>Ale house</hi>? Is that a fit place for a <hi>Scholar</hi> to be in, except there be some special reason to induce &amp; warrant him, since the <hi>Statutes</hi> of this and other Reformed <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities</hi> have prohibited <hi>Students</hi> from being seen in such places? Ought I not at this Time to be in my <hi>Study</hi> rather? What Company am I now Conversing with? Am I willing, that my li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e should be gathered with such Sinners? If Death should come upon us suddenly, am I willing that my Soul should be gathered where theirs must be? When Persons will be Venturing where they have no call, they are oftentimes surprised with Evils, <hi>Like Fishes in an evil net,</hi> which they least thought of. <hi>Tertullian</hi> speaks of a Christian Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that going to a <hi>Stage Play,</hi> an <hi>Evil Spirit,</hi> there took possession of her, who when it was wondered at, that he should get possession of one that was a Christian, said, <hi>I found her in my own ground,</hi> and therefore might well take possession of her. Let not the Devil at any Time find any of you in his ground, or in any other place or Company, but where God in his Word giveth you leave to be.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>ly.</hi> and Finally, be always able to give a good Answer to this Question, <hi>VVhat am I doing?</hi> Is the thing that I am
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:000799_0039_0FAA51936A12EB78"/>
about a Lawful thing? Am I using Recreations for my Health sake? And is it a Lawful Recreation, which no Law neither of God nor man has forbidden? The two young men that were Drowned the other day, Death found them in a Recreation: It's well, it was a Lawful one <hi>Skating</hi> on the Ice is so, if used seasonably &amp; with due discretion and moderation. But how dismal is it when Death shall surprise Persons when they are diverting themselves with <hi>Scandalous Pastimes.</hi> Histories tell us of some who whilest they have been <hi>Playing at Cards,</hi> the Lightning has struck them &amp; they have been found Dead with the Cards in their hands. My dear Children! In the fear of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let it never be so with any of you. Be often putting that Question to your selves, do I spend my Time well? Am I still attending some work either of my particular or my general Calling? Am I diligent in my S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>udy? That was it which your Parents sent you hither for. As <hi>Iunius</hi> his father used to direct Letters to him when in the University, as one that was <hi>Missus ad Studen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dion</hi>? If Death should come Suddenly on me, would it not find me squ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ndring away my precious hours, in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing? Do I Remember that an hours Idleness, is a Sin as well as an hours Drunkenness: I must give an account to Jesus Christ the Son of God concerning every hour of my life. Am I not forgetful of my Duty towards God every day? Do I Read the Scriptures and Pray in Secret constantly? Do I often think how Christ lived in the World, and endeavour to be like Him: Am I always doing the things that please God? Now if you can give a good Answer to these three Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>VVhat am I? VVhere am I? VVhat am I doing</hi>? you need not be afraid of Death, let it come never so suddenly. <hi>Blessed is that Servant,</hi> yea Blessed is that Scholar, <hi>VVhom the Lord at His coming shall find so doing.</hi>
