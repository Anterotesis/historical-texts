            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>No! but there may be two ways of underſtanding them.</p>

               <p>If you can prove that, I ſhall be more ready to believe you obſerve thoſe of the other table, for he who does his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to God will be likely to do his duty to his neighbour alſo.</p>

               <p>Don't triumph quite ſo ſoon maſter Bragwell. Pray is there nothing in the world you prefer to GOD, and thus make an idol of? Do you not love your money or your lands, or your crops, or your cattle, or your own will, and your own way rather better than you love GOD? Do you never think of theſe with more pleaſure than you think of Him, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them more eagerly than your religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous duty?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bragwell.</speaker>
               <p>O there's nothing about that in the 20th chapter of Exodus.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Worthy.</speaker>
               <p>But Jeſus Chriſt has ſaid. "He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me." Now it is certainly a man's duty to love his father and mother, nay, it would be wicked not to love them, and yet we muſt not love even theſe more than our Creator and our Saviour. Well, I think on this principle, your heart pleads guilty to the breach of the firſt and ſecond commandments, let us proceed to the third.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bragwell.</speaker>
               <p>This is about ſwearing, is it not!</p>

Mr. Worthy, who had obſerved Brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well guilty of much profaneneſs in uſing the name of his maker, (though all ſuch offenſive words have been avoided in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this hiſtory) now told him that he had been waiting the whole day for an opportunity to reprove him, for his fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent breach of the third commandment.</p>
               <p>Good L—d, I break the third command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſaid Bragwell, no indeed hardly ever. I once uſed to ſwear a little to be ſure, but I vow to G—d I never do it now except now and then, when I happen to be in a paſſion: and in ſuch a caſe, why good G—d, you know the ſin is with thoſe who provoke me and not with me, but, upon my ſoul, I don't think I have ſworn an oath theſe three months; no not I faith, as I hope to be ſaved.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Worthy.</speaker>
               <p>And yet you have broken this holy law no leſs than five or ſix times in the laſt ſpeech you have made.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bragwell.</speaker>
               <p>Lord bleſs me. Sure you miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take. Good heavens, Mr. Worthy, I call G—d to witneſs I have neither cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Worthy.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. Bragwell this is the way in which many who call themſelves very good ſort of people deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. What is it no profanation of the name of God to uſe it lightly, irreverently and familiarly as you have done? Our Saviour has not only told us not to ſwear by the immediate name of God, but he has ſaid, ſwear not at all, neither by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven nor by the earth, and in order to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent our inventing any other irreligious exclamations or expreſſions, he has even added, but let your communication be yea, yea, and nay, nay, for whatſoever is more than this ſimple affirmation and denial cometh of evil.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bragwell.</speaker>
               <p>Well, well, I muſt take a little more care I believe, I vow to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven I did not know there had been ſo much harm in it, but my daughters ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſpeak without uſing ſome of theſe words, and yet they wanted to make me believe the other day that it was mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous vulgar to ſwear.</p>

               <p>Women, even gentlewomen, who ought to correct this evil habit in their fathers, and huſbands, and children, are too apt to encourage it by their own practice. And indeed they betray the profaneneſs of their own minds alſo by it, for none who truly venerate the holy name of God, can either profane it in this manner themſelves, or hear others do ſo without being exceedingly pained at it.</p>

               <speaker>Bragwell</speaker>
               <p>Well, ſince you are ſo hard upon me I believe I muſt e'en give up this point—ſo let us paſs on to the next, and here I tread upon ſure ground, for as ſharp as you are upon me, you can't accuſe me of being a ſabbath-breaker, ſince I go to church every Sunday of my life unleſs on ſome very extraordinary oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>

               <p>For thoſe occaſions the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel allows, by ſaying, "the ſabbath was made for man and not man for the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath." Our own ſickneſs or attending on the ſickneſs of others are lawful impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments.</p>

               <speaker>Bragwell.</speaker>
               <p>Why as to that to be ſure we do contrive to have ſomething a little nicer than common for dinner on a Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day; in conſequence of which one eats you know a little more than ordinary; and having nothing to do on that day, one has more leiſure to take a cheerful glaſs; and all theſe things will make one a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle heavy you know.</p>

My daughters are glad to get out at any rate, and as to my wife, ſhe ſays, that being ready dreſſed it is a pity to loſe the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, beſides it ſaves her time on a week day; ſo then you ſee I have it all my own way, and when I have got rid of the ladies, who are ready to faint at the ſmell of tobacco, I can venture to ſmoak a pipe and drink a ſober glaſs of punch with half a dozen friends.</p>

               <p>That is juſt as it happens, ſometimes I read the newſpaper; and as one is generally moſt tired on the days one does nothing, I go to-bed earlier than on other days, that I may be more fit to get up to my buſineſs the next morning.</p>

               <p>O if you mean my turning off my nephew Tom, the plowboy, you muſt not blame me for that, it was all my wife's fault.

               <p>Which was a freſh breach of the commandment, a worthy nephew turned out of doors, and a wife not ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to for a week, are no very convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing proofs of your obſervance of the fifth commandment.</p>

               <speaker>Worthy.</speaker>
               <p>Very well! only bear in mind that you wilfully break this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, whether you abuſe your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, are angry at your wife, watch for a moment to revenge an injury on your neighbour, or even wreak your paſſion on a harmleſs beaſt; for you have then the ſeeds of murder working in your breaſt; and if there were no law, no gibbet to check you, and no fear of diſgrace nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I am not ſure where you would ſtop.</p>

               <speaker>Bragwell.</speaker>
               <p>Why Mr. Worthy you have a ſtrange way of explaining the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, ſo you ſet me down for a murderer merely becauſe I bear hatred to a man who has done me a hurt, and am glad to do him a like injury in my turn.—I am ſure I ſhould want ſpirit if I did not.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Worthy.</speaker>
               <p>I go by the ſcripture rule, which ſays, "he that hateth his brother is a murderer," and again "love your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, bleſs them that curſe you, and pray for them that deſpitefully uſe you and perſecute you." Beſides, Mr. Brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well you made it a part of your boaſt that you ſaid the Lord's prayer every day,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037133_0013_100C923891CB3CA0"/>
wherein you pray to God to forgive you your treſpaſſes as you forgive them that treſspaſs againſt you.—If therefore you do not forgive them that treſpaſs againſt you, in that caſe, you pray daily that your own treſpaſſes may never be forgiven.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Bragwell.</speaker>
               <p>Well, come let us make haſte and get through theſe command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The next is, "thou ſhalt not commit adultry," thank God neither I nor my family can be ſaid to break the ſeventh commandment.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Worthy.</speaker>
               <p>Here again, remember how Chriſt himſelf hath ſaid, "whoſo looketh on a woman to luſt after her, hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy committed adultry with her in his heart." Theſe are no far fetched expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of mine. Mr. Bragwell, they are the words of Jeſus Chriſt. I hope you will not charge him with having carried things too far, for if you do, you charge him with being miſtaken in the religion he taught, and this can only be accounted for by ſuppoſing him an impoſtor.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bragwell.</speaker>
               <p>Why upon my word, Mr. Worthy, I dont like theſe ſayings of his, which you quote upon me ſo often, and that is the truth of it, and I can't ſay I feel much diſpoſed to believe them.</p>

               <speaker>Worthy.</speaker>
               <p>I hope you believe in Jeſus Chriſt. I hope you believe that creed of yours, which you alſo boaſted of your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating ſo regularly.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Bragwell.</speaker>

               <speaker>Worthy.</speaker>
               <p>I hope then you will allow, that ſince it is committing adultry to look at a woman with even an irregular thought, it follows from the ſame rule, that all immodeſt dreſs in your daughters, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent jeſts and double meanings in yourſelf, all looſe ſongs or novels, and all diverſions alſo which have a like dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous tendency, are forbidden by the ſeventh commandment; for it is moſt plain from what Chriſt has ſaid, that it takes in not only the act but the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the deſire, the indulged imagination, the act is only the laſt and higheſt degree of any ſin, the topmoſt round as if it were of a ladder, to which all the lower rounds are only as ſo many ſteps and ſtages.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Bragwell.</speaker>
               <p>Strict indeed, Mr. Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, but let us get on to the next, you wont pretend to ſay I <hi>steal.</hi> Mr. Brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well I truſt was never known to rob on the high-way, to break open his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's

               <p>No, nor have you ever been under any temptation to do it, and yet there are a thouſand ways of breaking the eighth commandment beſides actual ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for inſtance, do you never hide the faults of the goods you ſell, and heighten the faults of thoſe you buy? Do you never take advantage of an ignorant dealer, and aſk more for a thing than it is worth? Do you never turn the diſtreſſed circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of a man who has ſomething to ſell, to your own unfair benefit, and thus act as unjuſtly by him as if you had ſtolen? Do you never cut off a ſhilling from a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's wages under a pretence which your conſcience can't juſtify? Do you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver paſs off an unſound horſe, for a ſound one?

               <p>You muſt be tried hereafter at the bar of God, and not by a jury of your fellow-creatures; and the ſcriptures are given us, in order to ſhew by what rule we ſhall be judged. How many or how few do as you do, is quite aſide from the queſtion; Jeſus Chriſt hath even told us to ſtrive to enter in at the <hi>strait</hi> gate, ſo that we ought rather to take fright, from our being like the common run of people, than to take comfort from our being ſo.</p>

before a magiſtrate, but do you take equal care not to ſlander or backbite him?

               <p>Yes, I have run the gaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let finely through them all, you will bring me in guilty here I ſuppoſe, for the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of going through with it, for you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn without judge or jury, maſter Worthy.</p>

               <p>The culprit I think has hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto pleaded guilty to the evidence brought againſt him. The tenth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment however, goes to to the root

and principle of evil, it dives to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of things, this command checks the firſt riſing of ſin in the heart, teaches us to ſtrangle it in the birth as it were, before it breaks out in thoſe acts which are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden: as for inſtance, every man co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vets before he proceeds to ſteal, nay ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny covet who dare not ſteal left they ſhould ſuffer for it.</p>

               <p>Why lookee, Mr. Worthy, I don't underſtand theſe new faſhioned explanations; one ſhould not have a grain of ſheer goodneſs left, if every thing one does is to be frittered away at this rate, I am not I own quite ſo good as I thought, but if what you ſay were true, I ſhould be ſo miſerable, I ſhould not know what to do with myſelf. Why, I tell you, all the world may be ſaid to break the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments at this rate.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Worthy.</speaker>
               <p>Very true, all the world, and I myſelf alſo, are but too apt to break them, if not in the letter at leaſt in the ſpirit of them. Why then all the world are (as the ſcripture expreſſes it) "guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty before God." and if guilty they ſhould own they are guilty, and not ſtand up and juſtify themſelves as you do, Mr. Brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:037133_0019_100C92429EF7B818"/>
               <speaker>Bragwell.</speaker>
               <p>Well according to my no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I am a very honeſt man, and honeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is the ſum and ſubſtance of all religion ſay I.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Worthy.</speaker>
               <p>All truth, honeſty, juſtice, order and obedience, grow out of the chriſtian religion. The true chriſtian acts, at all times and on all occaſions, from the pure and ſpiritual principle of love to God; on this principle, he is upright in his dealings, true to his word, kind to the poor, helpful to the oppreſſed. In ſhort, if he truly "loves God," he muſt "do juſtice," and <hi>can't help,</hi> loving mercy. Chriſtianity is an uniform conſiſtent thing. It does not allow us to make up for the breach of one part of GOD's law by our ſtrictneſs in obſerving another. There is no ſponge in one duty, that can wipe out the ſpot of another ſin.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bragwell.</speaker>
               <p>Well, but at this rate, I ſhould be always puzzling and blunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and would never know for certain whether I was right or not, whereas I am now quite ſatisfied with myſelf, and have no doubts to torment me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Worthy.</speaker>
               <p>One way of knowing whether we really deſire to obey the whole law of God is this; when we find we have as great
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:037133_0020_100C924484483CB8"/>
a regard to that part of it, the breach of which does not touch our own intereſt as to that which does. For inſtance, a man robs me; I am in a violent paſſion with him, and when it is ſaid to me, "doeſt thou well to be angry?" I anſwer, "I do well." <hi>Thou shalt not steal</hi> is a law of God, and this fellow hath broken that law. Aye, but ſays conſcience, 'tis <hi>thy own property</hi> which is in queſtion.—He has broken <hi>thy</hi> hedge—he has ſtolen <hi>thy</hi> ſheep—he has taken <hi>thy</hi> purſe. Art thou therefore ſure whether it is his violation of thy property, or of GOD's law which provokes thee? I will put a ſecond caſe—I hear another ſwear moſt grievouſly: or I meet him coming drunk out of an alehouſe; or I find him ſinging a looſe prophane ſong. If I am not as much grieved for this blaſphemer, or this drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, as I was for the robber; if I do not take the ſame pains to bring him to a ſenſe of his ſins which I did to bring the rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to juſtice, "how dwelleth the love of GOD in me?" Is it not clear that I value my own ſheep more than God's commandments? That I prize my purſe more than I love my Maker? In ſhort, whenever I find out that I am more jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:037133_0021_100C92469360EC18"/>

               <p>You muſt confeſs that your ſins <hi>are</hi> ſins. You muſt not merely call them ſins, while you ſee no guilt in them; but you muſt confeſs them ſo as to hate and deteſt them; ſo as to be habitually humbled under the ſenſe of them; ſo as to truſt for ſalvation not in your freedom from them, but in the mercy of a Saviour; and ſo as to make it the chief buſineſs of your life to contend againſt them, and in the main to forſake them. And remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that if you ſeek for a deceitful gaiety, rather than a well grounded cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, if you prefer a falſe ſecurity to final ſafety, and to go away to your cattle and your Farm, and diſmiſs the ſubject from your thoughts leſt it ſhould make you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy; I am not ſure that this ſimple diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe may not appear againſt you at the day of account, as a freſh proof that you

            <p>Mr. Bragwell was more affected than he cared to own. He went to-bed with leſs ſpirits and more humility than uſual. He did not however care to let Mr. Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſee the impreſſion which it had made upon him; but at parting next morning, he ſhook him by the hand more cordially than uſual, and made him promiſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn his viſit in a ſhort time.</p>
            <p>Mr Bragwell when he returned home from his viſit to Mr. Worthy found that he was not quite ſo happy as he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been. The diſcourſes of Mr. Worthy had broken in not a little upon his comfort. And he began to ſuſpect that he was not ſo completely in the right as his vanity had led him to believe. He ſeemed alſo to feel leſs ſatisfaction in the idle gentility of his own daughters, ſince he had been witneſs to the ſimplicity, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, and uſefulneſs of thoſe of Mr. Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy. And he could not help ſeeing that the vulgar violence of his wife did not produce ſo much family happineſs at home, as the humble piety and quiet di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:037133_0023_100C924A69B2E188"/>
of Mrs. Worthy produced in the houſe of his friend.</p>
            <p>Happy would it have been for Mr, Bragwell, if he had followed up thoſe new convictions of his own mind, which would have led him to ſtruggle againſt the power of evil principles in himſelf, and to have controuled the force of evil habits in his family. But his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions were juſt ſtrong enough to make him uneaſy under his errors, without dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him to reform them. The ſlight impreſſion ſoon wore off, and he fell back into his old practices. Still his eſteem for Mr. Worthy was not at all abated by the plain dealing of that honeſt friend. It is true he dreaded his piercing eye. He felt that his example held out a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant reproof to himſelf. Yet ſuch is the force of early affection and rooted rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that he longed to ſee him at his houſe. This deſire, indeed, as is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the caſe, was made up of mixed motives. He wiſhed for the pleaſure of his friend's company; he longed for that favorite triumph of a vulgar mind, an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ſhewing him his riches; and he thought it would raiſe his credit in the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:037133_0024_100C924CE8095FD8"/>
world to have a man of Mr. Worthy's character at his houſe.</p>
            <p>Mr. Bragwell, It is true, ſtill went on with the ſame eagerneſs in gaining mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and the ſame oſtentation in ſpending it. But though he was as covetous as ever, he was not quite ſo ſure that it was right to be ſo. At Chriſtmas, indeed, while he was actually engaged abroad in tranſactions with his dealers, he was not very ſcrupulous about the means by which he <hi>got</hi> his money; and while he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging in feſtivity with his friends at home, he was eaſy enough as to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which he <hi>spent</hi> it. But a man can neither be making bargains nor making feaſts always; there muſt be ſome inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals between theſe two great objects for which worldly men may be ſaid to live; and in ſome of theſe intervals the moſt worldly, form perhaps ſome random plans of amendment. And though many a one may ſay in the fullneſs of enjoyment, "to-morrow ſhall be as this day, and more abundant;" yet hardly any man perhaps allows himſelf to ſay, even in his moſt ſecret moments, "I will <hi>never</hi> retire from buſineſs—I will <hi>never</hi> repent
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:037133_0025_100C924F5111F308"/>
—I will <hi>never</hi> think of death. Eternity ſhall <hi>never</hi> come into my thoughts." The moſt that ſuch a one probably ventures to ſay is, "I need not repent <hi>yet.</hi> I will continue ſuch a ſin a little longer, it will be time enough to think on the next world when I am no longer fit for the buſineſs or the pleaſures of this."</p>
            <p>Such was the caſe with Bragwell. He ſet up in his own mind a general diſtant ſort of reſolution, that <hi>some years hence,</hi> when he ſhould be a <hi>few years older,</hi> and a <hi>few</hi> thouſands richer; when a few more of his <hi>present schemes should be compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> he would then think of altering his courſe of life. He would then certainly ſet about ſpending a religious old age; he would reform ſome practices in his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or perhaps quit buſineſs entirely; he would think about reading good books, and when he had compleated ſuch and ſuch a purchaſe, he would even begin to give ſomething to the poor, but at preſent he really had little to ſpare for charity. The very reaſon why he ſhould have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven more, was juſt the cauſe he aſſigned for not giving at all, namely, the <hi>hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the times.</hi> The true grand ſource
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:037133_0026_100C9250DDA38A28"/>
of charity, ſelf-denial, never came into his head. <hi>Spend less</hi> that you may <hi>save more,</hi> he would have thought a ſhrewd maxim enough. But <hi>spend less</hi> that you may <hi>spare more,</hi> never entered into his book of Proverbs.</p>
            <p>At length the time came when Mr. Worthy had promiſed to return his viſit. It was indeed a little haſtened by notice that Mr. Bragwell would have in the courſe of the week, a piece of land to ſell by auction; and though Mr. Worthy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the price was likely to be above his pocket, yet he knew it was an occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which would be likely to bring the the principle Farmers of that neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood together, ſome of whom he wanted to meet. And it was on this occaſion that Mr. Bragwell prided himſelf, that he ſhould ſhew his neighbours ſo ſenſible a man as his dear friend Mr. Worthy.</p>
            <p>Worthy arrived at his friend's houſe on the Saturday, time enough to ſee the houſe and garden and grounds of Mr. Bragwell by day-light. He ſaw with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for he had a warm and generous heart, thoſe evident ſigns of his friend's
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:037133_0027_100C9252C31FE188"/>
proſperity, but as he was a man of a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber mind, and was a moſt exact dealer in truth, he never allowed his tongue the licence of immodeſt commendation, which he uſed to ſay either ſavoured of flattery or envy. Indeed he never rated mere worldly things ſo highly as to beſtow upon them undue praiſe. His calm ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation ſomewhat diſappointed the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Mr. Bragwell, who could not help ſecretly ſuſpecting that his friend, as good a man as he was, was not quite free from envy. He felt, however, very much inclined to forgive this jealouſy, which he feared the ſight of his ample property, and handſome habitation, muſt naturally awaken in the mind of a man whoſe own poſſeſſions were ſo inferior. He practiſed the uſual trick of ordinary and vulgar minds, that of pretending himſelf to find fault with thoſe things which were particularly deſerving praiſe, when he found Worthy diſpoſed to paſs them over in ſilence.</p>
            <p>When they came in to ſupper, he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to talk of the comforts of Mr. Worthy's <hi>little</hi> parlour, by way of calling his attention to his own large one. He
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:037133_0028_100C9254AB374738"/>
repeated the word <hi>snug,</hi> as applied to every thing at Mr. Worthy's, with the plain deſign to make compariſons favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his own more ample domains. He contrived, as he paſſed by to his chair, by a ſeeming accident, to puſh open the door of a large beaufet in the parlour in which all the finery was moſt oſtentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſet out to view. He proteſted, with a look of ſatisfaction which belied his words; that for his part he did not care a farthing for all this trumpery; and then ſmiling and rubbing his hands, added with an air of no ſmall importance, "what a good thing it is, though for people of ſubſtance, that the tax on plate was taken off. You are a happy man, Mr. Worthy, you do not feel theſe things, tax or no tax it is all the ſame to you." He took care during this ſpeech, by a caſt of his eye, to direct Mr. Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy's attention to a great profuſion of the brighteſt cups, ſalvers, and tankards, and other ſhining ornaments which crowded the beaufet. Mr. Worthy gravely an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, "Mr, Bragwell, it was indeed a tax which could not affect ſo plain a man as myſelf, but as it fell on a mere luxury, and therefore could not hurt the
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:037133_0029_100C9256EF555AF8"/>
poor, I was always ſorry that it could not be made productive enough to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued. A man in my midd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>aded, that new ones are continually brought on to make up the deficiencies of the former."</p>
            <p>During ſupper the young ladies ſat in diſdainful ſilence, not deigning to beſtow the ſmalleſt civility on ſo plain a man as Mr. Worthy. They left the room with their Mamma as ſoon as poſſible, being impatient to get away to ridicule their father's friend.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Dance; or, the Christmas merry-making.</head>
               <p>As ſoon as they were gone, Mr. Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy aſked Bragwell how his family com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts ſtood, and how his daughters, who he ſaid, were really fine young women, went on. "O, as to that," replied Brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:037133_0030_100C92587B45FEF8"/>
"pretty much like other men's handſome daughters, I ſuppoſe, that is worſe and worſe. I really begin to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend that their fantaſtical notions have gained ſuch a head, that after all the money I have ſcraped together, I ſhall never get them well married. Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey has juſt loſt as good an offer as any girl could deſire, young Wilſon, an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt ſubſtantial grazier as any in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. He not only knows every thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for his ſtation, but is pleaſing in his behaviour, and a pretty ſcholar into the bargain; he reads hiſtory books and voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages of a winter's evening to his infirm father, inſtead of going to the card aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in our town; neither likes drinking nor ſporting, and is a ſort of favourite with our parſon, becauſe he takes in the weekly numbers of a fine bible with Cuts, and ſubſcribes to the Sunday School, and makes a fuſs about helping the poor, theſe dear times as they call them. but I think they are good times for <hi>us,</hi> Mr. Worthy. Well, for all this, Betſy only deſpiſed him and laughed at him; but as he is both handſome and rich, I thought ſhe might come round at laſt. And ſo I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited him to come and ſtay a day or two
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:037133_0031_100C925AC7556160"/>
at Chriſtmas, when we have always a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſort of merry-making here. But it would not do. He ſcorned to talk that palavering ſtuff which ſhe had been uſed to in the marble covered books I told you of. He told her indeed, that it would be the happineſs of his heart to live with her, which I own I thought was as much as could be expected of any man. But Miſs had no notion of marrying one who was only deſirous of living with her. No no, forſooth, her lover muſt declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ready to die for her, which honeſt Wilſon was not ſuch a fool as to offer to do. In the afternoon, however, he got a little into her favour by making a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus or two in the Lady's Diary, and ſhe condeſcended to ſay ſhe did not think Mr. Wilſon had been ſo good a ſcholar, but he ſoon ſpoilt all again. We had a bit of a hop in the evening. The young man though he had not much taſte for thoſe ſort of gambols, yet thought he could foot it a little in the old faſhioned way. So he aſked Betſey to be his part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. But when he aſked what dance they ſhould call, Miſs drew up her head, and in a ſtrange gibberiſh, ſaid ſhe ſhould dance nothing but a <hi>Minuet de la Cour,</hi>
                  <pb n="32" facs="unknown:037133_0032_100C8324E6AC40D8"/>
and ordered him to call it; Wilſon ſtared, and honeſtly told her ſhe muſt call it her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for he could neither ſpell nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce ſuch outlandiſh words. I burſt out a laughing, and told him, I ſuppoſed it was ſomething like queſtions and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and if ſo, that was much merrier than dancing. Seeing her partner ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtock ſtill, and not knowing how to get out of the ſcrape, the girl began by herſelf, and fell to ſwimming, and ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and capering, and flouriſhing, and poſturing, for all the world juſt like the man on the ſlack rope at our fair. But ſeeing Wilſon ſtanding like a ſtuck pig, and we all laughing at her, ſhe reſolved to wreak her malice upon him; ſo with a look of rage and diſdain, ſhe adviſed him to go down country bumpkin, with the dairy maid, who would make a much fitter partner, as well as wife, for him than ſhe could. "I am quite of your mind, Miſs," ſaid he with more ſpirit than I thought was in him; "you may make a good partner for a dance, but you would make a ſad one to go through life with. I will take my leave of you, Miſs, with this ſhort ſtory. I had lately a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty large concern in hay-jobbing, which
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:037133_0033_100C925F0E0FAF88"/>
took me to London. I waited a good while in the Hay-market for my dealer, and to paſs the time I ſtepped into a ſort of ſinging play-houſe there, where I was grieved to the heart to ſee young women painted and dizened out, and capering away juſt as you have been doing. I thought it bad enough, and wondered the quality could be entertained with ſuch indecent mummery. But little did I think to meet with the ſame paint, finery, and tricks in a farm houſe. I will never marry a woman who deſpiſes me, nor the ſtation in which I ſhould place her, and ſo I take my leave. Poor girl! how ſhe <hi>was</hi> provoked! to be publickly refuſed and turned off, as it were, by a grazier! But it was of uſe to ſome of the other girls who have not held up their heads quite ſo high ſince, nor painted quite ſo red, but have condeſcended to ſpeak to their equals.</p>

               <p>As ſoon as Mr. Bragwell had done paying his men, Mr. Worthy ſaid to him, "I have made it a habit, and I hope not an unprofitable one, of trying to turn to ſome moral uſe, not only all the events of daily life, but all the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments of it too. And though it oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs ſo often, I hardly know one that ſets me thinking more ſeriouſly than the ordinary buſineſs you have been juſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging. Aye," ſaid Bragwell, "it ſets me thinking too, and ſeriouſly as you ſay, when I obſerve how much the price of wages is increaſed." "Yes, yes, you are ready enough to think of that," ſaid Worthy, "but you ſay not a word of how much the value of your land is increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that the more you pay, the more you can afford to pay. But the thoughts I ſpoke of are quite of another caſt. When I call in my labourers on a Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day night to pay them, it often brings to my mind the great and general day of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, when I, and you, and all of us, ſhall be called to our grand and awful reckoning, when we ſhall go to receive
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:037133_0035_100C926283FDF900"/>
                  <hi>our</hi> wages, maſter, and ſervants, farmer and labourer. When I ſee that one of my men has failed of the wages he ſhould have received, becauſe he has been idling at a fair; another has loſt a day by a drinking bout, a third confeſſes that though he had taſk-work, and might have earned ſtill more, yet he has been careleſs and has not his full pay to receive; this, I ſay, ſometimes ſets me on thinking whether I alſo have made the moſt of my time. And when I came to pay even the more diligent who have worked all the week; when I reflect that even theſe have done no more than it was their duty to do, I cannot help ſaying to myſelf, night is come, Saturday night is come. No repentance or diligence on the part of theſe poor men can now make a bad week's work good. This week is gone into eternity. To-morrow is the ſeaſon of reſt; working time is over. My life alſo will ſoon be ſwallowed up in eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; ſoon the ſpace allotted me for dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, for labour, will be over. Soon will the grand queſtion be aſked, 'what haſt thou done? Didſt thou uſe thy work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing days to the end for which they were given?' With ſome ſuch thoughts I
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:037133_0036_100C9264C6EF0E10"/>

Indeed he commonly ordered his affairs, and regulated his journies with an eye to this object. "To paſs a Sunday with an irreligious family," ſaid he, "is always unpleaſant, often unſafe. I ſeldom find I can do them any good, and they may perhaps do me ſome harm. At leaſt I am giving a ſanction to their manner of paſſing it, if I paſs it in the ſame manner. If I reprove them, I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject myſelf to the charge of ſingularity, and of being righteous over much; if I do <hi>not</hi> reprove them, I confirm and ſtrengthen them in evil.
