            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>PRIESTLEY, Paine, and other obſervers on Mr. Burke's celebrated Philippick, have been read with avidity in America, while a pamphlet of equal merit has eſcaped the publick eye.

               <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOUR lordſhip's character as a patriot, a philoſopher, and the firm friend of the general rights of man, encourages me to preſent to you the following Obſervations on Mr. Burke's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Reflections on the Revolution in France. They claim no popular attention for the ornaments of ſtile in which they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered; they can attract no admiration from the faſcinating charms of eloquence; they are directed, not to <hi>captivate,</hi> but to <hi>convince;</hi> and it is on the preſumption that your lordſhip attends more to the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> and <hi>end</hi> of literary compoſitions, than to the <hi>art</hi> of their arrangement, which induces me to flatter myſelf with your approbation.</p>
            <p>It is not ſurpriſing that an event, the moſt <hi>important</hi> to the deareſt intereſts of mankind, the moſt <hi>ſingular</hi> in its nature, and the moſt <hi>aſtoniſhing</hi> in its means, ſhould not only have attracted the curioſity of all civilized nations, but that it ſhould have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged the paſſions of all <hi>reflecting</hi> men.</p>
            <p>Two parties are already formed in this country, who behold the French Revolution with a very oppoſite temper: To the one, it inſpires the ſentiment of <hi>exultation</hi> and <hi>rapture;</hi> and to the other, <hi>indignation</hi> and <hi>ſcorn.</hi> I ſhall not take upon me to conſider what are the <hi>ſecret</hi> paſſions which have given birth to theſe laſt ſentiments; and ſhall content myſelf with obſerving, that Mr. Burke has undertaken to be the oracle of this laſt party. The abilities of this gentleman have been fully acknowledged by the impatience with which the publick have waited for his obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and when we conſider that he has been in a manner edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in the great ſchool of Parliament, that he has aſſiſted in the publick councils of the Engliſh nation for the greater part of his life, we muſt ſuppoſe him fully competent to the taſk he has un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, of cenſuring the politicks of our neighbour kingdom, and entering into an exact definition of thoſe native rights which equally attach themſelves to every deſcription of men.</p>
            <p>Is there a rational obſervation, or argument, in moral exiſtence, which this gentleman (ſo highly favoured by nature and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances for political debate) could poſſibly have paſſed over, on a

               </hi> of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, we ſhall be induced to give a fuller credit to our judgment and our feelings, in the view we have taken of this intereſting object, and the pleaſure it has given us.</p>
            <p>Mr. Burke ſets out with throwing a <hi>great deal</hi> of contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cenſure on two club ſocieties in London, for a very harmleſs exertion of natural and conſtitutional liberty. They certainly had a right to compliment the French National Aſſembly on a matter of domeſtick government, and to expreſs an <hi>approbation</hi> of their conduct, with a freedom equal to that which Mr. Burke has taken in his letter to expreſs his <hi>abhorrence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The National Aſſembly of France have taken no ſuch <hi>ſupercili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtate</hi> upon them, as would render ſuch a communication of ſentiment ridiculous or preſumptuous. As the patrons of <hi>equal liberty,</hi> they have not diſdained the addreſſes of the <hi>meaneſt</hi> indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual; conſequently the Revolution Society then might ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally expect that their addreſſes would have met with a civil recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though not clothed with the "dignity of the whole repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative majeſty of the whole Engliſh nation."</p>
            <p>But Mr. Burke thinks that theſe gentlemen have ſo ſtrong a predilection in favour of the democratick arrangements which have taken place in France, that they have been induced to wiſh, if not to indulge an hope, that ſome very important reformations may in the proceſs of time alſo take place in this country; and theſe harmleſs operations of the mind in a <hi>few obſcure</hi> individuals, (for ſuch are the members deſcribed who compoſe the offending clubs) have produced in Mr. Burke, apprehenſions no ways con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the <hi>high</hi> opinion he has formed of the Engliſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, or of the <hi>ſtrong</hi> attachment which he ſuppoſes all that is <hi>great</hi> and <hi>good</hi> in the nation have to it.</p>
            <p>Dr. Price, whoſe animated love for mankind and the ſpread of general happineſs, moved him to expreſs the effuſion of his patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otick ſentiment, in a ſermon preached the 4th of Nov. 1789, at the diſſenting meeting houſe in the Old Jewry, is cenſured by Mr. Burke in <hi>ſevere,</hi> and even <hi>acrimonious terms.</hi> Among other parts of the very offenſive matter with which he charges this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, the having aſſerted that the <hi>King of Great Britain owes his right to the Crown by the choice of the people,</hi> is particularly ſelected, as worthy an hiſtorical and argumentative confutation.</p>
            <p>The liberty that was taken in the year 1688, by a convention of Lords and Commons, to depoſe king James the reigning ſov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ereign from the throne, and to veſt the ſovereignty of the realm
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:023517_0005_0FBFC27EAB0E27E0"/>
in his daughter Mary, and her huſband the prince of Orange; and afterwards by the legiſlature, to paſs an act to ſettle the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion in queen Anne and her iſſue, and in default of theſe, in the heirs of king William's body, and in default of theſe, in the houſe of Hanover, (the Proteſtant deſcendants of the houſe of Stuart in the female line;) and this to the prejudice not only of king James, but of his ſon, who had been acknowledged as the lawful heir of his throne; and alſo to the prejudice of the houſe of Savoy, who by lineal deſcent were the next in regular ſucceſſion; are indeed facts, which <hi>might warrant a plain thinking man</hi> in the opinion, that the preſent reigning family owe their ſucceſſion to the choice or aſſent of the people. But, in Mr. Burke's opinion, theſe facts are of no weight, "becauſe the whole family of the Stuarts were not entirely left out of the ſucceſſion, and a native of England advanced to the throne; and becauſe it was declared in the act of ſucceſſion, that the Proteſtant line drawn from James the firſt, was abſolutely neceſſary for the ſecurity of the realm."</p>
            <p>That thoſe individuals of the family of the Stuarts, who had never committed any offence againſt the peace of the country, and whoſe mode of faith was not injurious to its welfare, ſhould not be ſet aſide in favour of an abſolute ſtranger to the blood, was certainly a <hi>juſt meaſure;</hi> and it was certainly <hi>wiſe</hi> to leave as <hi>few</hi> competitors to the crown as poſſible, whether on grounds <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>und<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in juſtice, or in mere plauſibility. But there was a reaſon ſtill more forcible for the conduct of the two Houſes of Convention, and afterwards for the Parliament in their conſtitutional capacity; and the reaſon is this, that <hi>without the prince of Orange, and the aſſiſtance of his Dutch army, there could have been no Revolution.</hi> For the Engliſh nation at large was ſo little convinced of the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere and grave neceſſity</hi> which Mr. Burke talks of, that the people of themſelves would never have been rouſed to have depoſed king James; and they regarded all his innovations with ſuch a <hi>conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutional phlegm,</hi> that had this unfortunate monarch poſſeſſed the qualities of <hi>firmneſs, perſeverance,</hi> or <hi>patience,</hi> he muſt either have been killed by the dark means of <hi>aſſaſſination,</hi> or he would have <hi>continued on the throne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the friends of the Revolution knew they could not do without the aſſiſtance of king William, is plain, by their laying aſide the intention of veſting Mary <hi>ſingly</hi> with the ſovereignty, on his declaring that if this event took place, he would return to Holland, and leave them to themſelves.</p>
            <p>However ſtrongly the warm friends of freedom might wiſh that this abſtract right of the people, of chooſing their own magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates, and depoſing them for ill conduct, had been laid open to
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:023517_0006_0FBFC28060B91B10"/>
the publick by a formal declaration of ſuch a right in the acts of ſucceſſion, this certainly was not a period of time for carrying theſe wiſhes into execution. The whole body of the people had ſwallowed deeply of the <hi>poiſon</hi> of church policy; <hi>paſſive obedience,</hi> by their means, had ſo entirely ſupplanted the <hi>abſtract notion</hi> of the <hi>rights of men,</hi> which prevailed in the oppoſition to Charles the firſt; and ſo deſirous were the triumphant party to prevent the revival of ſuch a principle, by which their intereſts had been af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, that they took care to confound the <hi>only juſt authority</hi> they had for their conduct, in as great <hi>a miſt of words and terms as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> Beſides, would William, who was the ſoul of the whole proceeding, have given way to a claim, by which, in the plaineſt terms, he was bound to his good behaviour?</p>
            <p>Mr. Hume juſtly ſuppoſes, that if the revolution had happened one hundred years after it did, it would have been <hi>materially dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent</hi> in all its circumſtances. Inſtead of thinking with Mr. Burke, that ſuch a plain declaration of the rights of men would have tended to diſturb the quiet of the nation, I firmly believe that it would have had a contrary effect; for, in this caſe, thoſe endleſs diſputes between the <hi>Nonjurors, Tories,</hi> and <hi>Whigs,</hi> would ſoon have had an end. For, the queſtion not being involved in that <hi>obſcurity, contradiction,</hi> and <hi>abſurdity,</hi> in which it was enveloped by the revolutioniſts, <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>reaſon</hi> would have reſumed their ſway; <hi>party jarjon</hi> would have been exploded; the people would have given a cheerful obedience to the new government; and that dreadful <hi>neceſſity</hi> by which Sir Robert Walpole excuſed the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing a ſettled <hi>ſyſtem of corruption</hi> into the adminiſtration, would never have exiſted.</p>
            <p>When the ſucceſſion to a crown in one family, or even the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of private property, owes its origin to the people, moſt undoubtedly the authority from whence it is derived, attaches it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the gift as equally in every individual of the family through the whole line of ſucceſſion, as in the firſt poſſeſſor. And I can hardly believe, that there was <hi>one</hi> enlightened member who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed part of that legiſlative body who ſettled the ſucceſſion to the throne, could poſſibly think that body poſſeſſed of ſuch a plenitude of power, as ſhould give them a right, not only to <hi>ſet aſide</hi> the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of their anceſtors, but to <hi>bind their poſterity,</hi> to all ſucceeding generations, in the permanent chains of an unalterable law. Should we once admit of <hi>a power ſo incompatible with the conditions of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,</hi> and only reſerved for the dictates of <hi>divine wiſdom,</hi> we have not, in theſe enlightened days, improved on the politicks of the fanatick atheiſt Hobbes: <hi>For he ſuppoſes an original right in the people to chooſe their governors;</hi> but, in exerting this right, the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen and his poſterity for ever loſe their native privileges, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

bound through the whole ſeries of generations to the ſervice of a maſter's will.</p>
            <p>We will now take into conſideration the nature and tendency of the two different compliments which have been paid by Dr. Price and Mr. Burke to his Majeſty and his ſucceſſors. Dr. Price, I think, puts their right to government on the <hi>moſt dignified,</hi> and perhaps, in the event of things, on the <hi>moſt permanent</hi> footing. But Mr. Burke would have done well to conſider, whether ſuch a compliment as he is willing to pay to royalty is at all <hi>proper,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the ſubject to make, or the King to receive. To a weak prince, it would be apt to cancel in his mind <hi>all the obligations</hi> which he owes to the people; and, by flattering him in a <hi>vain</hi> conceit of a mere perſonal right, tempt him to break thoſe ſacred ties which ought to <hi>bind</hi> and <hi>direct</hi> his government. I am apt to believe, that almoſt <hi>all the vices</hi> of royal adminiſtration have prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally been occaſioned by a <hi>ſlaviſh adulation</hi> in the language of their ſubjects; and, to the <hi>ſhame of the Engliſh people</hi> it muſt be ſpoken, that none of the enſlaved nations in the world addreſs the throne in a more <hi>fulſome</hi> and <hi>hyperbolical</hi> ſtile of ſubmiſſive flattery.</p>
            <p>To a <hi>wiſe</hi> and a <hi>good</hi> prince, compliments of the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, made and recommended by Mr. Burke, would be <hi>offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive.</hi> He would conſider it as taking away the <hi>nobleſt</hi> and <hi>ſafeſt title</hi> by which he poſſeſſes his power: He would conſider it as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging a kind of <hi>latent</hi> right in other families; and the liberality of his ſentiment would incline him to triumph in the opinion, that he was <hi>called</hi> to government, and <hi>continued</hi> in it, by the <hi>choice</hi> and <hi>confidence</hi> of a free nation.</p>
            <p>Mr. Burke ſeems to adopt <hi>prejudice, opinion,</hi> and the powers of the <hi>imagination,</hi> as the <hi>ſafeſt grounds</hi> on which <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>good</hi> ſtateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men can eſtabliſh or continue the happineſs of ſocieties. Theſe have always been imputed by philoſophers (a tribe of men whom indeed Mr. Burke affects much to deſpiſe) as cauſes which have produced all that is <hi>vicious</hi> and <hi>fooliſh</hi> in man, and conſequently have been the fruitful ſource of human <hi>miſery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Burke has certainly a <hi>fine</hi> imagination; but I would not adviſe either <hi>him,</hi> or any of <hi>his admirers,</hi> to give <hi>too much</hi> way to ſuch direction; for if from the virtue of our nature it does not lead us into <hi>crimes,</hi> it always involves us in <hi>error.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The being put into a ſituation clearly to underſtand and to obey the <hi>principles of truth,</hi> appears to be the baſis of our happineſs in this, and our perfection in another world; and the <hi>more</hi> truth is followed and purſued in this dark vale of human ignorance and miſery, the <hi>more</hi> we ſhall <hi>increaſe</hi> our mundane felicity, and <hi>ſecure</hi> the bleſſings of a future exiſtence. <hi>Every opinion</hi> which deviates from <hi>truth,</hi> muſt ever be a <hi>treacherous</hi> guide; and the more it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viates from it, it becomes the <hi>more dangerous.</hi>

Though a falſe opinion of the rights and powers of citizens may <hi>enſlave</hi> the ductile mind into a ſtate of paſſive obedience, and thus ſecure the peace of government; yet in the ſame degree does it inflate the <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>arrogance</hi> of princes, until all conſiderations of <hi>rectitude</hi> give way to <hi>will,</hi> the barriers of perſonal ſecurity are flung down, and thence ariſes that <hi>tremendous neceſſity</hi> which muſt be followed by a ſtate of <hi>violence</hi> and <hi>anarchy,</hi> which Mr. Burke ſo <hi>juſtly</hi> dreads. That this is the caſe, the experience of all ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties of men who acknowledge a <hi>power</hi> in their princes <hi>paramount</hi> to all reſiſtance, fully evinces. Theſe ſocieties are obliged often to have recourſe to violence and maſſacre; not indeed to eſtabliſh any popular rights, but in the way of force, to wreck their ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>As to the right of <hi>caſhiering</hi> or <hi>depoſing</hi> monarchs for miſgov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, I cannot poſſibly agree with Mr. Burke, that in England it only exiſted in that Convention of the two Houſes in 1688, which exerciſed this power over King James and his legal ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors.

But it is the <hi>wiſdom,</hi> and not the <hi>folly</hi> of the National Aſſembly, which gives <hi>offence</hi> to their <hi>enemies;</hi> and <hi>forces even Mr. Burke</hi> to contradict, in this inſtance, the rule which he has laid down, "That monarchs ſhould not be depoſed for miſconduct, but only when its criminality is of a kind to render their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment totally incompatible with the ſafety of the people."</p>
            <p>But before we leave the ſubject of Dr. Price's patriotick effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, we muſt take notice of a very heavy charge laid againſt him by Mr. Burke—no leſs than that of <hi>prophaning</hi> the beautiful and prophetick ejaculation, commonly called, <hi>Nunc dimittis!</hi> made on the firſt proclamation of our Saviour in the Temple, and applying it, <hi>"with an inhuman and unnatural rapture, to the moſt horrid, atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and afflicting ſpectacle,</hi> that perhaps was ever exhibited to the <hi>pity</hi> and <hi>indignation</hi> of mankind." That Mr. Burke's imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was greatly affected by a ſcene, which he deſcribes in the higheſt glow of colouring, I can well believe; but Dr. Price, who claſſes with that deſcription of men ſtiled by Mr. Burke <hi>abſtract philoſophers,</hi> has been uſed to carry his mind, in a long ſeries of ideas, to the conſequences of actions which ariſe in the paſſing ſcene. Dr. Price then, with <hi>full as much ſympathy</hi> in him <hi>as even
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:023517_0009_0FBFC28F29F7C640"/>
Mr. Burke</hi> can have, might not be greatly moved with the morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications and ſufferings of a <hi>very few perſons,</hi> however highly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed for the ſplendour of their rank, when thoſe mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions led the way, or ſecured the <hi>preſent and future happineſs of twenty four millions of people, with their poſterity,</hi> emancipated by their <hi>manly</hi> exertions, from all that is <hi>degrading</hi> and <hi>afflicting</hi> to the ſenſible mind; and let into the immediate bleſſings of <hi>perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſecurity,</hi> and to the enjoyment of thoſe advantages which above <hi>all others</hi> muſt be delightful to the feelings of an high ſpirited people.</p>
            <p>The <hi>events</hi> of human life, when <hi>properly</hi> conſidered, are but a ſeries of <hi>benevolent providences:</hi> Many of them, though very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant in their conſequences, are too much confounded with the common tranſactions of men, to be obſerved; but whenever the believer thinks he perceives the <hi>omnipotent will</hi> more immediately declaring itſelf in favour of the future <hi>perfection</hi> and <hi>happineſs</hi> of the moral world, he is naturally led into the ſame ecſtacies of <hi>hope</hi> and <hi>gratitude,</hi> with which Simeon was tranſported by the view of the infant Meſſiah. Has Mr. Burke never heard of any mille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium, but that fanciful one which is ſuppoſed to exiſt in the kingdom of the ſaints? If this ſhould be the caſe, I would recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to him to read <hi>Newton on the Prophecies.</hi> He will find that this moſt reſpectable Biſhop, <hi>who was no ranter,</hi> is of opinion, that <hi>ſome paſſages</hi> in the Revelations point out a period of time when the <hi>iron</hi> ſceptre of <hi>arbitrary</hi> ſway ſhall be broken; when <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs ſhall prevail</hi> over the whole earth, and a <hi>correct</hi> ſyſtem of equity take place in the conduct of man. Every providence, therefore, by which any <hi>inſuperable object</hi> to this tranſcendent bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appears to be taken away, muſt rationally draw forth ejacula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>gratitude</hi> from the <hi>benevolent</hi> Chriſtian. What ideas do more naturally aſſociate in the human mind, than thoſe of the firſt appearance of the infant Jeſus, and his future univerſal reign in the hearts of his people?</p>
            <p>But Mr. Burke thinks, that there was at leaſt a great impropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety in expreſſing an approbation of the ſpirited conduct of the French nation, before time and circumſtances had manifeſted that the freedom they had gained, had been uſed with <hi>wiſdom</hi> in the forming a new conſtitution of government, or in improving the old one. "When I ſee," ſays Mr. Burke, "the ſpirit of liberty in action, I ſee a ſtrong principle at work; and this for a while is all I can poſſibly know of it. The wild gas, the fixed air, is plainly broke looſe; but we ought to ſuſpend our judgment un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the firſt efferveſcence is a little ſubſided, till the liquor is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and until we ſee ſomething deeper than the agitation of a troubled and frothy ſurface."</p>

               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:023517_0010_0FBFC290A09239F0"/>
The French Revolution was attended with ſomething ſo <hi>new</hi> in the hiſtory of human affairs; there was ſomething ſo <hi>ſingular,</hi> ſo <hi>unique,</hi> in that <hi>perfect</hi> unanimity in the people; in that <hi>firm</hi> ſpirit which baſhed <hi>every hope</hi> in the <hi>intereſted,</hi> that they could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly divide them into parties, and render them the inſtruments of a reſubjection to their old bondage; that it naturally excited the <hi>ſurpriſe</hi> and the <hi>admiration</hi> of all men. It appeared as a <hi>ſudden ſpread of an enlightened ſpirit,</hi> which promiſed to act as an effectual and permanent barrier to the inlet of thoſe uſurpa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p>This was a triumph of <hi>ſufficient importance</hi> to call forth the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ultation of individuals, and the approbation of ſocieties. But the two clubs who have the <hi>misfortune</hi> to fall under Mr. Burke's ſevere cenſure, did not teſtify a formal approbation of the conduct of their neighbours, till the deputies they had choſen for the tranſaction of their affairs, had manifeſted a virtue <hi>equal</hi> to ſo high a truſt; for no ſooner was the power of the court <hi>ſufficiently</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued to enable them to act with <hi>freedom</hi> and <hi>effect,</hi> than they gave an example of <hi>diſintereſted magnanimity,</hi> that has <hi>no parallel</hi> in the conduct of <hi>any</hi> preceding aſſembly of men, and which was <hi>never ſurpaſſed by any individual.</hi> That memorable day in which the members of the National Aſſembly, with a <hi>virtuous enthuſiaſm,</hi> vied with each other in the alacrity with which they ſurrendered to the people all their feudal privileges, will for ever ſtand in the records of time as a monument of their <hi>ſingular greatneſs.</hi> Such an inſtance of human virtue was ſurely a <hi>proper ſubject of applauſe and congratulation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Men who have ſuffered in their perſonal intereſts by the new order of things in France, muſt naturally be inclined to <hi>exagger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate</hi> every blemiſh which appears in the conduct of a multitude, by whoſe ſpirit they have been deprived of many fond privileges. Their <hi>petulant</hi> obſervations, whilſt their minds are <hi>heated</hi> by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aginary wrongs and injuries, is <hi>excuſable;</hi> becauſe it is a <hi>weakneſs</hi> almoſt inſeparable from <hi>human frailty.</hi> It would, however, have become <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> from whom might have been expected a <hi>more ſympathiſing</hi> indulgence towards the <hi>friends</hi> and <hi>promoters</hi> of liberty, to have been more <hi>candid</hi> in their cenſures; but in no part of Europe perhaps, have the evils which muſt <hi>neceſſarily</hi> attend all Revolutions, and eſpecially a Revolution ſo <hi>complete</hi> and <hi>compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive</hi> as that which has taken place in France, been <hi>more exagger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated,</hi> and <hi>more affectedly</hi> lamently.</p>
            <p>Had this <hi>great work</hi> been effected without the ſhedding one drop of <hi>innocent</hi> or even <hi>guilty</hi> blood, without doubt it would have better pleaſed the <hi>generous</hi> and <hi>benevolent</hi> mind. But, was it <hi>poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:023517_0011_0FBFC292246B70C8"/>
that ſuch a pleaſing circumſtance could ever have had an exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? If we take into conſideration that <hi>animoſity</hi> which ſubſiſted between the <hi>ariſtocratiſts</hi> and <hi>democratiſts</hi> on the eve of the Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, an animoſity which was greatly heightened by the impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <hi>inſults</hi> which the <hi>Tier Etat</hi> had received from the firſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned body, we ſhall rather <hi>wonder at the moderation</hi> with which the people uſed their <hi>complete</hi> victory, than lament their cruelty. After the ſucceſsful ſtorming the king's camp, and the flight or deſertion of his Janizaries, inſtead of that <hi>order</hi> and voluntary <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi> to diſcipline which appeared in an armed mob, and which prevented <hi>all</hi> infringement on the rights of property, had the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued party been delivered over to the <hi>outrage</hi> and the <hi>pillage</hi> of the rabble, the <hi>horrid</hi> ſcene might have been <hi>parallelled</hi> by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples drawn from the guilty violence of <hi>civilized</hi> nations, without calling our attention to <hi>Theban</hi> and <hi>Thracian orgies,</hi> or a proceſſion of American <hi>ſavages</hi> entering into <hi>Onondaga.</hi> I do not indeed exactly know how much blood has been ſpilled in France, or how many individuals have fallen a ſacrifice in the publick commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but by all the general accounts which have been tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us, the hiſtory of monarchies will point out as many ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers who have fallen in <hi>one hour</hi> to the <hi>rage</hi> and <hi>outrageous pride</hi> of kingly deſpots.</p>
            <p>The puniſhment of the lamp poſt, it muſt be owned, ſtrikes terror to the mind, and calls forth an immediate effuſion of <hi>ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy</hi> to the ſufferer. But when <hi>candid reflection</hi> ſuperſedes the <hi>firſt emotions</hi> of human tenderneſs, this truth will force itſelf on our conſideration, that a people who had been uſed to ſuch <hi>barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi> ſpectacles as that of beholding wretches, whoſe <hi>deſtitute pov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty</hi> had in a manner <hi>compelled</hi> to the forlorn courſe of highway robbery, broken on a wheel, and <hi>lingering</hi> out the laſt hours of life under the <hi>agonizing</hi> ſtrokes of a ſtern executioner, would nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urally regard hanging as a <hi>mild</hi> puniſhment on men whom they conſidered as the worſt of criminals. Let us rejoice, then, that ſuch <hi>dreadful legal executions,</hi> which muſt from their nature tend to <hi>barbariſe</hi> men, are happily put an end to by the Revolution.</p>
            <p>But Mr. Burke is now come to a ſcene which is calculated to draw forth <hi>all</hi> the energies of his imagination, and which conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently he deſcribes with the <hi>higheſt poſſible</hi> colouring. This is no other than the 6th of October, 1789, when the king and queen were led in triumph to Paris. I very much <hi>honour the king of France</hi> for that eaſe of temper which has enabled him to go through all his perſonal mortifications with <hi>a manly dignity;</hi> but it muſt be confeſſed that he brought them on himſelf, by a conduct, which, to ſay the beſt of it, was altogether imprudent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:023517_0012_0FBFC29447D88B80"/>
The firſt involuntary viſit which he made to the capital, was abſolutely neceſſary, to appeaſe the <hi>fears</hi> and the <hi>reſentment</hi> which had been raiſed by his <hi>ineffectual</hi> attempt to <hi>awe</hi> the deliberations and the reſolutions of the National Aſſembly by an <hi>armed</hi> force. In the ſecond, he was carried to Paris to <hi>prevent</hi> the execution of a <hi>deſign</hi> formed by the court cabal, which, had it ſucceeded, might have <hi>deluged</hi> the nation in blood, and furniſhed the fuel of civil diſcord for years.</p>
            <p>The Pariſians ſhewed no intention, or even deſire, to deprive in any reſpect their king of his perſonal liberty; till, by a very ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious conduct, he appeared to have manifeſted a deſign to corrupt the fidelity of his guards to their new government, and to ſet up the ſtandard of arms in that quarter of the kingdom where the friends of deſpotiſm from every part of Europe might repair with ſafety. The <hi>great</hi> and <hi>unabating</hi> rage and indignation which the enemies to the new conſtitution have ſhewn for what they term the captivity of the king, plainly evinces the <hi>neceſſity</hi> that urged the meaſure.</p>
            <p>Having endeavoured to ſhew the futility of Mr. Burke's obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations and cenſures on the Revolution and Conſtitutional Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and likewiſe, that his ſevere pointed reflections on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the French nation, for having, as he ſays, committed on the vanquiſhed party the moſt <hi>unexampled</hi> acts of atrocious vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, are not founded either in <hi>truth</hi> or <hi>reaſon;</hi> I ſhall proceed with my critical reflections on the animadverſions of my author, who goes on in a very <hi>free manner</hi> to cenſure every part of the French conſtitution, to draw a compariſon between the Britiſh and the Gallie governments as they now exiſt, and to eſtabliſh, in the way of reaſoning, a ſuperiority in favour of the government of his own country.</p>
            <p>To ſhew that the National Aſſembly have committed a very <hi>groſs</hi> and <hi>ruinous</hi> error, in the building a new ſtructure, inſtead of improving an old one; Mr. Burke cites, in a triumphant manner, the conduct of the Engliſh nation. Our oldeſt reformation, he obſerves, is that of <hi>Magna Charta.</hi> "You will ſee, ſays he, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing his correſpondent, that Sir Edward Coke, that great oracle of our law, and indeed all the great men who follow him to Blackſtone, are induſtrious to prove the pedigree of our liberties. They endeavour to prove, that the ancient Charta, the Magna Charta of king John, was connected with another poſitive Charta from Henry the firſt, and that both the one and the other were nothing more than a reaffirmance of the ſtill more ancient ſtanding law of the kingdom." "In the famous law of the third of Charles the firſt, called the Petition of Right, the Parliament ſays to the king—Your ſubjects have inherited this freedom (claiming
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:023517_0013_0FBFC296CE1387E8"/>
their franchiſes) not on abſtract principles as the rights of men, but as the rights of Engliſhmen, and as a patrimony derived from their forefathers."</p>
            <p>This language of the parliament, when pleading for the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of their countrymen at the tribunal of a prince's throne, who was as little inclined to <hi>admit,</hi> and whoſe <hi>prejudices</hi> enabled him as little to <hi>underſtand</hi> the only reaſonable grounds of the argument as any deſpot who ever ſwayed an eaſtern ſceptre, was well adapted to the <hi>character</hi> of the prince, and the <hi>ignorance</hi> of the multitude. But had the <hi>circumſtances</hi> of Charles enabled him to <hi>ſpeak</hi> and to <hi>enforce</hi> the ſentiments of his mind, he would undoubtedly have made the following reply: You tell me upon your <hi>own</hi> authority, and the authority of <hi>your lawyers,</hi> that what you plead ſo ſtrenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly for, is a patrimony derived from your forefathers, and grounded on the ancient law of the land. Be it ſo—Was not this ancient law <hi>ſuperſeded by the authority of arms,</hi> and the <hi>entire</hi> ſubmiſſion of the people to the Norman code eſtabliſhed by Will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iam the Conqueror? <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> then, and the other charters, muſt either have been <hi>extorted</hi> from the <hi>imbecility</hi> of the princes who granted them, or they muſt have iſſued from the <hi>voluntary donations of monarchs;</hi> in either caſe, they only ſtand on a <hi>reſuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> right.</p>
            <p>What the parliament could have anſwered to this plea, I know not, without calling in the aid of an <hi>abſtract right;</hi> which they endeavoured to keep out of the view of the king, with as much care as Mr. Burke <hi>endeavours</hi> to keep it out of the view of all men. But certain it is, that the king, though he did not explicitly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare with all their force the above mentioned ſentiments, yet he acted agreeable to their tenor the moment he got rid of this trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome aſſembly: For, conſidering the articles of the petition of right as a <hi>gift depending on his pleaſure to fulfil or to reſume,</hi> he broke them whenever they thwarted his ſyſtem of adminiſtration, and <hi>impriſoned</hi> thoſe who on the ſtrength of this ſtatute withſtood his authority.</p>
            <p>I have myſelf always conſidered the boaſted birthright of an Engliſhman, as an <hi>arrogant</hi> pretenſion, built on a <hi>beggarly</hi> founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is an arrogant pretenſion, becauſe it intimates a kind of excluſion to the reſt of mankind from the ſame privileges; and it is beggarly, becauſe it reſts our legitimate freedom on the <hi>alms</hi> of our princes.</p>
            <p>I muſt own I was ſomewhat ſurpriſed to find a gentleman of poliſhed manners, who has ſpent the beſt part of his life in the company of thoſe who <hi>affect</hi> the niceſt conformity to the rules of a refined civility, addreſſing the auguſt repreſentatives of the moſt <hi>gallant</hi> and <hi>reſpectable</hi> of the European nations, in terms which I

ſhould not uſe to a ſet of chimney ſweepers, though acting the moſt ridiculouſly out of their ſphere. Neither do I chooſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat all thoſe expreſſions of ineffable contempt, which the ſtrong glow of Mr. Burke's imagination has ſcattered through the whole of his reprehenſions.</p>
            <p>It is not my intention to make any formal compariſon between the new conſtitution of France, and the preſent exiſting conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of England; or to preſume to cenſure a government, from which an induſtrious people receive protection, and with which the large majority of the nation are entirely ſatisfied. Yet it may not be inexpedient to obſerve, that we cannot with any grounds of <hi>reaſon</hi> or <hi>propriety,</hi> ſet up our own conſtitution as the model which all other nations ought <hi>implicitly</hi> to follow, unleſs we are <hi>certain</hi> that it beſtows the <hi>greateſt</hi> poſſible happineſs on the people which in the nature of things any government can beſtow. We ought to be <hi>certain,</hi> that this <hi>model</hi> will bear the moſt <hi>nice</hi> and <hi>critical</hi> examination. It ought to be void of any of thoſe <hi>obvious,</hi> or more <hi>concealed</hi> cauſes, which produce <hi>preſent evils,</hi> and carry the mind to apprehenſions of <hi>future miſchiefs.</hi> We ought not at leaſt to have had a <hi>national debt,</hi> ſwelled to a <hi>magnitude</hi> which <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifies</hi> even the <hi>moſt ſanguine</hi> for its conſequences. Our parliaments ought to have been <hi>eminently</hi> diſtinguiſhed for their <hi>integrity,</hi> and a <hi>total</hi> independence of any <hi>corrupt influence;</hi> and no <hi>neceſſity ought to have exiſted in our affairs,</hi> which have obliged us to <hi>endure impoſts</hi> which our anceſtors would have <hi>rejected with horror,</hi> and <hi>reſiſted.</hi> If an Engliſhman ſees any thing which is amiſs in his own gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, he ought not undoubtedly to look forward to any other remedy than thoſe which the lenient hand of reformation will ſupply. But when the old veſſel of a commonwealth is <hi>torn to pieces</hi> by the <hi>ſhocks</hi> it has ſuſtained from <hi>contending parties;</hi> when the people, diſdaining and rejecting all thoſe fond opinions by which they have been <hi>enſlaved to miſery,</hi> aſſert their native right of forming a government for themſelves; ſurely in ſuch a caſe the builders are bound by no law of <hi>duty</hi> or <hi>reaſon</hi> to make uſe of theſe old materials in the ſtructure of their new conſtitution, which they ſuppoſe to have been of an injurious tendency. The leaders of the French Revolution, and their followers, ſee <hi>none of thoſe ſtriking beauties</hi> in the old laws and rules of the Gothick in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of Europe, which Mr. Burke does. They do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to have any of the ſpirit of antiquarians among them; and they have not perceived, in the experience of old or ancient times, a <hi>perfect harmony</hi> ariſing from <hi>oppoſition</hi> of intereſts; nor can they <hi>underſtand</hi> how ſuch a combination can be formed as ſhall produce it. In ſuch a view of things, they have choſen a ſimple rule for the model of their new ſtructure, yet regulated with all that <hi>art</hi> and
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:023517_0015_0FBFC2A272E75388"/>
               <hi>deſign</hi> which the experience of ages affords to the wiſdom of man. They are accuſed of having entirely diſmiſſed that uſeful guide <hi>experience</hi> from their councils, but they think they have made <hi>the beſt uſe</hi> of it; whether this opinion of theirs is founded in truth, time, and the future hiſtory of man, muſt evince.</p>
            <p>Mr. Burke, reaſoning from what I regard as a groundleſs ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, very pathetically laments, and very ſeverely reprehends the conduct of thoſe, who, holding out falſe and treacherous lures to the king, led him into conceſſions fatal to his perſonal power, and the conſtitution of the monarchy. That the parliaments of France never intended to make any <hi>alteration</hi> in the old govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I am thoroughly perſuaded; and I am equally perſuaded, that they fondly imagined the people would <hi>freely</hi> give their money for the redreſs of ſome of the moſt heavy of the grievances under which they laboured. They knew, by the experience of paſt times, that in voting by orders, the people had never gained any <hi>ſolid</hi> advantage from an aſſembly of the States General. Neither the court, nor the parliament of Paris, who made the king ſo many ſplendid promiſes, were aware of the conſequences which muſt ariſe from the general ſpread of knowledge among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and in the event of things, they were <hi>both diſappointed</hi> of their purpoſes; for the <hi>Tier Etat,</hi> reflecting on the <hi>old practices</hi> which the <hi>crown,</hi> the <hi>clergy,</hi> and the <hi>nobility</hi> had uſed againſt them, were determined to throw the whole weight of their natural ſcale into the balance, and to redreſs their own grievances, without waiting the effect of <hi>humble</hi> petitions and <hi>diſcordant</hi> councils. That neither the king, nor the parliaments of France, could long have prevented the <hi>full</hi> exertion of this power, (had they foreſeen all the conſequences which did ariſe from ſuffering the meeting of the States General,) is to me very plain. A <hi>regeneration</hi> of the conſtitution would have been <hi>equally</hi> effected; but it would have been attended with a <hi>tremendous</hi> difference in its circumſtances. It would have been uſhered in by a general bankruptey, and the waſte of civil blood. "Our enemies," ſays a popular Leader in the National Aſſembly, "may, by their machinations, make us buy our liberties dear, but they cannot deprive us of them." "This breach of confidence," as Mr. Burke terms it, "to an eaſy and condeſcending king, will have a dreadful effect on the intereſts of mankind, by ſanctifying the dark ſuſpicious maxims of tyrannous diſtruſt; and will teach kings to tremble at what will be called the deluſive plauſibilities of <hi>moral politicians."</hi> Be this as it may, the people of France had <hi>certainly</hi> a right to provide for their own <hi>ſecurity</hi> and <hi>welfare</hi> on thoſe principles which <hi>they</hi> thought the moſt conducive to this <hi>great end,</hi> and to leave it to the wiſdom of other nations to make ſuitable proviſion for theirs.
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:023517_0016_0FBFC2A61B045220"/>
It behoves them, however, to be careful to <hi>cheriſh</hi> and <hi>preſerve</hi> the liberty they have <hi>ſo nobly</hi> gained; to ſuffer no intemperate ſpirit to produce that licentiouſneſs which muſt bring anarchy in its train; nor to indulge a <hi>capricious impatience,</hi> by which their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, in working on their paſſions and <hi>miſguiding</hi> their reaſon, may reduce them to their old ſtate of bondage; in which caſe it is <hi>certain,</hi> power will reap <hi>many</hi> advantages from paſt tranſactions, by which it will be enabled to <hi>tie faſt</hi> thoſe <hi>fetters</hi> the giddy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will ſo well deſerve.</p>
            <p>Though I have hitherto ſpared my readers a detail of all the ſevere invectives which Mr. Burke has uſed againſt the leading members who compoſe the National Aſſembly; yet, for the ſake of thoſe principles of <hi>moral rectitude</hi> which the torrent of his elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence appears to <hi>baffle</hi> and <hi>confound,</hi> it will be neceſſary to notice his obſervations on the character and conduct of the nobles who have taken the lead in the French revolution, and who yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to ſupport it. He accuſes them with having aſſiſted in the ſpoil and humiliation of their own order, to poſſeſs a ſure fund for their new followers. "To be attached to the ſubdiviſion, to love the little platoon we belong to in ſociety (ſays Mr. Burke) is the firſt principle, the germ as it were, of publick affections: It is the firſt link in the ſeries by which we proceed towards a love of our country and mankind."</p>
            <p>What <hi>ſplendid emoluments</hi> and what <hi>grand objects</hi> of perſonal ambition thoſe noblemen could have in view, who, whilſt they <hi>generouſly</hi> ſacrificed thoſe privileges which are the moſt fondly cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted by human vanity, ſhut out their entrance to the publick of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the ſtate, by reſolutions which rendered ſuch promotions incompatible with their legiſlative truſt, I know not; but I hope we ſhall not be ſo much <hi>blinded</hi> with the ſplendour of dazzling images, as to confound thoſe <hi>narrow affections</hi> which bind ſmall bodies together by the mutual ties of perſonal intereſt, to that <hi>lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral benevolence,</hi> which, diſdaining the conſideration of every ſelfiſh good, cheerfully ſacrifices <hi>a perſonal intereſt</hi> to the <hi>welfare</hi> of the community.</p>
            <p>Of the liſt of individuals whom Mr. Burke ſelects as examples of <hi>true glory,</hi> and as benefactors rather than deſtroyers of their country, ſome of them ought to have been for ever ſtampt with <hi>infamy,</hi> as the <hi>peſts</hi> and <hi>tyrants</hi> of their ſpecies; and they are all of them of doubtful fame, as to any <hi>honour</hi> derived to their country by their ambitious projects, unleſs a <hi>nation of ſlaves can receive glory</hi> from <hi>a capacity</hi> of becoming the <hi>ſcourage</hi> of other ſocieties.</p>
            <p>Richlieu was the grand inſtrument by which the court of France, in the reign of Louis the fourteenth, was enabled to maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre the greater part of the French Hugonots, and to drive the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:023517_0017_0FBFC2A720CD00D0"/>
remainder out of the kingdom. Cromwell, indeed, who depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſovereign of life, <hi>merely to uſurp his power,</hi> has, with many people, paid the debt of his crimes, by having, through the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral deteſtation which men conceived of his <hi>treachery</hi> and <hi>tyranny,</hi> rendered the Revolution and the Revolutioniſts odious, and thus paved the way for the reſtoration of the old government.</p>
            <p>In the next argument preſented to our attention, Mr. Burke has very ſtrongly entrenched himſelf in the holds of the Britiſh conſtitution; and we will not attempt to purſue him into his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs: For though a natural vanity <hi>might flatter us</hi> with a <hi>deluſive hope</hi> of victory, ariſing from the ſubtle objections which may be urged to every political propoſition; yet the victory would coſt <hi>too dear,</hi> if it ſubjected us to the reproach of any deſign againſt the peace and quiet of the community. But it will not, I think, be deviating from the higheſt point of decency and prudence, to make our objections to his general aſſertions. His propoſition, "that it is the great maſſes of property which form a natural ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part about the leſſer properties in all their gradations," is not in our opinion founded in truth; for every citizen who poſſeſſes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo ſmall a ſhare of property, is <hi>equally</hi> as tenacious of it as the moſt opulent member of ſociety; and this leads him to <hi>reſpect</hi> and to <hi>ſupport</hi> all the laws by which property is protected. It is this ſenſe of perſonal intereſt, which running through every rank in ſociety, and attaching itſelf to every one of its members who are not in the condition of a pauper, forms an impenetrable barrier to the ſecurity of wealth; for otherwiſe, as the numbers of the opulent muſt be <hi>very</hi> ſmall in proportion to the number of thoſe who form the great maſs of the people, <hi>envy</hi> would operate ſo ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully againſt them as to deſtroy the force of artificial ſupports.</p>
            <p>When the conſtitution of France is compleatly ſettled, and the commonwealth reſts upon its baſis, this diſpoſition of the human mind which operates ſo powerfully for the preſervation of peace and order, will, as on former occaſions, regain its natural force. For the operations of <hi>power</hi> on the property of the citizen, is not an <hi>unexempled</hi> event in the hiſtories of civil ſocieties.</p>
            <p>The manner in which the National Aſſembly of France have endeavoured to ſecure and to defend the liberty of the different towns and provinces which compoſe that vaſt empire, come next under Mr. Burke's ſevere criticiſm. But in his <hi>endeavour</hi> to bring men over to his ſentiments on this ſubject, he is obliged to have recourſe to all thoſe <hi>unfair</hi> means which perſons of genius think themſelves entitled to uſe in the courſe of their argument; for what, indeed, but the <hi>deluſive</hi> power of a ſubtle ſophiſtry, can produce an apparent <hi>concord</hi> between propoſitions the moſt <hi>oppoſite
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:023517_0018_0FBFC2A89E9BFFA0"/>
in their nature?</hi> and what but an appeal to the paſſions of the reader, can prevent his aſſent to the <hi>moſt obvious truths?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The National Aſſembly of France are at one time accuſed by Mr. Burke of a ſcheme for <hi>perpetuating</hi> their power, at the expenſe of the rights of election; at another, of acting <hi>weakly</hi> and <hi>meanly</hi> in the having <hi>limited</hi> their ſitting to the <hi>ſhort ſpace of two years.</hi> In one view of things, they are accuſed of drawing to themſelves, and to the city of Paris, <hi>an exorbitance of power,</hi> which, if not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, muſt end in the total ſubjection of the provinces, whoſe nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ural productions and acquired wealth are to be exhauſted to pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per the luxury and gratify the avarice of the capital. In another, their politicks are arraigned, for having left no leading <hi>controling power</hi> in the empire, of <hi>ſufficient energy</hi> to ſupport a neceſſary ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination of its parts. Such <hi>palpable contradictions,</hi> ſuch <hi>little arts</hi> of <hi>miſrepreſentation</hi> we have ſeen daily thrown out in the publick papers by the <hi>hoſtile faction,</hi> who naturally endeavour to <hi>miſlead</hi> the people into a <hi>diſtruſt</hi> of their deputies, becauſe they have guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their liberties with too nice and too jealous a care. But we did not expect to ſee them collected together and ſet off with all the powers of literary compoſition, by one of the greateſt orators of the age; and this in a work which the author holds out as an <hi>exact ſtandard,</hi> by which the limits of <hi>power</hi> and of <hi>freedom</hi> are from henceforth <hi>to receive their bounds.</hi> Neither did we expect to find that the <hi>humane</hi> writer would have ſo far entered into the paſſions of the diſcontented party, as to <hi>envy</hi> the people of Paris that bread which is ſo neceſſary for their ſubſiſtence, and which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be otherwiſe ſupplied but by the produce of the provinces.</p>
            <p>We were alſo greatly ſurprized to find Mr. Burke entering into ſuch contradictions, as at <hi>one time</hi> to repreſent the excellencies of the Engliſh conſtitution as <hi>obvious</hi> to every obſerver, and ſo ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly felt by its ſubjects as <hi>unanimouſly</hi> to bind their affections to its principles, its rules, and its dictates; to the exception only of a few <hi>idle, inſignificant, ſpeculative individuals:</hi> And <hi>at another, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling</hi> left if the queſtion of the abſtract rights of men were brought before the eyes of the people, the moſt <hi>dreadful</hi> confuſions might fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and be attended with the <hi>utter downfall</hi> of every order in the church and ſtate, of <hi>every excluſive</hi> privilege exiſting in its bodies corporate, and with the <hi>general</hi> pillage of the rich.</p>
            <p>Such repreſentations are certainly well adapted to <hi>rouſe</hi> the ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh paſſions of the <hi>timid</hi> mind, and may ſerve the preſent purpoſe of the <hi>hour;</hi> but they will not ſtand the more <hi>candid</hi> and <hi>cool</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions which attend on <hi>time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>legitimate</hi> power by which governments are made or alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, muſt either ſtand on the <hi>native rights</hi> of the ſpecies, or it muſt ſtand on an authority veſted in an individual, or in a limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:023517_0019_0FBFC2AB6E8BB9C8"/>
number of individuals, exalted to this authority, either by the poſitive law of a <hi>revealed will,</hi> or by ſome native ſuperiority <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently</hi> attached to their perſons. That this ſacred truſt has nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er been ſo formally veſted in <hi>any</hi> individual, or in <hi>any given number</hi> of individuals, is in a manner acknowledged by the moſt ſtrenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous advocates for <hi>paſſive obedience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> for all their arguments are built on preſumptive grounds.</p>
            <p>The contrary propoſition to this, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> 
               <hi>that native right in the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial body to chooſe its own government,</hi> which Mr. Burke <hi>condemns</hi> under the deſcription of a <hi>metaphyſical foolery,</hi> is allowed with all its weight of authority by the greateſt part of the Engliſh Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutioniſts; nor can any other <hi>reaſonable</hi> ground of perſuaſion be made uſe of, to bring the people to concur in any plan of ſalutary or neceſſary reformation. With what pretence then, can Mr. Burke charge Dr. Price, or any of his adherents or admirers, with advancing a <hi>novel</hi> or a <hi>miſchievous</hi> doctrine, when they aſſert that all legitimate power is founded on the rights of nature? "But government (ſays Mr. Burke) is not made in virtue of natural rights, which may and do exiſt in total independence of it; and exiſt in much greater clearneſs, and in a much greater degree of abſtract perfection; but their abſtract perfection is their practical defect. By having a right to every thing, they want every thing. Government is a contrivance of human wiſdom, to provide for human wants. Men have a right that theſe wants ſhould be provided for by this wiſdom. Among theſe wants is to be reckoned the want out of a civil ſociety, of a ſufficient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint upon their paſſions. Society requires not only that the paſſions of individuals ſhould be ſubjected, but even in the maſs and body, as well as in the individuals, the inclinations of men ſhould frequently be thwarted, their will controled, and their paſſions brought into ſubjection. This can only be done by a power out of themſelves, and not in the exerciſe of its functions, ſubject to that will, and to thoſe paſſions, which it is in its office to bridle and ſubdue. In this ſenſe, the reſtraints of men, as well as their liberties, are to be reckoned among their rights."</p>
            <p>To this very <hi>ingenious</hi> reaſoning, and theſe <hi>refined</hi> diſtinctions between natural and ſocial rights, the people may poſſibly object, that in delivering themſelves <hi>paſſively</hi> over to the <hi>unreſtrained rule of others</hi> on the plea of controling <hi>their inordinate inclinations</hi> and <hi>paſſions,</hi> they deliver themſelves over to <hi>men,</hi> who, as <hi>men,</hi> and partaking of the <hi>ſame</hi> nature as themſelves, are as liable to be governed by the ſame <hi>principles</hi> and <hi>errors;</hi> and to men who, by the great ſuperiority of their ſtation, having no <hi>common</hi> intereſt with themſelves which might lead them to preſerve a ſalutary check over their vices, muſt be inclined to <hi>abuſe</hi> in the <hi>groſſeſt manner</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:023517_0020_0FBFC2AC5EE1FD98"/>
their truſt. To proceed with Mr. Burke's argument—ſhould the rich and opulent in the nation plead their right to the predomin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant ſway in ſociety, from its being a neceſſary circumſtance to guard their wealth from the gripe of poverty, the men in an inferior ſtate of fortune might argue, that ſhould they give way <hi>to this plea in all its extent,</hi> their moderate poſſeſſions would be expoſed to the burden of <hi>unequal</hi> taxes; for the rich, when poſſeſſed of the <hi>whole</hi> authority of the ſtate, would be ſure to take the <hi>firſt care</hi> of themſelves, if they ſhould not be tempted to ſecure an exoneration of <hi>all</hi> burthens, by dividing the ſpoils of the public; and that the <hi>abuſe</hi> of ſuch high truſts muſt <hi>neceſſarily</hi> ariſe, becauſe to act by ſelfiſh conſiderations, is in the very conſtitution of our nature.</p>
            <p>To ſuch pleas, ſo plauſibly urged on all ſides, I know of no <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi> objection; nor can I think of any expedient to remove the well grounded apprehenſions of the different intereſts which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a commonwealth, than a <hi>fair</hi> and <hi>equal</hi> repreſentation of the <hi>whole</hi> people;—a circumſtance which appears very peculiarly neceſſary in a mixed form of government, where the democratic part of the conſtitution will ever be in danger of being overborne by the energy attending on its higher conſtituent parts.</p>
            <p>On ſuch grounds of reaſoning, there will be found no inſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable objections to thoſe propoſitions of Dr. Price, which are ſo highly cenſured by Mr. Burke, as containing principles of the moſt <hi>ſeditious</hi> and <hi>dangerous</hi> nature; even though we ſhould allow that every government which accords with the opinions and the inclinations of the large majority of the people, is, in an high ſenſe of the term, a legitimate government.</p>
            <p>We ſhall now proceed with that courſe of the argument in which Mr. Burke endeavours to ſhew, that the <hi>unequal</hi> repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation which he allows to have taken place in <hi>our government,</hi> is a <hi>perfection</hi> rather than a <hi>

               </hi> "With us, when we elect popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar repreſentatives, (ſays Mr. Burke, ſtill addreſſing his French correſpondent,) we ſend them to a council in which each man individually is a ſubject, and ſubmitted to a government com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete in all its ordinary functions. With you the elective aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly is the ſovereign, and the ſole ſovereign; all the members therefore are integral parts of the ſole ſovereignty. But with us, it is totally different. With us, the repreſentatives ſeparated from the other parts, can have no action, and no exiſtence. The government is the point of reference of the ſeveral members and diſtricts of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation. This is the centre of our unity. This government of reference is a truſtee for the whole, and not for the parts. So is the other branch of our public council; I mean the Houſe of Lords.

The very inequality of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, which is ſo <hi>fooliſhly</hi> complained of, is perhaps the very thing which prevents us from thinking or acting as members for diſtricts. Cornwall elects as many members as all Scotland; but is Cornwall better taken care of than Scotland?"</p>
            <p>If your Lordſhip ſees the reſult of this argument in the ſame light as I do, you will conſider it as equally recommendatory to an election of the <hi>Lower Houſe</hi> in the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Lords,</hi> as of an inadequate repreſentation made by the election of the Commons. For if the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Lords</hi> are ſeveral and joint ſecurities for the equality of each diſtrict, each province, and each city; why ſhould we throw the country into a ſtate of <hi>riot</hi> and <hi>confuſion</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſeven years? Why ſhould we put ourſelves to electioneering <hi>expenſes?</hi> Would it not be a <hi>more convenient</hi> method to ſuffer the <hi>King</hi> and the Houſe of <hi>Lords to chuſe</hi> our repreſentatives?</p>
            <p>But this is not the point of view in which the friends of equal repreſentation ſee the neceſſity of a reform: They do not alledge that Cornwall is better taken care of than any other diſtrict in Great Britain. The ſubject of their complaint is, that the import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant intereſts of the great body of the Commons is, by our <hi>preſent inadequate ſtate of repreſentation,</hi> ſacrificed to the ambition of <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate</hi> individuals, who by their <hi>command</hi> over boroughs, may make their <hi>market</hi> with government at the <hi>expenſe</hi> of the publick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The <hi>ſtrong</hi> and <hi>firm</hi> oppoſition which the <hi>ruling powers</hi> have given to <hi>every</hi> ſtep towards this <hi>reaſonable</hi> reformation, is not <hi>one o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, Mr. Burke takes upon him to cenſure every part of the conduct of the French Revolutioniſts; and among other acts <hi>one</hi> which I have always conſidered as founded in <hi>truth, religion,</hi> and the <hi>pureſt morality;</hi> it is that of annihilating by the force of a bright example, thoſe notions found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on <hi>falſe</hi> principles of honour, which fell ſo <hi>ſeverely</hi> and ſo

               <hi>cruelly</hi> on every family who had the misfortune to have produced one <hi>real</hi> or <hi>pretended</hi> culprit. The infamy which families ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the miſconduct of any of its individual members, was one of the <hi>ſtrongeſt</hi> reaſons which have been urged for <hi>perſonal</hi> impriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onment at pleaſure; and when this dreadful engine of deſpotiſm was removed, it ſurely became expedient to <hi>emancipate</hi> the people from the <hi>terror</hi> of this impending evil. But when the <hi>moſt laud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able tranſactions</hi> of men are repreſented as <hi>crimes,</hi> we ought to be <hi>cautious</hi> how we give ear to the ſuggeſtions of their <hi>accuſer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the perſonal mortifications of the Queen of France, Mr. Burke finds great reaſon to lament that the age of chivalry is no more; for had the ſame ſpirit exiſted in this, that exiſted in paſt ages, "ten thouſand ſwords might have leaped from their ſcab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards, to <hi>avenge even alook</hi> that threatened her with inſult." The high colouring given by Mr. Burke to thoſe ſcenes of regal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, will, I doubt not, captivate the imagination of the greater number of his readers, in a degree equal to the effects produced on the author by the <hi>charms</hi> of the Queen of France. But the <hi>deluſions</hi> of fancy are apt to ſubſide in men of <hi>cool</hi> minds, when any <hi>great</hi> object of publick concern is held up to their view, to the prejudice even of beauty and dignity, and all thoſe external objects, adapted rather to <hi>enſlave</hi> our affections, than to <hi>lead</hi> our judgement.</p>
            <p>The bringing the king and queen to Paris, and thus, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting their eſcape, to diſable them from forming new troubles in the kingdom, was certainly regarded as a meaſure of the <hi>higheſt neceſſity;</hi> and in this view, muſt have been approved by the true friends of the revolution, although it was attended with tumult and diſorder.</p>
            <p>The age in which the ſpirit of chivalry was triumphantly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent, would indeed have been a very <hi>improper</hi> time to have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted a regeneration of conſtitutions on a <hi>popular</hi> principle; but I have always regarded the neceſſity which gave birth to the orders of chivalry, as a mark of <hi>diſgrace</hi> to the times in which they were formed. They were indeed a proper remedy to the evils ariſing from <hi>ferocity, ſlavery, barbariſm,</hi> and <hi>ignorance;</hi> but now, when the cauſes no longer exiſt which rendered them uſeful, we ſhould rather think of <hi>freeing</hi> ſociety of all the evils inherent in thoſe <hi>falſe</hi> notions of honour which they have given riſe to, than en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to call back their ſpirit in its full force. That enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtick military fire, that <hi>methodized ſentimental barbariſm,</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigates men to deprive their fellow citizens of life for <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal affronts, in <hi>defiance</hi> of the laws of <hi>religion</hi> and <hi>ſociety,</hi> are the offsprings of chivalry, and unknown to <hi>all</hi> the nations of the <hi>ancient civilized</hi> world. But it is the <hi>ſimplicity</hi> of all <hi>abſtract principles</hi> againſt which Mr. Burke makes an <hi>eternal</hi> war; all
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:023517_0023_0FBFC2B52B28ACF0"/>
the <hi>devices</hi> of pride, all the <hi>fond conceits</hi> of vanity, all the train of <hi>pompous</hi> oſtentation, by which <hi>naked</hi> virtue is put <hi>out</hi> of her <hi>rank,</hi> to give way to the more impoſing glare of external magnificence, are repreſented as uſeful ideas, "furniſhed from the wardrobe of a <hi>moral</hi> imagination, which the heart owns, and the underſtanding ratifies, as neceſſary to cover the defects of our naked ſhivering nature, and to raiſe it to dignity in our own eſtimation."</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is not,</hi> according to <hi>theſe</hi> ideas, recommended by Mr. Burke, that the Scripture teaches us to <hi>reſpect ourſelves;</hi> and although the maxims of the ſacred writings are exploded by all politicians as <hi>incompatible</hi> with their views, yet certainly the <hi>excellency</hi> of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts conſiſts in their being <hi>exactly</hi> fitted to a <hi>temporal</hi> as well as to a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> happineſs. Neither in a <hi>moral</hi> view of things, can I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how the <hi>ornaments</hi> of artificial greatneſs, which are found to anſwer all the purpoſes of <hi>human pride,</hi> ſhould aſſiſt us in acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>true</hi> dignity of character which <hi>alone</hi> ought to conſtitute diſtinction; nor how we can truly reſpect ourſelves, by <hi>idolizing</hi> the <hi>mere phantom</hi> of greatneſs, whether it be attached to our own perſons, or the perſons of others.</p>
            <p>As every act of the French National Aſſembly is to be <hi>condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> not only in the <hi>groſs,</hi> but in the <hi>detail,</hi> the addreſs of congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the king on the commencement of the preſent year, comes, among others, under Mr. Burke's ſevere animadverſion.</p>
            <p>I have not indeed got this addreſs by me; but if my memory does not deceive me, it contained a language the <hi>beſt</hi> adapted to ſooth the perſonal afflictions of the king. Not the <hi>ſmalleſt</hi> hint was given, than any ill conduct in his Majeſty had provoked t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </hi> him for his concurrence with their wiſhes; it repreſented their liberty as the <hi>neceſſary</hi> conſequence of their <hi>enlightened</hi> ſpirit, not of their ſufferings under his adminiſtration; and it promiſed as loyal an attachment to his perſon, and to the diſtinction he held as the firſt magiſtrate of the commonwealth, as could have been exacted by the authority of which he was diſpoſſeſſed.</p>
            <p>Whatever might have been held out as the oſtenſible object of the people in their demand for the meeting of their repreſentatives, it certainly was intended by them to uſe their power, when thus veſted with a legitimate form, and endued with a capability of legiſlation, not only to the <hi>reformation</hi> of abuſes, but to the <hi>rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration</hi> of their conſtitution; and thus the National Aſſembly became veſted with the truſt of legiſlation, in the <hi>higheſt</hi> ſenſe of the word: Nor could this truſt be <hi>limited</hi> or <hi>governed</hi> by any of thoſe rules and practices, which, for <hi>reaſons</hi> drawn from <hi>experience,</hi> the people <hi>condemned,</hi> and were <hi>determined to aboliſh.</hi>

               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:023517_0024_0FBFC2BB663AF8D8"/>
Thus the preſerving the ſtate from the ruin of an impending bankruptcy, <hi>brought on</hi> by the <hi>prodigality</hi> of courts, and the <hi>rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration</hi> of the conſtitution, were the important ſervices which the National Aſſembly were expected to perform for their conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents. And when we conſider that theſe <hi>important</hi> and <hi>difficult</hi> ſervices were to be performed without that ready and effectual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of power, a <hi>ſtanding</hi> army, (in whom <hi>implicit</hi> obedience is the <hi>only</hi> rule of action), we ſhall be obliged to confeſs, either that the men who undertook this <hi>great</hi> work were infected with a <hi>daring inſanity,</hi> or that they were ſeconded by an <hi>unanimity</hi> in the ſentiments of the people, which is <hi>unparalleled</hi> in the hiſtory of large empires, and which evidently deſtroys the force of <hi>every</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation which can be brought againſt them, as having rendered themſelves the <hi>inſtrument</hi> of a faction, rather than the <hi>faithful</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties of the people.</p>
            <p>A total reformation in the eccleſiaſtical ſyſtem, and the new modelling the ſyſtem of juriſprudence, were the <hi>two leading points</hi> in which <hi>every</hi> member of the empire agreed, excepting thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals whoſe intereſts were perſonally affected by a change. It was a point of union in which both the nobility and the people met; and ſeveral of thoſe perſons who have been the <hi>loudeſt</hi> in their exclamations againſt the conduct of the National Aſſembly, for having <hi>diſappointed</hi> their body of the largeſt ſhare of the <hi>ſpoils of the crown,</hi> and who have ſince united themſelves to the <hi>mal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents</hi> among the lawyers and the clergy, were the moſt active in the firſt movements of theſe grand points of reformation.</p>
            <p>To begin with the reformation of the eccleſiaſtical ſyſtem—It was thought by the French nation, that <hi>one hundred, and four ſcore</hi> millions of property, principally confined to the uſe of the <hi>higher</hi> orders of the clergy, and thus prevented from entering into the common circulation of other parts of property, was a <hi>nuiſance</hi> in a treble ſenſe. It was a <hi>nuiſance,</hi> in the firſt inſtance, as a mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poly; in the ſecond, it was a nuiſance, as giving a dangerous pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to thoſe who poſſeſſed that monopoly, and in the third in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, as it tended, by the <hi>natural courſe</hi> of moral cauſes in this <hi>its exceſs,</hi> to <hi>corrupt</hi> rather than to <hi>encreaſe</hi> and <hi>invigorate</hi> thoſe <hi>qualities of the mind,</hi> and thoſe <hi>ſpiritual endowments,</hi> which are to be deſired in the teachers of religion. What real grounds there were for this opinion, ſo generally conceived by the French na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the conduct of the clergy, I know not; neither ſhall I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, for <hi>I am as little</hi> inclined as Mr. Burke can be to inſult the unfortunate: I ſhall only ſay, that as their temptations were <hi>great,</hi> and that their <hi>nature</hi> was not <hi>ſuperior</hi> to human infirmity, it was <hi>probable</hi> they produced their <hi>due</hi> effects. But there is <hi>one</hi> ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in which I in ſome meaſure accord with Mr. Burke. I do
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:023517_0025_0FBFC2BE0CEB1D18"/>
moſt ſincerely lament that the <hi>exigencies</hi> of the times would <hi>not ſuffer</hi> the National Aſſembly to indulge their clergy in a life-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of their poſſeſſions. But this ſentiment of mine is not of <hi>ſo forcible</hi> a kind as to deſtroy <hi>all other</hi> ſympathies. It would not lead me, even if I poſſeſſed a ſimilar portion of abilities with Mr. Burke, like him, to <hi>endeavour,</hi> by the animating power of declamation, ſo to condole with the ſufferers as to combine all the energies of the <hi>worſt</hi> paſſions of men in favour of my opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion. I ſhould not attempt to <hi>rouſe</hi> and <hi>inflame</hi> the reſentment of the French clergy to a <hi>repetition</hi> of acts which have renewed ſcenes of violence, and by which, after the <hi>manner of old times,</hi> they have ſet up the ſtandard of Chriſt crucified, <hi>to arm bigotry</hi> in favour of <hi>their</hi> pretenſions. Neither ſhould I, among the more peaceable members of that body, by repreſentations the moſt touchingly affecting, open afreſh thoſe wounds on which it is to be hoped <hi>religion has poured her healing balm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>attempt</hi> to make the French National Aſſembly <hi>ſingular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly odious,</hi> for the confiſcations they have made of the church lands, Mr. Burke aſſerts, that in many inſtances they have more violently outraged the principle, as well as the forms of publick juſtice, than has been done by any other preceding power. The examples he brings in proof, are the confiſcations made by the fury of triumphant factions in the Roman commonwealth; and an example more in point in the perſon of Henry the Eighth, for Mr. Burke does <hi>not chuſe</hi> to extend his obſervations to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Denmark, Sweden, and other ſtates, on their profeſſion of the reformed religion. Mr. Burke conſiders the <hi>violences</hi> of Marius and Sylla to be <hi>much graced</hi> in the formalities of <hi>falſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations of treaſon</hi> againſt the <hi>moſt virtuous perſons</hi> in the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; and that the tyrant Henry the Eighth, who ſeized the property of the clergy for his own private uſe, and the emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his favourites, <hi>dignified theſe acts of violence,</hi> by aſſuming the character of the judge, and condemning the victims on <hi>falſe pretences.</hi> Surely the French clergy would not have thought themſelves <hi>better uſed,</hi> if the National Aſſembly had ſet on foot a commiſſion to examine into the crimes and abuſes which prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among them, and then to have governed their proceedings by reported truths, mixed with exaggeration and falſehood; ſurely this <hi>mockery</hi> of juſtice, <hi>ſo much uſed</hi> in old times, and this <hi>covering</hi> to the <hi>deeds</hi> of power, by <hi>ſpoils torn</hi> from the only conſolatory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of the ſufferer, <hi>his good fame,</hi> will not be thought an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>proper</hi> to have been followed, rather than the <hi>plain</hi> dealing of the French legiſlature.</p>
            <p>But Mr. Burke has as great a diſlike to the reform of the church police, as to the confiſcations of the property of the more
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:023517_0026_0FBFC2C17B11B058"/>
dignified part of the order. He is quite in a <hi>rage,</hi> that the <hi>poor curates</hi> ſhould be taken out of the <hi>hopeleſs poverty</hi> into which they were plunged; and he <hi>cannot endure</hi> thoſe regulations which took place in the <hi>beſt</hi> times of Chriſtian ſocieties. That biſhops <hi>ſhould be confined</hi> to their dioceſes, and the <hi>care</hi> of their ſpiritual adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, inſtead of attending courts, and laviſhing their incomes in the pleaſures of the capital; and that the people ſhould aſſume their rights of election; "are ſoleciſms in policy, which none but <hi>barbarous, ignorant, atheiſtical minds</hi> could dictate, and which no man of <hi>enlarged</hi> capacity and <hi>generous</hi> paſſions can obey."</p>
            <p>On that article of the French eccleſiaſtical policy which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines biſhops to their epiſcopal adminiſtration, it may not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to obſerve, that Biſhop Leighton, the <hi>moſt eminent</hi> of the Scotch prelates for his <hi>piety</hi> and his <hi>zeal</hi> for that order, <hi>ardently wiſhed</hi> that ſuch a regulation ſhould take place on their re-eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment in Scotland under Charles the Second. I am far from ſaying that ſuch a regulation is compatible with the ſtate of things among us; and I think ſo well of the moderation of the clergy, and their regard to the conſtitution of the country, that I wiſh they were as <hi>independent</hi> a body as Mr. Burke <hi>repreſents them to be.</hi> But ſurely if <hi>gratitude</hi> for <hi>paſt favours,</hi> the <hi>hopes</hi> held out to <hi>am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition</hi> for the acquiring <hi>further preferments,</hi> and a very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble number of church-livings in the <hi>diſpoſal</hi> of the crown, <hi>can in any reſpect</hi> influence the minds of the clergy, they cannot be ſaid to be <hi>totally</hi> independent.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now take into conſideration the ſecond grand point of reformation, in which the nobles and people appear at firſt to have been in union, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> the <hi>new</hi> modelling the ſyſtem of juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence; but that a ſyſtem of juriſprudence, formed by <hi>ignorant barbarians,</hi> from codes of law adapted to ſupport the <hi>deſpotic ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny</hi> of the <hi>Roman Emperors,</hi> could not be in uniſon with the ſentiments of an enlightened people, or capable of ſupporting the principles of a <hi>free</hi> government, was apparent to all parties: But perſonal intereſt, for reaſons as apparent, at length produced an union between the lawyers and nobles. The National Aſſembly <hi>juſtly</hi> thought, that laws dictated by the <hi>humane</hi> ſpirit of an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened age, would be but <hi>ill</hi> adminiſtered by a tribunal formed under the influence of the <hi>rankeſt</hi> prejudices; and they conceived it as a <hi>ſoleciſm</hi> in polities, that Parliaments, who had been eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally appointed to ſee that the laws and regulations framed by the Aſſemblies of the States General, ſhould receive no injury from the edicts of the monarch, ſhould be kept as a control over the ſtanding authority of the nation. It was on this reaſon that the old independent Parliaments with all their merits, and all their faults, were aboliſhed. Nor is it a wonder that in the change
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:023517_0027_0FBFC2C42BB4EB48"/>
of the <hi>proſpect,</hi> a change in the <hi>ſentiments</hi> of the nobles ſhould have taken place: For when they perceived that the ſyſtem of the ancient tyranny was <hi>better</hi> adapted to their <hi>perſonal</hi> greatneſs than the <hi>new order</hi> of things, they with Mr. Burke, looked on the Parliaments as a <hi>convenient</hi> power, under which they might rally. What a <hi>ready convenience</hi> for the play of a <hi>deluſive</hi> policy would it have afforded, if the Parliaments, exerting their <hi>old</hi> authority un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the crown, had pertinaciouſly refuſed to regiſter the edicts of the Aſſembly! What a diſplay of eloquence <hi>in favour</hi> of the <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges</hi> of the <hi>nobles</hi> and the <hi>clergy,</hi> might have been ſeen in their <hi>remonſtrances</hi> to the Aſſembly! and what <hi>uſeful</hi> delays would it have afforded for the preſident of the National Aſſembly, in the name of the Majeſty of the people, to have been obliged to mount the Bed of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> after the example of the late monarchs of the realm; and in caſe of an <hi>incurable</hi> obſtinacy, for the Aſſembly, through the means of the executive power, to have recourſe to the <hi>tedious</hi> remedy of an impriſonment. With ſuch advantages on their ſide, the <hi>faction</hi> in oppoſition would have had <hi>reaſonable</hi> grounds of hope, that <hi>centuries</hi> might have elapſed before the conſtitution could have been in any ſenſe of the word regen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erated.</p>
            <p>Before I leave this ſubject, it will be neceſſary to notice, that Mr. Burke <hi>condemns</hi> the conduct of the National Aſſembly for the diſtinction they have made in their treatment of the lawyers and their clergy, a diſtinction which I think every unprejudiced perſon will agree to be founded in juſtice, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> the preference af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded the former by making them a ſuitable proviſion during life, in conſideration that the civil offices, of which they were deprived, had been purchaſed with private property (as Mr. Burke obſerves) "at an high rate."</p>
            <p>The prevention of a national bankruptcy was thought an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the moſt <hi>momentous</hi> concern to the whole French nation. It was in order to avert this <hi>impending</hi> evil, that the States Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral were permitted to aſſemble; and it was an object <hi>principally</hi> recommended to the deputies of the people, by their united voice. In this ſtate of publick opinion, the arguments ſo plauſibly, and indeed ſo forcibly urged by Mr. Burke <hi>againſt the right</hi> of the monarch to mortgage the public revenue, will not render the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly culpable for <hi>endeavouring</hi> to <hi>keep faith</hi> with the creditors of the crown. For though I never could perceive why on any <hi>good grounds of reaſon,</hi> the people ſhould <hi>quarrel</hi> with their new conſtitution, becauſe the <hi>prodigality</hi> of the <hi>old government</hi> had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved them in <hi>diſtreſſes</hi> which were in their nature irremoveable, which did not proceed from any <hi>fraud</hi> or <hi>corruption</hi> in their <hi>new</hi> ſervants, and which could not be mended by ſubjecting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

to the <hi>old</hi> domination; yet certain it is, that the <hi>enemies</hi> of the new conſtitution have beheld the arrival of a moment big with that temporary diſtreſs and confuſion which muſt ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a national bankruptry, with the <hi>utmoſt impatience,</hi> as of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with it a <hi>ſure</hi> proſpect of <hi>victory.</hi> What an <hi>opportunity</hi> indeed, would it preſent, of ſetting forth <hi>exaggerated</hi> deſcriptions of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic diſtreſſes, and of arraigning the members of the National Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly as the <hi>ſole</hi> authors of the nation's wrongs! The <hi>anxious</hi> and <hi>provident</hi> care which this Aſſembly has taken to ward off this diſaſter, and alſo to avoid, in the preſent irritable ſtate of the public feelings, the impoſing very heavy burthens on the people, is certainly a mark of political <hi>ſagacity,</hi> and, <hi>being ſuch,</hi> is treated with the <hi>utmoſt bitterneſs of diſappointed rage</hi> by their opponents.</p>
            <p>On the ſubject of the difficulties which the French Legiſlature have encountered in the taſk of regenerating the conſtitution, it is natural to turn our minds on the <hi>paper-currency</hi> they have eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, and eſpecially as it is a ſubject on which Mr. Burke has diſplayed the <hi>whole force</hi> of his ingenuity, to alarm the fears of the French nation, and to depreciate, and to render odious in their eyes, the conduct of their repreſentatives.</p>
            <p>On this ſubject I do profeſs a total ignorance: I have no fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanciering abilities; and I wiſh with all my heart, that this art which Mr. Burke repreſents as a talent the <hi>moſt highly</hi> neceſſary in thoſe who conduct the affairs of ſtate, and which I conſider as deriving its practical uſe from its <hi>deceptious</hi> addreſs in <hi>picking the pockets</hi> of the people, was not ſo neceſſary an engine in the preſent modes of adminiſtration. A few obſervations however, which muſt occur to every thinking mind, I ſhall venture to make. They are as follows: That the difference which Mr. Burke makes between the paper currency of this country, and that which now ſubſiſts in France, is not <hi>ſo much</hi> in favour of England as Mr. Burke repreſents; for, as the French legiſlature have <hi>not</hi> iſſued more paper than they appear to have a <hi>ſolid fund to ſupport,</hi> and a fund that is <hi>obvious</hi> to every man's eyes and underſtanding, its credit <hi>ought not in reaſon</hi> to have leſs ſtability than a paper cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency founded on <hi>confidence.</hi> For, though every man believes, and on good grounds believes, that the bank of England has a ſufficient property to anſwer for the payment of its notes; yet ſtill although <hi>this belief</hi> ſhould ariſe to a <hi>moral certainty,</hi> it cannot be <hi>ſuperior</hi> to a credit founded on an <hi>obvious</hi> fact. And ſhould the French legiſlature continue this <hi>wiſe</hi> caution, of not iſſuing more paper than the ſtate revenue can obviouſly ſupport, whilſt the revolution ſtands on its <hi>preſent</hi> bottom, this paper, <hi>whatever may be</hi> the exigencies of the times, muſt <hi>always</hi> be of <hi>ſome value;</hi> whereas a failure of our national credit would, it is generally
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:023517_0029_0FBFC2CA020D8728"/>
thought, render the paper money of this country of <hi>no more worth than the intrinſic value of the paper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The diffuſion of a general ſpirit of gaming, and the deſtructive practice of ſtock jobbing, <hi>are evils</hi> which I am a fraid in a more or leſs degree muſt ever exiſt with national debts; and the <hi>larger</hi> the debt, the <hi>greater</hi> will be <hi>the degree</hi> of evil. That this ſpirit prevails in our capital to a very alarming height, the hiſtory of the <hi>Bulls</hi> and <hi>Bears</hi> in the alley will <hi>abundantly</hi> teſtify: That it has been the <hi>ruin</hi> of many a fair fortune, <hi>thouſands of ſufferers</hi> can alſo teſtify: That it has <hi>enabled</hi> and <hi>tempted ſeveral</hi> of thoſe who are in the <hi>ſecret</hi> of affairs, to <hi>pillage</hi> the publick unmercifully, ſame repreſents; and that the ſtocks have a <hi>great</hi> influence over the landed property of this country, which riſes or falls according to their various fluctuations, the experience of the laſt American war <hi>evinces beyond a doubt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All theſe evils, if evils they are, were <hi>prognoſticated</hi> by thoſe who ſtiled themſelves the patriots of their country, from the <hi>firſt</hi> eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment of a funded debt, to almoſt the preſent period of time; and the reaſons they urged to enforce the arguments they uſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the meaſure, appear to me ſufficiently convincing to have induced a <hi>cautious moderation</hi> in our councils. But they were not attended to; they were repreſented as the <hi>chimeras of diſcontented ſpeculative men;</hi> the <hi>encreaſe</hi> of the national debt was ſet forth as both the <hi>cauſe</hi> and the <hi>effects</hi> of public <hi>proſperity;</hi> it was deſcribed as the <hi>enlivening</hi> principle of commerce, the <hi>grand pan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ea</hi> that was to keep us in an <hi>eternal vigour,</hi> the <hi>ſteady hold</hi> by which all the members of the community were to be <hi>bound</hi> in the bands of loyalty; and that there was <hi>no exceſs</hi> in the amount of the debt, that could be attended with <hi>any ruinous</hi> conſequences.</p>
            <p>If ſuch repreſentations, ſo repeatedly made by a large party in the kingdom, and at preſent ſo generally adopted, are founded in truth, I cannot ſee how <hi>cauſes</hi> which have a <hi>ſalutary effect</hi> among us, ſhould operate as <hi>poiſon</hi> to our neighbours; and I have a <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> opinion of the policy of the National Aſſembly in iſſuing their <hi>aſſignats,</hi> from the <hi>ſtrong</hi> and <hi>violent oppoſition</hi> which was made to the meaſure by their <hi>enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It muſt not be forgot, that among the other economical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations of the National Aſſembly, that which has taken place in their <hi>liſt</hi> of <hi>penſioners,</hi> falls equally with other of their acts, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſeverity of Mr. Burke's pen. The amount of the public money given to this deſcription of people by the court, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>enormous;</hi> and if we may give credit to the <hi>Red Book,</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by authority, there was <hi>little</hi> of the principles of <hi>reaſon</hi> or <hi>juſtice</hi> in the admeaſurement of rewards to individuals, unleſs the <hi>ſtate</hi> and the <hi>country</hi> are conſidered as <hi>ſeparate intereſts</hi> in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count;
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:023517_0030_0FBFC2CCC63635C0"/>
and that the pleaſing or gratifying the <hi>prince</hi> and his <hi>favourites</hi> ſhould be reckoned in the value of an <hi>hundred pounds</hi> to a <hi>penny,</hi> when ſet in the balance of <hi>blood ſhed</hi> in <hi>defence</hi> of the <hi>nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What indeed can eſcape Mr. Burke's cenſure, or what act of the French legiſlature can pleaſe him, (but the diſſolving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and leaving the king and the nobles to form their own rules of power), when he finds ſubject for <hi>reproach</hi> even in their acts of <hi>ſympathy</hi> to the <hi>indigent</hi> part of the <hi>citizens?</hi> That Paris was always crowded with a numerous herd of mendicants, even more numerous, if poſſible, than thoſe who infeſt and diſgrace our capital, is certain; and ſhould their numbers have encreaſed by the deſertion of thoſe opulent citizens who are out of temper with the government, it would neither be a <hi>ſurprizing</hi> nor an <hi>alarming</hi> circumſtance: But it is an evil that time alone can cure, when the ſhock of ſo important a revolution has ſpent its force, and when the <hi>ill humour</hi> which at preſent rages in the breaſts of the diſcontented ſhall ſubſide, and lead them to return into the boſom of their country, and under the protecting laws of a regular gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment.</p>
            <p>In a very elaborate defence of all the artificial modes of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which have taken place in ſociety, Mr. Burke has uſed all the powers of eloquence and ſubtlety to prove, that the crimes which have been committed by our ſpecies, have not ariſen from the imperfections of inſtitutions, but from the vices of individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als. In <hi>one ſenſe,</hi> his argument will be found to be <hi>juſt,</hi> in <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, nugatory:</hi> For though it muſt be acknowledged, that the crimes committed by Nero proceeded from the depravity of his character, yet the <hi>opportunity</hi> of committing thoſe crimes, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps that very <hi>depravity</hi> of ſentiment from whence they proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, lay in the <hi>vice</hi> of the <hi>imperial inſtitution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With the ſame flow of eloquence, and the ſame ſubtlety, Mr. Burke recommends in all legiſlators, that <hi>tardy</hi> caution which ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers the <hi>ſpirit of reform to evaporate</hi> before their work is half finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; "for the evils latent in the moſt promiſing contrivances," ſays Mr. Burke, "ſhould be provided for as they ariſe; one ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage is as little as poſſible to be ſacrificed to another; for thus we compenſate, we reconcile, we balance, we are enabled to unite in a conſiſtant whole, the various anomalies and contending prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples that are found in the minds and affairs of men."</p>
            <p>This <hi>finely</hi> imagined theory would undoubtedly be adopted by all wiſe and good legiſlators, did it in any manner ſuit with the <hi>nature</hi> of mankind, and that <hi>leaven</hi> of <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> which taints <hi>every principle</hi> of human conduct. That perfect knowledge of human affairs, which Mr. Burke conceives, and juſtly conceives, ought to be inſeparable from the office of legiſlation, will convince men,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:023517_0031_0FBFC2CE2F073710"/>
that when new conſtitutions are to be formed, it is neceſſary they ſhould, in their formation, be regulated in all their circumſtances by thoſe principles which the legiſlators conceive to be <hi>the beſt;</hi> for if any thing which may be thought <hi>defective</hi> is left for the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of future legiſlators to <hi>correct,</hi> the conſtitution muſt <hi>remain defective,</hi> as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uture reformers will find their <hi>difficulties encreaſe,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being <hi>diminiſhed,</hi> by time. The reaſon is plain; for that which conſtitutes the <hi>defects</hi> in all governments, are thoſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in them which ſupport a <hi>partial intereſt,</hi> to the injury of a <hi>public one;</hi> and the <hi>preſcription of time</hi> with the <hi>politic uſe of power,</hi> has been found an <hi>irreſiſtible barrier</hi> to every important part <hi>of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi> in the ordinary courſe of things.</p>
            <p>The French legiſlature, in order to extinguiſh thoſe local pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices and provincial jealouſies which formerly exiſted in the kingdom of France, ariſing from the different laws and cuſtoms which took place when the independent principalities were annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the crown; and alſo to regulate the rights of election in ſuch a manner, as whilſt it ſecured to the citizens at large this invalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able bleſſing, it ſhould provide for the public tranquillity; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and executed a plan of dividing the kingdom into eighty one departments. Each of theſe departments are divided into ſmaller diſtricts, called <hi>Communes;</hi> and theſe again into ſmaller diſtricts, called <hi>Cantons.</hi> The primary aſſemblies of the <hi>cantons</hi> elect deputies to the <hi>communes,</hi> one for every two hundred qualified inhabitants. The <hi>communes</hi> choſen by the <hi>cantons</hi> chuſe to the <hi>departments,</hi> and the deputies of the <hi>departments</hi> chuſe the deputies to the <hi>National Aſſembly.</hi> A qualification to the right of election in the firſt inſtance, is placed at the low rate of the price of three days labour; the qualification of being elected into the <hi>Commune,</hi> is the amount of ten days labour; and that of being elected a deputy to the <hi>National Aſſembly,</hi> is only <hi>one</hi> mark of ſilver.</p>
            <p>This plan, in theory at leaſt, promiſes to unite the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of <hi>freedom</hi> with the higheſt degree of <hi>order:</hi> it extends the right of election <hi>to every man who is not a pauper,</hi> and as ſuch by living on the <hi>alms</hi> of ſociety, cannot reaſonably have a <hi>right</hi> to enjoy its po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical privileges; and whilſt it thus encourages induſtry, by ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering it a neceſſary quality to enjoy theſe privileges, it opens the door to every man of ability to obtain the higheſt honours of his country. But this plan, ſo plauſible at leaſt in its appearance, and ſo exactly agreeing with the rights of the citizens in the <hi>ſtricteſt ſenſe</hi> of the word, is criticiſed by Mr. Burke in a manner <hi>highly unworthy</hi> of his great abilities, becauſe he deſcends to the <hi>arts</hi> of a quibbling ſophiſtry. He accuſes the legiſlature of not attending to their avowed principles of the equal rights of men, in <hi>refuſing</hi> their <hi>paupers</hi> a vote. He aſſerts that the right of election granted
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:023517_0032_0FBFC2D066123F10"/>
in the firſt inſtance, is no previlege at all; and he foreſees, that the moſt <hi>fatal diſſenſions</hi> will ariſe from regulations which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly tend to <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> every jarring principle in the ſtate, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due every prejudice of the mind hoſtile to the publick welfare, and to combine all its affections in the character of a loyal ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen.</p>
            <p>In oppoſition to Mr. Burke's accuſation, that the legiſlature, in the qualifications they have annexed to the rights of election, have acted in contradiction to their avowed principles of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual rights of men, I ſhall, without ſheltering myſelf under the cover of a practical uſe, (which may be uſed to juſtify every mode of tyranny,) aſſert, that the French legiſlature have in thoſe quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications adhered to the rights of men in the <hi>ſtricteſt ſenſe,</hi> even as they exiſt in their <hi>abſtract</hi> perfection in a ſtate of nature: For, who ever conceived, that, in a ſtate of nature, a man who was either not inclined, or by bodily infirmity not able, to till the ground, had a right to the fruits produced by the labour of oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers? In this caſe, either in a ſtate of nature, or in a ſtate of ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, the <hi>right</hi> of maintenance depends alone on the <hi>laws of human<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity,</hi> proceeding from that ſympathy which the benevolent Author of our being has for the <hi>beſt purpoſes</hi> woven into the mental con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of all his <hi>moral</hi> creatures. But theſe laws of humanity do not oblige men to yield rights with the <hi>donation of alms,</hi> and to put thoſe whom their charity has relieved, into a ſituation of <hi>forcing</hi> from them the fruits of their induſtry. It is on the baſis of <hi>induſtry</hi> alone, the <hi>only</hi> principle which exactly ſquares with a native right, and <hi>not on rent-rolls,</hi> that the legiſlature has formed the rights of repreſentation; and this on ſuch liberal principles, that every man who has activity and induſtry, may qualify him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as to the matter of property, for a ſeat in the legiſlative aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. As to the nature and operation of the privileges annexed to the firſt and ſecond ſteps in the gradation, I conceive that the regular degrees, which directly point to the grand privilege of chuſing the repreſentatives, whilſt they totally prevent <hi>confuſion</hi> and the errors of a <hi>blind</hi> choice, do not, in <hi>any</hi> reſpect, render <hi>nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory</hi> the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ight of its more <hi>abſtract</hi> principle. For every man in the Canton makes <hi>his choice</hi> of a deputy whom he thinks qualified by merit to repreſent him in the Commune, and <hi>every</hi> voter in the Commune has alſo <hi>his choice</hi> of a deputy to preſent him in the department, who have a right to the choice of repreſentatives.</p>
            <p>As Mr. Burke has made it a point to object to <hi>every</hi> part of the French conſtitution as it now ſtands, and to every act of the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature which reſpects this conſtitution, I muſt follow him through all his objections, and ſtate thoſe reaſons which appear to me to have regulated their conduct. It is true that a ſenate, or
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:023517_0033_0FBFC2D1E4CABF38"/>
an aſſembly of men who have had ſome control over the voice of the people, ſome power of mitigating, regulating, or carrying into execution their laws, has always had a place in the ancient republics: But Mr. Burke himſelf ſeems to allow, that they are not <hi>abſolutely</hi> neceſſary in monarchies, or rather in any govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which admits of a <hi>ſtanding permanent</hi> executive power. It is true they appear to have been a neceſſary inſtitution in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient republics; yet hiſtory will ſhew us, that their tendency has ever been <hi>hoſtile</hi> to the principles of democracy, and often ended in the <hi>ruin</hi> of freedom. To the <hi>pride,</hi> the <hi>avarice,</hi> and <hi>corruption</hi> of the Roman Senate, was undoubtedly owing the ſubverſion of the republic. It is, I think, very little to the purpoſe of enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening men's minds on the ſubject of modern government, to quote the reflections of ancient authors, or draw compariſons from ancient times, which were totally unacquainted with that <hi>excellent</hi> policy, by which the people's power is repreſented, and brought into regular action through the means of deputation. An Aſſembly of men <hi>thus appointed,</hi> ſeems to unite in it all the energy and fitneſs to the affairs of government of the Roman Senate, in its moſt brilliant and perfect ſtate, without the <hi>latent</hi> principles of <hi>corruption</hi> and <hi>deſtruction</hi> which lurked in this inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
            <p>What Lord Bolingbroke could mean I know not, when he ſays, that he prefers a monarchy to other governments; becauſe every deſcription of a republic can be better engrafted on it, than any thing of a monarchy upon the republican forms; unleſs he refers to ſuch a <hi>qualified</hi> monarchy as is confined to the <hi>mere</hi> office of an executive governor, with the <hi>ſtability</hi> that is annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>hereditary deſcent;</hi> for ſure it is <hi>impoſſible</hi> to engraft a demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy on any other deſcription of monarchy. If this is his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's meaning, the French monarchy, as it now ſtands, will be found to agree <hi>perfectly</hi> with it; and ſhould experience prove it to be defective for the want of ſuch a member as a ſenate, the defect muſt be ſupplied with all thoſe <hi>cautious</hi> preventatives which experience can alone afford.</p>
            <p>The <hi>limitations</hi> of power, in which the executive magiſtrate is confined, affords Mr. Burke a ſubject for the exertion of <hi>all</hi> the powers of his oratory. He <hi>deplores</hi> the mortified ſtate of the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len monarch; he ſees nothing but <hi>weakneſs</hi> in the government, and <hi>confuſion</hi> in the affairs of the empire; from the want of a <hi>proper influencing power in the executive, and that cordiality which ought to ſubſiſt between it and the legiſlative.</hi> He conceives, that without ſuch a <hi>controling</hi> influence, the executive office is a ſtate of <hi>degradation,</hi> to which <hi>no man of ſpirit</hi> would ſubmit. And if the preſent King and his ſucceſſors reſpect their <hi>true</hi> glory, they
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:023517_0034_0FBFC2D52A576E88"/>
will take <hi>every</hi> opportunity which time may preſent, of ſhaking off the yoke of their imperious maſters, and reſuming their former independence.</p>
            <p>To theſe animadverſions of Mr. Burke, it may be obſerved, that moſt of the limitations of which he complains, are either <hi>inſeparable</hi> to the ſecurity of the democracy, or they have their grounds in a <hi>juſt policy,</hi> ſuiting itſelf to the preſent ſtate of things. It is neceſſary that a popular legiſlature ſhould be informed through <hi>other channels</hi> than the <hi>executive power,</hi> of ſuch matters as may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that body to know: It is neceſſary that all the means by which <hi>a perſonal influence</hi> may be eſtabliſhed by the <hi>grant of lands</hi> and <hi>large penſions,</hi> ſhould be taken away; and for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of policy, it is neceſſary that the executive power <hi>ſhould not</hi> be capable of <hi>deluding the imaginations</hi> of men, by creating <hi>artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial diſtinctions</hi> among them.</p>
            <p>According to Mr. Burke's political creed, Kings are only to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect thoſe</hi> who ſerve their <hi>perſonal greatneſs;</hi> and it is his opinion, that the ſucceſſors to the throne of France in the Bourbon line, <hi>muſt,</hi> unleſs they are <hi>illiterate men,</hi> act on a principle <hi>hoſtile</hi> to the conſtitution which <hi>they are ſworn</hi> to preſerve. It is true, as Mr. Burke obſerves, this is <hi>nature;</hi> but are not thoſe very <hi>inclinations,</hi> ſo inherent in man, the grounds for that <hi>jealouſy</hi> which reflecting patriots entertain <hi>of all perſons</hi> veſted with the dangerous gift of <hi>permanent</hi> authority? And unleſs the preſent monarch of France, and his ſucceſſors, ſhall conceive <hi>very different ideas of glory</hi> than they will <hi>learn</hi> from Mr. Burke; unleſs they ſhall conceive that the executing an office <hi>faithfully,</hi> reflects <hi>more honour</hi> upon them than any encreaſe of <hi>perſonal greatneſs</hi> they can gain by <hi>treachery;</hi> there is very little probability that they will obtain from a popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar legiſlature, that enlargement of power<note n="*" place="bottom">The exerciſe of the ſuſpenſive <hi>Veto.</hi>
               </note> which may reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be given, when circumſtances ſhall <hi>convince</hi> the public mind that there are no grounds for jealouſy.</p>
            <p>Mr. Burke extends his <hi>commiſeration not only</hi> to the perſon of the King and his royal iſſue, but <hi>even</hi> to the miniſters of the crown in their civil capacity. In this commiſeration, he <hi>reprobates</hi> a principle which is held out to the people of Great Britain as the grand <hi>palladium</hi> of their liberties, I mean the principle of reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility; though the reprobation is indeed qualified by a diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>active</hi> and <hi>zealous</hi> ſervice, and the reſtraint of crimes. But it is a diſtinction which I cannot well underſtand; for if reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility does not go to every part of a miniſter's conduct, in which he acts without due authority, it is indeed a <hi>very</hi> ſlight conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional barrier againſt the <hi>vices</hi> of adminiſtration, eſpecially when it is allowed among the prerogatives of our Kings, that they may
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:023517_0035_0FBFC2D9BAA09738"/>
chuſe their own ſervants, and retain them in their office at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: but will any miniſter who ſerves ſuch a King (ſays Mr. Burke, when ſpeaking of the preſent King of France) with but a decent appearance of reſpect, <hi>cordially</hi> obey the orders of thoſe whom but the other day in his name they had committed to the Baſtile? Will they obey the orders of thoſe whom, whilſt they were exerciſing <hi>deſpotick juſtice</hi> upon them, they conceived they were treating with <hi>lenity,</hi> and for whom, in a <hi>priſon,</hi> they thought they had provided an <hi>aſylum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is ſaying <hi>very little,</hi> either for the diſpoſition of the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters, or for the <hi>ſpirit</hi> and <hi>principles</hi> of the ancient government. Nor can I ſee that theſe gentlemen have any <hi>reaſonable</hi> complaints to make againſt the conduct of the French legiſlature. It is true they are denied a ſeat amongſt them; but this exception is not made on any <hi>perſonal</hi> ground: They do not except againſt the abilities of theſe gentlemen, or their honeſty as individuals; but they will <hi>not</hi> permit, either a <hi>real,</hi> or a <hi>ſuppoſed influence,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trol their own actions. They will not permit that the ſanctuary, in which the Majeſty of the people of France reſides, ſhould be <hi>polluted</hi> or <hi>impeached</hi> by any <hi>ſuſpicion of corruption;</hi> and they will not endanger the liberties of their country, by giving <hi>abſolute pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er any motive,</hi> which, in the event of things, may poſſibly tend to an <hi>abuſe</hi> of <hi>truſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The opinion which Mr. Burke endeavours to eſtabliſh in his elaborate Reflections on the French Revolution, is the <hi>incompat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ibility</hi> of a truly popular government with the human conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And the ſubject which affords him the moſt ample ſcope for the diſplay of his argumentative powers, is found in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtment of that military force which is neceſſary to the ſupport of all governments; for if that force is truſted to the people at large, they may be tempted to act in their natural capacity, and, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying or weakening the energy of thoſe organs by which regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar councils are held and enforced, induce a ſtate of anarchy. And if the ſupport of the government is made to ſubſiſt in a reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular ſtanding diſciplined body, under the control of an individ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual, that individual will become the <hi>maſter of the people,</hi> and <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> the government he was appointed to <hi>defend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Either the eſtabliſhment or the overthrow of an opinion ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to the proud hopes of man, muſt be left to time and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; for I am ſorry to ſay, that we have no notices on which we can attempt the conſtruction of an oppoſite argument. We cannot venture to eſtabliſh an opinion on the ſtate of a country not yet recovered from the convulſive ſtruggles which every im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant revolution muſt occaſion. We can gain no light from
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:023517_0036_0FBFC2DC5A529620"/>
hiſtory; for hiſtory furniſhes <hi>no example</hi> of any government in a large empire, which, in the ſtricteſt ſenſe of the word, has ſecur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the citizen the <hi>full</hi> enjoyment of his rights. Some at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts indeed have been made of this kind; but they have hith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erto failed, through the <hi>treachery</hi> of leaders, or by the <hi>raſh folly</hi> of the multitude. But though theſe circumſtances will prevent cautious perſons from giving a <hi>decided</hi> opinion on what may be the event of things, yet they do not ſo <hi>benight</hi> the underſtanding as to deprive the mind of hope. They do not prevent it from ſeeing that the preſent complexion of things in France has ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a different aſpect from what hiſtory, or the ſtate of other countries, preſents to our view. Inſtead of that <hi>barbarous ignor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi> or that <hi>depravity</hi> of <hi>principle,</hi> which are to be ſeen in other European States, and which might reaſonably prevent the patriot from beſtowing (if it were in his power) the full boon of liberty, we ſee a people <hi>firm</hi> and <hi>united</hi> in their efforts to <hi>ſupport</hi> their rights, yet obedient<note n="*" place="bottom"> Mr. Burke acknowledges this obedience, and calls it <hi>fanaticiſm.</hi>
               </note> to the dictates of that government which they have appointed to defend them.</p>
            <p>From what can this difference which ſubſiſts between the French nation and other ſocieties ariſe, but in a more <hi>general</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of <hi>knowledge,</hi> and in a principle of action which conſults the <hi>public</hi> good, as well as the gratifications of <hi>ſelf?</hi> It is the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>knowledge</hi> to teach men their <hi>real intereſts;</hi> and it is to be hoped it will ſo far prevail over that <hi>miſt</hi> which <hi>inordinate</hi> affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions caſt over the mind, as to enable the French municipalities to ſee, that if they ſo far <hi>abuſe</hi> the power with which they have been inveſted for the defence of their rights, as to gratify a <hi>private</hi> paſſion at the expenſe of the <hi>public</hi> peace, they will induce a <hi>neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> which will lead to their <hi>utter</hi> deſtruction. It is to be hoped alſo, that a <hi>true</hi> ſenſe of intereſt will enable the army to perceive, that the <hi>moment they fling off the character of the citizen, and aſſume a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troling power over their country,</hi> from that moment they become <hi>individually ſlaves;</hi> for the very circumſtance in their condition by which this power muſt ſubſiſt, is a diſcipline inſeparable to the <hi>ſtricteſt ſubordination,</hi> and which in <hi>all</hi> reſpects muſt militate againſt their civil rights. When the Roman army was in the very height of their power; when it was enabled to depoſe and murder em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, and raiſe private men to the imperial throne; when they were enabled to ravage the empire at their pleaſure, and exact lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes from its ſpoils; they were, in an <hi>individual</hi> capacity, the <hi>greateſt</hi> of ſlaves.</p>
            <p>The patriot Frenchman has a proſpect of hope which <hi>never</hi> yet
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:023517_0037_0FBFC2E34B4A2EB8"/>
offered itſelf to the view of ſociety, and that is in the <hi>diſintereſtedneſs</hi> of thoſe councils to which he has confided his right. The repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican parliament of England, by their <hi>inordinate</hi> thirſt after public offices, and by uſing their power to their <hi>own emolument,</hi> gave <hi>too much room</hi> for the ſuſpicions of a divided people to act in their disfavour; and it muſt be acknowledged, that the intereſts of ſelf have been obſerved to act as much in popular councils as in courts. But the French legiſlature have ſet, in this point, an example <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parellelled</hi> in the hiſtory of man. To a <hi>bold</hi> and <hi>enterpriſing</hi> ſpirit, they have united a <hi>diſintereſtedneſs</hi> of principle which has deprived their enemies of <hi>every</hi> means of oppoſition, but <hi>vain</hi> declamation, <hi>groundleſs</hi> accuſation, and <hi>impotent</hi> hope. Long may they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the <hi>admiration</hi> of the world in theſe important particulars! Long may they thus continue to <hi>aggrandize</hi> the character of man! And long may they continue to deſerve a <hi>monument of eſteem</hi> on the minds of their ſpecies, which neither <hi>time,</hi> nor <hi>accident,</hi> nor <hi>adverſe fortune, ſhall be able to efface!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It cannot be denied that Mr. Burke has made a diſplay of very <hi>uncommon</hi> abilities in his attack on the French Revolution; but why has he deigned to make uſe of the <hi>mean arts</hi> of abuſe as an <hi>auxiliary</hi> in the conteſt? Why has he, by the moſt <hi>invidious</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons, and <hi>groundleſs</hi> accuſations, endeavoured, to rouſe all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and all deſcriptions of men againſt them, and thus to <hi>cruſh in their ruin all the rights of man?</hi> Is the tendency of his publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a <hi>recommendation</hi> to the Britiſh government, to dragoon their neighbours into an adoption of their own ſyſtem of policy? Would he recommend to the potentates of Europe, a renewal of that <hi>wicked conſpiracy</hi> againſt the rights of men, which was plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Henry the fourth and his miniſter Sully, and which was only prevented from taking place by the timely death of that monarch?—a plan, by which, through the <hi>combination</hi> of power, modes of government were to be <hi>arbitrarily</hi> impoſed and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, and the rights of conſcience <hi>aboliſhed.</hi> If ſuch <hi>violent</hi> councils were indeed to take place of that <hi>moderation</hi> and <hi>equity</hi> which has hitherto been ſhewn, it would <hi>prove</hi> that the <hi>forming treaties</hi> and directing the <hi>force of nations</hi> were but <hi>ill</hi> truſted to the <hi>ſecrecy</hi> of cabinets. When we reflect that ſuch dreadful purpoſes can never be effected without the effuſion of <hi>oceans</hi> of blood, of ſuch an invidious intention we muſt certainly exculpate Mr. Burke; unleſs, by a <hi>ſtrange</hi> modification of <hi>ſympathy,</hi> the lives of plebeians, and thoſe vulgar characters which compoſe the <hi>"ſwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh multitude,"</hi> is held at <hi>no value</hi> in his account. Some of Mr. Burke's expreſſions, indeed, ſeem to warrant us in making ſuch a ſuppoſition, though we <hi>muſt acknowledge,</hi> that, in others,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:023517_0038_0FBFC2E55C81E9A0"/>
he appears to have a <hi>concern</hi> for the <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> if not for the <hi>temporal</hi> happineſs of thoſe he deſpiſes: "Whilſt, ſays he, the wealth and pride of individuals at every moment makes the man of humble rank and fortune ſenſible of his inferiority, and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grades</hi> and <hi>vilifies</hi> his condition<note n="*" place="bottom">This is a ſad condition, indeed, for <hi>"naked ſhivering nature:"</hi> But what is the remedy? why, let them reſpect property, and ſeek "their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation in the final proportions of eternal juſtice." <hi>Vide</hi> Reflections, pages 147 and 351.</note>; it is for the man in humble life, and to raiſe his nature, and to put him in mind of a ſtate in which the privileges of opulence will ceaſe, when he will be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual by nature, and may be more than equal by virtue, that this portion of the general wealth of his country is employed, and ſanctified."</p>
            <p>If Mr. Burke, in the management of his argument, could have deſcended from the <hi>lofty</hi> ſtrain of a <hi>poetic</hi> imagination, to the <hi>drud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery</hi> of cloſe reaſoning, he would have perceived the <hi>error</hi> of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viating from the line of <hi>expediency</hi> into the queſtion of <hi>right;</hi> for when we once <hi>give up</hi> the point, that there is an <hi>inherent</hi> right attached to privileged perſons to make laws for the community, we cannot fix on any other principle that will ſtand the teſt of argument, but the <hi>native</hi> and <hi>unalienable</hi> rights of man. For if we ſay that <hi>lawful</hi> governments are formed on the authority of conventions, it will be aſked, <hi>who gave theſe conventions their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority?</hi> If we grant that they derived their authority from the <hi>aſſent of the people,</hi> how came the people, it will be ſaid, to exert ſuch an authority at <hi>one</hi> period of ſociety, and not at <hi>another?</hi> If we ſay it was <hi>neceſſity</hi> that recovered to the ſocial man the full rights of his nature, it will be aſked, <hi>who is to be the judge</hi> of this neceſſity? why <hi>certainly</hi> the people.</p>
            <p>Thus, in <hi>every</hi> light in which we can place the argument, in every poſſible mode of reaſoning, we ſhall be driven back to elect either the firſt or the ſecond of theſe propoſitions; either that an individual, or ſome privileged perſons, have an inherent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defeaſible right to make laws for the community, or that this authority reſts in the unalienable and indefeaſible rights of man.</p>
            <p>That the people have often abuſed their power, it muſt be granted; for they have often <hi>ſacrificed</hi> themſelves and their poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the <hi>wanton will</hi> of an individual, and <hi>this</hi> is the foundation of all the regal tyrannies which have ſubſiſted in ſociety; but <hi>no abuſe</hi> of their power can <hi>take away their right,</hi> becauſe their right <hi>exiſts in the very conſtitution of things.</hi> If the French people there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould be ſo <hi>capricious</hi> as to fling off their new conſtitution, and ſubject themſelves to more <hi>unequal</hi> forms of government, or
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:023517_0039_0FBFC2E6E1E26870"/>
even to <hi>tyranny,</hi> it will be agreeable to the courſe of paſt experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: But ſuch an exertion of power <hi>cannot injure their right;</hi> and whatever form or complexion any future government in France may bear, it can have no <hi>legitimate</hi> ſource, <hi>but in the will of the people.</hi>
