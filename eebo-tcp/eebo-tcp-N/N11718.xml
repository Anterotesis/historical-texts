            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE <hi>following pages contain an anſwer to one of the moſt artful, inſidious and pernicious pamphlets I have ever met with. It is addreſſed to the paſſions of the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at a time when their paſſions are much inflamed. At ſuch junctures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cool reaſon and judgment are too apt to ſleep: The mind is eaſily impoſed on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the moſt violent meaſures will,</hi> therefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>be thought the moſt ſalutary. Poſitive aſſertions will paſs for demonſtration with many rage for ſincerity and the moſt glaring abſurdities and falſhoods will be ſwallowed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The author of</hi> COMMON SENSE. <hi>has availed himſelf of all theſe circumſtances. Under the maſk of friendſhip to America, in the preſent calamitous ſituation of affairs, he gives vent to his own private reſentment and ambition, and recommends a ſcheme which muſt infallibly prove ruinous. He propoſes that we ſhould renounce our allegiance to our ſovereign, break off all connection with Great-Britain, and ſet up an independent empire of the republican kind. Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that ſuch a propoſal muſt, even at this time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ears of Americans; he inſinuates that the</hi> novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>of his ſentiments is the only</hi> obſtacle <hi>to their</hi> ſucceſs.—that, <q>
                  <hi>perhaps they are not yet ſufficiently faſhionable to procure them general favour; that a long habit of not thinking a thing wrong, gives it a ſuperficial appearance of being right<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and raiſes at firſt a formidable outcry in defence of cuſtom.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In this he imitates all other enthuſiaſts and viſionary aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertors of paradoxes, who were conſcious that the common feelings of mankind muſt revolt againſt their ſchemes: The author, however, though he did not intend it here, pays a compliment to the Americans; for this amounts to a confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that amidſt all their grievances, they ſtill retain their allegiance and loyalty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="unknown:014809_0004_0F94DAB939F64990"/>
               <hi>With the ſame view, I preſume, to make his pamphlet go down the better, he prefixes the title of</hi> Common Senſe <hi>to it—by a figure in rhetoric, which is called a</hi> Catachreſis, <hi>that is, in plain Engliſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> an abuſe of words. Under this title, he counteracts the cleareſt dictates of reaſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> truth, and common ſenſe, Thus have I ſeen a book written by a popiſh bigot, entitled.</hi> Mercy and Truth; or Charity maintained; <hi>in which the author very devoutly and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably damns all heretres.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I find no</hi> Common Senſe <hi>in this pamphlet but much</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common <hi>phrenzy. It is an outrageous inſult on the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe of Americans; an inſidious attempt to perſon their minds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſeduce them from their loyalty and trueſt intereſt. The principles of government laid down in it, are not only falſe, but too abſurd to have ever entered the head of a crazy politician before. Even Hobbes would bluſh to own the author for a diſciple. He unites the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and rage of a republican. with all the enthuſiam and folly of a fanatic. If principles of truth and common ſenſe, however, would not ſerve his ſcheme, he could not help that by any other method than by inventing ſuch as</hi> would, <hi>and this he has done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>No perſon breathing, has a deeper ſenſe of the preſent diſtreſſes of America, than I have—or would rejoice more to ſee them removed, and our liberties ſettled on a perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, conſtitutional foundation. But this author's propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, inſtead of removing our grievances<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> would aggravate them a thouſand fold. The remedy is infinitely worſe than the diſeaſe. It would be like cutting off a leg, becauſe the toe happened to ache.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is probable that this pamphlet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> like others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will ſoon ſink in oblivion—that the deſtructive plan it holds out will ſpeedily be forgotten, and vaniſh like the baſeleſs fabric of a viſion; yet while any honeſt man is in danger of being ſeduced by it—whilſt there is even a poſſibility that the dreadful evils it is calculated to produce ſhould overtake us. I think it a duty which I owe to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to my King and Country, to counteract<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in this manner, the poiſon it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. Nor do I think it leſs a duty thus to vindicate our
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:014809_0005_0F94DAB9F97A6E88"/>
honourable Congreſs, and my injured countrymen in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, from the duplicity and criminal inſincerity with which this pamphlet virtually charges them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The reader, however muſt not expect that I ſhould ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the drudgery of returning a diſtinct anſwer to every part of a pamphlet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in which the lines in many places are out-numbered by falſhoods: and where the author's malice and antipathy to monarchical government, miſrepreſent al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every thing relative to the ſubject. I have done, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what I conceive to be ſufficient—I have deve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loped his leading principles, and obviated ſuch miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations as are apteſt to miſlead the unwary. I have, moreover, ſhewn that this ſcheme is big with ruin to Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica—that it is contrary to the ſentiments of the coloniſts, and that in a reconciliation with Great-Britain, on ſolid, conſtitutional principles, excluding all parliamentary taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the happineſs and proſperity of this continent, are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be ſought or ſound.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I neither have nor can poſſibly have any intereſts ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from thoſe of America—any object in view but her welfare. My fate is involved in her's. If ſhe becomes a conquered country, or an independent republic, I can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe myſelf no advantage or emolument in either caſe; but muſt inevitably ſhare with millions in the evils that will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue. This I can declare, before the ſearcher of hearts, is the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Can the author of</hi> Common Senſe <hi>do the ſame? Can he truly and ſincerely ſay that he has no honour, power, or profit in view ſhould his darling republican ſcheme take place? If not then he is an intereſted, prejudiced perſon, and very unfit to adviſe in this matter. We ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſtful of his judgment, and on our guard againſt what he recommends.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The author calls himſelf an</hi> Engliſhman, <hi>but whether he is a native of</hi> Old England <hi>or</hi> New England, <hi>is a thing I neither know nor care about. I am only to know him by the features he hath here exhibited of himſelf, which are thoſe of an avowed violent Republican, utterly averſe and unfriendly to the Engliſh conſtitution. He hath not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:014809_0006_0F94DABAB98D75A0"/>
fixed his name to his pamphlet; neither ſhall I prefix mine to this. But as I fear his abilities juſt as little as I love his republican cauſe. I hereby pledge myſelf that in caſe he ſhould reply, and publiſh his name; I alſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhould I think it neceſſary to rejoin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhall publiſh my name. I honour ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius wherever I meet with it; but deteſt its proſtitution to bad purpoſes. The few ſaint glimmerings of it that are thinly ſcattered through this pamphlet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are but a poor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation for its malevolent, pernicious deſign; and ſerve only to raiſe our indignation and abhorrence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I hope the reader will diſtinguiſh—where there is a real difference—between this Republican's cauſe, and that of America. If not and if he is not willing to liſten calmly to truth. I adviſe him to ſtop here and lay down this pamph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let. But if the caſe be otherwiſe, I have only to beſeech him, whilſt peruſing theſe</hi> STRICTURIS, <hi>to remember that they were written to promote our reconciliation with a King and nation whom, not long ſince we ſincerely loved and eſteemed. The bittereſt enmity I know is that which ſubſiſts between theſe who were once friends<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but have fallen out. On ſuch occaſions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and while our reſentment is high, the advice which tends to gratify that reſentment may be the moſt welcome. But when our paſſions ſubſide our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer affections will alſo return; and we ſhall then look upon him to be much more our friend who would calm our reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than him who would inflame it From our former connection with Great Britain, we have already derived numberleſs advantages and benefits; from a cloſer union with her, on proper principles, we may derive ſtill greater benefits in future Duty gratitude, intereſt, nay Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by its all-wiſe diſpenſations, loudly call on both coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries to unite, and would join them together; and may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy be the portion of that wretch who would put them aſunder.</hi>

            <head>SECTION I. STRICTURES <hi>on the Author's Aſſertions concerning</hi> "the Origin and Deſign of Government in general; and his Remarks on the Engliſh Conſtitution."</head>
            <p>WRITERS on politics, like thoſe on philoſophy, are very apt to be warped by prejudice, and the ſyſtems they have previouſly adopted. They often draw general concluſions from particular premiſes, and form their judgement of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, not from a general view of mankind in their various ſituations; but from the conduct of a few individuals, and the particular ſtate of things at the time they wrote. Whilſt ſome of them pretend to delineate the true ſtate of human nature, perhaps they only give us a diſguſting picture of their own dark and gloomy minds. Moreover, thoſe wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are charged with founding their principles, not on na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and fact, but on their own prejudices, on improbable ſuppoſitions and imaginary caſes, which never had an criſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Hence that variety of viſionary political fabrics that have been raiſed, contradictory to each other, and repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of common ſenſe, and which will not bear the teſt of ſober examination. Some of them indeed may do very well on paper; but can never be reduced to practice, unleſs a race of beings, very different from men, can be found for the purpoſe.</p>

Whilſt writers of this ſort amuſe themſelves with <hi>Utopian</hi> ſyſtems, and go no further, they may be borne with, and paſs without much cenſure. Their works may be read like other romances or fictions. But if they preſume to looſe the bands of ſociety, and overturn governments that have been formed by the wiſdom of ages, to make way for their own crude ſyſtems, and thereby entail miſery and ruin upon mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions; it is then abſolutely neceſſary to examine thoſe ſyſtems, point out their deſtructive tendency, and unmaſk the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers that propoſe them.</p>
            <p>The author of a pamphlet, falſely and abſurdly entitled COMMON SENSE, is not only chargeable with a large por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the above defects, in common with other political ſyſtem-makers, but alſo with the further deſign of rending the Britiſh empire aſunder. To realize his beloved ſcheme of Independent Republicaniſm, he would perſuade the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniſts to renounce their allegiance to our true and lawful liege ſovereign King GEORGE III—plunge themſelves into a tedious, bloody, and moſt expenſive war with Great Britain—and riſque their lives, liberties and property on the dubious event of that war.</p>
            <p>This is the principal object his pamphlet has in view; other things are only mentioned as conducive to that end. To prepare the reader for it—to take off that horror which every honeſt man and well-informed friend of America muſt naturally feel at a propoſal ſo wicked and ruinous; he firſt treats of ſome other matters which he faſhions to his purpoſe. He poiſons the fountain that the ſtream may be rejected. With this deſign, he delivers his ſentiments on government, the Engliſh conſtitution and monarchy. I ſhall now very briefly examine what he has offered on theſe ſubjects.</p>
            <p>He tells us, that <q>ſome writers have confounded ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with government;</q> and then ſupplies us with a diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is to ſet all right. He ſays, <q>Society is produced by our wants, and government by our wickedneſs.</q> We may reaſonably preſume there are neither wants nor wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Heaven. According to this doctrine then, there can be no ſociety nor government there; and yet we are aſſured of the contrary.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:014809_0009_0F94DABCF98B23E0"/>
This diſtinction is not only inaccurate, but it is alſo found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on falſe principles; and we might expect the reverſe of both, when the errors of others are profeſſedly corrected. Our wants do not produce ſociety; nor are they the firſt or principal cauſe of it. Did this gentleman ever know of any one that was born out of ſociety? Are we not by an act of Providence in our birth, made members of ſociety? A ſtate of ſociety is the natural ſtate of man; and by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of his mind and frame he is fitted for it. Not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his wants and weakneſs require it, but his inclinations, his nobleſt faculties impel him to it; and the more perfect thoſe faculties are, the better is he fitted for ſociety. As nature has thus made us members of ſociety, without any choice or will of ours; ſo, whatever happineſs or perfection we are capable of, can only be attained in ſociety.</p>
            <p>This writer's account of the origin of government is equally exceptionable with that of the origin of ſociety. I can no more aſſent to it than to Hobbes's notion,—<q>that mankind are naturally in a ſtate of war, and that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in founded in ſuperior power of force.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Since Providence hath formed us for ſociety, and placed us in it from the time of our firſt exiſtence, I am of Hook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's opinion,—<q>that ſociety could not be without govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor government without law,</q> though mankind were ever ſo virtuous. For what is government, but the regulation of ſociety by laws? It is well known to all who are converſant in hiſtory, that the different ſtates, the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent forms of government which have ſubſiſted in the world, and of which we have any records, had their origin from a variety of cauſes peculiar to each. Of theſe I ſpeak not, but of government in general, herein following my republican guide.</p>
            <p>As we cannot doubt but the benevolent author of our being, wills our happineſs in the ſtate where he hath placed us, he ſurely wills alſo the means which lead to that end—thoſe means are order and government. Thus far I hold, with the beſt republican writers on this ſubject, the divine right of government, whoſe end is the good of mankind; yet without appropriating that right to any particular form,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:014809_0010_0F94DABDB984DE68"/>
excluſively of others. Were men as virtuous as angles; yet, if collected in large ſocieties, there muſt be a variety of ſtates and conditions among them; and wherever ſuch ſocieties are, government will be indiſpenſibly neceſſary.</p>
            <p>But not to enter deeply into this ſubject, which would be foreign to my deſign, I ſhall juſt obſerve, that man is a moral agent, and thereby fitted to be governed by laws:—He is born in ſociety, whoſe ends cannot be obtained, but by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination, order and the regulation of laws; and where theſe are, there is government. I conclude, therefore, that government is agreeable to the will of the Deity—that it has its origin in the nature and ſtate of man—that in framing governments by mutual compact, men act according to the law of their nature, and dictates of reaſon, which thus point out the only effectual way to attain happineſs and avoid evil. I draw my principles from nature and fact, without having recourſe to ſyſtem—the never failing refuge of weak minds, and of party writers.</p>
            <p>Agreeable to the origin he aſſigns to government, our author ſeems to think the only buſineſs of government is to <hi>puniſh;</hi> for, he ſays, that as ſociety is a "patron," ſo government is "a puniſher." But to think thus, betrays an equal ignorance of the principles of government, and of matter of fact. Numberleſs bleſſings flow from government, beſides the ſecurity reſulting from a reſtraint of vice by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing the vicious. Were there no wickedneſs, there would probably be little occaſion for penal laws; but are theſe the only laws enacted by government? The criminal law of any ſtate makes but a ſmall part of its general code. It is Livy, I think, who ſomewhere defines government to be, <q>The empire of laws, and not of men.</q> According to this definition, the laws of our author's government, <hi>produced by wickedneſs,</hi> would exerciſe a moſt tyrannical ſway—being deſigned only to <hi>puniſh,</hi> they would probably reſemble the laws of Draco, which were ſaid to be written in blood. Perſons who entertain ſuch notions of government, may be well calculated to form a ſanguinary code of laws, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to execute them; for, as we may ſuppoſe their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are congenial with their minds and diſpoſition, doubtleſs
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:014809_0011_0F94D9F1D98182B0"/>
they would feel very well inclined to inflict every kind of puniſhment without ſcruple.</p>
            <p>To evince the truth of his aſſertion, that <q>Government is produced by wickedneſs,</q> our author adds, <q>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, like dreſs, is the badge of loſt innocence; the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces of Kings are built on the ruins of the bowers of Paradiſe.</q> This is mighty <hi>florid</hi>—what pity that it has no ſolidity! Juſt ſo, ſay I—ploughing and ſowing, like dreſs, are the badges of loſt innocence: The farmer's cottage, barn, ſtable, and hog-houſe are built upon the ruins of the bowers of Paradiſe; I cannot ſee that this <hi>pretty</hi> ſentence proves any thing but the author's enmity to Kings and monarchical go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments: For if he would hereby ſhew the inexpediency of either, the ſame argument will equally ſhew the inexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diency of ploughing and ſowing, of the farmer's cottage, barn, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Having thus laid his foundation, the author proceeds to erect his ſuperſtructure; and I aſſure you, gentle reader, the one is perfectly ſuitable to the other. <q>In order to gain a clear and juſt idea of the deſign and end of government,</q> ſays he, <q>let us ſuppoſe a ſmall number of perſons ſettled in ſome ſequeſtered part of the earth, unconnected with the reſt; they will repreſent the firſt peopling of any country, or of the world. In this ſtate of natural liberty,</q>—well! what would they firſt do or think of? Why.—<q>ſociety will be their firſt thought</q> This indeed might poſſibly happen, were we to ſuppoſe that theſe perſons had dropped from the clouds, or ſprung out of the earth, and could all ſpeak the ſame language. On any other principle, the caſe here ſtated is utterly devoid of probability.</p>
            <p>The author in this, follows the example of ſome other manufacturers of political ſyſtems, who fly to fiction, when matters of fact ſhould be related: But as he has managed things, his fiction is contradictory and replete with abſurdity. For he ſuppoſes that thoſe perſons <q>ſettled in ſome ſequeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered part of the earth,</q> had emigrated—<q>that the firſt difficulties of emigration had bound them together;</q> and yet gravely tells us, "their firſt thought," when ſettled, "would be ſociety!" I opine this thought would ſtrike them, and had been practiſed long before.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:014809_0012_0F94DABE7974C168"/>
But further. Amidſt <q>a thouſand motives that would excite them thereto,</q> i. e. ſociety, "one" among others, he ſays, would be that—<q>diſeaſe, nay even misfortune would be death; for altho' neither might be mortal, yet either would diſable any individual from living, and reduce him to a ſtate in which he might rather be ſaid to periſh than to die.</q> Here, "diſeaſe, nay even misfortune" would be "death;" yet neither be "mortal;" yet ſtill, either would "diſable from living;" but this would only be "periſhing" and not "dying!" here I give the author's own words—I did not make theſe contradictions and blunders, but found them.</p>
            <p>It would be a waſte of time to trace this gentleman's won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful colony any further; which is ſo far from <q>repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt peopling of any country,</q> that I ſincerely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it repreſents the firſt peopling of no one country ſince the days of Adam; at leaſt my memory does not furniſh me with one parallel inſtance at preſent; and ſome parts of his ſcheme are deſtitute even of the fainteſt probability. It is very likely, however, that he had the firſt ſettlement of theſe Britiſh colonies in view, while thus helping us <q>to gain a clear and juſt idea of the deſign and end of government.</q> Many circumſtances favour this ſuppoſition; but there is not the leaſt reſemblance between them. The firſt Britiſh emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grants to America, were in a ſtate of Society before their emigration;—in England they jointly applied for grants of land here—they received grants, charters and inſtructions, which veſted them with a legal title to thoſe lands, and marked the outlines of thoſe governments that were to be formed here. When thoſe emigrants found themſelves in America, they did not then firſt think of ſociety; for they were in a ſtate of ſociety before, and the governments they erected here, were conformable to the plans they had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly received in England.</p>
            <p>After finiſhing this goodly political edifice, the author is pleaſed to beſtow ſome <q>remarks on the ſo much boaſted conſtitution of England.</q> He aſſures us—<q>he draws his idea of the form of government from a principle in nature which no art can overturn, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:014809_0013_0F94DABF39751370"/>
more ſimple any thing is, the leſs liable it is to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered, and the eaſier repaired when diſordered; and with this maxim in view, he offers his remarks.</q> But he inſtantly forgets his promiſe, and pays no regard to this maxim. Abſolute monarchy is, paſt all doubt, the ſimpleſt form of government; yet this gentleman prefers democracy, which is infinitely more complex, and the moſt liable to diſorders of any. The truth is, that this principle was uſhered in, purely to contraſt it with the complex nature of the Engliſh conſtitution, and thereby prejudice the reader againſt the latter. Let me add, that if, as he himſelf declares, <q>we are never in a proper condition of doing juſtice to others, while we continue under the influence of ſome leading partiality;</q> this partial, avowed republican, is one of the unfitteſt perſons breathing to offer remarks on the Engliſh conſtitution. He cannot hold the ſcales of juſtice with an even hand.</p>
            <p>"That the conſtitution of England was noble," ſays he, <q>for the dark and ſlaviſh times in which it was erected, is granted.</q> This is condeſcending—it would be more ſo, had he informed us what "dark and ſlaviſh times" he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to. The conſtitution of England, as it now ſtands, was fixed at the revolution, in 1688—an aera ever memorable in the fair annals of Liberty. It was then that the limits of royal prerogative on the one hand, and the liberties and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of the ſubject, on the other; were aſcertained with preciſion. But certainly that was neither a "dark nor ſlaviſh time." It would not be worth while to contend with a man that could aſſert it. The lamp of ſcience never ſhone brighter in any country than in Britain, nor did patriots of greater fame ever adorn the cauſe of freedom, than thoſe who ſtood forth to aſſert her liberties, at that diſtinguiſhed period. If our author means any time before that, it is impertinent to the purpoſe, nor am I concerned about it. What is it to us, what the conſtitution of England was two or three hundred or a thouſand years ago? That conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as fixed at the revolution, as it <hi>now</hi> ſtands, is what we are intereſted in.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:014809_0014_0F94DABFF97891F8"/>
"But that it is imperfect," he continues, <q>ſubject to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions, and incapable of producing what it ſeems to promiſe, is eaſily demonſtrated.</q> If he will be pleaſed to inform me of any political conſtitution, of human contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, that was or is perfect, and not ſubject to convulſions, I ſhall be obliged to him, and readily give it the preference to that of England. But until he, or ſome other perſon does ſo, I ſhall continue in my preſent firm belief, that the conſtitution of England approaches the neareſt to perfection—that it is productive of the greateſt happineſs and benefit to the ſubject, of any conſtitution on earth. Nor ſhall I heſitate to prefer it, in theſe reſpects, to any conſtitution that antiquity can boaſt of.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But the conſtitution of England is ſo exceedingly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex, that the nation may ſuffer for years together, without being able to diſcover in which part the fault lies.</q> Theſe are matters that fall not within my line—I leave them to ſuch <hi>profound, eagle-eyed</hi> politicians as our author. One thing is certain, that if any man is aggrieved, either in his perſon or property, he muſt ſoon know it; and in either caſe he has a ſpeedy remedy by the conſtitution of England. The late legal deciſion in favour of Mr. Wilkes, (no favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite of the court or miniſtry)—reſpecting general warrants, evidently demonſtrates the ſecurity enjoyed by an Engliſh ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, the equity and ſuperior excellence of the Britiſh conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. But what is the complexneſs of that conſtitution to us? The conſtitution of the colonies is very ſimple; each being adminiſtered by a governor, council and aſſembly. Let our liberties, property and trade be once ſecured on a firm conſtitutional bottom, and the complexneſs of the Engliſh conſtitution cannot in the leaſt affect us.</p>
            <p>Having hitherto ſkirmiſhed only at a diſtance, our author prepares now for a nearer and more formidable attack on the Engliſh conſtitution; ſuch as ſeems to threaten it with total demolition. <q>By examining its component parts, he finds them to be the baſe remains of two ancient tyrannies, compounded with ſome new republican materials. 1ſt, The remains of monarchial tyranny in the perſon of the King. 2d, The remains of ariſtocratical tyranny in the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:014809_0015_0F94DAC0B9769DF8"/>
perſons of the Peers. 3d the new republican materials, in the perſons of the Commons; the two former being hereditary, are independent of the people, and therefore in a conſtitutional ſenſe contribute nothing towards the freedom of the ſtate.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here are ſeveral hard words; and as ſome readers may not well underſtand them, I ſhall beg leave to explain them. The learned reader will the more readily excuſe me, as this method may beſt elucidate the ſubject before us, and deve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lope this vile medly of jargon and miſrepreſentation.</p>
            <p>It is, I think, generally admitted by political writers, that there is in every ſtate, whatever its form of government may be, a ſupreme, abſolute power. The diſtribution of this power is what conſtitutes the different forms of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and that form is beſt, which moſt effectualy ſecures the greateſt ſhare of happineſs to the whole. There are uſually reckoned three forms of government, called <hi>ſimple,</hi> in oppoſition to thoſe which are compounded of all three, or only two of the three. The firſt is Monarchy, when the ſupreme power of a ſtate is lodged in one perſon. When this power is placed in the hands of a few, or ſmall number of nobles, it is called an Ariſtocracy, which is the ſecond form of ſimple government. The third is, where the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign power is lodged in the people at large, and this is called Democracy.</p>
            <p>Each of theſe forms is ſubject to abuſe, and often has been aubuſed. The abuſe of monarchy is called tyranny—The abuſe of ariſtocracy is called oligarchy—The abuſe of democracy is called anarchy; though the word tyranny may be applied to the abuſe of any of them. Our republican au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor applies it to the two former, even when not abuſed; and through his whole pamphlet he makes no diſtinction between the right uſe and abuſe of a thing. If he happens to diſlike it, as in the caſe of monarchy, however reſtrained and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated for the benefit of the ſubject, it is reprobated by the groſs—it is nothing but <hi>tyranny.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may not be improper to obſerve here, that monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal governments are beſt adapted to extenſive dominions; po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular governments to a ſmall territory. It is alſo worthy of
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:014809_0016_0F94DAC17980F668"/>
obſervation, that, although there have been, and ſtill are many abſolute monarchies; yet no government was ever purely ariſtocratical or democratical—owing probably to the unavoidable evils incident to each—or to the impracticable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of forming either. This is candidly owned by Harring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, a noted republican writer. "Though for diſcourſe," ſays he, <q>politicians ſpeak of pure ariſtocracy, and pure democracy, there is no ſuch thing as either of theſe in nature or example.</q> Algernos Sidney, another republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can writer, acknowledges the ſame<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>See his works, page 132.</hi>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>As each of theſe ſimple forms would be attended with numberleſs inconveniences, it has been the opinion of the wiſeſt men in every age, that a proper combination of the three, conſtitutes the beſt government. It is the peculiar, diſtinguiſhing glory of the Engliſh conſtitution, that it is a happy mixture of theſe; ſo tempered and balanced, that each is kept within its proper bounds, and the good of the whole thereby promoted.</p>
            <p>For what is the conſtitution—that word ſo often uſed—ſo little underſtood—ſo much perverted? It is, as I conceive—<hi>that aſſemblage of laws, cuſtoms and inſtitutions which form the general ſyſtem; according to which the ſeveral powers of the ſtate are diſtributed, and their reſpective rights are ſecured to the different members of the community.</hi> By imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally examining the component parts of the Engliſh conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, it will be found, that the ſupreme power is diſtributed in the beſt manner to attain this important end—the ſecurity of their reſpective rights to all the members of the community. Theſe parts are,—</p>
            <p>I. The King; who has the executive power, and other prerogatives, which are all ſo ordered, ſo reſtrained within conſtitutional limits, as to prevent their being injurious. He can take no man's money, or property of any kind, without a law paſſed by the other branches of the legiſlature for that purpoſe. He can take no man's life, before the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon has had a trial, and is condemned by his peers. He can deprive no man of his liberty, unleſs the perſon has vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olated the laws of the ſtate. And this is what our <hi>candid</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:014809_0017_0F94DAC239774DC0"/>
republican calls the "baſe remains of monarchical tyranny."</p>
            <p>II. The Peers; who are one branch of the legiſlature, and in ſome caſes have a ſhare in the judicial power. They have other privileges alſo, but all circumſcribed ſo as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent injury to others. As theſe are chiefly hereditary, and are veſted with large property, they are equally independent of the crown and people, and deeply intereſted in the welfare of the ſtate. Hence they form a ſtrong barrier againſt any encroachment from either of the other branches, and give ſtability to the conſtitution. Theſe are what our <hi>gentle</hi> republican calls "the baſe remains of ariſtocratical tyranny."</p>
            <p>III. The Houſe of Commons; the members of which are choſen by the people; without whoſe conſent, no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney can be levied, nor law paſſed to bind the ſubject; and who are themſelves, as well as others, bound by the laws that are enacted. Theſe are what our author calls the "new republican materials." But why <hi>new?</hi> The Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons was not firſt formed at the Revolution. Its origin is hid in the remote depths of antiquity. It may be traced with certainty for near ſix hundred years back;—ſome, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially republican writers, trace it much further; although it may have undergone ſeveral variations before the revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Calling it <hi>new,</hi> therefore, is juſt of a piece with many other of our author's expreſſions.</p>
            <p>The ſupreme power of the ſtate is diſtributed among theſe three branches of the Britiſh legiſlature, in ſuch a manner, that the conſtitution has almoſt all the advantages of each of the three ſimple forms of government, and ſcarcely any of their inconveniences. On preſerving an equal poize in each of theſe branches, depends the good of the whole: No pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent man, therefore, no real friend of Britiſh Liberty, will ever wiſh to ſee any of them paſs the conſtitutional limits; or attempt to throw power into any of them which would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the balance.</p>
            <p>This is a plain, conciſe repreſentation of the Engliſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. It is ſufficient to refute our Republican's miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of it, juſt as relating truth, in other caſes, is a ſufficient refutation of falſhood. But left he, or my reader, ſhould think that I mean to ſkip over any thing that has the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:014809_0018_0F94DAC2F97588A0"/>
appearance of argument, I ſhall follow him a little further on this ſubject.</p>
            <p>
               <q>To ſay, that the conſtitution of England is an union of three powers reciprocally checking each other is farcical,</q> he tells us. This is a new and ſhort method of confutation, ſuch indeed as nothing can withſtand. How happy is it for mankind, that this acute reaſoner has not thought proper to employ it, in ſhewing the nullity of theſe reciprocal duties and obligations ſubſiſting between huſband and wife, parent and child, maſter and ſervant! They muſt all have infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly vaniſhed, and have been annihilated by a few <hi>farcical</hi> ſtrokes of his pen! Yet ſo it happens, that the beſt and wiſeſt men, the warmeſt advocates of liberty, have viewed this reciprocal check of the three branches of the legiſlature, not as "farcical, unmeaning or contradictory;" but as the moſt effectual method that human wiſdom could deviſe to promote happineſs and liberty.</p>
            <p>Still, however, he inſiſts,—that "to ſay the Commons are a check upon the King, preſuppoſes two things. 1. That "the King is not to be truſted without being looked after." I think no man ſhould be truſted with uncontrouled power during life.—No, not even a <hi>ſelf-denying, humble</hi> Republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can. <q>Or that a thirſt of abſolute power is the natural diſeaſe of monarchy.</q>—Not a jot more ſo than of repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licaniſm. 2. That <q>the Commons by being appointed for that purpoſe, are either wiſer or more worthy of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence than the King. But as the ſame conſtitution which gives the Commons a power to check the King, gives af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the King a power to check the Commons; it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain ſuppoſes that the King is wiſer than thoſe, whom it has already ſuppoſed to be wiſer than him. A mere abſurdity!</q>
            </p>
            <p>There is, I confeſs, a palpable abſurdity here; but it lies in our author's <hi>ſuppoſitions</hi> concerning what the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>ſuppoſes;</hi> not in the mutual check which the King and Commons have upon each other. Is it not highly abſurd to ſuppoſe, that a man, becauſe he has a conſtitutional check upon others, muſt therefore be wiſer than thoſe others? A common conſtable has, in many caſes, a check upon his

            <p>COME we now to our author's obſervations on "Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy and hereditary Succeſſion." The laſt of theſe I ſhall ſay little about, for the following reaſons. I have hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility enough to think, that thoſe illuſtrious patriots who ſettled the ſucceſſion of the crown of England in the Houſe of Hanover, ſoon after the revolution, knew full as much of the matter as I do,—or as even our author knows.

                  <hi>The Grounds and Reaſons of Monarchy conſidered and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified in the Scotch Line, &amp;c.</hi> BY JOHN HALL, <hi>of</hi> Gray's Inn, <hi>Rſquire; bound with</hi> Harrington's <hi>works.</hi>
               </note> written by one John Hall, a penſioner under Oliver Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well; and I have nothing to do with John Hall, but with the author of Common Senſe. Hereditary monarchy is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely preferable to elective, and more conducive to the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of mankind. In Poland we ſee a ſpecimen of the miſery and wretchedneſs to which elective monarchy expoſes a nation,</p>
            <p>But it will be proper to beſtow a few minutes in examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what is here alledged concerning monarchy in general; againſt which this republican marſhals a formidable hoſt of arguments. The reader will remember, that monarchy may be either abſolute; or mixed and combined with the other ſimple forms of government. Our author makes no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction between theſe; and although all he ſays, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times more that might be ſaid, were true with reſpect to the former; yet all this would not militate in the leaſt againſt the mild and tempered monarchy of Great-Britain. Let us, however, attend to his arguments.</p>
            <p>
               <q>In the early ages of the world, according to ſcripture chronology, there were no kings; the conſequence of which was, there were no wars; it is the pride of kings which throws mankind into confuſion. Holland without a king hath enjoyed more peace for this laſt century, than any of the monarchical governments in Europe.</q> It were needleſs, at preſent, to determine how early kings began to reign; eſpecially as we find by ſcripture chronology and ſcripture hiſtory, that there was murder, violence and war;—that "the earth was filled with violence"—long enough before we hear a ſyllable about kings,—I may ſay before there were any. Referring thoſe diſorders, therefore, to
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:014809_0021_0F94DAC5397CDBA0"/>
that origin, is unfair and untrue. Melchizedec is one of the firſt kings we read of; he lived in the times of patriarchal ſimplicity, and his character is reſpectable, being not only a king, but alſo "the prieſt of the moſt High God," This account of kings is very different from our author's.</p>
            <p>The inſtance of Holland is injudiciouſly ſelected, to ſhew that ſtates which have no kings, are therefore exempt from war. There has not been a general war in Europe for a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury paſt, in which Holland was not deeply engaged; except the very laſt, and this was more owing to inability than any other cauſe. Every page almoſt of the hiſtory of the <hi>Seven United Provinces,</hi> is a refutation of our author's aſſertion. His inſinuation, that ſtates which have not kings, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from, and not addicted to war, is equally groundleſs. Republics have been as much involved in wars as other ſtates. The ſeveral republics of Greece inliſted under the banners of Sparta, on one ſide, or thoſe of Athens on the other—both republics waged a moſt bloody war for thirty years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. And what is very remarkable, they were plunged into this war by Pericles, a popular Athenian, and celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſpeaker; who being impeached for <hi>embezling the public money</hi> and applying it to his <hi>own private uſe,</hi> took this terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble method to divert an enquiry. The war ended in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Athens. The ſingle republic of Rome, made greater havoc of the human ſpecies, ſhed more blood, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed more wretchedneſs and miſery through the earth, and was guilty of more cruelty, oppreſſion and tyranny, than perhaps any <hi>three</hi> monarchies that can be mentioned in the whole compaſs of ancient hiſtory. If a few ſmall republics of modern date, have more reſpite from war than ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies, it is more owing, like their very exiſtence, to their particular ſituations, the jealouſy of neighbouring powers, and other ſimilar circumſtances, than to the nature of their government.</p>
            <p>"Government by Kings," this writer tells us, <q>was firſt introduced by Heathens.</q> And ſo, ſay I, was Greek and Latin—ſo was ſmoaking tobacco; and yet I can dip into Homer and Virgil, or enjoy my pipe, with great compoſure of conſcience. The firſt hint of bleeding, in
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:014809_0022_0F94DAC5F973DAF0"/>
caſes of ſickneſs, is ſaid to have been taken from the croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dile—of adminiſtring clyſters, from the Ibis, an Egyptian bird. Theſe ſeem to be of worſe than heathen origin; yet mankind uſe them without ſcruple; and perhaps their diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline might not be amiſs for our author, conſidering his ſtate of mind. If a thing is good in itſelf, I conceive it to be a matter of very little moment, who it was that firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced it. I am clearly of opinion alſo, that democracy, our author's favourite ſcheme of government, was of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh origin, as well as monarchy: And ſince he is ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe to any thing heatheniſh, I would beg leave to remind him, that falſhood, deceit, and ſpeaking evil of dignities, are heatheniſh crimes, and expreſsly forbidden by ſcripture.</p>
            <p>But the worſt is yet to come; for <q>government by Kings, was the moſt proſperous invention the devil ever ſet on foot for the promotion of idolatry. The heathens paid divine honours to their deceaſed Kings.</q> If the devil was the author of this invention, for the purpoſe here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, then I aver he was miſtaken in his forecaſt; or elſe he ſoon retained all the Heathen republics in his ſervice, to promote the ſame end. For it is a moſt notorious, undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fact, that the ancient republics—Rome, Carthage, Athens, &amp;c. were as infamous for every ſpecies of the groſſeſt and moſt abominable idolatry, as any monarchies whatever. Let the Floralia of Rome, and human ſacrifices offered at Carthage, to mention no other inſtances, ſerve as proofs of this. The truth is, that idolatry had ſpread its gloomy reign almoſt univerſally over the Heathen world. The form of government in any ſtate, neither promoted nor retarded it any more than the ſhape of their ſhields, or the form of their wiſkers. The pureſt ſyſtem of religion, that Heathen antiquity can boaſt of, prevailed in Perſia, where monarchy was eſtabliſhed; the remains of which religion are ſaid to be preferred to this day among the inhabitants of Indoſtan.</p>
            <p>But <q>Heathens paid divine honors to their deceaſed Kings.</q> The more fools they, no doubt; however, they did the ſame to their deceaſed heroes, and benefactors in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, whether Kings or not, whether male or female. If
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:014809_0023_0F94DAC6B97D8B68"/>
this argument, therefore, is of any force againſt govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Kings, it is of equal force againſt any improvement in agriculture; againſt cleaning ſtables, and killing ſnakes; for Heathens paid divine honours to deceaſed perſons for all thoſe exploits. It is ſcarcely poſſible to return a grave an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to ſuch ſophiſtry; eſpecially, when the author may, perhaps, care as little for the Bible, as he does for the Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran or Shaſthah, only as it may ſerve his purpoſe.</p>
            <p>From Heatheniſm, our author flies next to ſcripture for arguments againſt monarchy. Were I a parſon I ſhould be better qualified to deal with him in this way. However, as I am a ſincere believer in divine revelation, I ſometimes read the Scripture for inſtruction—nor am I aſhamed to own it—Boyle, Locke, and Newton, did the ſame. I alſo have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe ſometimes to a few commentators, which the clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the place where I live, hath recommended to me. Thus furniſhed, I ſhall venture to examine his ſcripture ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments. One conſolation to me is, that he ſeems to be an equal adept in theology and juriſprudence.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The will of the Almighty, as declared by Gideon and Samuel (ſays our republican) expreſly diſapproves of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by Kings.</q> So it might on thoſe particular occaſions, and for ſome peculiar reaſons; and yet our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by Kings at this time, may be as acceptable to the Almighty, as any other government. <q>All anti-monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical parts of ſcripture (he continues) have been ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gloſſed over in monarchical governments.</q> If ſo, our author has profited by the practice, and has greatly improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on it; for he has entirely ſlipt over (without giving even a <hi>ſmooth gloſs</hi>) all the monarchical parts of Scripture, except one, which, I ſhall immediately conſider; after aſſuring the reader, that I never have met with the anti-monarchical parts of Scripture. In the bible, I am ſure they are not. The Jewiſh polity, in which the Almighty himſelf conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to be King (and thence called a Theocracy) is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in favour of monarchy than againſt it; though I am not clear, that any one ſpecies of regular government is more acceptable to the Deity now than another; whatever prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:014809_0024_0F94DAC7797A3BC0"/>
may be due to one above another, in point of expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency and benefit.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Render unto Caeſar the things that are Caeſar's, is the Scripture doctrine of courts,</q> ſays our author; and pray is it not Scripture doctrine in other places, as well as courts? Is it not the doctrine of Him who is the Saviour of men? The words are part of an anſwer which our Saviour returned to an inſidious queſtion that was propoſed to him by ſome emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries from the Phariſees, <abbr>viz.</abbr> Whether it was lawful to pay tribute to Caeſar, i. e. the Roman Emperor, or not? Judaea was at this time ſubject to the Romans. The Gaulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites, or Zealots, a ſect or party ſo called, affirmed that the Jews, being God's people, ſhould not acknowledge any other Lord, nor pay tribute to an heathen power—others affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the contrary—the determination was therefore put to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, with deſign to enſnare him. His deciſion, which was for paying the tribute, was grounded on the then practice and eſtabliſhed maxims of the Jews. They held, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the money of any perſon, bearing his title and image, was current, the inhabitants thereby acknowledged that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for their ſovereign. Since, therefore, the Jews owned this of Caeſar, by admitting his money, which bore his title and image, our Saviour told them, they ſhould alſo pay him tribute. For he ordered the tribute money to be brought, and the Jews owning that it bore Caeſar's image and ſuperſpription, or title,—<q>Render, therefore (ſays he) to Caeſar the things that are Caeſars,</q> i. e. ſince you acknowledge his ſovereignty over you by admitting his coin, render to him the tribute which, on your own principles, is thereby due.</p>
            <p>If this text has been applied to ſupport monarchical go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment any further than to ſhew, that whatever is by cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, law, or otherwiſe, juſtly due to ſovereigns, ſhould be punctually paid, whether it be tribute, obedience, honour, &amp;c.—if, I ſay, it has been applied to ſupport monarchy any further than this, it muſt be by ſome perſon who underſtood it as little as our author; though not for the reaſon he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, and which in truth makes againſt himſelf.</p>

But I haſten to the paſſages of Scripture, in which our republican author triumphs moſt; which, he ſays, <q>are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and poſitive, and admit of no equivocal conſtruction. That the Almighty has in them entered his proteſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt monarchical government, is true, or elſe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is falſe.</q> On the contrary, I aver, that the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty has not there entered his proteſt againſt monarchical government, further than the Jews had departed from a former permiſſion he had given them to chuſe Kings, and that the Scripture is not falſe. Let us now ſee how a little common ſenſe, reaſon and truth, will help to clear up the matter.</p>
            <p>The paſſages alluded to by the author, are in 1 Sam. viii. where the Iſraelites aſſembled in a tumultuous manner, and deſired Samuel to make them <q>a King, to judge them like all the nations;</q> which offended Samuel, and in ſome meaſure was diſpleaſing to the Almighty. That ſimply de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring a King, could not be a crime, is undeniably evident; becauſe the Almighty had long before expreſsly permitted it, had directed the mode of chuſing a King, and preſcribed the line of conduct the King ſhould obſerve, when choſen. This is done in Deuteronomy xvii. 14—20; and I ſhall here lay a few of the paſſages before the reader.</p>
            <p>
               <q>When thou art come into the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee, and ſhalt ſay, I will ſet a King over me, like as all the nations that are round about me; thou ſhalt in any wife ſet him King over thee whom the Lord thy God ſhall chuſe: one from among thy brethren ſhalt thou ſet King over thee: thou mayeſt not ſet a ſtranger over thee which is not thy brother.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Almighty then proceeds to give directions for the King's conduct, thus choſen; all, wiſely ſuited to the Jewiſh ſtate, both in a religious and political view. The King "was not to multiply horſes;" to prevent any intercourſe with Egypt, which ſupplied other nations with horſes; and beſides, cavalry was not ſuited to the hilly country of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daea. The King was <q>not to multiply wives, that his heart turn not away;</q> as happened to Solomon when he diſobeyed this precept: Nor "greatly multiply gold and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:014809_0026_0F94DAC8F96E4D10"/>
to himſelf," which would introduce luxury and diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of manners.</p>
            <p>The directions go on—<q>And it ſhall be when he, i. e. the King, ſitteth upon the throne of his kingdom, that he ſhall write a copy of this law in a book, and it ſhall be with him, and he ſhall read therein all the days of his life: that he may learn to fear the Lord his God, to keep all the words of this law, and theſe ſtatutes to do them: that his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, and that he turn not aſide from the commandment—to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom; he and his children in the midſt of Iſrael.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now, after this, I leave the reader to judge, whether government by Kings could be diſpleaſing to the Almighty; or, whether deſiring a King, according to this permiſſion, and theſe directions, could be a crime in the Iſraelites. It is impoſſible that either can be true. The crime of theſe people, therefore, when they deſired a King of Samuel, "to judge them like all the nations," muſt be attributed to ſomething elſe. And upon examination, we ſhall find, that their error lay in the <hi>manner</hi> of their aſking a King—in the <hi>principles</hi> on which they acted—in a <hi>diſregard</hi> of the venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble old prophet—but chiefly in a <hi>neglect</hi> of the <hi>directions</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove mentioned. This will appear evident from a bare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cital of facts.</p>
            <p>Samuel, by his faithful adminiſtration, had reſtored the purity of religion, and reſcued the nation from the hoſtile attempts of their enemies. Debauched by proſperity, as too frequently happens, dazzled with the luſtre of a ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did court, and deſirous of its pomp, the people tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly aſſembled to deſire a King, who would reſemble the deſpotic Kings which ſurrounded them. They covered their real deſign with the pretext of Samuel's age and infirmities, and his ſons irregularities, which was inſulting the prophet's miſfortunes. This is evidently implied in their own words, and in the ſequel.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Behold, (ſay they to Samuel) thou art old, and thy ſons walk not in thy ways; now make us a King to judge us like all the nations.</q> Hereby Samuel, who had faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:014809_0027_0F94DAC9B96BB8E8"/>
ſerved them, had been diſplaced; and ſuch a deſpotic Prince as they deſired, had deſtroyed the theocracy they were under. Accordingly, the Almighty tells Samuel, <q>They have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I ſhould not reign over them.</q> i. e. It is not thee ſo much as me, that they have rejected. Although Samuel was ungratefully treated; yet they ſtill more wicke<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected the directions given by the Almighty. Pride and ambition, ſtimulated them to ſeek a King, not ſuch as the Almighty had directed them to chuſe; but ſuch as the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons had; and ſuch as would overturn the theocracy. This was virtually rejecting the Almighty from being their King.</p>
            <p>Samuel, however, was directed to hearken to the people; but as the ſame time to lay alſo before them, the nature of that monarchy they deſired; a monarchy like thoſe around them. The eaſtern nations, it is well known, were under deſpotic monarchs, the <hi>manner</hi> or nature of which, Samuel accordingly deſcribes to the Iſraelites, to try, whether they would perſiſt in their choice after hearing it.

            </p>
            <p>This whole paſſage is a deſcription of the eaſtern deſpotic monarchs, which Samuel held up to the Iſraelites, with deſign to deter them from chuſing ſuch; and this is the paſſage which our author ſets down, enriched with his own moſt <hi>judicious</hi> comments, to ſhew that God <q>entered his proteſt againſt monarchical government in general.</q> Whereas, in truth, it is only an account of the then deſpotic monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies of the Eaſt, which Samuel was directed to lay before the Iſraelites, that they might ſee how inconſiſtent ſuch a monarchy was with their peculiar ſtate and circumſtances; and this again with deſign to divert them from chuſing ſuch.</p>
            <p>Ambition and pride, however, got the better of duty and intereſt with the people—a caſe that happens but too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently. They ſtill inſiſted on having the King they had ſet their hearts on—<q>That we alſo, ſay they, may be like other nations.</q> Hereby ſhewing the greateſt blindneſs to their
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:014809_0028_0F94DACA796A9008"/>
own happineſs, which conſiſted in being unlike the other nations, by having God himſelf for their King; and ſuch a Judge or King as would be his DEPUTY, not an abſolute Prince. The Almighty at laſt condeſcended to their infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and gave them a King: but as in the caſe of the ritual law, he tempered his juſtice with mercy. He gave them Saul, who proved a ſcourge; yet he ordered matters ſo that the general end of his diſpenſation to the Jews was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated. Saul's ſucceſſor was "a man after his own heart," by a zealous attachment to, and punctual execution of, the Moſaic law in his regal character; and David again, in our author's phraſe, <q>to the evil of monarchy, added that of hereditary ſucceſſion;</q> which it ſeems, however, the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty did not diſapprove of.</p>
            <p>The reader is now left to determine freely, whether theſe paſſages make in the leaſt againſt government by Kings; and whether this republican's perverſion of them, either through real or affected ignorance, ſhould have any weight to influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence us againſt our ſovereign. For my part, I think the caſe ſo plain, that I ſhall not beſtow another word upon it; only to add the following reflections of a learned writer on the above tranſaction. <q>The ſecret ſpring of the people's conduct (ſays he) was the ambition of their leaders, who could live no longer without the ſplendor of a regal court—where every one of them might ſhine a diſtinguiſhed officer of ſtate. This is was that made their demand cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal; for their chuſing regal, rather than ariſtocratical, vice-roys, was a thing plainly indulged to them by the law of Moſes, Deuteronomy xvii. As therefore ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on only was in the view of the ringleaders, and no fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh fears for the ſtate, or hopes of bettering the public adminiſtration, it is evident to all acquainted with the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of this time and people, that compliance with their demand muſt have ended in the utter deſtruction of the Moſaic religion, as well as law.</q> With this writer the moſt celebrated commentators on this paſſage agree.</p>
            <p>Thus ambition ſet the Iſraelites on deſiring a King; our republican author ſhould reflect, whether the ſame princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple does not actuate and lead him to reject his lawful ſovereign.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:014809_0029_0F94DACB3968ABA8"/>
The author of <hi>Common Senſe,</hi> ſuſpects, <q>there is as much King-craft as Prieſt-craft in withholding the Scripture from the public in Popiſh countries, for monarchy is the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery of government.</q> But is it not ſtrange, that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſhould be guilty of the very crime he here charges up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on others? Yet he does this by withholding from the reader every text that would develope the falſhood of his own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved ſcheme. This, I think, may be called <hi>Republican</hi>-craft; and let it hereafter be added to the two ſpecies of <hi>craft</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove mentioned. A man of candor would deal fairly, and give both ſides of the queſtion. Had there been another text in the bible that could be preſſed into his ſervice, beſides what he has quoted, we may be ſure he would have produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it, with his own <hi>enlightened</hi> comments. With his good leave, therefore, I ſhall now ſet down a few texts, which probably, he may call the "Scripture doctrine of monarchy;" but which are the words of inſpired truth notwithſtanding. I aſſure the reader further, that I am none of your <hi>paſſive obedience and non-reſiſtance men</hi> The principles on which the glorious Revolution in 1688 was brought about, conſtitute the articles of my political creed; and were it neceſſary, I could clearly evince, that theſe are perfectly conformable to the doctrines of ſcripture. To proceed then, like a parſon, with my texts; referring in the margin, to the places in which they are contained, that the reader may conſult them at his leiſure.</p>

            <p>All theſe texts, beſides many others of the ſame kind, I find in my bible. I muſt therefore renounce my bible, if I believe this republican.

            <head>SECTION III. STRICTURES on what the Author delivers as his <hi>"Thoughts on the preſent State of American Affairs."</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IF the perſon who was capable of ſo vile a proſtitution of Scripture, as we have ſeen in the preceeding ſection, ſhould equally proſtitute the words, Reaſon, Argument, Common Senſe, in this, it is not to be wondered at. That this is the caſe, will appear by a near examination. From the author's defultory way of writing, and want of method in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:014809_0032_0F94DACD7967B978"/>
his thoughts, it is not eaſy to follow him,—howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, I muſt do as well as I can.</p>
            <p>In this ſection before me, this Gentleman unfolds his grand ſcheme of a revolt from the Crown of England, and ſetting up an independent republic in America. He leaves no method untried, which the moſt experienced practitioner in the art of deceiving could invent, to perſuade any people to a meaſure which was againſt their inclinations and intereſt, that was both diſagreeable and deſtructive. He unſays in one place what he had ſaid in another, if it happens to ſerve the preſent purpoſe; he cants and whines; he tries wit, raillery and declamation by turns. But his main attack is upon the paſſions of his readers, eſpecially their pity and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment,—the latter of which is too apt to be predominant in mankind. As for himſelf, he ſeems to be every where tranſported with rage—a rage that knows no limits, and hurries him along, like an impetuous torrent. Every thing that falls in with his own ſcheme, or that he happens to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, is repreſented in the moſt aggravated light, and with the moſt diſtorted features. Such a malignant ſpirit I have ſeldom met with in any compoſition. As often as I look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this ſection, I cannot forbear imagining to myſelf a guilty culprit, freſh reeking from the laſhes of indignant juſtice, and raging againſt the hand that inflicted them. Yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perſuade myſelf, that ſuch fire and fury are genuine marks of patriotiſm. On the contrary, they rather indicate that ſome mortifying diſappointment is rankling at heart; or that ſome tempting object of ambition is in view; or proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly both. I always adopt the famous Biſhop Berkeley's max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im in ſuch caſes,—<q>I ſee a man rage, rail and rave; I ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect his patriotiſm.</q>
            </p>
            <p>That theſe obſervations are juſtified by the author's own words, I ſhall now proceed to evince; and I doubt not but the candid reader will conſider what I ſay in the ſenſe it is meant—is directed againſt this republican's ruinous ſcheme of Independency. <hi>This</hi> and this <hi>only,</hi> is what I combat. My moſt ardent wiſh—next to future happineſs—is, to ſee tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity reſtored to America—our Liberties, Property and Trade ſettled on a firm, generous and conſtitutional plan,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:014809_0033_0F94DACE395E14B8"/>
ſo that neither of the former ſhould be invaded, nor the latter impoliticly or unjuſtly reſtrained; that in conſequence of this, a perfect Reconciliation with Great-Britain were ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, an union formed, by which both countries, ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſupported by each other, might riſe to eminence and glory, and be the admiration of mankind till time ſhall be no more. In ſuch a plan, the real intereſt of America is indubitably to be ſought; and could my influence avail, there would not be a diſſenting voice in the colonies—all would unite as one man, and uſe every effort, to have ſuch a plan ſpeedily ſettled.</p>
            <p>The author of Common Senſe ſays, <q>He has no other preliminaries to ſettle with the reader, than that he would diveſt himſelf of prejudice and prepoſſeſſion, and ſuffer his reaſons and feelings to determine for themſelves.</q> I have no objection to theſe preliminaries. They are ſuch as I myſelf would chuſe to ſettle with the reader; provided his feelings are not thoſe of rage and reſentment, which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly improper to determine in matters of ſuch moment. It is not improbable indeed, that every republican who is as prejudiced, intereſted, and vindictive as himſelf, will agree with him in all his extravagancies; and ſo perhap they would, though an angel from Heaven were to aſſure them that they are wrong. But I am confident the readers of that ſtamp make but a very ſmall number at preſent in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.</p>
            <p>After obſerving, that <q>many writers have embarked in the preſent controverſy, with various deſings, he ſays, they have all been ineffectual, and the period of debate is cloſed. Arms, as the laſt <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, decide the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt; the appeal was the choice of the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent accepted the challenge.</q> That an appeal was made by the King to arms for the deciſion of this unhappy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, on the 19th of April, the period our author ſixes, is a matter in which I am not quite clear; but more of this preſently. If ſuch a challenge was accepted by the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, I am ſure it was with great reluctance. They deſired it not; although this writer, by his manner of expreſſion, inſinuates they did. But he theſe matters as they will, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:014809_0034_0F94DACEF963F888"/>
it is, that the peried of debate did not then cloſe. The challenge was not accepted ſo as to exclude an amicable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation. Since that time, the Honourable Continen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Congreſs petitioned the King, and tranſmitted addreſſes to the inhabitants of Great-Britain and Ireland, to facilitate a reconciliation. Nor can I conceive it poſſible, that any one, unleſs ſome ſanguinary wretch, who hopes to profit by our confuſions, ſhould wiſh to ſee the conteſt finally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided by arms.</p>
            <p>
               <q>By referring the matter from argument to arms, a new aera of politics is ſtruck—all plans, propoſals, &amp;c. prior to the 19th of April—are like the almanacks of laſt year; which, tho' proper then, are ſuperceded and uſeleſs now.</q> I ſhall not undertake a decide on the value of old almanacks, as I am not an almanack-maker—the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor may know more of the matter. But he here takes for granted what ſhould have been proved, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that the matter or conteſt was ultimately referred from argument to arms. If the ſenſe of our Congreſs, and of the inhabitants of this continent at large, is any rule to judge by, all plans and propoſals, even thoſe prior to the 19th of April, are not uſeleſs. A free people, who have a juſt ſenſe of their rights and liberties, are very juſtifiable in ſhewing they will not tamely give them up without a ſtruggle. But no people, except ſome tribes of ſavages, who aim at the total exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of their enemies, will ever loſe fight of argument and negociation, to terminate ſuch diſputes. To inſinuate the contrary of the Americans, is at once doing them the greateſt injuſtice, and offering them the greateſt inſult. No people under Heaven are leſs ſanguinary, or deſerve ſuch a character leſs.</p>
            <p>Our author repeats the ſame ſentiment elſewhere. "No man," ſays he, <q>was a warmer wiſhes for reconciliation than myſelf, before the fatal 19th of April, 1775; but the moment the event of that day was made known, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the hardened, ſullen tempered Pharaoh of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land for ever; and diſdain the wretch, that with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended title of father of his people, can unfeelingly hear of their ſlaughter, and compoſedly ſleep with their blood
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:014809_0035_0F94DACFB9621040"/>
upon his ſoul.</q> This is the man, gentle reader, who declares, <q>he is not induced by motives of pride, party or reſentment, to eſpouſe the doctrine of ſeparation and independence;</q> no, no; and if you will take his own word for it, he is by no means for <q>inflaming or exagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating matters!</q> The reader muſt be ſenſible, that a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who can thus ſet truth and decency at defiance, and is regardleſs of even the appearance of conſiſtency, has a great advantage over his antagoniſt.</p>
            <p>That the expedition to Lexington was raſh and ill-judged—that it was riſking the peace of the continent, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly involving fellow ſubjects in blood, for a moſt inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable object—I ſhall moſt readily allow; and our author has my leave to load that expedition with all the reproaches he can invent. I diſapprove the deſign of it as much as he—I lament its effects much more. And from whatever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy circumſtances it aroſe, I am well aſſured, from the very beſt authority, that the King's orders to all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders or Generals on this continent, were to act <hi>only on the defenſive,</hi> and in ſupport of the laws. Now, after <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ving ſuch reſtraining orders how the blood of thoſe who were killed on either <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>" inconceivable. If this Republican, therefore, rejected his Sovereign, on account of the unforeſeen blood-ſhed at Lexington, it was only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> little attachment to him before; and this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity was only ſeized by the author to give went to a diſaffection which only ſlumbered before. Thus, by wilful ſlanders, to poiſon the minds of fellow ſubjects, and ſow diſaffection among them, which may be productive of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral miſery, is a crime of ſuch complicated guilt, that none but men of the moſt abandoned profligate hearts, are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of committing.</p>
            <p>After all, it is impoſſible to aſſign any good reaſon, why a reconciliation with Great-Britain, which was ſo proper be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lexington affair, ſhould be ſo improper afterwards. Our author, indeed, in his uſual way, dogmatically aſſerts it; but <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> will not paſs for proofs. If peace and reconciliation on conſtitutional grounds, and proper ſecurity
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:014809_0036_0F94DAD079629510"/>
for our ſeveral rights, were deſirable and advantageous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the 19th of April, 1775, muſt they not have been equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo after the event of that unfortunate day? Let reaſon and common ſenſe anſwer.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But as ſo much has been ſaid of the advantages of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation,</q> continues our author, <q>it is but right we ſhould examine the contrary ſide of the argument, and inquire into the material injuries which the colonies ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and always will ſuſtain by being connected with Great-Britain.</q> He alledges, indeed, ſeveral evils which he ſuppoſes would attend that connection; but cautiouſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voids any mention of the numberleſs evils and calamities which we muſt infallibly ſuffer by breaking it off. As in a former caſe, ſo in this alſo, I ſhall endeavour to ſupply his omiſſion in due time.</p>
            <p>"Some have aſſerted," he tells us, <q>that as America hath flouriſhed under her former connection with Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Britain, that the ſame connection is neceſſary towards her future happineſs. Nothing can be more fallacious.</q> He adds—<q>We may as well aſſert, that becauſe a child hath thrived upon milk, that it is never to have meat.</q> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever glib this quaint ſimile may run upon paper; or however convincing it may appear to ſhallow readers; yet, in truth, when examined, it contains a palpable impropriety, and is impertinent to the caſe before us. Great-Britain is figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively called the Parent State of the colonies; their connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, therefore, may be properly compared to the <hi>relation</hi> ſubſiſting between parent and child. But to compare our <hi>connection</hi> with Great-Britain to the <hi>literal food</hi> of a child, a thing different from, and not neceſſarily belonging to that <hi>relation,</hi> is manifeſtly abſurd, and a violation of the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of language; as all who are judges of the nature of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage muſt be ſenſible. The <hi>relation</hi> of parent and child ends not, when the latter has arrived to maturity, although the uſe of <hi>milk</hi> may be laid aſide; and that relation may be ſtill neceſſary to the happineſs of both; the ſame may be truly affirmed of <hi>connection</hi> with Great-Britain. But if we muſt ſtretch the ſimile further, we find ſomething analogous to the literal food of a child, it is the litteral ſupport afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:014809_0037_0F94DAD13978CC90"/>
by Great-Britain to the colonies, in their infant ſtate <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly;</hi> and the adminiſtration of the colonies <hi>now,</hi> as well as the general laws of regulation ſhe may make for us. As to any ſupport now, in the above ſenſe, it is confeſſed the colonies in general do not require it. With reſpect to the adminiſtration of the colonies, and regulating laws proper for them, theſe ſhould certainly be varied, and adapted to our maturer ſtate. The want of this is the true ſource of our preſent calamities; and the attainment of it, by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation and conſtitutional union with Great-Britain, is what every honeſt American ſhould earneſtly wiſh for. But the remedy propoſed by our author, would reſemble the conduct of a raſh, froward ſtripling, who ſhould call his mother a d-mn-d b—ch, ſwear he had no relation to her, and attempt to knock her down.</p>
            <p>"But even this," ſubjoins our author, <q>is admitting more than is true; for I anſwer, roundly, that America would have flouriſhed as much, and probably much more, had no European taken any notice of her. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce by which ſhe hath enriched herſelf, are the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of life, and will always have a market while eating is the cuſtom of Europe.</q> If no European power had taken any notice of America, that is to ſay, if none had been at the expence or trouble of diſcovering it, and ſettling colonies in it; there is great probability that America had not flouriſhed, but remained to this day as ſavage a wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as when Columbus or Cabot firſt deſcribed its coaſts.—But to paſs over this blunder. Let the reader only turn to any hiſtory of the ſettlement of the Britiſh colonies, and then judge what had been the condition of Virginia, the firſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, and latterly of Georgia and Nova-Scotia, if Great-Britain had not ſupported them. They muſt as infallibly have periſhed, as an infant without its proper food, had not Great-Britain afforded her aid and ſupport; which have been more or leſs extended to the colonies in general. Even after they had ſurmounted their firſt difficulties, what had been their fate, had not Great-Britain protected them? If ſo happens that avarice, ambition and fighting, are cuſtoms of Europe as well as eating. This being the caſe, ſome other
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:014809_0038_0F94DAD1FA312BC8"/>
European power would indubitably have ſeized all theſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, in their infant ſtate, had not Great-Britain held out her protection.</p>
            <p>And here much matter of grief is preſented to this poor Gentleman. He pathetically laments, that—<q>Alas! we have been long led away by ancient prejudices, and made large ſacrifices to ſuperſtition—not conſidering that the motive of Great-Britain in protecting us, was intereſt, not attachment;</q> and then he ſpins out a tedious, affected ſentence of her <q>not protecting us from our enemies on our account, but from her enemies on her own account,</q> &amp;c. Suppoſing this were true, where is the harm? Great-Britain actually <hi>did</hi> protect us; and it is a matter of little moment to us, what her motives were. If ſhe received be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by it, ſo much the better. Mutual intereſt is the ſtrongeſt bond of union between ſtates, as the hiſtory of mankind teſtifies; and certainly that nation would act a moſt abſurd, as well as wicked part, which laviſhed away its blood and treaſure, without any proſpect of national advantage in return. But I firmly believe, that his aſſertions on this head are as falſe, as they are ungenerous; and that Great-Britain, in protecting us, was actuated by motives of affection and attachment, as well as intereſt. The whole of her conduct to the colonies, till lately, evinces it—the Americans themſelves have acknowledged it. Great-Britain, no doubt, derived many advantages from the colonies; but ſhould we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value her protection on that account, or aſcribe it to ſordid motives only? It is every man's intereſt as well as duty to be honeſt; would it, therefore, be candid, generous or true, to ſuppoſe, that every honeſt man is actuated by ſelfiſhneſs only?—But candour and truth are things that have nothing to do with the procedure of this dark republican, who aims at utterly effacing every trace of former affection and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip between Great-Britain and the colonies; and like a fiend that delighted in human miſery, would arm them with the moſt deadly, irreconciliable hatred againſt each other.</p>
            <p>But he denies that Britain is the parent country of theſe colonies. He <q>reprobates the phraſe, as being falſe, ſelfiſh, narrow and ungenerous.—Europe, (ſays he) and not
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:014809_0039_0F94DAD2B988F548"/>
England, is the parent country of the colonies.</q> It is an obſervation of Epictetus, <q>That if a man will contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the moſt evident truths, it will not be eaſy to find ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments wherewith to confute him—that the diſpoſition to contradict ſuch truths, proceeds from want to candor and modeſty.</q> He moreover adds—that when <hi>ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturous</hi> ſpirits in his time, undertook to deny the plaineſt and moſt evident truths—<q>This denial was admired by the vulgar for ſtrength of wit and great learning.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Whatever circumſtances can denominate any country to be the parent ſtate or country of colonies, may be truly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated of England, with reſpect to theſe American colonies. They were diſcovered at the Expence of the Engliſh crown—firſt ſettled by Engliſh emigrants, and the governments erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here were formed on the model of the Engliſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as nearly as the ſtate of things would admit. The coloniſts were deemed Engliſh ſubjects, and entitled to all the privileges of Engliſhmen. They were ſupported and protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the expence of Engliſh blood and treaſure. Emigrants, it is true, reſorted here from other countries in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; but theſe were not entitled to all the privileges of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh ſubjects, till naturalized by an act of the Engliſh legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or ſome Aſſembly here; and the prodigious confluence of ſtrangers into the colonies, is a proof of the mild and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral ſpirit by which they were cheriſhed and adminiſtered. If theſe particulars do not entitle England to the appellation of mother-country to theſe colonies, I know not what can; and theſe particulars cannot be predicated of any other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in Europe beſides England.</p>
            <p>The author tells us, however—<q>that the phraſe parent or mother country, hath been jeſuitically adopted by the King and his paraſites, with a low papiſtical deſign of gaining an unfair bias on the credulous weakneſs of our minds.</q> I conceive the preſent King, or his paraſites, as he calls them, were not the firſt or only perſons who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted this phraſe; and, therefore, it could not anſwer ſuch a deſign. The phraſe hath already been uſed, both here, and in Britain, ſince the firſt ſettlement of the colonies.</p>
            <p>But this curious obſervation was introduced purely to
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:014809_0040_0F94DAD37996F350"/>
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate the King is a papiſt; which has juſt as much truth in it, as to inſinuate that he is a Mahometan or Gentoo; for there is not a firmer proteſtant in Great Britain, than his preſent Majeſty. The inſinuation might have ſome effect on the credulous weakneſs of ſome ignorant people, who have harboured ſuch an opinion; and I have heard the Quebec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bill alledged as a proof of it, by which, they ſaid, <q>pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was eſtabliſhed in Canada, and the King had violated his coronation oath.</q>
            </p>
            <p>An examination of the Quebec bill, falls not within the compaſs of my deſign. It has undergone the ſcrutiny of much abler hands; ſome of which have affirmed, and others denied, that popery was thereby eſtabliſhed. I diſlike the bill, chiefly becauſe it veſts the Governor and his Council with exorbitant power. It is certain, however, that the popiſh clergy of Canada, complain of the bill, and think themſelves in a worſe ſituation by it, than the articles of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulation and ſurrender left them. By its exempting ſuch Canadians as come over to the proteſtant religion, from pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any eccleſiaſtical dues to their prieſts, it would ſeem, as if the bill was intended to diminiſh the number of papiſts. Be all this as it may, it is paſt any doubt, that the King did not in the leaſt violate his coronation oath by aſſenting to that bill. This will evidently appear by inſpecting the oath itſelf: and as the removal of mutual prejudices to faciliate a reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is my principal view; as the oath is ſhort, and has been ſeen by few, I ſhall here inſert it. The coronation oath is adminiſtered by one of the archbiſhops or biſhops, in the following words and manner—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The archbiſhop ſhall ſay,</hi> Will you ſolemnly promiſe and ſwear, to govern the people of this kingdom of England, and the dominions thereunto belonging, according to the ſtatutes in parliament agreed on, and the laws and cuſtoms of the ſame? <hi>The King ſhall ſay,</hi> I ſolemnly promiſe ſo to do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The archbiſhop.</hi> Will you, to your power, cauſe law and juſtice, in mercy, to be executed in all your judgments? <hi>King.</hi> I will.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The archbiſhop.</hi> Will you to the utmoſt of your power maintain the laws of God; the true profeſſion of the goſpel,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:014809_0041_0F94DAD439D87CA8"/>
and the proteſtant reformed religion, eſtabliſhed by law? And will you preſerve unto the biſhops and clergy of this realm, and to the churches committed to their charge, all ſuch rights and privileges, as by the law do or ſhall apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto them, or any of them? <hi>King.</hi> All this, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>After this the King, laying his hand on the holy goſpel, ſhall ſay,</hi> The things which I have here before promiſed, I will perform and keep: So help me God. <hi>And then ſhall kiſs the book.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the coronation oath, and mode of adminiſtering it, as preſcribed by law; and the reader muſt ſee that is has no more relation to the ſtate of religion in Canada, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered province, than to the ſtate of religion in Minorca, a conquered iſland, the inhabitants of which are papiſts, and enjoy as great, if not greater privileges than the Canadians.</p>
            <p>"But admitting," continues our author, <q>that we were all of Engliſh deſcent, what does it amount to? Nothing. Britain being now an open enemy, extinguiſhes every other name and title; and to ſay that reconciliation is a duty, is truly farcical.</q> Here the <hi>farcical</hi> argument meets me again; and what ſhall I ſay to it? I proteſt I do not underſtand it. I have ſearched for its meaning in vain; and have no hope of fathoming it, till the author is pleaſed to explain it<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>
                     <hi>The author, elſewhere, recommends a manoeuvre, to which I apprehend, the word</hi> farcical <hi>may be properly applied. After kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offering a republican form of government, which he deſires may be adopted in America, he introduces a perſon aſking this queſtion—"But where is the King of America?" and then returns this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer—</hi>
                     <q>
                        <hi>I'll tell you friend, he reigns above; and doth not make havock of mankind like the</hi> Royal Brute <hi>of Great-Britain.</hi>
                     </q> This pretty flower, <hi>with which he garniſhes our Sovereign, ſeems to be culled rather from the</hi> bowers of Billinſgate, <hi>than thoſe of</hi> Paradiſe, <hi>formerly mentioned. The reader cannot forbear ſeeing here the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm of</hi> Fifth-monarchy <hi>men, and their rudeneſs too. Strange that this Republican's rage ſhould blind him ſo that he cannot ſee what every body elſe ſees—that—</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>—"<hi>Want of decency is want of ſenſe!</hi>"</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But to return. The</hi> farcical <hi>paſſage next follows—<q>Yet that we may not appear defective in earth, honours, let a day be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly ſet apart for proclaiming the [continental] Charter: let it be brought forth placed on the divine law, the word of God; let a crown be placed thereon—But leaſt any ill uſe ſhould afterwards ariſe, let the crown, at the concluſion of the ceremony, be demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, and ſcattered among the people whoſe gift it is.</q> I now ſubmit it to the reader's better judgment, whether this whole cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is not highly</hi> farcical; <hi>eſpecially as this Republican has given us the ſtrongeſt ſuſpicion that he has an</hi> equal <hi>regard for the word of God, and for Kings and monarchical government. If I am wrong in this conjecture. I utterly deſpair of ſucceſs in finding out the meaning of this word.</hi>
                  </p>
               </note>. But to the point in hand. If what would
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:014809_0042_0F94DAD4F9913A78"/>
promote our happineſs and intereſt, to mention nothing elſe, be a duty, then reconciliation is our duty.</p>
            <p>He elſewhere enlarges on this head. <q>Bring the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of reconciliation,</q> ſays he, <q>to the touch-ſtone of nature, and then tell me, whether you can hereafter love, honour and faithfully ſerve the power that carried fire and ſword into your land!</q> All this, and a great deal more of the kind, can only proceed from a ſuppoſition of the author, that others are as vindictive and unforgiving as himſelf. When ſtates go to war, mutual acts of hoſtility muſt neceſſarily enſue; and to think that no reconciliation ſhould afterwards take place between them, is as contrary to every dictate of humanity and religion, as to think that a private perſon ſhould never forgive a private injury, or be reconciled to him that offered it. I lament as much as any one, the blood that has been ſhed, and the devaſtation that has been made during this conteſt: But theſe have been comparatively ſmall, if we conſider the torrents of blood that have flowed, the wide-ſpread ruin that has attended the frequent deſtructive wars between England and Scotland; yet theſe nations are now happily united—they mutually love, honour, and faithfully ſerve each other.</p>
            <p>The author refers us to the ſtate of Boſton, and paints the diſtreſſes of its inhabitants in the ſtrongeſt colours, to ſtimulate the revenge of Americans, and baniſh every idea of reconciliation with Britain. I ſincerely take part in the calamities of Boſton, and other places that have ſuffered. I
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:014809_0043_0F94DAD5B9C07C20"/>
feel the moſt tender ſympathetic pity for the diſtreſſes of their inhabitants. But how the ſhedding of more blood, or ſpreading equal devaſtation along the whole ſea coaſt of this continent—the inevitable conſequences of not liſtening to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation—how theſe, I ſay, can alleviate the misfortunes of the people of Boſton, or any other ſufferers, in what I am not able to ſee.</p>
            <p>"Much hath been ſaid," he tells us, <q>of the united ſtrength of Britain and the colonies; that in conjunction they might bid defiance to the world: But this is a mere preſumption; the fate of war is uncertain—the next war may not turn out like the laſt.</q> But he chaunts quite another tune, when he would hold up the advantages of a ſeparation from Britain. In that caſe he avers—<q>'Tis not in the power of England, or of Europe, to conquer Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica—nay, our preſent numbers are ſufficient to repell the force of the whole world!</q>—This is only one ſample among a thouſand, of the duplicity and contradiction which run through his pamphlet.</p>
            <p>After telling us, what is very true, that we have no buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to "ſet the world at defiance," he adds, as an induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſeparate from Britain—<q>Our plan is commerce; and that well attended to, will ſecure us the peace and friendſhip of Europe, becauſe it is the intereſt of Europe to have America a free port. Her trade will always be a protection, and her barrenneſs of gold and ſilver will ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure her from invaders.</q>—Yes, yes; no doubt, if Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica were once to throw off her connection with Britain, the golden age would be reſtored! The Millennial ſtate would commence. <q>Men would inſtantly beat their ſwords into plough-ſhears, and their ſpears into pruning hooks. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would not lift up ſword againſt nation, not learn war any more.</q> Such are the happy times our author promiſes us, if America were an independent republic! But until he can give us ſome aſſurance that may be relied on, that am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, pride, avarice, and all that dark train of paſſions which uſually attend them, will be extinguiſhed in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man breaſt, and will no more exert their baneful influence, I muſt beg leave to doubt the truth of his aſſertions—I muſt
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:014809_0044_0F94DAD67989B4B0"/>
queſtion, whether we ſhall live in perpetual peace with Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, or even with each other, after our revolt from England.</p>
            <p>The argument or reaſon he advances for it here, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted by general experience and matter of fact. A flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing trade naturally increaſes wealth; and for this and other reaſons, as naturally leads to war. Carthage, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice and Holland—all commercial republics—were frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engaged in bloody wars, in the days of their proſperity. Nor is "barrenneſs of gold and ſilver" any ſecurity againſt war or invaſions. Experience and fact are equally againſt this poſition. I never heard of the gold or ſilver mines of Flanders. The Low Countries are entirely barren of both; but they are remarkable for their fertility, good paſturage, manufactures, and formerly, for trade; yet I may ſay, each field there is a field of blood, and has been the ſcene of ſome dreadful carnage. Great-Britain and France have few or no gold and ſilver mines; yet they have been theatres of bloody wars, as long as any record we have of either reaches. On the other hand, South America ſupplies half the globe with gold and ſilver; and yet, ſtrange to tell, on our author's principles, no rival power has ever contended with Spain or Portugal for the dominion of South America! No invaders have attempted to diſpoſſeſs them.</p>
            <p>The truth is, that mines producing thoſe metals are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther injurious than beneficial to any country. They unbrace the nerves of induſtry, induce ſloth, and damp the ſpirit of commerce. Spain was one of the moſt flouriſhing, power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful monarchies in Europe, when this continent was diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Peru and Mexico then poured their immenſe treaſures into her lap, and have been doing ſo ever ſince; yet Spain, ever ſince, has been on the decline, and is dwindled, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding her gold and ſilver, into a ſtate, I may ſay, of inſignificance. The country that abounds in fertile fields and luxuriant paſturage—that produces the neceſſaries of life in abundance—that furniſhes the various materials for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and art, and the articles for an extenſive commerce; ſuch a country, though barren of gold and ſilver, is the moſt inviting to ambition, the moſt expoſed to invaſions; and ſuch a country is North-America.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="unknown:014809_0045_0F94DAD7397601B8"/>
But our author now waxes ſo exceedingly warm, and aſſumes ſo terrific an air, that I almoſt dread to approach him. "I challenge," ſays he, <q>the warmeſt advocate for reconciliation, to ſhew a ſingle advantage that this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try can reap by being connected with Great-Britain, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat the challenge, not a ſingle advantage is derived.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The poſitive, dogmatical manner in which this challenge is repeated, reminds me of an obſervation made by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Dr. Beattie, which applies, in the preſent caſe, as exactly, as if this bluſtering challenge had given riſe to its "In reading ſceptical books," ſays the worthy Doctor, <q>I have often found, that the ſtrength of the author's at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to his paradox, is in proportion to its abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. If it deviates but a little from common opinion, he gives himſelf but little trouble about it; if it be inconſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with univerſal belief, he condeſcends to argue the matter, and to bring what, with him, paſſes for a proof of it; If it be ſuch as no man ever did or could believe, he is ſtill more conceited of his proof and calls it demonſtration, but if it is inconceivable, it is a wonder if he does not take it for granted.</q> Our republican takes it for granted, that no advantage could reſult from our future connection with Great-Britain—a parodox which I think, muſt be utterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable to every other human underſtanding. Brimful, however, of this conceit, he throws down his gauntlet, and offers this challenge; leaving his readers to ſtare a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent time, and to heſitate which they ſhould admire moſt—the abſurdity of taking this point for granted—or, the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of face</hi> that could advance ſuch a parodox.</p>
            <p>I think it no difficult matter to point out many advantages which will certainly attend our reconciliation and connection with Great-Britain, on a firm, conſtitutional plan. I ſhall ſelect a few of theſe; and that their importance may be more clearly diſcerned, I ſhall afterwards point out ſome of the evils which inevitably muſt attend our ſeparating from Britain, and declaring for independency. On each article I ſhall ſtudy brevity.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By a reconciliation with Britain, a period would be put to the preſent calamitous war, by which ſo many lives
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:014809_0046_0F94DAD7F982DAC8"/>
have been loſt, and ſo many more muſt be loſt, if it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues. This alone is an advantage devoutly to be wiſhed for. This author ſays—<q>The blood of the ſlain, the weeping voice of nature cries, 'Tis time to part.</q> I think they cry juſt the reverſe. The blood of the ſlain, the weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing voice of nature cries—It is time to be reconciled; it is time to lay aſide thoſe animoſities which have puſhed on Britons to ſhed the blood of Britons; it is high time that thoſe who are connected by the endearing ties of religion, kindred and country, ſhould reſume their former friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and be united in the bond of mutual affection, as their intereſts are inſeparably united.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By a Reconciliation with Great-Britain, Peace—that faireſt offſpring and gift of Heaven—will be reſtored. In one reſpect Peace is like health; we do not ſufficiently know its value but by its abſence. What uneaſineſs and anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, what evils, has this ſhort interruption of peace with the parent-ſtate, brought on the whole Britiſh empire! Let eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man only conſult his feelings—I except my antagoniſt—and it will require no great force of rhetoric to convince him, that a removal of thoſe evils, and a reſtoration of peace, would be a ſingular advantage and bleſſing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Agriculture, commerce, and induſtry would reſume their wonted vigor. At preſent, they languiſh and droop, both here and in Britain; and muſt continue to do ſo, while this unhappy conteſt remains unſettled.</p>
            <p n="4">By a connection with Great-Britain, our trade would ſtill have the protection of the greateſt naval power in the world. England has the advantage, in this reſpect, of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry other ſtate, whether of ancient or modern times. Her inſular ſituation, her nurſeries for ſeamen, the ſuperiority of thoſe ſeamen above others—theſe circumſtances to menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no other, combine to make her the firſt maritime power in the univerſe—ſuch exactly is the power whoſe protection we want for our commerce. To ſuppoſe, with our author, that we ſhould have no war, were we to revolt from England, is too abſurd to deſerve a confutation. I could juſt as ſoon ſet about refuting the reveries of ſome brain-ſick enthuſiaſt. Paſt experience ſhews that Britain is able to defend our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:014809_0047_0F94DAD8B975D2D8"/>
and our coaſts; and we have no reaſon to doubt of her being able to do ſo for the future.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The protection of our trade, while connected with Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, will not coſt us a <hi>fiftieth</hi> part of what it muſt coſt, were we ourſelves to raiſe a naval force ſufficient for the purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Whilſt connected with Great-Britain, we have a boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on almoſt every article of exportation; and we may be better ſupplied with goods by her, than we could elſewhere. What our author ſays is true—<q>that our imported goods muſt be paid for, buy them where we will;</q> but we may buy them dearer, and of worſe quality, in one place than another. The manufactures of Great-Britain confeſſedly ſurpaſs any in the world—particularly thoſe in every kind of metal, which we want moſt; and no country can afford linens and woollens, of equal quality cheaper.</p>
            <p n="7">7. When a Reconciliation is effected, and things return into the old channel, a few years of peace will reſtore every thing to its priſtine ſtate. Emigrants will flow in as uſual from the different parts of Europe. Population will advance with the ſame rapid progreſs as formerly, and our lands will riſe in value.</p>
            <p>Theſe advantages are not imaginary but real. They are ſuch as we have already experienced; and ſuch as we may derive from a connection with Great-Britain for ages to come. Each of theſe might eaſily be enlarged on, and others added to them; but I only mean to ſuggeſt a few hints to the reader.</p>
            <p>Let us now, if you pleaſe, take a view of the other ſide of the queſtion. Suppoſe we were to revolt from Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, declare ourſelves Independent, and ſet up a Republic of our own—what would be the conſequence?—I ſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghaſt at the proſpect—my blood runs chill when I think of the calamities, the complicated evils that muſt enſue, and may be clearly foreſeen—it is impoſſible for any man to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee them all. Our author cautiouſly avoids ſaying any thing of the inconveniences that would attend a ſeparation. He does not even ſuppoſe that any inconvenience would attend it. Let us only declare ourſelves independent, break looſe from Great-Britain, and according to him, a Paradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical ſtate will follow! But a prudent man will conſider and
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:014809_0048_0F94DAD9795A4810"/>
weigh matters well before he conſents to ſuch a meaſure—when on the brink of ſuch a dreadful precipice, he muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily recoil, and think of the conſequences, before he advances a ſtep forward. Suppoſing then we declared for Independency,—what would follow? I anſwer—</p>
            <p n="1">1. All our property throughout the continent would be unhinged; the greateſt confuſion, and moſt violent convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions would take place. It would not be here, as it was in England at the Revolution in 1688. That revolution was not brought about by any defeazance or diſannulling the right of ſucceſſion. JAMES II, by abdicating the throne, left it vacant for the next in ſucceſſion; accordingly his eld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt daughter and her huſband ſtept in. Every other matter went on in the uſual, regular way; and the conſtitution, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being diſſolved, was ſtrengthened. But in caſe of our revolt, the old conſtitution would be totally ſubverted. The common bond that tied us together, and by which our property was ſecured, would be ſnapt aſunder. It is not to be doubted but our Congreſs would endeavour to apply ſome remedy for thoſe evils; but with all deference to that reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able body, I do not apprehend that any remedy in their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er would be adequate, at leaſt for ſome time. I do not chuſe to be more explicit; but I am able to ſupport my opinion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What a horrid ſituation would thouſands be reduced to who have taken the oath of allegiance to King; yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their oath, as well as inclination, muſt be compelled to renounce that allegiance, or abandon all their property in America! How many thouſands more would be reduced to a ſimilar ſituation; who, although they took not that oath, yet would think it inconſiſtent with their duty and a good conſcience to renounce their Sovereign; I dare ſay theſe will appear trifling difficulties to our author; but whatever he may think, there are thouſands and thouſands who would ſooner loſe all they had in the world, nay life itſelf, than thus wound their conſcience. A Declaration of Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency would infallibly diſunite and divide the coloniſts.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By a Declaration for Independency, every avenue to an accommodation with Great-Britain would be cloſed; the ſword only could then decide the quarrel; and the ſword
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:014809_0049_0F94DADA395CE7F0"/>
would not be ſheathed till one had conquered the other.</p>
            <p>The importance of theſe colonies to Britain need not be enlarged on, it is a thing ſo univerſally known. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er their importance is to her, ſo much the more obſtinate will her ſtruggle be not to loſe them. The independency of America would, in the end, deprive her of the Weſt-Indies, ſhake her empire to the foundation, and reduce her to a ſtate of the moſt mortifying inſignificance. Great-Britain there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt, for her own preſervation, riſk every thing, and exert her whole ſtrength, to prevent ſuch an event from taking place. This being the caſe—</p>
            <p n="4">4. Devaſtation and ruin muſt mark the progreſs of this war along the ſea coaſt of America. Hitherto, Britain has not exerted her power. Her number of troops and ſhips of war here at preſent is very little more than ſhe judged ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient in time of peace—the former does not amount to 12,000 men—nor the latter to 40 ſhips, including frigates: Both ſhe, and the colonies, hoped for and expected an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation; neither of them has loſt ſight of that deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able object. The ſeas have been open to our ſhips; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſome ſkirmiſhes have unfortunately happened, yet a ray of hope ſtill cheared both ſides that, peace was not diſtant. But as ſoon as we declare for independency, every proſpect of this kind muſt vaniſh. Ruthleſs war, with all its aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated horrors, will ravage our once happy land—our ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coaſts and ports will be ruined, and our ſhips taken. Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of blood will be ſpilt, and thouſands reduced to beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary and wretchedneſs.</p>
            <p>This melancholy conteſt would laſt till one ſide conquered. Suppoſing Britain to be victorious; however high my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is of Britiſh Generoſity, I ſhould be exceedingly ſorry to receive terms from her in the haughty tone of a conqueror. Or ſuppoſing ſuch a failure of her manufactures, commerce and ſtrength, that victory ſhould incline to the ſide of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica; yet who can ſay in that caſe, what extremities her ſenſe of reſentment and ſelf-preſervation will drive Great-Britain to? For my part, I ſhould not in the leaſt be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized, if on ſuch a proſpect as the Independency of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, ſhe would parcel out this continent to the different Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean

Powers. Canada might be reſtored to France, Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rida to Spain, with additions to each—other ſtates alſo might come in for a portion. Let no man think this chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical or improbable. The independency of America would be ſo fatal to Britain, that ſhe would leave nothing in her power undone to prevent it. I believe as firmly as I do my own exiſtence, that if every other method failed, ſhe would try ſome ſuch expedient as this, to diſconcert our ſcheme of independency; and let any man figure to himſelf the ſituation of theſe Britiſh colonies, if only Canada were reſtored to France!</p>
            <p n="5">5. But ſuppoſing once more that we were able to cut off every regiment that Britain can ſpare or hire, and to deſtroy every ſhip ſhe can ſend—that we could beat off any other European power that would preſume to intrude upon this continent: Yet, a republican form of government would neither ſuit the genius of the people, nor the extent of America.</p>
            <p>In nothing is the wiſdom of a legiſlator more conſpicuous than in adapting his form of government to the genius, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, diſpoſition and other circumſtances of the people with whom he is concerned. If this important point is overlook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, confuſion will enſue; his ſyſtem will ſink into neglect and ruin. Whatever check or barriers may be interpoſed, nature will always ſurmount them, and finally prevail. It was chiefly by attention to this circumſtance, that Lycurgus and Solon were ſo much celebrated; and that their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive republics roſe afterwards to ſuch eminence, and acquired ſuch ſtability.</p>
            <p>The Americans are properly Britons. They have the manners, habits, and ideas of Britons; and have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to a ſimilar form of government. But Britons never could bear the extremes, either of monarchy or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicaniſm. Some of their Kings have aimed at deſpotiſm; but always failed. Repeated efforts have been made to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards democracy, and they equally failed. Once indeed republicaniſm triumphed over the conſtitution; the deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of one perſon enſued; both were finally expelled. The inhabitants of Great-Britain were quite anxious for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:014809_0051_0F94DADBB96D2FE8"/>
of <hi>royalty</hi> in 1660, as they were for its expulſion in 1642, and for ſome ſucceeding years. If we may judge of future events by paſt tranſactions, in ſimilar circumſtances, this would moſt probably be the caſe of America, were a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican form of government adopted in our preſent ferment. After much blood was ſhed, thoſe confuſions would termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in the deſpotiſm of ſome one ſucceſsful adventurer; and ſhould the Americans be ſo fortunate as to emancipate themſelves from that thraldom, perhaps the whole would end in a limited monarchy, after ſhedding as much more blood. Limited monarchy is the form of government which is moſt favourable to liberty—which is beſt adapted to the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> and temper of Britons; although here and there among us a crack-brained zealot for democracy or abſolute monarchy, may be ſometimes found.</p>
            <p>Beſides the unſuitableneſs of the republican form to the genius of the people, America is too extenſive for it. That form may do well enough for a ſingle city, or ſmall territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but would be utterly improper for ſuch a continent as this. America is too unwieldy for the feeble, dilatory ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of democracy. Rome had the moſt extenſive dominions of any ancient republic. But it ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered, that very ſoon after the ſpirit of conqueſt car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Romans beyond the limits that were proportioned to their conſtitution, they fell under a deſpotic yoke. A very few years had clapſed from the time of their conquering Greece and firſt entering Aſia, till the battle of Pharfalia, where Julius Caeſar put an end to the liberties of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Caeſar himſelf was the firſt who entirely ſubdued the Gauls, though near neighbours, and that penetrated into Britain. Had it not been for the rivalſhip between Sylla and Marius, who were a check upon each other, Rome had ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendered her liberties before to one or other of thoſe tyrants. Holland is the moſt conſiderable republic in Europe, at preſent; yet the ſmall kingdom of Ireland is more than <hi>twice</hi> as large as the <hi>Seven United Provinces.</hi> Holland, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, has conſiderable colonies in the Eaſt and Weſt Indies; but theſe are under as rigid and arbitrary an adminiſtration as any colonies of France or Spain.</p>

The author of <hi>Common Senſe,</hi> in his abundant care and providence, lays before the public a ſketch of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he would recommend. We thank him for his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but diſlike his ware. It is patch-work, and would make <hi>ſad work</hi> in America. The principal outlines of this ſketch ſeem to be taken from Mr. Harrington's <hi>Rota,</hi> which was too romantic even for the times of <hi>Cromwell.</hi> Our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has made ſuch alterations as he conceived would adapt it to America. It is as much in the democratic ſtyle as the <hi>Rota;</hi> and as improper for America, as the other was for England. I may truly ſay of it, and its author, ſo far as he may claim author-ſhip by it, what MONTESQUIEU ſaid of Harrington and his <hi>Oceana,</hi> of which the <hi>Rota</hi> is a kind of abridgment—<q>For want of knowing the nature of real liberty, he buſied himſelf in purſuit of an imaginary one; and he built a Chalcedon, though he had before his eyes a Byzantium.</q> To make way for this crude, wretched ſyſtem, our author would deſtroy the beſt, the moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful political fabric which the ſun ever beheld!</p>
            <p n="6">6. In fine. Let us, for a moment, imagine that an American republic is formed, every obſtacle having been ſurmounted; yet a very ſerious article ſtill remains to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the <hi>expence</hi> neceſſary to ſupport it. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves thoſe who have any property, to think of this part of the buſineſs. As for our author, it is more than probable he has nothing to loſe; and like others in the ſame predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is willing to truſt to the chapter of accidents and chances for ſomething in the ſcramble. He cannot loſe; but may poſſibly again. His own maxim is certainly true—<q>The more men have to loſe, the leſs willing are they to venture*;</q> and <hi>vice verſa,</hi> ſay I.</p>
            <p>It would be impoſſible to aſcertain, with preciſion, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence that would be neceſſary for the ſupport of this New Republic. It would be very great undoubtedly—it would appear intolerable to the Americans, who have hitherto paid ſo few taxes. I ſhall juſt hint at a few articles.—</p>
            <p>Our author aſſerts the neceſſity of our having a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val

force when independent. It is granted—we could not be without one. The reader, however, will not expect that I ſhould either adopt, or formally refute his hopeful ſcheme—<abbr>viz.</abbr> That merchant ſhips, armed, ſhall be employed for our defence—that is to ſay—That ſhips, when on trading voyages to Europe, Africa, the Eaſt or Weſt Indies, or tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their ladings at thoſe places, ſhall defend the trade and coaſts of America! <q>This, he ſays, would be uniting the ſinews of commerce and defence, and making our ſtrength and riches play into each others hands.</q> The thought, I believe, is original, and the plan entirely his own—it might entitle him to a diſtinguiſhed ſeat among the ſage profeſſors of <hi>Laputa,</hi> who, according to SWIFT, were employed in <q>extracting ſun-beams out of cucumbers, calcining ice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to gun-powder, and making fire malleable,</q> and other ſuch ingenious inventions.</p>
            <p>This Gentleman thinks that, <q>50 or 60 ſhips, mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 20, 30, 40, or 50 guns, with a few guard-ſhips, would keep up a ſufficient navy.</q> Let us take a medium of the firſt of thoſe numbers, and ſuppoſe the American navy to conſiſt partly of <hi>fifty-five</hi> ſhips, each mounting 50 guns. The preciſe coſt of building a 50 gun ſhip in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, is £.14,355 ſterl. Fifty-five ſuch ſhips would coſt £.789,525 ſterling.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe, it would be neceſſary to have ſome larger ſhips; not only to act as "guardſhips," but to make our navy reſpectable, and without which it could nor anſwer the intended purpoſe. Ships of 74 guns are reckoned the moſt ſerviceable; and the Britiſh navy has at this time no leſs than <hi>forty-four</hi> ſuch, that could be fitted for actual ſervice on the ſhorteſt notice; beſides about <hi>ten</hi> more of the ſame ſort, moſt of which could be got ready in a little time. The Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can navy would require at leaſt <hi>thirty</hi> of theſe, and our har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in the middle and ſouthern colonies, would not conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently admit larger ſhips. The coſt of building a 74 gun ſhip in England, is exactly £.27,200 ſterl. The coſt of 30 ſuch ſhips would be £716,000.</p>
            <p>To the above ſhips it would be indiſpenſibly neceſſary to add ſome frigates, which are very uſeful in ſecuring the ſeas
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:014809_0054_0F94DADDF961D1C0"/>
and for various kinds of buſineſs where larger ſhips would be unwieldy, and not anſwer ſo well, Frigates of 32 guns, and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>0 guns, are reckoned the moſt ſerviceable. <hi>Twelve</hi> of each ſort would be as few as our trade and coaſts would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. The coſt of building a 32 gun frigate is £.7480 ſterl. Twelve ſuch frigates would amount to £.89,760 ſterl. The building a 20 gun frigate coſts in England £.4370 ſterling; twelve ſuch frigates would amount to £.52,440 ſterling.</p>
            <p>Cannon, ſmall-arms, ammunition, anchors, cables, &amp;c. are all ſeparate articles from that of building; and are ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive, that a ſhip of war, when fitted for actual ſervice, with ſix months pay and proviſions, is generally reckoned, to coſt one thouſand pounds ſterling for every gun. But as it would be difficult to aſcertain preciſely the expence of theſe—or that of docks, arſenals, founderies, rope-walks, manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factories for ſail-cloth, &amp;c. &amp;c. all which are neceſſary to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards keeping up a regular navy, I ſhall not enter into a minute detail of them; but take them by the groſs, and compute them at a third of the above coſt. Conſidering the high price of labour in America, this computation will be deemed very moderate.</p>

ſhips, beſides thoſe building in the ſeveral dock-yards. The reader may reſt aſſured that my intelligence in the preceding article of coſt for conſtructing a navy, comes from the very beſt authority.</p>
            <p>The annual expence is next to be conſidered. The cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, annual expence of a 50 gun ſhip in England, and for which proviſion is always made by government, is £.18,200 ſterl.—that of a 74 gun ſhip, is £.33,800 ſterl. of a 32 gun frigate, £.11,440 ſterl.—of a 20 gun frigate, £8,320. This is allowed for wear and tear, victualling and wages. Repairs and expence of ammunition, are different articles; which, as they cannot be aſcertained, I ſhall paſs over.

            <p>It is not improbable that the American fleet might very from this liſt, as to the number and ſize of the ſeveral ſhips, juſt as circumſtances might require: Yet certain I am, that in caſe we became independent of England, a fleet <hi>equal</hi> in force to the above, and attended with <hi>equal</hi> expence, would be indeſpenſibly neceſſary. If we are to have any foreign commerce, we muſt, like England, Holland, France, &amp;c. keep ſhips of force in foreign parts, to protect that commerce; beſides thoſe which are neceſſary to defend our coaſts, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and trade near home.</p>
            <p>Conſidering our extenſive line of ſea-coaſt, and our no leſs extenſive frontiers, along which ſo many thouſands of ſavages are ſettled, I think America, when independent, cannot keep leſs than 30 regiments of infantry in conſtant pay, each regiment conſiſting of 700 men; the whole a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting to 21,000 men. The ſmall republic of Holland has an army of 40,000 men in time of peace. As matters are now circumſtanced throughout Chriſtendom, no ſtate can
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:014809_0056_0F94DADF7959DAB0"/>
preſerve its independency without a ſtanding army. The nation that would neglect to keep one, and a naval force, if it has any ſea coaſt, muſt infallibly fall a prey to ſome of its ambitious and more vigilant neighbours.</p>
            <p>The annual expence of an Engliſh regiment, conſiſting of 700 men, is nearly £.15,743 ſterl: And the expence of raiſing, cloathing, and arming foot ſoldiers, is about £.6 a man; which will amount to £4,200 for a regiment of 700 men. Thus the annual expence of 30 regiments would be £.472,290 ſterl; and the charge of raiſing, arming, &amp;c. would be £.126,000 ſterl. Moreover we ſhould find it neceſſary to have ſome regiments of cavalry, to be diſtributed in or near the large towns and cities. Let us ſuppoſe ſix re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments to be raiſed of 300 men each. The annual expence of an Engliſh regiment of dragoons, of 300 men, is nearly £.16,187 ſterl. The annual expence of ſix ſuch regiments would be £.97,122 ſterl; beſides the charge of horſes, arming, &amp;c. which is computed at 30 guineas per man, and would amount to about £56,700 ſterl.</p>

However, to avoid fractions, let it be ſtated at three millions—even this ſum carries hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in the very idea of it; and yet many deluded people flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter themſelves that they will pay no taxes, if we are once In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent! Suppoſing then that Canada, Nova-Scotia, and
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:014809_0057_0F94DAE039FF1F48"/>
Florida were joined to the thirteen colonies now united, the number would be ſixteen. The above ſum equally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided among them would be £.187,500 ſterl; which is nearly equal to 833,333 Spaniſh milled dollars, (reckoning a dollar at 4s.6d. ſterl.) <hi>annual</hi> expence to each colony. But it ſhould be obſerved, that Rhode-Iſland is a ſmall colony—that the three little counties of Newcaſtle, Kent and Suſſex upon Delaware, are reckoned as a colony—that Nova-Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, Georgia and Florida are very young colonies: None of theſe therefore could poſſibly contribute an equal ſhare with the older and larger colonies; the expence of the latter muſt, of courſe, be proportionably greater, to make up the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency: Suppoſing the inhabitants of all theſe colonies amount to <hi>three millions</hi>—and I am of opinion their number is not greater—each individual, man, woman, and child, black and white, would have <hi>twenty ſhillings</hi> ſterling, i. e. above four Spaniſh dollars to pay <hi>annually</hi> for defraying the public ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence. Or, taking every ſeventh perſon for a Taxable, which I think is near the uſual proportion, and that this ſum were to be paid by a Poll-tax, then every Taxable in the colonies muſt pay £.7 ſterl. i. e. about 32 Spaniſh dollars <hi>annually</hi> for the public expence, over and above what he has paid in times paſt.

            <p>This ſum of two millions, three hundred and ſeventy-three thouſand pounds ſterling, joined to the ſixteen millions of dollars, which I am informed the Honourable Congreſs has been obliged already to iſſue, beſides as much more perhaps which they will find neceſſary to iſſue for the ſupport of the war, if it continues, and the prodigious ſums of paper cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency which the ſeveral colonies have ſtruck, and muſt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after

ſtrike; will make a load of debt, that muſt prove ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to this continent.</p>
            <p>I have not knowingly exaggerated a ſingle article in the above eſtimate; and were the trial made, I verily believe the expence would be found much greater. For I have formed this eſtimate according to the ſtate of things in England; but it is well known that wages and the price of labour in general, are much higher in America than in England. Labour muſt neceſſarily be dear in every country where land is cheap, and large tracts of it unſettled, as is the caſe here. Hence an American regiment coſts us <hi>double</hi> what a Britiſh regiment, of equal number, coſts Britain. Were it proper to be explicit, and deſcend to particulars, I could evince this paſt all poſſibility of doubt; and I appeal for the truth of it to thoſe gentlemen among us who are acquainted with theſe matters.</p>
            <p>Where the money is to come from which will defray this enormous annual expence of <hi>three millions,</hi> ſterling, and all thoſe other debts, I know not; unleſs the author of <hi>Common Senſe,</hi> or ſome other ingenious projector, can diſcover the <hi>Philoſopher's Stone,</hi> by which iron and other baſe metals may be tranſmuted into gold. Certain I am, that our commerce and agriculture, the two principal ſources of our wealth, will not ſupport ſuch an expence. The whole of our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports from the Thirteen United Colonies in the year 1769, amounted only to £.2,887,898 ſterl.<note n="*" place="bottom">See <hi>Campbell's Political Survey of Great-Britain,</hi> Vol. 2.</note>; which is not ſo much, by near half a million, as our annual expence would be, were we Independent of Great-Britain. Thoſe exports, with no inconſiderable part of the profits ariſing from them, it is well known, centered finally in Britain, to pay the merchants and manufacturers there for goods we had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported thence; and yet left us ſtill in debt! What then muſt our ſituation be, or what the ſtate of our trade, when op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with ſuch a burthen of annual expence! When eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry article of commerce, every neceſſary of life, together with our lands, muſt be heavily taxed, to defray that expence!</p>
            <p>Such is the load of debt and expence we ſhould incur by this Writer's hopeful exchange of our connection with Great
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:014809_0059_0F94DAE1B956C988"/>
Britain for Independency and Republicaniſm! And all this, after being exhauſted by a tedious war, and perhaps our ſhipping and ſea-ports deſtroyed! This is a very ſerious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; which is obvious to every underſtanding, and which no ſophiſtry can evade. All who have any prudence or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe left, or any property to loſe, will pauſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider well, before they plunge themſelves into ſuch a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſituation. How little do thoſe who deſire this ſituation, know what they are about, or what they deſire.</p>
            <p>Our author frequently refers us to Holland, as if that were the only land of liberty—crowned with every bleſſing, and exempt from every evil. But hear a little plain truth. The national debt of Holland is much greater, in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than that of England. The taxes in Holland far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed not only thoſe in England, but even thoſe in France, inſomuch that a certain writer declares he ſcarcely knows any thing they have which has eſcaped taxation, "except the air they breathe." Navy more,—the people at large have no voice in chuſing the members of their ſeveral Senates, as we have in chuſing Repreſentatives. The members of each Senate, upon any vacancy, elect new members; and the deputies from thoſe Senates, conſtitute the <hi>States Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</hi> So that in fact, the people have no ſhare in the government, as with us; "they have nothing to do but pay and grumble," as Lord Cheſterfield obſerves. Yet this is the country our author holds up for imitation; and if we were to follow his advice, I have not the leaſt doubt but we ſhould ſoon reſemble them in paying heavy taxes, as well as in every other matter.</p>
            <p>But here it may be ſaid—<hi>That all the evils above ſpecified, are more tolerable than ſlavery.</hi> With this ſentiment I ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely agree—any hardſhips, however great, are preferable to ſlavery. But then I aſk, is there no other alternative in the preſent caſe? Is there no choice left us but ſlavery, or thoſe evils? I am confident there is; and that both may be equally avoided? Let us only ſhew a diſpoſition to treat or negociate in earneſt—let us fall upon ſome method to ſet a treaty or negociation with Great Britain on foot; and if once properly begun, there is a moral certainly that this
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:014809_0060_0F94DAE27957BBB8"/>
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy diſpute will be ſettled to the mutual ſatisfaction and intereſt of both countries. For my part, I have not the leaſt doubt about it.</p>
            <p>It would be improper and needleſs for me to enlarge on the particulars that ſhould be adjuſted at ſuch a treaty. The matureſt deliberation will be neceſſary on the occaſion, as well as a generous regard to every part of the Empire, I ſhall juſt beg leave to ſuggeſt my opinion on a few points—I think America ſhould inſiſt, that the claim of parliament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary taxation be either explicitly relinquiſhed; or elſe, ſuch ſecurity given as the caſe will admit, and may be equivalent to a formal relinquiſhment, that this claim ſhall not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted. When this moſt important point is gained, America ſhould conſider, that there is a great difference between having her money wreſted from her by others, and not giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any of it herſelf, when it is proper to give. While ſhe is protected, and ſhares in the advantages reſulting from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a part of the Britiſh Empire, ſhe ſhould contribute ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for that protection and thoſe advantages; and I never heard a ſenſible American deny this. Moreover, ſhe ſhould ſtipulate for ſuch a freedom of trade as is conſiſtent with the general welfare of the State; and that this intereſting object be ſettled in ſuch a manner as to preclude, as much as poſſible, any impolitic, or injurious infringements here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. All this may be eaſily done, if both ſides are only diſpoſed for peace; and there are many other particulars which would be exceedingly beneficial to America, and might be obtained, as they could not interfere with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of Great Britain or any other part of the empire. We have abundant proof of this as well as ſeveral good hints to proceed on, in the late conceſſions to Nova-Scotia from government.</p>
            <p>But it may be aſked—what probability is there that Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain will enter on ſuch a treaty, or liſten to propoſals of this kind? Is ſhe not preparing for war, and fitting out a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable armament againſt the colonies? I anſwer—there is every reaſon to believe that ſhe will enter on ſuch a treaty, if it is deſired; and that ſhe will liſten to reaſonable propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals. It is her intereſt to do ſo. To hold theſe colonies
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:014809_0061_0F94DAE339531450"/>
by the ſword only, were ſhe ever ſo powerful, would be holding them by a very precarious, expenſive tenure. Such a Union with the Colonies as well promote their intereſt equally with her's, is the only effectual way of attaching them to her. Is it reaſonable to ſuppoſe that Great Britain does not ſee this? Or that ſhe is not ſenſible of it? Beſides, it has been openly and expreſsly declared in Parliament that <hi>taxation is given up</hi> by the Miniſtry; we are alſo aſſured that ſome very reſpectable names have been lately added to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates of America; and Commiſſioners have been appointed to treat with us. All theſe things are in our favour, and promiſe a proſperous iſſue to a negociation, if once begun. The Britiſh armament will not in the leaſt impede a treaty. Belligerent-Powers, when on the eve of peace, always make as vigorous preparations for war, as if there was no thoughts of peace. America alſo is preparing for war, which is no more than a prudent ſtep. It need not prevent her from treating; and ſhe may thereby obtain better terms.</p>
            <p>But a Declaration for Independency on the part of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, would preclude treaty intirely; and could anſwer no good purpoſe. We actually have already every advantage of Independency, without its inconveniences. By a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Independency, we ſhould inſtantly loſe all aſſiſtance from our friends in England. It would ſtop their mouths; for were they to ſay any thing in our favour, they would be deemed rebels, and treated accordingly.</p>
            <p>Our author is much elated with the proſpect of foreign ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, if we once declare ourſelves Independent; and from thence promiſeth us mighty matters. This, no doubt, is intended to ſpirit up the deſponding—all who might ſhrink at the thought of America encountering, ſingly and unſupported, the whole ſtrength of Great-Britain. I believe in my conſcience, that he is as much miſtaken in this, as in any thing elſe; and that this expectation is deluſive, vain and fallacious. My reaſons are theſe, and I ſubmit them to the readers judgement.</p>
            <p>The only European power from which we can poſſibly receive aſſiſtance, is France. But France is now at peace with Great-Britain; and is it probable that France would interrupt that peace, and hazard a war with the power which lately
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:014809_0062_0F94DAE3F959D2E0"/>
reduced her ſo low, from a <hi>diſintereſted</hi> motive of aiding and protecting theſe Colonies? The fate of Corſica may teach us how <hi>ready</hi> European ſtates are to act on <hi>diſintereſted</hi> motives, in ſuch caſes. France has now a pacific King; her finances are in a very ruinous ſtate; both which circumſtances will naturally tend to keep her quiet. If it be ſaid—That the excluſive trade of America would be a ſufficient inducement for France to engage on our ſide—I anſwer—That ſhe never can have our excluſive trade, till the power of Great-Britain is totally annihilated. Now, ſuppoſing France were able to effect this—(a ſuppoſition not very probable)—yet the other European ſtates are too jealous of her—too deeply intereſted in preſerving a due ballance of power, which is a principal object in European politics, ever to ſuffer ſuch an event to take place.</p>
            <p>It is well known that ſome of the French and Spaniſh Coloniſts, not long ſince, offered to put themſelves under the protection of England, and declare themſelves Independent of France and Spain; but England rejected both offers. The example would be rather dangerous to ſtates that have colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies—to none could it be more ſo than to France and Spain, who have ſo many and ſuch extenſive colonies. <q>The practice of courts are as much againſt us</q> in this, as in the inſtance our author mentions. Can any one ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that becauſe we declared ourſelves Independent of England, France would <hi>therefore</hi> conſider us as really Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent! And before England had acquieſced, or made any effort worth mentioning to reduce us? Or can any one be ſo weak as to think, that France would run the riſque of a war with England, unleſs ſhe (France) were ſure of ſome extraordinary advantage by it, in having the colonies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her <hi>immediate juriſdiction?</hi> If England will not protect us for our trade, ſurely France will not.</p>
            <p>But I have ſome <hi>facts</hi> to alledge further on this head, which will have great weight with all ſober, diſpaſſionate perſons. As for thoſe who give themſelves up to paſſion and prejudice, they are ſcarcely capable of judging. Like men who are drawn in and whirled about, by ſome impetuous vortex, they have loſt the proper command of themſelves.</p>

The ſeveral European ſtates who have colonies on this continent, or the adjacent iſlands, are exceedingly jealous of thoſe colonies, left they ſhould aſpire to independency. He muſt be totally ignorant of the ſtate of things in Europe who is not ſenſible of this. The great diſtance of America from Europe contributes to raiſe that jealouſy; and it is height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by our growing ſtrength and importance, and our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizing ſpirit. Hence it was that France lately ſent ſuch a number of regular troops to Martinico; and diſarmed all the inhabitants, to whom the defence of that iſland was chiefly committed formerly. The profeſſed reaſon for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arming the inhabitants was to prevent their joining the North Americans in their conteſt with Great-Britain. This infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation comes from a gentleman who was then at Martinico, and lately arrived on this continent. The inhabitants of the French Weſt-Indies, it is probable, would willingly join us, and ſhake off the deſpotic yoke under which they groan; but this diſpoſition in them will only ſerve to alarm France the more, and induce the latter to oppoſe, rather than aſſiſt us.</p>
            <p>Diſcountenancing <hi>our</hi> independency by France, would only be ſuch a return as Britain will naturally expect, and moſt probably receive, for a ſimilar conduct in her to the French inhabitants of Hiſpaniola. Not long after the concluſion of the late war, thoſe inhabitants were driven by the moſt gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring oppreſſion, to take up arms. The French Governor applied for aſſiſtance to the Engliſh Admiral, then on the Weſt-India ſtation. Several ſhips were ſent immediately by the latter, with the promiſe of more, if neceſſary. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection was quelled by the Governor's inſidiouſly drawing the leaders of the inſurrection into a treaty, and then making priſoners of them—a circumſtance not very inviting to place much faith in French promiſes or generoſity.</p>
            <p>The King of Denmark's late proclamation, in which he declares, that <hi>the eſtates of ſuch of his ſubjects as ſhall join the Americans, will be forfeited,</hi> is a further proof of the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of European powers, who have ſettlements in America.</p>
            <p>Let any man calmly reflect on theſe particulars; and then judge whether it is probable that France or any other Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:014809_0064_0F94DAE579681F08"/>
ſtate that has profeſſions on this quarter of the globe, will contribute to erect an independent empire in America; eſpecially when it is conſidered, that this new empire, from its proximity, muſt, ſooner or later, infallibly ſwallow up thoſe poſſeſſions. I am firmly of opinion, that our Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Independency will have an effect directly contrary to what our author ſuggeſts, and what ſome warm people expect. I think it infinitely more likely that it will produce a coalition or treaty between the ſeveral European nations, who have ſettlements in America, to guarantee and ſecure their reſpective ſettlements to each other; than that any of theſe nations will co-operate with our deſign, and thereby lend a hand to injure themſelves.</p>
            <p>Nay, further; I can whiſper a ſecret to the author of <hi>Common Senſe,</hi> provided he will let it go no further—which is—That France and Spain have <hi>actually made an offer of their aſſiſtance</hi> to Great-Britain, in the preſent conteſt with the Colonies. This intelligence comes from ſuch authority as would remove all doubt about the matter, even from our zealous Republican, were I at liberty to mention that autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>Indeed were France ever ſo willing and able to aſſiſt us, the experiment would be imprudent in us, and hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the higheſt degree. There is ſcarcely an inſtance recorded in hiſtory of Foreigners being called in to aſſiſt in domeſtic quarrels, that it did not prove ruinous to thoſe that ſought their aid. The ancient Britons invited the Saxons to aſſiſt them againſt the Picts—the Picts were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued; and the Britons enſlaved. One inſtance more I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forbear mentioning. The Etolians and other Greek ſtates called in the Romans to aſſiſt them againſt Philip of Macedon, one of Alexander's Succeſſors. Philip was redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; and the Roman yoke was impoſed on the Grecian ſtates. Senſible of their error, when it was too late, and anxious for deliverance from the Romans, the Etolians applied for Aid to Antiochus, who then poſſeſſed the remains of Alexander's Aſiatic Dominions. The Romans now em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed Philip to ſubdue Antiochus and the Etolians, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had employed the Etolians to ſubdue Philip. The
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:014809_0065_0F94DAE639D38B08"/>
Roman yoke was more confirmed and made heavier. Were we to call in France on this occaſion; and ſhould our uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted force ſucceed againſt Britain, ſomething ſimilar to this would probably follow.</p>
            <p>I have heard the caſe of Holland's revolt from Spain, and Queen Elizabeth's affording aid to the former, mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as parallel to ours. But inſtead of being parallel, the caſes differ in every circumſtance. Elizabeth, embarraſſed greatly by Roman Catholics at home, was then at war with Philip IId. of Spain—a cruel, gloomy tyrant, who had late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly introduced the inquiſition into the low countries, where hundreds of his proteſtant ſubjects were ſacrificed by that bloody court. This was the real cauſe of the Dutch revolt; though civil matters partly mingled with it. Elizabeth by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting the Dutch, ſerved two important purpoſes. One was to protect the proteſtants who were every where threatned with deſtruction. The other was, to diſtreſs her implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enemy, who aimed at no leſs than the utter ruin of her religion, crown and kingdom. The Dutch ſtates offered Elizabeth the ſovereignty of their country; but ſhe refuſed it, having no deſign of that ſort. It is more than probable the French king would not be ſo diſintereſted, modeſt and ſelf-denying as Elizabeth was, were we to make him the like offer. Such was the caſe of Holland; yet ſome have been ſo ſilly as to compare our preſent caſe with that of the Dutch.</p>
            <p>Conſider this matter as you will, view the Declaration of Independency in what light you pleaſe; the ruin of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca muſt be the inevitable conſequence. Our author's ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs and zeal therefore, that we ſhould declare ourſelves Independent, ſerves only to prove that he himſelf is deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; and that he would gladly bring this whole continent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame ſituation.</p>
            <p>But our author repeatedly tells us—<q>That to expend ſo many millions for the ſake of getting a few vile acts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed, is unworthy of the charge.</q> Now to paſs over the groſs inſult here offered to the Continental Congreſs, who had this important object principally in view, in the ſpirited meaſures they have taken: I anſwer—That if five times as many millions had been expended, America would be an
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:014809_0066_0F94DAE6F98766D8"/>
immenſe gainer, provided thoſe acts are repealed, and her liberties, property, and trade, and ſettled on a firm baſis, by a Conſtitutional Union with Great-Britain. Were that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure once effected, the peace and proſperity of this continent would be as immutably and certainly ſecure as any thing in this world can. We ſhould be the happieſt people in the world. The Americans have fully evinced, to the convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the moſt incredulous, that they have an high ſenſe of their liberties, and ſufficient ſpirit to vindicate thoſe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties. Their numbers, ſtrength, and importance, will be daily increaſing; theſe will command reſpect from Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Britain, and inſure to them a mild and equitable treatment from her. She will not hereafter be over anxious to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, or come to blows with them. This I think is clear to demonſtration; and hence we may learn to ſet a proper value on the rant which this author throws out, as if Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica would be perpetually embroiled with England hereafter, unleſs we declare for independency.</p>
            <p>For my part, I look upon this pamphlet to be the moſt injurious, in every reſpect, to America, of any that has appeared ſince theſe troubles began. Its natural and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary tendency is, to produce jealouſy, diſſention and diſunion among us. The Continental Congreſs, the ſeveral Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Congreſſes and Aſſemblies, have all unanimouſly and in the ſtrongeſt terms, diſclaimed every idea of Independency. They have repeatedly declared their abhorrence of ſuch a ſtep; they have as often declared their firm attachment to our Sovereign and the Parent State. They have declared that placing them in the ſame ſituation that they were at the cloſe of the laſt war, was their only object; that when this was done, by repealing the obnoxious acts, our former har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and friendſhip would be reſtored. I appeal to the reader whether all this has not been done from one end of the continent to the other.</p>
            <p>Yet here ſteps forth a writer, who avers with as much aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance as if he had the whole continent at his back, and ready to ſupport his aſſeverations.—That Independency is our duty and intereſt—That it was folly and raſhneſs to go to the expence we have been at for ſake of repealing thoſe
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:014809_0067_0F94DAE7B9700678"/>
obnoxious acts; and moreover, loads with the moſt oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious terms, that Sovereign and Nation to which we had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared our attachment! In what light can this be viewed in Britain? Muſt it not weaken the influence of our friends—ſtrengthen the hands of the miniſtry—and give weight to every thing our enemies have ſaid to our diſadvantage? Muſt it not induce people to ſuſpect our candour—that all our declarations were inſincere, fallacious—intended only to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſe and deceive?—It is as much to vindicate my injured countrymen from this diſgrace, which they deſerve not, as to oppoſe the deſtructive project of Independency, that I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear on this occaſion—a project which is as <hi>new</hi> as it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive.</p>
            <p>I have now conſidered every thing in this Incendiary's pamphlet, that deſerves notice. If ſome things are paſſed over, it is not becauſe they are unanſwerable; but becauſe they are not worthy of an anſwer. I have on purpoſe omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted every ſubject, the diſcuſſion of which might tend to raiſe jealouſy among the coloniſts; ſuch as religion, the claims of ſome colonies on others, beſides many more of the ſame kind. But it was more difficult to avoid ſpeaking of theſe, than to point out what prolific ſources of animoſity, bitterneſs and bloody conteſts they muſt infallibly prove, were America to become independent. The whole is freely ſubmitted to the reader's candid, diſpaſſionate judgment.</p>
            <p>The Author of <hi>Common Senſe</hi> may probably call me <q>a diſguiſed tory, a prejudiced man,</q> or what in his eſtimation <q>will be productive of more calamities to this continent than all others—a moderate man.</q> But I am too conſcious of the ſincerity of my own heart, and of the rectitude of my intentions, to pay any regard to whatever he is pleaſed to call me. Who indeed would be ambitious of his appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, when he expreſsly reprobates Moderation—that offspring of true wiſdom and ſound judgment? The welfare of America is what I wiſh for above any earthly thing. I am fully, firmly and conſcientiouſly perſuaded, that our author's ſcheme of Independency and Republicaniſm, is big with ruin—with inevitable ruin to America. Againſt this ſcheme therefore, which totally changes the ground we ſet
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:014809_0068_0F94DAE8799AE320"/>
out on, as an honeſt man, as a friend to human nature, I muſt and will bear teſtimony.</p>
            <p>Let the ſpirit, deſign and motives which are undeniably evident in our reſpective pamphlets, decide which ſhould be attended to moſt.</p>
            <p>The author of <hi>Common Senſe</hi> is a violent ſtickler for Democracy or Republicaniſm only—every other ſpecies of government is reprobated by him as tyrannical: <hi>I</hi> plead for that conſtitution which has been formed by the wiſdom of ages—is the admiration of mankind—is beſt adapted to the genius of Britons, and is moſt friendly to liberty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He</hi> takes pleaſure in aggravating every circumſtance of our unhappy diſpute—would inſpire others with the ſame rage that inſtigates himſelf, and would ſet his fellow ſubjects to cutting each others throats. <hi>I</hi> would moſt gladly, were it in my power, draw a veil of eternal oblivion over any er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors which Great Britain or the colonies may have fallen into—I would willingly perſuade them to mutual harmony and union; ſince on theſe their mutual happineſs and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt depend.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He</hi> is evidently goaded on by ambition and reſentment, to ſeek for the gratification of thoſe paſſions in an independent republic here; which would reduce America to the ſame deſperate ſtate with himſelf: <hi>I</hi> have no intereſt to ſerve but what is common to my countrymen—but what every Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican of property is concerned in equally with me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He</hi> places himſelf at the head of a party; and ſpurns from him with the utmoſt contempt and indignation, all who will not enliſt under his banner: <hi>I</hi> am of no party, but ſo far as the welfare of America is aimed at; and I believe there are many who aim at this in every party. I have not learnt to pace with ſuch intire acquieſcence in the trammels of any party, as not to deſert it, the moment it deſerts the intereſt of my country.</p>

               <hi>He</hi> recommends a new, untried romantic ſcheme, at which we would at firſt have ſhuddered—which is big with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable ruin, and is the laſt ſtage of political phrenzy. <hi>I</hi> am for purſuing the ſame object, and acting on the ſame princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and plan with which we ſet out, when this conteſt began, and of whoſe ſucceſs there is a moral certainty.</p>

This, as far as I can know or ſee, is the true ſtate of our caſe—let Heaven and Earth judge between us.</p>
            <p>America is far from being yet in a deſperate ſituation. I am confident ſhe may obtain honourable and advantagious terms from Great Britain. A few years of peace will ſoon retrieve all her loſſes. She will rapidly advance to a ſtate of maturity, whereby ſhe may not only repay the parent ſtate amply for all paſt benefits; but alſo lay under the greateſt obligations. America, till very lately, has been the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt country in the univerſe. Bleſt with all that nature could beſtow with the profuſeſt bounty, ſhe enjoyed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, more liberty, greater privileges than any other land. How painful is it to reflect on theſe things, and to look for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the gloomy proſpects now before us! But it is not too late to hope that matters may mend. By prudent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement her former happineſs may again return; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to encreaſe for ages to come, in a union with the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſtate.</p>
            <p>However diſtant humanity may wiſh the period; yet, in the rotation of human affairs, a period may arrive, when, (both countries being prepared for it) ſome terrible diſaſter, ſome dreadful convulſion in Great Britain, may transfer the ſeat of empire to this weſtern hemiſphere—where the Britiſh conſtitution, like the Phoenix from its parent's aſhes, ſhall riſe with youthful vigour and ſhine with redoubled ſplendor.</p>
            <p>But if America ſhould now miſtake her real intereſt—if her ſons, infatuated with romantic notions of conqueſt and empire, ere things are ripe, ſhould adopt this repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican's ſcheme: They will infalibly deſtroy this ſmiling pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. They will diſmember this happy country—make it a ſcene of blood and ſlaughter, and entail wretchedneſs and miſery on millions yet unborn.</p>
