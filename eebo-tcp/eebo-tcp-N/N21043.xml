            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A DISSERTATION, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE mind and body although widely different in themſelves, yet they are ſo formed, and wonderfully uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in us, that the one may be affected by the other in reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal ſympathy.</p>
            <p>So intimate is this exiſting connection, that every ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the mind, in a manner affects the body, the one, therefore, will be affected by the diſeaſes of the other. Every perſon muſt be ſenſible of the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ections of the will, nor was the pride of the Stoics free from this, although they denied theſe affections to interrupt their divine wiſdom. Philoſophers, therefore, feigned to know many things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſeat of the will in the body. Ariſtotle and the Peripatetics, placed it in the heart, and the ancients in the brain. Plato divided and diſtinguiſhed all the paſſions into two, the covetous and iraſcible, the former he placed in the heart, the latter in the liver. There are ſome again who divide the various paſſions farther, and give to each affection of the mind ſeparate ſeats. And finally, Helmontius, and Des Cartes, place all the paſſions and faculties collectively; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer in the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> upper orifice of the ſtomach, the latter in
<pb facs="unknown:027638_0005_1026EB2129C1E160"/>
the Pineal gland. That the brain is the ſeat of the mind, is a point, I believe, admitted <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> all <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, but whether occupying that particular part, the Pineal gland, will not be decided here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> either pro or con; but that the mind, will or paſſions, operate upon the corporeal part of our ſyſtem, through the medium of the Nerves, whether conſidered as taking their origin from the Encephalon, or as mere appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dages thereto. All this, I ſay, appears probable from the effects of ligatures, made upon the nerves, and of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of their continuity. It appears that in either, in an entire ſtate, motions may be communicated from the brain to other parts of the ſyſtem, and from the latter to the former; from injuries done the Brain, by either external or internal violence, the laws of ſenſation are impaired, and ſometimes deſtroyed; and from the ſame experiments it would appear, that the Brain is the organ of ſenſation and volition, and of the ſeveral intellectual operations interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between theſe; all which is confirmed by the effects of the organic affection of the Brain upon the intellectual facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>The Brain is thus the ſenſorium or corporeal organ more immediately the ſeat of, or connected with the mind, and ſo far as corporeal organ is employed, all the thoughts ariſing in conſequence of impreſſion are the operations of the Brain and are modified by its various conditions.</p>
            <p>Without entering into a diſcuſſion of the laws of ſenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, either of impreſſion or of conſciouſneſs it is adequate to our purpoſe, to premiſe, that the mind ſeems to be excited by the force of impreſſion, from the pleaſure or pain ariſing from it, by the degree of emotion or paſſion produced by theſe; and by the emotion being more or leſs related to the perſon feeling; and it may not be amiſs to add here, that the mind is capable of receiving but one impreſſion at a time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:027638_0006_1026EB2427411A50"/>With this, it remains for us to conſider how far the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as appendages of the mind are connected with the body and how far they are conducive to health or diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>The paſſions are neceſſary and natural parts of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and by the order of nature they never were intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a ſource of diſeaſe either to body or mind; on the contrary when cauſed to roll within their deſtined orbits, they prove reciprocally ſerviceable to each other.</p>
            <p>As to the body, they preſerve the health of that, not only by exciting us to exerciſe; but likewiſe as an agency and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary ſtimulus to the ſupport of life, by immediately and ſeparately affecting the circulation of the blood, for in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as theſe internal ſenſes are abſent, the motion of the circulating maſs is diminiſhed and the function of ſecretion impeded. Neither is this ſentient principle of itſelf ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, to preſerve a due compoſition and proper aſſimilation of the fluids, for the purpoſes of ſecretion and nutrition. For the plaſtick power of the fluids is ſo great that ſhould it happen that the neceſſary ſtimulus to motion be with-held they may coagulate into a viſcid maſs. This is notified in a deep and protracted ſleep; this ſituation in which the mind reſts, renders the circulation flow and the blood itſelf diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers a diſpoſition to ſtaguate. Hence if the ſleep be ſtill further protracted, the fluids of the body will acquire a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacity that will be difficult to deſtroy, and thereby the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for which they were intended by nature will be defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Neither ought theſe injuries to be aſcribed alone to the body's being in a ſtate of reſt, but to an inſenſibility or inactivity of the paſſions. The ſame ſpace of time is paſſed by perſons in a ſtate of watchfulneſs, the paſſions then in a ſtate of imperfect action, without any exerciſe of the body, when the fluids are neither rendered viſcid nor the circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion retarded.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:027638_0007_1026DC0DA66B6B30"/>It is equally certain that ſome of the paſſions diminiſh the circulation of the blood, and produce a temporary ſuſpenſion of the ſecretions. If theſe are not truly immoderate and of long continuance they may be quickly removed, by a reſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation of the more alert paſſions of the mind.</p>
            <p>And here it is to be remarked that theſe two kinds of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which we will call the <hi>impelling</hi> or <hi>repelling</hi> or in other words, thoſe that increaſe and thoſe that diminiſh the power of the vital and natural functions, which are very wiſely and curiouſly to be oppoſed to each other, by which means, the one can be moderated, and corrected by the other. For if the mind is acted upon always by the more vivid and more active ſenſes; the ſpirits will be exhauſted, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citability will be worn down ſo far as to be but little influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the moſt powerful ſtimuli of any kind. But the <hi>repelling</hi> or debilitating check this unnatural and diſeaſed ſtate of excitement, ſtrike an equilibrium, and reduce the ſyſtem to the ſtandard of health.</p>
            <p>Such appear to be the reſulting convenience of the paſſions, when curbed, and kept within due bounds. But as all things are put in a worſe ſituation when changed from a law of nature; ſo, the paſſions when they exceed either way their certain order and limits, they become diſſolute and ought to be avoided; not becauſe they diſturb the tranquility of the mind alone, but as they injure the temperament of the body. They, with a rapid and tumultuous impetus preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate the motion of the blood and ſpirits, or diminiſh their energy ſo far as entirely to ſubdue them. Again, they violently contract or immoderately relax the ſolids.</p>
            <p>Theſe few things being premiſed, we next proceed to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh each paſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but previouſly it will not be improper to obſerve, that it is not my intention in the following pages

            <p>When joy ſeizes the breaſt, the heart ſuddenly leaps, the eyes ſhine with ſplendour, the cheeks partake of a beautiful redneſs and an ornamenting light beams on the countenance; The body is agreeably relaxed, and a proportion of blood, exciting the moſt pleaſing ſenſations, is thrilled to the moſt remote part of the ſyſtem. But, although, the impetus of the blood be increaſed, it muſt be obſerved, that this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection has not that influence upon the arterial ſyſtem that diſpoſes it to febrile action, but ſuch a warmth is induced only, as proves grateful. A tone of the ſolids conſiſtent with health, moſt generally attends at the ſame time the circulation becomes equable, and in a ſtate proportionate to the ſtate of the ſolids. It frequently produces a flow of tears, which generally ſerves to relieve nature, and are moſtly accompanied with high mental gratification.

Hence the neceſſity of imparting good news gradually and accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dating ſtimulus to excitability. The celebrated Boerhaave affords us an inſtance of the effects of immoderate joy in a girl, and hiſtory gives us many caſes of the ſame ſort. The ſtory of the Roman mother is well known, who was bewailing the death of her ſon, he ſuddenly and unexpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly appeared, the mother dropped down dead the inſtant he entered the apartment.

            <p>When accidentally the form of a Venus has been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to our view, love ſeems to ariſe within us, gradually, all warmth is cauſed to vaniſh from the mind, the flow and tumult of the paſſions, ſubſide, and the affected languiſh into all pleaſantneſs and ſoftneſs; and harmony, with her ſilver train, ornaments all his walks.

Nor is there wanting a conſentaneous emotion of the body, a gentle ſenſation creeps through all the nervous ſyſtem, the circulation becomes equable, and the ſolids are reduced to an agreeable degree of relaxation. Such are the effects of Love in its primitive and incipient ſtages, before it has made impreſſions of a permanent and fixed nature. But when it becomes deeper ſented, it diſturbs the ſerenity of the mind, and the general economy of the body—the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance then becomes hung over with languor, the eyes indicate ſome remarkable deſire; the breaſt riſes and falls like the diſturbed waters of the ocean, with deep and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing ſighs. The body becomes effeminated, and it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks every manly power of the ſoul. The afflicted perſon is particularly agitated when in preſence of the beloved object. The heart leaps, and its Syſtole and Dyaſtole is repeated with increaſed rapidity; the pulſe performs an inordinate action; the countenance at firſt is ſuffuſed with redneſs and then ſuddenly becomes pale.

From the beginning the induced debility and effeminacy, the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious perturbations, which immediately follow, cannot be ſuſtained without the greateſt agitation of both body and mind. But the irregular and deſultory flow of the ſpirits, the inequable flow of the blood, and the diſordered ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which invariably take place, ſo far derange and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſt the whole ſyſtem, that frequently this ſtate ends in an incurable Tabes: Thus, the emperor Antiochus, ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pined away, the cauſe of his diſeaſe being kept a ſecret from his Phyſicians. When this paſſion exceeds the bounds aſcribed to it by nature, and the object of his wiſhes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be obtained, it ſometimes induces melancholia, and ſometimes mania; varying agreeable to the temperament of the body, and alſo according to the degree of excite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when this diſappointment is made.</p>
            <p>Hope exhilerates the mind to a grateful anticipation; from whence appears in the body the more placid effects of a lenient joy.

When this paſſion has reached its ſummit, the eyes are forced forward, and made protuberant, they burn with envy, the muſcles of the forehead, ſupercilia, and of all the face are thrown into violent and contorted poſitions, the blood burſts into the face, the lips take on the tremulous motion, the voice is thick and ſtammering. Anger excites and contracts all

the moving fibres, the muſcular ſtrength at one time is doubly encreaſed, and at another its power is very much diminiſhed, different in different perſons, according to their ſeveral conſtitutions; it accelerates the motion and increaſes the impetus of the blood. All theſe cauſes conſpiring, the veſſels are thrown into febrile action. In this apparently univerſal conſtriction, the Rima Glottidis is ſpaſmodically affected, and the voice becomes rough and violent; during this ſituation of the Glottis the ſalivary glands diſcharge copiouſly, with a frothing at the mouth, which ſymptoms often accompany this furor. Hence alſo the proportion of air neceſſary to the inflation of the Lungs, being withheld, the return of the blood by the Jugular veins and deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cava, of courſe muſt be conſiderably impeded, the countenance becomes fluſhed, and ſometimes of a livid hue, to the ſame power of contraction as mentioned above, the corrugation and contorſion of the muſcles muſt be owing. Anger much increaſes perſpiration and all the different ſecretions of the body, an increaſed ſecretion and diſcharge of bile very frequently follow, with contortions of the Abdominal Viſcera. By this ſtrong action and reaction of the veſſels and their contents, recent and ſometimes long confirmed Cicatrices are torn aſunder. Again, it is frequently attended, or rather there is conſequent to it apoplexy, pleuriſy, haemorrhages, phrenites, violent fever, and in females, a ſuppreſſion of milk, and cancerous affections of the Mammae; but to theſe odious and diſagreeable hoſts, both to body and mind, there ſometimes follow great debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, langour and depreſſion; as the turbulent ocean ſinketh into a calm.</p>

the eyes roll with uncertain hope, the aſtoniſhed heart leaps, the joints tremble and withdraw from their deſtined duty, a cold clammy ſweat is diſcharged from every pore of the body. Fear is ſeen to repel and debilitate the powers of life, ſometimes its influence has quite a different effect; but generally univerſal debility, chills, trepidation, and relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the different ſphincters of the body. The periſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic motion of the inteſtines is increaſed, diarrhea<note n="*" place="bottom">Falconer, page 39.</note>, Icterus, and ſchirrus gangrene have been noticed as the effects of fear. It weakens the power of digeſtion, and cauſes flatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, eructations, acidity and other concomitants of dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pepſia. By this depreſſion of ſpirits, a neceſſary ſtimulus to life and more particularly of health is ſuſpended; by this means alſo the power of the Heart and Arteries to propel the blood to their extremities is diminiſhed, the blood con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently is accumulated about the Heart and Lungs, a ſmall quick pulſe indicant of this oppreſſion generally attends. This ſtate remaining untill it is aſſiſted by the intervention of ſome potent ſtimulus, ſufficient to enable her to propel the blood to the ſuperficies; to this follows an increaſed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of heat, followed by perſpiration, analogous to the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of nature in an intermittent fever. When, as yet its violence remains, and terror is pronounced, it does not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the power of the ſpirits, but on the contrary inſtigates them to ſtrong and powerful endeavours, it excites the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent energy of the ſyſtem into vigorous action, and whilſt theſe tumultuous and irregular exertions are kept up, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears as if all oppoſition would be compelled to yield. <hi>Non Vultus non calor unus.</hi> It has a remarkable effect in render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe, under its influence, more liable to the infection of contagious diſeaſes.

fear, and marks them as the moſt powerful cauſes. And aſſerts that it is owing to this circumſtance that fevers and alvine fluxes are ſo fatal to young adventurers, who annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally emigrate in expectation of acquiring riches, and upon their arrival, finding all their deluſive hope ſuddenly diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated, they become low ſpirited, and are carried off in a very few hours. Whilſt others as little inured to the cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and expoſed to the ſame remote cauſes, but who have better proſpects, either eſcape the epidemic or have it in a leſs malignant form, when attacked.</p>
            <p>When the impreſſion has been very ſtrong, tremors, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, palſey, apoplexy blindneſs, abortions, disjunctions of the futures of the cranium and death itſelf have been the melancholy conſequences. Sometimes however its effects have been inſtrumental to the cure of many of the ſerious af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of our frail machine; Pains of the body and maniacal diſorders have frequently been removed by inſpiring ideas of fear and apprehenſion of danger—By this however it cannot be denied but that this paſſion, when highly excited will prove a moſt powerful ſtimulant. Violent exertions of ſtrength have been ſhewn, ſpeech has been reſtored to the dumb, and ſtrength to the parylytic patient. Gout, ſciati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, intermittent fevers, diarrhea, and epilepſey have in turn been cured, and perſons on the brink of eternity have been reſtored by it.</p>
            <p>Fear and grief combined with anger, when frequent and long continued, debilitate the whole body, ſuppreſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration and diminiſh the vital heat, hence there follows dropſey, palſey, and many cronic diſeaſes, that render the perſon a burthen to himſelf and friends the remainder of his miſerable exiſtence.</p>

            <p>In this, the eye-brows and forehead, are elevated, the eyes behold every object with the utmoſt diſdain and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, the breaſt and face become tumid, the deportment of body firm and elevates itſelf as it were on high; which we poſſeſs either as the gift of nature or of fortune; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to its origin it renders them more or leſs chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, expands and fills the heart with warm blood, but as there is always joined to this ſome <hi>niſus</hi> of the mind, to ſupport its ſuppoſed dignity, ſo it increaſes the impetus of the blood, gives an increaſed tone to the muſcular ſyſtem but more particularly to the muſcles of the face and upper extremities; pride reſiſts the effects of the more relaxing paſſions, but it may be too much indulged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thereby give too much ragidity to the different fibres of the ſyſtem, and hence by the frequent renewal of it, that ſtate which verges upon anger being kept up, the high degree of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement exiſting at the ſame time in the veſſels of the brain, either terminates in the melancholy diſeaſes produced by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger itſelf or in an obſtinate collapſe; or in other words in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct debility is induced in the brain as in other parts of our complicated machine; and may it not be owing to theſe two ſtates that the conſequent diſeaſes are of ſo oppoſite a nature, ſometimes melancholy and at others mania, either of a tonic or atonic deſcription?</p>
            <p>Shame ſuffuſes the countenance and breaſts with a red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and glowing heat, the lips tremble, the knees ſhake, the eyes are dejected, and the voice clings to the jaws.

<pb n="22" facs="unknown:027638_0017_1026EB3CAEC9D438"/>
pride, for it ariſes from the bad, abject opinion we have formed of ourſelves. Whereas pride gives temporary ſtrength to our whole ſyſtem, and particularly to the head neck, and ſuperior extremities, on the contrary when theſe parts are under the influence of ſhame, they are in a ſtate of relaxation, as muſt be conſpicuouſly evident, from the poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the muſcles of the face and upper extremities as above deſcribed. Hence a larger proportion of blood is tranſmitted to the head, and the face is rendered more red than natural. And may it not be from the ſame cauſe that this degree of perturbation of the brain and moſt of the ſenſes as well external as internal, ariſes<note n="*" place="bottom">In the ſudden flow of blood to the face, when un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the influence of ſhame, may not the mind have a power of ſtimulating the arteries, of a particular part and increaſe their oſciliatory motion, in the ſame manner that the motion of the heart is increaſed by any violent affection of the mind, or in the ſame manner that any named muſcle of the body is brought into action by the will, and very frequently this motion takes place without the preſence of the will, which occaſionally may be the caſe with the arteries in time of bluſhing?</note>? This mode of account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the ſymptoms of ſhame, appear to be ſomewhat ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, from its appearing more frequently in the younger part of the human ſpecies, in whom the ſuperior parts are more relaxed, and in a more irritable ſtate. This affection ſometimes, in Plethoric perſons, terminate in apoplexy.</p>
            <p>There is a ſpecies of joy ariſing from the preſentation of an object to the eye or to the imagination, the incoherency and abſurdity of which produces laughter. The Lungs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe their whole ſtrength, in this convulſive motion, from hence it contributes to increaſe and agitate the whole circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating maſs, and alſo from its having the power of exciting into action the more vivid exertions of the mind as well as body: laughter aids in the removal of melancholia and leu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cophlegmatia. But how far a long continuance of it ſhall

prove detrimental, and be productive of the conſequences incidental to a ſthenic diatheſis ſuddenly induced, muſt be ſufficiently evident. Apoplexy and Peripneumony have ſucceeded this paſſion. Thus Zeuxis is ſaid to have died ſuddenly from the laughter excited by a comic work, the production of his own imagination.</p>
            <p>Pity is that ſenſation of the mind, through which we are affected, by the evils and misfortunes of one or more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; it ſeems to be formed by the union of joy and grief; the one being called forth by afflictions, the other from a tacit approbation of that paſſion; the influence of this up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the different functions of the animal economy is ſo very moderate as to afford little or no interruption. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there is a proportion of grief preſent, yet the mind conſcious of its own rectitude, reſiſts this impend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oppreſſion and keeps up an healthy degree of excitement. Its effects are ſeldom very powerful, but it has been obſerved to have greater influence on the Lachrimal gland, than even ſorrow itſelf.</p>
            <p>Envy diſtorts the mouth, eyes and muſcles of the face, and the whole countenance. It is compoſed of deſire, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and grief: The deſire of a certain gratification, grief at the abſence of that; and anger, pointed at him who poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes that gratification. Theſe diſorderly emotions much derange the ſerenity of the mind, and make appear a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnance through every function of the body. A propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſadneſs conſtituting a proportional part of this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion depreſſes and debilitates the power of both body and mind. Whilſt anger and deſire act their part, the ſyſtem takes on a ſthenic diarheſis; ſhould it ſo happen, that they were alternated, a balance might be ſtruck, and the iſſue would be favorable: but it moſt generally happens that the one or the other mounts the carr and drives on to a ſtate of diſorder. It is ſaid to cauſe paleneſs of the countenance

            <p>As yet there remains one paſſion more to be mentioned which is nearly allied to envy, but more vehement and complicated, namely, Jealouſy. This occaſionally ſhews love, fear, grief, pride, deſire and anger. In the midſt of ſo much contention, how far the ſyſtem muſt be injured, and how far this ought to be held up as the cauſes of many diſeaſes muſt be evident, and I hope ſufficiently ſo, from the influence of theſe ſeveral paſſions when taken in a ſeparate point of view.</p>
            <p>Thoſe moving in a high or public ſphere of life, who are infeſted with honours and perſecuted with ſolicitations, who are obliged to diſſemble their feeling as given them by nature, and live as it were at variance with themſelves, alſo experience in their health the bad effects of ambition, and ſuch diſappointments and unwiſhed for viciſſitudes as are inſeparable from human affairs.</p>
            <p>All theſe ſudden and accidental emotions of the mind affect the corporeal functions openly and at repeated parox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſms. Indeed there are three appetites of an inferior order, namely, luſt, hunger and thirſt; but as they do not take their origin from the mind, and it is only ſecondarily affected, and that they have their influence by the intervention of a certain prediſpoſition of the body, I ſhall therefore omit the conſideration of them here as not appertaining to our ſubject.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:027638_0020_1026EB444DCBF3B0"/>The ſymptoms of the paſſions being ſo far laid down, and I hope with ſufficient accuracy and perſpicuity to prevent their being confounded with each other, I will in the next place endeavour to ſhew in what manner they may be oppoſed to each other with advantage ſo as to keep up or obtain an equilibrium, being the principal preventative againſt their influence as diſpoſing to derangement and diſorder.</p>
            <p>When truly each paſſion ſeparately ſhall be in an immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate degree, they interrupt the functions of the ſyſtem, ſo each has his opponent and rejects or preſides over him in turn. Thus joy is oppoſed to grief; for what the latter ſhall retard the former will accelerate, for as grief re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxes and diminiſhes the mobility of the Hypocondriac re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the contained Viſcern, ſo, laughter, partaking of Joy, ſhakes and agitates theſe parts with a degree of briſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, removes the preſent immobility, gives new tone to their diatheſis, and raiſes the diminiſhed excitement. In a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar manner, love ſoftens the harſh features brought forth by anger, and fear ſuppreſſes what hope excites.</p>
            <p>Such is the wiſe counſel of nature teaching us moderation and the mode of preſerving and procuring an equable tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.

Beſides all this, ſome one of the paſſions muſt prevail, and govern the mind; and every being has his peculiar attachment and inclination to adhere to ſome of theſe affections. With theſe affections, there are generally attending ſome peculiar temperament and habit of body.— But as the mind in this particular, is like the body, which
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:027638_0021_1026EB469412A048"/>
has become accuſtomed to the performance of ſome duty or buſineſs, which it returns to at particular periods, without being diſordered, it bears this ſtimulus without being ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of its impreſſion. Here, the mind, in the ordinary purſuits of buſineſs is habituated to the action of ſome ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus afforded by itſelf; but this being withdrawn or ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeded by one of a different kind, derangement and diſorder are produced, both in body and mind, or in each ſeperately, according to its power.</p>
            <p>In the next piece, I will endeavour to ſhew, how far the paſſions differ from each other in different temperament; and in the firſt place, it appears, that in a ſanguine tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament of the body, the paſſions are more violent, yet quick, and in ſucceſſion more various, the mind is prone to joy, hope and pleaſure. In the choleric they are excited with more difficulty, but when brought into action, they are ſound to be more permanent and violent than in the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine. In theſe various emotions of the mind, when once we allow them to make a deep impreſſion, their viſits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come too often repeated; anger and pride principally come under this deſcription. In melancholy, the emotions of the mind are never violent, but ſlow and conſtant, and always ſad, apprehending ſome impending evil. The Phlegmatic are ſeldom, if ever, troubled with exceſſes of the paſſions of either kind, and ſeldomer indulge the moſt inoffenſive.</p>
            <p>There is ſo intimate a connection of every diſpoſition of the mind, with the peculiar temperament of the body, that when ever a ſpecial diſpoſition of the body is contracted, by the indulgence of ſome one of the paſſions, we neceſſarily induce a conſentaneous temperament of the body; and <hi>vice verſa,</hi> when a particular habit of the body is formed, a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar diſpoſition of mind follows.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:027638_0022_1026EB49038D4188"/>From this mutual connection exiſting between the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the mind and the temperament and habit of body, and from the dependence of the one upon the other, for their reſpective functions, when either is diſeaſed, a remedy for the one will be equally <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> the other. To ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain this, I will recite a few examples.</p>
            <p>In thoſe habits of the body that diſpoſe to melancholy and grief, the mind ſhould be ſtrongly acted upon in the firſt ſituation, nor ought it to be allowed to dwell long upon any one ſubject. Grief, fear, and a too depreſſed opinion of ourſelves, always attend this diſpoſition of the body. So<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> requires a conſiderable proportion of hope and pride, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the depreſſion induced by the former. At the ſame time it will not be thought improper to direct ſuch medicines as will dilute, and increaſe the volume and impetus of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral circulating maſs; and to adminiſter ſuch as will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh the immobility of the nervous power. The cholerie who for the moſt part are daring, proud and cruel ought to be reduced to a ſtate of more lenity, by love and pity, and to be depreſſed by ſhame; in this caſe much good may be done by dilution and the exhibition of ſuch medicines as will take off the exiſting rigidity and lower the general ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> thoſe whoſe habits are warm and ſanguine, whoſe minds are moſt eaſily operated upon, and are affected in the moſt violent manner by the exhilirating paſſions, it not only muſt prove ſerviceable in this caſe, to diminiſh the ſtorm, by oppoſing it with the leſs inebriating emotions of the mind, ſuch as grief and fear, but to leſſen the ſtrength of the moving fibre, and the tone of the arterial ſyſtem, by confining the patient to a refrigerating and low diet. The Phlegmatic, whoſe minds are under the influence of too great a degree of torpor; may be rouſed into action by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and elevated by joy; at the ſame time we ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to excite a diatheſis, verging upon the ſthenic, by the methods beſt known to effectuate that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28"

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>This, I hope, will ſuffice to have been ſaid upon the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent temperaments. A proper regulation of the paſſions muſt avail much in acute and chronic diſeaſes, and appears to be a circumſtance of the utmoſt and laſt importance in their prevention as well as the cure.</p>
            <p>How far a placid and equable temper of mind contributes to the removal of every fever of an acute kind, muſt be evident to every accurate obſerver of nature.</p>
            <p>In ſlow and nervous fevers it is no leſs beneficial to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the mind by inſpiring hope and adding new vigour to the ſyſtem by the welcome news of joy. In all obſtructions, and more particularly the humoral Aſthma, it would ſeem to be a matter of conſiderable importance to excite laughter. For the repeated contractions and convulſions of the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragm may be expedient in removing the infartion of the Lungs. In the ſuppurative ſtage of tubercles of the Lungs, may not this act on prove equally ſerviceable? Thoſe who have obſerved the medicinal virtues of terror, remark that it ſometimes is followed by good effects. But ſince the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of this paſſion has produced very melancholy conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, we ought to have recourſe to an expedient of ſo formidable a nature, with the utmoſt caution, and then, but upon the moſt urgent and deſperate occaſions, as we do in the adminiſtration of every powerful remedy. The uſe made of it in removing Hiccough, is commonly known, and its powerful influence was ſufficiently known to the immortal Boerhaave.</p>
            <p>Beſides all this, the mind demands no leſs attention in the healing of wounds. For the ſtimulating or impelling emotions contribute much to the increaſe of inflammation and ſuppuration; and on the other hand, the debilitating or repelling may and will have a contrary operation. And among the various and many effects of the paſſions upon the
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:027638_0024_1026EB4EE5900720"/>
conſtitution, we muſt not omit to mention of what immenſe application they have been in the prevention of an exacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the intermittent fever, and alſo in aiding the ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem to contend with the contagion of infectious diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>There are worthy of notice, ſome functions of the mind which cannot with the ſtrict rules of order be reduced to the claſs of paſſions, yet of much conſequence to the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, and as an operation of the mind upon the body, may be ſubjoined to what has been mentioned in the foregoing pages. The firſt of theſe is a high degree of faith and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the efficacy of remedies. Whether this operates by engroſſing the mind and attention, and thereby rendering it inacceſſible to other impreſſions, or by imparting ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of tone or ſtrength as enables the ſyſtem to reſiſt their attacks, is difficult to determine; but I am rather inclined to believe that both are concerned, and that they reciprocally aſſiſt each other. This power is found moſt efficacious in ſuch diſorders as recur at intervals. It however, is obſervable that unleſs the prepoſſeſſion is very great, it is apt to fail in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing a cure. Another mental affection which has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced wonderful effects, is a determined reſolution to reſiſt the acceſs of the complaint. However extraordinary this may ſeem, yet that it has been practiſed with great ſucceſs, is a matter beyond doubt. It appears to have its influence in a manner ſimilar to the power laſt ſpoken of, and to have been ſerviceable in nervous and periodical complaints. This appears to be not only a ſtimulus to the nervous ſyſtem, but alſo a general and powerful tonic. And muſt it not be by the agency of this power of the mind, and its influence upon the body that the ſuppoſed poſſeſſors of animal mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netiſm effect ſuch wonderful cures?</p>
            <p>From the view here taken, of the influence of the paſſions upon the corporeal and vital ſyſtems, we may generally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that in caſes where the powers of life are brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:027638_0025_1026EB508AFFB068"/>
the ſtandard of health, endeavours ſhould be made to excite into action ſuch paſſions as will aid in counteracting the leading ſymptoms of the diſeaſe. And when the diſeaſe itſelf conſiſts in, or is agravated by too high a degree of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement of the vital functions, recourſe may be had to the debilitating ones.</p>
            <p>In doing this many difficulties remain yet to be got over, relative to the application of theſe potent and precarious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments; ſince they cannot be brought to Chemical any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſis that we may aſcertain their real and poſſeſſed virtues; neither can we form any judgment of their extent or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, by their effects. For what may have a moderate ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in one economy, may in another be ſufficient, to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the ſyſtem above the wiſhed for point, and be ſucceeded by indirect debility<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſince we are left ſo much in the dark, upon the manner of applying theſe agents, to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of diſeaſes, and the difficulty of exciting them, when wanting, I fear it will be an inſurmountable barrier to their uſe; though we may look forward with pleaſure, to the time, when future ages will ſurmount this obſtacle, and teach us how we are to accommodate theſe remedies to the excitability of the ſyſtem.</p>
