            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>By which charge of <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> our Saviour did not mean, that the Phariſees knew him, and yet denyed him againſt their Conſcience; for he obſerves, That they <hi>did not diſcern the Times,</hi> that is, did not know him, and yet this was an <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> tho' they were not ſenſible of it; for their Power and Advantage blinded them ſo, that they deceived themſelves, and oppoſed his Doctrine out of <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> or guilty Prejudice.</p>

               <p>

               <p>The manner of a Solemn Appeal to God, by Holding up both Hands towards Heaven, was Practiſed by <hi>Moſes,</hi> when the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> Fought with the <hi>Amalekites.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. xvii. 12.</note> And what follows, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains the Reaſon of this Poſture; for after the Lord had promiſed <hi>Moſes Utterly</hi> to Deſtroy <hi>Amaleck, Moſes</hi> ſays, <hi>The Lord hath Sworn,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">16,</note> 
                  <hi>That the Lord will have War with</hi> Amaleck <hi>from Generation to Generation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In which word, the Expreſſion <hi>[The Lord

                  <note place="margin">Mat. v. 34,</note> From whence it is plain, that <hi>Lifting up the Hands unto Heaven,</hi> was a Poſture uſed in the moſt Solemn Oaths, and accordingly it is deſcribed in <hi>Daniel,</hi> where theſe words follow, <hi>And Sware by him that Liveth For Ever.</hi> This Oath is the ſame with that in St. <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Revelations,</hi> and (as I have already ſhewn) taken by the <hi>ſame Perſon,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>It has been already ſhewn, who that Angel was, and as the Subſtance of the Oath which follows, is a Prophecy, ſo it was the Character of the High-Prieſt in Office to Prophecy; which is obſerved by St. <hi>John,</hi> upon the Advice that <hi>Caiphas</hi> gave the <hi>Jews, viz.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The ſame Introduction is to be found in the VIII Chapter, where <hi>Gabriel</hi> is ſent <hi>to make him underſtand the Viſion.</hi> Who,<note place="margin">Dan. VIII. 16.</note> upon that tells <hi>Daniel,</hi>

               <p>And to the ſame effect <hi>Daniel</hi> informs <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar;</hi> That <q>there is a God in Heaven that revealeth Secrets,<note place="margin">Dan. II. 28.</note> and maketh known to King <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> what ſhall be in the Latter Days.</q>

By comparing of all which Characters of the Time, as I did before of the Perſons repreſented in the Viſions, it is evident, that the II. VII. VIII. and XII. Chapters of <hi>Daniel</hi> relate to one and the ſame Subject, and are to be made uſe of to Explain and Illuſtrate one another; and if that is not ſufficient to give light to the Prophecy, we will find an entire ſatisfaction by obſerving where St. <hi>John</hi> treats of the ſame Period, both in the words of <hi>Daniel,</hi> when he ſays,<note place="margin">Rev. XII 14.</note> that <q>the Woman is Nouriſhed in the Wilderneſs for a Time, Times and half a Time</q> and in other Words, which mean the ſame thing, and in one place,<note place="margin">Verſ. 6.</note> relate to the ſame <q>Woman in the Wilderneſs that they ſhould feed her there a Thouſand Two Hundred and Three Score Days.</q> And upon another Occaſion relate to the Witneſſes, <q>who ſhall Prophecy during a Thouſand Two Hundred and Three Score Days,<note place="margin">Chap.

               </p>
               <p>The ſame Period is again mentioned under another Meaſure of the ſame Time, when it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Rev. XI. 2.</note> that <q>the Gentiles ſhall tread under the

                     <hi>That the Mouth ſpeaking</hi> great things, ſhall have Power given him to continue <hi>Forty and Two Months.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>It is very plain from all theſe Paſſages compared, that, <hi>Time, Times, and a half, One Thouſand Two Hundred and Sixty Days,</hi> and <hi>Forty Two Months,</hi> mean all the ſame thing, and conſequently, that the Word <hi>Time</hi> ſignifies a Year, <hi>Times,</hi> two Years, and <hi>half a Time,</hi> half a Year, ſince three Years and a half, conſiſting of Three Hundred and Sixty Days each, make juſt One Thouſand Two Hundred and Sixty Days, or Forty Two Months; and it is well known, that the moſt ancient Year among the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> was divided in their Kalendar into Twelve Months of juſt Thirty Days each, which makes juſt Three Hundred and Sixty Days.</p>
               <p>The only thing that has any Difficulty in theſe places which I have quoted, is, to know what is here meant by a <hi>Day.</hi> It will be very obvious by conſidering the many things that are to be done in the time of <hi>One Thouſand Two Hundred

               <p>The Expreſſion is very ſhort, but ſufficient to Remind <hi>Daniel,</hi> that it ſhould certainly come to paſs, as he had been informed already in the Viſion of the <hi>Four Beaſts,</hi> That <q>

               <p>They are part of the firſt Viſion which <hi>Daniel</hi> himſelf had Originally, as I obſerved before, which was in the firſt of <hi>Belshazzar,</hi> and this Viſion contains a general Abridgment of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of what was to happen from his own Time downwards, in a diſtinct Method, which he himſelf expreſſes thus, in ſhort,</p>

                  <note place="margin">Dan.

               </p>
               <p>Now that all theſe things may be conſidered in their proper place and order, there does not ſeem to be a more natural and eaſy Method, than firſt to go through <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Viſion

                  <q>And it is a rare thing that the King requireth,<note place="margin">11.</note> and there is none other that can ſhew it before the King, except the Gods whoſe dwelling is not with Fleſh.</q>
               </p>
               <p>By all this Diſcourſe it is plain that <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi> believed that theſe <hi>Wiſe Men,</hi> &amp;c. had a ſupernatural Art,. and if they had, he argued juſtly, that they could as well tell him the <hi>Dream,</hi> as the certain Interpretation or <hi>Accomplishment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But whether the <hi>Wiſe Men</hi> pretended to this ſupernatural Art till now that they were forced to own the contrary, or whether they were only Men of Learning, and it was the ſuperſtition of the People, and not their own Pretenſions, that made them paſs for <hi>Conjurors,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dan. I. 20. chap. II. 13,</note> as ſeems moſt probable, ſince <hi>Daniel &amp; his Fellows</hi> were reckon'd among them.</p>
               <p>However that was, They were, it ſeems, obliged upon this occaſion to undeceive <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar,</hi>
                  <pb n="43" facs="unknown:002509_0045_0FDB6665CDA729B8"/>and accordingly they gave him an Anſwer that diſown'd any ſupernatural Art in themſelves, and allowed that none but the Gods could Anſwer ſuch a Queſtion as the Kings, which Gods they did not pretend <hi>dwelt with Flesh,</hi> that is, inſpired them.</p>
               <p>It ſeems therefore, that all that they now pretended to, was to be skilled in that figurative Language, which had been uſually employed in true Prophetical Revelations, and ſo could without any inſpiration explain the importance of the Terms, and put the matter into Words commonly uſed and eaſily apprehended.</p>
               <p>In the ſame manner it ſeems to have been that the <hi>Magicians</hi> in <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Court imployed their Art and Skill to impoſe upon him, as far as Jugling Tricks would go. But where their Tricks failed them, they cryed out,<note place="margin">Exod. VIII. 19</note> 
                  <hi>This is the Finger of God.</hi> By which they gave up all Pretence to being themſelves Divinely Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Daniel</hi> when he was brought before the King, gave him a proof or a <hi>Sign,</hi> that what
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:002509_0046_0FDB6668189C4330"/>he was going to explain, would really come to paſs, ſince he told him what no Body could know but God and the King himſelf, when he was reminded of his Dream.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The King anſwered and ſaid to <hi>Daniel,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dan. II. 26,</note> whoſe name was <hi>Belteshazzar,</hi> Art thou able to make known unto me the Dream which I have ſeen, and the Interpretation thereof?</q>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But as for me,<note place="margin">30.</note> this Secret is not revealed
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:002509_0047_0FDB666B0D757EE0"/>to me for any Wiſdom that I have more than any living, but for their ſakes that ſhall make known the Interpretation to the King, and that thou mightſt know the thoughts of thy Heart.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Where <hi>Daniel</hi> gives two Reaſons why God has inſtructed him in the <hi>Kings Matter,</hi> one that he might be inclined to deal favourably with the <hi>Jews</hi> now in Captivity, and the other that he might be well aſſured that what he was warned of in a Dream, would certainly come to paſs, and was not a common Dream.</p>

And therefore what was <hi>already paſt,</hi> was not to make any part of the Dream. The <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Monarchy had been very Powerful, and the <hi>Babylonish</hi> Kingdom, (which was founded on the Ruins of it) had ſubſiſted ſome years before <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> but it was the Deſign of this Prophetical Dream, to deſcribe only what was <hi>Yet to come;</hi> and ſo the firſt Kingdom, meant by the <hi>Head of Gold,</hi> contained only <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> and his Followers to the Third Generation, as it is limited in <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s Prophecy,</p>
               <p>
                  <q>And now have I given all theſe Lands into the Hand of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi>

               <p>He was, undoubtedly, the greateſt Conqueror of his Time, and had Succeſs where-ever he made War, and ſo was a <hi>King of Kings,</hi> or a great Monarch; and the Spoils of every Nation

               <p>But the Expreſſion, <hi>Shall bear Rule over all the Earth,</hi> may well be thought to relate further to a Time when the <hi>Grecian</hi> Empire was to be ſet up again by <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> whoſe Dominion was much more Extenſive than <hi>Alexander</hi>'s. I ſhall in the Sequel of this Diſcourſe produce ſeveral probable Reaſons for this laſt Interpretation. But now I muſt go on in Order.</p>

                  <q>And whereas thou ſaweſt the Feet and Toes,<note place="margin">41.</note> part of Potters Clay, and part of Iron; The Kingdom ſhall be Divided, but there ſhall be in it of the Strength of the Iron, foraſmuch as thou ſaweſt the Iron mixed with Miry Clay.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>And as the Toes of the Feet were part of Iron and part of Clay,<note place="margin">42.</note> ſo the Kingdom ſhall be partly Strong and partly Broken.</q>

               </p>
               <p>The deſign of this is plainly to ſhew, that the diſtinguiſhing Characters of the ſeveral Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies ſhould Continue during the whole Period; and in this,<note place="margin">Rev.

               <p>The reaſon why the <hi>Fourth</hi> is not reckoned among them, is, becauſe the firſt three only advanced or aggrandized the Monarchy. But <hi>Xerxes,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Now when <hi>Xerxes pushed Weſtward</hi> he was ſmartly Repulſed, and forced to give it over after many Loſſes.</p>

The Reaſon why the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire is here deſcribed by a <hi>Dragon,</hi> ſeems to be, becauſe <hi>Trajan,</hi> the firſt Emperour, of whom St. <hi>John</hi> Propheſies, and who Reigned very ſoon after the <hi>Revelations</hi> were written, did after his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the <hi>Dacians,</hi> take their Standerd, which was a <hi>Dragon</hi> and made it a <hi>Roman</hi> Standard.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>John</hi> here, and in other places, follows <hi>Daniel</hi>'s manner of Deſcription, which repreſents in the Viſion a Figure, as exiſting at onc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Thus I have, I think, ſufficiently ſhewn what was the meaning in <hi>Daniel,</hi>

               <p>I ſhall now proceed to Explain, what is the <hi>Abomination of Deſolation,</hi> or <hi>Tranſgreſſion of Deſolation,</hi> meant in the XII. and VIII. Chapters of <hi>Daniel;</hi> and here we have the Aſſiſtance of the Interpretation given in the XI. Chapter, in which mention is made of <hi>Polluting</hi> the <hi>Sanctuary of Strength,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Who this <hi>He</hi> is, is deſcribed in a few Verſes after,</p>

               <p>This part of his Character ſhews <hi>He</hi> is the ſame Power that ſhould be <hi>in the Laſt End of the Indignation;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dan VIII. 19.</note>

                  <note place="margin">XI. 35.</note> 
                  <hi>for it is yet for a Time appointed:</hi> His <hi>Corrupting by Flatteries,</hi>

                  <note place="margin">VIII. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>through his Policy,</hi> and <hi>His Magnifying Himſelf above every God,</hi>

                  <note place="margin">VIII. 25.</note> And thus it is out of all queſtion, that the Perſon <hi>taking away the Daily,</hi> and <hi>ſetting up the Abomination,</hi> in the XI. Chapter is the ſame with the Perſon who is ſaid to do it in the VIII. And then it will follow, it muſt be ſtill the ſame mentioned in the XII. which is but a Continuation of the Viſion of the XI.

               <p>The Overturning the <hi>Heathen Roman Empire</hi> by <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> is the Period whence we reckon its End, and yet it had a Revival, in <hi>Julian,</hi> ſeveral years after, which laſted till, on <hi>Julian</hi>'s Death, it finally Periſhed.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Popes</hi> in <hi>England</hi> was taken away by <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. and thence we reckon its Fall, tho' it had a dangerous Revival in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Reign, but was quite Extirpated upon her Death.</p>
               <p>And in <hi>Germany,</hi> when the <hi>Reformation</hi> firſt began, and the <hi>Smalkaldick</hi> League was at its height, we reckon the <hi>Papal Power</hi> received its Deciſive Stroke among thoſe Princes and Cities who imbraced the <hi>Reformation;</hi> tho' afterwards <hi>Charles</hi> the V. had Impriſoned ſome, Deprived others, and well nigh Extinguiſhed the Party, till

               </p>
               <p>Juſt ſo We are to conſider the Fate of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> that it has received its Stunning Blow, when it loſt that <hi>Moſt Chriſtian King,</hi> as they might well call <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIV. whoſe chief Ambition was to Extirpate <hi>Hereſie,</hi> in which Attempt he ventured his Kingdom, at the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> who <hi>flattered</hi> him with a better Crown in <hi>Heaven,</hi> for his Service done to the <hi>Church on Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are yet to expect the Fall of the <hi>Court of Rome,</hi> by its being totally Deſerted and Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by the Princes who ſtill depend on it.
