            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHEN I heard the firſt News of the <hi>South-Sea</hi> Stock, riſing to ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable heigth, That a Perſon that had one <hi>Hundred</hi> Pounds caſt into that Stock, was raiſed to that paſs that he could Sell it out, at a <hi>Thouſand,</hi> and Eleven Hundred, <hi>per Cent.</hi> I could think no other, but the People concerned in this New Contrivance were a company of Mad-men; at leaſt they look'd like a company of Gameſters, eagerly gaming daily, leaſt their Chance ſhould be at an end; And when I heard of Men of low Degree, being advanced to their Coaches; What could I think but the World is turning upſide down; But all on a ſudden the Seal is turned; the next News is, That abundance are broke by the fail of Stocks, It's fallen from <hi>Eleven</hi> hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, under <hi>Three</hi> hundred; and none cares to buy; but all are for Selling, and where one hath Gained by this Evil Trade, many poor Families have been ruined, brought to Poverty, and turned beggars. The Trade of the City of <hi>London,</hi> one of the fineſt in the World, hath been very much ſhortned, few Ships have been built, or fitted to Sea, during the Reign of the <hi>South-Sea</hi> Company. O fine! Common Wealths Men.

ſure you have been the Heroes of year day. But into what a condition do you think have you brought your Country?

            <p>For Anſwer,</p>
            <p>In the Year 1690. the Colony of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay,</hi> Conſidering the hard War they laboured under, from both <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi>; Contrived an Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt <hi>Canada</hi>; and the Conduct of that Affair was Committed to Sir <hi>William Phipps,</hi> who doubtleſs was very hearty in that matter, and made an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack on the Town of <hi>Quebeck</hi> in the River of St. <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>; But by the Over-ruling Providence of GOD, Whether by the Seaſon of the Year, or the Storms that attended the Fleet, or Contrary Winds, or want of a ſufficient ſtore of Powder, or the delay of Attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Place; they were beat off, and their deſign fruſtrated. This was a very heavy Stroke upon this Country, and brought them low; partly by the loſs of their Veſſels, and partly by the great loſs of their Men; ſome whole Veſſels Companies were loſt, and ſome whole Companies of the Militia, never heard of. And thoſe that did come home, brought a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sickneſs with them; ſo that abundance died after the Fleets Arrival at home; And upon this the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try was greatly brought in Debt. This, we muſt all acknowledge, was a ſad and lamentable Condition we were brought into; and how to diſcharge the heavy Debt, lying on the Province; was a buſineſs lay much at heart, with thoſe that had the Government upon them at that day, the debates then had about it I am not now able to give you; but the reſult they then came to, was to Iſſue out a number of Colony Bills to diſcharge the Debts then fallen upon them, by the Expedition.</p>

            <p>Some Approved this Emiſſion as a good thing; others ſaid, They and their Children would Rue the day that ever they were Invented. However ſo it was, the Bills were made, the Sailors and Souldiers were paid off with them. Now for the conſequences;</p>
            <p>It put the Country into Confuſion as to their Trade. The Bills then made, did in ſome meaſure anſwer the End, becauſe they did diſcharge the Debt; but with what a great loſs, was it to thoſe Poor-Men, who ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured their Lives in the Expedition? They were forced to buy ſuch Goods as its likely they had hardly any need of, to get rid of their New-Coyn'd Money. And what they bought, was ſo to their diſadvantage, that

            <p>The other Conſequence was, that it was the firſt ſtep, or leading ſtroke, to all the Bills of Credit, that have been put out in this Province, and not only this Province, but the ſeveral Colonies, and Plantations, round about us; And if I am not miſinformed, One of the principal Iſlands in the Weſt Indies, took their meaſures, of making Bills of Credit, from a Gentleman brought up in <hi>New-England</hi>; who adviſed them of the great benefit, they were to this Country. But he thought only of the beginning, and not of the End; when he gave them that Advice.</p>

            </p>
            <p>As to the Progreſs made in the Quantity of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince Bills; it hath been ſomething large, I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs; but as to the growing, or thriving of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince thereby, I cannot as yet ſee through it. After the making the firſt Bills for the Canada Expedition, it being found, an eaſy way of paying of Debts, ſeveral more Expeditions were contrived, the Number, and Form, of them, is needleſs here to inſert; but we had found a way to pay for them, by ſtill Iſſuing out a farther Number of Paper Bills; So that whether they ſucceeded or not, we had found an eaſy way of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for them, and ſhuffling the Saddle off our own books, on to our Children; when the Debt was to be paid, it was but raiſing ſo many Thouſand Pounds to be paid in ſuch Years to come, and the matter was over, the Tax lay no heavier on the Subject, than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: But by the way, I would have it conſidered, that part of thoſe Taxes are yet to be raiſed on the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Generation.

               </gap> on that Affair, the General Court of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince ſaw good to Advance <hi>Forty Thouſand Pounds</hi> for the ſupply of the Fleet, for that Expedition, and to take their pay in Bills on the Government, in <hi>Great Britain.</hi> This was a conſiderable Addition to what Bills were out before, and all on a Fund for Years to come. All this while the Silver and Gold, that the Country had gotten by their good Husbandry before now, flew away, faſter than ever it came to us; and by reaſon of the Scarcity of Silver and Gold, for a <hi>Medium,</hi> the Government were perſwaded ſtill to go on in the old Road, of Iſſuing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of Paper Bills. The ſeveral Bills Emitted until this time were upon Impoſt and Exciſe, and a Tax upon Polls and Eſtates within this Province, which war a good Fund, ſo far, as it could conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently run. Then it being thought improper to ſtrain that matter too far, or ſtretch the ſtring till it broke; a new Method was contrived, the Sum of <hi>Fifty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds</hi> was made, to Let out to the Inhabitants of this Province, on their Real Eſtates; and they took it up upon Intereſt.

About this time the Silver being pretty well drained from the Country<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Bills Outſtanding on the former Fund, continually going in to the Treaſury, in Order to be Sunk; it was contrived to alter the Fund, and put off the payment for a longer time, by leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Tax about one half. This being not a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſtop, it was brought to about a quarter part, and I think continues thereabouts to this day, the other being put off for thoſe who come after, in reality. Altho' we are told, the Impoſt and Exciſe makes it up; yet it is plain, the firſt Fund was not upheld, if it had, the firſt Bills, I mean thoſe before the <hi>Fifty Thouſand Pounds,</hi> had been now (if not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether) yet almoſt at an end.

               </gap> I would deſire in this Caſe, to bring the ſtate of a Province, to a particular Man, and indeed, it is no other; Altho' we were told, at the time of the Altering the Fund, it was only a breach of promiſe made to our Selves. But I muſt ask their pardon, who ſay ſo, and I will begin with the firſt coming out of the Bills, and ſay, Had there not been Men of Subſtance in this Country, ſome that had Money, and ſome that had Goods; you might have made Paper Bills till you had been blind, they would never have fed your Bellies, nor have clothed your Backs. I pray, that would in Hundred Thouſand Pounds, in Paper-Bills have ſignified, to have been made, when the <hi>Indians</hi> Inhabited this Country; ſo that it's plain, they have a Credit from ſome Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that the People, amongſt when they are, Injoy. And now let me ſuppoſe, That a Man come to you, that Read this Paper, and deſire you to Lend him a Thouſand Pounds, or any ſmaller Sum, telling you he will give his Bond, to pay you in Twelve Months; and at the Years end, he comes and tells you, I can pay you but Five hundred, I will pay you the other the next Year. And at the next Years end, he comes

               </gap>l pay you the other hereafter: would you not think <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> is a ſtrange Man; would you not take the benefit of the Law upon him, or uſe ſome means or other to get your Money; or at leaſt, would not his Credit be fallen with you; would not a Merchant, a Shop-keeper, making the ſame compariſon, be of the ſame mind. Doubtleſs, if you ſpeak your Minds in this, you all agree. Well, the ſame it is in the caſe of Paper-Bills; the Man that hath an Eſtate, either Money, Goods, or Lands; ſo far as his Eſtate goes, he gives Credit to theſe Bills; the Country by an Act promiſes to take them again, at ſuch a time, but do not; Surely, this leſſens the Mans Credit of them: I will not, (ſaith he) Sell ſo much Silver, or Gold, or Goods, or Houſes, or Lands, for the Paper Bills, as I did before. And this may ſerve to ſhow that the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of the Fund, hath been prejudicial to the value of theſe Bills.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>Whether there be any One Inſtance in the whole World of Paper Bills being Serviceable to a Kingdom. State, or Province; were eſpecially to theſe Provinces in</hi> America?</p>
            <p>It is well known to all Perſons who are acquainted with the other parts of the World, either by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling, or Reading the Hiſtories of them, That ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts have made uſe of Paper Notes and Bills. And I do think on Emergent Occaſions, and in times of great ſtraits and difficulties, they may have been Serviceable, and in ſuch times only. So it was with us in our firſt Expedition to <hi>Canada.</hi> And could the door have been ſhut, that they had been paid off, and the Fund Complyed with, and no more Bills made; It might have been well. But the opening ſuch a door to the making more Bills, and continuing for near Thirty Years, in my Opinion, is ſuch a Damage, that I do think it would have been better the Country had given Twenty <hi>per Cent.</hi> for Money, than to have
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002291_0012_0fdb1bccdf4d8108"/>
let in the following Evils. But doubtleſs the Country might then have borrowed Money at Six <hi>per Cent.</hi> and their Security have been good. But if they wanted ſuch a Sum of Silver<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or Gold now, it would be more difficult for them to come at it. As great as ſome Men would have the Country to be. I underſtand the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Venice,</hi> have at ſome times<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> made uſe of Paper-Bills or Notes but could never learn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they made them their only <hi>Me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> come to our own Nation; there have been ſeveral Sorts of Notes uſed for the carrying on the Trade of that Great Nation. The Bank of <hi>England</hi> being the Chief that have uſed that practice, and held it with a ſteady Currency; it may be ſaid to be the moſt practicable, and beneficial of any I know of in the World. But then we muſt obſerve that they have always had the favour of the King, and Parliament to grant them ſuch A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s as ſupport them: which we can never expect to procure, at ſo great a diſtance And then further, That is carried on in ſuch a manner, that there is a conſiderable ſupply of Silver Money for the Exchange of thoſe Bills; and any Man deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to Exchange the Bills he poſſeſſes, going to the Office in Office hours, ſhall not have it ſaid to him Come again in the Afternoon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Now let a man make the Compariſon of a Single man, with the Country: Soppoſe a man of a conſiderable Eſtate, whoſe Credit would be taken for a large Sum, ſhould ſay. I will give out my Notes, or Bonds, to ſuch a Value, be it <hi>Ten Thouſand Pounds,</hi> more or leſs; would any number of men take them, and ſay. We will give you an Intereſt of Five <hi>per Cent.</hi> for them; No ſurely, they would ſay, What will you allow to us to take theſe Bonds, and Notes? But the Country are got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch a Caſe, that all men almoſt run Mad for theſe Bills; there not being enough of them to anſwer the Trade; nor never will if all the Paper in the Province were made into Bills; for the more is made, the leſs in my Opinion, they will produce; and its thought by many, that if the laſt <hi>Hundred Thouſand Pounds,</hi> which was upon the Anvil, had been hammered cut, thoſe Bills added to the former, would not have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed, near ſo much Silver-Money, Goods, or Lands, as theſe Bills now out, would have done without them.</p>

               </gap>ing to our Silver Money. When it was brought to go by Tale, evil-minded Men made a trade of clipping, rounding, filing, and debaſing the Money; and by that means, our Paper Bills in ſome meaſure loſt their Credit being equal but to that light Money then paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. Whereas, when they came firſt out, the Money was at <hi>Seventeen Penny</hi> weight. We may remember it was the ſame in the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> in the time of the late King <hi>William,</hi> as to the debaſing the Coyn; but that Wiſe Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nce made a thorough Alteration in that affair, by calling in all the Old Money; and new-coyning it. Truly, it look'd like a hard and difficult thing, inſomuch I have heard that the <hi>French</hi> King ſhould ſay upon it, If this doth not undoe him, nothing will. But this very thing proved the greateſt Service to the Nation of any thing done for many Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And I do think it a thing of great concern to any People to keep their Coyn at a ſteady price, and not to waver, and make alterations. But let us a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle conſider of the profit made by theſe Paper Bills. I will firſt begin with the Merchant, and ask what he hath got? I confeſs a <hi>Medium</hi> ſeems as neceſſary for him as any body: but without a <hi>good Medium,</hi> you had better have none at all, and come to Barter; which I acknowledge is difficult. But look a little into your Books, conſider what ſtock you began with; if you had <hi>One Thouſand Pounds</hi> Silver Money at <hi>Seventeen Penny Weight,</hi> at your firſt ſetting out; and have not no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Seveteen Hundred</hi> and <hi>Fifty</hi> in Paper Bills, or the value of them; you have gone behind hand; and its time to conſider whether theſe Bills have done you any Service? Indeed ſome Men have grown rich in the time of this Paper Money; and ſo it will always be, an alteration in Families, if there were no Medium at
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002291_0017_0fdb1bd81f452468"/>
all. But the caſe rightly ſtated is thus, Whether the Merchants in general have gained according to the above proportion? Nextly, Ile ask the Landlords of Houſes, that put out your Money at <hi>Seventeen Penny Weight.</hi> Whether you have got the Intereſt of your Monies, making the difference between Silver and Paper, as it now paſſes. Some, I am informed, built Houſes in the Town of Boſton, when Money was at <hi>Seventeen Penny Weight,</hi> that do not ſee above Four <hi>per Cent.</hi> Rents in Paper Bills. Conſidering your repairs, I do think you had as good even to have kept your Money in your Cheſt. I will next ask the Uſerers, What progreſs you have made, and whether or not the Money let by you at Six <hi>per Cent.</hi> hath not fallen in the value, near as much hitherto as the Intereſt came to? I will next ask the Gold, and Silver Smiths, What progreſs they have made, Whether working thoſe Mettals has not been leſſened in proportion to the growing Country ſince the new found Medium; or whether the Merchant hath not raiſed the price of Silver and Gold upon you? I will next ask the Men that live upon Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laries; as Miniſters, School-maſters; Whether you are better-ſupplyed by the Paper Bills, or whether it hath not forced you to ſeek for larger Salaries? I will next ask the Poor-labourer, that works for <hi>Five Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings per</hi> day, half Money, half Goods, Whether he lives better now than when he received <hi>Four Shillings</hi> a day in good Silver Money, at the rate of <hi>Seventeen Penny Weight</hi> for <hi>Six Shillings</hi>?</p>
            <p>But unto all this it will be anſwered, Silver Money is gone, and how ſhall we get it again? For anſwer, I do think the People ſeem to be ſo ſpirited in that matter, they will not have it till neceſſity forces it upon them; I do think of all the Plantations in His Majeſty's Dominions, none ſo capable of having Silver Money, as this Province, conſidering the great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Fiſh, and Oyl raiſed out of the Sea; the Fiſh all Selling for Money: and a great quantity of Ships
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002291_0018_0fdb1bdb781bf3e0"/>
built, which Trade to moſt parts of the World; and might do to many more; and the ability of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince to ſupply it ſelf with Victuals and Clothes. I do think none ſo able as this Province to be furniſhed with a Medium of Trade. But after all, if the Door be not ſhut againſt Paper-money, the Door will never be open for Silver-Money to come in Shut but the Door againſt Paper-Money, and if the Silver d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t come in in ſome meaſure, ſuitable to our wants; you ſhall ſay, I am a blind man, or a mad man, or what you pleaſe to call me. The Quantity of Bills out in this Government. I ſuppoſe is not above <hi>Two Hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds</hi> of all ſorts; and the Fiſh and Oyl caught every Year produces near that Money. Now how eaſy would it be to get a Medium, did not the Country in general ſet themſelves againſt it. For the finiſhing this head, I ſhall recommend to you the ſaying of a Great and Wiſe King, quoted in a late Pamphlet, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to a Medium of Trade, Printed in the Town of <hi>Boston,</hi> The ſaying was, <hi>That its better to</hi> run <hi>through the Fire, than to</hi> walk <hi>through it</hi>: And this I would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to our caſe as to Paper Bills; not to call them all in at once, but to call them in as they ſhall become due, according to the Fund they are our upon, and come to a certain Determination, that no more be Iſſued out; that ſo all People may know the End of it is coming; and not leave the Poor to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning men, to make a prey of them. For Example, in this great work, I would have conſulted the Noble preſident of the late King <hi>William,</hi> in altering the Coyn in <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and the great Service done the <hi>Iſland</hi> of <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> in putting a full ſtop to their Paper Bills. They have ſince had a competency or Silver Money; whereas had their Paper Bills gone on, they had been drained of their Silver, as we are</p>
            <p>As to the ſeveral ſorts of men before mentioned, at Merchants, Landlords, Uſerers, Goldſmiths, Salary Men, and Labourers by the Day, which exceed in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002291_0019_0fdb1bdd6f2fe520"/>
all the reſt: And add to theſe the Husbandmen, which exceed in number all other Trades and Callings whatſoever, in this Country. And I wonder the moſt of all at them who get their living out of the ground, that they ſhould be ſo diligent in Mortgaging their Lands to make a Medium for the Merchant to Trade on. And now one would think I ſhould have the greateſt part of theſe ſeveral denominations of man, joyn hand in hand in putting a Seal end to all Bills of Credit. But here lyes the bane of all, Theſe ſeveral ſorts of men are to be brought into two Parties; the man <hi>Free from Debt</hi> to his Neighbours; and the man In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in <hi>Debt,</hi> that he knows not how to get out. And here's the unhappineſs of all Societies of men, when ever they come together. There are many involved in Debt, their ingagements are ſo great, and ſelf love ſo powerful; its hard to foregoe dear Self; and here I am out-voted. Upon the whole, I doubt not but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Seven Years have paſſed over our heads, if we live to ſee that time, we ſhall ſee things of this nature, in another Form; for I think the Makers of Paper Bills, are almoſt out of breath, for want of a Fund to bring them out upon. There have been of late ſeveral things talk'd of in the late Pamphlets diſperſed about the Country. One great thing propoſed hath been the building a Bridge over <hi>Charles River,</hi> and that it would be a Service to us, to have Paper-Bills come out of the Treaſury for this work. This I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ook at to be next to building Caſtles in the Air. For if we cou'd ſink <hi>Forty</hi> or <hi>Fifty Thouſand Pounds</hi> in building ſuch a Bridge, the matter is uncertain, whether it would anſwer the end. For I can't learn of a faſt Bridge over ſuch a River, where there is ſuch a Stream, in the whole World; and if the project ſhould fail, where are your Paper-Bills then? But if the thing ſhould take, the Country would be but ſo much in Debt, and would not be ſupplyed with a Medium, if they ſhould build ſuch a Bridge every Year. They
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:002291_0020_0fdb1bdf21751810"/>
may, it's true, raiſe Bills of Credit, and put off the payment for many Years. But if they ſhould do ſo, they will hardly deſerve the Name of Bills of <hi>Credit</hi>; their Credit would run ſo low. Some talk of Fortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Eaſtern Country,</hi> and the <hi>Frontiers,</hi> ſo far as is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. As to that, I hope the Country will do what is neceſſary. But to do that to make a Medium, I think is wholly beſide our Intereſt. Upon the whole, I do think we have gone as far with Bills of Credit, as out Credit will bear; and it's time wholly to ſuppreſs them; and I do think Neceſſity calls for it.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. <hi>I ſhall conſider ſomething of the State of my poor Neighbours that have borrowed theſe Province Bills on their Eſtates; And what muſt be done for their Relief, under the difficult Circumſtances they are brought into</hi>?</p>
            <p>The condition of my poor Neighbours, I ſhall in ſome ſort deſcribe, by bringing the compariſon to a Single man, which I think the true way to deſcribe things of this nature. I will then ſuppoſe, That one of my Country-men is in want of Money, his Neighbour hath not more than for his own uſe; but the man in want comes to his Neighbour and ſaith to him, <hi>Neighbour. Your Credit is better than mine, give your Bond for me, and I will Mortgage my Houſe and Land to you, for your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Surety for me, and I will be Obliged to pay you Five</hi> per Cent. per Annum <hi>for your kindneſs in being Surety for me.</hi> The rich man, one would think, ſhould grow rich apace, and the poor man grow poor as faſt. But the rich and poor being Neighbours, and living one by the other, the rich man is forced to forgive his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour part of the Debt, or elſe they both fall in Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit together; altho' the rich hath a great advantage over the poor. And this I take in ſome ſort to be the ſtate of this Province, and thoſe who have borrowed Money from it. We will ſay there is but <hi>Two Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Thouſand Pounds</hi> in the Province, the Province hath <hi>One Hundred Thouſand Pounds</hi> in their own hands, and let
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:002291_0021_0fdb1be0b0d816e0"/>
it out at Five <hi>per Cent.</hi> to an hundred men, and this Money is let to men that have Real Eſtates; not men of Trade, but few; not great Landlords; they are generally wiſer than to take it; if they do. will ſoon return it; not to Uſerers, they have no need of it; not much to Merchants, becauſe the needy part of them have not Real Eſtates to Mortgage for it. But it is generally a poor man that hath a piece of Land, and wants to build a Houſe upon it; or a man that hath a Farm, and no Stock; or his Farm not big enough to maintain his Family; or beſides his Farm he wants to be fingering of Trade, or to keep a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, or ſuch like. But alas! the Money in turning once or twice, gets into the hand of the Merchant, Landlord, or Uſerer; and the poor man that firſt bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed it, hardly ever ſees it again; he can't get ſo much as will pay the Intereſt; what think yon will he do to get the Principal? The end is, his Houſe and Land goes to the Country. Well, what will the rich man do with his poor Neighbour, he can't make Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of him; his Houſe and Land will lye dead, unim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, it will pay no Taxes; Why the rich man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, I'le put my Neighbour into his Houſe again, and take no Intereſt of him, provided I can make good for my being Surety for him And the Country may depend upon it, That all the Money they will get from theſe Mortgaged Eſtates, will never be near ſo much as they delivered out, for both Intereſt and Principal. A few Years will fill the Court with Petitions on this ſubject, and ſomething muſt be done to eaſe them. I would not be thought to fault the Court in this affair; but the People who have brought this upon themſelves, and I do think ſomething muſt ſpeedily be done for their Relief. If a Committee were choſen by the Court to ſet the price of the produce of the Country ſomething higher than the Market price; or if it were confined only to Flax and Hemp; and the Treaſurer receive it of or in the behalf of the Committee who
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:002291_0022_0fdb1be4988701c8"/>
let the Bills, at a price ſet by a Committee choſen for that purpoſe, and ordered to ſet the price ſomething higher than the Market. Something of this nature muſt be done, that your Poor Neighbour may work out his Debt, and ſo the rich man take up his Bonds and burn them.</p>
            <p>VII. <hi>I ſhall conſider ſomething of the State of my Country, what it was before we had any Bills of Credit; and what it is at this day; And ſo ſhall wind up my thoughts on this Affair.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>New-England</hi> in its firſt Settlement, was ſetled by men of generous principles, and were accounted men of good Morals; but they had their difficulties in their ſettling theſe Colonies; A vaſt number of <hi>Indian</hi> Enemies to encounter with. But they were carried through thoſe difficulties in a great meaſure, before we fell into the Labyrinth of Bills of Credit. The Money they brought with them, and had acquired by their Care and Induſtry, was good. The <hi>New-England</hi> Shillings, and other pieces Coyned here, were as good Silver, if not better, than the Sterling-Money of <hi>Great Britain.</hi> And the Fiſhing Trade brought in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Quantities of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> pieces of Eight, and ſome other Coyns we had paſſing amongſt us; ſo that the condition we were in (conſidering the Infancy of the Country, and the many Enemies they had to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with) was as flouriſhing as could be expected. The People in that day were generally good Husbands, every man that could get a Houſe &amp; Land, it was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally his own, that is, It was not Mortgaged, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbred with Debts upon it. Although the Houſe was ſmaller than our Houſes now generally are; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>t the man choſe rather to live in it, than to Mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gage it, to make a fine Houſe. Altho' ſome had their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies then, as well as now; yet it was not ſo general; a man that had Mortgaged his Eſtate then, was look'd upon next door to a Bankrupt. Many now
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:002291_0023_0fdb1be5ab5ce038"/>
living can remember it ſo to be accounted. The Country when our Province Bills were made, I do ſuppoſe had not leſs than <hi>One Hundred Thouſand Pounds</hi> in Silver Money at <hi>Seventeen Penny</hi> Weight, for <hi>Six Shil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>s,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>nning Caſh, circulating in Trade; and at leaſt <hi>One Hundred Thouſand Pounds</hi> more, that did not circulate I do think I could name Five Families in the Country, that had <hi>Fifty Thouſand Pounds,</hi> which they made no uſe of in that day. And other People, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs had <hi>Fifty Thouſand</hi> more, which made up <hi>Two Hundred Thouſand Pounds.</hi> But ſince, its well drained out of their hands. The Trade was not ſo great in thoſe days as it hath been ſince. But what Trade they had, was carried on with much greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the Trader, than now it is. Every honeſt Labourer was honeſtly paid for his work, in general, without troubling his Neighbour in the Law for his pay; and theſe things conſidered, I think the Country was very happy at that day on Temporal accounts.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now conſider that the Country is at this day. Altho' we have a conſiderable number of men of generous Principles, and good Morals, following the Steps of their Fore-fathers; yet there is a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of men amongſt us of a ſelfiſh, contriving Spirit, who conſider more their own Intereſt, and their Friends, than the Publick good. As to the <hi>Indian</hi> War, which was ſo hard upon the Country formerly; I would hope it is pretty well come to an end, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the ſmall number of <hi>Indians</hi> left, that were in Hoſtility with us; and the increaſe of the Province in numbers of men; and the good Agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Great Britain</hi> and <hi>France</hi>; the <hi>French</hi> being the Supporters and Incouragers of the <hi>Indians,</hi> in a time of War: that I hope that matter is pretty near come to a ſtand This we owe to the good Hand of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence over us, and not to any means of our own.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:002291_0024_0fdb1be720448f20"/>And now I come to conſider the State of the Country at this day as to a <hi>Medium,</hi> and what the Conſequences of it are.</p>
            <p>I do ſuppoſe there may be near about <hi>Fifty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds</hi> of the old Province Bills yet outſtanding, the Fund being altered, and the time of payment put of for longer time; I mean thoſe Bills which were Emitted, before any Bills were made to lend to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular men upon Loan. Then there is one Loan of <hi>Fifty Thouſand Pounds,</hi> and another of <hi>One Hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds</hi>; all makes the Sum of <hi>Two Hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds.</hi> This is the only <hi>Medium</hi> this Province injoys. Indeed there are Bills of the Neighbouring Provinces paſſing amongſt us; but then we do ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they have as many, or more, of ours in the room of them. But one of our Neighbour Provinces is ſo wiſe, that I am told, they are going to ſhut up their Bank. I wiſh the reſt may be ſo wiſe as to follow them ſpeedily; that the Generation that led<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in this Error, may lead out of it; and not leave their Children in the dark. Now I would make ſome Compariſon of our State. Formerly we had <hi>Two Hundred Thouſand Pounds</hi> in good Caſh; now we have <hi>Two Hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds</hi> in Paper-Bills; and theſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ills have driven away our Caſh; and yet the cry is, <hi>We are richer than formerly.</hi> But it ſeems to me, we have ſpent the <hi>Two Hundred Thouſand Pounds</hi> of Caſh, and are become <hi>Two Hundred Thouſand Pounds</hi> in Debt. O ſay ſome men, <hi>We are in Debt to our Selves, and ſo no great matter.</hi> But I deſire to know, where is the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Well, What hath our Country for all this Silver Money and Plate?</p>
            <p>Why, we have as good Clothes as we can get, and thats even all, or the moſt part: Well, Wherein is our Country Richer, and more flouriſhing, than it was formerly? Why, Our great Riches lyes in great Houſes, Coſtly Furniture, and rich Cloathing, beyond men of our degree.</p>
            <p>Well, Is this all the great Riches you brag of? Why truly, we have nothing more than we had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly. The Land we had before, when we had our Silver-Money; but ſince the Peace, the Country doth increaſe; but in my judgment, it is vaſtly hindred for want of our <hi>Old Medium</hi>; and every mans thoughts are ſo taken up about the <hi>New Medium,</hi> That I am of Opinion that if the Country, Owed to a Foreign Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, a <hi>Hundred Thouſand Pounds</hi>; and could get the Paper Bills Intirely, ſtopt, the burden would be much leſs than the <hi>Medium</hi> we have now got. For as it is now, the Father is ſet againſt the Son; and the Son againſt the Father; Brother againſt Brother; Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour againſt Neighbour; a man can't ſpeak to his Neighbour againſt making Paper Bills, but he is ready to fly in his face!</p>

            <p>There was, not many Years ſince, a private Bank on foot in the Town of <hi>Boſton,</hi> it was thought it would have proved a greater damage than this Publick Bank; but I am of the mind if that had gone on, that this kind of <hi>Medium</hi> would have been at an end before this time: The Credit of that would ſoon have been ſpun out. Almoſt every mans cry is, <hi>Make more Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, Make enough</hi>! But every man that hath his eyes about him fees, that every time Paper-Bills are Emit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it raiſes all Commodities; That if it were poſſible to get out <hi>Five Hundred Thouſand Pounds,</hi> it would not fetch ſo much as <hi>Two Hundred Thouſand Pounds</hi> now doth. Now it ſeems to me, the further we go, the worſe it is. And for my own part, I would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to pay my part of the <hi>Hundred Thouſand Pounds</hi> to a Foreign Province, (as before mentioned) rather than to continue in theſe broils about a <hi>Medium</hi> of Exchange.</p>

               </gap>s true, we have reaſon to fear that; and who may we thank for it? But yet to continue longer, and go farther, will make it darker. But I don't think the day will be ſo dark, as ſome men make it. I obſerve the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men are turning good Husbands, and making their own Clothes. If <hi>Boston</hi> People would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to wear their Old Clothes over again, I am apt to think a few Years would bring us to rights.</p>
            <p>But ſome will ſay, <hi>It's hard going back; and the Poor will be much hurt.</hi> It's true, the Poor are to be pittied in this day, but I hope as Providence hath
