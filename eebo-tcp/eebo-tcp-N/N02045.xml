            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> It renders the Preaching of the Goſpel a meer Mock and Illuſion: For if many of theſe to whom it is preached be by an irrevocable Decree excluded from being at all priviledged by it, it wholly makes uſeleſs the Preaching of Faith and Repentance; and the whole Tenor of the Goſpel-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and Threatnings, Wreſtlings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Sin and Corruption, Faſting, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Humiliation, and all other pious

by the Perſon to whom the Tender is, unleſs a Grace be given him, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhall be, is an arrant Hypocrite, and a mercileſs Tyrant.

            <p>
               <hi>Eighthly,</hi> It makes the Publiſhers of the Goſpel to be meet mock Miniſters, not worthy of hearing, (ſeeing they cannot profit the Hearers) much leſs of feeding, and ſo richly rewarding; yea, ſuch as thereby make themſelves the moſt hateful Extortioners; and might be aſhamed to force Maintenance from Men, for running on ſuch a ſleeveleſs Errand as this is to all Men; for if this Doctrine be true, the Elect ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved without either their Preaching, or any Endeavours of their own<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But the

Reprobated ſhall never be benefited by either, and the Miniſtry is then fruit leſs; and the Prieſts Trade utterly vain: But yet, ſuch is the Force and Strength of Truth, that it compelleth them, to call ALL to come to Chriſt for Salvation; and to believe it every Man for himſelf, <hi>that Chriſt died for him,</hi> is tendred truly and ſincerely from God to him: And in particular, each is to believe him as his Lord and Saviour, or periſh: And that he is now freely profered, and as truly and unfeignedly offered from God to him, as he did once offer himſelf to God for him, as his Ranſom as well as for any: And that there is this good Ground for each particular Man to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it for himſelf, becauſe without Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of any Sinner in the World, that does not exclude himſelf, by his not coming, are freely without Reſpect of Perſons invited to come, and this Ground alſo, that as he is truly without Mockage, held out to ALL, and all bid to come, ſo God is willing they ſhould come, and have the Salvation; and to
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:002430_0025_0FDB429A7378C9D0"/>
that End hath ſent his Son not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn, but to ſave them; and his Son, his Miniſters to entreat them to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling as he is, and reconciled to him, as he is to them; and they declare for him according to God's Words in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>that he died for all and every Man; is a Propitiation for the Sins of the whole World</hi>; and <hi>died for the ungodly,</hi> and <hi>came to ſave them, and heal the Sick, and ſeek the Loſt,</hi> and ſuch like; and therefore every Man may conclude it's for him as well as any other, that can ſay he is a Man loſt, ſick, ſinful, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, and of the World; and that God hath alſo wrought in them, <hi>of his own good Pleaſure to will, and to do</hi>; and therefore now they muſt up and be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and work out their own Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which if it be not wrought out, God hath done his Part; and the Fault is only in their own particular Perſons; and God is no hard Maſter, but hath given to every one, one Talent at leaſt, which if he hides, he will be caſt into utter Darkneſs, and weep and gnaſh his

Teeth at the Remembrance of it, that once he might have been happy, had he not been wanting to himſelf, and been an unprofitable Servant with what he had; and had not (in his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) ſtill put the Salvation from him; and hated the Light and Inſtruction; And that God requires of Men but the Improvement of his own, and much more to this Purpoſe; which is all ſound, true, plain, wholeſome, ſaving Doctrine: And then to the ridiculizing, confounding and contradicting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, belying the holy Scriptures, and blaſpheming God, they come round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with a new Tale, whereby all the good Grounds, before laid for every Man that is called thereto, to come and believe upon, are utterly razed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved; and to tell them, tho' they are ALL called, and invited outwardly, yet the greateſt Part, a Hundred to one, are by a Decree in God's ſecret Council, ſo ſecluded by <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come, nor have any Right to Chriſt; he did not ſo much as die for them, but

It is abſurd to think, that God ſpake one Thing and intended another, therefore it was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for him to have done what God required of him, and he was not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated to that Obduration, until he hardened his own Heart, and then he was given up to a Reprobate Mind, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.28.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The following Scripture is falſly made Uſe of, <hi>viz.</hi> Iſa 27.11. <hi>He that made them, will not have Mercy on them, and he that formed them, will ſhew them no Favour.</hi> This Text has been met with in the Writings of ſome of thoſe that eſpouſe the aforeſaid Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, adduced to vindicate that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple

of Pre-ordination to Deſtruction: But it is therein groſly perverted; for in the ſame Verſe, the Cauſe thereof is fairly ſtated, and the Reaſon clearly ſhewn, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>.11. <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe they <hi>were withered Branches, and a People of no Underſtanding, therefore he that made them, would not have Mercy on them; and he that formed them, would ſhew them no Favour.</hi> So that it's clear they might have been fruitful, but would not, and had been green, but were wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd from their Greenneſs, much like thoſe whom Chriſt expoſtulates with, when he ſays, <hi>How often would I have gather'd you, as a Hen gathers her Chick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens under her Wings, but you would not,</hi> (Mat. 23.37. Luke 19.42.) <hi>O that thou had<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of the Blood of all Men, and their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction is of themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> They argue from the Words of the Apoſtle, <hi>Hath not the Potter Power over the Clay, to make of the ſame Lump one Veſſel to Honour, and another to Diſhonour</hi>? (Rom. 9.21.) Yes, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, he hath; but the Potter doth not make Veſſels deſignedly to break them to Pieces, or to deſtroy them, but for the Uſe and Service of his Houſe; and it is an Honour to be the meaneſt Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel in the Houſe of God, tho' ſome Veſſels are more honourable than others; and if the Veſſel mar in the Hand of the Potter, it is not the Fault of the Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but of the Clay, as we have it in the Inſtance of the Prophet, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Iſrael, Jer.</hi> 18.4. And the Lord in his Wiſdom, and to ſhew his Power, doth make Souls more or leſs honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as he pleaſeth; but 'tis plain, he makes none with Deſign to deſtroy them, both from Scripture and right Reaſon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="unknown:002430_0059_0FDB42E04A3119B0"/>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> They urge the Apoſtle's Words, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.18. but to as little Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe as the former, <hi>He will have Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on whom he will have Mercy, and whom he will be hardeneth.</hi> 'Tis true; God hath abandantly ſhewn us in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures on whom he will have Mercy, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>He hath Mercy on the Poor.</l>
               <l>The humble he teacheth of his Ways.</l>
               <l>Guides the Meek in Judgment.</l>
               <l>Cloaths the Meek with Salvation.</l>
               <l>Hath the Righteous in everlaſting Remembrance.</l>
               <l>Loves them which loves him.</l>
               <l>Saves them who loves his Son, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves in him; <hi>and</hi> gives to them ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life.</l>
            </q>
            <p>And Chriſt loves them, and manifeſts himſelf unto them; and wills not to harden any but the Wicked and ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſuch who ſlight their own Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and neglect their own Salvation;
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:002430_0060_0FDB42E1BB8B35B8"/>
and are malicious and uncharitable, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuring and unmerciful; but the <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful ſhall obtain Mercy,</hi> as ſaith Chriſt, in his moſt excellent Sermon which he preached upon the Mount, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.7. well worth the often reading and peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of all profeſſing the Name of Jeſus Chriſt. There was never any Sermon in all the World, preached by any Man ſince the Creation, like that of Chriſt's. And now, all who make a Profeſſion of the holy Name of Jeſus, are deſir'd and entreated to take a View of the Lives and Converſations of People, for with thoſe who walk moſt conſonant to the Doctrine of our bleſſed Saviour, they may moſt ſafely joyn in Communion and Fellowſhip, and in the Worſhip of the Father and the Son with them. But 'tis of dangerous Conſequence to join with thoſe that walk, and talk, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve contrary thereto.</p>
            <p>Thus it was in my Mind, and hath been for ſome Years, to ſhew to the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> People, the Weakneſs of ſome of their own Proofs, (as they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine

them) and ſtrongeſt Arguments for this corrupt Doctrine of theirs; and their Miſapplication of thoſe Texts of Scripture, which they advance, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their abſurd Notion of particular and perſonal Election and Reprobation of Souls to eternal Deſtruction and Damnation, before they were born, or having done either Good or Evil, that they might come to true Repentance, add lay hold on eternal Life, thro' Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt our Lord, and dwell in the Senſe of the univerſal Love of God and Chriſt to all Mankind; in the tender Bowels thereof, to all thoſe of the <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian, Independent or Baptiſt</hi> Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or any other who hold the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid groſs Error, are thoſe Lines writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; and in great Love and Tenderneſs, they are invited to ſearch the Scriptures, and ſee whether the whole Scope of them do not ſhew the contrary, and wonderfully and excellently ſet forth the Love and Goodneſs, Grace and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God and Chriſt to poor Mortals.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="unknown:002430_0062_0FDB42E627F3C0B0"/>Oh that People might lay hold of it, and come to Chriſt, that they might have Life; for tho' it is Good to ſearch the Scriptures, 'tis better to come to Chriſt. A Man may ſearch the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and not come to Chriſt as the <hi>Jews</hi> did, <hi>John</hi> 5.39.40. But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f a Man come rightly to Chriſt, he will not be negligent in ſearching the Scriptures, for they contain rich Treaſure to the ſeeking Soul. And <hi>they are able thro' Faith</hi> in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>to make the Man of God wiſe to Salvation,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.15. And what is therein clear to the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, <hi>That</hi> lay hold of, embrace, and put in Practice: But be careful not to meddle with what is obſcure to thy Underſtanding; for there is enough there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in which is plain and apt to moſt States and Conditions. And if thou wanteſt any Thing for thy Soul, which thou canſt not readily find Satisfaction about in the Scriptures; then I adviſe thee, in the Love of Chriſt, to ſeek to him, who is near every true ſeeking Soul. <hi>He is not far away from every one of you,</hi> ſaith

the Apoſtle, <hi>Acts,</hi> 17.27. He is in the true Believers <hi>the Hope of Glory,</hi> as ſaith the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, O tender Soul, come to Chriſt, pour out thy Soul to him, make thy Complaint to him; He being the <hi>Good Samaritan,</hi> the great Phyſician of Value, will in his own Time (if thou continue in well doing) help and heal thee.
