            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>Pride of understanding,</hi> which renders men <hi>self pleasing</hi> with pertinacy, Cuckow-like, <hi>qui s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A publick spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is a good Antidote against this poison, which will cause a man to rejoyce in the proceeding and prospering of any work, for the publick good in the hands of others, though themselves had no hand in it; as <hi>Luther</hi> said to <hi>Melancthon; si nos non erimus digni, fiat per alios.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Evil prejudice</hi>; There is a <hi>good prejudice,</hi> when a man from good principles hath a right judgment setled in his mind, whereby he is prepared to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern good from evil, and truth from errour, in what he readeth. In way of contra-distinction to this, I call its opposite <hi>evil prejudice,</hi> which ariseth from evil causes; I shall instance in two.</p>
            <p n="1">"1. Tradition, not warranted by Scripture. There was a common <hi>opinion</hi> among the <hi>Iews</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by such a <hi>Tradition,</hi> that the <hi>Messias</hi> at his first coming, would set up a glorious worldly Kingdom amongst them, like that of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> and that he would free them from their sujection to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and make them Rulers of the earth. This errour wrought ill effects, not only in the unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb facs="unknown:000143_0005_0FA2633E4C6994F0"/>
               <hi>Iews,</hi> whom it hindred from receiving Christ, when he was come in the flesh by their being offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at him, for his outward, mean, and afflicted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and death on the Cross; but also in his own Disciples, whom it hindred from understanding and believing whatsoever Christ spake of his suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and death. Yea, this errour was so deeply root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them, that after Christs Resurrection they asked him, <hi>Lord, wilt thou at this time again restore the Kingdom to Israel, Acts</hi> 1.6. Christs answer in <hi>ver.</hi> 7. shews, that they erred about the time, intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that this was not the season, but another time was appointed for that, <hi>viz. at Christs second coming for the salvation of all Israel.</hi> Yet concerning this his <hi>second coming,</hi> to set up his Kingdom on earth, some acknowledge no kingdom of Christ on earth, but spiritual and invisible in the hearts of the elect. The kingdom of Christ hath indeed been set up by his effectual operation of the spirit in the Ministry of the Gospel, from the first publishing of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, according to <hi>Psal.</hi> 24.7, 9. &amp; 110.2, 3. But there is another, a <hi>Political Kingdom of Christ</hi> to be set up <hi>in the last times,</hi> foretold by <hi>Dan.</hi> in Chap. 2.44, 45. &amp; 7.14, 18, 22. to 28. and by the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> unto the Virgin <hi>Mary, Luke</hi> 1.32, 33. and by the Apostle <hi>Iohn,</hi> in <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. and 20. chap. <hi>Yea, and all the Prophets from Samuel, and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days</hi>: As <hi>Peter</hi> saith, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.24. But about this also they, who of late were called <hi>fifth Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy-men,</hi> did err on the other hand, especially two ways. First, By anticipating the time, which will not be till the pouring out of the sixth and seventh Vials. Secondly, By putting themselves upon a
<pb facs="unknown:000143_0006_0FA2633EEB1EF4A8"/>
work which shall not be done by men, but by Christ himself, <hi>sitting upon his white horse, who will in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness judge, and make war, who hath eyes as a flame of fire, and a Name written that no man knew but himself, and will be cloathed with a Vesture dipt in bloud</hi> (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that Prophesie in <hi>Isa.</hi> 63.2.) <hi>and his Name is called the word of God. And the armies which were in heaven follow him upon white horses, cloathed in fine Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen white and clean,</hi> Rev. 19.11. to 15. &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <q>2. The second evil cause, from whence this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil prejudice ariseth, is from the abuse of these spiritual truths by carnally-minded persons.</q>
Such were those <hi>carnal Chiliasts</hi> or <hi>Millenaries,</hi> who dreamed of a worldly happiness consisting in carnal and sensual contentments to be injoyed in the 1000 years, Prophesied of in <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. The loathsome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their absurd errour, wrought such a loathing of their opinion in sundry godly Learned Writers, that they declined the literal exposition of <hi>the first Resurrection, Rev.</hi> 20 12. Which will be <hi>of the just</hi> (as it is called in <hi>Luke</hi> 14.14.) in the beginning of the <hi>thousand years,</hi> when Christ will judge Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ and other living enemies of his Church, and after the end thereof will be the general Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the general judgment, as is noted and proved by that Learned man Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> (who was no <hi>phana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi> as the <hi>Prelates</hi> themselves will grant) out of <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. and other places of Scripture. This king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Christ must be placed (as he saith) between Christs appearing in his kingdom, and the last Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of all the world unto the general judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. (I suppose he meaneth according to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24, 25. and so includes the finishing of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral judgment in the end of the world within the
<pb facs="unknown:000143_0006_0FA2633EEB1EF4A8"/>
time of Christs kingdom.) And that this is that kingdom of Christ whereof <hi>Daniel</hi> prophesied in <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.13, 14. &amp; 18, 22, 26, 27. and the Apostle <hi>Iohn, Rev.</hi> 20. he proveth by two Arguments, and concludes, that they go about to take away the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of Evangelical faith, concerning the glorious coming of Christ, who neglecting the Ancient Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Church, endeavour to transfer the prophesie in <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. elsewhither. Yet some expound <hi>the first Resurrection</hi> in a spiritual sense (declining the Literal) and understand it of the elects effectual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the truth; but this hath been done in all Ages, since the first publishing of the Gospel gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.18. and therefore is not the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that prophesie. And Dr. <hi>Thomas Goodwin</hi> proveth the <hi>bodily Resurrection</hi> of the Martyrs from <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.5, 6, 7. by clear and good Textual Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in his Sermons on <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.21, 22. p. 32. and on <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.9, 10. p. 18. to the end. They also note that the thousand years wherein Satan was bound, begins in the year 300. after Christ, when the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions of Christians by the Heathen Emperours ceased: But this agreeth not with the binding of Satan in the bottomless pit during that thousand years; for it is manifest, that since that time Satan hath by his instruments seduced and persecuted the Saints as much, at least, as at any time before: How then can it be said, that he was then bound for 1000 years? <hi>Alstediu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The increase of the Church, and the Conversion of <hi>Israel,</hi> and the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> 3. The freedom of the Church from the persecutions of enemies. 4.

<q>such a perfection of light, and holiness, and love, as is attainable on this side of heaven.</q>
To conclude, when true principles are held forth in the Letter of any Text, and some draw false inferences from thence, let the mis-collections of vain men be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed, and the truth be declared, and the declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof <hi>be accepted of all the Saints:</hi> How often doth the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> complain of mens abusing his holy Doctrins? Did he therefore avoid the holding forth of such truths? No, he confirmed those truths, and refuted the contrary errours with detestation. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.3. to 9. &amp; 5.20, 21. with 6.1, 2, &amp; 9.19, 20. And even that Doctrine which borders up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Subject of <hi>the following Treatise</hi> delivered by him for the comfort of the Saints in, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5.14. to 18. was abused by some whom he refuted in 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.1. to 13. And <hi>the Apostle Peter professeth his consent</hi> with the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> and he addeth a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of the <hi>new heavens, and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness,</hi> and this saith he, <hi>we look for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his promise</hi> (that promise is in <hi>Isa.</hi> 65.17. &amp; 66.22.) which shall be here before the general judgment, and the end of the world, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.7. to 16. This time <hi>Paul</hi> calls, <hi>the time of the manifestation

of the Sons of God, for which</hi> he saith, <hi>the earnest ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the creature waiteth, in hope that then it shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption, into the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious liberty of the Children of God, Rom.</hi> 8.19. to 23. This state of things on earth, is called <hi>the world to come</hi> in <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.5. Dr. <hi>Tho.

He conceives the time to be near, and gives good grounds for such a conception, and two signs thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> the sleepiness of wise and foolish Virgins, which imports the Bridegroom is near and coming, and the present shakings of Nations, which are fore-runners of deliverance. God shakes foundations and pillars of States when he is about doing great things for his people, <hi>Joel 3.16. Jer. 50.46.</hi> Unto these may be added, First, The strong workings of mens spirits at this day; for not only Protestants, but Papists, Iews, Turks, Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, and other Idolaters do expect some great Revolution of Affairs, as Travellers that have been amongst them do relate. Secondly, The wickedness of Potentates indulging their lusts, abusing their power, ruling by their own will, persecuting those are good, and interposing unduly in the things of God, and oppressing the poor. Thirdly, The great distractions and confusions which are at this time in the Governments, Counsels, and Transactions of worldly Rulers, States, and Kingdoms, their Foundations are out of course, and they know not what to do. These and many others do raise the Faith and expectation of observing men, that the Lord will shortly appear, and do some wonderful things for his people.

            </p>
            <p>Now the question is, what this mystery may be which must be finished after the sounding of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Trumpet, which is the concluding Trumpet,
<pb facs="unknown:000143_0012_0FA263436AB39078"/>
after which none shall sound, till the <note n="(v)" place="margin">1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4.16.</note> Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the Arch-angel, and with the Trumpet of God, which is called <hi>the</hi>

            <p n="1">1. There is a mystery to be finished at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of the dead saith the Apostle, <note n="(x)" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.51.</note>

            <p n="3">3. This mystery then must be that of the calling and in-coming of the <hi>Iews,</hi> with the fulness of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> for I find no other mystery. And this is called <note n="(b)" place="margin">

the seventh Trumpet,</hi> answereth the scope of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel who spake of it to <hi>Iohn.</hi> For the appearing of the Angel in that form, and the little book in his hand, and his taking that solemn Oath, are all conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory to the Church greatly suffering under Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ during the sounding of the sixth Trumpet; and what can be more comfortable, than to hear that these sufferings of the Church are not long to continue, but the calling of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and coming in of the fulness of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the spreading of the everlasting Gospel, and enlarging the kingdom of Christ (so much narrowed by the power of Turk and Pope under the sixth Trumpet) and the final confusion both of Turk, and <hi>man of sin,</hi> are drawing on, and to be accomplished under the seventh Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet?

<pb facs="unknown:000143_0013_0FA263948FF04E98"/>
way prepared? By removing all impediments out of the way of their conversion. And what these im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments are, we shall the better understand, by considering, 1. Whither the <hi>Iews</hi> shall then go. 2. What to do. Whither shall they go? <hi>viz.</hi> West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to joyn with the Churches of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in the beginning of the sixth vial, as hearing of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of <hi>Rome,</hi> under the fifth. For then will their eyes begin to be opened to see Christ to be the true <hi>Messiah,</hi> when they shall see the most eminent judgment of God in the ruine of the seat of the Beast. After which the beast will survive for a time till the close of the sixth vial; during which inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, the <hi>Iews</hi> will be stirred up to joyn with the Christian <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to effect the final ruine of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>Babylon.</hi> To this end, their way must be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared; How? By the drying up of the waters of the great River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> i. e. By diminishing and weakning the power of the Turk, who lyeth as the great impediment in this their way. For the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this great River, signifie the great power of the Turk, and the vast multitudes of people under his Dominion; for thus, the numerous host of the King of <hi>Assyria</hi> is called, <note n="(k)" place="margin">

               <hi>the waters of the river,</hi> (viz. <hi>Euphrates) strong and many.</hi> And like as when the sixth Trumpet sounded, the four angels which were bound in the great River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> were loosed, and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Army of the horsemen was <hi>two hundred thousand thousand,</hi> i. e. the power of the Turk was exceeding great: Even so, when the sixth vial (which answereth to the sixth Trumpet) is poured out, we have the contrary effect wrought, <hi>viz.</hi> the
<pb facs="unknown:000143_0014_0FA2639542FD03C0"/>
drying up of the waters of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> i. e. the great abatement of the Turkish power. God now remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth this hindrance out of the way of the <hi>Kings of the East,</hi> who at present have two great impediments obstruct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ng their conversion. 1. The Idolatry of <hi>Rome.</hi> 2. The power and prosperity of the Turk, the potent and professed enemy of Christianity. And though the first of these shall be removed in the ruine of <hi>Rome</hi> by the pouring out of the fifth vial upon the seat of the Beast, yet the second impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment lyeth still in the way, till by the sixth vial the waters of the great River are made foordable; and dreined so low, that the <hi>Iews</hi> may be able to wade thorow them to joyn with the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to the utter overthrow both of Turk and Pope. How the power of the Turk shall be thus lessened, whether by inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine commotions, or by wars from abroad, or by the prevailing of the Gospel in his Dominions upon the fall of <hi>Rome,</hi> I know not; but it is certain, that the waters of <hi>Euphrates</hi> shall be dryed up, and the way of the <hi>Kengs of the East prepared</hi>; besides which, they must be dryed up also to make way for the <hi>Iews</hi> to repossess their own Land. <note n="(l)" place="margin">

            <p n="4">4ly, There is something yet further in the Book of the Revelations pointing to the conversion of the <hi>Iews.</hi> For it is remarkable, that the <hi>Apocalips</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Hebrew</hi> three several times, though only in three words, but still in passages very applicable to the <hi>Iews.</hi> 1.

every word is a mystery</hi>; certainly some words there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are so more eminently, and among others these two, <hi>Abaddon</hi> and <hi>Apollyon</hi>; both signifying, <hi>one that is a destroyer,</hi> viz. of men, such as is Antichrist; And his name is here expressed both in <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek.</hi> 1.

<pb facs="unknown:000143_0020_0FA2639E23D80A68"/>
why learned and judicious men have looked upon the notion of the <hi>Chiliad,</hi> as Heretical, is, because some that were for that opinion, maintained that the Saints after their resurrection should again live a sensual life, in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of carnal pleasures.

            <p>The truth is, I was exceeding backward to entertain
<pb facs="unknown:000143_0021_0FA263A02F366148"/>
such a notion, and did long oppose it, as conceiving it might be at best an innocent errour of some that wished well to the kingdom of Christ: But blessed be the Lord God who gave me an heart at that very time to search (according to my poor measure) the Scriptures and other Books which might be helpful in this case, both such as argued for, and such as argued against the <hi>Chiliad;</hi> and to look up to him that is in heaven and heareth on earth, that I might see and embrace the truth, and only the truth. And methinks, I would desire no more, if I could but perswade all <hi>serious and gracious</hi> men to go that way to work in this matter. But (alas) it is the great infirmity of many good men, that if any thing (though of never so circumstantial a nature, for as for fundamentals, let no one dare to question there) be voiced for an errour they fall upon it in great zeal without ever looking up to heaven, that if what they oppose be truth, they might be convinced of it, as well as if it be otherwise that they might be strengthned in bearing witness against errour, and hence the Lord never lets them see their mistakes. But as a learned and worthy Divine, <note n="(i)" place="margin">

            <p>All this notwithstanding, I am not of their judgment who usually pass under the notion of <hi>Millenaries.</hi> For I do not think that there are any more than two personal comings or Residencies of Christ upon the earth, spoken of in

            <p>But I would not detain the Reader too long in the porch. Only remember, that this <hi>Discourse</hi> is the substance of several <hi>Lecture-Sermons</hi> preached in the ordinary course of my Ministry to a plain Auditory, and therefore not Elegancy of phrases, or <hi>wisdom of words</hi> (I thank Christ I have learned to slight such vanities in the sacred and awful things of God.) But (as far as the nature of the suctject will permit) Truths plainly delivered, are to be expected; and that (in some poor measure) I trust the Reader will find.</p>
            <p>However, it is a satisfying thought unto me, when I consider, that, as it is true, if what is here asserted be found stubble when the day of fire cometh, I shall have no reward for all my pains, studies, and poor indeavours in seeking to understand, and to evince these things unto others; so on the other hand, if what I have affirmed or propounded, (for in some things which are more disputable, <hi>nihil affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo, sed propono) be built upon the golden founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
               <pb facs="unknown:000143_0023_0FA263A1223EDC68"/>
then in <hi>that day</hi> (which the Lord hasten) when every man shall receive according to his works, it will not repent me of what I have publickly taught or written, nor will they that have dis-believed and opposed these Truths, then at all rejoyce in what they have in that respect done.</p>
            <p>Now the Lord fit us for what ever the birth may be which his divine and holy providence is travelling with at this day. Surely there is some great thing upon the wheel, and it seemeth as if it might be said, <hi>the captive exile hastneth;</hi> Do not the signs of the times begin to shew their faces very apparently? Do not the waves of the Nations begin to stir? Do not the flouds lift up their voice? <hi>The Lord hath been opening his armoury, and bringing forth the weapons of his Indignation; a sound of Battel is in the Land, and of great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction. Behold, they whose judgments it was not to drink of the Cup, have assuredly drunken, and art thou he</hi> (O Roman Antichrist, thou with thy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders and followers!) <hi>that shalt altogether go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punished? thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink of it. The Lord, the Lord of Hosts shall lop the bow with terrour, and the high ones of stature shall be hewen down, and the haughty shall be humbled. The Stars of Heaven, and the Constellations thereof shall not give their light.</hi> And although it may be, we may die in the storm, yet the Generations to come are like to see <hi>dayes of glory.</hi> Let us then give him, <hi>that turneth the shaddow of death into the Morning, no rest, till he make</hi> Ierusalem <hi>a praise in the Earth: For</hi> Sions <hi>sake, and for</hi> Ierusalems <hi>sake, let us not hold on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The ten Tribes are often called <hi>Samaria,</hi> the deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination being from the <hi>Metropolis, Isa.</hi> 7.9.

            <p>Q. 3. <hi>What is meant by being saved? Answ.</hi> In this salvation there is, 1. The term from which; 2. The term to which it shall be. 1. The term from which, <hi>viz.</hi> from a state of bondage and misery. And this is double, either, 1. <hi>Temporal</hi>; oftentimes in the Scripture, salvation is put for deliverance from temporal bondages and miseries, <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.27. And this is part of the Apostles meaning here; for all <hi>Israel</hi> hath been in temporal outward bondage and misery this long time.

<q>This salvatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> implyeth deliverance from spiritual <hi>bondage and misery.</hi>
               </q>
Hence in the Text it is expressed by turning away ungodliness. And salvation is very often used in the Scripture in that sence, <hi>viz.</hi> for deliverance from spiritual bondages, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.24. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.71, 74, 77. And therefore when the Apostle saith, That <hi>all Israel shall be saved,</hi> this also is part of his meaning; That the whole nation of the <hi>Iews</hi> shall be <hi>saved</hi> from the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their minds, <hi>saved</hi> from the hardness of their hearts, <hi>saved</hi> from the unbelief of their souls, <hi>saved</hi> from that curse and wrath of God which lyeth upon them, and which hath remained upon many of them, for more than 2000 and divers hundreds of years.</p>
            <p n="2">2.
<q>There is the term unto which this salvation shall be, <hi>viz.</hi> unto a glorious state of happiness.</q>
And this is, 1. <hi>Temporal.</hi> The <hi>Iews</hi> who have been trampled upon by all Nations, shall shortly become the most glorious Nation in the whole world, and all other Nations shall have them in great esteem and honour, <hi>Isa.</hi> 60.1, 3. <hi>Arise, shine, for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. The Gentiles shall come to thy light, and Kings to the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of thy rising.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2.
<q>This salvation implyeth spiritual and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal happiness.</q>
Usually, salvation in the Scripture is taken in that sence, for the communication of spiritual and eternal good unto the soul, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8, 9. Salvation implyeth grace for the soul, and glory for the soul. And this is the main thing here intended. All <hi>Israel</hi> shall be saved,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:000143_0031_0FA263A740282D28"/>
               <hi>i. e.</hi> they shall be converted unto God, they shall be made partakers of much grace here, and of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal glory hereafter. The salvation of the world to come is comprehended under this saying, <hi>All Israel shall be saved.</hi> For the words may well have reference unto a speech that the <note n="(n)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Alludit ad dictum Hebrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orum,</hi> omnem Israelitam ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biturum partem in futuro sae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culo. <hi>Grotius, Hoc dictum vide in Tract. Synod. c.</hi> 10. <hi>Lege Capelli obser. in N.T. p.</hi> 120.</note> 
               <hi>Hebrews</hi> made frequent use of; <hi>sc. That every</hi> Israelite <hi>shall have a part in the world to come.</hi> Therefore everlasting life, which shall be vouchsafed in the world to come, <hi>Mark.</hi> 10.30. is here intended.</p>
            <p>Having thus (by the help of Christ) cleared the ground-work and foundation, the Doctrine to be raised thereupon is plainly this.</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>That the time will surely come, when the body of the twelve Tribes of</hi> Israel <hi>shall be brought out of their present condition of bondage and misery, into a glorious and wonderful state of salvation, not only spiritual but temporal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in the Doctrinal handling of this Truth, four things may be attended; 1. To shew that the twelve Tribes shall be saved. 2. When this salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to be expected. 3. Why all <hi>Israel</hi> shall be saved. 4. What kind of salvation it is, which all <hi>Israel</hi> shall in the appointed time partake of.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We are to shew, that the twelve Tribes shall be saved. And this is evident, if we consider, 1. That the two Tribes or <hi>Iews,</hi> 2. That the ten Tribes or <hi>Israelites</hi> (so distinguished in the dayes of old) shall be saved.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The two Tribes or <hi>Iews</hi> shall be saved. We
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:000143_0031_0FA263A740282D28"/>
shall not here insist upon such arguments as some have stood upon. <hi>Austin</hi> layeth weight upon a typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal argument, <hi>sc.</hi> That as the <hi>Gileadites</hi> rejected <hi>Iephtha,</hi> but afterwards they returned to him again; so the <hi>Iews</hi> should reject Christ, but afterwards they should embrace him. And others <note n="(o)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Sic Willet, Beza, Fagus,</hi> &amp;c.</note> there are who lay much weight up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an argument drawn from the secret wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful providence of God in preserving the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation entire from mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures with other Nations where they are dispersed. The providence of God hath suffered <note n="(p)" place="margin">

               </note> other Nations to have their bloud mixed very much: As you know it is with our own Nation, there is a mixture of <hi>British, Roman, Saxon, Danish, Norman</hi> bloud; but as for the body of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation, it is far otherwise. Let an <hi>English</hi> family live in <hi>Spain</hi> five or six hundred years successively, and they will become <hi>Spaniards</hi>; but though a <hi>Iewish</hi> family live in <hi>Spain</hi> a thousand years, they do not degenerate into <hi>Spaniards,</hi> (for the most part.) It is true, that a Genealogical distinction amongst the <hi>Iews</hi> is now perished, because the <hi>Messias</hi> being come, there is not now (though before that there was) any need of such distinction, yet a National distinction there still remaineth; whence some conclude, that there will be in due time a National conversion of that people. But albeit, this argument is not to be slighted; yet I chuse rather to build upon plain Scripture-proof. Consider then, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.6, 10, 11. And <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. two last <hi>verses.</hi> Where it is clearly
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:000143_0032_0FA263A7DBF9E168"/>
intimated, that a day shall come when the desolated <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation shall account him blessed that cometh in the name of the Lord. And <hi>Luke</hi> 2.32.

<q>But how is it proved, that the ten Tribes or <hi>Israelites,</hi> shall be saved as well as the two Tribes or <hi>Iews</hi>?</q>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Because we read often in the Scripture concerning <hi>Israels</hi> salvation, as well as concerning <hi>Iudahs</hi> salvation. Now though <hi>Israel</hi> in the New Testament doth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times note the two Tribes or <hi>Iews</hi> (as hath been said) yet, in the old Testament, <hi>Israel</hi> usually signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the ten Tribes, and not the <hi>Iews</hi> strictly so call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.

unto <hi>Iudah,</hi> the one noteth the ten Tribes, as the other the two Tribes. But we read often of the salvation of <hi>Israel,</hi> as in contradistinction unto <hi>Iudah.</hi> See <hi>Ier.</hi> 30.3. &amp; 33.7, 14, 24, 26. Moreover, the ten Tribes are usually signified by the names of <hi>Samaria, Gilead, Achor, Carmel, Ephraim, Ioseph,</hi> &amp;c. Now the Scripture speaketh of a restauration to be vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed unto <hi>Samaria, Gilead, Achor, Carmel, Ephraim, Ioseph.</hi> See <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.5, 6, 18, 20. <hi>Zech.</hi> 10.6, 7, 9, 10. <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.14. <hi>Obad.</hi> 19. <hi>Ier.</hi> 50.17, 19.</p>
            <p n="2">2.
<q>It is evident, that the ten Tribes shall be saved as well as the two Tribes, because there is a promise of the re-union of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Iudah,</hi> and that they shall become one entire <hi>body.</hi>

As the Priests could not enter into <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple, (1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.10, 11. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.8.) until the seven days dedication was over, so the <hi>Priestly Nation of</hi> Israel cannot enter into the Temple till the seven vials be poured forth.

considering that oftentimes in the New Testament it is said, that this and the other thing came to pass, that so there might be a literal fulfilling of such Scriptures, which yet had a mystical interpretation, as in <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.5. the <hi>Earth-quake</hi> there spoken of, is to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted mystically of a great shaking brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> in answer unto the prayers of the <hi>persecuted and martyred</hi> Saints; yet there was also at the same time a <note n="(q)" place="margin">

            <p>But 2. <hi>By</hi> Euphrates <hi>may be meant the Turkish Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire</hi>: There are <note n="(u)" place="margin">Confer <hi>Brightmam &amp; Medum in loc.</hi>
               </note> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially two reasons which do constrain me to close with that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation (not excluding the former.) One is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I find that in another place in the <hi>Book</hi> of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> the <hi>Turkish power</hi> is signified by <hi>Euphrates,</hi> Rev. 9.13, 14. <hi>I heard a voice saying, loose the four Angels which are bound in the great River</hi> Euphrates. The meaning of the place may be, That the Turks which lay on both sides the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and were divided into four <hi>Sultanies</hi> or Kingdoms should be let loose, partly by composing their civil dissentions, and partly by being united under one <hi>Ottomanical head,</hi> to make a dreadful irruption upon the <hi>Roman Empire.</hi> Again, <hi>Euphrates</hi> is used in the Old Testament, as being significative of the <hi>Assyrian Empire,</hi> Isa. 8.7. <hi>The Lord bringeth upon them the waters of the River,</hi> 
               <note n="(w)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Vide Targum.</hi>
               </note> i. e. <hi>Euphrates,</hi> which, by way of eminency, is called <hi>the River.</hi> See 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.21. <hi>Psal.</hi> 72.8. &amp; 80.11. <hi>even the King of Assyria</hi>: So that you see the King of <hi>Assyria</hi> is expressed by <hi>Euphrates.</hi> Therefore the Turk being the <hi>Assyrian</hi> of the world at this day,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:000143_0042_0FA263B82E3A7CE8"/>
may well be expressed by the same term.
<q>So then the sum of all is, that when it is said that <hi>Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> must be dryed up, that the way of the Kings of the East may be prepare: It noteth, that divine providence will by some means or other, bring a fatal destruction upon the Turkish Empire, in order to making the way clear for <hi>Israels</hi> salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</q>
In a word, (and so I pass off from this proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;) <hi>Rome</hi> shall be destroyed before the conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Iews</hi>: and as for the Pope and Turk, they shall be utterly destroyed after the <hi>Iews</hi> conversion, yet before or together with the consummate salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Tribes of <hi>Israel.</hi> The utter destruction of all Antichristian power is in order of nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but in time it doth synchronize with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summate salvat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <q>2. That large measure of the spirit of grace which God hath given to some of his people, is a comfortable ground of hope that <hi>Israels</hi> salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not far off:</q>
As when salvation is near to come, men ought to be very holy, <hi>Isa.</hi> 56.1. So the Saints of God are wont to be so. When the Lord intends to bestow eminent mercy upon his people, he useth to prepare them for it, by pouring abundantly of his Spirit upon them, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.17. Now the conversion of the <hi>Iews</hi> will be an eminent mercy unto <hi>Gentile</hi> Churches, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.15. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore before that day, the Lord will refine his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And hath he not done so? why have the Churches of Christ been put into the furnace of late? Surely it is that they might come forth, as gold cometh out of the fire. Great tribulation is upon the Saints in other places of the world, that so they might come forth with their garments washed in the bloud of the Lamb. And doubtless, as the Lord God is hardning the wicked for the day of destruction; so he is sanctifying his people, and fitting them for a day of great salvation, by the present judgments, persecutions, and general calamities which are come, and coming upon the world.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <q>3. The wickedness of the wicked, is grown to a monstrous height, and that is a sign it will not be long before the deliverer come unto <hi>Sion.</hi>

When righteous men are more and more righteous, and when wicked men are more and more wicked, 'tis a sign that the Lord is coming to finish the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, in creating the new world wherein the righteous should dwell, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.11, 12. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.13, 14, 15, wherefore if we would know whether this <hi>salvation of Israel</hi> be near or no, then we must

Have not some Lands received (if not the mark) the number of the beasts name, which once had almost wholly cast him off? Doth not Popery spread it self a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and prevail exceedingly? However to be sure, there was a time when all the world wondred after the beast. And sin hath filled up that dimensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of its length when it hath been of long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. And hath not the iniquity of Antichrist been so? It might be proved, that the Blasphemy (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Idolatry) <hi>Isa.</hi> 65.7.) of Antichrist hath conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued above 1200 years. Again, sin hath filled up that dimension of its height when it is grown inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent against heaven, when there is sinning with an high hand, when hideous blasphemies are spoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the God of heaven. Thus must it be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before the calling of the <hi>Iews, Rev.</hi> 16.11, 12. And is it not so at this day? How do the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed blaspheme God? Do they not blaspheme prayer, and blaspheme the word? Do they not blaspheme the Son of God?

If we see that the Antichristian party is full of malice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God, against the Ministers of God, against the Saints of God, then know that sin is coming to its depth apace: So when the haters of the Lord are not bettered by judgments, but when the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hand of God is lifted up they trespass yet more against the Lord. These are signs that Antichrist is filling up his measure of iniquity, and so that the Redemption of <hi>Israel</hi> hasteneth.</p>

               <q>4. We may reason from that great and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral expectation which is in the hearts of the Lords people, that the salvation of <hi>Israel</hi> is near to be revealed.</q>

And besides <hi>Simeon,</hi> there were many other gracious souls which were then looking for the consolation of <hi>Israel,</hi> verse 38. yea, it was generally expected that Christ would then appear.

<pb n="42" facs="unknown:000143_0046_0FA263BAA2FFEA48"/>
expectations in the hearts of his people touching this matter: And that you see is strangely come to pass already, though I believe, many that have much confidence now, will ere long despair of ever seeing that which now they suppose (but very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonably as to the time) they shall see it may be the next year. Nevertheless it is not for nothing that the Lord hath raised such expectations in the world. And it is good for us from hence to draw a wise and sober encouragement unto faith and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that the Lord would be pleased to accomplish this work so much looked for, and hasten it in its season.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <q>5. We may argue from the works of God, that the salvation of <hi>Israel</hi> is near to be revealed.</q>
The present disposition of divine providence maketh it evident, that God is about some great work. And why may it not be this work, or in order to prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring things for this great day of <hi>Israels</hi> salvation? Consider well the workings of providence before this great and notable day which I am speaking of.
<q>There must be wonders in the heavens, and in the earth bloud, and fire, and pillars of smoke, the Sun shall be turned into darkness, and the Moon into bloud, <hi>Ioel</hi> 2.30, 31.</q>

And what if the providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial coming of Christ to destroy <hi>Rome,</hi> and to convert the <hi>Iews,</hi> should be signifyed by Comets and other prodigies?

Add to this, the present shakings and dashings of the Nations one against another, with that distress which is upon the earth; mens hearts failing them with expectation of what is coming, and the waves of many Nations begin to roar and lift up their voice, so must it be when the Redemption of <hi>Israel</hi> draweth nigh, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.25, 26, 27, 28.

of time intervene between the beginning, and the finishing of this work.</p>
            <p>Let us then consider, that there is 1. <hi>A prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory salvation</hi> of <hi>Israel.</hi> Hence we read of the way of <hi>the Kings of the East being prepared, Rev.</hi> 16.12.
<q>See also <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.7. As I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together bone to <hi>his bone.</hi>
               </q>
When this salvation of <hi>Israel</hi> shall begin, it will make <hi>a noise,</hi> and a sound all the world over, even such a noise as shall make the Nations stand amzed. The dead bones when they begin to stir will make a ratling all the world over, <hi>and a shaking</hi>: As when the <hi>Iews</hi> were returned out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> there was a noise and a shaking, for the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Empire was shaken in pieces, and all the earth was moved at the fall thereof. Even so when the twelve Tribes of <hi>Israel</hi> shall be saved, <hi>Babylon</hi> shall be shaken, the Turkish Empire shall be sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, <hi>the house of Austria</hi> shall be shaken, and other Kingdoms shall be shaken; and this shaking is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative: Read the verses following. 2. There is <hi>a plenary salvation</hi> of <hi>Israel.</hi> This doth not take place till after the destruction of <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog, i. e.</hi> the Turk, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 39.22. And (which will be at the same time) the utter abolition of the man of sin.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="1">"1. The work will be carryed on with speed. And this may well stand with what before was said. For that which is long in respect of us, considering our hasty expectations, is in it self speedy, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Luke</hi> 18.8. All motions when they come near their

center are most swift; As an arrow that is shot out of a bow, when it cometh near unto the earth is most speedy in its motion, so it is here. Hence it is said, that the <hi>Israelites at their return shall even fly,</hi> Isay 11.14. Besides the Lord Jesus is eager in his pursuit, when once he is near unto the possession of his glorious kingdom upon earth: As Satan when he knoweth that his time is but short, he rageth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, and doth more mischief than ordinary, so may we say that the Lord Jesus will do more good in destroying the great enemies of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, than in the ordinary course of his providence hath been known: So that Christ will do more work, and destroy more adversaries in a few years in the last times, than in many years in former days. The heart of Christ doth even long to be possessed of his kingdom, when he seeth the time is at hand. Therefore the Lord will hasten this work of <hi>Israels</hi> salvation in its season, <hi>Isa.</hi> 60.22. when once the wheel is set a going, when once the Lord is upon the wing, he will come leaping over the hills like a Roe upon the mountains.</p>

            <p>Heretofore there have been attempts (as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after may be said more abundantly) towards the salvation of <hi>Israel</hi> which have all ended in miserable disappointments: But when the appointed time is come (though stops &amp; seeming-retrograde motions there may be somtimes, that is a usual method of divine providence) it shall be carryed on success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully at last.

Tribes of <hi>Israel, Numb.</hi> 24.8. <hi>Zech.</hi> 9.13. For the Lord from heaven will fight for them: As when the Jewish state was destroyed by the <hi>Romans,</hi> the Lord did fight against them. And therefore <hi>Titus</hi> refused to be crowned for that victory <note n="(g)" place="margin">

            <p>And thus much may suffice for the <hi>second</hi> thing propounded to be spoken unto in the Doctrinal <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussion</hi> of that great truth which we have before us. In the <hi>third</hi> place we proceed to inquire into the <hi>Reasons</hi> of this point. Why the Tribes of <hi>Israel</hi> shall be saved? Briefly, there are such reasons as these to be assigned, why this salvation shall come to pass.</p>
            <p n="1">"1. Because of the free rich grace &amp; mercy of God: This was the very reason why God took the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> to be his people at first in the days of old, when they, and they only were the Militant Church, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.7, 8. And the same reason remaineth still to be given why the Lord will take them to be his people again. Why did not God cast off the <hi>Israelites</hi> soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? certainly they deserved it long before, but because of his own infinite grace and goodness, the Lord did not of a long time reject them. So he will not cast them off <hi>for ever,</hi> for the same reason: As the justice of God is a ground of the <hi>Israelites rejection, Rom.</hi> 11.22. So his mercy is a ground of their <hi>reception</hi> into divine favour again. Hence it
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:000143_0049_0FA263BCDFFEDF48"/>
is said, that the Lord doth this <hi>for his own sake,</hi> and not for the sake of any thing in the <hi>Israelites</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.44. &amp; 36.32.</p>
            <p>"<hi>R.</hi> 2. From the stability of Gods election, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.1. It is not possible that so much as one elect soul should miss of salvation, though all the <hi>deceivers on earth,</hi> and all the <hi>devils of hell</hi> should do their utmost to destroy such a soul, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.24. <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.12. Sure then it cannot be that an <hi>elect Nation</hi> should miss of salvation. Whence was it that some few of <hi>Israel</hi> were saved in the Apostles days, and not others as well as they? This was the reason, because some belonged to <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,</hi> which others did not, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.7. And this is one reason which the Apostle giveth in this Chapter, verse 28. to prove that a time will come when all <hi>Israel</hi> shall be saved, <hi>viz.</hi> because of <hi>electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Consider <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.16.</p>
            <p>"<hi>R.</hi> 3. <hi>Taken from the power of God:</hi> This also is another reason given by the Apostle in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to prove that the <hi>Israelites</hi> shall again be taken into Covenant with God, notwithstanding their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent rejection, because verse 23. <hi>God is able to graff them in again.</hi> And that God is able to do this diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult (and to nature and reason impossible) work, is proved in verse 24. from the calling of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> if (saith the Apostle) God hath called the <hi>Gentiles, and so contrary to nature graffed that which was wild into the good Olive tree</hi>: Sure then he is able to graff the <hi>Israelites, which are the natural branches into their own Olive tree:</hi> But God hath called the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is able to call the <hi>Iews</hi> again to become his people, therefore this shall be done.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="unknown:000143_0050_0FA263BDD93EAD50"/>Yea verily, such is the infinite power of <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah,</hi> that he is able to bring this mighty work to pass by a beck of his finger. Hence it is said, <hi>Zech.</hi> 10.8. <hi>I will hiss for them and gather them</hi>: The Lord can as easily gather the dispersed <hi>Israelites</hi> out of all corners of the earth, as a man can hiss, or whistle, or call a creature that will come to him with the beck of his hand. Such is the power of the great God. Alas, there are many in the world that these things seem incredible unto; but as the Apostle said to them, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.8. <hi>Why should it be thought a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Indeed if the work were to be done by men or Angels, or any creature alone, well might it be thought a thing incredible: But inasmuch as the great God, to who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> nothing is or can be too hard, (inasmuch as he who hath made heaven and earth) hath engaged his omnipotency to bring this work to pass, most certainly it shall be accomplished in the appointed time.</p>

               </q>
It must needs be that what ever God hath spoken by his holy Prophets should be accomplished, <hi>Isa.</hi> 44.6. Hence divers times in the Scripture it is said, that this and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing came to pass, that so that might be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led which was befo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="51" facs="unknown:000143_0050_0FA263BDD93EAD50"/>
declared by the Prophets,</hi> Rev. 10.7. Yea the truth is, that all the Prophets which have written since the world began have spoken more or less concerning this matter; for this you may see an express place of Scripture, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.21, 24. And let any man unto whom God hath given understanding, impartially search the writings of the Prophets, and he shall find that this was their great design, to fore-tell the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Messias</hi> his kingdom, which will appear after all <hi>Israel shall be saved.</hi> The truth is, that there is not any one prophetical book (the book of <hi>Ionah</hi> is rather an History than a Prophesie) in all the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, be it in Old Testament or in New, which doth not speak something concerning the salvation of <hi>Israel.</hi> Therefore this must needs be brought to pass.</p>
            <p>"<hi>R.</hi> 5. Because of the Covenant of God. This also is another reason used by the Apostle in this Chapter, to prove that all <hi>Israel</hi> shall be saved, ver. 27.28. And the strength of that argument lyeth in this, that the <hi>Covenant</hi> of God is <hi>everlasting.</hi> Hence it is said, verse 25. <hi>Blindness is hapned unto Israel but in part,</hi> i. e. their blindness is <hi>neither universal</hi> (for a remnant were saved in the Apostles days, verse 5.) <hi>nor perpetual</hi>; for because of Gods everlasting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, this blindness shall not be everlasting blindness. And if we observe the Scripture, we shall find, that the salvation of <hi>Israel</hi> is still ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon Gods Covenant.

            <p>And there is good reason why it should be thus, 1. Because they are as it were the Eldest Brother, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.25. <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.22. <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.27. The <hi>Iews</hi> were the people of God before the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> There was a time when they were the only Church upon earth, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.2. <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.22. So that the <hi>Gentile</hi>-Church which now is, is <hi>surrogate Israel,</hi> Rom. 11.17. and is therefore often called <hi>Israel</hi> in the book of <hi>Revelation.</hi> It is also observable, that the first Christian Church which ever was in the world did consist wholly of <hi>Iews, Rom.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.5, 6. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.46. &amp; 1.15.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <q>2. Because the <hi>Messias,</hi> the Lord Jesus Christ the Saviour of the world according to his humane nature, was <hi>an Israelite,</hi> Gen. 12.3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.16.</q>
And of the Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> Heb. 7.14. <hi>It is evident</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>that our Lord sprang out of Iudah</hi>: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though now the <hi>Iews</hi> have raised great controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies about the Genealogy of Christ, yet in those days it was so manifest that Jesus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> was sprung from <hi>Iudah,</hi> that no <hi>Iews</hi> (although such as denyed that Jesus was the Christ) could ever deny that he came of the Tribe of <hi>Iudah</hi>;
<q>Therefore the Apostle saith, that it is <hi>evident,</hi> our Lord came of <hi>Iudah, q. d.</hi> no man doubteth of that.</q>
For <hi>Messias</hi> came from the house of <hi>David, Acts</hi> 2.30. therefore he was of the Tribe of <hi>Iudah</hi>: And this is manifest, if
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:000143_0054_0FA2634DF56887F8"/>
we compare <hi>Matthews</hi> and <hi>Lukes</hi> Genealogy of Christ. <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of Christ was of the house of <hi>David. Eli</hi> was <hi>Marys</hi> natural father, for he was <hi>Iosephs</hi> legal Father (or Father-in-law) <hi>Luke</hi> 2.23. which is evident, because <hi>Iacob</hi> was <hi>Iosephs</hi> natural Father, <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.16. Therefore <hi>Mary</hi> being <hi>Elie</hi>'s Daughter, was naturally descended from the line and loins of <hi>David</hi>; Therefore Christ sprang of <hi>Iudah.</hi> It is true indeed, that Christ descended from <hi>Ruth,</hi> who was a <hi>Moabitess,</hi> to signifie that <hi>Gentiles</hi> should by him be saved as well as <hi>Iews,</hi> but the rest of his Predecessors were <hi>Israelites.</hi> Now this is the greatest thing which the <hi>Iews</hi> have to glory in, and that which maketh the <hi>Israelitish</hi> Nation to be above others desirable, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.7. Therefore the Apostle speaking of the priviledges and glories which the <hi>Israelites</hi> had above other people, mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth this in the last place, as being more than all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things that may be said or thought of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.5. As it is true, that the humane nature is exalted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Angelical nature in respect of Christ, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.20, 21. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.15. because it may be said that Christ is a man, but not that Christ is (in respect of nature) an Angel; So, in respect of Christ, the Jewish Nation is exalted above every Nation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it may be said that Christ was an <hi>Israelite,</hi> but not that he was of any other Nation.</p>

            <p>I know there have been many foolish dreams a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the renewal of the universe, the <hi>Platonical year,</hi> &amp;c. but doubtless the finger of Satan hath been deep therein, that so the glory of these truths might be unknown. I say then, it is an holy truth, that after the <hi>salvation</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> is <hi>consummate,</hi> the state and face of things will be quite altered through the world. Hence it is said, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.1. <hi>That when New Ierusalem cometh down from heaven, there shall be no more Sea</hi>: i. e. ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:000143_0057_0FA263502938E6F8"/>
there shall be no more corruptions in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or (which interpetation suiteth with the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical notion of Sea) the meaning is, that there will be no more such troubles and combustions, moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and commotions, dreadful shakings and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, as shall be in the world a little before the <hi>Iews</hi> conversion; but all things shall be quiet, and and calm, and peaceable, and days of glorious tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility throughout the earth. Hence it is said in the same verse, <hi>that there shall be a new heaven, and a new earth</hi>: i. e. a new state and face of the world. As this present state of the world is called <hi>a new world</hi> in respect of that which was before the floud, which is termed <hi>the old world,</hi> so the state of things after the consummation of <hi>Israels</hi> salvation, may in respect of this present state of the world be termed, <hi>a new world</hi>; for the world will then as far excel (and more) what the world now is, as the world at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent doth come short of what it was before the floud. Hence the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> saith, 2 <hi>Ep. chap.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 13.
<q>we, according to his promise, expect a new hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and a new earth, wherein dwelleth <hi>righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
               </q>
This cannot be meant meerly of the new Gospel-dispensation, because that was already come, whereas the Apostle speaketh of this as fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as a thing under expectation, and not under present fruition: Nor can it be meant of the state of glory in heaven, because the Apostle saith, <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his promise,</hi> which promise is in <hi>Isa.</hi> 65.17. and that speaketh expresly concerning a state here upon earth. Consider verse 21. Therefore the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the new heaven and earth, noteth a glorious renewal of this inferiour world; and therefore it is said, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.5. <hi>Behold I make all things new:</hi> Now
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:000143_0058_0FA2635102BFEB20"/>
many times things are altered for the worse, and not for the better; seldom hath there been any great reformation in the Church, but a sad after-clap hath come, that so that reformation might be seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with suffering: After that Paganry was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown by <hi>Constantine,</hi> then came a <hi>Iulian,</hi> who set it up again: And, you know that in our own Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on after that Popery was pulled down by our <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Iosiah</hi> (as he is usually and deservedly called) there came dark and bloudy <hi>Marian</hi> days, wherein Popery had another turn like the blaze of a snuff a little before utter extinction, but when <hi>Israels</hi> sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is consummate, the alteration will be no more for the worse, but for the better only. Now the truth of this will be evident, if you consider that those two principal things which put all the world out of order, shall then cease.
<q>For 1. <hi>One thing</hi> which puts all the world out of order is conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and division, <hi>Iam.</hi> 3.16.</q>
But when once the salvation of <hi>Israel</hi> is accomplished, the contentions and bitter strifes of men will be at an end. For the <hi>Israelites</hi> shall have unity and unanimity amongst themselves, <hi>Isa.</hi> 11.13. <hi>Ier.</hi> 32.39. Nor shall there be such schisms and divisions amongst <hi>Gentile</hi> Churches as hitherto hath been, to the infinite scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>al of Christian Religion. Before Popery got up, Christians were miserably divided amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that Pagans were wont to deride them upon their publick Theaters for their divisions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions one with another. And, since the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, what woful and most sinful heart-burnings have there been amongst the professors of a more pure Religion. Though <hi>the Reformation</hi> in respect of purity of Doctrine hath been a <hi>Sea of glass,</hi> yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:000143_0058_0FA2635102BFEB20"/>
of contentions (as well as persecutions from adversaries) amongst themselves, it hath been <hi>mingled with fire,</hi> Rev. 15.2. But after <hi>Israels</hi> sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation there will be no more of this; <hi>For there shall be one Lord, and his name one,</hi> and that <hi>over all the earth,</hi> Zech. 14.9. one shall not say, I am a <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist,</hi> and another I am a <hi>Lutheran,</hi> another I am th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, and another I am that; Such carnal schisms shall then be at an end.
<q>2. Another thing which bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth confusion upon the face of the world, is that desolating sin of <hi>persecution.</hi>
               </q>
Observe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and you shall find, that when God hath brought desolating and astonishing plagues upon the earth, it hath been chiefly for the sin of persecution. Hence come <hi>overturnings, overturnings, overturnings,</hi> hence come Wars, Plagues, Famines, Fires, and eternal desolations. What was that sin which ruined the four Monarchies? It was the sin of persecution. See <hi>Ier.</hi> 50.17, 18. <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.9, 12, 13, 14. And what was that sin which brought like a whirlwind of the Lord, destruction upon the Jewish state and Nation, and that long, and lasting, and most doleful ruine which continues to this day? It was because they perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted his Saints, and stopped <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> more persecution shall be heard of in the world, no not for a thousand years together. Nay, the Saints shall never more be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered into the hands of persecutors after this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious day, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 28.24. &amp; 45.8. The <hi>Iews</hi> of old were not to have any fire upon the Sabbath day, which might singnifie unto us, that, in that glorious <hi>Sabbatism,</hi> that rest for the people of God, which shall one day be upon this earth, there will be free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:000143_0059_0FA26351A2964F20"/>
from fires of contention and persecution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And this is manifest
<q>1. Because persecution is from the Devil.</q>
It is he that stirreth up wicked instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to molest the Servants of God for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness sake, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.10. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.18. Now Satan must be bound for a thousand years, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.1, 2, 3. "2. Because persecution is from Antichrist. The Devil and the Pope are the two great Authors of persecution. Look into the world, and you shall find, that where Saints are persecuted <hi>(i. e.)</hi> suffer for Righteousness) it is caused by Antichrist, or some Limb or Horn of Antichrist: But Antichrist shall be utterly destroyed (as hath been shewed) when the salvation of <hi>Israel</hi> shall be consummate. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the beast shall be slain, and his body gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto the burning flame, there will be no more destruction in all the Lords holy mountain.</p>
            <p>Thus have you heard the first particular, as to the kind and manner of <hi>Israels</hi> salvation, <hi>viz.</hi> that it will be <hi>glorious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Secondly, the salvation of all the Tribes of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> will be <hi>wonderful</hi> as well as glorious.</q>
And although it be true that what hath been said concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the glory of this day, doth sufficiently evince that it will be <hi>a wonderful day,</hi> nevertheless because I would not multiply too many particulars under one general head, therefore for methods sake, I chuse to mention this, as a distinct head from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. And the truth of this is further evident;
<q>1. Because the Scripture doth plainly express as much as this cometh to. <hi>scil.</hi> that the day of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raels</hi> salvation will be a wonderful day, <hi>Ioel</hi> 2.26.</q>
               <hi>You shall praise the name of the Lord your God that hath dealt wondrously with you,</hi> and verse 30. <hi>I will shew
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:000143_0059_0FA26351A2964F20"/>
wonders</hi> saith God, speaking concerning this very time of <hi>Israels</hi> conversion and salvation. Hence that day is called <hi>a great day,</hi> because God will then do great and wonderful things, such as the like shall not be again, <hi>Hos.</hi> 1. last, <hi>great shall be the day of Iezreel</hi>: By the day of <hi>Iezreel,</hi> is meant especially the day when the twelve Tribes of <hi>Israel</hi> shall be saved. Now this is said to be a great day, because then God will take unto himself his great power, and shew the <hi>greatness</hi> of his being, and holy Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, in working <hi>great</hi> deliverances, and in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying <hi>great</hi> enemies, and so as to cause <hi>great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration</hi> in the world. And hence also this salvation of <hi>Israel</hi> is called a <hi>Mystery,</hi> as in the verse before my Text, <hi>I shew you</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>a Mystery, that blindness is in part hapned to</hi> Israel, <hi>till the fulness of the</hi> Gentiles <hi>be come in, and so all</hi> Israel <hi>shall be saved.</hi> So that the mystery which the Apostle speaketh of is not only (as some have restrained the words) that blindness is hapned to <hi>Israel</hi>; Albeit that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a very mysterious thing, that they, which were once the people, and the only people of God, should be rejected by him for so long a time, well might the Apostle, even in that respect break forth into such an holy extasie and admiration, saying, <hi>O the depth both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how are</hi> his judgments unsearchable, <hi>and his ways past finding out</hi>? but that's not all the mystery; It is likewise <hi>a wonderful mystery,</hi> that this blindness, which is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to <hi>Israel,</hi> should only be a partial, and not an eternal blindness, that this blindness should last no longer than till the <hi>Gentiles</hi> have fulfilled their time; And that then <hi>all</hi> Israel <hi>should be saved</hi>: This is the wonder of wonders. As the conversion of
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:000143_0060_0FA263528BF700E8"/>
the <hi>Gentiles</hi> was a mystery made known unto the <hi>Iews, Eph.</hi> 3.9. So the conversion of the <hi>Iews</hi> is a mystery made known unto the <hi>Gentiles</hi>; yea, it is a most excellent admirable mystery; therefore it is called <hi>the mystery of God,</hi> Rev. 10.7. <hi>When the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Angel shall sound the Trumpet,</hi> the mystery of <hi>God shall be fulfilled:</hi> The mystery of God in that place may note the reversion of the Children of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> unto the Land of their Fathers, and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, together with the restauration of all things to their first glory. Now, why is it called, <hi>the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of God</hi>? Is not this one reason of it, to signifie unto us the <hi>divineness,</hi> and admirable excellency of the mystery? It's an usual <hi>Hebraism</hi> in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to express a thing that is superlatively excellent and admirable by the name of <hi>God.</hi> Thus we read of <hi>harps of God, and mountains of God,</hi> and <hi>Cedars of God</hi>: i. e. very excellent ones, so <hi>the mystery of God,</hi> i. e. a most excellent mystery. And therefore this salvation will be wonderful. For <hi>a mystery is</hi> as much as to say, <note n="(a)" place="margin">

The truth is, that never any Nation upon earth was under so dreadful an hand of God, so sore, and of so long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as the Jewish Nation hath been, and is: This and more is affirmed by our Saviour, <hi>Matt.</hi> 24.21. <hi>For there shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time; no, nor ever shall be</hi>: So that this last and most grievous tribulation of

the Jewish Nation. It is not only the greatest ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity that ever did befal any Nation since the world began, but the greatest that ever shall befal any people to the worlds end, that indeed one might wonder that ever the Nation should be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held in being in the midst of such wasting and woful judgments; Therefore it is added, verse 22. <hi>Except those days should be shortned, no flesh should be saved; but for the elects sake those days shall be shortned:</hi> The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, that such direful vengeance and wrath will befal the Jewish Nation, that were it not that there is an elect seed to proceed out of their Loins in due time to be called, that whole carnal Nation would be utterly destroyed.

Besides, there never was any Nation guilty of such prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wickedness as the Jewish Nation hath been guilty of, whereby they have infinitely provoked the most high to cast and cut them off for ever.</p>
            <p>I remember a writer of their own <note n="(d)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Iosephus</hi> of Wars of <hi>Iews.</hi> lib.</note> saith,

this (which is a <hi>wonderful</hi> thing) the providence of God hath so ordered, that this people doth not cease to be a Nation, no, nor ever shall do.

               <q>3. It is evident, that this salvation of <hi>Israel</hi> will be wonderful, because men are so unapt to believe it.</q>
The truth is, that there is a natural a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versness in the hearts of sinful men from giving due respect and credence to prophetical Scripture; such is the lamentable corruption of mens nature, that they are more apt to be taken with fond, foolish, false prophesies that have nothing of a divine inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in them, than with the blessed and holy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies contained in the Scriptures of truth, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.25. <hi>He said unto them, O fools, &amp; slow of heart to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all</hi> that the Prophets <hi>have spoken</hi>! So that even the Disciples of Christ may be slow of heart to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the <hi>things spoken by the Prophets.</hi> Yea, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded that it is one of the greatest sins of many that truly fear God, that they are so slow and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in searching into <hi>the things spoken by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi> Now this salvation of <hi>Israel</hi> is a principal
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:000143_0062_0FA26353DB0999B0"/>
               <hi>thing spoken of by the Prophets</hi>: Yea, all the Prophets have said something concerning this very thing; therefore men are slow to believe here. We may say concerning the salvation of the Jewish Nation, as was said of their destruction by the <hi>Caldeans,</hi> Hab. 1.5. <hi>Behold ye among the heathen, and regard and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der marvellously, for I will work a work in your days, which you will not believe though it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e told you.</hi> Even so when the salvation of <hi>Israel</hi> is come out of <hi>Sion,</hi> the Lord will work such a work as that the <hi>Gentile</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions shall wonder marvellously; yea, it will be such, that men will not believe it though they be told of it before-hand, and told of it too from the word of the Lord.</p>
            <p>As the <hi>Iews</hi> were very slow in believing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of the <hi>Gentiles, Acts</hi> 10.45. They of the <hi>circumcision were astonished because that on the</hi> Gentiles <hi>also was poured the gift of the holy Ghost</hi>: what? that the spirit of grace should be given to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> it was <hi>wonderful,</hi> even to astonishment. See also chap. 11. ver. 18. <hi>When they heard these things, they glorifyed God, saying, Then also hath God granted to the</hi> Gentiles <hi>repentance unto life, q. d.</hi> here's a strange thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed come to pass, here's such a thing as we little imagined, but men ever thought the contrary; what? that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> should have repentance to life given them. So the truth is, that <hi>Gentiles</hi> are too slow to believe the conversion of the <hi>Iews.</hi> Some there are that will not so much as believe the thing, that ever such a thing shall come to pass whilst the world standeth. Others there are that do believe the thing, but as to the manner of it, and that glory which shall follow, there they are at a stand, and know not how to believe; others again believe
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:000143_0063_0FA26354A4E2AC38"/>
both that the thing will be, and also that it will be a very glorious day, but as to the time when this shall be, they are exceedingly in the dark, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think that it will be so soon, as most certainly it will be: The time surely draweth on apace (as hath been shewed) and yet there are that do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that it will be these many score; nay, some hundreds of years. Thus are men, one way and another way, dis-believing concerning this great truth. Hence it is that so much is spoken of this matter in the holy Scriptures. I have many times thought on it with admiration that there is not any one thing in all the word of God more abundantly witnessed unto than this truth, <hi>that all</hi> Israel <hi>shall be saved</hi>: What should be the reason of that? doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less there are divers reasons for it; one is, because the Lord would not, by any means have his people ignorant of this great truth:
<q>Therefore the Apostle saith, Brethren I would not have you ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant that blindness is hapned to <hi>Israel,</hi> only till the <hi>Gentiles</hi> have fulfilled their times, and that then all <hi>Israel</hi> shall be saved; men are apt to think with themselves it is no great matter, though they be ignorant in such truths as these are, as being truths of a lesser concernment, and the men of the world are ready to think with themselves, what should they trouble themselves so about the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the <hi>Iews</hi>?</q>
But now God would not have such a spirit as that to be in his people; therefore the Lord layeth wait upon this point, and cometh over and over with it many an hundred time by his spirit in the mouths of his Prophets. Again, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reason why there is so much said in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture concerning this salvation of <hi>Israel,</hi> may be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:000143_0063_0FA26354A4E2AC38"/>
it is that which men are most unapt to believe, I cannot think the spirit of God would so often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate this truth, if there were not such a reason as that for it: And why, think you, are men so unapt to believe this truth? but because of the strangeness and wonder that is in it; It is a thing beyond humane sence and reason.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <q>4. It is evident, that the salvation of <hi>Israel</hi> will be wonderful, if we compare it with those former deliverances which in the days of old have been vouchsafed unto the Tribes of <hi>Israel.</hi>
               </q>
It is indeed true, that God hath in former times bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more eminent and wonderful salvations upon the <hi>Israelitish</hi> Nation that upon any Nation in the world, <hi>Psal.</hi> 147.20. <hi>He hath not dealt so with any Nation.</hi> It is true, in respect of deliverances and salvations which were vouchsafed unto them, as well as in respect of the Covenant, and Word, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of God which were bestowed on them, that God dealt not so with any Nation as with the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Nation; nevertheless, this salvation which we are now speaking of as <hi>yet to come,</hi> will be more wonderful than any of those former which hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have been. That deliverance of the <hi>Iews</hi> by <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> was very wonderful, yet nothing so wonderful as this will be, as is evident, because that was but a Type of this, and therefore it is, that in many places in the Scripture, the very same ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions are used to signifie both that deliverance out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and this which is to come; so the Vision of the dry bones in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> doth firstly refer to the <hi>Iews</hi> captivated in <hi>Babylon,</hi> but principally to the forlorn estate of the <hi>Iews</hi> at this day, and the like may be said concerning many passages in other
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:000143_0064_0FA2635575361200"/>
of the Prophets, that they do firstly concern the <hi>Babylonian</hi> condition of the <hi>Iews,</hi> but lastly their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent condition; but because that deliverance was a Type of this, therefore this will be the more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and wonderful, for the Type must needs come short of the Anti-type.</p>
            <p>Again, when the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> were brought up out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> it was a very wonderful delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; for God did then cause many great signs, and wonders, and miraculous demonstrations of his power and providence to be seen: Read <hi>Psal.</hi> 78.11, 12. <hi>He shewed them wonders, mavellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>and in the field of</hi> Zoan; what wonders, what marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous things? verse 12, 14, 19. <hi>He divided the Sea, and caused them to pass through, and he made the waters to stand as an heap, in the day time he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light fire, he clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths</hi>: And so the Psalmist goeth on to shew what won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Lord did for the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> when he brought them out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> And I am perswad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that God, whose ways are everlasting, when the time cometh that all <hi>Israel</hi> shall be saved, will do as great and glorious (yea greater) wonders <note n="(†)" place="margin">

Whether there will not be a particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection soon after the <hi>Iews</hi> conversion, is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie that I intend not here to meddle with, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is certain, that the ultimate, universal resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the dead will not be till long after that.

This is a mighty wonder: even so that the Jewish Nation, which have been perishing in a cruel grave, and there lain dead for many hundreds of years, to be made alive again, to say the least of it, it is a wonder.

The deeps of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are like unto a grave, and misery is a kind of <hi>living death</hi>; For comfort is the life of a mans life, and therefore affliction destroying a mans comfort, is justly called by the name of death, <hi>Psal.</hi> 44.16. <hi>Thou hast broken us in the place of Dragons, thou hast co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered us with the shadow of death,</hi> h. e. Thou <hi>hast brought sore</hi> and heavy calamity upon us, <hi>Isa.</hi> 56.10. <hi>we are as dead men in desolate places,</hi> i. e. we are in a very afflicted, miserable, forlorn estate. And also <hi>Psal.</hi> 88.4, 5, 6. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.6. And truly so may we say concerning the <hi>Israelitish</hi> Nation, it is an afflicted people, that indeed the very name of that Nation is called afflicted, <hi>Isa.</hi> 54.11. <hi>O thou afflicted, and

<q>2. The <hi>Israelitish</hi> Nation is said to be in a state of death, and of the grave in respect of sin.</q>
For sin is the most deadly death, it is such a death as killeth an immortal soul, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.22. <hi>let the dead bury their dead,</hi> i. e. le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> those that are spiritually dead, bury those that are corporally dead, let such as are dead in sin, go bury their dead relations, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.25. <hi>The hour now is that the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God,</hi> which (although it is true, that some which were corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally dead were not long after [that hour] Christ spake those words, quickned by the Son of God, yet it is true that the place) may be understood of a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual sinful death, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1, 5. <hi>You hath he quickned who were dead</hi>: How dead? <hi>In respect of Trespasse: and sins,</hi> so <hi>Col.</hi> 2.13. Now thus may we say concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Iews</hi> at this day, they remain in a state of sin, and therefore in a state of death: And how should it be otherwise, as long as they re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ect him that <hi>is the way, the truth, and the life</hi>? To live, and yet to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject him that is eternal life, is not possible. Well did the Lord Jesus say to them, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.24. <hi>Except you believe that I am he, you shall die in your sins.</hi> Now the wretched <hi>Iews</hi> will not believe that Jesus Christ is he, that Jesus Christ is the true <hi>Messias,</hi> the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the world, therefore they live, they die in sin: so then their salvation will be wonderful. For any one soul to be brought out of the grave of
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:000143_0067_0FA2635D454931F8"/>
sin, is wonderful, no less a wonder, than for a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that hath been rotting in the belly of the earth to be brought out alive from thence: But what a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle then will it be when a whole Nation shall be brought out of a grave of sin? who can chuse but wonder at the thought of it?</p>
            <p n="6">
               <q>6. This salvation of <hi>Israel</hi> will be the more wonderful, inasmuch as the <hi>Iews</hi> have heretofore many a time &amp; often made fruitless and miserable attempts to deliver themselves out of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <hi>tribulation.</hi>
               </q>
Such hath been the dreadful, dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful wrath of God against that stubborn and stiff neck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed people, that he hath left them often to be delud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with vain hopes and attempts of salvation. And there are two ways especially, whereby the <hi>Iews</hi> have vainly sought to deliver themselves. 1.
<q>By hearkning unto false Christs that have risen up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them.</q>
Thus the true <hi>Messias</hi> told the <hi>Iews</hi> that it would be, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.43. <hi>I am come in my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers name, and ye receive me not, if another shall come in his own name, him you will receive</hi>: As <note n="(m)" place="margin">

them enough of false Christs: we read of two or three false <hi>Messias</hi> in the Scripture.

And the truth of this is also held forth in this very verse wherein my Text is. <hi>All Israel shall be saved</hi> (saith the Text)
<q>
                  <hi>for a</hi> deliverer shall come out of <hi>Sion,</hi> and turn away ungodliness from <hi>Iacob.</hi>

So that the house of <hi>Iacob,</hi> even all <hi>Israel,</hi> must be saved from ungodliness: And of this same thing there is a promise, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.29. <hi>I will save you from all your uncleannesses.</hi> And admirable to this purpose is that place, <hi>Ier.</hi> 50.19, 20.
<q>I will bring again <hi>Israel</hi> to his habitation in those days; and at that time, saith the Lord, the iniquity of <hi>Israel</hi> shall be sought for, and there shall be none, and the sins of <hi>Iudah,</hi> but they shall not be found.</q>

Besides it is evident that they are so, because they have long, and long ago, ceased from being the Church and people of God. Therefore <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.11. we read of <hi>their fall,</hi> that is to say, their falling from that relation which once they stood in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and of their <hi>casting away,</hi> verse 15. and
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:000143_0073_0FA26362F354D2C8"/>
of their being <hi>broken off,</hi> verse 17. <hi>h. e.</hi> they are broken off from that Covenant and Church relation which once they stood in. This is true concerning the <hi>Israelites</hi> or ten Tribes, according to that, <hi>Hos.</hi> 1.9.
<q>call his name <hi>Loammi,</hi> for you are not my people, and I will not be your God.</q>
And it is true concerning the <hi>Iews</hi> or two Tribes, as we may see <hi>Zech.</hi> 11.10, 11.
<q>I took my staff Beauty and cut it asunder, that I might break my Covenant, which I had made with all the people, and it was broken in that day.</q>
Now inasmuch as they cease to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ways of the visible Church, therefore they are externally in the same capacity with the Pagan world, and therefore under Satans Regiment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is the <hi>Prince of the world, Iohn</hi> 16.11. why are excommunicate persons said to be <hi>delivered unto Satan,</hi> but because they are Authoritatively decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be no longer of the visible Church, <note n="(e)" place="margin">See <hi>Gelaspy Aarons Rod.</hi> p. 297.</note> but of the world, and therefore in the hands of Satan, who is the worlds God and Prince? Thus may we say concerning the Church of <hi>Israel,</hi> God hath given her a Bill of divorce, God hath excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated her for the present: But there is a day coming, when God will receive them into favour again, and then they shall be under the powers of darkness no longer, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.71.
<q>they shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the hands of their enemies, and from the hand of all that hate them, which words al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they are comprehensive of temporal, yet they are not exclusive of spiritual enemies.</q>
Besides, we read <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. That not long after the <hi>Iews</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version an Angel cometh down from heaven (<hi>i. e.</hi>)

               </q>
Indeed it is true, that first a civil life must enter into them, but after that a spiritual life. These two we have plainly distinguished <hi>one</hi> from the other, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.7, 8. <hi>the bones came together, bone to its bone, but there was no breath in them:</hi> Here is a civil life, for bone cometh to his bone, but no spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual life, for as yet there is no breath in them; even so, when the day of <hi>Israels</hi> salvation cometh, we must first expect to hear that the <hi>Iews</hi> are gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring together out of one Countrey, and out of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Country, and making head toward their own Land, before we hear of their conversion, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, it followeth therefore, verse 14. It is said, <hi>I will put my spirit in you, and you shall live.</hi> This spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual life is in regenerating grace, when the day of Gods power passeth over the soul to make it willing and obedient. Converting grace may well be called life, because it maketh them that were dead to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come alive, therefore it is said concerning the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted prodigal, <hi>He was dead, but he is alive</hi>: Also because grace is the inchoation, the seed, the bud of eternal life and glory. <hi>Grace reigns to eternal life, Romans</hi> 5. last, <hi>holiness ends in everlasting life.</hi> chap. 6.22. Likewise grace is rightly called <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual life,</hi> because the Author of it is the blessed spirit of God, therefore all saving graces are said to be the <hi>fruits of the spirit.</hi> Gal. 5.22. And <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.5. It is said, <hi>except a man be born of water, and of the spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God, i. e.</hi> except he
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:000143_0074_0FA26363F7B162A0"/>
be regenerated by the spirit of God, whose opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are like unto water, to cleanse, and purge, and purifie the soul. Now, thus it true, that the Tribes of <hi>Israel</hi> shall have converting grace bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon them. The Lord hath promised <hi>to put his fear into their hearts,</hi> Jer. 32.40. And this is one thing intended in the Text, when it is said, <hi>that all</hi> Israel <hi>shall be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng all the Tribes of <hi>Israel,</hi> therefore it is said, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.30. <hi>All the Tribes of the earth shall mourn</hi>; which, that it is (in part at least) meant of a penitential mourning, I doubt not. As when the children of <hi>Israel</hi> were brought out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a civil, but a spiritual life was conferred upon them, according to that Scripture, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.6.
<q>
                  <hi>When I</hi> passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thy own blouds, I said unto thee in thy blouds, live; yea I said unto thee in <hi>thy blouds, live, h. e.</hi> when I saw thee under bloudy bondage by reason of <hi>Egyptian</hi> Task-masters, when there was a bloudy proclamation gone forth out of <hi>Pharoahs</hi> Court, that all thy Male children should be destroyed, then I looked upon thee, and caused a political life to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into thee, and when thou wer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </q>
So it is in the like sort true, that when all <hi>Israel shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> not only a life of liberty, but a life of grace shall enter into them.</p>

<pb n="105" facs="unknown:000143_0077_0FA263660926DD70"/>
This I believe is the true scope of the Apostle in those words. Moreover, it is conceived by some, that the reason why the Saints, whom Christ shall find alive at his coming, must be <hi>caught up to meet the Lord in the air,</hi> 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4.17. is, that so they might escape that conflagration whereby the wicked upon the earth shall be destroyed: As in the days of <hi>Noah</hi> when the world was destroyed by water, they that were not in the Ark perished: So when the day cometh that the world shall be destroyed by fire, (which fire <note n="(o)" place="margin">

Nevertheless, I do not think hat it is any Heresie to believe (though I am not of that perswasion) that <hi>the rapture of the Saints into the air</hi> to meet Christ will not be at his next coming to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy Antichrist, and to set up his glorious kingdom upon earth (which coming of Christ some great Divines look upon rather as a personal appearance, than a personal residence upon earth) but that this <hi>rapture</hi> will be at Christs coming to destroy <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> at the ultimate judgment, when the Lord will be for a long time resident in this lower world.

Albeit 'tis true that there shall be an eminency of gifts and grace among them, yet it is a vain thing to dream of a state of perfection upon earth before the last day.

Therefore there will not be an absolute freedom from sin.

It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed true, that before the Resurrection of Christ divers were raised from a state of death unto life, who yet were afterwards subject unto sin.

the Prophet <hi>Ionah,</hi> if so, to be sure he had more than a little of sin and corrupt nature in him after his Resurrection. Thus also may we conceive of <hi>Lazarus</hi> and others mentioned in the Scripture, as rising from the dead before our Saviours Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. And that they were subject unto sin, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, because they dyed again; And that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, because Jesus Christ was <hi>the first born from the dead,</hi> 
               <note n="(r)" place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Ieanes</hi> on <hi>Col.</hi> 1.18.</note> 
               <hi>Col.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Acts</hi> 26.23. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5. Now, why is Christ said to be the first born from the dead? Is it not, because he is the first that had a Resurrection, even a Resurrection to a state of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality? Though there were others that rose from the dead before Christ, yet their Resurrection was not perfect, for they dyed again, stand in need of another Resurrection unto immortality, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Christ is the first born from the dead.</hi> But at the last day, all the Saints shall be raised unto a sinless immortal state. And this is manifest, because <hi>the last enemy which shall be destroyed is death,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.26. But if the Saints after their Resurrection should be subject unto sin, there would be another enemy far worse than death, <hi>scil.</hi> sin to be destroyed after the abolition of death, which is expresly contrary to what the holy Apostle faith.</p>
            <p>And hence we read concerning <hi>the new Ierusalem, which cometh down from God out of heaven</hi> (which new <hi>Ierusalem</hi> I take to be the very same with the first Resurrection spoken of, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.) that there is in it <hi>nothing that defileth,</hi> nor any besides such <hi>whose names are written in the Lambs book of life,</hi> Revel. 21.27.</p>

I say I doubt not to affirm to you, that there will be such a day, when the Saints upon earth shall do the will of God with as much perfection as it is now done by the Angels of heaven. But stay a while, look not for that day till <hi>the Resurrection of the just,</hi> and then you shall see it. So that it is a great &amp; a precious truth, that there will be a day when the Saints of God shall even up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth be for a long time in a sinless glorious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state. For the day of judgment will be upon earth; For where should men be judged, but in the place where they have lived, either to the honour or to the dishonour of the great God and Judge of all the earth? Therefore <hi>Iob</hi> speaks, as you find chap. 19. verse 25.26. <hi>I know</hi> (saith he) <hi>that my Redeemer li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, and that he shall stand at the latter day, (i. e.</hi> the day of Judgment) upon the earth, <hi>and that in my flesh I shall see God,</hi> so <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.4. It is said, <hi>his feet shall stand in that day upon the Mount of Olives.</hi> And as it is true, that <hi>the judgment</hi> will be upon the earth, so likewise it shall be <hi>a day of long continuance.</hi> Can a world of men, even all that have been alive from <hi>Adam,</hi> to the last man that ever shall be born

into the world; I say, can all those millions of milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men and women that have been, are, or ever shall be upon the earth, be called to a particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for all the words, thoughts, and actions of their lives? can the secrets of all hearts be disclosed in the hearing of heaven and earth in a little space of time? No verily, but the preparation for <hi>eternal judgment</hi> will take up more time than a few weeks, or moneths, or ages. I do believe, that <hi>a thousand years</hi> will be but a part, <hi>a morning</hi> as it were, <hi>of that great and last day,</hi> after which all things must be swallowed up in the amazing gulf of an endless eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>Moreover, we may argue thus. <hi>The world to come</hi> will be of long continuance. Consider <hi>Isa.</hi> 66.22. Hence this world to come is called, an everlasting kingdom.

See <hi>Zech.</hi> 10.4. <hi>out of him</hi> (i. e. out of <hi>Israel) came forth (or shall come forth,</hi> for the words are a Prophesie of what shall be, and not an History of what hath been) <hi>the corner, out of him the nail,</hi> i. e. the Magistrates and Rulers, who are compared unto corner stones, and to nails, because the safety of the whole building and body politick greatly depends upon them; <hi>out of him the battel bow,</hi> i. e. the Military man, <hi>out of

               <q>So <hi>Isa.</hi> 14.2, 3. They shall take them captives, whose cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives they were; and they shall rule over their oppressors. And it shall come to pass in that day that the Lord shall give them rest from their sorrows, and from their fears, and from the hard bondage wherein they were made to serve.</q>
See also Chap. 60. verse 14. with <hi>Ezek.</hi> 39.10.</p>
            <p>Nor shall any amongst themselves oppress their poor brethren. Indeed it hath been so formerly, which caused the Apostle to use that interrogation, <hi>do not rich men oppress you?

<q>The Prince shall not take of the peoples inheritance by oppression.</q>
               <hi>Isa.</hi> 60.17. <hi>I will make thy officers peace, and thy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actors righteousness.</hi> For it is observable, that the children of <hi>Israel</hi> were not subject unto oppression from their own Rulers, until such time as they cast off that <hi>Theocraty,</hi> or Government by Judges which was of divine appointment. See 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.3.

So that after the time cometh that the <hi>Iews</hi> shall mourn, that they shall look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him whom they have pierced and mourn bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they shall no more lie in the ashes of affliction and outward calamity.

<q>God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no sorrow, nor crying, nor any more pain, for the former things are passed away.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <q>3ly, The truth is further evident, in that there will a day come, when the <hi>Israel</hi> of God shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy length of dayes as to natural or corporal life.</q>

            <p>As if <hi>Adam</hi> had never sinned, he had enjoyed a natural life upon earth for a long time.

When it was said to <hi>Adam, Do and live,</hi> the meaning was, Thou shalt then live a long and happy life upon earth: even so when God shall make all things new, the Saints shall be wonderfully delivered from natural, as well as spiritual death. Therefore it is said that

when new <hi>Ierusalem</hi> cometh down from heaven, <hi>there shall be no more death.</hi> And of this we have a promise made to <hi>Israel, Hos.</hi> 13.14.

The meek shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit not only heaven, but the earth, heaven and earth are theirs, they have a right to both in respect of the promise; they are heirs of God, and joynt heirs with Christ. The meek, for the present, how do they inherit the earth, when the wicked turn them off from the earth at their pleasure? well, but the time will come, <hi>when they shall inherit the earth.

Yea they were never called into question until the third or fourth Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, when Antichrist began to rise. And then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it was high time that those truths, which do so much concern the glory of <hi>the kingdom of the Messias,</hi> should be opposed and obscured, when the great enemy of Christ began to get head in the world. And ever since, albeit some of the Lords Worthies have born witness unto these very truths, yet they have been exceedingly darkned; partly by those that have gone beyond what is written in the word, and partly by those that have set themselves to oppose what the word saith. Nevertheless, if these be (as I am perswaded verily they are) <hi>the faithful and true sayings of God</hi>; it will be our great sin, if we should neglect to search into them: But how sinful a thing then must it needs be to oppose and contemn these Mysteries of God?</p>
            <p>Thus have you heard the <hi>Doctrinal part</hi> of this great truth concerning <hi>Israels salvation</hi> spoken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Only, before we proceed to infer any uses from the Doctrine, thus far (as the Lord hath holpen) treated upon, it may not be amiss to remove some objections, which may be made against the things delivered, especially against this last particular, of a <hi>glory upon earth, yet to come to the Saints of God.</hi>

            <p>Now then by applying this distinction, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the objection is clear &amp; easie, <hi>viz.</hi> that the first coming of Christ should not at all be according to the <hi>Iews</hi> expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in respect of visible glory, but at the first he was to come in the form of a Servant, as an abject a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst men, and to be abhorred of his own Nation according to the savings of the Prophets; but the second coming of Christ shall be <hi>in as great visible</hi> (and yet spiritual) <hi>glory</hi> as ever the <hi>Iews</hi> expected that the coming of <hi>Messias</hi> would be, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.30.
<q>
                  <hi>They shal</hi> see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory, and Chap. 25.31. The Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy Angels with him; then shall he sit upon the Throne of his glory.</q>
And hence it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable, that Christ did never absolutely deny his having such <hi>a visible glorious kingdom upon earth,</hi> as that which his Disciples then looked for, only he cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected their errour as to the time of this kingdoms appearing. The Disciples said,
<q>
                  <hi>Lord</hi> wilt thou at this time restore the kingdom to <hi>Israel?</hi>
               </q>
               <hi>Acts</hi> 1.6. Christ did not say to them, that there should never <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

kingdom should indeed be as they (for the substance of it) did from the holy Prophets expect; Thus, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.11.
<q>There were some that thought that the kingdom of God would immediately appear.</q>
Now therein was their errour; not in expecting a glorious appearance <hi>of the kingdom of God,</hi> but in that they made account this would be <hi>immediately.</hi> Whereupon our Saviour, to correct that errour as to the time of his <hi>kingdoms coming,</hi> speaketh a Parable of a certain noble man that went into a far Country to receive for himself a kingdom, and so to return. What is this far Country, but heaven? when Jesus Christ ascended to heaven, then he began his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious kingdom: Hence our Saviour said, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.1.

<q>There were (saith he) some malicious <hi>Iews,</hi> who out of envy at the truth informed the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, that such and such persons were, as concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the flesh, near akin unto Christ; whereupon the Emperour sent for those persons, intending to have killed them; but when he heard them say, that the kingdom of Christ was not of a terrene, but only of a celestial nature, he dismissed them without doing them any hurt.</q>
And hence it is, that the kingdom of Christ is not carryed on by earthly and carnal, but by spiritual weapons, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. <hi>our weapons are not carnal.</hi> The kingdoms of this world how are they got? and how are they

And this interpretation suiteth exactly with the scope of our Saviour in the place alledged, therefore he saith, <hi>his servants do not fight</hi>; It is therefore a woful mistake in those men, who say, <hi>that the Saints, as such,</hi> must take up arms and destroy the ungodly of the world before them, and when they have done so, they will invite Christ to come from heaven and reign over them.

Some deny that ever the Saints shall have a glorious kingdom upon the earth; others say, that it shall be, but long before Jesus Christ cometh to judge the world.

<q>

See also <hi>Isa.</hi> 44.23. And hence the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.20, 21, 22,

23. giveth us to understand, that the creature which is at present subject to corruption, <hi>h. e.</hi> the air which may become Pestilential and unwholsom, and so subject unto corruption in that respect; and the water which may be corrupted and distempered with winds, and storms, and tempests; and the earth which is subject to blastings with the fruits thereof, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> shall be delivered from this subjection to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption at the time when the bodies of the Saints shall be redeemed from the power of the grave, as well as freed from molestation and oppression by wicked and unreasonable men. Hence <hi>Psal.</hi> 49.14. It is said, <hi>the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning:</hi> So that there will a day come when the Saints of God shall have dominion over the wicked; yea, over all the rich and great ones a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the wicked of the earth (according to the scope and context of that place) but when will this day of the upright's dominion be? even in <hi>the morning, i. e.</hi> at the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of the just</hi> (as <note n="(w)" place="margin">

heaven shall be given to the Saints, the judgment shall sit. Now, that by the judgment fitting is meant, <hi>the great day of judgment,</hi> is to me past a doubt. For whence is that term of <hi>the day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>? we do not find it in the old Testament, but often in the new. And the reason why Christ and his Apostles used that term, was, because it was much used in the Church of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and had a Scripture foundation. Hence we read of the day of judgment more frequently in the <hi>Iews</hi> writings then in the new Testament it self. Now the <hi>Iews</hi> took up that term, <hi>of the day of judgment,</hi> from the 7th. Chap. of <hi>Dan.</hi> Therefore no doubt but that by the <hi>judgment sitting,</hi> is meant the <hi>great day of judgment</hi>; therefore till <hi>that day</hi> the kingdom un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the whole heaven cometh not into the hands of the Saints. Again, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.19. The times of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing
<q>are said to be from the presence of the Lord.</q>
Therefore Jesus Christ will be personally present (and that he will not be till the judgment) when the times of refreshing shall come. And in the Scripture <hi>the day of judgment</hi> is described by <note n="(z)" place="margin">

And in <hi>vers.</hi> 21. It is plainly expressed, that in the glorious time of the restitution of all things, Jesus will come again from heaven. And is not 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.7. a clear place to prove, that the glorious <hi>Sabbatism</hi> which remains for the Saints upon earth will begin at Christs coming from heaven to judge the world? Hence also Christs kingdom is said to be at the time of his appearing to judge the quick and the dead, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. And <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.15.
<q>the seventh Angel sounded, and there were great voices in heaven, saying, the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ, and he shall reign for ever <hi>and ever.</hi>
               </q>
So that when the time cometh that all the kingdoms of the world shall become the kingdoms of the Lord, and of his Christ, the seventh Angel sounds the Trumpet. Now by the seventh Trumpet (as <note n="(c)" place="margin">

               </note> Interpreters do very unanimously carry it) we are to understand the last Trump, which shall usher in the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the dead, and the day of judgment, wherefore <hi>vers.</hi> 18.

which destroy the earth.</q>
By all these Scriptures then it is abundantly evident, That the glorious kingdom which Christ with his Saints shall have upon earth, will not be till the great day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Only remember that the Scripture speaks of a first and a second resurrection, and so of a first and an ultimate judgment. For as in a day there is an evening and a morning, so in this great day, even the day of judgment, there is an evening and a morning: The one containeth that blessed thousand years <hi>Iohn</hi> speaketh of, the other containeth that space which shall be between the resurrection of the unjust, and the time when Christ shall give up his Mediatory kingdom, when God shall be all in all.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Youl say, but this is cold comfort for us, we expected a glorious time for the Saints upon earth to be at hand, but you tell us that that great glory promised to the Saints upon earth, when new <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi> cometh down from heaven, is not to be expected before the day of judgment.</q>

If any <hi>love not the Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> which words are an Hebraism, the meaning is, if any maliciously blaspheme the Lord Jesus Christ, <hi>let him be anathema, i. e.</hi> accursed; <hi>maranatha,</hi> i. e. <hi>the Lord cometh,</hi> the meaning is, let the curse of God remain upon him till dooms day. So that <hi>the day of

judgment</hi> is signifyed by that expression of <hi>the Lords coming.</hi> Furthermore, in the 9th.

<q>It is said the Lord hath prepared his Throne for judgment, and he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the people in <hi>uprightness.</hi>

So that when <hi>Muth-labben,</hi> when the death of the son of perdition shall come, the Lord will sit upon his Throne judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the world. But the final ruine of Antichrist cannot be far off. It is certain that the time, times, and half a time allowed for Antichrists reign is very far spent; therefore the day of judgment draws on apace.

For the <hi>Iews</hi> (as hath been shewed) shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted before the day of judgment. And <hi>Rome</hi> (though not the whole Antichristian state) will be destroyed before the coming of Christ; and the resurrection of the two witnesses will take place before the sounding of the 7th. even towards the conclusion of the 6th. Trumpet. Consider <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.11, 12. So that there must be <hi>an heaven</hi> established in the world which shall put great respect upon the slain and silenced witnesses of Jesus Christ, <hi>h. e.</hi> God will shake the <hi>European</hi> Nations (this once more he will shake not the earth only, but the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven)

until he hath brought forth such higher powers as shall promote the interest of Jesus Christ and his Saints. That I take to be meant by <hi>heaven,</hi> even <hi>an higher power.</hi> For so the Prophetical strain runs. Hence the ruine of the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> is described by saying, <hi>how art thou fallen from</hi> heaven <hi>O Lucifer</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the destruction of the state of <hi>Idumea</hi> is set forth by saying, <hi>the Lord will hath his sword in heaven,</hi> the overthrow of the <hi>Roman</hi> Pagan higher powers is called <hi>a departure of the heavens as a scroll:</hi> And hence it is said, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.8. The Dragon <hi>found no more place in heaven, i. e.</hi> Pagans were no more suffered to be in any place of Authority, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus when it is said, that the witnesses must hear a great voice <hi>from heaven,</hi> it argueth that an higher power shall be established in the world, which will highly advance and honour the faithful witnesses of Jesus Christ. Now by comparing the word and works of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. I cannot but be perswaded, that the Lord is even now about to bring this great work to pass, though <hi>in such a way as shall astonish all the earth.</hi> It may be in such a way, and by such means as that you read of <hi>Iudg.</hi> 7.22. And 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.23. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever sure it is, that when the witnesses are raised, 'tis by <hi>a spirit of life from God, h. e.</hi> the thing will be effected by the mighty wonder-working hand of Divine Providence. Likewise this work must be brought to pass suddenly and unexpectedly, which may possibly be intended when it is said, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.12. The witnesses <hi>ascended in a cloud, h. e.</hi> not only with the acclamations of a multitude, as thick as clouds, <hi>Isa.</hi> 60.8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1. but suddenly and unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly. For the clouds fly swiftly, and when the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is clear many times, speedily and unexpectedly
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:000143_0097_0FA26390A75876C8"/>
it is over-spread with clouds. Therefore in the Prophetical strain, a sudden and strange event is signifyed by the notion of <hi>a cloud.</hi> Consider <hi>Ier.</hi> 4.13. &amp; <hi>Isa.</hi> 19.1.</p>
            <p>Thus have we done with the <hi>Doctrinal part</hi> of this great Truth, concerning <hi>Israels salvation.</hi> We pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed now (as the Lord shall help) to <hi>infer</hi> some <hi>Uses</hi> from the Doctrine delivered.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Use</hi> 1. Is it so that <hi>the time will surely come</hi> when all <hi>Israel</hi> shall partake of such a salvation as that which hath been spoken of? Hence then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that we should labour to be acquainted with these Truths which do concern the Mystery of God in <hi>Israels</hi> salvation.</q>
Indeed if these things were cunningly devised fables, or if they were but the uncertain conjectures of men, we might be held excused, though we should not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow precious time in looking into them; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as they are things <hi>that shall surely come to pass,</hi> the evil will be great if we should not look into these holy Mysteries. We may say of these things, as the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> spake concerning that dream which God sent upon <hi>Nebuchadnezar,</hi> Dan. 2.45.
<q>
                  <hi>the dream</hi> is certain, and the interpretation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is sure.</q>
Now part of that dream was concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the kingdom of Jesus Christ, first, as a little stone, by the power of his word and spirit, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing the world; and after that as a great mountain filling the whole earth. So that there will a time come when the kingdom of Christ shall be esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished all the earth over, <hi>the thing is certain and sure.</hi> And therefore <hi>Iohn</hi> (or Christ by <hi>Iohn</hi>) speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concerning that new heaven, and new earth
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:000143_0098_0FA263922FEB6CF0"/>
which shall be when part of heaven shall come down upon the earth, <hi>sc.</hi> when new <hi>Ierusalem</hi> shall come down from God out of heaven, saith, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> such things as God will faithfully and truly perform, that nothing shall be unfulfilled of all those sayings which the mouth of the Lord hath spoken. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore these are sayings not to be neglected.</p>
            <p>Now in the prosecution of this <hi>Use,</hi> two things may be attended. 1. To lay down some Motives to stir us up to search into these mysterious things. 2. Some Rules of direction to be observed, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to attaining the knowledge thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <q>For Motives consider 1. The divine excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency which is in these mysterious truths.</q>
Indeed all truth is of a divine original. God is the Author of all truth, because he is the Author of all being, and truth and being are the same: As all goodness is originally from the goodness of God, so all truth is originally from the truth of God: Hence God is called, <hi>the God of truth,</hi> and his spirit, <hi>the spirit of truth</hi>; because <note n="(a)" place="margin">

Hence the prophetical book of the new Testament
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:000143_0098_0FA263922FEB6CF0"/>
is called by the name of <hi>Revelation,</hi> Rev. 1.1. <hi>The revelation of Iesus Christ</hi>; why Revelation? but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the things contained in that book, had never been known amongst the sons of men, had it not been for the extraordinary Revelation of the spirit of Christ. As <hi>the Gospel</hi> is said to be <hi>by revelation, Gal.</hi> 1.12. because the mysteries of the Gospel are not learned out of the book of Nature. So the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies of God's word are called <hi>Revelation,</hi> because the things therein contained had never been known unto the world, but by and from the <hi>Revelation</hi> of the spirit.</p>
            <p>Besides, it is evident, that there is some peculiar excellency in these mysteries which concerns the glory of Christs kingdom upon earth, because it hath been the great design of Satan to obscure, and darken, and hide these truths from the world. From the great subtilty of Satan it hath come to pass that some men of very corrupt minds have asserted that <hi>Messias</hi> shall have a glorious kingdom upon the earth, Some <note n="(b)" place="margin">So say <hi>Eusebius</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin.</hi> But it may be questioned whether <hi>Cerinthus</hi> did indeed hold any such opinion, for neither <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> nor <hi>Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> nor yet <hi>Epiphanius</hi> do mention any such thing to be amongst the Errours of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthus.</hi>

Let no one say, then we will not labour after the knowledge of these truths, if they are of a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantial nature only: By the same reason you may say that you will not labour to be acquainted with the order which God hath appointed for the Government of his Church which is his house, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the knowledge of those things is extra-funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental; yet surely we should labour to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted not only with matters of faith, but of order; not only with matters of Doctrine, but with matters of Worship and Discipline: But inasmuch as these truths concerning Christs kingdom are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra-fundamental, therefore the knowledge of them is difficult<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And inasmuch as the knowledge of them is difficult, therefore the truths are excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</p>
            <p>Furthermore it is evident, that there is a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar excellency in these truths, because the right knowledge of them maketh one blessed.

Some there are that as to the word of exhortation or practise, that they take heed unto, and that is so far well, but as to the word of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or prophesie, they never heed that, in which neglect they do not well; but ill. Certainly if it be a duty incumbent upon those to whom the Lord hath committed the word, to preach of these truths concerning <hi>the restauration of Israel,</hi> then it must needs be a duty incumbent upon people to seek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the knowledge of these truths. But the former of these is true, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.10.

                  <hi>Hear</hi> the word of the Lord, O ye Nations, and declare it in the Isles afar off, and say, he that scattered <hi>Israel</hi> will ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther him.</q>

               </gap>d with such truths as these are. Indeed men do ill as to themselves, they wrong themselves exceedingly when they neglect to search into these very truths: For it is said, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. <hi>That all Scripture is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,</hi> therefore they that neglect prophetical Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, sin against their own spiritual profit and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. And <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4. The Apostle saith not that some things only,
<q>but that <hi>whatsoever things</hi> were written afore-time, were written for our <hi>learning.</hi>
               </q>
He doth not say that matters of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice were written for our learning, but as for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of prophesie they were written for no bodies learning; the Apostle never spake such a word as that, but he affirms the quite contrary: But especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the evil of this neglect appears, in that it is great ingratitude unto the most high God for the riches of his grace in condescending to make known his counsels unto the Sons of men. Shall <hi>Iehovah,</hi> who humbleth himself to look upon the things that are done in heaven, condescend so infinitely as to make known his eternal counsels unto men upon the earth. And shall he speak unto us concerning this Mystery of <hi>the restitution of all things,</hi> not only by one, or two, or three, but by the mouth of all his Prophets? And yet shall we mortals be so ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and so wretched, as to take no notice of what the Lord hath spoken? shall they be as words spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the air? shall we let these truths lie by us as if they were of no use? God forbid that it should

It is true, that when the book was in his belly, it was bitter, the meaning of which may be, that bitter afflictions should befal the Church during the reign of Antichrist, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of those calamitous events, the book is said to be bitter in his belly. But in his mouth it was sweet as honey, to signifie to us that the understanding of prophesies is a most sweet and comfortable thing. And thus also the Prophet <hi>Ieremy, Chap.</hi> 31.26.
<q>upon this I awaked, and beheld, and my sleep was sweet unto me, <hi>h. e.</hi> he had newly had a Vision concerning the salvation of all the Tribes of <hi>Israel,</hi> and <hi>upon this,</hi> his sleep was <hi>sweet</hi> unto him.</q>

The truth is, that whilst a man is dwelling upon these meditations, he is as it were in heaven upon earth, he hath fellowship with the Angels in heaven;
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:000143_0102_0FA2637352BF7040"/>
whence the Angel said unto <hi>Iohn, I am thy fellow servant, and of thy brethren the Prophets.</hi> When men of God in former times have had their minds taken up with divine Visions, Angels of God have been with them; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> so it is with the servants of God at this day, though the Ministery of the holy Angels be more secret, spiritual and invisible, than some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times formerly. When the servants of the Lord are reading, or writing, or meditating, or praying concerning these Mysteries to the great God of Heaven and Earth, the blessed Angels are standing by them all the time; and no doubt but that the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven spirits which stand before the Throne of God, are instruments of much grace and peace towards his servants, especially when they are ingaged in such a work as this is: But there is that which is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than fellowship with Angels, even communion with the blessed holy God is to be enjoyed in these Meditations. Yea, much of God is to be seen and felt in these studies. It is said that the Lord hath <hi>made darkness pavillions round about him,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.12.
<q>And doth not <hi>Solomon</hi> say, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.1. The Lord hath said that he would dwell in the thick <hi>dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> even so it is most true, that God dwelleth in the dark prophesies of his word.</q>
               <hi>There</hi> he is to be seen, <hi>there</hi> are the breathings of his spirit, <hi>there</hi> is a presence of God that is unutterable.</p>
            <p>And this I may affirm to you, that if there be any man which hath not had communion with God in looking into these Mysteries (which Angels love to pry into) either it is because he hath no grace in his soul, and these Mysteries indeed are such things as an unregenerate heart can find no sap, nor favour in them. They are the deep things of the spirit of
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:000143_0102_0FA2637352BF7040"/>
God, which being spiritually discerned, the natural man cannot see any beauty in them; nay, his heart secretly riseth against them; or else it is because of ignorance and unacquaintedness with the truth of these Mysteries, that a man seeth not much of God in them. And so it is too sadly true, that some of the Lords own children may have very low and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy thoughts concerning these Mysteries, <hi>scil</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> through their weakness and ignorance in the Truth. Thus we read concerning the <hi>Disciples</hi> themselves, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.11. that when they were told of Christs Resurrection, they looked upon those <hi>words as idle tales, and believed them not</hi>: So there are that look upon the things that concern <hi>the first Resurrection</hi> as dreams not to be believed. As if these things were only the airy, empty speculations of some men with notions above the clouds: But as for those whose understandings God hath opened to <hi>conceive</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi> these truths they see a glory in them above the world, that eye hath not seen, nor tongue can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Consider</hi> 4. That the time wherein the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God shall be finished draweth on apace. The salvation of all <hi>Israel,</hi> it is now near to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed.</q>
And this is a marvellous incouragement, to look into this Mystery of <hi>Israels</hi> salvation. For inasmuch as the time of fulfilling prophesies it at hand, we may hope that they shall be unsealed unto those whose hearts are set upon them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.10. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. <hi>ver.</hi> 11.

<q>When the Virgins, not only foolish, but wise also are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleep; this is a sign that the Mystery of God shall be finished ere long, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.5, 6. whilst the Bridegroom tarryed, they all slumbred and slept, and at midnight there was a cry made, behold, the Bridegroom cometh:</q>
So then, when the wise
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:000143_0103_0FA263735E9A1B40"/>
Virgins are asleep, amongst the rest, this is a sign that Jesus Christ is coming (not to the ultimate judgment, but) as a Bridegroom. This is a sign that the great <hi>and blessed Nuptials</hi> draw on apace, concerning which Christ spake at the Institution of the Lords Supper, saying,
<q>I will drink no more of the fruit of the Vine until that day that I drink it new <hi>i. e.</hi> not corporally, but after a spiritual and new kind of manner, <hi>in the kingdom of God, Mark</hi> 14.25.</q>
Consider also <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.6, 7.
<q>There was the voice of a great multitude, saying, <hi>Allelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah,</hi> the Lord God omnipotent reigneth, the Marriage of the Lamb is come, and his Wife hath made her self <hi>ready</hi>:</q>
When once the <hi>Iews</hi> are converted, then will this voice be heard; then will the Lambs Wife be made ready for the Marriage. Now I say, the fore-going sign of this, is sleeping amongst the Virgins. And alas is it not so now? Are not all the Virgins asleep? what else meaneth that strange spirit of worldliness that possesseth and prevaileth upon great Professors? <hi>Lamentable!</hi> Professors are ready to comply with any thing, though it be to the straining of their consciences; what say they? <hi>we must be wise, we must be wise:</hi> and though the wisdom of the Serpent, devoures the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency of the Dove, they care not. <hi>Any thing to save an estate</hi>; what though the men we have to do withal be the enemies of God, and of his Saints, yet say they, <hi>Let us comply as far as ever we can.</hi> I do declare unto you, that, the Lord Jesus is coming to shake men out of these slumbers. Is it now a time to use base compliances, to save an Estate, when all mens Estates are going to wrack and ruine? Now must you needs have great things for

There shall such a day as this come upon the earth, even a day wherein the Nations shall learn War no more; but before this day there must be terrible doings and desolations made upon the earth, as a sign of that glorious tranquillity, which the most high (whose method of divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, is to bring light out of darkness, good out of evil, order out of confusion, peace out of war) will establish on the earth. I may tell you therefore, that <hi>dreadful wars,</hi> confused noise, and garments rolled in bloud, are a sign of Christ's appearing to establish his kingdom on the Earth. I remember <note n="(m)" place="margin">Lactantius <hi>de Divino Praemio</hi> l. 7. c. 19.</note> 
               <hi>Lactantius</hi> (who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the third Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) hath a saying, that before the Lord Jesus come from Heaven to set up his glorious kingdom here below, <hi>there shall a sword fall from heaven to the earth,</hi> whereby the Saints then living (saith he) shall gather courage, as knowing that ere long, their Lord will come to redeem them out of the hands of all that hate them. Now this is come to pass at this day, there is a sword fallen from Heaven to the Earth, the God of Heaven and Earth hath put all the world into a bloudy frame of revenge and war one against another. Therefore let the Saints lift up their heads, and let them know that the Lord <hi>is coming,

            <p>I might also tell you, that direful and astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing desolations by fire, are a sign that the time is at hand wherein the Mystery of God shall be finished. Consider <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.8.

For this is that which discourageth and keeps off many from looking into these Truths, that they think with themselves there's nothing of certainty in these things, all Interpretations of prophetical mysteries are but conjectural, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle speaks of unbelieving prayer, <hi>let not him</hi> that asketh doubting,

<q>It is given unto you to know the Mysteries of the kingdom of heaven.</q>
It was given unto them to understand the Mysteries of the Gospel and kingdom of grace; likewise it was given unto them to understand the Mysterie of the kingdom of the <hi>Messias,</hi> in making all things new, that by the second <hi>Adam</hi> the world might at last be restored unto that glorious conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the which it was created for the first <hi>Adam.</hi> This is a Mystery of the kingdom indeed, which the world understands but little of in truth.

Observe then (my friends, and brethren, beloved in the Lord) and be awakened this day, I say, observe, that when the prayers of Saints ascend before the Throne of God, with the incense of the merits and intercession of the Lord Jesus, there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth upon it <hi>thundrings, voices, lightnings, and an earthquake, Rev.</hi> 8.4, 5. would you then see that <hi>earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake</hi> wherein <hi>the mountains of prey, that devour Israel,</hi>
               <pb n="181" facs="unknown:000143_0115_0FA2637DE745E8C8"/>
shall be brought low, and wherein <hi>the Lords house,</hi> which is now trampled upon, <hi>shall be exalted</hi> on the tops of the mountains? Oh then pray as for your lives <hi>all manner of prayer,</hi> even publick prayer, fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prayer secret prayer; and in all stir up your selves to call upon the Lord, and say,
<q>awake, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, O arm of the Lord as in the days of old; awake, as in the years of ancient generations, that <hi>Sion</hi> may return with singing, and everlasting joy upon her head.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And shall I tell you (yea from the Lord I will tell you) that the prayers of poor despicable ones, that know, and fear, and serve God, can do great things with him that doth even whatsoever he please<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in heaven, and on earth, and in all deep places. Oh consider of it! I remember <hi>Melancthon</hi> (that great and Learned Divine) saith,
<q>he was much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to hope that God would carry on the work of Reformation in <hi>Germany</hi> (and the Lord did carry it on with great success in those days) because he understood that there were many poor godly women, that were wont to meet together to pray that the work of Reformation might go <hi>forward:</hi>
               </q>
Even so if the Lord stir up the hearts of his poor servants to favour the dust of <hi>Sion,</hi> and to shew it by earnest prayer before him at all times, surely the day will not be long before the Lord ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in glory to build up <hi>Sion,</hi> for he will have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the prayer of the destitute, and he will not despise their prayer.
