            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>ELI, the chief of his tribe and prieſt of the temple in Shiloh, was himſelf a pious and good man. He ſeriouſly performed the duties of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and diſcovered a ſolicitude to promote the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of religion. In his own life he ſet a good example, and gave the beſt advice to thoſe who aſſembled around the altar of the Lord; but he fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the government of his family. He trained not his ſons to walk in his ſteps; and to obey the commands of their God. He gave great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er latitude of indulgence to their paſſions and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, than is conſiſtent with the rules of virtue. He did not, with becoming zeal and authority, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the commencement of their evil practices, but connived at their impiety, and they became ſons of Belial. The confidence and the power repoſed in them, as the attendants of the altar, they abuſed to the vileſt purpoſes. Inſtead of leading in the devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:025137_0003_0FCE6966F3147250"/>
of the people, inſtead of pure examples and amiable manners<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to perſuade their countrymen to walk in the paths of religion, they uſed the influence of their ſtation, to corrupt their minds and allure them to the paths of folly and vice. At a late period, Eli warned his ſons of their danger, and admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to reform their practices. "He ſaid unto them, ¿ Why do ye ſuch things? For I hear of your evil doings by all this people. Nay, my ſons; for it is no good report that I hear; ye make the Lord's people to tranſgreſs. If one man ſin againſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, the judge ſhall judge him; but, if a man ſin againſt the Lord, ¿ Who ſhall entreat for him?" But alas! the authority of the parent was loſt, the habit of ſin was eſtabliſhed, admonition and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel were ineffectual. The father himſelf ſuffered for his early neglect in the education of his children. His declining years were rendered joyleſs by the knowledge of their malpractices, and the prophet of the Lord was commiſſioned to carry to him the predictions of the ſignal deſtruction of his ſons, and of the tranſlation of the prieſthood from his family. A ſimilar meſſage was delivered by the youthful Samuel: "I have told him, that I will judge his houſe, for the iniquity which he knoweth; becauſe his ſons made themſelves vile and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained them not." When Eli heard this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine denunciation, he murmured not, but in grief he acquieſced. "It is the Lord; let him do what ſeemeth him good." This afflicted man filled up the full meaſure of his days, he attained to ninety and eight years, his eyes failed through age, his limbs
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:025137_0004_0FCE69A1543D07C0"/>
were almoſt incapable of motion; but he ſtill felt anxiety for the intereſts of his country. The Iſrael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites were at war. His ſons were gone forth to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and the ark of God was conveyed to the field of action. Impatient to hear from the camp, he ſat by the wayſide. Tidings were brought of the defeat of the army, and the city was in an uproar. The tumult reached the ears of the aged prieſt, and with deep anxiety he it daired the cauſe. The meſſenger approached him and ſaid: "I am he that came out of the army, and I fled today out of the army. And he ſaid, ¿ What is there done, my ſon? And the meſſenger ſaid, Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael is fled before the Philiſtines, and there has been alſo a great ſlaughter among the people, and thy two ſons, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken." A train of horrid ideas crowded upon the mind of the enfeebled prieſt.— The ſlaughter of the people—the accompliſhment of the prophecy againſt his own houſe—and the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the ark. The ſhock was more than he could bear. He fell backward from his ſeat, and by the fall he parted with his life and his troubles.</p>
            <p>The words before us I have choſen, as a ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble theme for a diſcourſe, on the preſent ſolemn and painful occaſion. I have choſen them with a view to illuſtrate the importance, and enforce the duty, of a religious education.</p>
            <p>The duties of parents towards their children is one of the moſt ſacred truſts, which the Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernour of the world has imparted to man. Throughout the animal creation God has implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:025137_0005_0FCE6968797BE970"/>
thoſe inſtincts, which direct all claſſes to the care of their progeny, and lead them in the moſt effectual manner, to aid their progreſs to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity of their natures. But man, poſſeſſing a nobler capacity, is in this, as in all other important con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, left to the voluntary and free exerciſe of his powers; and his children are dependent upon his affection, wiſdom and providence.</p>
            <p>In whatever view we contemplate the education of our children, we ſhall all be deeply impreſſed with a ſenſe of its importance. If we attend to the influence that moral principles and early hab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its of ſobriety may have, in the preſent world, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on maturer years and future practices, this conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration alone is ſufficient to inſpire us with the higheſt ſolicitude, to give the tender mind a virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous direction, and to eſtabliſh thoſe moral princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, which, under all the conditions of human life, are the beſt ſecurity for good conduct. How great are the temptations, to which youth are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed! How many fall victims to the deceitful al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements of vice! How many deſtroy their health by intemperance, and render their lives uſeleſs by diſſipation! How many, whoſe declining years are imbittered by reflections on their youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful folly and extravagance! ¿ Shall we not all then feel compaſſion and concern for thoſe, who are ſoon to enter on this dangerous period, and whoſe worldly proſperity, or preſent miſery, greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the bias that ſhall at firſt be given to the mind, and the courſes that in early life may be adopted?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:025137_0006_0FCE69A2DD943C30"/>Nor ſhall we think the buſineſs of education leſs important, if we attend to its influence on ſociety. Wiſe men in every age, have ſubſcribed to the truth of Solomon's maxim: "Righteouſneſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alteth a nation, but ſin is the reproach of any peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple." The moral virtues are of the higheſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to the intereſt of civil ſociety. We are told that they are more eſpecially neceſſary to the ſupport of a government like ours. In the ſame degree, therefore, that early impreſſions of virtue, and good moral principles, are ſalutary to individ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uals are they important to the community. The proſpects of the next generation, the ſucceſs of thoſe liberal meaſures in government and religion, which we have adopted, and in which every good man feels himſelf intereſted, depend in a great degree on the general practices of the youth of the preſent day. We cannot then do our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try more eſſential ſervice, than, in our ſeveral ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to uſe our beſt endeavours to form the minds of our children to moral goodneſs, and to train them to the love and practice of thoſe virtues, which will make them valuable and uſeful members of ſociety.</p>
            <p>Or, ſhould we extend our views to the future and everlaſting happineſs of the objects of our preſent attention, we ſhall ſtill, in a greater degree, be concerned for their good education. It is eaſier to <hi>prevent</hi> than to <hi>cure</hi> habits of vice. If they, who convert ſinners from the error of their ways, have the ſatisfaction to reflect, that they have delivered the ſouls of their fellow beings from death, <hi>they</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:025137_0007_0FCE6969F49A4730"/>
cannot feel leſs ſatisfaction, who, by good inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and example, ſecure youth from vice and thereby prevent them from feeling the preſent and future evils of ſin. Of the future practices of men we cannot, indeed, have an abſolute certainty; but the good education of the child, and the virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous habits of the youth, afford the greateſt poſſible ſecurity for the religious improvement of the man.</p>
            <p>All the motives, that can have influence to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade men to perform that branch of parental duty under conſideration, may with their full force be preſented to our minds. With us there are no envious diſtinctions of orders. None are born to hereditary rights. The path to eminence and to the honourary diſtinctions of ſociety is open to every individual; and all deſcriptions of men poſſeſs the means to give their children ſuch education, as may qualify them to be uſeful and diſtinguiſhed members of the community. Our anceſtors, in the firſt ſettlement of this country, were ſenſible of the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of education, and were early attentive to the beſt means to ſecure it. Their ſituation inſpired them with liberal and ſublime ideas on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and they adopted a plan, from which we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the moſt extenſive advantages. Removed from the means of inſtruction and improvement, which they enjoyed in their mother country, and forming a world by themſelves, they felt the inconveniences of their ſituation, and foreſaw that, without pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar exertions, the ſucceeding generation would but little differ from the tribes of ſavages with which they muſt aſſociate. They therefore eſtabliſhed a
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:025137_0008_0FCE69A434446EA0"/>
method of general education by legiſlative authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. They made it the duty of every incorporation, which poſſeſſed the ability, to eſtabliſh ſchools at the common expenſe, open as much to the children of the poor as to thoſe of the rich. The method has been preſerved to the preſent day: And New-england, I believe, is now the only country on the globe, where the education of children is ſo much the care of government, as to oblige the wealthy, in proportion to their property, to bear the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe of ſchools, of which all may reap an equal advantage.</p>
            <p>The general utility of this plan has been fully realized. The great body of the community, at the preſent day, diſcover a laudable ſpirit to carry into effect the free intentions of the legiſlature. The opportunities, to qualify youth for the active buſineſs of ſociety, are great; and we have only to lament the inattention and negligence of individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als to avail themſelves of the means put within their reach, to prepare their children to ſuſtain, with honour and emolument, the various offices of ſociety.</p>
            <p>But among us, ¿ Can there be thoſe, who are ſo far loſt to parental feelings, as not to wiſh to fit their children for ſtations, that are not menial and ſervile? Look into ſociety. ¿ Who are the men, that fill with the greateſt dignity and luſtre the various offices of government?—¿ Who riſe to the moſt diſtinguiſhed eminence in the ſeveral learned profeſſions?—¿ Who manage with the greateſt ſucceſs the means to acquire property?—¿ Are
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:025137_0009_0FCE696C0663F0C8"/>
they generally thoſe, who enter into life with pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar advantages of family, or with proſpects of large patrimonial eſtates? Or, ¿ Are they men, who were early taught to depend on the energies of their own minds, and were educated under the perſuaſion, that their characters and ſtations in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety were ſuſpended on their own exertions? The anſwer to theſe queſtions will tend to extinguiſh in the wealthy and eminent the pride and vanity of family, and to raiſe the poor and the humble from meanneſs and deſpondency. It will point parental ſolicitude to its proper objects, and teach us all, that a good education, that habits of ſobriety and uſeful application, are the beſt inheritance we can tranſmit to our children.</p>
            <p>But, on this occaſion, I wiſh to direct your at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention more particularly to a <hi>religious</hi> education. Religion adds worth to all other accompliſhments. Without it the higheſt attainments in literature, the moſt poliſhed forms of addreſs, and all the arts of buſineſs, lay no foundation for confidence—give no ſecurity for amiable and good conduct. Relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion alone refines the diſpoſitions of men, ennobles their views, eſtabliſhes unchangeable principles of good conduct, and furniſhes the moſt influential motives to perform all ſocial, all benevolent and honourable offices. Religion is as much ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to worldly accompliſhments, as the immortal ſoul is ſuperiour to the corruptible body—as ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting happineſs is preferable to the momentary diſtinctions of wealth and grandeur. It is a ſenſe of the ſuperintendence of Deity, "whoſe eyes ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:025137_0010_0FCE37C553130A98"/>

            <p>How unhappy then the condition of thoſe, who were led to profane the name of God, before they attained to an age to form any worthy apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the perfection and majeſty of Deity! Who were induced to make a jeſt of the ſolemnities of religion, before they had underſtanding to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend its duties, or to feel the force of its obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations! ¿ What ſhall check the corrupt indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of their paſſions?—¿ What ſhall reſtrain them from the greateſt enormities?—¿ Will they not adopt the language of the practical atheiſts of old, "¿ Who is the Lord that we ſhould fear him, and what profit ſhall we have, if we pray unto him?"</p>
            <p>Early impreſſions are deep; they are influential. We are all ſenſible of the influence of principles, that were implanted in our minds before reaſon had attained its ſtrength. We are all ſenſible with what difficulty we conquer the influence of opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions and perſuaſions that, through falſe methods of education, were impreſſed upon our infant minds. We may be fully convinced of their ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious origin; and yet with all the ſtrength of ſound reaſon and mature judgment, we cannot wholly eradicate their influence. ¿ What ſalutary effects then, may not be expected from early im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions

of piety, and right moral principles of action, which will receive increaſing ſtrength and ſupport from the deciſions of a ſound judgment, the dictates of an enlightened conſcience, and from every habit of juſt reflection? There is a proſpect, that ſome youth, who have been favoured with a religious education, may be led aſtray by the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of their diſpoſitions, or by the enticements of their lewd and corrupt companions. Yet they ſin with fear and trembling. They ſhudder at every ſudden alarm, as though the avenging miniſter of heaven was approaching to arreſt them in their progreſs of impiety, and puniſh their folly and ſin. Or ſhould they even form a <hi>habit</hi> of ſin, unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed occurrences of divine Providence may awaken them to a keen ſenſe of their guilt, call up the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of more innocent days, and render them alive to all the feelings of religion and virtue. But where the mind has never been impreſſed with a ſenſe of religion, where moral principles have nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er been implanted, conſcience, by an early ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with ſin, will be ſilenced before its voice has been diſtinctly heard, and the moſt aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned ſtate of vice will probably be the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. Look among thoſe, whoſe firſt impreſſions were made amidſt ſcenes of vice, and who received their education under examples of ſin, whoſe firſt eſſays of reaſon and activity were amidſt ſcenes of corruption and profligacy, and you will find de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of youthful depravity, at which you muſt be aſtoniſhed; and the recovery of youth, of this

            <p>The parent would be juſtly accounted ſavage and inhuman, who ſhould abandon his child in its infant ſtate, or make no proviſion for its ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and comfort in the period of childhood and youth. He would be thought unworthy the name of a father, and a diſgrace to his ſpecies, who ſhould turn his ſon into the world, at the age of manhood, without any acquaintance with the active buſineſs of life, and deſtitute of all means to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an honeſt and reputable ſupport. ¿What then muſt be the character of the man, who is inatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the <hi>religious</hi> and <hi>virtuous</hi> education of his children; who takes no pains to teach them wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy apprehenſions of the being and government of God; who neglects to impreſs their minds with a reverence of the divine character; and to lead them to a realizing view of the obligations and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal concerns of religion? The man, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lives in the exiſtence of a God, who ſuppoſes that his child poſſeſſes a capacity above the brute that periſhes, and yet neglects, to lead him to a right knowledge of the great truths and duties of religion, muſt be dead to the true affection of a parent, loſt to the moſt ingenuous feelings of humanity, and altogether deſtitute of a becoming ſolicitude for the welfare and happineſs of the "fruit of his body." ¿ Does not ſuch neglect ſhock all our feelings of tenderneſs and ſympathy?—¿ Is it not inconſiſtent with every dictate of reaſon, and the groſſeſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the precepts of our religion?</p>

In general we may obſerve, that the authority of the parent ought not to be exerciſed with ſuch ſeverity, as to damp the ardor of emulation, and beget a weak and ſervile dependence. Children ſhould be led to place confidence in their own exertions.

In religion, unreaſonable reſtraints ſhould not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; for theſe have a tendency to prejudice young minds againſt religious duty. Offices of piety, and the general practices of virtue, ought not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in a gloomy and forbidding aſpect; leſt averſion be excited in the unexperienced mind. Deity ſhould ever be deſcribed to children, as a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent and merciful father, as well as a juſt and righteous judge, that his ſervice may appear eaſy and pleaſant. Youth ſhould be led to hate vice on account of its odious nature and baneful effects, and to prize religious attainments, as qualifications neceſſary to ſecure them peace of mind, real digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of character, ſubſtantial and laſting happineſs. Permit me to add, that inſtruction muſt always be enforced by example. Principle will generally be underſtood, as illuſtrated by practice.</p>

               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:025137_0015_0FCE69767743FAD0"/>The ſtory, of which our text is a part, opens to our contemplation an inſtance of the fatal effects attendant on the neglect of parents to reſtrain the vicious propenſities of their children, and to give a virtuous direction to their active powers.</p>
            <p>The ſons of Eli made themſelves vile in the ſight of God. They broke looſe from all the reſtraints of religion, and "gave themſelves up to work iniq<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity with greedineſs." Their guilt was, in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, imputed to their father, becauſe he did not, with the earneſtneſs and authority of a parent, check their vicious diſpoſitions, and reſtrain their violent practices. In that period of human life, which needs all the conſolation of religion, all the ſooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing attention of <hi>filial</hi> piety, to enable a man to ſupport its infirmities and pains, he doubtleſs felt all that remorſe, which an ingenuous mind feels upon the conſciouſneſs of criminal neglect, in one of the moſt ſacred and important duties of man. He ſaw his ſons fall from the dignity and purity of their natures. He ſaw them the diſgrace of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotal order, and beheld them the agents of ſin, in the wilful and baſe corruption of thoſe who preſented themſelves for the ſincere worſhip of the Deity. He felt the ſevere and juſt reprimand of his God, and was humbled by the divine declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the prieſthood, in his age, the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed honour of his country, ſhould forever be removed from his family.</p>
            <p>¿ And have we not now before us a ſtriking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the fatal effects of the neglect of early education and good example? We behold a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

man being, apparently devoid of ſocial affection and a ſenſe of moral obligation. He has commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted crimes of the moſt heinous nature, and is now with ignominy to loſe his life, as a peſt of ſociety; and yet he diſcovers little or no compunction of mind, little commotion on account of the dreadful ſcenes before him. ¿Has the Author of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture denied him thoſe powers and affections, which men in common poſſeſs? All who are particularly acquainted with him, teſtify that he poſſeſſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual faculties to diſtinguiſh right from wrong, to comprehend the nature of moral duty, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the force of moral obligation. He cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly poſſeſſes ſome qualities that are manly and noble. Many of the cauſes, that more frequently are the introduction to the crime which he has committed, had no operation upon him. He never mixed in thoſe ſcenes of intemperance and diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which frequently corrupt the moral powers of men, and prepare the way for ſins of a crimſon die. In his depravity, the temptations of ambition and avarice had no influence; yet in a country, where all men enjoy thoſe advantages for moral and religious improvement, of which we have made general mention, we behold him a ſavage, poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the moſt malignant and revengeful paſſions. ¿To what cauſe ſhall we attribute his diſſocial, his cruel and malignant diſpoſition? For an anſwer to our queſtion we are led to the early period of his exiſtence.</p>

off the ſtage of action, is an unpleaſant taſk. Unneceſſarily to wound the feelings of the living by the relation of the crimes of their deceaſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, is cruel and inhuman. But, if the aſhes of the dead can be made to read lectures of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and virtue to the living; if we can, in ſuch a manner, place the neglects and faults of the deceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before the eyes of the living, as to guard them againſt thoſe miſtakes and dangers, by which oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers fell, propriety may countenance the action.</p>
            <p>From the beſt information I can obtain, I am conſtrained to ſay, that the father of this unhappy man was greatly deficient in the example he ſet before his houſehold, and in the inſtruction he gave to his children. The diſpoſition of this man, when <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

He did not receive thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions and admonitions, which, as the powers Of reaſon expand, impreſs the mind with a ſenſe of the Supreme Being, beget attention to the ſerious truths of religion, and give conſcience a power over the paſſions and inferior deſires. In the daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſes of the family, he ſaw not that example of love and condeſcenſion, of tenderneſs and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, which enforces good inſtruction, ſoftens the paſſions of reſentment and revenge, and inſenſibly forms the diſpoſition to mildneſs, ſympathy and humanity. But the example ſet before him was impious, cruel, and barbarous. In this ſchool the ſon was but too ready to learn. All the rough, malignant, and revengeful paſſions, acquired

ſtrength, and obtained an habitual control of the mind. Amid their violent demands, the ſtill voice of conſcience is not heard. The moſt ſacred re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints of religion are diſregarded. He takes the life of man without emotions of ſympathy, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, or compunction. And, in a ſituation that, we ſhould ſuppoſe, muſt overwhelm the human ſoul with diſtreſs and horror, we ſee him inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſtupid. ¿ Is it not highly probable, that his preſent inſenſibility ariſes from the want of early education?</p>
            <p>¿ Shall not his condition inſpire every parent preſent with the higheſt ſolicitude, faithfully to perform thoſe important duties, which are incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent upon them towards their children? To this, every conſideration that can enter the human mind, urges with irreſiſtible force. ¿ Can there be ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, like the ſorrow of the parent, who ſees his child in the ſituation of this man? But, if he be convinced by his own reflections, that this ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be imputed to his own neglect, How pungent muſt be the remorſe of his conſcience! ¿ What parent could ſee his ſon fallen from virtue and uſefulneſs, numbered with infamous tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, and brought to an untimely and ignominious end?

God, and to diſregard all the reſtraints of religion. In the days of my innocence, I looked up to your example, and by it I was led into the paths of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance and vice. You took no care, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion and parental authority, to correct the irreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular ſallies of paſſion, and to reſtrain me in the commencement of my vicious courſe. You took no pains to lead me to the knowledge of the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter and government of God, and to impreſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my mind the infinite concerns of immortality.

Yet, O horror of ſoul! I have not a heart to exerciſe godly ſorrow for my ſins, and, with the feelings of piety, to implore the mercy of God, through the Saviour of the world.</p>
            <p>Should this man carry his views forward to the final conſequences of impenitent tranſgreſſion, and realize the account he himſelf muſt render at the bar of God, I am unable to paint the remorſe and anguiſh that muſt fill his ſoul.</p>

¿ Are we dogs, that we ſhould do this thing? We believe you incapable of the crime of murder: The human mind does not paſs, at once, to the more heinous deeds of ſin. The advance is gradual. At preſent, you are in more danger from the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſhades of vice, which are leſs noticed, but which are often the introduction to great ſins.

If you once al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low any ſin, however ſmall, to gain an habitual influence over your minds, the fear of ſhame will be leſſened, the force of conſcience diminiſhed, and the reſtraints of virtue weakened; and, in time, you may be led to commit the moſt atrocious ſins with unbluſhing impudence.</p>
            <p>The path of honour and diſtinction in this world lies before you, to animate your minds to virtuous purſuits; and immortal glory and felicity are prepared by the Son of God to reward your piety and goodneſs. Reverence then yourſelves, and aſpire to the true dignity of your natures. Avoid thoſe ſcenes of intemperance and licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which inflame the paſſions, corrupt the beſt powers of the human mind, and are frequently the occaſion of groſs and habitual ſins.</p>
            <p>Reſtrain the paſſion of anger, and never let looſe the ſpirit of revenge; leſt, in the ſatisfaction of ſuppoſed injuries, you ſhould be led into deeds of injuſtice, cruelty, and irreparable miſchief.</p>

You are to be taken away from among the living, becauſe you have made yourſelf vile, and are become unworthy longer to be a member of the community. Your life and liberty are dang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous to the peace of ſociety, dangerous to the lives and liberties of your fellow citizens. You are not on earth, puniſhed as a ſinner againſt God; nor do your ſufferings, from the deciſions of human judicatures, cancel your offences committed againſt Heaven. "Be not deceived; God is not mocked." At the tribunal of heaven you muſt account for every action of your life. Your ſins, with all their aggravations, are known to God. He can never be deceived, flattered, or diverted from his juſt and wiſe purpoſes. All his creatures are in his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and he diſpoſes of them, as to him it ſeemeth beſt.
