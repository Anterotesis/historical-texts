            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE intention of this publication is to diſſeminate the TRUTH of the EVERLASTING GOSPEL, in its rich variety of doctrine, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, experience and hiſtory, both by proſe and verſe, in a manner calculated to gratify the more ſublime taſte, and to inſtruct the plaineſt capacity. In a day of diſſipation, infidelity and error, like the preſent, when, by precept and example, our youth, of every deſcription, are induſtriouſly prejudiced againſt the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of REVELATION; and while many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of religion ſtart aſide into <hi>new paths,</hi> too many efforts, in every agreeable form, cannot be made to defend the truths of PRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MITIVE CHRISTIANITY, and to lead the ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enquirer to taſte its ſacred ſtreams which
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:031228_0004_0FEB733345BF5BF8"/>
lead him to God, refine his ſoul, regulate his life, ſupport him under ſufferings, and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate his hope in proſpect of a bliſsful immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality!</p>
            <p>How far the efforts of the EDITOR of the <hi>Chriſtian's Pocket Library</hi> may have anſwered theſe purpoſes, he leaves with God, and the public. It is, however, with greatful plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure he reviews the long liſt of reſpectable SUBSCRIBERS to this WORK, and from thence preſumes his labours have not been unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, nor in vain. Thus prompted, he ventures, under the ſmiles of IMMANUEL, and the farther encouragement of his pious READ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ERS, upon the publication of another volume.</p>

            <p>IN the centre is a figure of JESUS CHRIST, our ADORABLE SAVIOUR, accompanied by MERCY and JUSTICE.</p>
            <p>JUSTICE, in her left hand, poiſes a pair of ſcales: one of which contains the two tables of the MORAL LAW;—the other a BUBBLE, emblematical of man in his fallen ſtate. The latter, being weighed in the balance, is <hi>found wanting.</hi> JUSTICE re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives from CHRIST a Croſs, repreſenting his own SACRIFICE. This ſhe accepts, and by her inverted SWORD, pronounces ſatisfactory.</p>
            <p>MERCY, on the right hand of our SAVIOUR, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives from him an <hi>Olive-branch,</hi> the well known emblem of PEACE, and a ſure pledge of his love to ſinners, to be publiſhed among all nations.</p>

SIN contaminated the heart;—by ſin the delightful vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of God in Nature was loſt;—man became alienated from the life of God, and expoſed to all the miſeries incurred by reiterated tranſgreſſion. Reduced to ſuch a maſs of depravity and guilt, no wonder that man miſtake the true nature, object, and means of happineſs! As by the carnal prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of the heart objects are ſelected and embrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which promiſe that ſort of felicity which is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>As theſe reflections on human nature are too true to admit of controverſy, it may not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to aſk, "What, in man's preſent ſtate, can reſtore to him that happineſs which the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious powers of his ſoul are capable of enjoying?"

illuminated, and his paſſions refined; as a traveller through the thorny path of life, he needs ſome thing adequate to ſupport him, and bring his mind into acquieſcence with his lot; as a creature im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, and haſtening to a future ſtate, he muſt have aſſurance that after death he ſhall be tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the boſom of JEHOVAH, where alone, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, undiſturbed happineſs reigns. Where then can theſe bleſſings be obtained? Go, ſearch the volumes of Nature,—alas! not a line in her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive page can aſſure a ſinner there are pardons with his JUDGE. Go, paſs through all the ſcenes of diſſipation, honor, wealth, with all the world calls good and great, and ſee if a balm can be procured adequate to heal the guilty conſcience, or meliorate the heart. Here Nature herſelf becomes dumb, and the ſeats of royalty are found the very regions of anxiety, diſappointment and pain. Turn then to the volume of REVELATION; there learn that to reſtore human happineſs God freely gave his BELOVED SON to ſuſtain that weight of <hi>miſery</hi> we incurred by our ſin; that <hi>he who knew no ſin, was made ſin for us, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him.</hi> 2 Cor. v.21. <hi>Though he was rich, for our ſake he became poor, that we through his poverty might be rich.</hi> 2 Cor. viii.9.

death, and triumphant reſurrection, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from his union with the DEITY, he did not make our happineſs poſſible, but <hi>actually</hi> obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. Heb. ix.11, 12. In Jeſus is depoſited all that grace which our depraved nature can demand, to reſtore its felicity.

               <p>THE judgment we deplore is one of the ſwifteſt and moſt tremendous calamities that can fall upon a people: It evidently is "<hi>The Lord's voice to the city,</hi>" and demands our ſolemn attention. Surely there was a cauſe—"<hi>God doth not willingly afflict the children of men.</hi>" This city was growing in opulence, and indulged with every privilege, civil and religious, which could conſtitute our happineſs. Let us then aſk if our gratitude has been propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate to our obligation? It is with extreme re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret we review the too many inſtances of pride, luxury, diſcontent, avarice, and diſſipation, which have increaſed with our years. Who but muſt drop a tear on recollecting the aſtoniſhing growth of infidelity, and the many attempts to traduce the perſon and goſpel of the Son of God, by whom alone we can be ſaved! and it is with ſtill greater ſenſibility we behold the extreme indifference paid
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:031228_0012_0FEB734D00520FD0"/>
by profeſſors to the life, power and proſperity of the pure primitive truth and worſhip of chriſtianity! Thus, <hi>Becauſe iniquity abounds the love of many waxeth cold.</hi> Matt. xxiv.13. That this hath long been the unhappy ſtate of our city, many, many of the more ſerious of different religious denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations have acknowledged with grief. God could not behold us without ſome tokens of his diſpleaſure. On the 20th of September, 1793, our inhabitants fled to the ſanctuary to implore the Divine protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from a ſevere judgment which then pervaded a neighbouring city, and threatened our borders;— then did every heart tremble, and every eye flow with tears: <hi>but the Lord was intreated for the land, the plague was ſtayed,</hi> and we were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. 2 Sam. xxiv.25. That the ſight of this chaſtiſing rod did not produce its deſired effect, is evident by our Lord's laying upon us his ſeverer hand. He commiſſioned not a foe againſt us which could have been driven from our borders by force of arms, but
<q>
                     <l>"—A victor, whose unbounded force</l>
                     <l>"O'er bulwarks breaks with unresisted course;</l>
                     <l>"A thousand ways the swift <hi>contagion</hi> takes,</l>

                     <l>"The winds, infected with the deadly breath,</l>

                  <pb n="8" facs="unknown:031228_0013_0FEB734E8C1765E0"/>
Many, with ſwift precipitation, fled from their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations, while the horrors of death ſat on the brow of thoſe who were left behind. Slow, yet ſteady to his purpoſe, the foe advanced; and, oh! who is competent to deſcribe his awful ſpoils? Blooming youths, once the joy of their parents, and the hope of their country, cut down and lodged in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of corruption! How many perſons of the moſt brilliant parts were arreſted by the polluting hand of Peſtilence, and the public forever deprived of their uſeful virtues! The parent, how ſhall I ſpeak it! the tender parent, not only called to mourn over his departed babe, but compelled, by the law of ſelf-preſervation, to fly from the putrid corpſe of <hi>her</hi> who once lay in his boſom with delight!— Dictated by humanity in relieving others by every kind office in their power, how many

               <p>O Lord, ſurely thou art known by the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which thou executeth. May it never be ſaid of us, "This people turneth not to him that ſmiteth them, neither do they ſeek the Lord of Hoſts." Iſa. ix.13. Although our affliction has been great,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:031228_0014_0FEB7354DF54B4C8"/>
and never to be forgotten, yet, neither ſo great as we juſtly merited, nor as Philadelphia experienc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Let us remember if this viſitation leaves us without ſalutary effects, God hath ſtill more ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows in his quiver, more keenly pointed, and more ſwift in flight. In the year 79 three cities were deſtroyed by an earthquake in <hi>Cyprus.</hi> In 1456, by the ſame meſſenger of juſtice, 40,000 people were loſt in <hi>Naples.</hi> And, in 1665, there died of the plague, in <hi>London,</hi> 68,600 inhabitants. Iſaiah, when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> were inſenſible of the judgments of God upon them, declared, <hi>Thou ſhalt be viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Lord of Hoſts with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noiſe; with ſtorm and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, and the flame of devouring fire.</hi> Iſa. xxix.6. Who will not fear before this great and terrible JEHOVAH! Let us, therefore, inceſſantly pray, that this ſevere judgment may be ſucceeded by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious ſhowers of the richeſt grace! that magiſtrates may rule in the fear of the Almighty; miniſters preach with additional zeal; our congregations walk more ſenſibly in the light of the Lord, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes be converted unto our God!

                  </gap>n, Baron, Lieutenant-General of the Saxon troops, in the ſervice of the King of France. He was born of an ancient and noble family, in Sileſia, April 10, 1710, ſo that it was juſt on his birth-day that he received his wound. He was of equal abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities as a miniſter in the cloſet, and a general in the field: In his younger years he had gone through a regular courſe of ſtudy in the univerſity, and made a great proficiency in philoſophy, eſpecially in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematics; afterwards he ſtudied polemic divinity, till he reaſoned himſelf into an infidel.</p>
               <p>During his illneſs, he ſhewed not the leaſt deſire for pious company, or ſerious diſcourſe, till the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon let his valet-de-chambre know that he could not live long. The man then aſked his maſter whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he did not chuſe to be viſited by a clergyman? He anſwered with warmth, I ſhall not trouble thoſe gentlemen; I know well myſelf what to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and do. His man, not diſcouraged, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thus, My lord, have you ever found me want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in my duty, all the time I have been in your ſervice? He anſwered, No. Then, replied he, I will not be wanting now; the ſurgeons count you paſt recovery, but every one is afraid to tell you ſo; you ſtand on the brink of eternity; pray, Sir, order a clergyman to be called. He pauſed a little,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:031228_0022_0FEB736B6F8A2698"/>
but ſoon gave his hand to the ſervant, thanked him for his honeſty, and ordered him to ſend for me.</p>
               <p>When I came, the man plainly told me the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral was a profeſſed infidel. I went in, and, after a ſhort compliment, ſaid, I am told, my lord, your life is near an end, therefore I preſume, without any more ceremony, to aſk you one plain queſtion: Is the ſtate of your ſoul ſuch, that you can enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a ſolid hope of ſalvation? He anſwered, Yes. On what do you ground this hope? He replied, I never committed any wilful ſin; I have been liable to frailties; but I truſt in God's mercy, and the merits of his Son, that he will have mercy upon me. Theſe words he uttered very ſlowly, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the merits of his Son. I made the following reply: I am apt to believe you are not tainted with the groſſeſt vices, but I fear you a little too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly boaſt of never having committed wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſin; if you would be ſaved, you muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge your being utterly corrupted by ſin, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently deſerving the curſe of God, and eternal damnation. As to your hoping for God's mercy through the merits of his Son, I beg leave to aſk you, Do you believe God has a Son—that his Son aſſumed our nature, in order to be our Saviour— that in the execution of his office he has given am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſatisfaction for us, and recovered our title to

                  </gap> more minute deſcription of the ſtate of my ſoul; let me tell you. Doctor, I have ſome knowledge of philoſophy, by which I have choſen for myſelf a way of ſalvation: I have always endeavored to live a ſober life, to the uttermoſt of my power, not doubting but the Being of all beings would then graciouſly accept me. In this way I ſtood in need of Chriſt, and therefore did not believe on him; but if I take the ſcripture to be a divine revelation, this way of mine I perceive is not the right one; I muſt believe on Chriſt, and through him come to God. I replied, You ſay, <hi>if</hi> you believe the ſcriptures to be a divine revelation. He fetched a deep ſigh, and ſaid, O God! thou wilt make me ſay, <hi>becauſe</hi> I take the ſcripture to be thy word. I ſaid, There are grounds and reaſons enough to determine the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine origin o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I had no ſooner ſpoken theſe words, but, putting off his cap, and lifting up his hands and
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:031228_0024_0FEB7373B33C5D10"/>
eyes, he cried out, O almighty God! I am a poor curſed ſinner, worthy of damnation; but, Lord Jeſus, eternal Son of God, thou diedſt for my ſins alſo, it is through thee alone I can be ſaved. O give me faith, and ſtrengthen that faith! Being extremely weak, he was obliged to ſtop here. A little after he aſked, Is faith enough for ſalvation? Yes, Sir, ſaid I, if it be living faith. Methinks, ſaid he, it is ſo already; I perceive it will be more ſo by and by; let us pray for it.</p>
               <p>Perceiving he was very weak, and to give him ſome reſt, I retired into the next room; but he ſoon ſent to call me. I found him praying, and <hi>Jeſus</hi> was all he prayed for. I reminded him of ſome ſcriptures treating of faith in Chriſt, and he was much delighted with them; indeed he was quite ſwallowed up by the grace of Jeſus, and would hear of nothing but Jeſus Chriſt and him crucified. He cried out, I do not know how it is with me; I never in my life felt ſuch a change; I have power to love Jeſus, and to believe in him, whom I ſo long rejected. O my Jeſus, how merciful art thou to me!</p>
               <p>About noon I ſtept home; but he ſent for me directly; ſo that I could ſcarce eat my dinner. We were both filled with joy, as the partakers of the ſame grace which is in Jeſus; and that in ſuch a
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:031228_0025_0FEB73757B5B7EE0"/>
manner, as if we had been acquainted together for many years.</p>
               <p>Many officers of the army came to ſee him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, to all of whom he talked freely of Jeſus, of the grace of the Father in him, and of the power of the Holy Ghoſt through him; wondering with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceaſing at his having found Jeſus, and at the happy change, by which all things on this ſide eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity were become indifferent to him.</p>
               <p>In the afternoon he deſired to partake of the Lord's ſupper; which he received with a melting, praiſing, and rejoicing heart. All the reſt of the day he continued in the ſame ſtate of ſoul. Towards the evening he deſired, that if his end ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach I w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I was told by his valet, that he ſlept well for ſome hours, and then waking, prayed for a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable time, continually mentioning the name of our Lord, and his moſt precious blood; and that he had deſired ſeveral of the officers to make his converſion known to his court, (that of the king of Poland.) After ſome diſcourſe I aſked, Has your view of Chriſt, and his redemption, been nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

with me as if I had always believed, and never doubted; ſo gracious is the Lord Jeſus to me a ſinner.</p>
               <p>The ſecond day he was unwearied in prayer and exerciſes of faith. Towards evening he ſent for me in haſte. When I came, I found him dying, and in a kind of delirium; ſo I could do no more than give him now and then a word of comfort. I pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed afterward for him, and thoſe that were preſent; ſome of whom were of high birth and rank. I then, by impoſition of hands, as uſual, gave him a bleſſing; which being done, he expired immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately.</p>
               <p>A royal prince who was there (prince Xavier of Saxony) could not forbear weeping; the reſt of the officers bewailed the death of their general, yet praiſed God for having ſhewn ſuch mercy to him.</p>
               <p>I wrote an account of it without delay to his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and had an immediate anſwer. She was a lady of ſeventy-two, of exemplary piety. She praiſed God for his mercy, adding, that he had now anſwered her prayers, which ſhe had never ceaſed to offer on his behalf for eleven years.</p>

                  <head>THE EAGLE.</head>
                  <p>This creature is ſo highly enriched by Nature, and ſo majeſtic in appearance, that the ancients called it <hi>the bird of Heaven</hi>; but moderns have pronounced it <hi>the king of birds.</hi> According to Linnaeus, he is a ſpecies of the ſecond genus called Falco, belonging to the firſt order accipetes, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious. The eagle is of different ſorts, probably only denominated from their colour, and the place of their retreat. That called the golden eagle is moſt eſteemed, being larger and of a more noble appearance than others. His beak is very ſtrong, crooked and ſharp; his head and neck are clothed with narrow ſharp pointed feathers of a deep brown colour, but thoſe on the head, in old age, turn grey. The whole body is of a dark brown, and
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:031228_0029_0FEB7383F7FFFBB8"/>
the feathers of the back are beautifully clouded with a deeper ſhade. The wings, when clothed, reach to the tail, which is of a deep brown, irregularly bar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed, and blotted with an obſcure aſh colour. Every year he moults, and becomes almoſt naked and bald, and then renews its youth by producing a ſet of new feathers. His legs are yellow, ſhort, and very ſtrong, covered with feathers of a dark grey; his toes are coated with ſcales, and armed with the moſt formidable claws. The body may weigh a dozen pounds. From the point of the bill to the tail it meaſures four feet; and between the points of each wing, when extended, near ſix feet. He is a bird of great ſtrength, exceeding bold, and very voracious in ſeizing its prey, which are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally geeſe, cranes, hares, rabbits, lambs, kids, fawns, and ſerpents; but when impelled by hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger will ſeize on much larger animals; and Sir Robert Sibbald aſſures us, that children, when un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attended, have been devoured by them. They ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally quench their thirſt with the blood of their prey; and, after feeding on the fleſh, break the bones to extract the marrow. It is, however, to be obſerved, that this bird, unleſs preſſed with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, will not ſtoop to carrion, and never devours but what he has earned by his own purſuits. The ſight of the eagle is quick, ſtrong, and piercing,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:031228_0030_0FEB7385870BD928"/>
not only diſcovering their prey at an amazing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, but penetrating the rays of the meridian ſun. Angelus, the jeſuit, informs us that the reaſon why the eagle, the fibres of whoſe optic nerves are not ſtronger than thoſe of other animals, is able to face the ſun, and endure its rays, is, that it has two ſets of eye-lids; the one thick and cloſe, and the other thiner and finer, which laſt it draws over the eyes when it looks at any luminous body, and thus breaks the force of its rays. Of all birds the eagle flies the higheſt, even to a proverb. Prov. xxiii.5. It frequents the higheſt mountains, and the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceſſible clifts of the rock; there they generally make their neſt, depoſit their eggs, which are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom more than two. They foſter their young with peculiar affection and care. In a time of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine they are ſaid to feed their young with their own blood, ſooner than ſuffer them to periſh. When danger ſurrounds them, the eagle flutters over the neſt to defend the brood from their enemies, or takes them on its wings and bears them away to a more ſafe retreat. But this bird is moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for its longevity, and its faculty for ſuſtaining a long abſtinence from food. Keyſler relates, that an eagle died at Vienna, after a confinement of an hundred and four years.</p>

                  <p>Thou great Supreme! who hath created every winged fowl after its kind, that they might fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven, at thy command the eagle mounts and maketh her neſt on high; ſhe dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and the ſtrong place; from thence ſhe ſeeketh the prey, and her eyes behold afar off; her young ones alſo ſuck her blood, and where the ſlain are there is ſhe. Gen. i.20, 21. Job xxxix.27—30. While the beaſt of the field, and fowls of the air, praiſe the name of their adored Creator, may I ever em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy my breath in praiſing the name of the Lord, for his name alone is excellent, and his glory is above the earth and heaven!</p>
                  <p>The eagle, with its wings extended, was reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly conſecrated by the Perſians, and afterwards by the Romans, who, in the ſecond year of the conſulate of C.

The Ark and Cherubims, with their apparatus, ordained by God, firſt for the Tabernacle of Moſes, then for the Temple of Solomon, were an exhibition of what had been tranſacted in heaven, and was yet to be completed for man. The mercy-ſeat, to be ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled with atoning blood, was made of pure gold; and of the ſame piece was beaten out two figures, each poſſeſſing four faces, bearing the likeneſs of an ox, a lion, an eagle, and a man, called the Cherubims of Glory; each of them had wings ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, embracing each other; and between theſe Jehovah dwelt, and, by the office of the High Prieſt, communicated his will, and bleſſed the tribes of Iſrael.

Into theſe names, as the portion of the church, all who believe, whether Jew or Gentile, under the goſpel, are baptiſed. Matt. xxviii.19.</p>
                  <p>But, perhaps, as the mercy-ſeat of pure gold, ſprinkled with blood, was a type of Chriſt, whom God hath ſet forth a propitiation for ſin; and as the cherubs were made out of the very ſame maſs of gold with the mercy-ſeat, they may not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be conſidered repreſentatives of the perſonal glories of the ſame Immanuel. The extraordinary eye of the eagle, capable of penetrating the rays of the ſun, and to diſcover its object at ſo remote a diſtance, and his power by flight to aſcend up on high, are no inexpreſſible emblems of the omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and omnipreſence peculiar to the Son of God.

Deut. xxxii.11.</p>
                  <p>As Chriſt and his people are <hi>one,</hi> it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common for the Spirit of inſpiration to expreſs them by the ſame emblem.

How bountiful has the Almighty been in the beſtowment of mental accompliſhments upon you, and from which, as your parent, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate your future uſefulneſs in the world! yet, my child, thoſe who have arrived at the meridian of life know that your ſtage is the moſt critical, important, and dangerous. The latent evils of your heart will now begin to iſſue forth as bitter waters from a corrupted ſpring: the world will unfold to you her deluſive charms, and ten thouſand objects will advance to tempt your feet from the path of honor.—Wipe away that tear which ſtands trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling in your eye; be aſſured, my ſon, had I rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe you would thus depart from virtue, I ſhould be the moſt wretched of fathers. Though hitherto free from thoſe vices to which, alas! too many have been addicted, your breaſt, like all the ſons of men, poſſeſſes thoſe ſeeds of vice which only

                  <p>My father will excuſe my ſenſibility. I weep not for your faithful counſel, but becauſe I have already, in ſome degree, felt the force of thoſe unhappy tempers that would fain diſturb my peace, and pollute my heart.</p>

                  <p>I am glad you begin to feel yourſelf— this is one ſtep towards a cure. You know I have ever taught you to reſpect the Bible, becauſe I have ſufficient evidence to believe it is the mind of God to man. Take that book, my ſon, with a deſign to trace the ſource, the nature, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of that evil your heart ſo bitterly laments. That theſe pages exhibit to me my true likeneſs, as a ſinner, is an evidence of their divine original, which my unbelieving heart, nor all the powers of infidelity, can deſtroy. Remember alſo, that the ſame God who hath delineated the features of fallen nature, muſt give you eyes to ſee and an heart to underſtand.</p>

                  <p>Take pen and paper—I will recite you a few. Gen. viii.21. Eccl. xi.9. Pſa. xiv. Iſa. i. Jer. xvii.9. Ezek. xvi. Mark vii.14—23. to which may be added Gen. vi.5. as that paſſage ſtrikingly explores the evil of the heart. Take time for this work; be not afraid to know the worſt of yourſelf. It is natural to men to live ſtrangers to themſelves, and it requires equal grace from God to irradiate the mind as it does to pardon ſin; your father has known and felt this in his own breaſt, therefore it is that I direct you to the ſame all-glorious fountain, and wiſh ever to teſtify my gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to my God.</p>

               <p>A Society of gentlemen, moſt of them poſſeſſed of a liberal education and poliſhed manners, but who, unhappily, had been ſeduced from a belief of the ſcriptures, uſed to aſſemble alternately in each other's houſes, on the bank of the Tweed, for the purpoſe of ridiculing Revelation, and harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each other in their infidelity. At laſt they unanimouſly formed a reſolution ſolemnly to burn the Bible, and ſo to be troubled no more with a book which was ſo hoſtile to their principles, and diſquieting to their conſciences. The day fixed upon came—a large fire was prepared—a Bible was laid upon the table, and a flowing bowl ſtood ready to drink its dirge. For the execution of their plan, they fixed upon a young gentleman of high birth, brilliant vivacity, and elegance of manners. He undertook the taſk, and, after a few enliven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glaſſes, amidſt the applauſes of his jovial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, he approached the table, took up the Bible, and was walking reſolutely forward to put it in the fire; but, happening to give it a look, all at once he was ſeized with trembling; paleneſs over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread his countenance, and his whole frame ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed convulſed.

                     <l>And all the spider's rage defy'd.</l>

               <p>ON the 26th of September, 1795, died, in the 32d year of his age, of the malignant fever which then prevailed in New-York, the Rev. JACOB BRUSH, one of the Elders of the Methodiſt Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Church. Mr. Bruſh attended Mr. Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, at whoſe houſe he boarded, and who died of the fever; and on the next Lord's-day he preached a ſermon on the occaſion, from Matt. xxv.23. in the new church. Mr. Bruſh, immediately on his return home, was taken ill, languiſhed five days and died, and on the Sabbath following the Rev. Mr. Kingſton preached a ſermon, from Rev. xiv.13. in the ſame pulpit, on the death of Mr. Bruſh.
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:031228_0052_0FEB73CD836648F8"/>
Shall not this event make a ſolemn impreſſion upon ſurviving Miniſters, that they may ſo faithfully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their office as to be ready to go from the pulpit to the tribunal of Jehovah? What is yet remarkable, Mr. Bruſh, in a few days, was to have been married to Miſs E. M.—How ſoon may our moſt pleaſing proſpects be over-caſt, and we torn from the embraces of our friends, and lodged in the chambers of corruption!</p>
               <p>Mr. Bruſh, at an early period of life, became ſeriouſly affected with divine things. After deep diſtreſs for ſin, he obtained faith in Chriſt as his Saviour. He then thought it his duty to preach the Goſpel of that Chriſt who had done ſo much for his ſoul, and in 1785 he was admitted as proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner into the Conferrence of Methodiſt Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. In 1788 he was ordained a <hi>Deacon,</hi> and in 1790 he entered the <hi>Elderſhip.</hi> As a miniſter, he was zealous, wiſe, bold and ſucceſsful; as a chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, devout and circumſpect; and as a friend, ſympathetic, kind and conſtant. In his laſt ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he appeared ſolemnly happy; and, a few hours before his death, he was aſked "Whether he felt happy in God, and had an aſſurance of the divine favour?" To which (by ſigns) he anſwered in the affirmative. The laſt Lord's-day that he preached he appeared to be ſo reſigned to the will
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:031228_0053_0FEB73CF103A2CC0"/>
of God, that ſome of the hearers obſerved, "they never heard him preach with ſo much power before, and that he ſeemed to preach as though it were his laſt."</p>
               <p>Thus was cut off, in the prime of life, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing and uſeful Miniſter of Chriſt, and as highly beloved among the people of his connection.</p>

               <p>JUSTIFICATION is one of the moſt import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant articles of our holy religion, and demands our moſt ſolemn attention. Brevity and perſpicuity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our aim in preparing this paper, we ſhall—ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain

the <hi>term</hi>—conſider the <hi>author</hi>—the <hi>objects</hi> intereſted—the <hi>bleſſings</hi> reſulting.</p>
               <p>We are, I. To explain the term. Juſtification, ſpiritually or evangelically conſidered, is a complete acquittal from imputed and contracted guilt; a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from the condemning power of ſin; an act of free grace flowing from Jehovah's ſovereign good will and pleaſure. By many eminent divines this leading doctrine is conſidered as twofold — ETERNAL and DECLARATIVE. By the <hi>former,</hi> we underſtand that which exiſted in the divine mind from everlaſting, reſpecting the choſen ſeed, united with Chriſt their head, "who hath ſaved us, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own purpoſe and grace, which was given us in Chriſt Jeſus, before the world began." 2 Tim. i.9. By the <hi>latter,</hi> viz. declarative juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, is deſigned <hi>that</hi> which, in time, takes place in or on the conſcience of a believer, commonly ſtiled <hi>juſtification by or through faith.</hi> It is upon <hi>this</hi> we now addreſs you. To be <hi>thus</hi> fully abſolved from all ſin and guilt, by virtue of Chriſt's plenary ſatisfaction, and pronounced "heirs of eternal life," oh, how enlivening the thought! how animating the reflection! "Bleſs the Lord, O our ſouls, and all that is within us, bleſs his holy name."</p>
               <p>We come, II. to conſider the author of our juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. "It is God who juſtifieth." Rom. viii.33.
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:031228_0056_0FEB73DA5A3D9338"/>
A Triune God, Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt. A truth this, when viewed in all its parts, calculated to excite not only within <hi>us,</hi> but amid the angelic choir the higheſt wonder, "which things the angels deſire to look into." 1 Pet. i.12. "Whom GOD hath ſet forth to be a propitiation, through faith in his blood, to declare his righteouſneſs for the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins that are paſt, through the Forbearance of God; to declare, I ſay, at this time his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; that <hi>he</hi> might be juſt, and the juſtifier of him who believeth in Jeſus. Rom. x.25, 26. "Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſins; and by HIM all that believe are juſtified from all things, from which ye could not be juſtified by the law of Moſes." Acts xiii.38, 39. "And ſuch were ſome of you; but ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified, but ye are juſtified, in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the SPIRIT of our God." 1 Cor. vi.11. Many other pertinent texts might be quo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed; but permit us, previous to our diſmiſſion of this head, to mention, with all due conciſeneſs, a few of the cauſes of our being thus <hi>juſtified</hi> or pronounced RIGHTEOUS. "The works of the Lord are great, ſought out of all them who have pleaſure <hi>therein,</hi>" is of equal force now as when penned by Iſrael's king. Thus ſupported, we will not be backward in aſſerting—</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="52" facs="unknown:031228_0057_0FEB73DC0327B570"/>1ſt. That <hi>from</hi> this main pillar, this Sublime Characteriſtic of goſpel truth, <hi>man's obedience to a law of works</hi> is to be utterly excluded. Paul peremptorily ſays, "By the deeds of the law no fleſh ſhall be juſtified in his ſight." Rom. iii.20. This <hi>ſingle</hi> declaration, confirmed by repeated equal teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony, condemns at once every idea of juſtification by virtue of our own doings. Thoſe who harbour a ſentiment ſo oppoſed to Jehovah's revealed will, vainly imagine, conſiſtent with themſelves, to bring the ſupreme governor of univerſal nature under obligation to do <hi>them</hi> good. But, beloved, <hi>we</hi> have not ſo learned Chriſt, <hi>we</hi> do not wiſh to rob the bleſſed Redeemer of the brighteſt jewel in his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorial crown, <hi>we</hi> do not intend thus baſely to detract from that glory which peculiarly belongs to the ſacred <hi>Three-One.</hi> "For there is not a juſt man upon earth who doeth good and ſinneth not." Ecc. vii.20. "But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteouſneſſes are as filthy rags." Iſa. lxiv.6.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly. What is by too many denominated <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with goſpel terms,</hi> we do not admit as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any claim. The goſpel of our ſalvation is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conditional; it knows no <hi>terms</hi> on our part as lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a juſtifying righteouſneſs. <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> are graces beſtowed by the Spirit of God; they are bleſſings flowing from that covenant which
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:031228_0058_0FEB73E261DEAF50"/>
is ordered in all things, and ſure. In fine, regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of ſoul, ſanctification of heart, ſincerity of diſpoſition, holineſs of life, perſevering fidelity, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deviating acquieſcence in Jehovah's government, ſteady zeal for Immanuel's intereſt, all our own pious frames of mind, comfortable feelings and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving teſtimonies of conſcience are, with reſpect to this all-eſſential doctrine, to be kept <hi>totally</hi> out of view. To what, then, is our juſtification to be aſcribed?</p>
               <p>We reply, 1ſt. To the mere grace or favour of God as the <hi>moving</hi> cauſe, "being juſtified freely by his grace." Rom. iii.24. "But after that the kindneſs and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared; not by works of righteouſneſs, which we have done, but according to his mercy he ſaved us." Titus iii.4, 5. <hi>That,</hi> which never could have been found out by men or angels, the wiſdom of Jehovah contrived, and his love hath made known. <hi>This</hi> is the original ſource. Here is the fountain from whence all ſprings.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly. To the life and paſſion of Jeſus as the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing</hi> cauſe. "But God commendeth his love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, in that while we were yet ſinners, Chriſt died for us. Much more then being now <hi>juſtified by his blood,</hi> we ſhall be ſaved from wrath through him." Rom. v.8, 9. He fulfilled every precept,
<pb facs="unknown:031228_0059_0FEB73E3EDA64F50"/>
he bore the whole penalty of the law in the room and ſtead of his people: thus was the law magnified and rendered honourable, an end made of ſin and everlaſting righteouſneſs brought in; "and this is his name whereby he ſhall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS." Jeremiah xxiii.6. Oh glorious name! predicted long before his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation—Unto whom ſhould we go but unto our once bleeding but now riſen Saviour for acceptance? —For us he drank the bitter cup—Let us not ſubſtitute any thing in the place of his noble ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice—It is <hi>now</hi> a righteous thing with God, freely to <hi>juſtify</hi> and abundantly to <hi>pardon.</hi> "In the LORD ſhall all the ſeed of Iſrael be juſtified, and ſhall glory." Iſaiah xlv.25. The robe of Chriſt's righteouſneſs is a garment down to the foot, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with every member of the myſtical body is amply covered; "for he hath made him to be ſin for us, who knew no ſin; that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God, in him." 2 Cor. v.21. "Such an high prieſt became us who is holy, harmleſs, undefiled and ſeparate from ſinners." Heb. vii.26. Should any put the queſtion—How doth Chriſt's righteouſneſs, thus conſiſting of the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his nature, his active and paſſive obedience, become our's in ſuch wiſe that we alſo are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily deemed RIGHTEOUS?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="unknown:031228_0060_0FEB73E5CCF542C0"/>We readily anſwer—By IMPUTATION; by making it over unto us; reckoning it our's, or placing it to our account, being wrought out by our elder brother on behalf of the whole ranſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed flock. "David deſcribeth the bleſſedneſs of the man, unto whom God <hi>imputeth</hi> righteouſneſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out "works." Rom. iv.6.—Purſuant, therefore, to the unalterable purpoſe of heaven, agreeable to the oeconomy of man's redemption, this righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the precious Jeſus, whereof ſo many glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious things are ſpoken, is as much our's as though wrought out by ourſelves in our own proper per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Rom. v.18, 19. Phil. iii.8, 9. Thus clothed upon with raiment of needle-work—Thus united with the HEAD, how can the members be viewed by God the judge of all but as perfectly and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely juſtified? "And ye are complete in him, who is the head of all principality and power." Col. ii.10.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly. Our juſtification is by ſome aſcribed to <hi>faith</hi> as an <hi>inſtrumental</hi> cauſe. Strictly ſpeaking, we apprehend <hi>ſaith</hi> as no cauſe at all in this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentuous procedure, but rather as an effect. It is true, the ſcriptures frequently mention a <hi>juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by faith</hi>—By ſuch expreſſions it is evident the <hi>object,</hi> and not the <hi>act</hi> of faith, is deſigned: the object of faith is Chriſt and his righteouſneſs: this
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:031228_0061_0FEB73E8F3C860D0"/>
the believing ſoul holds faſt. Faith is the eye which diſcovers, the hand which receives; eſpying a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's worth, charmed with his merit, the believer is ſo enraptured as to caſt away all his heavy burden, falls at Meſſiah's feet, confides in the promiſe, and pleads atoning blood, "with the heart man believeth unto righteouſneſs." Rom. x.10. It is beautifully obſerved by one of our very firſt and moſt orthodox writers: "The reaſon why any are juſtified is not becauſe they have faith—But the reaſon why they have faith is becauſe they are juſtified." If juſtified by faith as a work performed by us, or as a grace wrought without us, where would have been the neceſſity of the death and reſurrection of Jeſus? Faith is that precious grace by which we do, in a certain manner, put on the righteouſneſs of the Lord's anointed, and receive the greateſt of all bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings from the God of our ſalvation. "It is a grace (ſaith one) which quarrels much with human pride, and makes its only boaſt of Sharon's roſe; and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was meant to be our juſtifying righteouſneſs in the ſight of God, elſe it would learn to <hi>boaſt</hi>— Faith ſays, 'In the Lord have I righteouſneſs,' and tells a ſinner, 'I cannot ſave thee,' thou art ſaved by grace <hi>through</hi> faith." The grace of Jeſus, and that alone, brings ſalvation; and the ſinner, <hi>through faith,</hi> as an inſtrument put in his hand, is enabled
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:031228_0062_0FEB73EF58462450"/>
to reach the rich donation; juſt as a begger, by his <hi>empty</hi> cap ſtretched forth, receives an alms. We proceed,</p>
               <p n="3">III. To deſcribe the objects intereſted. In the Examination of this particular, what abundant rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon have we to adopt the prophetic language, "to the law and to the teſtimony? If they ſpeak not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this word, it is becauſe there is no light in them." Iſaiah viii.20. The perſons juſtified through rich and ſovereign grace are in the living oracles declared to be "ungodly," Rom. iv.5. alſo "ſinners." Gal. ii.17. Was it not for declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions like theſe, where would be our comfort? We are all <hi>ſinners,</hi> we are all <hi>ungodly</hi>; does it from hence follow, that <hi>all</hi> who are ſinners, <hi>all</hi> who are ungodly, are without exception juſtified? By no means! the whole canon of ſcripture combine with the dictates of ſound experience to render every ſuch idea inadmiſſible. It is true, we read, "that by the righteouſneſs of one, the free gift came upon all men unto juſtification of life." Rom. v.18. By a careful reviſion of what goes before and follows after, we ſhall find the apoſtle did not mean <hi>all men</hi> abſolutely, but <hi>all the choſen, all believers</hi>; his epiſtle was directed to "all that be in Rome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of God, called to be ſaints." Moreover, the <hi>juſtified</hi> are repreſented as a <hi>peculiar</hi> people, and
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:031228_0063_0FEB73F0E361D0C8"/>
have ſuch characters aſcribed to them as cannot, without the greateſt inconſiſtency and abuſe of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, be aſcribed to all the progeny of fallen Adam. They are ſpoken of as thoſe who are predeſtinated, redeemed, pardoned, effectually called, ſanctified, regenerated, &amp;c. That theſe things are not <hi>true,</hi> with reſpect to <hi>all</hi> the lapſed family, every <hi>unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced</hi> mind muſt acknowledge. Upon the whole, thoſe who are <hi>unworthy</hi> and <hi>guilty</hi> in themſelves, but in the everlaſting covenant <hi>elected</hi> and <hi>beloved,</hi> have that righteouſneſs whereon their juſtification is founded, not only exhibited to them by the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, but brought nigh by the Holy Ghoſt, theſe are the "purchaſed poſſeſſion," this is the "bride," the lamb's wife; between whom and the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, an union not only now exiſts, but hath exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ancient as eternity itſelf, "I have loved thee with an everlaſting love: therefore, with loving kindneſs have I drawn thee," Jer. xxxi.3. a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude which no man can number. The</p>
               <p n="4">IV. And laſt thing propoſed for inveſtigation, is the bleſſings reſulting from juſtification.</p>
               <p>Where ſhall we begin, and how ſhall we end? bleſſings great indeed croud in upon us! bleſſings beyond compare are conſequential on our being thus freely juſtified! a doctrine pregnant with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort inexpreſſible! a foundation is hereby laid not
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:031228_0064_0FEB73F2B7485BE8"/>
ſimply for fluctuating hope, but for the full aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of preſent and future bliſs. By virtue hereof, we experience—1. A freedom or deliverance from ſin and condemnation. From <hi>all</hi> ſin, as to its guilt, from its reigning power and dominion, and by and by from its in-being "the blood of Jeſus Chriſt his ſon, cleanſeth us from all ſin." 1 John i.7. Heb. x.12—14. Our ſins are covered and hid from the all-penetrating eye of divine juſtice, and when ſought for hereafter ſhall not be found; "there is, therefore, now no condemnation to them who are in Chriſt Jeſus." Rom. viii.1. Gal. iii.13. When ſeriouſly reflecting on our happy reſcue from the hands of ſatan, our accuſing foe; alſo from death and the grave, as penal evils; but more eſpecially from the pains of hell and the wrath to come; and all as the effect of love divine, what heart among us can remain cold and lifeleſs? what tongue can ceaſe to praiſe?—2. As juſtified we enjoy peace with God. "Therefore, being juſtified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt." Rom. v.1. Connected herewith is real peace of mind. Oh happy ſouls! brought fully to behold a crucified Redeemer making peace by the blood of his croſs, "the chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him." Iſaiah liii.5. Knowing this to be the caſe, well may we, "on the Dove-like
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:031228_0065_0FEB73F5ECE197F0"/>
wings of faith, fly, far away from the ſtorms and tempeſts of an oppoſing conſcience, and find in the <hi>rock of ages</hi> a quiet ſanctuary and ſafe retreat." —3. The acceptance of our perſons and ſervices is another bleſſing reſulting herefrom. The Father is well pleaſed with <hi>both</hi> for the alone ſake of Chriſt his Son, "to the praiſe of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved." Eph. i.6. Chriſt's garments ſmell of myrrh, aloes and caſſia, wherewith his people being clad, the Lord ſmells a ſweet ſavor in <hi>them</hi> alſo. A view of this emboldens us to draw near to the King of kings. Heb. x.19—22. The perſon, the blood, the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, the mediation of Jeſus, are the only foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of <hi>all</hi> our <hi>pleas</hi> at the celeſtial throne.—4. As juſtified we are bleſſed through life, ſhall be ſo at death, and through eternity. While on earth, we are expreſsly aſſured that "all things work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for our good:" when ſummoned to die, we need not fear the grim meſſenger. The property of temporal death, with reſpect to God's people, is greatly changed; it puts an end to all their ſorrows, hath its ſting taken away, and will prove to be our very great gain. In honour and triumph are ſuch conveyed to the manſions above; and oh, with what joy are the everlaſting doors expanded wide for their reception! Our bodies, though moulder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:031228_0066_0FEB73FC4A12FAC0"/>
to duſt, will nevertheleſs enjoy a glorious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection—our perſons at the laſt day ſhall have an honourable diſtinction, and gracious approbation from the judge ſupreme. Never-ceaſing felicity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate happineſs, and perpetual glory will be our portion. "Eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither hath entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them who love him." 1 Cor. ii.9. We ſhall then, O joyful period! live and reign with Chriſt for ever and ever, and our ſong will uninterruptedly be, "unto him who loved us and waſhed us from our ſins in his own blood; and hath made us kings and prieſts unto God and his father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever."</p>

                  <p>That your future life ſhould be attended with the practice of the moſt brilliant virtues, and your ſoul enjoy the approving ſmiles of God, are the ardent wiſhes of your father's heart; but, my ſon, what think you will become of the guilt of thoſe offences you have now confeſſed?

                  <p>If injured <hi>Juſtice</hi> would accept ſuch return, has man therewith to offer? <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy ſoul, and with all thy might,</hi> Deut. vi.5. is the requirement of God's moſt holy law, and to which a penalty is annexed. <hi>The ſoul</hi> that ſinneth ſhall die. Now, if you can love the Lord without the ſhadow of variation, and abſtain from the leaſt appearance of evil, you might be ſomewhat more excuſeable for your conjecture of an ability to make return for your offences. Such is the ſtate of my heart, even in its beſt frame, that I cannot pray
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:031228_0069_0FEB7402E5EEE830"/>
without a wandering thought, nor attempt to love the Lord without lamenting extreme alloy; like Paul, <hi>when I would do good, evil is preſent with me.</hi> Suppoſe a holy life could be produced, will Juſtice accept it for paſt tranſgreſſions? You lately accompanied me to the <hi>ſupreme court,</hi> and heard the trial of a man criminated for a capital offence; you heard his proteſtations; but did the law accept his plea, or reverſe the ſentence? No, the judges told him they were the ſervants of the people, and the guardians of the law, which he had offended, and inſtantly pronounced upon him the ſolemn ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death. If ſuch be the inflexibility of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man law, can we ſuppoſe the holy, juſt, and good law of God capable of variation? As many as are under this law, and found ſinners, are under its curſe; for curſed is every one that continueth not in all things written in the book of the law to do them.</p>

Jeſus, the Son of God, hath engaged for ſinners. That Law and Juſtice ſhould unite in pronouncing pardon, Jeſus aſſumed our <hi>nature,</hi> was charged with our <hi>guilt,</hi> obeyed the law, and magnified it in his life, and by ſhedding of his blood and bowing in death on the croſs, he made the violated law honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and God became juſt in pardoning ſinners.

It is the ſame Jeſus that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows this blood-bought pardon, that muſt give you eyes of faith to behold his glory, and an heart to enjoy his grace. Be not overwhelmed with grief; ſinners Jeſus came to ſave, and he hath ſaid, <hi>he that cometh unto me I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> Plead with him by prayer, depreſſed as you may be, and remember that he hath promiſed his Spirit to them that aſk him,—who will help their infirmities,— teſtify of Chriſt,—apply the virtues of Chriſt,—

So, infinitely more ſo may you, my ſon, though at preſent ſurrounded with darkneſs, and filled with fear, find the way to the boſom of Jeſus, and your heart ſhall then rejoice with joy unſpeakable and full of glory!

               <head>The Life of the late Reverend and learned <hi>AU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GUSTUS MONTAGUE TOPLADY,</hi> M. A. Vicar of Broad Hembury, in Devonſhire, Great-Britain.</head>
               <p>THIS eminent ſervant of Chriſt was born at Farnham, in Surrey, Nov. 4, 1740. His father, Richard Toplady, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> a captain in the army, died at the ſiege of <hi>Carthagena</hi> ſoon after the birth of his ſon. Auguſtus received the firſt part of his education at Weſtminſter ſchool; but it becoming neceſſary for his mother to make a journey to Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, to purſue ſome claims to an eſtate in that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, he accompanied her thither, and was entered at <hi>Trinity College</hi> in Dublin, where he took his degree of <hi>Bachelor in arts.</hi> In Auguſt. 1756, being in his 16th year, the Lord viſited his ſoul with ſalvation under the miniſtry of Mr. Morris, while preaching from Eph. ii.13. "Strange, ſays Mr. Toplady, that I, who had ſo long ſat under the means of grace in England, ſhould be brought nigh to God, in an obſcure part of Ireland, amidſt an handful of God's people met together in a barn and under the miniſtry of one who could hardly ſpell his own name! Surely, it was the Lord's doing, and is marvellous! The excellency of ſuch power

muſt be of God, and cannot be of man. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generating ſpirit breathes not only <hi>on whom,</hi> but likewiſe <hi>when, where,</hi> and <hi>as</hi> HE liſteth."</p>
               <p>Mr. Toplady enjoying the comforts of religion in his ſoul, God gave him a moſt ardent deſire for the miniſtry of the goſpel; and, as he abhorred the Popiſh tenet, that "Ignorance was the mother of devotion," ſo his wiſh, as well as his duty, was, to be <hi>thoroughly furniſhed</hi>; and to avoid the preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of teaching the <hi>ignorant and thoſe that are out of the way,</hi> without having the knowledge, as well as the grace, indiſpenſibly neceſſary for that purpoſe, he purſued his ſtudies with redoubled ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, and directed them entirely for the honour of his Lord and the good of men. On June the 6th, 1762, Mr. Toplady received <hi>epiſcopal ordination,</hi> and ſome time after was inducted to the living of <hi>Broad Hembury,</hi> where he laboured in the goſpel with ſucceſs, and compoſed moſt of thoſe writings which will render ſervice to the church, and do ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to his memory, while truth and learning ſhall be eſteemed valuable among men. He had no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment in the church beſides the vicarage of Broad Hembury, which, as his mind could never brook the idea of living ill with his pariſh on account of tythes, did not amount to 80l. a year.

When I received Orders, <hi>I obtained mercy to be faithful,</hi> and from that moment gave up what is called the <hi>world,</hi> ſo far as I conceived it to interfere with faith and a good conſcience.—I can never be ſufficiently thankful, that my religious principles were all fixed long before I entered into orders. Through the good hand of my God upon me, I ſat out in the miniſtry with clear goſpel-light from the firſt; a bleſſing not vouchſafed to every one. Many an evangelical miniſter has found himſelf obliged to retract, and unſay what he had taught before in the days of his ignorance. Lord, how is it that I have been ſo ſignally favoured of Thee! O keep me to the end ſtedfaſt in thy truth! Let me but go on <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally</hi> to know Thee, and then it will be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely impoſſible for me to depart from the precious doctrines of grace; my early inſight into which I look upon as one of the diſtinguiſhed bleſſings of my life."—"For my own part," ſays he in a letter to a friend, "I wiſh to live and die with the ſword of the ſpirit in my hand, and, as Dr. Young expreſſes it, <hi>never to put off my armour till I put on my ſhroud.</hi>"—Nor did he fail of his wiſh; he had, as it

               <p>In September, 1773, on the introduction of the Rev. John Ryland, ſen. of Northampton, Great-Britain, the college in <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> conferred on Mr. Toplady the degree of MASTER IN THE ARTS. In 1775, finding his bodily conſtitution much impaired by the moiſt atmoſphere of Devon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, with which it never agreed, he removed to London. Here, by the ſolicitation of his numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous friends, and from a deſire to promote the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of Zion, he engaged the chapel belonging to the French Reformed, near Leiceſter Fields, where he continued in the exerciſe of his miniſtry as fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent as his health permitted, God crowning his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours with the moſt pleaſing ſucceſs. By a ſlow conſumption he, however, gradually drew to the period of his life. As his outward man waſted, his inward man was refreſhed and renewed, day by day. Still, while life and breath remained, he muſt be either preaching or writing, to vindicate the honour of his Maſter, and propagate the glory of evangelic truth, for the comfort of the ſouls of men. To a friend, who expreſſed ſome concern for his own eaſe in his debilitated ſtate, on his cloſe
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:031228_0076_0FEB741928E82330"/>
applications, he thus replied, "God give us to ſink deeper and deeper into his love, and to raiſe higher and higher into the image of his holineſs! and thoroughly perſuaded I am, that the more we are enabled to love and reſemble Him, the more active we ſhall be to promote his glory, and to extend his cauſe with our lips, our pens, our lives, our all. Be this our buſineſs, and our bliſs, on earth! In heaven we ſhall have nothing to do, but to <hi>ſee him as he is,</hi> to participate his glory, and to ſing his praiſe, in delightful, in never-ending concert with angels, with ſaints who are got home before us, and with thoſe of the elect, whom we knew and loved here below." The nearer he drew to the grave, the more abundantly did the conſolation of God abound in him. He looked not only with compoſure, but delight on the tomb, and groaned earneſtly to enter the manſions of the bleſſed. Dr. Young's beautiful expreſſion, <hi>one eye on death, and one full fixed on heaven,</hi>" was never more evident than in Mr. Toplady. While on his dying bed, he diſcovered a remarkable jealouſy, for fear of receiving any part of that honour which is due to Chriſt alone. He deſired to be nothing, and that Jeſus might be all, and in all.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding Mr. Toplady was so highly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with the ſmiles of the Saviour, he had a
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:031228_0077_0FEB741C555F7F20"/>
proportionate ſenſibility of his wretchedneſs as a ſinner. "Oh!" ſaid he, "that ever ſuch a wretch as I ſhould be tempted to think highly of himſelf! I that am, of myſelf, nothing but ſin and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; I, in whoſe fleſh naturally dwells no good thing; I who deſerve damnation for the beſt work I ever performed! Lord Jeſus, humble me to the duſt, yea, to the very center of abaſement, in <hi>thy</hi> preſence.

               <p>THE elephant is ſuppoſed to be the <hi>largeſt</hi> of any quadruped in the known world; and ſeems to be the <hi>wiſeſt</hi> alſo. The obſervation is Cicero's: whoſe words (<hi>De Nat. Deor.</hi> i.) are, "Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanto belluarum nualla providentior. At figurâ quae vaſtior?" All the <hi>amiable,</hi> and all the <hi>furious</hi> paſſions, are to be found in this animal: and its <hi>docility</hi> is wonderful; for, when properly tamed, he is capable of being inſtructed and diſciplined into a vaſt variety of entertaining and uſeful qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="unknown:031228_0079_0FEB7424343714A8"/>Do him a material injury, and he'll act as if he had been tutor'd by the late Lord Cheſterfield; i. e. if it be in his power, he will <hi>immediately</hi> revenge the affront; but it reſtrained for the preſent, either by motives of prudence, or by inability to wreak his reſentment, he will <hi>retain</hi> the offence in his memory for years together, and take care to repay it with intereſt, the firſt favourable opportunity. I have heard or read of a boy, who wantonly ſtruck the proboſcis, or trunk, of an elephant; and then courageouſly ſecured himſelf by running away. Seven years afterwards, the lad was playing near the ſide of a river; and had, probably, forgot his paſt miſdemeanor. But the elephant had a better memory; and, making up to the young delinquent, graſped him with his trunk, and very ſedately car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the ſprawling captive to the water; where he ducked him once or twice over head and ears, and then quietly ſetting him down again on terra firma, permitted him to walk off without further hurt.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid, that in thoſe countries where elephants abound, ſuch of them as are tame, go about the ſtreets, like any other domeſtic animal; and, it is common for people to give them fruit as they paſs. In time they commence abſolute <hi>beggars,</hi> and will put in the extremity of their trunks at doors and windows, in hope of receiving the little benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:031228_0080_0FEB74275B18C098"/>
which cuſtom has inured them to expect. After waiting a ſhort while, if nothing is given them, they withdraw their trunks, and paſs on to the next acceſſible houſe. It is related, that ſome taylors were at work, on a board, withinſide of a window whoſe caſement ſtood open. A paſſing elephant ſtopt, and put in his trunk. One of the men, inſtead of conferring a douceur, gave the animal's trunk a <hi>ſcratch</hi> with his needle. The injur'd party took no preſent notice of the provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but patiently walked away. He repaired to a neighbouring ſtream; and, having filled his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious trunk with a large quantity of water, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the window, where he coolly avenged himſelf, by ſpouting the fluid artillery on the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor and his comrades, for their late breach of hoſpitality.—If we do not <hi>relieve</hi> the indigent, they at leaſt have a right not to be <hi>inſulted.</hi> And, very frequently, the meaneſt are able, ſooner or later, to <hi>retaliate,</hi> with uſury, the contempt they undeſervedly receive.</p>
               <p>Every beggar is not <hi>honeſt.</hi> Nor are all ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants actuated by a ſtrict ſenſe of moral delicacy. Their ſmell is very acute: and if a perſon has any fruit or cakes about him, they ſhew, by the quick and judicious application of their trunks to the proper part of his dreſs, that they are adepts in
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:031228_0081_0FEB742903E17C08"/>
the art of <hi>picking pockets,</hi> with excellent dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>Elephants, like men, have (if I may be allowed the expreſſion) their <hi>virtues</hi> and their <hi>vices:</hi> though, to the honour of the former be it obſerved, the vices of an elephant bear but ſmall proportion to his virtues. There have been inſtances of theſe creatures, who, in the firſt hurry of rage for ill-treatment, have killed their keepers. But their ſubſequent <hi>remorſe</hi> has been ſo inſupportably keen, that they have refuſed to take any ſuſtenance, and literally ſtarved themſelves to death. A leſſon to perſons of <hi>violent paſſions,</hi> who, if hurried away by the impetuous torrent, either of exceſſive and unguarded <hi>anger,</hi> or of head-ſtrong and irregular <hi>deſire,</hi> are liable to the commiſſion of irreparable evil, and may, in a ſingle moment, lay the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He who, in the days of his fleſh, rebuked the raging of the winds, and ſtill'd the toſſings of the ſea, can, by the ſweet compeſcing influence of his gracious SPIRIT, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain thee within the bounds of holineſs, and ſpeak the ſtorm into a perfect calm. I have read of an Heathen, who, when he found himſelf unduly fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:031228_0082_0FEB742F53B0B1F8"/>
by the kindlings of inward wrath, would never utter a ſingle word, till he had firſt delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately run over in his mind all the letters of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabet. I have read of a Chriſtian, who, when endangered by ſimilar temptation, would not ſuffer himſelf to ſpeak a ſyllable, till he had ſilently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated the Lord's Prayer. Go, and do thou like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Repeat that prayer to God, in the ſpirit of ſupplication: and thy victory over paſſion will be more than probable.</p>
               <p>Elephants are ſingularly <hi>grateful,</hi> and have a very deep ſenſe of <hi>friendſhip.</hi> They have been known to lay the death of a <hi>brother elephant,</hi> or of a <hi>kind keeper,</hi> ſo much to heart, as to pine away from that time forward. Even virtue, if ſtrained beyond a certain pitch, degenerates into a fault. Nor is it right for us to love, with <hi>too much ardour,</hi> any periſhable good. Dr. Owen ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where remarks, that "ſtrong affections make ſtrong afflictions." Confine, therefore, your <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue</hi> regards to FATHER, SON, and SPIRIT; the Three glorious Friends, who never die, and whoſe loving-kindneſs is immortal as themſelves!</p>
               <p>In ſome countries, we are told, <hi>elephants</hi> ſupply the place of <hi>executioners.</hi> They are trained, at a given ſignal, to lay hold on the criminal with their trunks, by a ſtrong ſuction, and either <hi>daſh</hi> him
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:031228_0083_0FEB7430DCA684B8"/>
violently againſt the ground, or <hi>toſs</hi> him aloft in the air, till repeated contuſions put a period to his life.—Mankind are very prone to value themſelves on their ſuppoſed civilization; and yet, by artfully practiſing on the ferocity of inferior animals, they ſometimes teach brutes themſelves to be ſtill more brutal.</p>
               <p>Clumſey as elephants are, they may be taught to <hi>dance,</hi> both ſingly and in companies; and they move, on theſe occaſions, with ſingular exactneſs and order. They are not inſenſible to the harmony of <hi>muſic</hi>; and, if properly inured, <hi>keep time</hi> with their feet, in a manner which diſcovers great powers of judgment. If I rightly remember, Biſhop Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net informs us, in his travels, that he ſaw an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant <hi>play at ball,</hi> with all the eaſe and expertneſs of a man. But PLUTARCH, in his life of Pyrrhus, mentions a much nobler inſtance of elephantin <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding</hi> and <hi>adroitneſs</hi>; accompanied by ſuch magnanimous <hi>courage</hi> and <hi>fidelity,</hi> as would have redounded to the honour of a Sertorius, or of an Alexander. When Pyrrhus ſtormed the town of Argos, a number of accoutered elephants (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the cuſtom of thoſe times) formed a part of his military apparatus. One of theſe creatures, perceiving that his rider was fallen, invited him, by every effort in his power, to re-mount. But find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:031228_0084_0FEB7432B6F36200"/>
ſoon after, that he [viz. the rider] was dead of the wounds he had received, the animal, in a tranſport of grief and rage, ruſhed furiouſly on friends and foes, without diſtinction; and, taking up the body with his trunk, made good his retreat, and reſcued the remains of his breathleſs maſter from further violation, by faithfully and heroically conveying them from the ſcene of action.</p>
               <p>With all his magnitude and ſtrength, an elephant (if not ſour'd by unkind uſage) may be rendered ſo paſſive and gentle, as to be led and governed by a child. Juſt repreſentation of that amiable <hi>meekneſs</hi> and <hi>humility,</hi> wherewith chriſtians of <hi>exalted rank</hi> condeſcend to men of <hi>low</hi> eſtate; and perſons emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for <hi>ſuperior grace,</hi> or for <hi>diſtinguiſhed learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> bear with the infirmities, and are courteous to the ignorance of the weak. It was in this ſpirit that the excellent Doctor WATTS deſcended from the regions of philoſophy, and ſtooped from the heights of more elevated poetry, to compoſe his admirable <hi>hymns for children,</hi> and teach infant warblers to liſp the praiſes of the great THREE-ONE.</p>
               <p>The method by which wild elephants are <hi>taken,</hi> deſerves to be noticed. A narrow incloſure is made; one end of which is left open, for entrance; and, at the extremity of the other, ſeveral tame fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:031228_0085_0FEB7435F0B65E10"/>
elephants are placed. Between both (i. e. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the entrance and the extremity where the females are fixed) a large pit is dug, whoſe ſurface is lined with a ſlight bridge-work, ſo neatly turfed, that it has all the appearance of firm ground. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured by the females, the male elephants make to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the place, but are ſuddenly intercepted by the unſuſpected ſnare. Proper perſons, who are ſtationed to watch the event, ſtart from their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealments; and, with exulting ſhouts, mock the indignant diſtreſs of their unwieldy priſoners.— Striking picture of the <hi>deceitfulneſs of ſin</hi>; the unthinking folly of <hi>heedleſs minds</hi>; and the <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible effects</hi> of ſucceſsful temptation.</p>
               <p>Elephants are tamed chiefly by <hi>hunger</hi> and by <hi>blows.</hi>—Providence hides pride from man, and bends his ſtubbornneſs to obedience, by graciouſly afflictive diſpenſations.</p>

Hence the natives of Eaſt-India, who hold the doctrine of Tranſmigration, imagine that theſe animals are animated by the ſouls of departed princes. For this reaſon they are treated (eſpecially in the kingdom of <hi>Siam</hi>) with diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed reſpect; and ſome of the handſomeſt are decorated with rich ornaments, and even dignified
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:031228_0086_0FEB743C4B8835A0"/>
with titles of honour. An elephant of quality is known by the rings of gold, ſilver, or copper with which his tuſks are adorned.—There is ſomething very humiliating in the pride of human reaſon, in conduct ſo extravagantly abſurd as this. Abſolute good-nature is abſolute folly. And yet, the fanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſurmiſe of the tranſmigration of ſouls from one body into another, is attended with peculiar feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities to the poor beaſts who live in countries where that doctrine obtains. It is our duty to adopt the humanity of thoſe heathens without its abſurdities; and to be ſcrupulouſly tender of the life and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of every inferior animal entruſted to our care: knowing that the ſovereign Providence, which has made them ſubſervient to our wants, has given us no charter for the exerciſe of unneceſſary cruelty or wonton tyranny.</p>

               <head>A REMARKABLE DREAM OF THE LATE DR. DODDRIDGE.</head>
               <p>THE doctor and Dr. Clarke had been converſing together one evening upon the nature of the ſeparate ſtate, and the probability that the ſcenes on the which the ſoul would enter upon its leaving the body, would bear ſome reſemblance to thoſe with
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:031228_0087_0FEB743DD6046DC8"/>
which it had been converſant while on ear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h, that it might by degrees be prepared for the more ſublime happineſs of the heavenly world. This and other converſation of the ſame kind probably occaſioned the following dream:—</p>
               <p>The doctor imagined himſelf dangerouſly ill at a friend's houſe in London; and after laying in this ſtate for ſome time, he thought his ſoul left the body, and took its flight in ſome kind of fine vehi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, which (though very different from the body it had juſt quitted) was ſtill material. He purſued his courſe till he was at ſome diſtance from the city, when turning back, and reviewing the town, he could not forbear ſaying to himſelf, How trifling and how vain do theſe affairs, in which the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of this place are ſo eagerly employed, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to me a ſeparate ſpirit. At length, as he was continuing his progreſs, and though without any certain director, yet eaſy and happy in the thoughts of the univerſal providence and government of God, which extends alike to all ſtates and worlds, he was met by one, who told him he was ſent to conduct him to the place appointed for his abode; from whence he concluded that it could be no other than an angel, though, as I remember, he appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the form of an elderly man. They went accordingly on together, till they came within ſight
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:031228_0088_0FEB743FA7ABE240"/>
of a ſpacious building, which had the air of a palace. Upon inquiring what it was, his guide told him it was the place aſſigned for his reſidence at preſent; upon which the doctor obſerved, that he remembered to have read, while on earth, that "eye had not ſeen, nor ear heard, nor the heart conceived, what God had laid up for his ſervants;" whereas he could eaſily have conceived an idea of ſuch a building from others he had ſeen, though he acknowledged they were greatly inferior to this in elegance. The anſwer his guide made him was plainly ſuggeſted by the converſation of the evening: it was, that the ſcene firſt preſented was contrived on purpoſe to bear a near reſemblance to thoſe he had been accuſtomed to on earth, that his mind might be more eaſily and gradually prepared for thoſe glories that would open upon him hereafter, and which would at firſt have quite dazzled and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered him.</p>
               <p>By this time they were come up to the palace; and his guide led him through a kind of ſaloon into an inner parlour. The firſt thing that ſtruck him was a large golden cup that ſtood upon the table, on which was emboſſed the figure of a vine and cluſters of grapes. He aſked his guide the meaning of this; who told him, it was the cup in which his Saviour drank new wine with his diſciples in his
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:031228_0089_0FEB7442EE86CFF8"/>
kingdom; and that the figures cared on it were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſignify the union between Chriſt and his people, implying, that as the grapes derive all their beauty and flavour from the vine, ſo the ſaints, even in a ſtate of glory, were indebted for the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and happineſs of their union with their Head, in whom they are all complete. While they were thus converſing, he heard a tap at the door, and was informed by the angel, that it was the ſignal of his Lord's approach, and was intended to prepare him for the interview. Accordingly, in a ſhort time, he thought our Saviour entered the room; and, upon his caſting himſelf at his feet, he gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly raiſed him up, and with a look of inexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible complacency, aſſured him of his favour, and his kind acceptance of his faithful ſervices: and, as a token of his peculiar regard, and the intimate friendſhip he intended to honour him with, he took the cup, and, after drinking of it himſelf, gave it into his hands. The doctor would have declined it at firſt, as too great an honour; but his Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, (as to Peter, in relation to waſhing his feet) "If thou drink not with me, thou haſt no part in me." This ſcene, he obſerved, filled him with ſuch a tranſport of gratitude, love, and admiration, that he was ready to ſink under it. His Maſter ſeemed ſenſible of it, and told him he muſt leave
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:031228_0090_0FEB74494A4EAC00"/>
him for the preſent, but it would not be long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he repeated his viſit; and, in the mean time, he would find enough to employ his thoughts in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting on what had paſſed, and in contemplating the objects around him. As ſoon as his Lord was retired, and his mind a little compoſed, he obſerved the room was hung round with pictures; and, upon examining them more attentively, he diſcovered, to his great ſurprize, that they contained the hiſtory of his own life. The moſt remarkable ſcenes he had paſſed through being thus repreſented in the moſt lively manner, it may eaſily be imagined how much this would ſtrike and affect his mind. The many temptations and trials he had been expoſed to, and the ſignal inſtances of the divine goodneſs towards him in the different periods of his life, which by this means were all preſented at once to his view, excit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſtrongeſt emotions of gratitude; eſpecially when he reflected, that he was now out of the reach of any future diſtreſs, and that all the purpoſes of divine love and mercy towards him were at length happily accompliſhed. The ecſtacy of joy and thankfulneſs into which theſe reflections threw him, were ſo great, that they awoke him. But for ſome conſiderable time after he aroſe, the impreſſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſo lively, that tears of joy flowed down his cheeks; and he ſaid, that he never on any occaſion
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:031228_0091_0FEB744AD5004438"/>
remembers to have felt ſentiments of devotion, love, and gratitude, equally ſtrong.</p>

               <head>RESIGNATION.</head>
               <p>ONE of the moſt remarkable inſtances of human reſignation I ever remember to have met with, is to be found in the conduct of <hi>Archbiſhop Fenelon.</hi> When his illuſtrious and hopeful pupil, the <hi>Duke of Burgundy,</hi> lay dead in his coffin, and the nobles of his court, in all the pomp of ſilent ſadneſs, ſtood weeping around, the <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> came into the apartment, and having fixed his eyes for ſome time on the <hi>corpſe,</hi> uttered the ſenſibility of his ſoul to this effect:—"There lies my beloved prince, for whom my affections were equal to the tendereſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the tendereſt parent. Nor were my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections loſt; he loved me in return with all the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of a ſon. There he lies, and all my worldly happineſs lies dead with him! But if the turning of a <hi>ſtraw</hi> would call him back to life, I would not, for ten thouſand worlds, be the turner of that ſtraw, in oppoſition to the WILL of God."

               <p>ON the 5th of March, 1796, departed this life, Miſs REBECCA MOULDER, of this city, in the 26th year of her age. Her remains were interred in the Baptiſt burying ground, attended by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable

               <head>AN ESSAY On the Influence of Grace upon the Soul of Man.</head>
               <p>AS, when a river is turned into a new channel, the ſtream forſakes its ancient bed, and purſues a courſe unknown till then; ſo the ſoul of man, when its native captivity to ſin and death, is <hi>turned as the rivers in the South,</hi> flows back to God, from whom it ran before; nor ceaſes to flow, till it has gained the ocean of infinite good.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="unknown:031228_0103_0FEB7467C7F4AEA0"/>This is the inſeparable effect of union and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Chriſt. The glorious liberty of the children of God, is a liberty from the darkneſs of unbelief, and from the bondage of moral corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, into the light of faith, the fire of love, and law of righteouſneſs. That queſtion in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Can the Ethiopean change his ſkin, or the leopard his ſpots?</hi> admits of a favourable ſolution. The converting SPIRIT of God does that for us which we could never do for ourſelves. He makes the Ethiopean, in a moral ſenſe, fair as the driven ſnow; and renders the ſpotted leopard ſpotleſs, in compariſon of what he was. The vaſſals of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity became veſſels of glory; and the ſoul that once cleaved to the duſt of ſenſuality, and lay dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, is quicken'd from above, and made to ſit in heavenly places with Chriſt Jeſus. When the citadel of the human heart is taken by grace, the enemy's colours are diſplaced; Satan's uſurped authority is ſuperſeded; the ſtandard of the Croſs is erected on the walls; and the ſpiritual rebel takes the vow of willing allegiance to Chriſt, his rightful ſovereign. The ſtrong holds to ſin on one hand, and of ſelf-righteouſneſs on the other, are batter'd down; and the ſoul, from that bleſſed moment, made free indeed, crys out, <hi>Other lords have had dominion over me; but the darkneſs is

paſt, and the true light now ſhines: the ſnare is broken, and I am deliver'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From this experience of the divine power in our own hearts, we cannot but adopt the celeſtial anthem, <hi>Glory to God in the higheſt, and on earth peace, good-will towards men!</hi> Our Converſion becomes known to all; and ſome of the practical effects, produced by, and connected with, that great diſplay of grace, are theſe that follow:—</p>
               <p>Where <hi>Luſt,</hi> that fiery ſerpent, was wont to crawl, divine LOVE kindles her hallow'd flame, and raiſes the affections, as on eagles' wings, to heaven.</p>
               <p>Where <hi>Unbelief,</hi> blind and ſullen as the mole, lay wrapt in malicious gloom, loving darkneſs ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than light, and ſeeking to undetermine what ſhe had not eyes to ſee, FAITH diffuſes the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of celeſtial day, and leads the willing ſoul to Him who bought her with his blood.</p>
               <p>Where <hi>Inſenſibility,</hi> thoughtleſs as the bird that haſtens to the ſnare, and gay as a victim crowned for the ſlaughter, ſported on the precipice of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and danced on the verge of death, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious CONVICTION fixes her keen, but ſalutary weapon; and filial FEAR keeps the avenues of the converted perſon's heart, and the actions of his life, in powerful, but ſweet, reſtraint.</p>
               <p>

               <head>A PRESERVATION.</head>
               <p>SIR James Thornhill was the perſon who paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the inſide of the famous <hi>cupola</hi> of St. Paul's, London. After having finiſhed one of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments, he ſtepped back, gradually, to ſee how it would look at a diſtance. He receded ſo far (ſtill keeping his eye intently fixed on the painting) that he was got almoſt to the very edge of the ſcaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding, without perceiving it: had he continued to retreat half a minute more, he muſt have fallen to the pavement beneath, and completed his deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. A perſon preſent, who ſaw the danger the great artiſt was in, had the happy preſence of mind to ſnatch up one of the bruſhes, and daubed it over the painting. Sir James, tranſported with rage, ſprung forward to ſave the remainder of the piece. But his rage was ſoon turned into thanks, when the perſon addreſſed him—"Sir, by ſpoiling the paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I have ſaved the life of the painter. You had advanced to the extremity of the ſcaffold, without

knowing it. Had I called to you, to apprize you of your danger, you would naturally have turned to look behind you; and the ſurpriſe of finding yourſelf in ſuch a dreadful ſituation, would have haſtened your fall. I had, therefore, no other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of retrieving you but by acting as I did."</p>
               <p>Not altogether diſſimilar to this is God's conduct to his people. It is the vain employ of ſinful man, by the imperfect duties of his life, to draw his own portrait, in ſuch deluſive colours, as to eſteem him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf worthy the attention of the Almighty; and, after the performance is executed, to view himſelf in every favourable light to gratify the vanity of his ſelf-righteous heart, although every ſtep he takes in the review, haſtens his unwary feet to a fall which muſt complete his deſtruction. But, it is the determination of the God of Grace, <hi>to ſtain the pride of all human glory</hi>; and, as the by-ſtander daubed the painting of Sir James Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill, purpoſely to ſave his life from death, ſo the LORD the SPIRIT mars our legal performances, ſhews us the guilt that attends them, and their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>efficiency to juſtify us before the tribunal of JEHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VAH; then directs our attention to JESUS, the Son of God, <hi>the Lord our Righteouſneſs; who, being the brightneſs of his</hi> FATHER<hi>'s glory, and the expreſs image of his</hi> PERSON, <hi>having purged

               <head>The Life of the late Reverend and learned <hi>AU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GUSTUS MONTAGUE TOPLADY,</hi> M. A. Vicar of Broad Hembury, in Devonſhire, Great-Britain. (Continued from page <hi>72,</hi> and concluded.)</head>
               <p>ON a friend's ſuggeſting to Mr. Toplady the loſs which the Church of Chriſt would ſuſtain by his death, the utmoſt diſcompoſure was viſible in his countenance, and with extreme ſenſibility he exclaimed, "What, by my death? No! By my death? No! Jeſus Chriſt is able, and will, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per inſtruments, defend his own truths. And with regard to what little I have been enabled to do in this way, not to me, but to his name, and to that only, be the glory." A ſhort time preceding his death, his friend and phyſician, on his own earneſt requeſt, informing him that his heart and arteries evidently beat, every day, weaker and weaker; he
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:031228_0112_0FEB74832CB079B8"/>
replied immediately with a ſmile,—"<hi>Why, that's a good ſign, that my death is faſt approaching; and bleſſed be God, I can add, that my heart beats every day ſtronger and ſtronger for glory.</hi>"</p>
               <p>Another friend took the liberty to aſk him, if in his preſent ſituation he had any <hi>doubt</hi> remaining upon his mind reſpecting the <hi>truth</hi> of thoſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples he had ſo warmly propagated in his miniſtry. He replied,—"<hi>Doubt, Sir, doubt! Pray uſe not that word when ſpeaking of me. I cannot endure the term; at leaſt while God continues to ſhine upon my ſoul, in the gracious manner he now does. Not,</hi>" added he, "<hi>but that I am ſenſible, that while in the body, if left of him, I am capable, through the power of temptation, of calling into queſtion every truth of the goſpel; but that is ſo far from being the caſe, that the manifeſtation and comforts of his love are ſo abundant as to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my ſtate the moſt deſirable in the world. I would not exchange my condition with any one upon earth. And with reſpect to my principles, thoſe bleſſed truths which I have been enabled in my poor meaſure to maintain, appear to me more than ever, moſt gloriouſly indubitable. My own exiſtence is not, to my apprehenſion, a greater cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty. To me ſickneſs is no affliction; pain no curſe; death itſelf no diſſolution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="unknown:031228_0113_0FEB74865E1AAE28"/>A few days before his death, he ſaid to a friend, with his hands claſped, and his eyes lifted up, flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with tears of evident joy, "<hi>O, my dear Sir, I cannot tell you the comforts I feel in my ſoul: they are paſt expreſſion! The conſolations of God to ſuch an unworthy wretch are ſo abundant, he leaves me nothing to pray for, but a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of them. I enjoy an heaven already in my ſoul. My prayers are all converted into praiſe. Nevertheleſs, I do not forget that I am ſtill in the body, and liable to all thoſe diſtreſſing fears which are incident to human nature when under temptations, and without any ſenſible divine ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. But ſo long as the preſence of God conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues with me in the degree I now enjoy it, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but think that ſuch a deſponding frame is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible.</hi>" The nearer he drew to his deceaſe, the more happy and heavenly he appeared in his ſpirit and converſation. Founded upon the rock Chriſt Jeſus, and influenced with the Father's ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting love, he ſtands againſt the ſhock of mortal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity. The truth he preached to others, being the food and nouriſhment of his own ſoul, he now finds their ſweetneſs to counterpoiſe the ſorrows of the grave. Happy, unſpeakably happy is that man, and eſpecially that miniſter, who is thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely taught and enriched by a God of all grace!
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:031228_0114_0FEB748CAEDD7B78"/>
The truth of Chriſt ſhall make them free from every fear, and ſafe conduct their feet through the ſhades of death; while the unhappy formaliſt, and ſelf-taught profeſſor, will tremble and ſink beneath the proſpect of immortality.</p>
               <p>Not long before his exit Mr. Toplady exclaimed, "<hi>O how this ſoul of mine longs to be gone! like a bird impriſoned in a cage, it longs to take its flight. O that I had wings like a dove! then would I flee away to the realms of bliſs, and be at reſt forever!</hi>" Being aſked by a friend, if he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways enjoyed ſuch comforts, he anſwered, "<hi>I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay there are no intermiſſions; for if there were not, my conſolations would be more and greater than I could poſſibly bear; but, when they abate, they leave ſuch an abiding ſenſe of God's goodneſs, and of the certainty of my being fixed upon the eternal rock of Chriſt Jeſus, that my ſoul is ſtill filled with peace and joy.</hi>" A little before his departure, he bleſſed God for continuing to him his underſtanding in clearneſs; but added, with a rapture,—"<hi>Moſt of all, his abiding preſence, and the ſhining of his love upon my ſoul. The ſky is clear; there is no cloud; come Lord Jeſus, come quickly!</hi>" Soon after this he cloſed his eyes, the 11th of Auguſt, 1778, and found, as Milton ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes it

               </p>
               <p>The corpſe of Mr. Toplady, agreeably to his own deſire, was interred in <hi>Tottenham Court Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi> in a remarkably deep grave, in preſence of a concourſe of people. And, notwithſtanding Mr. Toplady had frequently expreſſed his diſapprobation of any funeral ſermon being delivered on his death, yet the REVEREND ROWLAND HILL could not forbear aſcending the pulpit at the interment, and made a very ſolemn and affectionate addreſs to the thronged church.</p>

                  <speaker>Deacon.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, what in the world is the matter with you, you look mighty poorly; come, ſit down
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:031228_0116_0FEB74904521B880"/>
Colonel. Are markets low that make you feel ſo ugly?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Col.</speaker>
                  <p>Deacon, as old a man as you are you never heard the like in all your days; there is that great man Thomas Paine been writing againſt the <hi>bible,</hi> and a great many <hi>Yorkers</hi> take ſide with him, and if ſomething is not done, they will all turn deiſts. Here, Deacon Ridly, is the book; do look at it; I bought it at Swords's, in Pearl-ſtreet.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Deacon.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, well, I will look at this mighty book. Molly, hand me your grand-mother's ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacles. Perhaps, Colonel, you are more afraid than hurt. I gueſs you are miſtaken about the folks in York; I have long thought many of them did not like the <hi>bible</hi> mighty well, and only wanted Tom Paine's fine French cloak to walk in.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Col.</speaker>
                  <p>Stay, Deacon, not quite ſo hard;—Paine reaſons deſperately indeed;—let me ſhew you this place. Ah! there it is, he ſtrikes home at the root. (P. 13)—"Revelation, when applied to religion, means ſomething communicated <hi>immediately</hi> from God to man. No one will deny or diſpute the power of the Almighty to make ſuch a communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation if he pleaſes. But admitting for the ſake of a caſe, that ſomething has been revealed to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain perſon, and not revealed to any other perſon, it is revelation to that perſon only. When he tells
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:031228_0117_0FEB7496CC4747B0"/>
it to a ſecond perſon, a ſecond to a third, and a third to a fourth, and ſo on, it ceaſes to be a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to all thoſe perſons. It is a revelation to the firſt perſon only, and <hi>hereſay</hi> to every other, and conſequently they are not obliged to believe it." Now Deacon, how am I to know whether the bible be a revelation of God or not—Is it <hi>hereſay</hi> to me!</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Deacon.</speaker>
                  <p>So, ſo, let me ſee if I can't take this <hi>Tom Fox</hi> by the tail, and take off his firebrand. Do Colonel hand me that book on the ſhelf; 'tis <hi>Paine's Common Senſe.</hi>—See here,— (p. 7.) On monarchy and hereditary ſucceſſion, he quotes the ſcriptures, and ſays, <hi>it is worth attending to,</hi> and ſhews the origin, and ſucceſſion of the kings of Iſrael; <hi>theſe portions of ſcripture,</hi> ſays he, <hi>are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and poſitive; they admit o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> to equivocal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction</hi>; and then brings in the atteſtation of the Almighty in this caſe. Here Colonel, you ſee, to point his pen againſt KINGS, he gives full credit to the bible, as much as any <hi>parſon</hi> in America; but when he got into France, he loſt his "<hi>Common Senſe,</hi>" and calls the bible a <hi>hereſay.</hi> Thus you ſee Paine is either a <hi>believer</hi> or an <hi>unbeliever,</hi> as ſuits his own purpoſe.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Col.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, Deacon, I never ſaw you ſo merry in all my born days; I thought to be ſure, you
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:031228_0118_0FEB749856A1BF38"/>
would have burſt your eyes in tears! But look a little farther and you will ſee,—aye, there it is, (p. 50) how he talks about the Saviour having <hi>no learning,</hi> and that he could not <hi>write.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Deacon.</speaker>
                  <p>Aye, ſo he does. Take the bible Colonel, and turn to John viii.6. and you will there ſee, <hi>Jeſus ſtooped down and with his finger</hi> WROTE <hi>on the ground,</hi> when the accuſers of the adultreſs were before him. But, ſee here Colonel, in the very ſame page, Paine ſays, "Jeſus Chriſt called men to the practice of moral virtues, and the belief of one God," therefore, Jeſus muſt have had the beſt ſort of learning.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Col.</speaker>
                  <p>Very true, Deacon. There is another place where he calls St. Paul a <hi>manufacturer of quibbles,</hi> (p. 54)—the book of Revelations is a <hi>riddle,</hi> (p. 32) and ſays <hi>the metaphor of a diſhclout</hi> might have been introduced as a <hi>type,</hi> (p. 146.)</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Deacon.</speaker>
                  <p>Paul was conſiſtent in his writings, and not like Paine, in his Common Senſe approving the Scripture, and in his Age of Reaſon denying it; therefore was no quibbler.—The Revelation may appear a riddle to Paine, ſimply becauſe he had no eyes to read it, nor inclination to compare it with the ſucceſſive events of time; and, as to the metaphor of a <hi>diſhclout,</hi> if he had looked ſharp, he would have found it already in Jeremiah. <hi>All our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſes
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:031228_0119_0FEB749A08434F88"/>
are as filthy rags,</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Isaiah lxiv.6.</note> and if poor Tom had known his own heart, he would have found it in God's ſight more filthy than the dirtieſt diſhclout ever handled by a ſcullion in his kitchen. However, Colonel, as Dr. Linn ſays, in his Sermon on the <hi>Times,</hi> "That book, which hath for ſo many ages ſtood the roaring of the lion, may well ſtand the braying of an aſs."</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Col.</speaker>
                  <p>Paine alſo ſays that the Chriſtian Church ſprung out of the tail of the heathen mythology; and, Deacon, there are many things in ſcripture that look a little that way. (p. 17 and 97.)</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>

                  <p>I gueſs, Colonel, this rather comes from Paine's <hi>head</hi> than the heathen's tail. Now, Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, I wonder our <hi>dominies</hi> do not more explain theſe things to their people; but let that be as it may, if you compare the heathen mythology with the ſcripture, you will find that the heathen mythology is a corruption from the ſcripture; you know on man's expulſion from Paradiſe, God placed <hi>che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims</hi> to guard the tree of life; and, no doubt, Cain being familiar therewith, he and his poſterity, on their ſettlement, not fearing the true God, made gods of their own from that figure. The ſame cherubims were appointed in the Tabernacle of Moſes; in the Temple of Solomon; and, mightily ſpoken of by

Ezekiel: now, theſe cherubims, in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> anſwer to the <hi>elements of Nature</hi>; and when the tribes revolted under Jereboam, they carried the idea of theſe hieroglyphics among the heathen, and thus, in my opinion, <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and all the other heathen gods, were eſtabliſhed and worſhipped, as they all anſwer in their names and natures to the four faces of the cherubims, as you may ſee explained by the learned Mr. Parkhurſt, in his Hebrew Lexicon.</p>

                  <p>I'll tell you, Colonel; you know Paine was then in the clutches of the French Convention, many of whom were deiſts greater than himſelf; and, to recommend himſelf to their favour, and ſave his neck from Louis's cutting-knife, the <hi>gul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotine,</hi> I gueſs he wrote againſt the bible.

of a Saviour revealed, or periſh. But, Colonel, I ſee Paine as in the hand of Providence. <hi>France,</hi> you know, for many ages, has been as <hi>cup</hi> of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity and ſuperſtition: in order for the reception of the pure <hi>wine</hi> of the Goſpel, the <hi>cup</hi> muſt be emptyed; and I look upon Paine's book as a juſt deſcription of the preſent ſtate of religion, if ſuch it may be called, in that country; and thus he is the hand that ſhews us the contents of the <hi>cup</hi> of abominations. The time, I believe, is not far diſtant, when truth and righteouſneſs ſhall flouriſh among that people, and the pure doctrines of Chriſt ſhall ariſe upon the ruins of infidelity. But, ſtay Colonel, what is this he ſays, (p. 71)—"I keep no bible." The only true word in all his book, and a plain proof of his ignorance and contempt of the ſubject.</p>

               <p>FOR a profeſſed chriſtian to enter a place of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic worſhip when ſervice is half performed, is attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with extreme diſadvantages to himſelf, and many inconveniences to others; conſequently merits friendly admonition.</p>
               <p>Such a perſon, however, may reply, "better late than never;" but, on ſerious reflection, he muſt find his tardy ſteps expoſe him to ſevere reflection. Does he not give others leave to imagine he has indulged a bed of ſloth, eſpecially when on every other morning in the week he is known to be firſt at market, and the earlieſt at his buſineſs? Who can ſuppoſe he has had time for either family or cloſet Devotion; or if performed at all, it muſt have been in a buſtle to get to Church before ſermon. May not many ſteady worſhippers imagine, that this ſlothful chriſtian, however he may talk of loving ſermons, can have little idea of the true worſhip of the great God, when he enters the door after pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? Should he be equally late in his attendance in the afternoon, who but may imagine he has too freely eat at his table; or has taken a few glaſſes too many? This, however, is certain, no one has
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:031228_0123_0FEB74A6C8240F88"/>
reaſon to ſuppoſe his mind in a lively frame for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; that he loves the habitation of the Almighty; feels a warm attachment to God's ſaints; or is a lover of prayer and praiſe.</p>
               <p>This evil does not reſt alone upon or with himſelf. What a bad example does he ſet his family, and others in the congregation, eſpecially young perſons, who need every ſtimulus to duty! What an interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to public worſhip is it for a perſon to bounce in, and almoſt out of breath, to take his ſeat, while ſervice is performed? And, what a diſcouragement is it to the miniſter to ſee ſo little fruit of his labour, and perhaps to be interrupted in his work by this negligent attendant, who catches the eye of every body in the church?</p>
               <p>It is granted, that lawful, unavoidable obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may occur to prevent a perſon's timely atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on worſhip; where this is the real caſe, it will create the pain of diſappointment in that breaſt which glows with ardour for Communion with God in his ſanctuary; but it is to be feared, many, very many habitually neglect a due attendance on the houſe of the Lord, and need admonition to quicken their ſteps, which, if effected hereby, will anſwer the deſired end of this paper.</p>

               <head>THE REFLECTION.</head>
               <p>AM I a ſinner?—The conviction of my conſci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ence, the events of my life, and the law of my creation, confirm the ſolemn truth. Sin has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in my breaſt unhallowed deſires, deranged by mental powers, and debaſed my ſofter paſſions; it prepareth for my ſteps a thorny path, and creates a ſtubborn will, averſe to all that's good. In vain I paſs the buſy ſcenes of life, or ſeek to drown my conſcious ſenſibility among the ſons of mirth: theſe enhance my pain in reflecting hours, and arm my pillow with thorns, more piercing than the poiſoned arrow. I am amenable to HIM who made me. This, a conſcience ſomething, reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent within, announces. And this I learn from the various ſcenes of life, and the paſſage of my fellow mortals, though againſt their will, to a ſtate from which they never, never will return. Ah! my ſoul, every fleeting moment brings thee nearer to the fatal criſis, when thou, and all that's mortal, ſhalt bid adieu, and then to ſtand before thy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker's auguſt throne. But O!—this God is good, and mercy dwells with him. Yet, ſay my ſoul, this God is righteous too; nor can his goodneſs, nor his mercy, reach thee as a ſinner, at expence
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:031228_0125_0FEB74AD20B42D58"/>
ſo dear as forfeiture of juſtice. If there be a God, immutable muſt be his attributes; nor one impeach or croſs another. How then, as a ſinner, canſt thou hope to meet his ſmiles?—Sayeſt thou, revolve, repent; yet alas! who will pay the old arrear! Will repenting tears obliterate the awful debt I owe? But, ſhould I ſay I will repent, can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance flow from a heart ſo hard and vile as mine? The terrors of my God forbid repentance; inflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is his law, and exorable is his juſtice;—my guilty breaſt feels encruſted; my tears refuſe to flow; nor can I find repentance, though by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance I ſhould be ſaved. Whither then wouldſt thou fly? Survey the ſtores of nature, if a victim can be found to ſatisfy thy God;—ſee, if among her choiceſt ſweets, a balm ſo full of virtue can be found to make the whole. All, all is vain! "Shall I come before the Lord with burnt-offerings, with calves of a year old? Will the Lord be pleaſed with thouſands of rams, or with ten thouſands of rivers of oil? Shall I give my firſt born for my tranſgreſſion, the fruit of my body for the ſin of my ſoul?" Theſe, alas! have no merit for human of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; and the very offering of them would betray my folly and accumulate my guilt. What ſaid Abraham to his ſon?—"God will provide himſelf a lamb for a burnt-offering." Gen. xxii.8. The

goſpel points me to that Lamb; God's co-equal, co-eternal Son—that Lamb, who was lead to the ſlaughter; bled beneath the ſtroke of juſtice; and whoſe atoning ſacrifice is accepted by that God againſt whom my ſins ariſe. Here then will I reſt. On this rock of ſalvation will I caſt my ſoul with all its guilt and cares. O thou bleeding, ſuffering dying Lamb of God, who taketh away the ſin of the world; waſh me in thy precious blood, clothe me in thy juſtifying righteouſneſs, and, by thy ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, efficacious grace, reſtore my heart, my life, my ſoul, to thy holy image! and when fleſh and heart ſhall fail, be thou the ſtrength of my life and my portion for ever.</p>

The love of Chriſt engaged my heart;—I wept;—I prayed.

               <head>ON THE LOVE OF CHRIST. In a Letter to the Right Hon. Lady Frances Shirley, by the late Rev. James Hervey.</head>
               <opener>
                  <salute>MY LADY,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>ON Saturday in the afternoon, I promiſed myſelf a ſingular pleaſure, the pleaſure of writing to your Ladyſhip; but was hindered from enjoying it, by company which could not be left, and my buſineſs which could not be poſtponed.</p>
               <p>I think, my Lady, you have a note under my hand, for a few thoughts on <hi>The Love of</hi> CHRIST. How glad am I to pay, as far as my ability will reach, all my obligations to your Ladyſhip! eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when they are of a nature ſo peculiarly pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Shall we then conſider</p>
               <p>The <hi>original</hi> of his love? It is free; perfectly free; without any deſert, or the leaſt amiableneſs in us. We love our kind friends, and generous benefactors: thoſe that are accompliſhed in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or ſerviceable to our intereſts. But CHRIST loved us when we were <hi>ſinners</hi>; when we were <hi>forgetful</hi> of him; nay, enemies to him, by evil tempers, and wicked works. He loved us, (O ſovereign, moſt unmerited kindneſs!) when we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:031228_0137_0FEB74D71E7E5DB0"/>
                  <hi>nothing,</hi> but utter abhorrence, and eternal vengeance.</p>
               <p>The <hi>commencement</hi> of his love. His love is not of yeſterday. His love, like his outgoings, is from everlaſting. <hi>I have loved thee,</hi> ſays he to his church, <hi>with an everlaſting love.</hi> We value the affection that is of long ſtanding; has taken deep root; and ſtill continues unſhaken. <hi>How ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, then, is thy loving kindneſs,</hi> O bleſſed JESUS! which, <hi>before the mountains were brought forth, or ever the earth and the world were made,</hi> was fixed upon ſinful duſt! O! that we, my Lady, ſhould be in the thoughts, be upon the very heart, of GOD's adorable Son, even from the ages of eternity?</p>
               <p>The <hi>duration</hi> of his love. It is invariable and eternal. <hi>Having loved his own, he loveth them even unto the end.</hi> It neither began with time, neither will it end with time. As no worthineſs in us cauſed it, ſo neither will our failings extinguiſh it; no, nor our infirmities damp it. We change frequently; our holy frames fail; but our adored Redeemer is the <hi>ſame yeſterday, to-day, and for ever.</hi> Fear not then, my honoured Lady, <hi>neither life nor death, nor things preſent, nor things to come, nor any other creature, ſhall be able to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate us from the</hi> ever tender, the ever conſtant, the ever triumphant <hi>love of</hi> GOD our Saviour!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="unknown:031228_0138_0FEB74D8A8D13BE8"/>The <hi>effects</hi> of his love. It brought him from the heaven of heavens, to dwell in clay, and be lodged in a manger. It brought him from thoſe happy manſions, where is the <hi>fulneſs of joy,</hi> and where <hi>are pleaſures for evermore</hi>; to be <hi>deſtitute, afflicted, tormented</hi> in this vale of tears. O my Lady! it made him, who is heir of all things, not to have where to lay his head; till he was ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Croſs, and laid it in the gloom of the grave. Unparalleled and ſtupendous! <hi>Who can declare the noble acts of the</hi> Redeemer's love, <hi>or ſhew forth its praiſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>fruits</hi> of this love. To this is owing all the good we poſſeſs or expect; every ſpiritual and heavenly bleſſing. If our eyes are enlightened, in any degree, to ſee the things that belong to our peace: if our deſires are awakened, to ſeek the <hi>inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away:</hi> for this we are indebted to the love and grace of CHRIST. If we are ſanctified in part, and deſirous to grow in true godlineſs: if we are perfectly juſtified before GOD, and adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be his ſons and daughters: theſe alſo are ſtreams, which iſſue from that inexhauſtible foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, THE LOVE OF CHRIST. As it was ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than death, in its actings and ſufferings; it is richer than all worlds in its precious, precious fruits.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="unknown:031228_0139_0FEB74DA5AFF3970"/>Juſtly, therefore, does the ſcripture make uſe of all the endearing relations, that ſubſiſt among mankind, to repreſent the love of CHRIST. Great is the love of a friend; greater the love of a brother; greater ſtill the love of a parent; greateſt of all the love of a bridegroom: but infinitely greater than any, than all, is the love of the ever bleſſed IMMANUEL to his people. When all has been ſaid, all has been imagined; it tranſcends every compariſon; it exceeds all thought; or, as St. Paul ſpeaks, <hi>it paſſes knowledge.</hi>—May your Ladyſhip have more and more exalted apprehenſions of it; and live under a delightful ſenſe of its rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and perpetuity!—May it be your ſweet incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to every duty, and your ſovereign cordial under all tribulation!—And when eternity, the vaſt eternity opens, it ſhall be, in a ſenſe that no heart can conceive, your crown of rejoicing; your exceeding great reward.—And, I hope, you will ſometimes pray, that it may be the preſent comfort, and eternal joy of, my Lady, your Ladyſhip's much obliged, and moſt dutiful humble ſervant,</p>

               <p>THE late excellent and reverend Mr. James Hervey, Rector of Weſton Flavel, being one day on a journey, a lady who happened to be in the ſame carriage with him, was expatiating in a very particular manner on the amuſements of the ſtage, as being, in her eſteem, ſuperior to any other plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. Among other things ſhe ſaid, "There was the pleaſure of thinking on the play before ſhe went, the pleaſure ſhe enjoyed when there, and the pleaſure of ruminating upon it when on her bed at night." Mr. Hervey, (who ſat and heard her diſcourſe without interrupting her) when ſhe had concluded, ſaid to her, that there was one pleaſure more beſides what ſhe had mentioned that ſhe had forgot. "What can that be?" ſaid ſhe, "for ſure I have included every pleaſure, when I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the enjoyment before hand—at the time— and afterwards. Pray, Sir, what is it?" To which Mr. Hervey, with a grave look, and in a manner peculiarly amiable to himſelf, anſwered, "Madam, the pleaſure that it will give you on your DEATH-BED."
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:031228_0141_0FEB74E3E0A68928"/>
A clap of thunder, or a flaſh of lightning could not have ſtruck her with more ſurprize. The ſtroke went to her very heart, and ſhe had not one word to ſay, but ſeemed quite occupied in thinking upon it. In ſhort, the conſequence of that well-timed word was, that ſhe never went any more to the play-houſe, but became a pious woman, and a follower of thoſe pleaſures which would afford her true ſatisfaction on her death-bed.</p>

               <p>LOVE to God is the eſſence of perſonal reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; without it the moſt ſplendid profeſſion is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfying and vain. It will be our attempt in this eſſay to explain the principles on which God has
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:031228_0151_0FEB7502B01956D8"/>
a right to demand our affections, and the felicity of that man who loves the Lord with all his heart.</p>
               <p n="1">I. From the natural relation which ſubſiſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and the creature, he has a right to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand our affections. When the Almighty form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man, he enriched his ſoul with a propenſity to love; and upon the exerciſe of this paſſion the baſis of human happineſs was formed. Love is the moſt ſenſible, operative, viſible paſſion of the human ſoul, and leads every other in its train; in the exerciſe of this our firſt parents, in their primeval ſtate, graſped the viſion of JEHOVAH, as the God of univerſal Nature, and thereby experienced the moſt inconceivable delight. This claim is conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with the honour of God, and the intereſt of his creature, and is ſupported by an holy and an inflexible <hi>law</hi>; the tenor of which is, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy ſoul, and with all thy ſtrength.</hi> Deut. vi.4, 5. Adam, in Paradiſe, did thus love the Lord his God; but, on the entrance of ſin, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God was turned into darkneſs, the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were contaminated, enmity reared its baneful head, and man fled with precipitation from the voice of his Maker. Nor was this change in Adam's heart peculiar to him alone—by his <hi>diſobedience many were made ſinners.</hi> Rom. v.19. <hi>The carnal
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:031228_0152_0FEB7504434D2760"/>
mind is enmity againſt God; it is not ſubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</hi> Rom. viii.7. Jeſus ſaid unto the Jews, <hi>I know ye that ye have not the love of God in you.</hi> John v.42. Thus, although man be under a natural and moral obligation to love God, and the divine right to the creature's affections ſtill abides, the fact is too ſtubborn to be denied, that mankind, univerſally ſo by nature, <hi>are lovers of pleaſure more than lovers of God.</hi> 2 Tim. iii.4. Let the reader apply this to his own heart, and aſk, "Have I loved the Lord with all my heart, with all my ſoul, and with all my ſtrength?" Surely he has not. This view of human nature calls for deep humiliation. Not to love God is to be deſtitute of a pure fountain of happineſs, and to be expoſed to the awful pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of death, annexed to the law of our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign. Glory be to God, that GRACE has reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what NATURE loſt! Therefore,</p>
               <p n="2">II. God claims the affections of his people from the principle of their ADOPTION to HIMSELF in CHRIST JESUS flowing from the good pleaſure of his will. Eph. i.5. This, though unintelligible to nature, is the grand theme of revelation, and is the only way in which the depraved ſinner can be brought to love the Lord with delight. It was the act of the FATHER to adopt; JESUS engaged to

aſſume our nature, bear our ſins, magnify the law of love which we had violated, atone for ſin by the ſhedding of his blood, and prove our adoption in HIMSELF worthy the attributes of JEHOVAH. The SPIRIT of ADOPTION, in the fulneſs of time, is ſent into the conſcience of a redeemed ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſhews him his condemnation for ſin, teſtifies of Chriſt as a complete Saviour, ſheds abroad the love of God in his heart, and enables him to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and enjoy God as his father. Gal. iv. 4—6. Rom. v. 5. How different is the ſtate and ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of ſuch a man to what they were! The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of his heart is ſlain; he feels the force of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation to God, and enjoys peace in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; he neither boaſts of loving God upon the principles of nature, nor cavils at adopting grace, but exults in the everlaſting, diſtinguiſhing love of FATHER, SON, and SPIRIT to him; by which he is brought to know and feel the ſweets of loving God. He that enjoys but the ſmalleſt degree of love to God, though he may not to be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite any remarkable circumſtances in his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, is able to tell you that there was a time when he did not know nor love God; and what little he now enjoys is the fruit of great grace. Thus, <hi>we love</hi> GOD <hi>becauſe he firſt loved us,</hi> ſent his SON to die for us, and then gave us his SPIRIT, to
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:031228_0154_0FEB750DC1D14948"/>
unite our hearts in love to himſelf, bearing teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony that unleſs God had thus loved us we never ſhould have been reſtored to enjoy the ſweets of love to him. To this we add,</p>
               <p n="3">III. GOD, as the REDEEMER of his people, has a right to their affections, from their perſonal ſurrender of themſelves to him, as the fruit of his own grace. That heart which reviews its own native wretchedneſs by tranſgreſſion, contemplates the boundleſs love of God in his ſalvation, and is brought nigh, by the blood of CHRIST, to enjoy the ſmiles of the EVERLASTING FATHER, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members that <hi>he is not his own, but bought with a price.</hi> He approaches the Lord by faith and prayer, and adopts the language of David: <hi>Into thine hand I commit my ſpirit, for thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed me, O Lord God of truth.</hi> Pſ. xxxi.5. In the retired chamber, at the water of baptiſm, at the gates of Zion, and at the table of the Lord, the Chriſtian, in lively emotions of heart, reſigns himſelf to be the Lord's for ever: No part of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed truth but he receives in the love of it; no command which dropped from his Saviour's lips, whether for private or public obedience, but is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced with affection; no croſs, no ſuffering, but what he cheerfully welcomes; knowing that the many waters of affliction cannot quench the flame
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:031228_0155_0FEB750FA2C79C38"/>
of his love to God, neither can the floods of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation drown it. Sol. Song viii. 7. For the truth of theſe obſervations I appeal to the ſcriptures, and to the experience of the Chriſtian reader. You have not repented giving your hand and heart to HIM who bought you with his blood. From the principle of your ſurrender to God he addreſſes you, <hi>My ſon, give me thine heart.</hi> Prov. xxiii.26. This claim is founded upon your <hi>ſonſhip,</hi> and is ſupported by God's endearing relation to you as your <hi>father</hi> in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Frequently, in duty and in trial, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and in conſcience, Chriſt addreſſes you in his language to Peter, <hi>Loveſt thou me more than theſe?</hi> John xxi. 15—17. As the High Prieſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the law bore the names of the Hebrew tribes upon his breaſt-plate, ſo Jeſus, the great HIGH PRIEST of our profeſſion, bears his people upon his heart; and by the methods of his grace he makes them to enjoy the comfort of that privilege, and then claims their hearts for himſelf.</p>
               <p>Let us now take theſe three parts of our ſubject, and view them as containing the principles of <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> and <hi>revealed</hi> religion. On the principles of <hi>adopting grace,</hi> the obligation of <hi>nature's law</hi> is not annihilated, but eſtabliſhed. <hi>Grace</hi> reſtores what <hi>nature</hi> loſt by ſin. Though the honours of nature are reſtored by the obedience of Chriſt, and
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:031228_0156_0FEB7511332AE850"/>
our affections claimed by the Lord, remember it is by the diſplay of adopting grace alone. You be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold God not as Creator only, but in the new, eternal relation of your Father in Chriſt. You never can be too well eſtabliſhed in this important truth. Not viewing the believer's love, as flowing from his <hi>adoption,</hi> is the principal cauſe of blend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing law and goſpel, nature and grace, obligation and privilege, together; and, from this almoſt every other error proceeds. By the goſpel your obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is directed into a new channel, and flows from the precious love of Chriſt: you are actuated by new motives, have new ſources opened for your perſeverance in holy obedience, and a ſure and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain proſpect of <hi>receiving the end of your faith, in the final ſalvation of your ſoul.</hi> 1 Pet. i.9.</p>

life, with all its habits, ſeparate, and as diſtinct from <hi>the old body of ſin,</hi> as the ſoul itſelf is from the animal body. Titus iii.5. Eph. ii.1. John iii.6. 1 John iii.9. The <hi>Image</hi> of God is formed upon this <hi>new creature,</hi> in embryo, as much as the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man foetus poſſeſſes all the habits, parts, and paſſions of man. Eph. iv.24. Col. iii.10. Rom. viii.29. Power, unfelt before, is now experienced—a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict commences in the conſcience, between this <hi>new life</hi> and the <hi>body of ſin</hi>—a deſire is produced, accompanied with an ability to turn unto God as the fountain of mercy, and to enjoy the light, the exerciſe, and the pleaſures, connected with a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſtate of exiſtence. Pſ. cxvi.4. Acts ix.6.</p>
               <p>CONVERSION is the ſpiritual deliverance of a ſoul from a ſtate of regeneration, and is therefore called a birth. John iii.3—5. It is the motion of the living ſoul turning to God; and the exertion of ſpiritual life embracing God, as he is revealed in the ſcriptures, as the believer's happy portion in Chriſt Jeſus, as much as by natural inſtinct the new-born infant applies for ſuſtenance to its mother's breaſt. Jer. xxxi.18. Sam. iii.24. Now, the Image of God is diſplayed in obedience; and life becomes ſenſibly evident in the exerciſe of all its faculties. Gal. v.22. Therefore, he that is <hi>regenerated</hi> ſhall, in due time, be <hi>converted</hi> to a life of happineſs in
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:031228_0160_0FEB751E0B9BF838"/>
God; for God cannot have a <hi>ſtill-born</hi> child; <hi>his work is perfect.</hi> Deut. xxxii.4. Eccl. xi.5.</p>
               <p>To theſe obſervations may be added—In REGE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NERATION the ſinner is <hi>paſſive</hi>; in CONVERSION he is <hi>active.</hi> REGENERATION is, by the ſecret operation of God's holy ſpirit, <hi>alone</hi>; CONVER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SION is enjoyed by the ſame Spirit, through the <hi>mean</hi> of the word of truth. REGENERATION is <hi>once,</hi> and <hi>for ever</hi>; CONVERSION is frequently <hi>neceſſary.</hi> Luke xxii. 32. James v.19. Let no man think of <hi>converſion,</hi> until he be firſt <hi>regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated:</hi> Life muſt be given before life can either be exerciſed or enjoyed. Matt. xviii.3. This great work, of <hi>regeneration</hi> and <hi>converſion,</hi> flows from the everlaſting Love of the FATHER, through the Perſon of his SON CHRIST JESUS; and is produced in the ſoul of guilty man, by the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, inviſible operations of the HOLY GHOST.

               <p>MRS. Mary Gurnee, now of New-York, was a perſon, like too many others, who lived a life of diſobedience, without the knowledge of God, or hope in Chriſt. Immediately on the delivery of her fourth child, it was ſeized with violent fits; and as it lay at its mother's ſide, with its eyes darted upward and its hands clenched, the mother, while beholding the child's agony, ſaid, <hi>Can it be pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</hi> No, thought ſhe, it has no ſin of its own to pray for.

                  <p>To make and receive viſits are highly neceſſary for young perſons, when properly ſelect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and virtuouſly conducted: nor do I wiſh, my daughter, that, on your return from the boarding-ſchool, you ſhould find a priſon in your father's houſe. Mrs. Gay's mode of introducing her daughters into life may make them fine ladies, but cannot make them good wives or valuable mothers; nor can ſuch a domeſtic education, if ſuch it may be called, promiſe any real benefits to ſociety.— Your expectations, like the young ladies you juſt named, may be placed upon the gift of a fortune by your father: but, my child, Providence, by va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious viciffitudes, may deprive your parent of an ability to gratify you. In ſuch a caſe, it will be my ambition, that you be miſtreſs of that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, prudence, and induſtry, that may recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend you to public attention. A man may ſpend a woman's fortune; but her domeſtic accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments will ever remain a valuable acquiſition to herſelf and to her family.</p>

obſerve the neceſſary preparations, mark every procedure, examine the nature and qualities of every article for the table—the manner and the time of dreſſing;—nor ſtand as ſpectator only; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your ability put your hand to the paſte, the jellies, or the ſoups, that on any neglect or change of ſervants, you may gratify your father's table with a ſupply.—Should any tradeſmen enter the kitchen, while you are preſent, conduct towards them with all courteſy, leaſt they ſhould imagine pride to have been your acquiſition at the boarding-ſchool.

O! let the recollection of that rich plenitude of goodneſs, hitherto attendant on my path, prompt me to advance; for as my day, my ſtrength ſhall be.

Preſerved through the dangers of the night, to behold another riſing ſun, what gratitude is due to my almighty Lord! O! let them deeply impreſs my heart, and prompt my ſoul afreſh to walk with God. Come, bleſſed Saviour; whatever may now await my ſteps, do thou afford thy friendly aid, and grant thy ſweeteſt ſmiles! Truſting to myſelf, I ſhall ſurely err, wander from thy embraces, and deeply wound my heart. Ten thouſand ſnares await without, while ten thouſand greater evils lurk within my breaſt, to tempt my feet in paths of guilt. O thou Keeper of Iſrael! into thine arms I commit my ſoul.

Thus will I lay me down in peace, for thou, Lord, canſt make me dwell in ſafety. Thou ſhalt draw the curtains of thy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence around my bed, and give thine holy angels charge concerning me. If my bed ſhould prove my tomb, may I ariſe to a better morning, and meet thee in the ſkies! If ſpared to tread again the thorny path of life, may I honour thy gracious Name, and wait the appointed hour, until my change ſhall come. Even ſo, bleſſed Saviour! amen.</p>

                     </gap>iel. It differs, however, from the common dog in the length, denſe diſpoſition, and ſoftneſs of the hairs, eſpecially thoſe about its tail, which is buſhy, and much admired by the animal itſelf, and in cold weather wrapped round his noſe; and in its ſmell, which is peculiarly rank and offenſive. It is ſaid,
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:031228_0179_0FEB755D0AB0CD18"/>
that the fox makes uſe of its urine, which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably foeted, to force the cleanly badger from its habitation, and takes poſſeſſion of it for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Its uſual colour is a reddiſh tawny, though it is ſometimes found white, and ſometimes black. Its manner of digging itſelf a hole in the earth is alſo a cuſtom wholly different from all the dog kind; and it is far from the tameneſs of that ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, being with difficulty made to loſe its fierceneſs. Of all animals the fox has the moſt ſignificant <hi>eye,</hi> by which it expreſſes every paſſion of love, fear, hatred, &amp;c. The fox is a crafty, lively, libidinous animal; it breeds only once a year, unleſs ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident befals its firſt litter, and brings four or five young, which, like puppies, are born blind. They are diſtinguiſhed by different names: the <hi>greyhound fox</hi> is the largeſt, talleſt, and boldeſt, and will attack a grown ſheep or wether: the <hi>maſtiff fox</hi> is leſs, but more ſtrongly built: the <hi>cur fox</hi> is the leaſt, lurks about hedges and out-houſes, and is the moſt pernicious to the feathered tribe. The firſt of theſe has a white tip to the tail; the laſt a black. The ſkin of this animal is furniſhed with a ſoft and warm fur, which is frequently uſed to make muffs, &amp;c. The fox in the firſt year is called a <hi>cub</hi>; in the ſecond a <hi>fox</hi>; and afterwards an <hi>old fox.</hi> It is a beaſt of chace, uſually very prejudicial to the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman,
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:031228_0180_0FEB755E9582CE30"/>
by taking away and deſtroying his lambs, geeſe, and poultry; but in vineyards he commits the greateſt devaſtation, by eating the grapes and deſtroying the vines. His ſagacity and genius for ſtratagem is peculiarly obſervable in his plunders. He is fond of honey; and as the waſps and bees faſten on his ſkin, he either drowns them in water, or cruſhes them to death by rolling on the ground, till they are forced to leave him in unmoleſted poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of their cells. The very fretful porcupine, in the expanſion of its prickles, he wearies out, by his artful and teazing tricks, and then kills and eats him. When pinched with hunger, he indiſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately feeds on quadrupeds, fowls, fiſhes, and veget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables; nothing comes amiſs to him. The common way to catch him is by gins, which being baited, and a train made by drawing raw fleſh acroſs his uſual paths or haunts to the gin, it proves an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement to lure him to the place of deſtruction. He is ſometimes taken by hunting, of which ſport the dogs are extremely fond, though it often proves very offenſive to the noſe of the huntſman. This creature, on being purſued, ſhews aſtoniſhing powers of running, turning, winding, fighting, and eluding the hounds, often urining upon his tale, to ſtrike his purſuers in the face; and when he finds himſelf without farther reſource, he boldly faces

Yet, infinitely more remarkable, and which claims our higheſt aſtoniſhment, JESUS, the SON OF GOD, whoſe heart was replete with love, and whoſe hands were filled with beneficence to periſhing men, that the ADORABLE LORD, PROPRIETOR of heaven and earth, ſo emptied himſelf, and ſubmitted to ſo deep a ſtate of poverty, as to compel him to ſay to the enquiring ſcribe, <hi>The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have neſts; but the Son of Man hath no where to lay his head.</hi> Matt. viii.20 — Ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They walk in craftineſs, uſe good words and fair ſpeeches, whereby they deceive the hearts of the ſimple. Theſe foxes ſhould be <hi>taken</hi>—detected in their firſt efforts—drove from the vineyard; not burned with <hi>fire and faggot,</hi> but <hi>taken</hi> by prayer to that God who can change the <hi>fox</hi> into a <hi>lamb.</hi> Wherever, and as long as God hath a vine of grace in the vineyard of his church, a <hi>cub fox,</hi> a <hi>grown fox,</hi> or an <hi>old fox</hi> will long for the grapes.</p>

               <p>On invitation, I viſited Mrs. Hamilton, with whom I had an acquaintance for ſeveral years: entering her chamber ſhe thus addreſſed me:—<hi>Sir, never was I more happy to ſee any one than your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. This with me is a period of diſtreſs. I ſink faſt into mortality. O what a dark gulph appears before me! My ſoul hath no hope; no, not one ray of light to cheer my paſſage to eternity. The phyſician tells me he can do no more.</hi> Then, ſaid I, you need ſomething to bear you above all that's mortal. <hi>O!</hi> replied ſhe, <hi>I do, I do, indeed! O that I could with Barnwell ſay,</hi> 'I FIND A POWER WITHIN, THAT BEARS MY SOUL ABOVE THE FEARS OF DEATH, AND, SPITE OF CONSCIOUS SHAME AND GUILT, GIVES ME A
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:031228_0191_0FEB7583D2632F10"/>
TASTE OF PLEASURES MORE THAN MORTAL.' G. Barnwell, Act 5. <hi>How many times has that play been recited, while the heart was a ſtranger to the ſubject! But, I feel my need of mercy to bear my guilty ſoul through death, and fit me for the ſkies!</hi> After reciting to her the fulneſs of Chriſt, his ability to ſave, and the conſolations with which, even now, he could bleſs her, I prayed with her, and was about to take my leave, when ſhe graſped my hand, and with flowing tears urged me to repeat my viſit:—<hi>O Sir, who knows—God may make you an inſtrument to ſave my guilty ſoul!</hi> Aſſuring her that ſalvation was alone to be found in Chriſt, and that it was the office of his Spirit to reveal it to her heart, I left her chamber.</p>
               <p>On my ſecond viſit, interrogating her on the ſtate of her mind, ſhe replied, <hi>My mind</hi> 'IS ILL AT EASE.' <hi>O that I had one glimpſe of hope! Darkneſs covers my mind, and I feel more than adamantine hardneſs within my guilty heart. What a dreadful thing is it to be on the precipice of eternity, to know the goſpel, and not to feel it! The religious education I received from my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, who were attendants at the late Dr. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's church in this city, now reproves my ſoul, and covers me with ſhame. Were I reſtored to perfect health, and poſſeſſed the wealth of ten

thouſand globes, with one ſmile from God I would wiſh to depart from this ſcene of woe. Although,</hi> continued ſhe, <hi>my companions who tread the ſtage are not, perhaps, more wicked than others, yet our employ is a path of temptation that precludes almoſt a thought for immortality. Many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent morals are ſet us in the compoſitions we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, but they are diverted from our hearts. We ſeldom enjoy the ſabbath. On a Saturday we often play; fatigued on the ſabbath, we have no ability for devotion, and are frequently obliged to learn for future play. Thus abſorbed, my ſoul has been moſt groſsly neglected. Should I be raiſed again from this bed, having one ſmile from God, I would ſooner beg my bread than tread the ſtage again—Yes, the moſt menial employ ſhall rather fill my days, than I purſue a path ſo big with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row at the end! —I cannot but wiſh, if I ſhould be raiſed to health, as life from the dead, that my future days may be employed in adoration of my deliverer. Yet, for life am I not anxious. Not as I will, but as thou wilt, O bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour! Only grant me one ſmile from Thee, I am content to live or die. Could this heart ariſe to God—could this ſoul enjoy liberty with heaven, I ſhould not fear to die.</hi> Diſcloſing this ſenſibility of mind, I more fully explained to her the fulneſs
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:031228_0193_0FEAF869D73498F8"/>
and freeneſs of ſalvation, in the perſon, blood, and righteouſneſs of the Son of God; to be known and enjoyed only by the teaching of the Holy Spirit;— that ſinners, like herſelf, the vileſt ſinners, ſenſible of their need of mercy, are encouraged, by the promiſes of God, to hope for that invaluable bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. This ſalvation is worthy a God to provide, and neceſſary for a ſinner to receive for everlaſting happineſs.—To this ſhe liſtened with that ſolemn, eager attention, that it may be ſaid, "her ſoul was in her eyes." <hi>Ah!</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>this ſuits my caſe, and encourages my hope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On my next viſit ſhe addreſſed me, <hi>Sir, my mind is as the ocean, after agitated by tempeſt, and caſt into rooling billows, now begins to ſettle into a calm—I feel much compoſed—Numberleſs paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of ſcripture occur to my thoughts; yes, Sir, to my guilt and ſhame I ſpeak it, many promiſes now occur, which have not paſſed my mind for many years, and ſeem to draw my diſcompoſed heart into a calm.</hi>—"What a mercy is it," ſaid I, "that God ſhould reveal to us ſuch promiſes in his word! How ungenerous thoſe who, by ridicule, would deprive us of that ſacred volume! But, my friend, what paſſages have afforded you relief?"— <hi>True, Sir, replied ſhe, were the Bible untrue, or removed from me, what could encourage my
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:031228_0194_0FEB758D624479E8"/>
guilty ſoul that I ſhould meet with a pardon from my Judge! nothing but deep deſpair would hover before my eyes. That paſſage in Lam.</hi> iii. 21, 22. <hi>much encourages me.</hi> THIS I RECALL TO MIND, THEREFORE HAVE I HOPE. IT IS OF THE LORD'S MERCIES THAT WE ARE NOT CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUMED, BECAUSE HIS COMPASSION FAIL NOT. <hi>But particularly Iſa.</hi> i.18. COME NOW AND LET US REASON TOGETHER, SAITH THE LORD; THOUGH YOUR SINS BE AS SCARLET, THEY SHALL BE AS WHITE AS SNOW; THOUGH THEY BE RED LIKE CRIMSON, THEY SHALL BE AS WOOL. <hi>Theſe ſcriptures ſuit my ſtate, and give me ſome proſpect of mercy. The relief they have afforded me theſe forty-eight laſt hours, is indeſcribable. O that Jeſus would grant me one ſmile, however faint; it would be worth more to me than millions of worlds! By thinking upon the parable of the unjuſt judge, who heard the widow's cry, and our Lord's improvement upon it, I am encouraged that he will hear me alſo. You know, Sir, there is a</hi> DOOR, TO HIM THAT KNOCKETH IT SHALL BE OPENED, AND WHOSOEVER SEEKETH, SHALL FIND.</p>
               <p>On my next viſit I found her mind much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſed; the cauſe of which was the recollection of the following circumſtance:—While in the
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:031228_0195_0FEB7590DF060C10"/>
Weſt-Indies, ſhe was perſuaded, by an Epiſcopal clergyman, to receive the Lord's Supper, which, ſaid ſhe, was <hi>without knowledge and faith in Chriſt, or real love to Him</hi>; and which, ſhe concluded, ranked her among thoſe who were guilty of the body and blood of Chriſt. I informed her, that in my early days, through ignorance and perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, I had done ſo myſelf: when I was brought to the knowledge of the Lord, it deeply impreſſed my ſpirits; but, by an application of this ſcripture, THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST CLEANSETH FROM ALL SIN, I enjoyed relief. To this ſhe pauſed, lifted up her eyes to heaven, and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded:—<hi>Could I attain one ray of ſolid hope, enlivened by faith in Chriſt, I would quit the world without a ſigh. At times, I feel my heart expand to Jeſus—I feel I love him in my heart— nay, my ſoul ſeems full of love; but, at other times I feel ſo full of guilt and fear, it bears me down with grief.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On my laſt viſit I found her attended by a Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphian friend, who intimated to Mrs. Hamilton the propriety of her withdrawing, with the nurſe, while ſhe-converſed with me; to whom ſhe replied, <hi>No, you need not go out; I have nothing to ſay that I need be aſhamed of; I have only to tell my need of a Saviour, and there is no ſhame in that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
                  <pb n="191" facs="unknown:031228_0196_0FEB759280B57520"/>
She was ſenſible that her end was approaching. At intervals, ſhe ſaid, <hi>her heart felt a ſecret hope in God, and a warm love to Chriſt; but was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſo much abſorbed by temptation and pain, that none but Chriſt could ſupport her.</hi> Still her earneſt cry was for the ſenſible ſmiles of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, with which, ſhe ſaid, <hi>ſhe could inſtantly reſign her breath.</hi> I told her, neither ſhe, nor I, deſerved a ſmile from God; it was a rich mercy if he made us ſenſible of our guilt, and led us, by faith for ſalvation, to the bleeding croſs of his Son: if this be our caſe, the ſmiles ſhall come by and by. <hi>O!</hi> replied ſhe, <hi>it is at the croſs I reſt, and I muſt wait and knock until the Lord ſhall anſwer.</hi> I prayed with her, and took my final leave.</p>
               <p>Death now made a rapid advance; yet Mrs. Hamilton ſeemed inceſſant in prayer. Her friend informed me, that on aſking her of the ſtate of her mind a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>le before her departure, ſhe replied, <hi>I am ſtill ſeeking—ſtill knocking!</hi> Then lifting up her eyes to heaven, and claſping her hands, in ſolemn, powerful accents ſhe exclaimed, <hi>My God! my God! am I forſaken? Then I will rap yet the harder!</hi> Agonizing under diſſolving nature, ſhe continued in ſilent prayer, until ſhe cloſed her eyes in death, aged fifty-two years, twenty-ſix of which
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:031228_0197_0FEB7595D182BE08"/>
ſhe had ſpent, to her manifeſt grief, on the deluſive vanities of the ſtage.</p>
               <p>Though Mrs. Hamilton was never chargeable, ſo far as I have ever heard, with a profligate life, nor did ſhe ever intimate this in my converſation with her, yet it was evident, that her entrance and continuance on the ſtage gave her the moſt pungent diſtreſs. The occupation of an <hi>actreſs</hi> ſhe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as dangerous, expoſing to numerous tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and inconſiſtent with a chriſtian profeſſion. —Charity leads us to believe, that ſhe found that <hi>repentance,</hi> carefully ſought with tears, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced the virtue of the blood of Chriſt, which <hi>cleanſeth from all ſin.</hi>

nature and grace; fleſh and ſpirit; the old man and the new. Although the experience of the heart admits of different degrees of combat and ſenſibility, light and darkneſs, pleaſure and pain, yet there can be no chriſtian, as ſuch, without ſome meaſure of experience; it is abſolutely inſeparable from his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence as a believer, either as a babe, a young man, or a father, in Chriſt. A ſubject, therefore, of this magnitude is worthy a place in this publication, and demands the moſt ſerious attention of our nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous readers.</p>
               <p>The AUTHOR of chriſtian experience is the Spirit of God. This ſentiment our Lord taught in his diſcourſe to the Jews: <hi>He that believeth on me, out of his belly ſhall flow rivers of living waters. This ſpake he of the Spirit which they that believe on him ſhould receive.</hi> John vii.38, 39. To the woman of Samaria he explained the ſame truth: <hi>Whoſoever drinketh of the water that I ſhall give him, ſhall never thirſt; but ſhall be in him a well of water ſpringing up into everlaſting life.</hi> John iv.14. This <hi>well</hi> is dug in the ſinner's <hi>Regeneration</hi>; the ſacred <hi>water</hi> ſprings in <hi>Converſion,</hi> flows through every channel of <hi>Obedience,</hi> repleniſhes the heart under the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt ſufferings, and creates thoſe ſublime pleaſures which bear the ſoul above the fears of death, in
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:031228_0200_0FEAF876EE0BD398"/>
proſpect of immortal joys. Nor can we omit citing the great channel of experience which our Lord hath given us under the expreſſive emblem of the <hi>vine and the branches,</hi> the vital ſap of which, the power of the Bleſſed Spirit, produces the buds of deſire, the leaves of profeſſion, the fragrant flowers of comfort, and the richeſt fruit of love to God and man. The experience of God's grace and love, the eſſence of religion, can no more be enjoyed in the breaſt of a ſinner without the Spirit of God, than the branch can bear fruit without a living union with the vine. John xv. 1 — 5. As it was the office and work of CHRIST to make atonement for ſin, by the ſhedding of his blood; ſo it is the office and work of the SPIRIT to bring ſinners into the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and experience of that great ſalvation. For a man to profeſs his faith in the perſon and work of Chriſt, without being able to give a teſtimony of the work of the Spirit upon his heart, is the moſt awful deluſion—<hi>If any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his,</hi> let his profeſſion be as brilliant as it may. Rom. viii.9.</p>
               <p>The STANDARD of experience is the goſpel of Chriſt. As the Holy Ghoſt dictated the authors of the bible, ſo the goſpel, in all its variety, fulneſs and glory, is applied to a believing ſoul <hi>in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the</hi> ſame <hi>Spirit, and of power.</hi>
                  <pb n="196" facs="unknown:031228_0201_0FEAF878A158E938"/>
1 Theſſ. i.5.ii.13. <hi>To the law, and to the teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony; if they ſpeak not according to this word, it is becauſe there is no light in them.</hi> Iſaiah viii.20. It is in the volume of revelation alone that we know how God pardons ſin—how it is our guilty conſcience can have peace with God—how we may walk happily with him—what are the enemies we have to fight againſt—and by what means we are made more than conquerors. It is here alone that we learn the great, the glorious act of JEHOVAH, in adopting his children in Chriſt— what are their features, trials, mercies, duties, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, and ſecurity. A conſiderable part of this ſacred book exhibits, in the moſt lively colours, the EXPERIENCES of God's children, for many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years; and it is moſt certain, that there is no man who has been made a partaker of God's grace, but has found, in the lives of bible ſaints, an exact copy of his own frames, feelings, fears, hopes, and joys. Let the men of grace be of whatever lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, nation, or particular viſible denomination, they may, the pure language of experience which God promiſed to turn to the people of his love, is the ſame, that they may call upon the name of the Lord, and ſerve him with one conſent. God's truth can alone be the criterion of God's work. That experience which flows from Chriſt, and reſts upon
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:031228_0202_0FEB759E05963CA0"/>
his word, will ſatisfy, and abide; while that which is derived from outward means only, and exiſts in mere frames, fits and paſſions, ſhall vaniſh as the ſmoke, or prove as the morning cloud and as the early dew which paſſeth away. Hoſea vi.4. There were ſome in the church at Corinth, and ſuch will be found in every church, who neglected the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of the goſpel, and eſtimated their ſtate by the feelings, gifts, and experiences of each other. <hi>We dare not make ourſelves of the number, or compare ourſelves with ſome, that commend themſelves: but they, meaſuring themſelves by themſelves, and comparing themſelves amongſt themſelves, are not wiſe.</hi> 2 Cor. x.12. If he that truſteth in his own heart is a fool, equally ſo muſt he be that truſts in another. Let us derive pleaſure from reciting our experiences to each other; but, let the word of the Lord be the light unto our feet, and a lamp unto our path, to aſcertain the perfection of our expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and the ſafety of our ſtate.</p>
               <p>The PROGRESS of experience is, in ſcripture, called, <hi>growing in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt</hi>; 2 Pet. iii.18. and, <hi>a growing up into Chriſt in all things.</hi> Eph. iv.15. It is analogous to he advance of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable nature; <hi>firſt the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.</hi> Mark iv.28. And,

to the advance of humanity—<hi>babe, youth, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, old age</hi>; with all the paſſions, activity, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, virtues, and advantages of each ſtage. 1 John ii.13, 14. Theſe productions of nature, like the growth of the ſoul in grace, are gradual and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible, and only to be aſcertained by their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods, light, ſtrength, and virtue. The firſt efforts of grace are deſcribed as <hi>ſeeing men as trees walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> Mark viii.24. its advance and completion <hi>to the unity of the faith, the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt.</hi> Eph. iv.16. The prophet Ezekiel gives us a moſt delightful view of this ſubject, in his deſcription of the flowing of the water that iſſued out from under the threſhold of the houſe of the Lord; the depths of which were, to <hi>the ancles—the knees— the loins—and waters to ſwim in, a river that could not be paſſed over.</hi> Ezekiel xlvii.1—5. In the advance of experience, we cannot but perceive that faith, hope, love, repentance, meekneſs, long-ſuffering, and truth, as derived from Chriſt, oppoſe the baneful powers of unbelief, deſpair, hatred, pride, malice, and every other evil that ariſes from the old body of ſin that lodges within the ſoul. By this conflict the chriſtian is led more deeply to know and to loath the vileneſs of ſin, pants after greater
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:031228_0204_0FEB75A2EC266DE0"/>
conformity to Chriſt, and cleaves unto the Lord with full purpoſe of heart. The more powerfully the ſnares of the world and ſatan ſurround him, the more ardently he breathes for communion with God. The more ſenſibly he feels his own imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, the more he cries for the enjoyment of the fulneſs of Jeſus, and rejoices in him as the great High Prieſt, who hath made atonement, and bears the iniquities of our moſt holy things. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict Paul felt, and hath left us a copy of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in the ſeventh chapter of the Romans. He that is a partaker of the ſame grace, can, more or leſs, adopt his language in the fifth chapter— <hi>Therefore, being juſtified, by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; by whom alſo we have acceſs by faith into this grace wherein we ſtand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. And not only ſo, but we glory in tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation alſo, knowing that tribulation worketh pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and patience experience, and experience hope; and hope maketh not aſhamed, becauſe the love of God is ſhed abroad in our hearts, by the Holy Ghoſt, which is given unto us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The MEANS by which experience is advanced are neceſſary to be underſtood. As vegetable nature proſpers by the rays of the ſun, and the rains from above, ſo the chriſtian is indebted to the beams
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:031228_0205_0FEB75A475044BD0"/>
of Chriſt, the glorious Son of Righteouſneſs, and to the conſtant influences of the Bleſſed Spirit.— As the body depends upon the air in which we breathe for the comforts, uſe, and exertions of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal life, ſo the ſoul is inceſſantly dependant on the Spirit of God for all the ſupport, conſolation, and activity, connected with a life of faith on Chriſt. As the advance of animal nature is promoted by activity and induſtry, ſo the chriſtian finds an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite variety of duties, perſonal and relative, in the world, in the cloſet, in the family, and in the church; the performance of which is connected with his hope in God, and his love to his Saviour. But, perhaps, experience is more rapidly advanced, and more ſtrongly rooted, in the furnace of afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It was in this furnace that the faith of the primitive chriſtians was found to be more precious than gold that periſheth. 1 Pet. i.7. Never did a believer paſs through ſuffering, but, either in it or after it, he was convinced that he could not have done without it. The Lord made Joſeph fruitful in the land of his affliction. Geneſis xli.52. And in all the Lord's diſpenſations to his people, he promotes their humility, increaſes their faith, and gives them the greater enjoyment of his preſence. It is very obſervable, that the annual ſeaſon that ripens the corn in the ear, is moſt attended with
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:031228_0206_0FEB75A7C02F4590"/>
thunder, lightning, ſtorm, and tempeſt; and, many excellent chriſtians have found, that the nearer they advanced to the cloſe of life, temptations and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions increaſed upon them: and thus, as an oar of wheat ripe for the ſickle, he bows his head in humility, ſelf-denial, and obedience; while the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of his heart is, Come, Lord Jeſus, come quickly!</p>
               <p>To conclude this eſſay: let the profeſſor of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion be perſuaded to try his experience by the teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony of the goſpel. Pſm. cxxxix.23, 24.—Let not the weak in faith be diſcouraged: although a <hi>babe</hi> in grace, be thankful for what you enjoy, and remember, God giveth more grace. James iv.6.— Let thoſe who have good experience of pardon, peace and love in God, be ready to give a reaſon of the hope that is in him with meekneſs and fear; proving the genuineneſs of his profeſſion by the holineſs of his life. Matt. v.16.—And, let thoſe who advance to the laſt ſtage of life know, that God will not forſake the work of his own hand; but that you ſhall come to the grave in a full age, like a ſhock of corn cometh in in its ſeaſon. Job v.27.</p>

               <head>THE RELIEF.</head>
               <p>A CLERGYMAN of the ſtate of New-York, not many years ſince, through a miſapprehenſion of a leading member, was precipitately deprived of his pulpit, which involved a large family in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity. At ſupper, the good man had the pain of beholding the laſt morſel of bread placed upon the table, without the leaſt means or proſpect of a ſupply for his children's breakfaſt. His wife, full of grief, with her children, retired to her bed. The miniſter choſe to ſet up and employ his dark hours in prayer, and in reading the promiſes of God. Some ſecret hope of ſupply pervaded his breaſt; but when, how, what, whence, or by whom, he knew not. He retired to reſt, and in the morning appeared with his family, and performed the duty of prayer. It being the depth of winter, and a little fire upon the hearth, probably to keep the poor children's expectations alive, that breakfaſt ſhould ſoon be enjoyed, he deſired his wife to hang on the kettle, and ſpread the cloth upon the table.—The kettle boiled—the children cried for bread: the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted father, ſtanding before the fire, felt thoſe emotions of heart unknown to thoſe whoſe tables are repleniſhed with affluence. While in this

painful ſtate, ſome one knocked at the door— en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered—paſſed the compliments of the morning, and was about to leave the room, when he ſtepped back and delivered a letter into the miniſter's hand. When the gentleman was gone the letter was opened, and, to the miniſter's aſtoniſhment, it contained a FOUR POUNDS BANK BILL, with a deſire of acceptance. So manifeſt an interpoſition of Divine goodneſs could not but be received with gratitude and joy; and, ſhould be a leſſon to others to truſt in that Saviour who hath ſaid, <hi>Verily thou ſhalt be fed.</hi> Pſm. xxxvii.3. <hi>I will never leave thee, nor forſake thee.</hi> Heb. xiii.5.</p>
               <p>This remarkable occurrence being communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the EDITOR, who, having an intimacy with the gentleman ſaid to be the hand that offered the ſeaſonable relief, was determined, the next time he made him a viſit, to introduce the ſubject, and, if poſſible, to know the reaſon that induced the generous action. The ſtory was told—the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman diſcovered a modeſt bluſh, which evinced the tenderneſs of his heart. On interrogation, he ſaid "He had frequently heard that miniſter: on a certain morning he was diſpoſed for a walk; thought, in the ſeverity of the winter ſeaſon a trifle might be of ſervice, as fuel was high; felt a kind of neceſſity to incloſe the money in a letter; went

to the houſe; found the family adjuſted as was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed; delivered the paper and retired; but knew not of the extreme neceſſity of the miniſter and his family until this moment."</p>
               <p>The addreſs made by the gentleman's amiable ſiſter, preſent in the parlour, ſhall ſerve as an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of this narrative. "Brother, learn from this never to withhold your hand from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving another, when you feel a dictate in your own breaſt; as this inſtance muſt convince you, it was from God, and greater benefit conveyed than ever you intended to beſtow."</p>

hath, however, pleaſed the Almighty to draw a kind of veil to conceal from man the certain knowledge of thoſe various and ſucceſſive events of time, the immediate proſpect of which would cruſh the ſoul in deep deſpair.

Did ſuch fore-knowledge pervade
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:031228_0211_0FEB75B9F0C4C590"/>
the mind of man, childhood and youth would bear the ſorrows of old age; the powers of genius would fail; art be unimproved; and nature herſelf unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored. How little does the buſy worldling reflect on his obligation to infinite goodneſs, for his ability to perform the duties of his ſtation, and that the uncertainty of future events demands his conſtant dependence upon the pleaſure of the Almighty! Thoſe whoſe minds are directed to the Supreme, know, that the providence of God is a myſtery to man in all ages. It is as the bud which gradually and imperceptibly ariſes into flower, and then emits its richeſt fragrance. It is a ſecond bible; every day, and every moment, like the ſeveral leaves of the ſacred volume, preſenting ſomething new and aſtoniſhing to the intelligent obſerver.</p>
               <p>If the obſervations now made, as they relate to men in common life, be pronounced juſt, I may venture to add, that the wiſdom and goodneſs of God, in withholding the knowledge of future events, is more highly eſteemed by the real Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian than by thoſe whoſe habit of diſſipation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives them of an ability to obſerve the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Almighty. If God, in the early part of the Chriſtian's life, had uncovered the great deep of the heart; expoſed the ſecret evils that lodge within it; or had given the good man a view of
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:031228_0212_0FEB75BD29B327D8"/>
the imperfections, diſappointments, temptations, croſſes, and ſorrows that awaited him, how would his ſoul have trembled at the awful proſpect, and bowed himſelf to the very duſt of the earth! The Chriſtian ſometimes aſcends the mount of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation; ſurveys the <hi>map</hi> of his paſt <hi>experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>; remembers the way which the Lord his God hath led him; and in the review his ſoul is filled with profound aſtoniſhment! So many winding, thorny paths,—ſeas of tribulation,—dreary deſerts, —mountains of difficulty,—valleys of humiliation! <hi>My God!</hi> ſays he, and drops the ſilent tear, <hi>can I have paſſed through ſuch ways as theſe? Is it poſſible! Surely had I known the path, my feet had never made the choice. It was thou, my God, my Saviour, and my Guide, that ſafely brought me through; nor can I now diſtruſt thy future care. Secure beneath thy ſacred wings I ſhall paſs my fleeting days; finiſh my courſe with joy; walk through the ſhades of death, and mount to Zion's hill above, to celebrate thy praiſe!</hi>

<pb n="211" facs="unknown:031228_0216_0FEB75C9DC52B3B0"/>
and lead the ſoul with profoundeſt rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to adore the infinite, the wiſe, the glorious Supreme! But, of all theſe, how is our ſight gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, and our ſenſes regaled, while paſſing through the FLOWERY NATIONS? Here nature wears her bright attire, pours forth her wonders, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands our higheſt praiſe. From this rich, inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtible profuſion of Nature's garden, let us at leaſt ſelect the ROSE of SHARON, ſurvey its beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and collect its ſweets.</p>
               <p>The ROSE, <hi>roſa,</hi> is acknowledged a genus of the polygamia order, belonging to the icoſandria claſs of plants. The ſorts of roſes are very nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. Turnefort reckons no leſs than fifty-three, and botaniſts find it very difficult to determine with accuracy, which are ſpecies, and which are varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as well as which are varieties of the reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſpecies. On this account, Linnaeus, and ſome other eminent authors, are inclined to think, that there is only one real ſpecies of roſe, which is the <hi>roſa canina,</hi> or dog-roſe of the hedge, and that all the other ſorts are accidental varieties of it. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, according to the preſent Linnaean arrangement they ſtand divided into fourteen ſuppoſed ſpecies, each comprehending ſome varieties, which in ſome ſorts are but few, others numerous.</p>
               <p>The roſe we admire is <hi>the roſe of Sharon,</hi> the
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:031228_0217_0FEB75D04ABD92A0"/>
moſt delightful in its colours, and the richeſt in its fragrance. This invites our choice, becauſe it is an emblem of Immanuel's glory, and endears our hearts to him. Sol. Songs ii.1.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The beauty of its colours, <hi>red</hi> and <hi>white,</hi> expreſſive theſe of the glory of the God-head, and the ſorrows of the humanity of Chriſt. <hi>My be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,</hi> ſaid the church, <hi>is white and ruddy.</hi> Sol. Songs v.10. WHITE is properly no colour at all, but a compoſition of all colours; the light of the ſun, therefore, ſaid Sir Iſaac Newton, is only white, becauſe conſiſting of all colours: neither is BLACK, its oppoſite, a colour, but a deprivation of all colours, therefore the proper emblem of wretchedneſs and death. Apply theſe obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the ſcripture teſtimony of Jehovah: <hi>God is light, and in him is no darkneſs at all,</hi> 1 John i.5. demonſtrative this of that underived, ſelf-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtent purity, happineſs, truth, love, and glory, which, without the ſhadow of variation, diſorder, and imperfection, is eſſential to Deity. That this excellence, peculiar to Jehovah, is aſcribed to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, the current of ſcripture evinces. Aaron, the High Prieſt, was to wear a pure linen garment un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ephod, to repreſent the inviſible divinity under the humanity. Daniel ſaw the Meſſiah, <hi>the Ancient of days,</hi> with a <hi>garment white as ſnow.</hi>
                  <pb n="213" facs="unknown:031228_0218_0FEB75D230749E08"/>
Dan. vii.9. When Jeſus was transfigured upon mount Tabor, <hi>his raiment was white as the light; more than any fuller on earth could make them.</hi> Mark ix.3. Thus, Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and only</hi> POTENTATE, <hi>the</hi> KING <hi>of</hi> KINGS, <hi>and</hi> LORD <hi>of</hi> LORDS; <hi>who not only hath immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality dwelling in the</hi> LIGHT, <hi>which no man can approach unto; whom,</hi> in his divinity, <hi>no man hath ſeen, nor can ſee, is worthy of honour and power everlaſting.</hi> 1 Tim. vi.15, 16. Let us now contemplate the other colour that forms this beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful roſe. This is to exhibit the quality of the human body, generally acknowledged to be formed by the Almighty, from a ſort of red earth. Nor does it leſs intimate thoſe ſorrows which mankind experience as the fruit of diſobedience. But, as applied to Chriſt, denotes the greatneſs of his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and his bloody death, as the redeemer of ſinners. Iſaiah beheld Meſſiah, <hi>red in his appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, and whoſe garment was like him that tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the wine-fat.</hi> lxiii.2. In the days of his fleſh, ſufferings attended his path, and, in Gathſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, his ſorrows were ſuch that produced ſtrong cries and tears, while ſweat and blood iſſued from every vein, and fell down to the ground. His death exhibited the moſt affecting ſcene; ſo great the ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of his body by crucifixion; ſo extreme the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:031228_0219_0FEB75D3C68C7F98"/>
of his ſoul preſſed with the weight of divine judgment for our ſins, that nature herſelf, by a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural darkneſs, drew a veil over the diſtreſſed ſufferer! In his exalted ſtate, he is ſeen by the glorified throng, as <hi>a Lamb that had been ſlain.</hi> John beheld this adored Lord, wearing <hi>a name written that no man knew but himſelf; and he was clothed with a veſture dipped in blood.</hi> Rev. xix.12, 13. Can we read theſe ſcriptures with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a conviction of the eternal power and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of Chriſt? Can we turn the ſacred page without being deeply affected with the life and death of Jeſus, as a man of ſorrows, and acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with griefs? Impoſſible! Caſt then your eyes upon THE ROSE OF SHARON, produced, may I ſay, on purpoſe to exhibit by its colour the ſame truth which revelation teaches. Let us look ſtill cloſer, and while the white and the red, pure in themſelves, exhibit the perfection of Nature's pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; obſerve how delicately fine the union between the two; this to teach us the <hi>great myſtery of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, God manifeſt in the fleſh.</hi> A union this that conſtitutes the character of Chriſt as MEDI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ATOR; lays the foundation of our pardon, and is the ſtrong baſis of our communion with God, perſeverence through life, ſupport in death, and hope of a glorious immortality!</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="215" facs="unknown:031228_0220_0FEB75D6EB3C6F88"/>2. The odoriferous <hi>ſcent</hi> of the Roſe of Sharon aſſiſts us to contemplate the precious virtues of the Lord of glory. How richly does this ſweet roſe pour forth its fragrance to gratify the ſenſe! yet more richly does Jeſus diſplay the glories of his name; opens the unbounded love of his heart; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a full pardon bought with his moſt precious blood; proclaims, by his goſpel, the inconceivable fulneſs of his grace as an all-ſufficient ſupply for our ſupport, comfort, perſeverance, ſanctification, and everlaſting felicity. Jeſus, the Roſe of Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, is ever precious to them that believe; yet there are ſpecial ſeaſons when his delights are more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly enjoyed. David exclaimed, <hi>Though I walk in the midſt of trouble, thou wilt revive me.</hi> Pſm. cxxxviii.7. And thouſands in every age have enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more ſenſible comforts in Chriſt, at a period of affliction, than ever they experienced in a time of eaſe and affluence. <hi>For as the ſufferings of Chriſt abound in us, ſo our conſolation alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundeth by Chriſt.</hi> When the church attends the ſupper of the Lord, how often does the Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er gladden their hearts with the light of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, while communion, with bread and wine, yields the richeſt delight! But, however precious and delightful the Roſe of Sharon may be to us in our paſſage through life, in the article of de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="216" facs="unknown:031228_0221_0FEB75DD434C48B8"/>
ſuperior enjoyments are conferred. <hi>Precious in the ſight of the Lord is the death of his ſaints.</hi> When fleſh and heart fail; when the ſweets of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man friendſhip are no longer to be enjoyed; when the richeſt cordials and the moſt delicious produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of nature ceaſe to gratify the taſte, and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute upon the lips, then for the ſoul to be regaled with the ſmiles of Jeſus, the delightful Roſe of Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, how great is the bleſſing! Sheltered beneath Immanuel's wings, and ſweetly ſolaced with his love, how many thouſands have launched into eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with a ſmile, and hailed the promiſed crown of life!</p>
               <p n="3">3. The medicinal virtues of the roſe affords us further aid to explore the excellence of the Lord Chriſt. There is not a more rich perfume than the eſſence of roſes. The roſe diſtilled with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter yields a ſmall portion of a butyraceous oil, whoſe flavour exactly reſembles that of the roſe itſelf. This oil, and the diſtilled water, are very uſeful and agreeable cordials. A conſerve of ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes is of various uſes, particularly in relieving im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections attending the eye, and of meliorating and removing complaints, unneceſſary now to be mentioned.</p>
               <p>But whence theſe medicinal virtues of the roſe? Do they flow while blooming in the field? No:
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:031228_0222_0FEB75DECD0F5688"/>
this delightful flower muſt be cut down, caſt into a Still, and undergo the ſeverity of fire, before its eſſence can be enjoyed. Solemn thought this, when applied to Chriſt, the Roſe of Sharon! He appeared in all the perfection of humanity, and diſplayed the glory of divinity thirty-three years; then was cut down by death, the inſtrument of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, caſt into the grave, ſuſtained the fire of divine anger againſt ſin, and thus, as the Redeemer of his people, yielded the virtues of his ſacrifice, for their pardon, peace, and happineſs in God. There is no virtue in the roſe to regale the fainting ſpirits, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the waſted frame, heal the obſtructed ſight, or cure the burning fever, but what there are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely greater virtues in a crucified Jeſus, to cure ſimilar, nay, every diſorder poſſible incident to the ſoul of man. Thouſands in every age, under the moſt complicated mental evils, have received with joy the virtues of the Roſe of Sharon; and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands ſtill, and thouſands more, ſhall enjoy its ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred ſweets and triumph in its praiſe!</p>
               <p n="4">4. SHARON, (that is, <hi>a plain or field</hi>) the native ſoil of the lovely roſe, will help us to conceive a few more thoughts of the adored Redeemer. This plain of Sharon was a delightful, fertile place, where David f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

world by his goſpel; or his church, where he dwells, conducts his ſheep, diſplays his glory, heals the ſick, and comforts the ſorrowful. By the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord, this wilderneſs, ſolitary place of our earthly pilgrimage, dreary as the deſert, is made to bloſſom as the roſe. Iſaiah xxxv.1, 2. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his love is experienced, there is that ſacred joy which can only be exceeded by drinking at the fountain head in glory!</p>
               <p>As the Roſe grew upon Sharon's plain, free for all who had eyes to ſee, ſenſe to ſmell, or hands to embrace, ſo Jeſus is freely and fully publiſhed in his goſpel. <hi>Whoſoever will, let him come, and him that cometh unto me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> But, thoſe who have neither eyes to ſee, nor ſenſe to ſmell, paſs by the Roſe of Sharon, treat it with diſdain, and attempt to cruſh it under foot.</p>
               <p n="5">5. No Roſe without its Thorn; no, not even the Roſe of Sharon! Who takes Chriſt muſt take the croſs too. <hi>If any man will be my diſciple, let him deny himſelf, take up his croſs, and follow me.</hi> If any man will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, he muſt ſuffer perſecution. When men without grace take Jeſus, the Roſe of Sharon, in the hand of mere profeſſion, the thorn of perſecution makes them throw away the roſe, and ſeek for other flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to gratify their carnal taſte; but, when men of
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:031228_0224_0FEB75E38E36D6F8"/>
grace, by the hand of faith, pluck this precious flower, the thorn of ſuffering makes them graſp the harder, enjoy its ſweets more ſweetly, and dare to ſtand though blood itſelf ſhould flow.</p>

                  <l>In Sharon's lovely rose</l>
                  <l>Immortal beauties shine;</l>

               <head>THE AFFLICTED MOTHER.</head>
               <p>A PIOUS gentleman and his wife, poſſeſſed of an agreeable fortune, were favoured with a ſon and two daughters. The mother fixed her atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion inordinately upon her children, and gradually declined in the warmth of her affections to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo hard is it for us to poſſeſs the natural enjoyments of life, and yet to reſerve the heart for God! God, however, is a jealous God to them who are the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of his love; and, according to his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, he viſits their iniquities with a rod. Pſm. lxxxix.32. God ſaid to Hoſea, <hi>Ephraim is joined
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:031228_0225_0FEB75E9E7AFAB00"/>
unto idols, let him alone.</hi> Hoſea iv.17. This woman idolized her children, and God convinced her of her folly. Her youngeſt child was ſeized with a fever, lay a few days, and died. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaving providence, inſtead of impreſſing her mind with a ſenſe of the uncertainty of human enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and, that God alone was the centre of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, ſhe called his judgments in queſtion, and murmured at his hand. A few months after this, her other daughter, after affording her mother great pleaſure by her prattle in the parlour, entered the garden, walked on the edge of a fine fiſh-pond, ſlipped in, and was drowned, before relief could be obtained. The unfortunate mother was now fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with diſtraction; ſullen grief ſucceeded; at length, by temptation, ſhe highly reflected on the conduct of the Almighty, and gradually declined in her attendance on the public duties of religion. Her ſon, now her only child, a remarkably pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing youth, had juſt finiſhed his education, and returned from the boarding-ſchool—went out one morning with his gun for ſport, in company with a neighbouring gentleman; arriving at a fence, reſted their guns; the youth, while in converſation, placed his hand, and reclined his head upon the mouth of the barrel; accidentally, by the motion of his foot, he touched the trigger, and inſtantly the

contents of the piece was diſcharged through his brain. In this affecting ſtate he was conveyed to his parents; but what pen is able to recite the dreadful emotion of their hearts on the melancholy ſight! What ſubmiſſion might poſſeſs the father's breaſt, is uncertain; but the unhappy mother, while ſurrounded with weeping friends, in the midſt of her agonies unguardedly exclaimed, <hi>God has taken away my children, and what can he now do more?</hi> God ſoon convinced her that he could do more. Her huſband caught a violent cold, a conſumption enſued, and death received him to his gloomy ſhades. When the information of his death was given to his wife, ſhe fainted. On her recovery, ſhe fell upon her knees, the tears guſhed from her eyes, and with accents indeſcribable, ſhe exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, "Lord, thou haſt at length bowed my rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious heart! Thou haſt ſtripped me of my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and my huſband is no more; here, Lord, take my heart—never more ſuffer a creature, however dear, to remove it from thyſelf. I own thy judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments juſt, and aſk the comforts of thy love!</p>
               <p>This woman ſurvived ſeveral years, and lived an example of real piety.

               <p>THAT a perſon who, through grace, has enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the rich manifeſtations of a Saviour's ſmiles, and hath been numbered with Chriſt's viſible flock, may be liable to fall into temptation, loſe the bloom of his profeſſion, and the comforts of his ſoul, for a ſeaſon, is a truth ſo evident in the ſcriptures, and ſo convicting in the conſcience, as at once demands our aſſent and our tears. Although it be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely impoſſible to deſcribe every ſenſation of a backſliding heart, and the many erring paths to which ſuch are expoſed, I ſhall, in this paper, draw the general outline of ſuch an unhappy caſe, and add my fervent prayer, that God may make it a mean to alarm the careleſs, humble the diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and reclaim the wanderer.</p>
               <p>True religion begins with Chriſt; he is our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, peace, hope, and everlaſting ſalvation. To
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:031228_0228_0FEB75F3E25857D8"/>
ſit under his ſhadow, and by faith experience the fruit of his paſſion, ſweet to our taſte, conſtitutes the ſublime happineſs of our ſouls: It is therefore evident, that the firſt ſtep to our departure from God, and our errors in life, begins at the croſs. John vi.68. The eye is allured from beholding the perſon of Jeſus and the heart partially ceaſes; to have ſenſible enjoyment of his grace and his love. Perhaps this obſervation may meet with conviction in the reader's breaſt;—the time is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered, that when impreſſed with guilt, and loaded with diſtreſs, he reſted at the croſs, beheld the bleeding Lamb, and felt peace and pleaſure with God. Then, how inceſſant was the panting of the heart <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> communion with the Saviour! the leaſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſoul, and made the eyes flow with tears. But now, though the name of Chriſt be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, it is not preciouſly enjoyed. The ſoul and Chriſt ſeldom meets in love, and feels the ſweets of pardon in his blood. A ſhyneſs has taken place, and the perfidious conduct of the Chriſtian deeply convinces his conſcience, and leaves him without excuſe. Perhaps the Saviour's charge may reach the reader's ears, and pierce his guilty breaſt:—"<hi>Know, therefore, and ſee, that it is an
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:031228_0229_0FEB75F56B515B00"/>
evil, and a bitter thing, that thou haſt forſaken the Lord thy God.</hi> Jer. ii.19.</p>
               <p>As by the croſs of Chriſt we are brought nigh to God, and enjoy the ſweets of fellowſhip with him as our Father; ſo, a neglect of the virtues of the croſs imperceptibly obſtructs us in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that high privilege. Our communion with God is carried on by faith, meditation, and prayer; the eſſence of which is, the ſecret motion of the ſoul in peace, adoration, hope, love, and joy; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing that ſolid ſatisfaction and ſublime pleaſure, which none but he that feels it knows. This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience conſtitutes our heaven upon earth. We thus walk with God, and never feel ourſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy but when interrupted in this holy path. Whatever affliction may attend us, it is in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God that our tears are wiped away, learn the deſign of every adverſe providence, and receive grace to help in time of need. Perhaps the reader may bring to recollection the time when he enjoyed this privilege with ſweet delight, drew near the Lord by prayer, could tell him all your grief, and receive the ſatisfaction which gave you bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to purſue the path of life with joy; but, you are conſcious it is not ſo now. You pray; but it is not in prayer: your meditations are attended with darkneſs; your faith is ſurrounded with ſuch amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:031228_0230_0FEB75F727968968"/>
unbelief, that often induces you to queſtion if ever you believed at all; and the motion of your heart to God is in great coldneſs and heavineſs. Thus, when you would do good, evil is ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with you; and a conſciouſneſs of guilt hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries you away from prayer, and increaſes the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of your ſoul from God. Standing thus as on the threſhold of the cloſet, you are ripe to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace any temptation which ſatan may propoſe. Thouſands of moſt excellent Chriſtians have mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this fatal ſpot, where apoſtacy more viſibly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan. If David could ſay, <hi>It is good for me to draw near to God,</hi> O how extremely bitter and dangerous the conſequence of living at a ſenſible diſtance from God! Chriſtian, where art thou? <hi>Take heed leſt there be in you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living God</hi>; for, be aſſured, <hi>the backſlider in heart ſhall be filled with his own ways.</hi> Prov. xiv.14. And, if you feel it not now, it will be more ſevere at a future period. You know not whither you may be led by ſin, therefore return unto the Lord, from whom you have deeply revolted.</p>
               <p>The loſs of ſenſible communion with God ſoon diſcovers itſelf in the diſpoſition of the mind, and in the actions of the life. The Word of the Lord was precious in thoſe days when the Chriſtian lived
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:031228_0231_0FEB75FA84B24540"/>
near to God: now it is read with indifference, without faith, without prayer, without a deſire to find Chriſt, and a determination to follow his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts or embrace his promiſes. In the diſcharge of domeſtic duties, the temper is altered; morning and evening prayer becomes formal; and the imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſervants and children are paſſed over with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reproof, becauſe the conſcience is an accuſer of its own ſin. Religious converſation, if held at all, is not upon the beauties of Chriſt, the riches of grace, or the experience of the heart; but, on ſpeculative points, the gifts of miniſters, the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate miſcarriages of others, or (what is pretty faſhionable among profeſſors of this day) the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline of religion, without producing one effort to revive it in themſelves or others. The Lord's day now comes rather of courſe, than from pleaſing anticipation. Public prayer is little enjoyed; and the preaching of the goſpel is not nouriſhing, for want of faith in him that hears it. Heb. iv.2.— Either the miniſter is charged with barrenneſs, or the hearer thinks himſelf ſufficiently wiſe without freſh inſtruction: nor is it uncommon to find ſuch a perſon going from one miniſter to another, in ſearch of <hi>ſomething new</hi>; yet nothing really ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the heart, becauſe, the man is diſſatisfied with himſelf, and at a diſtance from the Lord. This
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:031228_0232_0FEB75FDD34B7400"/>
ſpiritual decline of heart paves the way for a more general neglect of the means of grace—lives above them, and concludes, he is as well at home, or walking in the fields, as he would be at church. Thus, no wonder that the man who has loſt the comforts of grace in his ſoul ſhould miſimprove, or totally neglect the means of grace alſo.</p>
               <p>Lut us now take one ſtep farther with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volting Chriſtian, and mark the change which takes place in his conduct in the more buſy ſcenes of life. That ſweet reſtraint which a ſenſe of the love of God once created upon his ſoul, and directed his cautious ſteps in forming his connections, manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his trade, and anſwering his obligations, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually wears away, and his heart takes a more ſpeedy flight after all which the world calls good and great. He may now paſs for a <hi>polite Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>; having the name, but deſtitute of the ſpirit of a lively believer, and of courſe tries pretty hard to make his profeſſion and his worldly purſuits com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port with each other. The men of buſineſs can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, however, but perceive that this man has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably loſt the fine bloom of his religious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and triumphantly exclaim—<hi>See, the man hath become like one of us!</hi> It is now that he ſtands in the way of indulging thoſe maxims, and committing thoſe evils which before his ſoul abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:031228_0233_0FEB75FF60417240"/>
and which he ſeverely reproved in others. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan meets him upon his own ground, ſuits his bates to the frame of his heart, and, by every method in his infernal power, blinds his mind, hardens his heart, and pollutes his paſſions. Here, at leaſt, let us ſtop—No man's pea, or tongue, can aſcertain how far, and to what wretched lengths a man in ſuch a ſtate may go;—rather than attempt ſuch a purſuit, it is the wiſh of the writer of this paper to aſk the reader, <hi>Is this caſe your own?</hi> Happy for you, if it is not. Teſtify your gratitude to God; live upon Chriſt; plead his Spirit; keep his ſtatutes; watch the motion of your heart, and you are happy indeed! But, if this deſcription of a back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlider, in either, or in all its ſtages, ſhews your own likeneſs, and your conſcience ſays, <hi>Thou art the man,</hi> let me ſolemnly intreat you to reflect upon your caſe. Each ſtage has an eaſy tranſitition to another; he that is not watchful of the firſt, will ſoon find himſelf in the next, and, like a rolling ſtone, will find the way to the botton.</p>
               <p>Remember, the ſin of your departure from God has been committed with your eyes open. What ingratitude is this to God for his love—to Chriſt for his ſalvation—and to the Bleſſed Spirit for his inſtruction and conſolation!—Did you not ſolemnly devote yourſelf to be the Lord's at your conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:031228_0234_0FEB7605DC5192A0"/>
and have you not frequently renewed this ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render in private, at your baptiſm, and at the Lord's Supper?—What evil has the Lord done unto you? and wherein has he wearied you? Were not his paths pleaſant, his promiſes ſweet, and his ſmiles charming? In how many ſcenes of diſtreſs has he delivered you? And in the bounty of his providence, and the riches of his grace, how often has he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded your higheſt expectations? What griefs does your preſent coldneſs of heart and diſobedience of life create in the breaſt of thoſe who are the friends of Chriſt, and who knew you when a hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, lively, happy chriſtian?—Neither forget the diſcouragements which you give to the lambs of the flock who are ſeeking the paths of the Lord; and the advantage you offer the enemies of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to impeach its virtues.—Surely you cannot be inſenſible what injury you do your own ſouls. Are you as happy now as when you delighted beneath the Shepherd's care, and fed in the rich paſture of his grace? O! no. Think, for a moment, were temptations now to aſſail you, how awfully you might fall, and ſink deeper into ſin and miſery?— If death was now to advance, where is your certain hope of future bliſs? Can you ſhut your eyes, harden your heart, purſue in ſin, and abandon the Lord of life? God forbid! There is a certain

                  <p>Young perſons are apt to trifle with the thoughts of death, and imagine an horrid gloom to attend the practice of piety; and that it neceſſarily excludes the chriſtian from ſocial pleaſures; but ſuch concluſions are made by thoſe only who love to gratify thoſe depraved paſſions which the law of God condemns, and who never yet taſted happineſs in God. Theſe, my daughter, you muſt pronounce improper judges in the caſe. Perſons of true piety know that religion refines the groſſer paſſions, creates a better reliſh for ſocial pleaſures, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of introducing them to gloomy ſhades, it is the only path by which they can eſcape that dreadful darkneſs which reſted upon the mind of your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted friend.</p>

                  <speaker>Daughter.</speaker>
                  <p>I know, madam, we are too apt to be miſled, and to ſuppreſs thoughts of mortality; but I hope, from Charlotte's death, to be more ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous for my future life.</p>

                  <speaker>Mother.</speaker>
                  <p>In this your own happineſs and the comfort of your parents very much depend. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you quit my chamber, let me urge you to the duties of <hi>prayer,</hi> and reading the ſcriptures. Prayer is the opening of the heart to God—confeſſing our guilt, and imploring his mercy. This is the great
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:031228_0239_0FEB7614B4656FD8"/>
duty which enlivens every other, and fills the ſoul with the higheſt ſatisfaction; but it is a duty to which, by ſin, we are naturally averſe. Beg the Lord to give you an heart to pray. Never ſuffer yourſelf to be aſhamed of this duty, however others may deſpiſe it. If it be an honour to converſe with a king upon his throne, it is infinitely greater to have audience with the LORD OF GLORY, and delight beneath his heavenly ſmiles!</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Daughter.</speaker>
                  <p>I know this is a very great duty, nor do I wholly neglect it; but I have ſo many unruly thoughts, and I know ſo little of God, that it ſeems almoſt uſeleſs for me to attempt to pray.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mother.</speaker>
                  <p>This then, my child, will convince you of the importance of the other duty I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended you,—the reading of the Scriptures. This gives us juſt thoughts of the moral attributes of God,—ſhews us how, in Chriſt, ſinners are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and can have fellowſhip with God, by the aid of his Holy Spirit. The mind being eſtabliſhed in this, ten thouſand other precious ſubjects will unfold to your view, and give you the higheſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction poſſible. In the language of an excellent writer I may tell you, GO, READ THE BIBLE TO BE GAY. No pleaſures are ſo refined as thoſe which flow from the love of God upon the heart; no ſupports are equal to thoſe which the promiſes
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:031228_0240_0FEB76164A427ED0"/>
inſpire;—no proſpects of futurity are ſo rational and divine, as revelation opens to the believing mind. Although this duty might be performed at any time, yet I recommend you to attend to it in the morning, when the heart is free for contemplation. Begin with the Pſalms and the Evangeliſts, and read a chapter in each; and after you have done, fail not to propoſe ſuch queſtions as theſe—What do I in theſe chapters learn of God?—Which verſe leads me to diſcover the beauties of a Saviour, and convinces me of my need of Him? Which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is moſt ſuited to encourage my mind, and which Precept appears neceſſary for me to obey? Perſons in general read a chapter, cloſe the book, and it is over;—but if ſuch interrogations as I have propoſed be made, they will never fail to impreſs the Scriptures more forcibly on your mind, inlarge your views of God and his grace, and conſequently give you the higheſt encouragement to perform the duty of prayer.</p>

Mark xvi.16. In this ſtate mankind would have lived and died; and, in a future ſtate of exiſtence, been compelled to <hi>believe</hi> the juſtice of God, and the evil of ſin, in their own puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, had not God, in the glory of his grace, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided a way by which guilty men ſhould be brought back again to him—a new principle of faith creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their unbelieving ſoul, and thus their moral and eternal happineſs ſecured.</p>
               <p>The goſpel informs us, that <hi>faith is the gift of God</hi>; Eph. ii.8. that it is obtained through the righteouſneſs of God and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, 2 Pet. i.1. and produced in the heart by the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Holy Spirit. Gal. v.22. Col. ii.12. It is a conſtituent part of that new life which Chriſt
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:031228_0248_0FEB763146FE5C08"/>
communicates to all his people, diſtinguiſhing them in their ſtate, ſenſibility, obedience, pleaſures, and proſpects, from other men; and thoſe who have it are daily taught practically to believe that the growth, ſtrength, comfort, and lively exertion of their faith, wholly depend upon Jeſus, who is <hi>the author and finiſher of our faith.</hi> Heb. xii.2. As faith is of ſuch infinite conſequence to our preſent peace and future happineſs, I ſhall, in this eſſay, form a ſhort collection of its virtues, and wiſh that they may be more highly experienced in every rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's breaſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It ſcatters the clouds of <hi>ſelf-deſception,</hi> which naturally cover the depraved heart of man; ſhews his true character as a ſinner, and reveals his ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Chriſt for eternity. Thus, he that believeth hath the witneſs in himſelf. 1 John v.10. God's word is the ground of faith: in this, as in a pure mirror, the enlightened ſinner ſees his own likeneſs, and is filled with ſelf-abaſement. His heart gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally opens; its treachery, power, and vileneſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him, were it poſſible, to fly from himſelf. The immortality of the ſoul, the conſequence of tranſgreſſion, his obligation to the <hi>law,</hi> the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of death, the ſolemnity of judgment, and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of forgiveneſs; theſe, and many other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant truths which before he either denied or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:031228_0249_0FEB763475302E30"/>
are now conveyed to his conſcience, with the fulleſt demonſtration from the Almighty. He had often heard his character deſcribed by others; he had frequently felt the convictions of his own conſcience; he knew his heart was not altogether right with God; but now, by <hi>faith</hi> of the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, he knows his caſe to be deſperate, and to live and die in ſuch a ſtate fills him with grief. All things within him, and around him, wear their true colours, and impreſs his ſoul with that ſolemn weight he never felt before. Proud nature, aided by ſatan, may deviſe ten thouſand ways to recover itſelf; but ſuch is the virtue of that <hi>faith</hi> by which the work was begun, that the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner finds a perfect inability to amend his conſcience and obtain peace with God, and firmly <hi>believes,</hi> if ever he is ſaved, it muſt be by grace alone. The ear which once turned from the charming voice of the goſpel, now liſtens with attention. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the God-man Chriſt Jeſus, the perfection of his righteouſneſs, the fulneſs of his atonement, the riches of his grace, the freeneſs of his love to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, the chief of ſinners, his moſt inveterate ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, engage the awakened mind, and create a longing for a ſhare in ſo great a ſalvation. The word preached profits, being mixed with faith in him that hears it. He begins to underſtand the
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:031228_0250_0FEB76393864D420"/>
truth, which before he deſpiſed, that, <hi>by the deeds of the law there ſhall no fleſh be juſtified in the ſight of God,</hi> becauſe they are imperfect and vile, which the law condemns and not accepts;—<hi>but now the righteouſneſs of God, without the law, is manifeſted, being witneſſed by the law and the prophets: even the righteouſneſs of God by faith of Jeſus Chriſt unto all, and upon all them that believe; for there is no difference.</hi> Rom. iii.21—23. This diſcovers the goſpel to be worthy of its AUTHOR, and to contain a ſuitable ſalvation for the ſinner. There can be no greater ground for faith in Chriſt than that the GOD againſt whom we have ſinned, hath ſet HIM forth in the goſpel, a <hi>propitiation through faith in his blood, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his righteouſneſs in the remiſſion of ſins that are paſt, that he might be juſt, and the juſtifier of him which believeth in Jeſus.</hi> Rom. iii.25, 26. Here reſts our faith: cut off from this we periſh. The belief of it engages the heart and ſoul moſt earneſtly to pray for it. The ſame bleſſed Saviour who ſaid, <hi>All things whatever ye ſhall aſk in prayer, believing, ye ſhall receive,</hi> Matt. xxi.22. in due time returns a gracious anſwer, by manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf to the trembling heart, ſaying, <hi>Fear not, I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name, thou art mine.</hi> Iſa. xliii.1. This is
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:031228_0251_0FEB763B12882400"/>
enough; faith credits the report, and brings the comfort of the promiſe. Chriſt dwells in the heart by faith. Eph. iii.12. My beloved is mine, and I am his. Sol. Song ii.16. The conſcience feels peace with God, being ſatisfied with, and reconcil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the blood of Chriſt. What joy and peace in believing! The ſoul caſts itſelf into the bleeding boſom of the Saviour, and finds reſt, pardon, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, hope and happineſs indiſcribable. From what Chriſt is in himſelf, what he hath done for ſinners, what he hath done for me, and my entering into the love of his heart, by faith; theſe are evidences to me of my intereſt in him, and I reſt aſſured he will love me to the end. This experience of the heart is called <hi>the work of faith,</hi> 2 Theſſ. i.11. becauſe ſuch are its ſoul reclaiming, ſaving virtues, which never could have been produced by nature, the powers of reaſon, the circle of the arts, nor all the objects of ſenſe; and brings the higheſt honour to Jehovah.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As the croſs of Chriſt leads to communion with the Father, we will now examine the virtues of <hi>faith,</hi> in enabling us to walk humbly and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily with him. This is the ſubſtance of religion. <hi>We walk by faith, not by ſight.</hi> 2 Cor. v.7. By faith we ſee him who is inviſible to the eye of ſenſe; enjoy the comforts of a covenant relation in God
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:031228_0252_0FEB763E38155490"/>
as our Father; exult in the glories of his attributes in our redemption, and walk in the light of his countenance. We know nothing of ſuch a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of grace but as it is revealed in the Bible; and it is the virtue of faith to receive the truth as it is in Chriſt, and enjoy the comfort of it. It is the object of unbelief to raiſe a cloud between the chriſtian and his God, to interrupt the pleaſures of communion; but faith, nouriſhed by the Spirit of Chriſt, is ſtronger than unbelief fed by ſatan, and therefore the darkneſs ſoon vaniſhes, and the light of faith cheers the heart.—All our communion with God is maintained by faith in the blood of Chriſt. <hi>Having therefore, brethren, boldneſs to enter into the holieſt by the blood of Jeſus, by a new and living way which he hath conſecrated for us—let us draw near with a true heart, in full aſſurance of faith.</hi> Heb. x.19—22. It is the perſon and blood of Jeſus, the great High Prieſt, that render our perſons, prayers, and praiſes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God; and this is the way alone in which God will meet and commune with us; nor can we enjoy any ſenſible, lively communion with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, unleſs by faith we reſt upon the precious blood of the Lamb; guilt will ſtop our mouth, fears will ariſe in our breaſt, and our ſpirits will ſtand at a ſorrowful diſtance from God.—As God hath given
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:031228_0253_0FEB76448C49FB18"/>
us exceeding great and precious promiſes, on which we may reſt our prayer, enjoy communion with him, and wait for the good things promiſed; ſo it is by <hi>faith</hi> that we embrace the promiſes, view them in Chriſt, who poſſeſſes the grace and glory promiſed, and who is engaged to make them good to all that believe. 2 Cor. i.20. It is not poſſible for us to enjoy communion with the Father, ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from the Redeemer. <hi>Truly, our fellowſhip is with the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> To them that believe, Jeſus is increaſingly precious in all the ſacred relations and offices he ſuſtains; and it is the virtue of faith to lead the chriſtian, under all his neceſſities, to <hi>employ</hi> Chriſt as his Prieſt, Prophet, King, and Shepherd; and thus, as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, ſo he walks <hi>in</hi> him, and has the moſt ſolid peace of conſcience, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of ſoul in walking <hi>with</hi> the Father—Nor is it poſſible that <hi>faith</hi> ſhould be unconcerned about the influence of the Spirit of God, who implanted it in the heart. As by believing we know we have nothing, nor can we do any thing to raiſe our hearts to communion with God; ſo the be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="249" facs="unknown:031228_0254_0FEB764616247CD0"/>3. Proceed to enquire into the virtues of <hi>faith,</hi> in producing obedience. The ſcripture ſpeaks of faith that purifieth the heart, and worketh by love, Acts xv.9. Gal. v.6. and that the goſpel was preached among all nations for the <hi>obedience of faith.</hi> Rom. xvi.26. Faith creates new princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, affords the ſublimeſt motives, and propoſes the moſt glorious ends, on which an immortal ſoul can act before God and man. God is our moſt gracious, everlaſting Father, and we obey his will, not as ſlaves, but as his adopted children. Chriſt hath bought us with his precious blood, and we yield ourſelves to him as our Sovereign, Lord, and King. Introduced by grace into his ſpiritual king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, we receive from his hand THE LAW OF FAITH, Rom. iii.27. the <hi>goſpel,</hi> ſanctioned by his divine authority, and inforced by his redeeming love. In this law is contained every precept eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to our walk with God, the worſhip due to his name, the government of ourſelves, our conduct in the world, our conflict with our enemies, and our fellowſhip with the ſaints. So far from the poſſeſſion of faith leading men into neglect and licentiouſneſs, it is the ſpring to every good word and work; for, as it hath been often ſaid, "He that hath St. Paul's <hi>faith</hi> will never fail to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe St. James's <hi>works.</hi>" The chriſtian firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:031228_0255_0FEB7647AF7FC658"/>
that there can be no precept which the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of his Saviour enjoins in the law of faith, that can be trivial and unneceſſary; therefore his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is univerſal, and, with David, <hi>he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect unto all God's teſtimonies.</hi> The virtues of faith produce the higheſt pleaſures and cheerfulneſs in obedience—It is my Father's command—my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's love conſtrains—it is connected with my character—it may promote the happineſs of another, and diſplay the honour of my Lord; therefore, with an enlarged heart I will run the way of his commands, and think myſelf happy to obey. <hi>Let us then hold faſt the profeſſion of our faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wavering, for he is faithful that promiſed: and let us conſider one another unto love and good works; for herein is our Father glorified, that we bear much fruit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. As the Lord's are a poor and an afflicted people, they need a <hi>Faith,</hi> whoſe virtues ſhall bear them above their deepeſt ſorrows. The believer has trials in common with other men; and he has afflictions peculiar to himſelf, the chief of which are found within his own breaſt. As a diſciple of Chriſt, he believes his Lord and Maſter has wiſely allotted a <hi>croſs,</hi> for the exerciſe of his faith, the trial of his patience, and the proof of his ſincerity, and therefore it is with cheerfulneſs he takes it up.
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:031228_0256_0FEB76498CE83300"/>
The word of God contains many ſalutary cordials for ſuffering chriſtians, and ſhews them, that, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſevere, they ſpring from a Father's love, and are deſigned to promote their real intereſt. <hi>Belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, think it not ſtrange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though ſome ſtrange thing had happened unto you; but rejoice, in as much as ye are partakers of Chriſt's ſufferings; that, when his glory ſhall be revealed, ye may be glad alſo with exceeding joy.</hi> 1 Pet. iv.12.13. <hi>We know that all things work together for good to them that love God.</hi> Rom. viii.28. Afflictions brighten, manifeſt, and improve the virtues of faith; and faith makes afflictions fruitful of real good, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to the ſoul, and frequently to the body. It is as an anchor to the ſoul, keeping it quiet in the boſom of the Father's love, that, however long and ſevere, the ſtorm ſhall produce a brighter ſky, and make him more humble, patient, watchful, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and happy. He believes there is no rod held in his Father's hand without honey at the end—no croſs without a crown—nor crown without a croſs. The darker the providence, the more intricate the path; and the more violent the oppoſition, the greater is the opportunity for faith to diſcover its intrinſic virtue. It will hang upon Chriſt in the midſt of a wreck—it will truſt him when he ſeems to have
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:031228_0257_0FEB7651CC92DB58"/>
forſaken—it will always ſhine the brighteſt when there is the leaſt objects of ſenſe to ſurround it— it will draw conſolation from the ancient tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God in eternity, and look forward with tranſport to futurity. It is impoſſible to enumerate or to eſtimate the virtues of faith! It however ſhines brighteſt in the furnace: there can be no ſight ſo honourable to God, ſo gratifying to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder, and ſo convicting to the eye of infidelity, as to ſee a chriſtian ſtripped of the creature, yet full of love to the Creator; ſurrounded with thick darkneſs, yet light in the Lord; walking on the borders of deſpair, yet believing in hope againſt hope, that every event ſhall terminate to the honour of God and the real happineſs of himſelf!</p>
               <p n="5">5. If ſuch are the virtues of <hi>faith</hi> to a chriſtian in life, they muſt be ſuperior in the article of death. Of the long liſt of ancient worthies contained in the 11th of Hebrews, it is ſaid, <hi>theſe all died in faith!</hi> To profeſs faith is eaſy; to poſſeſs faith is a bleſſing which none but God can give; to die in faith, is to enjoy more peace, and more happineſs than ten thouſand worlds can beſtow; and which can only be exceeded by the full poſſeſſion of the glories of immortality! If by faith all things were diſcovered in their true colours, and felt in their due weight of influence upon the mind in life, much
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:031228_0258_0FEB765395357568"/>
more ſo the nature, appendages, and end of death become viſible, and all things around now become truly ſolemn! By faith the dying chriſtian takes a view of Death, clad in all his native horrors, lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mankind to an awful ſtate of puniſhment due to their tranſgreſſions; feels the ſentence within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and drops the ſilent tear—Then looks on Chriſt, who has conquered Death, and perfumed the grave with his own bleſſed body, and from a lively faith of intereſt in him cries, "This God is my God, and he ſhall be my guide even through death!—Though fleſh and heart fail, the Lord ſhall be the ſtrength of my life and my portion forever! —I am perſuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, ſhall be able to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate me from the love of God, which is in Chriſt Jeſus my Lord!" Nor does faith yield its virtues only in the immediate article of dying: No—

                  <p>Yes, my child, you may think ſo, and I am happy you have ſuch thoughts; but, myſelf and others, who have got mid-way the ocean of life, have found the advantage of a guide for our youth, and a ſtaff for our years. So extremely ſhort are many of the viciſſitudes of life, one needs ſomething more than mortal to prepare us for them, and preſerve us in a virtuous path. How often does the mariner ſit with eaſe at his helm, the gentle gale fills the ſheets, and his cheerful heart hails his port in view!—but, the wind ſhifts, the tide turns, the clouds lower, and, in a little while, his bark is daſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſtorm, and nought but death appears! Such, ſuch are the changes of our lives, from health to ſickneſs, pleaſure to pain—proſperity to adverſity;
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:031228_0263_0FEB7662495A4598"/>
theſe frequently alternate, till, at laſt, arrives the great change from life to death! O happy thoſe who have ſtood the ſtorm and tempeſt, at laſt, by faith in Chriſt, arrive at the port of everlaſting bliſs! But theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections have ſomewhat diverted one from a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular piece of inſtruction, neceſſary to your preſent ſtage of life.</p>

Entering into ſuch a relation, either hazards, or promotes our happineſs in paſſing over the ocean of time, and generally has a very conſiderable influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon our morals. To marry only for beauty, is to purchaſe a houſe for the noſe-gay in its win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, which muſt ſoon fade, and probably prove ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to its poſſeſſor. To marry only for riches, is to deceive our own paſſions, and eventually makes us poor indeed. Our own affections too often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us in common things; and therefore, in ſuch an important connection as this, the utmoſt delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and care are abſolutely neceſſary, infinitely more ſo than that yonder mariner, who ploughs the ocean, ſhould firſt have aſcertained the ſtability of his veſſel, before he put to ſea. The ſafeſt way is to ſeek direction from that adored Saviour, who vouchſafed his preſence at a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and we may be certain, that marriage
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:031228_0264_0FEB76656DAE36C0"/>
promiſes little moral felicity, where Jeſus is not invited as a gueſt; as pious biſhop Hall ſays, "Thoſe that marry IN Chriſt, cannot marry WITHOUT him." This was the baſis on which my connection was formed with your honoured father, and has often been to me a ſource of pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reflection;—it has ſupported us both under ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſevere domeſtic trials, and ſtill affords us the higheſt gratification.

The <hi>ſpecies</hi> are, 1. Aris, or ram and ewe; the horns of which are ſhaped like a half-moon, and compreſſed. 2. The Guineenſis, or Guinea ſheep, has pendulous ears, large hairy dew lips, and a prominence on the hind part of the head. The wool is ſhort, like that of the goat. 3. The Strep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiceros, or Creton ſheep, has ſtrait carinated horns, twiſted in a ſpiral manner. It is a native of Mount Iola. The ſheep is the moſt harmleſs, and yet moſt expoſed to danger of all other animals.

He was <hi>the Lamb ſlain from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world</hi>; decreed ſo to be, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually exhibited as ſuch through ſucceſſive pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods, until he ſhed his blood for men. Rev. xiii.8. This, probably, therefore, was the creature ſlain, the ſkin of which <hi>the Lord God made coats and clothed</hi> our firſt diſobedient parents, to teach them the neceſſity of a ſacrifice; and, that righteouſneſs, procured by HIM, who was <hi>to bruiſe the ſerpent's head,</hi> that they might be juſtified with God.</p>
               <p>It is certain, that the <hi>Lamb,</hi> ſelected by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs command of the Almighty, to be the victim ſacrificed, to ſecure the Hebrews when the deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing angel was commiſſioned to ſmite the firſt born of Egypt, and to form the ſupper for thoſe who

were to paſs over the Red Sea, did, in a very cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantial manner, typify the bleſſed Jeſus, and the rich benefits of his grace. An expoſitor, who cannot be miſtaken, has given us this interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that remarkable ceremony: <hi>Chriſt, our Paſſover, is ſacrificed for us.</hi> 1 Cor. v.7. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring, hereby, that Chriſt is a <hi>real</hi> ſacrifice; that he was <hi>prefigured</hi> in this capacity, by the Paſchal Lamb; that the circumſtances which diſtinguiſhed it met in him; and the <hi>advantages</hi> which reſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from it flowed through him.</p>
               <p>The name of this celebrated feaſt <hi>Paſcha,</hi> Paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, becauſe the angel of the Lord <hi>paſſed over</hi> the doors of the Iſraelites, on ſeeing the poſts thereof ſprinkled with the blood of the Lamb; evangelically it points to the great feaſt of the goſpel. God, paſſing over the offences of his people, through the complete ſatisfaction by the blood of Jeſus Chirſt.—The Lamb was <hi>to be taken from the ſheep, or from the goats</hi>; Jeſus <hi>was made a partaker of fleſh and blood,</hi> and, <hi>in all things like unto his brethren</hi>; yet, <hi>ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated</hi> from them in his deſignation to the office of a Mediator, in the miraculouſneſs of his Incarnation, and in his performing the great work of redemption alone.—The Paſchal Lamb was <hi>without blemiſh:</hi> ſuch was the Lamb of God, free from all taint of original ſin, and from every ſpot of actual tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:031228_0270_0FEB767A6C8FDA28"/>
he was <hi>holy, harmleſs, undefiled</hi>; and, <hi>through the eternal Spirit, he offered himſelf without ſpot to God.—A Lamb of the firſt year,</hi> in all the ſprightlineſs and beauty of youth; Chriſt alſo laid down his life, not when worn out with age, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitated with ſickneſs, but in the very prime of his days, amidſt all the bloom of health, and all the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of manhood, that this tender, precious Lamb may prove the ſweeteſt food for the believing ſoul; and to teſtify that his ſacrifice is of perpetual effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy.—Nor is it without meaning that the Lamb was, for the ſpace of <hi>four days,</hi> ſeparated from the fold; for thus alſo it was with Chriſt, if we reckon prophetic days for years. Ezek. iv.6. At his <hi>thirti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> year he left his mother's houſe, as a fold, where he was born and brought up, and was crucified the <hi>fourth</hi> after. But it likewiſe deſerves obſervation, that Chriſt came to Jeruſalem to the feaſt, and to his laſt paſſover, on that very day on which God had commanded the Lamb to be kept up in Egypt, the tenth of the month Niſan. For ſix days before the paſſover, he came to Bethany, John xii.1. that is, on the ninth of the month Niſan: the day after he went to Jeruſalem, ver. 11. to preſent himſelf to be offered to God.— The Lamb was to be ſlain in ſuch a manner as might occaſion the moſt copious effuſion of blood;
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:031228_0271_0FEB767BF76B58F0"/>
and was not this very exactly fulfilled in our ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Saviour? On ſight of that CUP of indignation he came to drink, blood iſſued from every vein, and fell in vaſt drops upon <hi>Gathſamane's</hi> ground! the rending laſhes of the <hi>ſcourge</hi>; the lacerating points of <hi>thorns</hi>; the rugged <hi>nails</hi> which pierced his hands and his feet; the deadly <hi>ſpear</hi> which ripped his ſide, and made way to his heart; theſe, theſe were the ways through which his moſt precious blood flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to waſh away our ſtains.—Though the blood was to be ſo copiouſly ſhed, <hi>a bone</hi> of the Lamb <hi>was not to be broken</hi>; a circumſtance this which a wonderful, interpoſing Providence directed. The ſoldiers had received their commiſſion to <hi>break the legs</hi> of the three crucified perſons. When they had actually broken the legs of each malefactor which hung on the right ſide of our Lord and on his left, their minds were over-ruled to ſpare the bleſſed Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and to leave his bones untouched.—The Lamb was to be killed <hi>before the whole aſſembly</hi>; and did not the whole multitude of the Jews conſpire againſt our Redeemer to put him to death? Did they not all, with one voice, cry, <hi>Crucify him, crucify him?</hi> Was he not put to death at one of their grand feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, and in the ſight of the whole aſſembled nation? The <hi>blood</hi> was not to be poured heedleſſly upon the ground, but received carefully into a baſon,
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:031228_0272_0FEB767D8DA79EE8"/>
and <hi>ſprinkled</hi> with the utmoſt punctuality <hi>upon the door poſts.</hi> In like manner the blood of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Lamb was to be realized in heaven, and to be received by an humble faith, and applied to our conſciences.—The ſprinkling of the blood of that Lamb ſecured every Iſraelite from the deſtroying angel's ſword; and the blood of Jeſus Chriſt <hi>cleanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from all ſin,</hi> and ſaves us from the pains of eternal death.—The Lamb was to be <hi>roaſted with fire,</hi> and the ſoul of Chriſt ſuffered the fire of divine anger againſt ſin; ſo that, according to David, <hi>his heart was like wax, melted in the midſt of his bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els!</hi>—As the blood of the Paſchal Lamb was the peace and preſervation of the Hebrews, ſo they were to <hi>eat the whole fleſh, and</hi> none <hi>of it was to remain until the morning:</hi> thus the Lord Chriſt hath not only made peace by the blood of his croſs, but hath given <hi>his fleſh for the life of the world; his fleſh is meat indeed</hi>—more nouriſhing to our ſouls than the delicious fleſh of the tender lamb is to our bodies; and, <hi>whoſoever eateth thereof hath everlaſting life.</hi> Not a part only, but the whole of this precious Lamb of God is embraced by faith: his perſon, obedience, life, death, grace, and offices, form the delightful food of his ranſomed people, ſo that, emphatically, he is ſaid to be <hi>all, and in all.</hi> It muſt not be forgotten, that thoſe who celebrated
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:031228_0273_0FEB76858ADE70B0"/>
the Paſchal Supper, eat the Lamb with <hi>unleaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed bread, and with bitter herbs; their loins were girt, their feet ſhod, their ſtaff in their hands, and to eat in haſte</hi>; equally thoſe who, by faith, feed upon Chriſt, the ſlaughtered Lamb, <hi>keep the feaſt with the unleavened bread of ſincerity and truth</hi>; the bitter herbs of affliction are of real ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to enliven and preſerve the appetite of their ſoul, that they may feed more deliciouſly upon the Saviour; <hi>for, if we ſuffer with him, we ſhall alſo reign with him</hi>; their <hi>loins are girt about with truth</hi>; their <hi>feet ſhod with the preparation of the goſpel of peace</hi>; the ſtaff of divine <hi>Promiſe</hi> is held in the hand of <hi>Faith</hi>; and in their general deportment they teſtify that <hi>here they have no abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing city, but ſeek one to come.</hi> The whole of this very remarkable inſtitution was from the Lord, without the ſolicitation, or the merit of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew captives, to produce their temporal deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; infinitely more ſo the gift of Chriſt, the Lamb of God, was the ſole fruit of the Father's unmerited, everlaſting love; to procure our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from ſin, the power of ſatan, the ſting of death, the curſe of the law, to bring us the enjoyment of God in time, and to lead us over the red ſea of death to the manſions of glory in eternity.</p>

which the prophet Iſaiah had of Meſſiah, the Lamb of God, who was to <hi>bear the ſin of many. He was oppreſſed and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the ſlaughter, and as a ſheep before her ſhearers is dumb. ſo he openeth not his mouth.</hi> liii.7.

Had the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet lived in Jeruſalem at the very period Jeſus was betrayed, by a perfidious diſciple, for <hi>thirty pieces of ſilver,</hi> and taken to the bar of Pilate; had he ſtood by in the priſon while the Saviour ſubmitted to be <hi>ſcourged and ſpit upon</hi>; had he actually crowded among the murdering Jews, and followed in the mouring train to <hi>Calvary,</hi> he could not in colours more ſtrongly have marked the ſolemn ſcene, nor deſcribed the patience, humility, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the bleſſed Jeſus under his crucifiers. But if innocence mark this diſtinguiſhed Lamb, why theſe extreme ſufferings? Let the evangelic prophet himſelf reply. <hi>The Lord hath lain upon him the iniquity of us all, and he bears the ſin of many; thou ſhalt make his ſoul an offering for ſin; therefore, it pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him, and to put him to grief. He was wounded for our tranſgreſſions; he was bruiſed for our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities: the chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him, and with his ſtripes we are healed.</hi> PHI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIP,

a preacher of the goſpel, well underſtood this prophecy; therefore, when the Eunuch aſked him, <hi>Of whom ſpeak the prophet this?</hi> of <hi>himſelf, or of ſome other man?</hi> Philip began at the ſame ſcripture, and preached <hi>unto him Jeſus,</hi> with the moſt pleaſurable ſucceſs. Acts viii. JOHN, too, when he ſaw Jeſus, equally underſtood whom he was, when he exhorted his two companions to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Lamb of God!</hi> John i.29. All that was deſigned by the Paſchal Lamb, and the bleeding lambs uſed in the daily ſacrifice;—all that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets propheſied of Meſſiah, centre in this lamb, emphatically called the LAMB OF GOD;—of his own nature, of his own providing, of his own ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing, and of his own accepting! O for the light of faith, to behold this adored Lamb in all the excellence of his nature, and to enjoy him in all the virtues of his ſacrifice!

               <p>If the contemplation of the Lamb at the <hi>ſlaughter</hi> creates ſuch ſolemn ſenſations; let us, by aid of the ſcriptures, behold him glorified upon his throne.

               <p>HAVING attempted, in No. V. page 222, to deſcribe the ſeveral ſtages of a revolting chriſtian, and the aggravations of his conduct; agreeably to my promiſe I ſhall, in this paper, enumerate ſome of thoſe means by which the GOOD SHEPHERD reſtores his wandering ſheep, and the ſenſibility which ſuch experience on their return.</p>
               <p>It is an unſpeakable mercy to us, that God hath ſaid, <hi>I will ſet mine eyes upon them for good;— I will build them, and not pull them down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up. And I will give them an heart to know me, that I am the Lord; and they ſhall be my people, and I will
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:031228_0279_0FEB7696394358F8"/>
be their God; for they ſhall return unto me with their whole heart.</hi> Jer. xxiv.6, 7. Thoſe eyes pervade our path, and penetrate the inmoſt receſſes of our hearts; not to purſue us with deſerved judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but to overcome us with his unbounded mercy! That adored Saviour who hath purchaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his people with his moſt precious blood, <hi>deviſeth means that his baniſhed people be not expelled from him.</hi> 2 Sam. xiv.14. Theſe means are wiſely adapted to the end, and never fail to bring the wanderer home with tears.</p>
               <p>The miniſters of the goſpel are commanded to go, and proclaim theſe words—<hi>Return, thou back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding Iſrael, ſaith the Lord; and I will not cauſe mine anger to fall upon you, for I am mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, ſaith the Lord; and I will not keep anger for ever. Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou haſt tranſgreſſed againſt the Lord thy God, and have not obeyed my voice, ſaith the Lord. Turn, O backſliding children, ſaith the Lord, for I am married unto you.</hi> Jer. iii.12, 13, 14. The ſoul of diſobedient David was brought to a ſenſibility of its ſhameful guilt, and awful departure from the Lord, by a meſſage ſent by Nathan the prophet—<hi>Thou art the man.</hi> 2 Sam. xii.7. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are faithfully to declare unto revolting pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, that <hi>their own wickedneſs ſhall correct
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:031228_0280_0FEB769B021F0F70"/>
them, and their own backſlidings ſhall reprove them</hi>;—that ſuch ſhould deeply <hi>know, and ſee, that it is an evil thing, and a bitter, that they have forſaken the Lord their God, and that his fear is not in them, ſaith the Lord God of Hoſts.</hi> Jer. ii.19. By ſo doing God often conveys an arrow of conviction to the heart, opens its guilt, produces repentance, and reſtores the backſlider to the ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enjoyment of his ſmiles.</p>
               <p>Affliction is another mean by which the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer is frequently reſtored. <hi>If his children for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake my law, and walk not in my judgment; if they break my ſtatutes, and keep not my command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, then will I viſit their tranſgreſſions with the rod, and their iniquities with ſtripes. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, my loving kindneſs will I not utterly take from him, nor ſuffer my faithfulneſs to fail.</hi> Pſa. lxxxix.3. God hath many rods; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be held in a Father's hands, and honey be at the end of every twig, yet they are calculated to make the diſobedient feel. According to the complexion of the mind, the wanderings of the heart, and the errors of the life, will be the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of the chaſtiſement; <hi>the fruit of all is to take away ſin.</hi> Iſa. xxvii.9. God's dealing with Iſrael, recorded in the ſecond and thirteenth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Hoſea, ſhould be ſolemn warnings to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volting
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:031228_0281_0FEB769C8ADD6328"/>
chriſtian. Although in the midſt of proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, and reclining upon the lap of eaſe, God can, by a variety of providences, and by unexpected means, <hi>hedge up your way with thorns,</hi> and <hi>make a wall,</hi> that you ſhould not <hi>find your path. God's furnace is in Zion, and his fire in Jeruſalem.</hi> Iſa. xxxi.9. purpoſely to try and refine his own people from their droſs. Remember, it is not any <hi>fire,</hi> any <hi>furnace,</hi> nor any <hi>affliction,</hi> that will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the purpoſe of reclaiming a backſlider; but it is God's fire, which he kindles in faithfulneſs, love, and mercy; and which will, ſooner or later, humble the proud heart, and bring the tranſgreſſor to the Lord. Afflictions in themſelves do but irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, harden, and produce rebellion; but God's chaſtiſement ſhall heal as well as wound; for, ſaith the Lord concerning the revolting chriſtian, <hi>I have ſeen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him alſo, and reſtore comforts unto him, and to his mourners.</hi> Iſa. lviii.18. For this very purpoſe Chriſt <hi>ſits as a refiner and purifier of ſilver; and he ſhall purify the ſons of Levi, and purge them as gold and ſilver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteouſneſs.</hi> Mal. iii.3. Remember he ſits to watch the gold in the furnace, and to regulate the heat. In proportion to the ſtate of the mind ſhall be the ſeverity of the fire of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction;
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:031228_0282_0FEAF870C01B3CA8"/>
and Chriſt frequently employs ſatan, wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, and hypocrites, ſkillful to afflict, to bring <hi>fuel</hi> to the furnace. Ah, Chriſtian! ſooner than your heart ſhall remain in a cold, ſtupid, prayerleſs, diſobedient ſtate, the furnace ſhall be made ſeven times hotter than it was wont to be made. Your being a ſubject of redeeming grace does not ſcreen you from ſuffering, nor gives you indulgence in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſloth; but, on the contrary, God will not ſuffer you long to remain in this ſtate: for, whom the Lord loveth he chaſteneth, and ſcourgeth every ſon whom he receiveth; and thoſe who are practically acquainted with a life of faith, know, that as ſure as they revolt from God in the frame of their hearts, and in the duties of the goſpel, an affliction of ſome ſort awaits them, to convince them of their folly.— The Prodigal left his father with apparent ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but a famine was produced, and brought him back again, weeping, to his father's arms.</p>
               <p>Sometimes the very object, means, or temptation by which a perſon was induced to revolt from God, is, by an over-ruling providence, made the means of reſtoration. The very idols which may have engroſſed your affections and decoyed your feet aſtray, ſhall either be daſhed in pieces before your eyes, or they ſhall be ſuffered to remain as thorns in your ſides, and ſpears in your heart, to convince you
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:031228_0283_0FEB76A1552F0110"/>
of your folly in departing from the Lord. Spiritual idolatry is one of the groſſeſt ſins, and never fails to lead the mind into ten thouſand evils, before we are aware. God is a jealous God over the people loves; he will not ſuffer a rival to remain long in their hearts; and he will caſt them out, and make us mourn with bitterneſs for our folly. David loved Abſolam inordinately, therefore Abſolam ſhall uſurp his father's throne, and prove an arrow in his father's heart. Solomon knew, by his own bitter experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that, <hi>the backſlider in heart ſhall be filled with his own ways.</hi> Prov. xiv.14. God can ſufficiently puniſh his own diſobedient children with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſending them to hell; for he can ſend an <hi>hell</hi> into them;—he can open the great deep of their own hard hearts; bring them to a recollection of their conduct; ſhew them the aggravations of their ſin, and make them loath themſelves for their abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations againſt him. They are thus filled with remorſe; they ariſe in indignation againſt themſelves; their wounds gape wide; and they feel the need of a phyſician's balm. Repentance flows from a broken heart, and faith again ventures upon the promiſe. <hi>He will turn again: He will have compaſſion upon us. Thou wilt ſubdue our iniquities, and thou wilt caſt all their ſins into the depths of the ſea.</hi> Mic. vii.19. From this perſuaſion the ſoul
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:031228_0284_0FEB76A7BA6F3A80"/>
returns again by prayer; finds God faithful to his promiſe, and receives the pledges of redeeming love.</p>
               <p>It is not unuſual with God to reſtore his wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering people, by the ſecret communication of HIM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SELF, without the uſe of any viſible means. <hi>The Lord turned, and looked upon Peter.</hi> Luke xxii.61. It was enough; his heart diſſolved; he remembered his ſin;—aſhamed and confounded, he retired, and wept. When the SUN OF RIGHTEOUSNESS ariſes upon the wanderer's mind, thoſe ſins which were committed with little conviction, now keenly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the heart.—He feels the darkneſs of his mind; regrets his extreme diſtance from the senſible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord, and adopts the language of David —<hi>Caſt me not away from thy preſence; and take not thy</hi> HOLY SPIRIT <hi>from me. Reſtore unto me the joy of thy ſalvation, and uphold me with thy free ſpirit.</hi> Pſ. li.11, 12. God ſecretly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulates with the ſoul,—<hi>O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied thee? teſtify againſt me?</hi> Mic. vi.3. All the tender feelings of the ſoul are awakened; he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches the Lord, who ſecretly whiſpers peace, ſheds abroad his love within the heart, and fixes its ſtanding more ſecure than it was before it fell.</p>
               <p>The ſenſibility of a reclaimed Chriſtian is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely great. His ſoul abhors the ſins, and ſhud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:031228_0285_0FEB76AAE8A13EC0"/>
at the path which led his feet aſtray;—he deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laments his diſtance from God, and the ſpiritual decay which ſuch perfidious conduct has produced in his ſoul. He no longer triumphs over the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections and miſcarriages of others, but culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates towards them the moſt tender compaſſion. He now proves the ſovereignty of grace, and the preciouſneſs of God's love, that preſerved his ſoul from hell, and brought him back with joy. He no longer truſts the attainments of his mind, nor the feelings of his heart; but puts his truſt alone in the protection of the Almighty. His views of Chriſt are more brilliant; his faith in him is more firm; and his love towards him is more ardent. It is impoſſible fully to deſcribe the fine feelings of ſuch a man's ſoul. Sufficient to ſay, it is the work of God, and worthy its Almighty Author. We learn from it, that God hates ſin e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>en in his own people; and in their reſtoration, he makes them feel its bitterneſs before he gladdens their hearts with his ſmiles. Let none, therefore, preſume; let none deſpair. Happy, unſpeakably happy are they who can ſing of reſtoring mercy—live in ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt union with a God of love; and, by faith, anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate the bright proſpect of eternity, where they ſhall be admitted to the immediate preſence of God and the Lamb; never, never more to wander fro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <l>IN various schemes my early days I spent,</l>
