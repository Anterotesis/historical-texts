            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="unknown:001321_0003_0FB2867A9BE9A910"/>
Iudgment,</hi> and of <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Eternal Life.</hi> Some of my Hearers having desired my <hi>Meditations</hi> might be Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished by the <hi>Press,</hi> and some of them having Contributed towards the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,</hi> I have singled out these few <hi>Sermons,</hi> and have Perused and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected the <hi>Notes,</hi> which were brought to me from one who wrote after me in <hi>Short-Hand.</hi> If there is in these a greater Inculcation and <hi>Laxness of Style,</hi> than in such as have been all written with my own Hand, the <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Reader</hi> will Excuse it; nor will that make them the less Edifying to them whose Edification is Chiefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by them.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Preparation for Death,</hi> and a greater Willingness to leave this Earth, and Holy Longings in the Hearts of Believers (and yet patient waiting for the Lords Coming) to be at <hi>Home</hi> with CHRIST in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> shall in any measure be the fruit of what is written, my Labour therein is not in Vain.</p>

               <pb facs="unknown:001321_0004_0FB2867BF91C1630"/>I knew an Aged and Eminent Minister of GOD, who for the space of Fourteen Years before his <hi>Death,</hi> continued Longing for his Dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I have seen the words I here Transcribe, written with his own Hand: <hi>Because</hi> (said he) <hi>God has l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t me see such Vanity and Emptiness in the best of those Comforts which this Life can afford, that I think I may truly say, that I have seen an End of all Perfection: Therefore if it were the Will of God, I should be glad to be removed hence, where the best that is to be had does yield so little Satisfaction to my Soul, and to be brought into His Presence in Glory, that there I might find (for there I know it is to be had) that Satisfying and Alsufficient Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Him, which under the Sun is not to be Enjoyed. In the mean time, I desire to stay the Lords Leisure. But, Thou, O Lord, how Long!</hi> Thus that Holy Man did Express his Holy Desires. This brings to mind <hi>Austin's</hi> Devout Reflection on those words, Exod. 33.20. <hi>There shall no man see
<pb facs="unknown:001321_0005_0FB286802BA90468"/>
me and Live.</hi> If it be so, then Lord let me Dye that so I may see thee.</p>
            <p>Old Mr. <hi>Iohn Dod</hi> (whom Mr. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell</hi> was wont to call <hi>Iohn the Divine</hi>) would be often Expressing his Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to be in Heaven: And altho' some said to him, they did not like a Servant that would have his wages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his work was done, that did not make him of another mind. Mr. <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drack Sympson</hi> speaks of a Good man who was ever and anon saying, <hi>I wish I were in Heaven.</hi> Unto those that blamed him, supposing he did not do well so frequently to wish himself there, he replied, <hi>Whether I do well in it or no, I am sure I wish I were there.</hi> Is it ill done for a Christian (with a Patient Submission to the Will of God) to wish he were in <hi>a World in which there is no Sin, and where IESVS CHRIST is to be seen in all His Glory? Ioh.</hi> 17.24. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23. It is reported of the Apostle <hi>Andrew,</hi> that when some were willing to have Endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Redemption of his Life <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

of the hands of his Enemies, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired them not to do it; and the reason he gave, was, that he did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly desire to be with CHRIST. The Good LORD give to me more of those Desires, and grant that both the Writer and the Readers, may Rejoyce together in the Heavenly &amp; Eternal World. In the mean Time it is matter of the deepest Humiliation to me, That altho' I have (after a poor manner the Lord knows) been Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Gospel (this Summer it will be) Fifty Years, I am not fully ripe for Heaven to this Day; For were I so, I should then be here no longer.</p>

            <p>THE Apostle in this Context, shews why it was necessary that the Son of God should Assume Humane Nature; Namely, that He might be capable of Suffering and Dying for the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of His People. If He had been

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> was necessary that the Son of God should become the Son of Man. In this with the preceding Verse, he mentions two very Blessed Effects of the Death of Christ.</p>
            <p n="1">1. One is, That thereby the Devil is destroyed: <hi>He thro' Death has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed the Dev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p n="2">2. Another Effect of Christs Death is in the words read, Nam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Delivered from: <hi>They are Delivered from Bondage.</hi> They were by the Curse of the Law in Bondage; bound over by the Law to suffer Death, not only Temporal but Eternal.

Altho' there are those in the world that through Faith and the Fear of God, are carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the fear of Death; Nevertheless, tis in it self considered a Formidable Evil; and is therefore called, <hi>The King of Terrors,</hi> Job 18.14. It exceeds o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Evils as much as a King exceeds other men. It is a most terrible thing: Job 24.17. <hi>They are in the Terrors of the shadow of Death.</hi> Look as there is nothing to Nature more pleasing and desirable than Life: Eccl. 11.7. <hi>Light is sweet</hi>; That is to say, the light of Life, that is sweet to Nature; and sayes <hi>Solomon, It is a pleasant thing to behold the light of the Sun</hi>: His mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, to live here in the world; For when men are in the dark Grave they behold the light of the Sun no more. So on the other hand, to be deprived of Life, to be subject to Death is the most unpleasant &amp; undesirable thing to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

that can be. And therefore it is that men Naturally do choose any thing rather than Death: Job 2.4. <hi>All that a man has will he give for his L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Enquiry may be, <hi>Whence is it so?</hi> How does it come to pass that Death is thus Formidable, that the thoughts of it does cause Fear and Dread to be upon the spirits of men naturally?</p>
                  <p>Answ. 1. <hi>A Cruel Enemy has by the Righteous Iudgment of God the Power of Death.</hi> The Devil is a Bloody E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy: In <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.3. he is called <hi>a Red Dragon,</hi> because he is a Bloody Devourer: And he has the Power of Death. And therefore the Jews of old were wont to call him by the name of <hi>the Angel of Death.</hi> The Angel that kills men they called by the name of <hi>Asmodaeus,</hi> which signifies a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyer</hi>; and so does the Scripture call him by the same Name; 1 Cor. 10.

It is then a tormenting thing to those Evil Spirits to think of the Wrath of God, and the Hell that is reserved for them. Thus it is with some Sinners on Earth; they are alwayes on the wrack with fear of Death and Hell. That miserable <hi>Francis Spira</hi> said, that he did believe that the Torment of Hell could not be more grievous, than that Fear he was in of going to Hell.
