            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>HAVING lately ſeen in the Journals of the Aſſembly of this Colony, held in 1758, a long Memorial, addreſſed to the Right Honorable the Lords Commiſſioners for Trade and Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, by the Merchants of London, in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of themſelves and of their Correſpondents, Merchants of <hi>Briſtol, Liverpool</hi> and <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> trading and intereſted in the Colony of <hi>Virginia,</hi> I cannot help entertaining you with ſome Obſervations upon it; and, that you may judge of the Juſtice with which they are made, I have traſcribed the whole Memorial, as it appears on the Journals aforeſaid.</p>

                        <p>That the General-Aſſembly of <hi>Virginia</hi> have lately paſſed an Act, whereby their Provincial Treaſurer is autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized, for the Purpoſes therein mentioned, to iſſue Paper Notes to the Amount of £. 80,000 which ſaid Paper Notes ſo iſſued and rated at Proclamation Money by the ſaid Act of Aſſembly, are thereby declared to be a lawful Tender in Payment of any Debt or Demand whatever, excepting his Majeſty's Quitrents.</p>
                        <p>That your Petitioners having very large Sums of Money now due to them in the ſaid Province, in the Way of Trade,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:008476_0003_102f5a0de8b43250"/>
upon Bargains and Contracts made with the Inhabitants of <hi>Virginia</hi>; and for, and on their Account, do moreover ſtand bound to the Tradeſmen in <hi>Great-Britain</hi> for large Sums: All which ſaid Bargains and Contracts, by general Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are payable in Sterling, or at the Rate of Sterling, lawful Money of this Kingdom; and were entered into, and concluded, long before the Iſſuing of ſuch Notes, and before any ſuch Traffick, by Way of Paper-Money, was known or heard of in the <hi>Virginia</hi> Trade.</p>
                        <p>Your Memorialiſts therefore beg Leave hereupon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate to your Lordſhips the very great Injury that may ariſe to the trading Intereſt of theſe Kingdoms, and more particularly to your Memorialiſts, from the <hi>Virginia</hi> Act, as it now ſtands; not only by Reaſon that it does affect Debts, Bargains and Contracts, due to the Merchants of theſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, expreſly ſtipulated payable to them, before the paſſing of the Act, in Sterling, or at the Rate of Sterling, lawful Money of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> but does moreover invert the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Trade, from a certain to an uncertain Value of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and Loſs: And, in ſo far, your Memorialiſts do conceive the ſaid Act to be arbitrary and unjuſt; arbitrary, becauſe it does, <hi>ex poſt facto,</hi> extend to Debts due on Bargains and Contracts made before the paſſing of the Act; unjuſt, by Reaſon that it does depreciate the Nature of ſuch Debts, by making Debts (payable in Sterling Money, of univerſal Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue) to be received in Paper Notes of a local, uncertain, and fluctuating Value, at the ſame Time that no Proviſion is made by the Act for making Payment in ſuch Notes <hi>ad va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorem</hi> of Sterling, according to the Difference of Exchange between ſuch Paper-Money and Sterling, when Payment is made; which Proviſion, on Principles of Law and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Equity, ought to have been made: In ſo far, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as that your Memorialiſts may be very great Sufferers from the Defects in the ſaid Act as it now ſtands, as well as from a Clauſe in one other Act that paſſed in the ſaid Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince <hi>Anno</hi> 1748, intituled, <hi>An Act delaring the Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Executions, and for the Relief of inſolvent Debtors, whereby Executions for Sterling Debts ſhall be levied in current Money, at the Rate of</hi> 25 per Cent. <hi>Advance on Sterling for the Difference of Exchange, and not otherwiſe.</hi>

And that all Bargains or Contracts that have been heretofore made, or that may hereafter be made and entered into, in the Courſe of Trade or otherwiſe, between theſe Kingdoms and <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia,</hi> if the ſame ſhall be expreſly ſtipulated and made pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able according to Sterling or lawful Money of <hi>Great-Britain</hi>; that then and in ſuch Caſes ſuch Paper Notes ſo iſſued or that hereafter may be iſſued, or any other Species of Current Money not being Sterling, ſhall not be deemed a lawful Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in Payment of any ſuch Debt, Bargain, or Contract, ſo entered into, payable in Sterling or lawful Money of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> unleſs the Perſon or Perſons to whom ſuch Payment is tendered in Paper Notes or in any other Species of Current Money ſhall think proper to accept thereof in ſuch Paper Notes or other Species of Current Money, if the ſame ſhall be offered to him or them, according to the Difference of Exchange between ſuch Paper Notes and other Species of Current Money, at the Time when ſuch Paper Notes or other Species of Current Money ſhall be ſo offered in Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Sterling Debts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that the Perſon or Perſons ſo accepting of Payment in Paper Notes or in any other Species of Current Money, according to the Difference of Exchange between Sterling and Paper Curency, and ſuch other Species of Current Money, ſhall be deemed and held as fully paid and ſatisfy'd for his and their Debts to all Intents and Purpoſes as if ſuch Payment had been made in Sterling

or lawful Money of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> any thing in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Act or in any other Act to the contrary notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                        <p>To an Amendment of this Nature your Memorialiſts conceive the Aſſembly of <hi>Virginia</hi> can make no Objection, in ſo far as that it is <hi>bonâ fide</hi> founded on Principles of common Juſtice and the Laws of this Kingdom, and more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly agreeable to the Act of the Sixth Year of her late Majeſty Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> whereby foreign Silver is made Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in the Plantations, but in due Proportion as the intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick Value thereof is to Sterling. And at the ſame Time it is thereby provided that all ſuch Species of Silver Coin ſo made Current ſhall not affect Contracts or Bargains made prior to the Act. And it is thereby further provided that nothing in the ſaid Act ſhall be conſtrued to compel any Perſon or Perſons whatſoever to receive in Payment any of the ſaid Species of ſuch foreign Silver Coin as the ſame is rated in the Act. In ſo far therefore as that the Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment propoſed by your Memorialiſts to the Act of <hi>Virginia,</hi> coincides with Equity and the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> and with the Regard that is at all Times due to the trading Intereſt of theſe Kingdoms, and with the Juſtice due to your Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialiſts in this particular Caſe.</p>
                        <p>From ſuch Conſiderations your Memorialiſts hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly hope for your Lordſhips Interpoſition with his Majeſty for an Inſtruction to the Governor of <hi>Virginia,</hi> for the Purpoſes aforeſaid, and that your Lordſhips will be pleaſed to ſuſpend giving Judgment upon the <hi>Virginia</hi> Act as it now ſtands by way of Approbation thereof, 'til ſuch Time as the Senſe of the Aſſembly of that Province is had upon the Amendments propoſed thereto.</p>

            <p>AS to the Memorial, by Way of general Obſervation, I ſay, it appears from the Complexion of it, to be a Performance wholely dictated by an uncommon Kind of Partiality, and the groſſeſt Species of Weakneſs imaginable: For from the word<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, it is evident, that it is but of very late Date that any Paper Money was heard of in <hi>Virginia.</hi> It would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have been but Juſtice, previou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to any Complaint in an Inſtance ſo rare, and new, to have made ſome Enquiry
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:008476_0006_102f59ebc9803c58"/>
into the Cauſe of making ſuch an Act; eſpecially if it is attended with ſuch dreadful Conſequences as it is repreſented to be. They would then have found that not only extreme <hi>Poverty,</hi> but even extreme <hi>Danger,</hi> united to compel the Colony to fall on ſome Expedient for raiſing Money to defray the Expences of an Army that they were under the greateſt Neceſſity imaginable of collecting together, to ſecure themſelves againſt the rapid Incurſions of a cruel and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>Enemy.</hi> And that before they attempted to ſubſtitute Paper or any Thing in Lieu of what I find is by Merchants only called, Money, they had uſed every Method of borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Money at a greater Intereſt than common, and if I am not much miſtaken, Application was even made to ſome of theſe complaining Gentlemen, but with very little Succeſs. Such an Enquiry would not only have explained the Cauſe of making ſuch an Act, by ſhewing the Dilemma that the Country was in (for altho' many Gentlemen diſcovered on the Occaſion a truly Patriot Spirit, yet it was impoſſible for private Fortunes to go any ſerviceable Length in ſuch an Affair) but it might poſſibly have convinced Men, calling ſo loudly for <hi>Equity, Law, Juſtice,</hi> and what not, that ſuch an Act was exceedingly proper, and indeed well prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented; for we find even limited Monarchies and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths have done the ſame Thing in ſuch diſtreſſed Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances: Some have coined in the Field, and others have ſubſtituted baſer Metals in the Room of Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver which they had not, to anſwer their preſſing Occaſions. Surely then they who ſhall apply the Words <hi>Arbitrary</hi> and <hi>Unjuſt</hi> to a Tranſaction truely ſimilar as to its Circumſtances, to what has before been deemed neceſſary and paſſed uncen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, muſt either be very bad Haberdaſhers of Epithets, or Men of low and ſelfiſh Notions. Should it be ſaid that <hi>Virginia</hi> ought not to be conſidered with reſpect to its Power of making Laws in the Light of a limited Monarchy or Commonwealth; I anſwer that whenever any People are reduced to the before mentioned Neceſſity, it is an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable Argument for the Exertion of every Degree of Power, ſince it is certainly ultimately exerciſed for the abſolute Benefit of that very State from which a Power of the ſame Nature muſt neceſſarily have been granted, had
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:008476_0007_102f5a1469cdb0d0"/>
it been near enough to have extended it in a proper Time: Such a Power therefore is always imply'd in the very Nature of Things, let the Degree of Subjection be what it will; and the Conſequence of its not being ſo, would in the Caſe of any potent and ſudden Invaſion be the Loſs of the Colony to that very State which claims the Subjection, unleſs Matters ſhall be conducted hereafter with much greater Precaution, than has hitherto been experienced. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any Thing that may be advanced againſt this Argument with Reſpect to the diſtreſſed Situation of the Colony, on Account of the Aſſiſtance ſent to it under General <hi>Braddock,</hi> or the £. 20000 remitted to the Honorable <hi>Robert Dinwid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,</hi> the then Governor; I ſay in the former Inſtance, it was more diſtreſſed by the Defeat ſuffered, than it was before the Aſſiſtance was ſent; for the unexpected Victory in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired the Enemy, with greater Boldneſs, and if poſſible leſſened their Humanity. In the Inſtance of the Money, the Perſon intruſted is perhaps able to aſſign ſome Reaſon why not more than £. 800 was expended, or apply'd to the Uſe of the Colony, or Maintenance of their Army.</p>
            <p>AND here I think I ought to be a little explicit, and diſcloſe a Matter ſomewhat ſcandalous in the tranſacting. Mr. <hi>Dinwiddie,</hi> from a general Foreſight in turning the Penny (always diſtinguiſhable in him) having ordered certain Neceſſaries for the Uſe of the Forces, under the Command of General <hi>Braddock,</hi> refuſed abſolutely to diſcharge the Accounts of the Perſons employ'd to procure the ſame to the Amount of £. 1236-11-2, pretending that he could not regularly carry thoſe Articles to Account with the Government in <hi>England,</hi> and by frequent Solicitations to the Committee appointed for the Diſpoſal of the Money raiſed here for the Defence of the Colony, he engaged them to pay that Sum under a moſt ſolemn Promiſe of ſubjecting to their Order £. 5000 that remained in his Hands out of the above mentioned £. 20000, which he alledged might be regularly done, as that Money was remitted to him for the Uſe of the Colony; but when the Aſſembly addreſſed him to diſpoſe of a Part of that £. 5000 for building a Fort in the <hi>Cherokee</hi> Country; a Thing recommended to them as neceſſary to

preſerve the Friendſhip of thoſe People, he returned for Anſwer, that he had no more remaining in his Hands of the above £. 20000 than the £. 800 before mentioned; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly no more than that Sum was apply'd as is before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. So that the Country inſtead of being benefitted by that Remittance from <hi>England,</hi> was not a little injured in as much as it was properly ſpeaking the Means of their looſing £. 435-11-2 of their own Money in this inſtance alone. I might add further, that at the Time the above Sum of £. 20000 was in that Gentleman's Hands, or at his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, he was graciouſly pleaſed to lend the Country the Sum of £. 3000 at the exorbitant Intereſt of Six per Cent. which was punctually paid him. Theſe Facts are too true to be deny'd, and although the Sum perhaps may be too trifling for the Enquiry of a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament, yet certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as it was a very glaring Abuſe of the good Intentions of the People of <hi>England,</hi> it ſeems but juſt that the Public ſhould be ſatisfy'd with an impartial Examination into the Conduct of that Gentleman, in this Particular at leaſt, ſince from his own Mouth, we have been informed that the M—y at Home had complimented him with £. 2000 of that Money as a Recompence for his extraordinary Care in the Diſpoſal of it.</p>
            <p>NOW as this was the Situation of the Country, could any Thing but mere <hi>Partiality</hi> and <hi>Weakneſs</hi> dictate a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint againſt an Act ſo immediately conducive to its Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. Thus far I obſerve of the Memorial in general, I ſhall now treat it in a more particular Manner, and purſue it as paragraphically as may be in order to ſhew that the <hi>Partiality</hi> with which I charge it, is of ſuch a Nature as will not endure a Diſguiſe even with the falſe Shew of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning which ſeems to have been purpoſely adapted quite thro' it.</p>
            <p n="1">I. WE are told that the Paper Notes emitted by the Act are by it declared to be a lawful Tender in Payment of any Debt or Demand whatever (excepting his Majeſty's Quitrents.) I agree it is ſo declared in the Act, and of what Uſe would ſuch Notes have been, or to what Purpoſe ſhould they have
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:008476_0009_102f5a176f47a340"/>
been iſſued at all, if they were not to be Current in all Caſes. Gentlemen may attempt to gloſs over their Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours by talking of Expedients for making the Act ſervicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the <hi>military Purpoſes</hi> for which it was intended, and yet not general as to the Currency of theſe Notes; but I beg Leave to ſay it is nothing more than a Piece of artful Nonſenſe; for what are the military Services of Money, but the paying of the Soldiers, and purchaſing the Stores neceſſary for War; and could any Man be hired to fight for a Caſh that he could not pay his Debts with, but at the Option of his Creditor? And who is there that would part with any Kind of Stores for a Piece of Paper that ſhould only be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful at the Will of another that might think proper to deal with him? If then it is neceſſary that ſuch Notes ſhould be a current Tender in ſuch Caſes; why not in all Caſes? Why is a Debt in <hi>England</hi> of greater Dignity? Kings indeed have a juſt Right to ſuch Exceptions, their privy Purſes ought alawys to be kept ſacred from any Touch, but that of the laſt Inſtance: But Subjects have no Pretence to Immunities, one more than another, they muſt all equally enjoy an Advantage, or ſuffer a Calamity whenever it at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends a Community. And I hope I am not arguing with Perſons who do not think <hi>Virginia</hi> a Part of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity. Had this Law been calculated on the Footing of the <hi>Expedient,</hi> propoſed by the Memorialiſts to their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, it would have carried its own Inſignificancy; that is, it would not have anſwered its Intention of raiſing Men for the War, which was neceſſarily aimed at; but I ſhall treat the <hi>Expedient</hi> in a more reſpectful Manner by taking full Notice of it, when it comes in its Turn, and I believe ſhew, however prettily it might read in a Countinghouſe, it would meet with a quite different Fate at a Bar of Equity.</p>
            <p n="2">II. WE are told in what Manner the Merchants are affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Act.
<q>The Inhabitants of the Colony are indebted to them in large Sums of Money. Furthermore the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants on Account of theſe Inhabitants are bound to the Tradeſmen of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> in large Sums; both of which were by general Agreement payable in Sterling, or at the Rate of Sterling, and this by Contracts concluded long before the iſſuing of any Paper Money in <hi>Virginia.</hi>
               </q>

               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:008476_0010_102f59eed7203250"/>I THINK we have here a Declaration of the whole Cauſe of their Complaint, that is, 1ſt, The Planters we indebted to them; 2dly, They are furthermore indebted to them; for I am perſuaded however artfully they may have divided on this Article of Debt, it is but one and the ſame Thing, that is, a Debt to the Merchants from the Planters; but it ſeems to have been neceſſary here to repreſent the whole City, nay the ſeveral Kingdoms of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> likely to be endangered by this Act, in order to raiſe the greater Clamor againſt it. I ſhall not do Juſtice to the Weakneſs of this Paragraph, if I do not here take Notice of a Diſcovery made by it, that I am ſure many Merchants of the City of <hi>London,</hi> have deny'd to be the Caſe when charged with it in private Letters. We have had many of us for ſome Time paſt, great Reaſon to own the Thing is unhappily true in the firſt Inſtance, of our being indebted. Unhappily in as much as the Generality of Creditors are a Kind of lording Tyrants over their unfortunate Debtors, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the undoubted Securities pledged, and the annual Tribute paid in, of a very high tho' lawful Intereſt. And to this we do attribute (and we preſume with great Truth too) the Growth of many Innovations and <hi>arbitrary</hi> Charges (to uſe the Gentlemen's own Language) that have been and are every now and then brought to Account to keep the poor Dogs of Debtors deep in their Books, and render the Redemption of their Freedom impoſſible, by thus lowering the Produce of their Commodity, that they may continue under the Obligation of ſending it to them alone, thro' Fear of more apparent Perſecutions. I ſay this we knew, and we have had great Reaſon to believe (that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Merchants always took Care to carry every Article of Goods as ſoon as ſhipped to the Account of the Planter) they were nevertheleſs in Arrears to the Tradeſmen for them, from their being ſo obſervably rated above the ſame Things purchaſed with ready Money; but it was never cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly known to be ſo till this Declaration made, which I call a <hi>Diſcovery,</hi> and I am much miſtaken if they were aware of making it, the Time they were endeavouring to intereſt others in their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Complaints Now tho' this artful Diviſion of theirs is but a weak <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="12" facs="unknown:008476_0011_102f5a18f7ed17c8"/>
to us a prodigious Aggravation of the Misfortunes of thoſe that are indebted to them, in as much as they are not only obliged to pay dearer, for the Neceſſaries they ſend for, from the advanced Price of the Tradeſmen, always added for long Credit given; but are loaded with Intereſt in the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants Accounts on that advanced Price; which muſt needs be a large annual Sum out of the Profits of the Colony, put into the Pocket of the Merchant; a Practice not ſo well founded as to admit of a common Juſtification: But I ſhall forbear to conſider this any further here, as it is an Article that may one Day make a very good Figure amongſt many others, in a Complaint from this Side of the Water, when the Leiſure of a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament ſhall admit of an Enquiry into the real Cauſes of the diſtreſſed Situation of their Colonies; and ſome truly noble Spirit ſhall glory in exerting itſelf for that Benefit, which has ſo long been deſired. — Let the Attempt be thine, O FAUQUIER, to complete thy Goodneſs, thine to explode and remove all unnatural and deſtructive Jealouſies, and by thy Happineſs demonſtrate to diſtant and ſucceeding Delegations, that it is the Patriot GOVERNOR alone that can repreſent the Patriot KING. Nor deem thou this as a Drop bubling from the nauſeous Fountain of Flattery: No 'tis the Dictate of a Mind that enjoys more than Kings can confer, <hi>a contented Condition</hi>; a Mind that has no Demand againſt thee but what muſt centre in its <hi>Country</hi>'s <hi>Good</hi>; a Mind that diſdains all Praiſe or Commendation to any dignify'd Character but ſuch as is made truly glorious by <hi>public Virtue.</hi> Now let me aſk the Gentlemen how a Debt from the Planters to the Merchants came to be made an Introduction to their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints. It does indeed ſhew a Connection they have with the Colony, but I beg Leave to ſay, they are not in that Connection, in the leaſt affected by any new Thing in the Act. They acknowledge the Debts due from the Colony, were by general Agreement diſchargeable in <hi>Sterling or at the Rate of Sterling Money</hi>; and does this Act ſay they ſhall not be ſo diſcharged? No, nor was it ever intended to oper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate in ſuch a Manner; it ſays indeed, that the Paper Notes ſo iſſued, ſhall be a lawful Tender in Payment of any Debt or Demand whatever, and theſe Words do expreſly imply
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:008476_0012_102f59f5ae104450"/>
               <hi>ad valorem,</hi> with Reſpect to Sterling Debts, and it is not in the Power of the moſt quibbling Petyfogger to cavil long enough to draw any other Meaning out of them. 'Tis a known Rule in the Conſtruction of Statutes, that two Acts equally ſubſiſting ſhall only operate in the Manner in which they are truly reconcileable, and this for a very good Reaſon, otherwiſe every new Statute muſt be extended ſo as to take in all the Laws that are relative to the Matter contained in ſuch Statute, which would be perhaps conſtructing a Volume every Seſſion of Parliament too large for any one Man's Peruſal, and might be productive of great Confuſion, which is too often the Caſe in frequent Reviſals. When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a ſubſiſting Act has fully regulated any Matter or Thing, a ſucceeding Statute not expreſly or virtually repealing it, ſhall not be extended to defeat the Purpoſe of the preceeding Act. I will exemplify it in the Caſe before us, to ſhew the Juſtice of it, tho' there ſeems to be little Need of any Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plification, as there is ſcarcely a Book treating of Statutes that does not confirm it. There was an Act made in 1748, which the Memorialiſts have recited, declaring that Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for Sterling Debts ſhould be levied in Current Money at the Rate of Twenty-five per Cent. Advance on Sterling, and not otherwiſe. The Act in the Paper Emiſſion in no Part either virtually or expreſly repeals or contradicts it; can the Clauſe then, allowing the Tender of Paper Notes in Payment of any Debt whatever, mean with Reſpect to Sterling Debts any Thing elſe, but that ſuch Tender ſhall be made according to the Act in Force, before the making the Act for Paper Emiſſion, and was that Law in 1748 ſtill in Force could ſuch Tender made under the Paper Act be good, unleſs it had been made at the Rate of Twenty-five per Cent. And as this was the then <hi>ad valorem</hi> between Sterling and Currency, how can the Merchant be affected by the Paper Act, as to his Sterling Debt, Bargain, or Contract. This may be a Method out of the Way of Reaſoning with theſe Gentlemen, but if they will wade in Waters that they are Strangers to, they ſhould apply to thoſe who are acquainted with them, before they ruſh into Fears and Apprehenſions and expoſe themſelves by mere groundleſs Complaints. From hence it appears any other Conſtruction upon the Act com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:008476_0013_102f5a1dd4c2ae98"/>
of would be againſt the Rule of Law, and I muſt ſay, againſt the Rule of common Senſe too, for they might as well in my Opinion, carry the Tender in the Act to a Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Debt in Tobacco, which would be an Abſurdity, if there was no Limitation of the Words to be allowed. The Gentlemen muſt now excuſe me if I tell them, that altho' they have laid their Complaint againſt the Act, in the Defect of it with Reſpect to a Proviſion for Sterling Debts; I cannot think that they or their Draftſman were really ſo ignorant as not to know, that this Act did not ſtand in Need of any ſuch Clauſe; but that by the amending Clauſe in the Expedient propoſed to their Lordſhips, they intended ſome Thing further, and that their ſole Motive for complaining was, that they ſhould not be obliged to take theſe Notes at any Rate at all, but as they pleaſed. Should this be the Caſe, they are not only Men of very <hi>inhumane Principles,</hi> but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their long Practice in the Arts of Profit and Loſs, very bad <hi>Politicians,</hi> as to their particular Intereſt. <hi>Inhumane</hi> in that they would either compel a Man to do an Impoſſibility, (viz.) Pay a Debt in a particular Coin, when it is not in his Power to acquire one Penny of it to do it with, or elſe pay it in ſuch a Manner, as would oblige him to Part with all that he has: For if there was to be no Reſtriction ſet as to the Value of Sterling Money, and the Difference wholly left to the Will of the Creditor, it would be veſting ſuch Creditor with the moſt arbitrary Rule in the World, and from the very Nature of complaining in all ſuch Caſes, it would be giving up the Debtor and his dependent Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as a Sacrifice to the certain Cruelty of the Creditor; for he that growls at the wholſome Reſtrictions Society ſhall think proper to eſtabliſh between Man and Man, can only do it from an incompaſſionate and devouring Temper; in vain is Charity to be expected from him who contends againſt Laws that have Charity for their Baſis. In <hi>England</hi> indeed where all the Currency they have is a rated Sterling, there can be no Occaſion for a Law of this Kind to enable the Debtor to ſtop the Perſecutions of his Creditor; but in Countries where Sterling is a Coin very little ſeen, ſuch a Law is not only ſalutary for the Community, but highly Equitable and Juſt, between Man and Man, that they ſhould
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:008476_0014_102f59f741368430"/>
be permitted to diſcharge their Money Debts, of what Kind or Nature ſoever, in the Currency of the Country in which they live, and it is the true Buſineſs of the Legiſlature to keep ſuch Laws at all Times ſubſiſting; for Man left to his own Will over his Fellow Creatures, may ſometimes fall into ſuch Depravations of Mind, as to become more cruel than the moſt Savage Beaſt of Prey. As to their Politicks, I need only put a Caſe founded on a real Fact, to ſhew how bad they are with Reſpect to their Debts. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a People to be ſo circumſtanced as to have no Sterling at all amongſt them, and very little of any other Coin, how can ſuch a People be ever able to pay their Debts; few Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities beſides their Tobacco can be exported to any certain Market, but in the Way of Barter; their Tobacco ſeldom yields much more in <hi>England</hi> in common Crops, than is ſufficient to purchaſe Neceſſaries and pay Intereſt; and ſhould an accidental foreign Trade ſend a little of its Gold into that Country, a Tender <hi>ad valorem</hi> of that Gold, muſt neceſſarily be allowed, or that would be of little Service; if then it muſt be allowed in the Caſe of one ſpecies of Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency, why ſhould it not in all Kinds; would it not then be much eaſier for ſuch Merchants to get their Debts paid by an eſtabliſhed circulating Currency, than by none at all: A Debt ſo paid might in the Round of Trade (which Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers are well acquainted with) be carried Home to <hi>England,</hi> and there centre in Sterling, with a very fair and conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Profit. I will now aſk where is the material Difference between one Kind of Currency and another with Reſpect to Trade or Debts; but I bar the Man of miſerly Habits from giving any Anſwer at all, he is firſt for the moſt Part a Stranger either to Trade or Debts, becauſe he can ſcarcely truſt himſelf, how then will he truſt another. Again, the Wretch conceives ſuch an inexpreſſible Pleaſure in the counting and poring over his Golden Guineas, that I much queſtion whether double the Sum in Bank-Bills would pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe them. 'Tis to the rational Trader alone that I apply, and ſuch Merchants ought to be deemed; to them therefore I addreſs myſelf, and I am perſuaded I have their true Anſwer in this Memorial.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:008476_0015_102f5a1f5b1e1bb0"/>THEY tell us, the Act for emitting Paper-Money is unjuſt, by Reaſon that it depreciates the Nature of Sterling Debts, by making what was payable in a Coin of univerſal Value, payable in Notes of a local, uncertain, and fluctuating Value: If I underſtand theſe Terms right, we are to collect from them, that the Value of Sterling is univerſally agreed upon; and that Paper Notes have no Value at all, out in the Place they are made current; and that even the Value there is uncertain, becauſe of its Fluctuation with Reſpect to the Value of Sterling: The material Difference between Paper and Sterling muſt then lye in the Certainty of the one, and in the Uncertainty of the other. And is it not evident, that all other Species of Coin, with Reſpect to Sterling, are of the ſame uncertain Nature as Paper? Neither can Gold and Silver Coin be leſs ſo than Paper, as it muſt be rated by Sterling, the Scarcity or Plenty of which will certainly lower or advance the exchanging Difference; and to ſay that Gold and Silver Coin is current in more Places than the Paper Currency is, and therefore though local yet leſs confined, is but a Kind of begging the Queſtion, and when it is granted, it makes very little in the Point, for in thoſe Countries where Gold and Silver Coin are not current by Law, they are only to be conſidered as a trading Commodity, which is more or leſs vendible in Proportion to the Gain or Profit that is to be made by it, and there can be no Inſtance in which a Paper Currency that can be remitted to the Country where it is made current by Law, will not be as good a Commodity in Trade as Gold and Silver, but one; that is, where the trafficking or exchanging Difference between Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and Sterling is greater than the intrinſick Difference; and as this can only happen from the too great Scarcity of Sterling Trade, ſhould an Inſtance or two depending upon ſuch an Accident be made ſuch an Argument of as to decry a Paper Currency, when in every other Caſe it is equal to all other Coins, except Sterling: And as to Trade or Debts, I beg Leave to ſay they cannot be affected by it, for the Trader has it always in his Power to ſuit his Trade to his expected Payments; and the Sterling Debt, when paid in Paper, will always be paid in the exchanging Difference that is then circulating: To be injured, therefore, by the Paper Notes, the Trader or Creditor muſt put a Caſe that can only
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:008476_0016_102f59f8c722cc28"/>
center in his own Neglect or Avarice; his Neglect, in not negociating it away in Time, before Exchange ſhall riſe; Avarice, in keeping it by him, in Expectation that the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change is ſtill falling, and from thence propoſing a farther Gain to himſelf. Thoſe who tell us, that Paper Currency has a farther Difference from Gold and Silver Coins, in that it is difficult to be realized; if they mean it is difficult to turn an Eſtate in Paper Notes into a landed, or any other permanent Eſtate, I anſwer it cannot be more ſo in that than it would be in other Coins, when the Act is conſidered; for that does abſolutely bar all Difference between them, and when an Eſtate becomes vendible, it cannot by Law be of more Value in one than another: A Man, indeed, of a miſerly Diſpoſition might be tempted to part with a Tract of Land for Gold, when he would not for Paper; but that Gold he muſt keep uſeleſs, or clandeſtinely exchange it; for if he does it openly, he can get no more for it than if it was Paper. Should a Man want to realize it, as they call it in <hi>England,</hi> he can as eaſily exchange it for Bills as Gold, if he does not care to venture it in the Commodity of the Country; and in no Inſtance does it differ with Reſpect to realizing from Gold and Silver Coins, but in the before-mentioned one, where the Plenty of ſuch Coin ſhall ſo far exceed the Sterling Trade, as to make the exchanging Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference greater than the intrinſick: And thus, at laſt, does this Difficulty of realizing become greater in the one than the other, by the ſame Accident which I have before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and which muſt be ſo rare as ſcarcely to happen twice in a Man's Life. I am pretty well ſatiſfied, that theſe Arguments againſt the <hi>Virginia</hi> Paper Currency have been adopted from the Practice of other Colonies, where they have both Gold and Silver, and Paper Currencies, at a great Difference with Reſpect to each other; but it ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that it is there a profitable Trade to the cunning Merchants, and that no Proviſion (as I am informed) was ever made againſt it in the Acts that emitted the Paper: But in <hi>Virginia</hi> this is in a great Meaſure prevented, and will be more ſo, as the Iniquities of ſuch Trade ſhall from Time to Time be diſcovered; but here I beg Pardon for a Digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:008476_0017_102f5a20e3c5ca88"/>
I ſhall now conſider the <hi>Arbitrarineſs,</hi> and Injuſtice charged on the Act by the Memorialiſts.</p>
            <p>THE Act they ſay not only inverts the Nature of Trade from a certain to an uncertain Value of Profit and Loſs; but it extends <hi>ex poſt facto</hi> to Debts due on Bargains and Contracts made before the Paſſing of the Act, and therefore it is <hi>arbitrary.</hi> I was ſomething puzzled to fix a Meaning to the certain Value of Profit and Loſs in Trade, which this Act has overſet, becauſe from all the Ideas I could collect of Trade, it can have very little Certainty in it; there is always a Probability in it, and ſome Trades are more probable as to their Succeſs than others; but as I know it was a Complaint againſt the Act, I have endeavoured to extract a Meaning out of it: That is, that before the Making of the Act, they uſed to Trade for Sterling only, which they call a Trade of certain Value, and ſince the Act they are obliged to Trade for Paper Currency, which is of uncertain Value. If this is the Accuſation, I beg Leave to ſay, it is a Miſtake, for they did not, nor could they trade any more for Sterling before the Making of the Act, than they do, or can ſince the Act; that is before the Act there was always a ſubſiſting Currency in the Country, which they were obliged to take in Exchange for Sterling, trade how they would, and this Act does no more than introduce a new Kind of Currency, which theſe Gentlemen, as I have already ſhewn, are only pleaſed to think meanly of, not that it materially differs from the Currency that ſubſiſted before the making of the Act: Their Accuſation therefore as to its inverting of Trade, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is vague and idle, and their <hi>ex poſt facto</hi> is of the ſame Stamp; they are Words that do not deſerve my Notice, only to expoſe the Scheme couched in them, they know they give a retroſpective Caſt to the Act, and ſuch is the popular Cry againſt a Retroſpection in Statutes, that it is like bawling out a mad Dog in the Streets, which has been the Cauſe of violent Deaths to many an harmleſs and uſeful Cur. But I will firſt ſatisfy thoſe who ſhall read me, that it is a Complaint ill founded, and then ſhew theſe Gentlemen, that whatever the common and vulgar Opinion may be of retroſpective Acts, they may be the moſt ſalutary Acts imaginable to a Community in ſome Inſtances.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:008476_0018_102f59fc053e8b68"/>1ſt, 'TIS ſaid the Act does <hi>ex poſt facto</hi> extend to Debts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> due before the Making of the Act. I ſay no Part of this is true, but that the Debts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were contracted before the Act: And how does this Act extend to ſuch Debts? In no other Manner than what they were always extended to, and muſt from the very Nature of Things have been extended to as ſoon as ever a Debt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> could poſſibly have been contracted: I ſay it muſt from the very Nature and Reaſon of Things, have been a Rule that every Perſon trading from <hi>Great-Britain</hi> in a Country where the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Currency of that Country was of leſs Value than Sterling, that ſuch Trader ſhould be obliged to take his Debt or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract in ſuch Country, at ſome certain Diſcount, between the Currency of ſuch Country and Sterling, or he muſt have traded ſolely by Barter; and if any one will give himſelf the Trouble of enquiring Back into the Hiſtory of Exchange and Trade in this Colony, he will find that for a long Time, the Riches of the People, lying more in Sterling than Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency, from that over Balance, the Difference of Exchange was firſt on the Side of Currency. I can charge my Memory with having read old Letters, wherein one per Cent. Sterling, was given for one Hundred Pounds Currency. And this ſeems to be the Reaſon of thoſe Acts now ſubſiſting amongſt us (tho' very little regared) prohibiting the Exportation of Caſh under large Penalties, and of thoſe other Acts (now ſo iniquitouſly extended) giving Encouragement for the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Caſh: In Time as the Quantity of Caſh encreaſed, Sterling claimed a ſuperior Value, and as the Riches of the Country declined in Sterling, the exchanging Value en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed; during all which Time the Trader muſt have ſuited himſelf to the Poſſibility of his Chapman, and the Creditor to that of his Debtor; but when Men became ſo extravagant as to pay no Regard to ſocial Good, but governed their Demands wholly by Avarice, let it undo where it would; then the Law in 1748, came in to Remedy the Evil where it could, by taking Cognizance of the Claim of the Creditor, and ſo ultimately confining the Trader; and if he could not be contented with a reaſonable Exchange, the Proceſs brought againſt the Debtor, ended in a Regulation
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:008476_0019_102f5a28cc8d8bf8"/>
of the Exchange between Sterling and Currency, as the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture then thought was moſt reaſonable: But this Limitation of Exchange to a certain Standard always, was by theſe very Gentlemen exclaimed againſt (as I ſhall ſhew them preſently, to give the World the true Complexion of this Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial) and the Legiſlature then fell on the beſt and moſt equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Rule, than can be deviſed by Man, for the diſpenſing of Juſtice to the Creditor and preſerving the unfortunate Debtor from his mercileſs Claws; by directing Courts to Rate the Value of their Sterling Judgments given, in Current Money, according to the general and moſt known exchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Difference ſo that the Creditor, was juſtly dealt with, and always had Caſh in ſuch a Proportion, as might enable him to replace his Sterling Debt in <hi>England,</hi> if he pleaſed. Thus the Rule, which Reaſon and Nature dictated ſhould be ſubſiſting, became the Rule eſtabliſhed by Law, and did ſubſiſt before the Act, for emitting Paper Currency. I hope it is now evident the Act has done nothing <hi>ex poſt facto,</hi> it has enacted no new Thing with Regard to any Sort of Debts, but only directed that for ſuch a Time, ſuch Notes ſhould have all the Value, that any other Species of Currency had: If it ſhould be ſaid that although Sterling Judgments were before the Act, to be rated in Currency, yet ſuch Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency was no Tender in Law, at it is in this Act; I anſwer, it is a mere Lawyer's Quibble, and if it was not expreſly declared ſo in former Acts, yet it was virtually, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentially ſo done, in that every Creditor muſt know he could recover no more than the real Difference of Exchange; and ſurely that Court where it ſhould appear that the Debtor had made the Creditor a Tender of the full Exchange on his Debt, muſt have treated ſuch Creditor on his Refuſal, as a litigious Perſon.</p>
            <p>AS to retroſpective Statutes, I need do no more than mention a common Propoſition, to prove that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing popular Clamor, they are often very expedient. Let a preceeding Tranſaction be what it will, it may be produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of very great Evil to a Community by its Effects, and ſhall a Community go on to endure this Evil, becauſe it was produced by an Action done before the Evil was experienced:
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:008476_0020_102f5a02b6c5a310"/>
To ſay they ought is to fix the Infallibility of human Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, as to Cauſes, Effects, and Conſequences, which is an Abſurdity. A Retroſpection therefore in ſuch Caſes, is not only ſalutary, but abſolutely neceſſary, to deſtroy ſuch Effects even if it is obliged to reach the Cauſe: Suppoſe for Inſtance there had been no Rule or Law ſubſiſting to oblige a Creditor to accept of an adequate Exchange for his Sterling Debt in Currency; I ſay from the apparent Neceſſity there was of making this Act to raiſe Men and Money, which has been ſhewn beyond Contradiction, it was abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the Good of the Community, that the Act ſhould be ſo made, as to take in the Creditor before the Act, or elſe ſuch Creditor might have defeated the main Purpoſe of the Act (that of providing an Army) in refuſing to be ſatisfy'd for his Debt by the Notes, and would not ſuch a Proceeding in Creditors, have ſtruck at the very Vitals of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, by leaving the Land defenceleſs, and in the Power of the Ravages of the Enemy.</p>
            <p>THE Injuſtice wherewith this Act is charged, in depreciating Debts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> has been fully anſwered, in the Arguments already uſed, which ſhew that neither Trade or Debt, are or can in the leaſt, be affected by the Act; the very Defect they hint at in the Act (that is the Want of a Proviſo for paying Sterling Debts <hi>ad valorem</hi>) is nothing more than a Defect in their own Brain; they either have not read the Laws of the Country, or are diſturbed that all the Laws are not every Seſſion brought into one Law, and what a mighty Law would that be! In Fact, the Clauſe they want was long before this Act enacted, and in ſome Meaſure at their own Inſtance, which I ſhall now ſhew in their next Paragraph of Complaint.</p>
            <p>IN order to make their Complaint more formidable, they uſher in the Act paſſed in 1748, to ſhew what Sufferers they are like to be by the <hi>Virginia</hi> Acts of Aſſembly. In the ſhort Sketch that I have juſt now given of the Hiſtory of Exchange in this Colony, I ſhewed that it was always a Method in the Country, of paying Currency for Sterling <hi>ad valorem,</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:008476_0021_102f5a2a550b8708"/>
and that whilſt Creditors were govern'd by the real or exchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Difference ſubſiſting, it remained only an equitable Rule, neceſſarilly ſubſiſting in the Nature and Reaſon of Things; but when Avarice admitted of no Bounds to their Demands, the Aſſembly in 1748, took the Caſe under their Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and to do Juſtice to both Creditor and Debtor, made all Executions on Sterling Debts leviable at Twenty-five per Cent. which was then thought the common and reaſonable Exchange: But the Law was not long known in <hi>England,</hi> before the Merchants of <hi>London,</hi> whom I ſuppoſe I may ſafely call the Memorialiſts, endeavoured to obtain a Repeal of it, by the King's Proclamation; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they were given to underſtand it was conſtitutionally late, for a Repeal by Proclamation, as his Majeſty had given his Aſſent to the Act. And an Inſtruction was accordingly ſent to the Governor, to urge the Aſſembly (as thoſe Gentlemen term it) to do it by a ſubſequent Act. The Aſſembly always endeavouring to avoid giving the leaſt Color for a Complaint againſt them, then readily embraced the Opportunity, and with great Alacrity, paſſed a Law to Repeal that in 1748, and ſo enacted, that all Courts on any Judgment given in Sterling, ſhould at the Time of paſſing ſuch Judgment, ſettle at what Rate of Diſcount, the ſame ſhould be leviable in Current Money. Now let any candid Man ſay what theſe Memorialiſts would be at: A Clauſe is wanted in the Paper Act to provide for the Payment of Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>ad valorem,</hi> and it is ſo done and practiſed before and after the making of the Act. Again, the Act in 1748, is likely to injure them, when in Fact there is no ſuch Law in Being: Surely theſe Things can hardly be called common Miſtakes, no, they are groſs <hi>Blunders,</hi> begotten by a Genius for <hi>Clamoring.</hi> I now again hope this Act is not only cleared of all <hi>Arbitrarineſs</hi> and <hi>Injuſtice,</hi> but that it juſtly rides in Triumph over the Memorial, and all its deviliſh Machina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for certainly calumniating Inſinuations, and falſe Accuſations, are Satan's chief Implements.</p>
            <p>I WILL now conſider the Expedient propoſed by theſe Gentlemen, and that minutely too, to ſhew how little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of Regard this Body are in this Inſtance, however
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:008476_0022_102f5a044ca85758"/>
formidably they may have united; and indeed to ſhew how neceſſary it is to preſerve the Juſtice due to every Cauſe, by hearing both Parties fully before a Determination ſhould be given.</p>
            <p>TO ſeparate the Expedient from its great Bundle of Preamble, is ſimply to ſay, it is an Amendment to the Paper Act. 1ſt, To ſecure all Contracts before the paſſing the Act from any Effect at all by it. 2dly, That in all Caſes of Sterling Debts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſtipulated payable in Sterling either before or after the Act, ſuch Debts. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall not be effected by a Tender of Paper, or any other Species of Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency not being Sterling at any Rate, unleſs the Creditor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall conſent to it; and if he does conſent to it and takes the Money, that then he ſhall be deemed in Law, fully ſatisfy'd for his Debt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I CANNOT here paſs over a Compliment due to the Gentlemen, on Account of their Happineſs in the Choice of a Draftſman, who has diſcovered in the Memorial, a wonderful Dexterity in ſplitting Unities; that is, dividing one and the ſame Thing into ſeveral Parts, for the Sake of multiplying Sentences: The wiſer Part of Mankind has indeed condemned the Practice as non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſical, but a bad Cauſe (or rather no Cauſe at all) for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining, ſhould be rolled up in an abundant Diſguiſe of Words. The firſt Part of the Amendment propoſed is wholly to ſecure Debts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> made before the Act from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing affected by it. And what does the ſecond Part of the Amendment propoſe? Nothing more than to ſecure all Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Debts, made both before and after the Act, from being affected by it; for I conceive it wants no written Law to tell a Man if his Creditor is willing to diſcharge his Debt, for Carrots or Turnips, he may pay them to him; and that after he has paid them, and the Creditor has taken them as ſuch, he is certainly diſcharged from any further Claim on Account of that Debt or Contract; and for this he has the Law of common Senſe to direct him. But now for the Reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſuch an Amendment, which not only ſtrikes at the Paper Act, but at all Rules and Acts relative to the exchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:008476_0023_102f5a2d48d450a0"/>
of current Money, and of Courſe at the Law of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Juſtice, before explained; when I ſay the Reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſuch an Amendment, I mean not the Amendment as it is worded, for verily that is mere formal Nonſenſe, but of any Amendment to ſecure theſe Sterling Debts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from being paid by Law in the Currency of the Country <hi>ad va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorem,</hi> for that is the certain Drift of the Memorialiſts; a Drift they did not care to be plain in diſcovering, when they charged the Paper Act as being defective with Reſpect to Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Debts: In this Kind, indeed, it is defective; and had it been otherwiſe, it would have been the moſt fallacious Act imaginable, by emitting a Currency that ſhould be no where current, not ſo current as a Caſk of Nails, or any other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, to be ſold only to him that might want to buy them, for any Man might hold what he had to ſell at a Sterling De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and then of what Wotrh would the Paper Notes have been? I need ſay nothing more to ſuch an Amendment, than to remind any Reader of the Neceſſity that muſt have always ſubſiſted of exchanging (not only in <hi>Virginia,</hi> but in every Country where Sterling is not the ſole Currency) Sterling for ſuch Currency, at an agreed Rate; and that it was from this Neceſſity alone that any Law could ever have ariſen to eſtabliſh the Method of doing it, leſt the Will of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor ſhould grow too extravagant for the Capacity of the Debtor; all which, I flatter myſelf, I have fully ſhewn in my Obſervations already made on this Memorial. I ſhould now take Leave of the Expedient, but that there is a ſeeming Arrogancy in concluding that it was impoſſible for the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of <hi>Virginia</hi> to make any Objections to the Amendment, in ſo far as it is, <hi>bona fide,</hi> founded on Principles of <hi>common Juſtice,</hi> and the Laws of <hi>England.</hi> What, do the Principles of common Juſtice oblige a People, extending the Power of a Mother-Country, by improving her diſtant Territories, and in doing that, confined (except in ſome trifling Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities) ſolely to a Trade with that Mother-Country? I ſay, ſhould ſuch a People, in the Courſe of ſuch Trade, fall in Debt to ſuch Mother-Country, do the Principles of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Juſtice</hi> enjoin, that Perſons ſo circumſtanced ſhould not be allowed any Way of paying ſuch Debts, but in a Coin of which there is hardly an Hundred Pounds to be found
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:008476_0024_102f5a05d2e1f430"/>
amongſt them in a Year; or elſe to pay them according to the extravagant Demands that their Creditors ſhall make in the Currency they have: Gentlemen that talk ſo, muſt be Madmen; is this <hi>common Juſtice?</hi> It is, <hi>bona fide, unnatural, and againſt all Juſtice.</hi> Again, the Amendment (they ſay) is founded on the Laws of <hi>England</hi>; to this I anſwer, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out entering into a critical Enquiry as to the Fact, and with all poſſible Deference, that if there be ſuch a Law, as the Laws of no People on Earth ſhould be unalterable, every Moment that it has had any Effect in the Manner that theſe Memorialiſts propoſe, it muſt have been grievouſly partial and burthenſome; and therefore it ought now to change its Face, and ſmile on thoſe who have deſerved all Attention, and every reaſonable Indulgence; who, in Spite of Poverty and every unnatural Check, have certainly convinced the World, that they are faithful Subjects, endued with that Nobleneſs of Spirit that has ever diſtinguiſhed a true-born <hi>Briton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Concluſion is of a Piece with the whole Memorial, that runs on with a very great Air of Importance, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of <hi>nothing real</hi>; and this, it is evident, is as pompouſly inclined to the ſame Point, <hi>Nothing.</hi> There is a Requeſt made to their Lordſhips, that they would be pleaſed to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend giving Judgment on the <hi>Virginia</hi> Act as it now ſtands, by Way of Approbation thereof, till ſuch Time as the Senſe of the Aſſembly of the Province is had upon the Amendments propoſed thereto; which, in Fact, is deſiring that their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips would let the Act keep its Force and Efficacy, which every Act muſt neceſſarily do that is pſſed by the Governor, unleſs his Majeſty ſhall declare his Diſſent by Proclamation, which no Doubt he is in ſome Caſes adviſed to: But, if the Act lyes for his Majeſty's Pleaſure, it is neceſſarily operating here as a Law, unleſs provided againſt in the Body of it by a ſuſpending Clauſe. Their Lordſhips Approbation of an Act might indeed incline his Majeſty to give his Aſſent to it, and thereby give it a greater Degree of Firmneſs in the Conſtitution; but this can hardly be very neceſſary, in many temporary Laws: Of Courſe then theſe Gentlemen have really aſked for <hi>nothing,</hi> with Reſpect to their Complaint;
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:008476_0025_102f5a31574229a0"/>
not only <hi>nothing</hi> to their Purpoſe, but ſo long as their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt is granted; that is, that their Lordſhips ſhall be ſilent as to their Approbation of the Act. It is very mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially againſt them; but I have all along ſeen they have a latent Meaning in the Memorial, and I ſuſpect here they are praying that their Lordſhips will ſuſpend their Approbation, in order to offer up another Prayer hereafter, that they will be pleaſed to adviſe his Majeſty to repeal it; and this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction is not out of the Way of their partial Syſte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If I miſtake not, it would amount to an entire Forfeiture of <hi>publick Faith,</hi> with a very ſacred Abſolution for ſo doing.</p>
