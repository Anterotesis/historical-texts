            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>TO the primitive chriſtians, to thoſe who heard the words of CHRIST himſelf, or who obeyed the inſpired dictates of his immediate ſucceſſors, the text refers. They deſcribe the effects which neceſſarily ariſe from true and vital piety. Theſe effects are, an attachment to the peculiar and important doctrines of the goſpel, a ſpirit of conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion and benevolence to our fellow chriſtians and our fellow men, and a deep reverence for, as well as a punctual attendance upon, the ordinances of divine worſhip. Theſe are the genuine fruits of righteouſneſs, flowing ſpontaneouſly from a renewed and holy heart.</p>
            <p>IN every age of the chriſtian church, its real members have deſerved and received the character given in the text. The word, the will, the precepts of CHRIST have always been dear to them, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged their attention and obedience. Thoſe who
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:038619_0004_1012A87418E07820"/>
are truly conſcientious cannot be eaſy when ſacred truth is either denied or corrupted; neither will they be eaſy when they are "taught for doctrines the commandments of men," or are obliged to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to ceremonies which they do not conſider as authorized by the word of GOD.</p>
            <p>IT was this noble and chriſtian ſpirit which peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled with civilized and chriſtan inhabitants the wilds of New England. Our venerable anceſtors felt themſelves aggrieved in their native land. They were forbidden to practice the worſhip and diſcipline which they deemed ſcriptural and important, and were obliged under heavy penalties to conform to ſuch as they viewed in a different light. Now that the controverſy is mellowed by time, and mutual harmony has removed the roughneſs, which, for want of candor and more frequent communication, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to both parties, we are ready to wonder that ſo much keenneſs ſhould be diſcovered, and ſo great ſacrifices made to what we eſteem matters compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively indifferent.—But it is not poſſible for us to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the motives of men, and therefore we have no right to judge or condemn them. That the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of our churches were actuated by motives really conſcientious, we are certain: For, only to the claims, the ſtrong claims of conſcience, will men ſacrifice their native country and their domeſtic happineſs, by emigrating to a foreign and inhoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſhore. They loved GOD, and "went after him into the wilderneſs." Here they eſtabliſhed a civil polity, the ſpirit and energy of which remain to the preſent day. They eſtabliſhed literary and religious
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:038619_0005_1012A876F7BE2828"/>
inſtitutions, which have been the great ſources of the freedom and happineſs of our country. They foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded churches which, "having obtained help of GOD, continue unto this day."</p>
            <p>A GREAT degree of harmony prevailed in our Country, and between our Churches, for many years. It was ſometimes interrupted indeed by ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries who inſerted themſelves among us, and endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ored to eſtabliſh tenets of doctrine and diſcipline, which would have overthrown all civil government; ſpread anarchy and confuſion over the face of the new ſettlement, and would probably in the iſſue have defeated the deſigns of the original emigrants. The principles of ſelf defence led to meaſures, which under other circumſtances, might not have been juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifiable. The intruders were baniſhed from the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory, and ſome were more heavily puniſhed. Our fathers had purchaſed an aſylum for themſelves, an abode where they could hold their own ſentiments and practice their own modes. They ſuppoſed therefore that they had a right to enjoy this liberty in quiet. They ſuppoſed that thoſe who differed from them had no right to invade the wilderneſs they had ſubdued or to interrupt their tranquillity, but ought to find ſome other place where they might worſhip in peace in their own way without diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their neighbors.</p>
            <p>AMONG the Churches of New England, that which I now addreſs has always held an honorable place. One hundred years were, the laſt week, compleated, ſince the reſpectable founders of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution firſt aſſembled publicly for the worſhip of
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:038619_0006_1012A8788AB84B10"/>
GOD upon the very ſpot which we now cover. This circumſtance has led my thoughts to the ſubject be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, and induced me to attempt giving you a brief ſummary of the affairs of this Church from its firſt ſettlement to the preſent day, and to ſuggeſt to your minds and my own, ſuch reflections as may make us wiſer and better.</p>
            <p>A NUMBER of good men, diſtinguiſhed for their liberality of thinking, as well as for their regard to the goſpel and its ordinances, laid the foundation of this church. While they reſpected the religious practices of the day, they thought that in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects they might be improved. The country had then been ſettled ſeventy years, and in this period very little alteration had taken place in doctrine, diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline or manners. As to the doctrines of religion, theſe good men did not profeſſedly differ from their brethren of other churches. In a manifeſto, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed with a view to make known their purpoſes in the undertaking before them, they thus expreſs themſelves on this point, "We approve and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the confeſſion of faith put forth by the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of divines at Weſtminſter. We deſign only the true and pure worſhip of GOD according to the rules appearing plainly to us in his word."</p>
            <p>BUT in ſeveral reſpects they differed from other churches as to modes of order and diſcipline. In worſhip they differed from them as to reading the ſcriptures and the uſe of the LORD's prayer in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic. To the firſt of theſe practices it was objected, that the ſcriptures could not be underſtood fully without an expoſition, and that unlearned and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:038619_0007_1012A87B98F85580"/>
men would be apt to wreſt them to their own deſtruction. In reply to this, our founders juſtified their conduct by ſaying, that this objection would operate equally againſt reading the ſcriptures in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, becauſe they might be thus abuſed, and thus the practice of the church of Rome in withholding the ſcriptures from the people would be juſtified; that the word of GOD could not be injurious to thoſe who honored and obeyed it, and that many ought not to be deprived of a privilege becauſe a few might abuſe it; that we ſhould hear the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of GOD himſelf, and then exerciſe our own judgment (not that of any earthly teacher) in deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining its true meaning; and that it was doing honor to the ſcriptures to have them read (agreeably to the practice of the primitive church) in their pure unadulterated ſtate, during the public worſhip of GOD.</p>
            <p>THE ancient diſſenters did not approve the frequent uſe of the LORD's prayer in the liturgy of the church of England. They ſtiled this a vain repetition. Their ſeparation made them wiſh to keep as far as poſſible from the cuſtoms of the parent church, and they accordingly ſeldom or ever uſed this excellent form. The founders of this church avoided both extremes. They concluded to have this conciſe and comprehenſive prayer uſed once in each ſeaſon of public worſhip. The practice has been invariable to the preſent day.</p>
            <p>THE admiſſion to full communion was juſtly deemed, by the firſt ſettlers of this country, a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of great importance. The general opinion was, that none ſhould partake of this privilege but ſuch
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:038619_0008_1012A87E7818D318"/>
as were truly born of GOD. In order that the church might judge of this fact, a relation of his chriſtian experiences, either written or oral, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of every candidate for this privilege. This uſage had degenerated into a matter of mere form, and ſuch a ſimilarity prevailed in theſe inſtruments, as gave too much occaſion for ridicule. In this church therefore the practice was diſuſed. At leaſt it was not required, while every one was left at lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty to do it, which, however, has never in a ſingle inſtance been improved. They required that the paſtor or paſtors ſhould be ſatisfied as to the qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of thoſe who offered themſelves to baptiſm or the communion, and this ſatisfaction, properly expreſſed, they conſidered as a ſufficient reaſon for admiſſion, without a formal vote of the church.</p>
            <p>"We apprehend (ſays the manifeſto before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned) that a particular church, as ſuch, is a ſociety of chriſtians by mutual agreement uſually meeting together for public worſhip in the ſame place and under the ſame miniſtry, attending on the ordinances of GOD there. Under this principle we have never been in the habit of requiring or giving diſmiſſions from or to other churches. If any perſon ſtatedly congregates or communicates with us, we conſider him as a member of our church, and admit him to all chriſtian privileges. At the ſame time we view him as ſubject to chriſtian diſcipline from us in caſe of offence."—So liberal has the ſpirit of this church always been as that its arms have been opened to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive chriſtians of all proteſtant ſects and denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:038619_0009_1012A882AFB159C0"/>
and admit them to the ſame privileges as they enjoyed in their own communities.</p>
            <p>IN ancient days the choice of a miniſter (as well as the choice of all civil officers) was confined to thoſe who were in full communion with the church. In this reſpect alſo our original conſtitution differed from the general practice. "We cannot, ſays the manifeſto, confine the right of chooſing a miniſter to the communicants alone, but we think that every baptized adult perſon, who contributes to the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, ſhould have a vote in electing." This principle, founded in ſtrict juſtice and reaſon, has been invariably practiced upon ever ſince.</p>
            <p>So proper and neceſſary do theſe alterations ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to us, and ſo generally are they adopted at the preſent day, as that we wonder any perſon ſhould oppoſe them. But there were many men, ſome from a reverence to ancient inſtitutions, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of their propriety, ſome from dread of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and others from a fear that this new and popular ſociety would diminiſh their own ſocieties and leſſen the influence they held; who exclaimed loudly againſt this new eſtabliſhment. Reſpectable and opulent as were the men who formed it, they found it difficult for a time to ſtem the torrent of public opinion which ran ſtrongly againſt them, and overcome the jealouſy which their neighbors felt of being eclipſed by them.</p>
            <p>UNDER theſe circumſtances, it was neceſſary for them to chooſe a miniſter who agreed with them in ſentiment; who had a liberal mind, and who had firmneſs enough to ſupport his own opinions in the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:038619_0010_1012A884432DC438"/>
face of prejudice and paſſion. Such a one they found in Mr. BENJAMIN COLMAN, a young man born in their own town, educated at their own col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, but who, by a reſidence of four years in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, had overcome local prejudices; and was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to purſue a mode of church worſhip and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline ſimilar to that of the diſſenting churches in England; among whom he had been an uſeful and acceptable preacher.—From an apprehenſion that he might meet with difficulty in procuring an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation here, they requeſted him to aſk it of the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in London, who readily granted his deſire, and by prayer, with the laying on of the hands of the preſbytery, he was ſeparated to the work of the miniſtry, Auguſt 4, 1699.</p>
            <p>THE church continued to flouriſh under the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtry of this excellent man for many years. Not long after his ſettlement, a propoſition was made to join with him in the paſtoral office a Mr. ELIPHA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LET ADAMS. He preached to the ſociety under this idea for two years and an half. This propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did not ſucceed.</p>
            <p>THE commencement of our intimate connexion with the firſt church in this town was in the year 1711. In conſequence of the deſtruction of their meeting-houſe by fire, they aſſembled here for a year and an half, when their preſent edifice was compleated. This connexion was cemented by our being united in the lecture preparatory to the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The latter union took place in the month of March, 1720. The happineſs and edification of both ſocieties have been greatly promoted by this
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:038619_0011_1012A8877994B130"/>
meaſure. We have felt ourſelves to be in a ſenſe one. And when either of us have needed accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation, in conſequence of repairing or rebuilding our reſpective places of worſhip, we have always found it with each other.</p>
            <p>THE prejudices or rather taſte of the age may be found from obſerving the refuſal of the ſociety to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept an organ bequeathed them by THOMAS BRAT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TLE, Eſq. who was their principal benefactor,<note n="*" place="bottom">Since that period there have been many large donations made to the ſociety by its affluent and reſpectable members. It would be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to particularize all theſe. It is but juſtice however to remark, that the late Governor HANCOCK was the greateſt benefactor the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety ever had. He gave the bell and a pulpit made of mahogany, and curiouſly carved, beſides a very handſome ſubſcription in money, at the time of rebuilding the meeting-houſe. He preſented us alſo with an elegant folio bible to be read in public. He ſubſcribed very large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and more than any individual, towards the expenſe of purchaſing the preſent organ. The late Governor BOWDOIN alſo, with his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and connexions, have been great benefactors to the ſociety.</note> and in a ſenſe their founder. This took place in the year 1713, when they voted, "that they did not think proper to uſe the ſame in the public worſhip of GOD."</p>
            <p>Aug. 16, 1715, Mr. WILLIAM COOPER was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the paſtoral office in connexion with Dr. COL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAN. His youth and his modeſty led him to beg, that his actual ſeparation to the work of the miniſtry might be delayed as long as poſſible. With a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, which did Mr. COOPER ſo much honor, the church complied, and he was not ordained till May, 1716.</p>
            <p>WITH two paſtors diſtinguiſhed for their literary and miniſterial qualifications; both warmly engaged in the ſervice of their maſter, and united in their
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:038619_0012_1012A88C0264B390"/>
ſentiments, their exertions and their ardent zeal, the ſociety increaſed from year to year in numbers and reſpectability. Many "were added to the church of ſuch as, we truſt, are ſaved," and the candle of the LORD ſhone brightly on our tabernacle.</p>
            <p>No cloud intervened to diminiſh this brightneſs till the month of December, 1743, when Mr. COOP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ER was ſuddenly ſnatched from the arms of his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and flock, and tranſlated to a better world. Could the warmeſt affection, the higheſt eſteem, the moſt fervent prayers of his people poured out in ſecret, in the family and in the church of GOD, have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted his life, it would not have been taken away. But the will of GOD was done, and he fell in the midſt of his days and uſefulneſs.</p>
            <p>BUT this heavy loſs was compenſated by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of his ſon, the late excellent Dr. COOPER, in the ſacred deſk. In this place he commenced and terminated his miniſterial labors. His mild and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle manners, his delicate taſte, his brilliant talents for the ſervices and devotions of the pulpit, as well as their regard to the memory of his father, fixed the eyes of this people upon him. Within a very few weeks they called him to office. Having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the ſame modeſty and made the ſame delay as his father had done in ſimilar circumſtances, he was ordained on the twenty-firſt of May, 1746.</p>
            <p>THIS event was ſucceeded by one of a very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent nature. On Aug. 29, 1747, the venerable Dr. COLMAN died ſuddenly! This great and good man poſſeſſed a capacious mind, a ſtrong inclination for what is called belle lettre, as well as more ſerious
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:038619_0013_1012A88D914C0A20"/>
learning, a natural politeneſs, and an eaſy dignity of manners which commanded reſpect and conciliated eſteem. His foreign correſpondence was extenſive, and his influence was always exerted to ſerve our college and his country.</p>
            <p>No propoſal has ſince been made to have more than one paſtor at a time in the church. The late Dr. COOPER, by his exemplary life, his elegant diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, his fervent prayers, his patriotic ſervices, and his graceful manners, acquired a very high reputation at home and abroad.—No remarkable event took place during the courſe of his miniſtry, excepting an alteration in the verſion of the pſalms and the demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition of our ancient place of worſhip, with the erection of the preſent elegant and <note n="*" place="bottom">This building coſt ſix thouſand pounds ſterling.</note> coſtly edifice, in which public worſhip was firſt celebrated July 25, 1773.</p>
            <p>For thirty-ſeven years, in the courſe of which term our trying and diſtreſsful but glorious revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion began and was completed, Dr. COOPER contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the beloved, the uſeful and ſucceſsful paſtor of this church. But death, with inexorable hand, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted him in the zenith of his popularity and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, Dec. 29, 1783. Few men have lived more eſteemed, or died more lamented.</p>
            <p>ON Jan. 12, 1785, I received the paſtoral charge of this church. With the events which led to and ſucceeded this ſolemn tranſaction you are all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted. With truth I can ſay, that you have done all which affection could dictate or bounty beſtow, to render my life eaſy and reſpectable. That I have been ſo little uſeful to you and your children, has
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:038619_0014_1012A890779F3260"/>
been my conſtant burden. But may we yet ſee bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter days on this account; And may my life and my uſefulneſs terminate together!</p>
            <p>As an evidence of the change of public opinion, I obſerve that the grand and melodious organ, which now aſſiſts our plaſmody and devotions, was opened for the firſt time on the 17th day of June, 1792. That, which eighty years before was rejected when offered freely, was then procured at a great expenſe.</p>
            <p>IT has been the honor and felicity of this church that its union has never been interrupted. In all ſocieties there will of courſe be men who have an attachment to their own opinions. In this ſociety, the gentleneſs of manners, the candor, condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and brotherly love, which are the ornament and the band of religious aſſociations, have conciliated the affection and quieted the minds of thoſe who have thought differently from the majority. "No root of bitterneſs has ſprung up among us." The love of peace and harmony has ever prevailed, and we have a fair proſpect of continuing a happy ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</p>
            <p>AND now, my brethren, be thankful to GOD, who has ſo remarkably ſmiled upon your predeceſſors and yourſelves even to this day. "The vineyard which his own right hand planted," has flouriſhed and increaſed for one hundred years. No furious blaſt has overthrown it. No inſidious enemy has undermined or extirpated it. We behold it this day flouriſhing in its original beauty, and bringing forth, we truſt, the cluſters of Canaan," good fruit unto GOD. It is our hearts deſire and prayer to
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:038619_0015_1012A8920D610C80"/>
GOD, "that a pure and a ſpiritual church may be continued here ſo long as the ſun and the moon ſhall endure. When we ſhall be gathered to the duſt of our fathers, and the "places" which now know us ſhall know us no more, may a generation riſe up which ſhall love GOD more, and ſerve him better than ever <hi>we</hi> have done. May the members of this church be more exemplary, and its miniſters more uſeful, through all ſucceeding ages! May it flouriſh with the vigor of youth and the wiſdom of age, till the preſent diſpenſation ſhall be compleated, and the church univerſal ſhall be tranſlated from earth to heaven!</p>
            <p>LET us reflect with delight and reverence on the immutability of GOD! The men and the things of time paſs rapidly away, but he abideth "the ſame yeſterday, to day and forever!" Although we may not "put our truſt in princes nor in the ſons of men, for their breath goeth forth and they alſo are vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty," yet we may ſafely rely on the wiſdom and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ruler of the univerſe! To his Son, our Saviour, we may ſafely confide our immortal inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts; and in his univerſal government we may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways rejoice, for the judge of all the earth will do right!</p>
            <p>How ſwiftly, my brethren, does time paſs away! Another year, and a full century ſince the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our religious ſociety, have now elapſed! E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, the moſt important to our country and the world, have taken place in it! Some of us have wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed theſe ſcenes, and others have lived many years of this century! Let us all make a ſolemn pauſe, and inquire what is our ſtate and condition!
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:038619_0016_1012A897DA780BF8"/>
Have we improved our time and our talents, and what is the foundation of our hope towards GOD! We may never witneſs the cloſe of another year; and there is not the moſt diſtant probability, (I had almoſt ſaid poſſibility) that any one of us will ſee the end of another century! There is no hazard in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting that, before another hundred years revolve over this church, every one of us, of every age and deſcription, will be numbered with the dead, and gone to our account! Where ſhall we then be? In happineſs or miſery, in heaven or in hell? How ſhall we appear before the judgment ſeat of CHRIST, and what will be our ſentence at the laſt day? Theſe are ſolemn queſtions. They relate to our ſouls and eternity. They require ſerious examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and deliberate anſwers. Let us this day "think on our ways, and turn our feet unto GOD's teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. Let us make haſte, and not delay to keep his commandments."</p>
            <p>"OUR fathers, where are they, and the prophets, do they live forever?" The men, who once worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on this very ſpot, are "gone the way of all the earth," and their bones are now mouldering to duſt in the dark and ſilent grave! Soon ſhall we follow them, and have no more ſhare in any thing that is done under the ſun! May GOD prepare us for this ſolemn hour! May GOD enable us to "ſerve him and our generation according to his will! And may we ſo worſhip him in his courts below as that we may be prepared to ſerve him, with perfect puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and happineſs, in his temple above!</p>
