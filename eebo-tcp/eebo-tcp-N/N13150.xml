            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>OBSERVATIONS ON THE <hi>AMERICAN</hi> REVOLUTION.</head>
            <p>THE efforts of Great-Britain to reduce theſe United States being now almoſt brought to a period; it is proper that the citizens of America ſhould look over the ground they have trodden. This becomes neceſſary in order that the preſent generation may fully comprehend thoſe two points which poſterity indeed will perceive at a ſingle glance, but which it is of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to the conſciences of men to be well informed of now. For certainly it becomes us to know that the conteſt which hath emancipated our country, originated with our enemies, and hath been by them urged on for the purpoſes of domination: while on our part every ſtep hath been taken conſiſtent with poſſible ſafety to deprecate their vengeance and avert the calamities of war.</p>
            <p>FOR the better underſtanding this important ſubject, we muſt take a curſory view of the Britiſh colonies before the revolution, previous to which it may be neceſſary to make ſome few remarks on the circumſtance of coloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation. This tho' it introduced new incidents not to be met with in the antient hiſtories of human affairs, neither did or could introduce any new reaſon or new maxims of juſtice.</p>
            <p>THE great principle therefore is and ever will remain in force, that MEN ARE BY NATURE FREE. As ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to him that made them, they muſt be ſo; and ſo long as we have any idea of divine juſtice, we muſt aſſociate that of human freedom. Whether men can <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> with their liberty is among the queſtions which have
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:016625_0003_0F9D7027EB322AA0"/>
exerciſed the ableſt writers: but it is conceded on all hands, that the right to be free can never be alienated. Still leſs is it practicable for one generation to mortgage the privileges of another. The right of a ſtate over its own members hath alſo been brought into queſtion; and there are not wanting authorities to ſhew, that citizens who renounce allegiance and protection may fly from the territories of the ſtate, and erect new independent go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments in new countries. Be this as it may, the point is clear that when the conſent of government is obtained, the individuals are again in a ſtate of nature; alike free either to ſubmit to a ſociety exiſting or to eſtabliſh one, as their intereſt or their inclination may prompt. Here then is the ſituation of thoſe who wearied with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions and oppreſſions of the old world, boldly threw themſelves upon the protection of Providence to explore the new, and traverſed the ocean to inhabit a wilderneſs amid nations of barbarous foes. Theſe firſt adventurers, inſpired by freedom, ſupported by induſtry, and protected by Heaven, became inured to toil, to hardſhip, and to war. In ſpite therefore of every obſtacle they obtained a ſettlement; and then turned their attention to the ſecurity of thoſe equal rights for which they had encountered ſo many perils and inconveniencies. For this purpoſe they framed independent conſtitutions; and theſe however dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in form, were all inſpired by the ſame ſpirit, and all founded on that eternal maxim of free governments, that no man can be bound by laws to which he does not conſent. Theſe little republics ſoon began to flouriſh with a vigor and beauty adequate to the radical energy of their firſt principle. Of conſequence they became a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable object to that genius of enterprize which had animated the monarchies of Europe. On the other hand, their weakneſs required ſome antient trunk to ſupport them for a while in the ſtorm of ambition. Our anceſtors therefore, ſtimulated by their neceſſities, and ſeduced by ancient habits, and the remembrance of former friendſhips and connections, were eaſily prevailed on to ſubject them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the king of England, in conſequence of his ſolemn promiſe to afford them protection in common with all his other ſubjects againſt foreign force and internal violence. The Britiſh colonies then, under that name,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:016625_0004_0F9D7028BB63E350"/>
were in fact ſo many independent ſtates, whoſe only po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical connection with each other and with the ſeveral parts of the Britiſh empire, was by means of a common ſovereign. It followed from their natural and political ſituation that this connection could not be permanent, and indeed the fabric muſt have crumbled to pieces at a much earlier period if it had not been cemented by the ſameneſs of manners and language, a ſtriking ſimilarity of civil inſtitutions, a continued intercourſe for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of commerce and other circumſtances of the like kind. For the intereſts of Great-Britain and America were diametrically oppoſite, whether we conſider them either in a political or commercial view. It was for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance the intereſt of Great-Britain, that needy dependents there ſhould rebuild their ſhattered fortunes here, and the wealthy citizens of this country expend their property at the metropolis. That we ſhould be obliged to take part in all their wars whether for defence or conqueſt. That our trade ſhould be confined to their ports; and finally, that they ſhould have a power by laws paſſed in their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to bind us in all caſes whatſoever; and not only did the difference of intereſts work to this end, but nature had ſo widely ſeparated the two countries, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible they could long have been joined together upon terms even of deſpotiſm.</p>
            <p>FROM what hath already been ſaid it muſt appear, that as a free people we could not be bound by arbitrary edicts of the prince, that by ſtill ſtronger reaſons we could not be bound by the more arbitrary edicts of our fellow ſubjects; and of conſequence, that altho' the prince and our fellow ſubjects ſhould join againſt us whatever force they might acquire, they could acquire no right by the union. But it will appear alſo, that we had on every principle a right to become independent, particularly if the crown ſhould violate thoſe contracts which formed the baſis of an union. For let us ſuppoſe that when our ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors quitted Europe, they went on the general principle of diſclaiming allegiance to and protection from the ſeveral ſtates of which they were ſubjects, or that they came hither with the permiſſion of thoſe ſtates, and even under a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract with the king of England. And when they arrived
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:016625_0005_0F9D70296ABDBA08"/>
here, let us ſuppoſe either that they eſtabliſhed independent governments which afterwards became ſubject by agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or that a conditional ſubjection was interwoven in their frame;—ſtill the exiſtence of the contract remains unimpeached; or even on a ſuppoſition that they had actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally bargained for unconditional ſubmiſſion, ſtill that bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain would have been from its very nature void as to them; or if not to them, at leaſt to their offſpring; and of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence from the principle of all free ſocieties, the contract will ſtill reſult. And it being evident that the two coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries not only had not, but really could not have (on free principles) any political connection but thro' the prince—ſo that right exerciſed in the revolution of England de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated ſince, and generally admitted, muſt neceſſarily draw with it the right to independence, which is above ſtated.</p>
            <p>PREVIOUS to the laſt war a few acts were paſſed in England infringing on the liberties of America; and but a few for the two following reaſons, 1ſt. Becauſe Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica was at that time an object of very little national attention. 2dly. Becauſe the poſſeſſions of the French enabled them to give ſuch effectual aid in caſe of rupture, that it was imprudent to tempt us too far. Theſe acts however were obeyed, becauſe the reſtraints were of no great conſequence; and becauſe we were too ſenſible of our weakneſs to be fully ſenſible of our rights, or at leaſt to vindicate them. But during the courſe of the war, the weight and magnitude of America became viſible; and at the peace, this great object was (or at leaſt ſeemed to be) inſeparably annexed to the crown of Britain. On the other hand, we had felt our own force, and were relieved from a neighbour whoſe views at that time cramped our growth and repreſſed our efforts. The conſequence of this change was inſtantly perceived. Great-Britain claimed revenue and dominion. We refuſed the one, and diſputed the other.</p>
            <p>THE hiſtory which Congreſs gave in their addreſs to America of October 1774, will on this occaſion deſerve our ſerious attention. It is as follows: "Soon after the concluſion of the late war, there commenced a memorable
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:016625_0006_0F9D702A32A6EF28"/>
change in the treatment of theſe colonies. By a ſtatute made in the fourth year of the preſent reign, a time of <hi>profound peace,</hi> alleging "the expediency of new provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and regulations for extending the commerce between <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and his majeſty's dominions in <hi>America,</hi> and the <hi>neceſſity of raiſing a revenue</hi> in the ſaid dominions for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraying the expences of <hi>defending,</hi> protecting, and ſecuring the ſame," the <hi>commons of Great-Britain</hi> undertook to <hi>give</hi> and <hi>grant</hi> to his majeſty many rates and duties, to be paid in theſe colonies. To enforce the obſervance of this act, it preſcribes a great number of ſevere penalties and forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and in two ſections makes a remarkable diſtinction between the ſubjects in <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and thoſe in <hi>America.</hi> By the one the penalties and forfeitures incurred there are to be recovered in any of the king's courts of record at Weſtminſter, or in the court of exchequer in Scotland; and by the other, the penalties and forfeitures incurred here are to be recovered in any court of record, or in any court of admiralty, or vice admiralty, at the election of the informer or proſecutor.</p>
            <p>THE inhabitants of theſe colonies, confiding in the juſtice of Great-Britain, were ſcarcely allowed ſufficient time to receive and conſider this act before another, well known by the name of the ſtamp act, and paſſed in the fifth year of this reign, engroſſed their whole attention. By this ſtatute the Britiſh parliament exerciſed in the moſt explicit manner a power of taxing us, and extending the juriſdiction of courts of admiralty and vice admiralty in the colonies to matters ariſing within the body of a county, and directed the numerous penalties and forfeitures thereby inflicted to be recovered in the ſaid courts.</p>
            <p>IN the ſame year a tax was impoſed upon us by an act eſtabliſhing ſeveral new fees in the cuſtoms. In the next year the ſtamp act was repealed; not becauſe it was founded in an erroneous principle, but as the repealing act recites, becauſe the <q>continuance thereof would be attended with many inconveniencies, and might be productive of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences greatly detrimental to the commercial intereſt of Great-Britain.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:016625_0007_0F9D702AE9D044F8"/>IN the ſame year and by a ſubſequent act it was declared, <q>that his majeſty in parliament of right had power to bind the people of theſe colonies by ſtatutes in all caſes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</q>
            </p>
            <p>IN the ſame year another act was paſſed, for impoſing rates and duties payable in theſe colonies. In this ſtatute the commons avoiding the terms of giving and granting, <q>humbly beſought his majeſty that it might be enacted, &amp;c.</q> But from a declaration in the preamble, that the rates and duties were "in lieu of" ſeveral others granted by the ſtatute firſt before mentioned for raiſing a revenue, and from ſome other expreſſions it appears that theſe duties were intended for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>IN the next year, [1767] an act was made <q>to enable his majeſty to put the cuſtoms and other duties in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica under the management of commiſſioners, &amp;c.</q> And the king thereupon erected the preſent expenſive board of commiſſioners, for the expreſs purpoſe of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying into execution the ſeveral acts relating to the revenue and trade in America.</p>
            <p>AFTER the repeal of the ſtamp act, having again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned ourſelves to our ancient unſuſpicious affections for the parent ſtate, and anxious to avoid any controverſy with her, in hopes of a favourable alteration in ſentiments and meaſures towards us, we did not preſs our objections againſt the above mentioned ſtatutes made ſubſequent to that repeal.</p>
            <p>ADMINISTRATION, attributing to trifling cauſes a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct that really proceeded from generous motives, were encouraged in the ſame year [1767] to make a bolder experiment on the patience of America.</p>
            <p>BY a ſtatute commonly called the glaſs, paper and tea act, made fifteen months after the repeal of the ſtamp act, the commons of Great-Britain reſumed their former language, and again undertook to <q>give and grant rates and duties to be paid in theſe colonies,</q> for the expreſs purpoſe of <q>raiſing a revenue to defray the charges of the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of juſtice, the ſupport of civil government, and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:016625_0008_0F9D702BAAD3F188"/>
defending the king's dominions</q> on this continent. The penalties and forfeitures incurred under this ſtatute, are to be recovered in the ſame manner with thoſe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the foregoing acts.</p>
            <p>TO this ſtatute ſo naturally tending to diſturb the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity then univerſal throughout the colonies, parliament in the ſame ſeſſion added another no leſs extraordinary.</p>
            <p>EVER ſince the making the preſent peace, a ſtanding army has been kept in theſe colonies: from reſpect for the mother country the innovation was not only tolerated, but the provincial legiſlatures generally made proviſion for ſupplying the troops.</p>
            <p>THE aſſembly of the province of New-York, having paſſed an act of this kind, but differing in ſome articles from the directions of the act of parliament made in the fifth year of this reign, the houſe of repreſentatives in that colony was prohibited by a ſtatute made in the laſt ſeſſion mentioned, from making any bill, order, reſolution, or vote, except for adjourning or chuſing a ſpeaker, until proviſion ſhould be made by the ſaid aſſembly for furniſhing the troops within that province not only with all ſuch ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries as were required by the ſtatute which they were charged with diſobeying, but alſo with thoſe required by two other ſubſequent ſtatutes, which were declared to be in force until the twenty-fourth day of March, 1769.</p>
            <p>THESE ſtatutes of the year 1767, revived the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions and diſcontents that had entirely ſubſided on the repeal of the ſtamp act; and amidſt the juſt fears and jealouſies thereby occaſioned, a ſtatute was made in the next year [1768] to eſtabliſh courts of admiralty and vice admiralty on a new model, expreſsly for the end of more effectually recovering of the penalties and forfeitures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by acts of parliament, framed for the purpoſe of raiſing a revenue in America, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>THE immediate tendency of theſe ſtatutes is, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the right of having a ſhare in legiſlation, by rendering aſſemblies uſeleſs; the right of property, by taking the money of the coloniſts without their conſent; the right of
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:016625_0009_0F9D702C6B289D50"/>
trial by jury, by ſubſtituting in their place trials in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty and vice admiralty courts, where ſingle judges preſide, holding their commiſſions during pleaſure; and unduly to influence the courts of common law, by ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the judges thereof totally dependent on the crown for their ſalaries.</p>
            <p>THESE ſtatutes, not to mention many others exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly exceptionable, compared one with another, will be found not only to form a regular ſyſtem, in which every part has great force, but alſo a pertinacious adherence to that ſyſtem for ſubjugating theſe colonies, that are not, and from local circumſtances cannot be repreſented in the houſe of commons, to the uncontroulable and unlimited power of parliament, in violation of their undoubted rights and liberties—in contempt of their humble and repeated ſupplications.</p>
            <p>SEVERE as the acts of parliament before mentioned are, yet the conduct of adminiſtration hath been equally injurious, and irritating to this devoted country.</p>
            <p>UNDER pretence of governing them, ſo many new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions uniformly rigid and dangerous have been intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, as could only be expected from incenſed maſters, for collecting the tribute or rather the plunder of conquered provinces.</p>
            <p>BY an order of the king, the authority of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in chief, and under him of the brigadier generals, in time of peace, is rendered ſupreme in all the civil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments in America; and thus an uncontroulable mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary power is veſted in officers not known to the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of theſe colonies.</p>
            <p>A LARGE body of troops, and a conſiderable armament of ſhips of war, have been ſent to aſſiſt in taking their money without their conſent.</p>
            <p>EXPENSIVE and oppreſſive offices have been multiplied, and the acts of corruption induſtriouſly practiſed to divide and deſtroy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:016625_0010_0F9D702D2954F690"/>THE judges of the admiralty and vice admiralty courts are impowered to receive their ſalaries and fees from the effects to be condemned by themſelves.</p>
            <p>THE commiſſioners of the cuſtoms are impowered to break open and enter houſes without the authority of any civil magiſtrate founded on legal information.</p>
            <p>JUDGES of courts of common law have been made en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely dependent on the crown for their commiſſions and ſalaries.</p>
            <p>A COURT has been eſtabliſhed at Rhode-Iſland, for the purpoſe of taking coloniſts to England to be tried.</p>
            <p>HUMBLE and reaſonable petitions from the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the people, have been frequently treated with contempt: and aſſemblies have been repeatedly and arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily diſſolved.</p>
            <p>FROM ſome few inſtances it will ſufficiently appear, on what pretences of juſtice thoſe diſſolutions have been founded.</p>
            <p>THE tranquillity of the colonies having been again diſturbed, as has been mentioned, by the ſtatutes of the year 1767, the earl of Hillſborough, ſecretary of ſtate, in a letter to governor Bernard, dated April 22, 1768, cenſures the "preſumption" of the houſe of repreſentatives for <q>reſolving upon a meaſure of ſo inflammatory a nature, as that of writing to the other colonies, on the ſubject of their intended repreſentations againſt ſome late acts of parliament;</q> then declares, that <q>his majeſty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders this ſtep as evidently tending to create unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable combinations, to excite an unjuſtifiable oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the conſtitutional authority of parliament;</q> and afterwards adds, <q>it is the king's pleaſure, that as ſoon as the general court is again aſſembled, at the time preſcribed by the charter, you ſhould require of the houſe of repreſentatives, in his majeſty's name, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcind the reſolution which gave birth to the circular
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:016625_0011_0F9D702DEBBC78E0"/>
letter from the ſpeaker, and to declare their diſappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of and diſſent to that raſh and haſty proceeding.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>IF the new aſſembly ſhould refuſe to comply with his majeſty's reaſonable expectation, it is the king's plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that you ſhould immediately diſſolve them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THIS letter being laid before the houſe, and the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution not being reſcinded according to order, the aſſembly was diſſolved. A letter of a ſimilar nature was ſent to other governors, to procure reſolutions, approving the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the repreſentatives of Maſſachuſetts-Bay, to be reſcinded alſo; and the houſes of repreſentatives in other colonies refuſing to comply, their aſſemblies were diſſolved.</p>
            <p>THESE mandates ſpoke a language to which the ears of Engliſh ſubjects had for ſeveral generations been ſtrangers. The nature of aſſemblies implies a power and right of deliberation; but theſe commands, proſcribing the exerciſe of judgment on the propriety of the requiſitions made, left to the aſſemblies only the election between dictated ſubmiſſion, and threatened puniſhment: a puniſhment too founded on no other act than ſuch as is deemed innocent even in ſlaves—of agreeing in petitions for redreſs of grievances that equally affect all.</p>
            <p>THE hoſtile and unjuſtifiable invaſion of the town of Boſton ſoon followed theſe events in the ſame year; though that town, the province in which it is ſituated, and all the colonies from abhorrence of a conteſt with their parent ſtate, permitted the execution even of thoſe ſtatutes againſt which they ſo unanimouſly were complaining, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrating and ſupplicating.</p>
            <p>ADMINISTRATION, determined to ſubdue a ſpirit of freedom which Engliſh miniſters ſhould have rejoiced to cheriſh, entered into a monopolizing combination with the Eaſt-India company, to ſend to this continent vaſt quantities of tea, an article on which a duty was laid by a ſtatute that in a particular manner attacked the liberties of America, and which therefore the inhabitants of theſe colonies had reſolved not to import. The cargo ſent to
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:016625_0012_0F9D702EAAC109B0"/>
South-Carolina was ſtored, and not allowed to be ſold. Thoſe ſent to Philadelphia and New-York were not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to be landed. That ſent to Boſton was deſtroyed, becauſe governor Hutchinſon would not ſuffer it to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned.</p>
            <p>ON the intelligence of theſe tranſactions arriving in Great-Britain, the public ſpirited town laſt mentioned was ſingled out for deſtruction, and it was determined the province it belongs to ſhould partake of its fate. In the laſt ſeſſion of parliament therefore were paſſed the acts for ſhutting up the ports of Boſton, indemnifying the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers of the inhabitants of Maſſachuſetts-Bay, and chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their chartered conſtitution of government. To en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force theſe acts, that province is again invaded by a fleet and army.</p>
            <p>TO mention theſe outrageous proceedings, is ſufficient to explain them. For though it is pretended that the province of Maſſachuſetts-Bay has been particularly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpectful to Great-Britain, yet in truth the behaviour of the people in other colonies, has been an equal <q>oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the power aſſumed by parliament.</q> No ſtep however has been taken againſt any of the reſt. This artful conduct conceals ſeveral deſigns. It is expected that the province of Maſſachuſetts Bay will be irritated into ſome violent action that may diſpleaſe the reſt of the continent, or that may induce the people of Great-Britain to approve the meditated vengeance of an imprudent and exaſperated miniſtry. If the unexampled pacific temper of that province ſhall diſappoint this part of the plan, it is hoped the other colonies will be ſo far intimidated as to deſert their brethren, ſuffering in a common cauſe, and that thus diſunited, all may be ſubdued.</p>
            <p>TO promote theſe deſigns, another meaſure has been purſued. In the ſeſſion of parliament laſt mentioned, an act was paſſed for changing the government of Quebec, by which act the Roman catholic religion, inſtead of being tolerated, as ſtipulated by the treaty of peace, is eſtabliſhed; and the people there are deprived of a right to an aſſembly, trials by jury, and the Engliſh laws in civil caſes are
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:016625_0013_0F9D702F8CF68AE0"/>
aboliſhed, and inſtead thereof the French laws are eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, in direct violation of his majeſty's promiſe by his royal proclamation, under the faith of which many Engliſh ſubjects ſettled in that province; and the limits of that province are extended ſo as to comprehend thoſe vaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions that lie adjoining to the northerly and weſterly boundaries of theſe colonies.</p>
            <p>THE authors of this arbitrary arrangement flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that the inhabitants deprived of liberty, and art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully provoked againſt thoſe of another religion, will be proper inſtruments for aſſiſting in the oppreſſion of ſuch as differ from them in the modes of government and faith.</p>
            <p>FROM the detail of facts herein before recited, as well as from authentic intelligence received, it is clear beyond a doubt, that a reſolution is formed and now carrying into execution, to extinguiſh the freedom of theſe colonies by ſubjecting them to a deſpotic government.</p>
            <p>FOR the redreſs of theſe grievances, the Congreſs of America, inſtead of flying to arms, which, however juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable, would not perhaps have been wiſe, and which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ought as much as poſſible to be avoided, preſented a petition to the king, which after taking notice of the ſeveral executive and legiſlative acts before mentioned, proceeds thus.—"To a ſovereign who glories in the name of Briton, the bare recital of theſe acts muſt, we preſume, juſtify the loyal ſubjects who fly to the foot of his throne, and implore his clemency for protection againſt them.</p>
            <p>FROM this deſtructive ſyſtem of colony adminiſtration, adopted ſince the concluſion of the laſt war, have flowed thoſe diſtreſſes, dangers, fears and jealouſies that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm your majeſty's dutiful coloniſts with affliction: and we defy our moſt ſubtle and inveterate enemies to trace the unhappy differences between Great-Britain and theſe colonies, from an earlier period, or from other cauſes, than we have aſſigned. Had they proceeded on our own part from a reſtleſs levity of temper, unjuſt impulſes of ambition, or artful ſuggeſtions of ſeditious perſons, we
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:016625_0014_0F9D70315122D358"/>
ſhould merit the opprobrious terms frequently beſtowed upon us by thoſe we revere. But ſo far from promoting innovations, we have only oppoſed them; and can be charged with no offence unleſs it be one to receive injuries and be ſenſible of them.</p>
            <p>HAD our creator been pleaſed to give us exiſtence in a land of ſlavery, the ſenſe of our condition might have been mitigated by ignorance and habit. But, thanks be to his adorable goodneſs, we were born the heirs of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and ever enjoyed our right under the auſpices of your royal anceſtors, whoſe family was ſeated on the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh throne to reſcue and ſecure a pious and gallant nation from the deſpotiſm of a ſuperſtitious and inexorable tyrant. Your majeſty, we are confident, juſtly rejoices that your title to the crown is thus founded on the title of your people to liberty; and therefore, we doubt not but your royal wiſdom muſt approve the ſenſibility that teaches your ſubjects anxiouſly to guard the bleſſing they received from Divine Providence, and thereby to prove the performance of that compact which elevated the illuſtrious houſe of Brunſwick to the imperial dignity it now poſſeſſes.</p>
            <p>THE apprehenſion of being degraded into a ſtate of ſervitude from the pre-eminent rank of Engliſh freemen, while our minds retain the ſtrongeſt love of liberty and clearly foreſee the miſeries preparing for us and our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, excites emotions in our breaſts, which though we cannot deſcribe, we ſhould not wiſh to conceal. Feeling as men, and thinking as ſubjects in the manner we do, ſilence would be diſloyalty. By giving this faithful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, we do all in our power to promote the great objects of your royal cares, the tranquillity of your go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and the welfare of your people.</p>
            <p>DUTY to your majeſty, and regard for the preſervation of ourſelves and our poſterity, the primary obligations of nature and ſociety, command us to entreat your royal at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; and as your majeſty enjoys the ſignal diſtinction of reigning over freemen, we apprehend the language of freemen cannot be diſpleaſing. Your royal indignation, we hope, will rather fall on thoſe deſigning and dangerous
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:016625_0015_0F9D7031AC7F1D00"/>
men who daringly interpoſing themſelves between your royal perſon and your faithful ſubjects, and for ſeveral years paſt inceſſantly employed to diſſolve the bonds of ſociety, by abuſing your majeſty's authority, miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting your American ſubjects, and proſecuting the moſt deſperate and irritating projects of oppreſſion, have at length compelled us by the force of accumulated injuries, too ſevere to be any longer tolerable, to diſturb your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's repoſe by our complaints.</p>
            <p>THESE ſentiments are extorted from hearts that much more willingly would bleed in your majeſty's ſervice. Yet ſo greatly have we been miſrepreſented, that a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity has been alleged of taking our property from us without our conſent, "to defray the charge of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of juſtice, the ſupport of civil government, and the defence, protection, and ſecurity of the colonies." But we beg leave to aſſure your majeſty, that ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion has been and will be made for defraying the two firſt articles as has been and ſhall be judged by the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the ſeveral colonies juſt and ſuitable to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective circumſtances: and for the defence, protection, and ſecurity of the colonies, their militias if properly regulated, as they earneſtly deſire may immediately be done, would be fully ſufficient at leaſt in times of peace; and in caſe of war, your faithful coloniſts will be ready and willing, as they ever have been when conſtitutionally required, to demonſtrate their loyalty to your majeſty, by exerting their moſt ſtrenuous efforts in granting ſupplies and raiſing forces.</p>
            <p>YIELDING to no Britiſh ſubjects in affectionate at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to your majeſty's perſon, family, and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we too dearly prize the privilege of expreſſing that attachment by thoſe proofs that are honourable to the prince who receives them, and to the people who give them, ever to reſign it to any body of men upon earth. Had we been permitted to enjoy in quiet the inheritance left us by our forefathers, we ſhould at this time have been peaceably, cheerfully, and uſefully employed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending ourſelves by every teſtimony of devotion to your majeſty, and of veneration to the ſtate from which
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:016625_0016_0F9D703273190248"/>
we derive our origin. But though now expoſed to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected and unnatural ſcenes of diſtreſs by a contention with that nation in whoſe parental guidance on all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant affairs we have hitherto, with filial reverence, conſtantly truſted, and therefore can derive no inſtruction in our preſent unhappy and perplexing circumſtances from any former experience; yet, we doubt not, the purity of our intentions and the integrity of our conduct will juſtify us at that grand tribunal before which all mankind muſt ſubmit to judgment.</p>
            <p>WE aſk but for peace, liberty, and ſafety. We wiſh not a diminution of the prerogative, nor do we ſolicit the grant of any new right in our favour. Your royal authority over us and our connexion with Great-Britain, we ſhall always carefully and zealouſly endeavour to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and maintain.</p>
            <p>FILLED with ſentiments of duty to your majeſty and of affection to our parent ſtate, deeply impreſſed by our education, and ſtrongly confirmed by our reaſon, and anxious to evince the ſincerity of theſe diſpoſitions, we preſent this petition only to obtain redreſs of grievances, and relief from fears and jealouſies occaſioned by the ſyſtem of ſtatutes and regulations adopted ſince the cloſe of the laſt war for raiſing a revenue in America—extending the powers of courts of admiralty and vice admiralty—trying perſons in Great-Britain for offences alleged to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in America—affecting the province of Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts-Bay—and altering the government and extending the limits of Quebec: by the abolition of which ſyſtem, the harmony between Great-Britain and theſe colonies, ſo neceſſary to the happineſs of both, and ſo ardently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired by the latter, and the uſual intercourſes will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately reſtored. In the magnanimity and juſtice of your majeſty and parliament we confide for a redreſs of our other grievances, truſting, that when the cauſes of our apprehenſions are removed, our future conduct will prove us not unworthy of the regard we have been accuſtomed, in our happier days, to enjoy. For appealing to that Being who ſearches thoroughly the hearts of his creatures, we ſolemnly proſeſs that our councils have been influenced
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:016625_0017_0F9D703329C08D88"/>
by no other motive than a dread of impending de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
            <p>PERMIT us then, moſt gracious ſovereign, in the name of all your faithful people in America, with the utmoſt humility, to implore you for the honour of Almighty God, whoſe pure religion our enemies are undermining; for your glory which can be advanced only by rendering your ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects happy and keeping them united; for the intereſts of your family depending on an adherence to the principles that enthroned it; for the ſafety and welfare of your kingdoms and dominions threatened with almoſt una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable dangers and diſtreſſes, that your majeſty, as the loving father of your whole people, connected by the ſame bonds of law, loyalty, faith, and blood, though dwelling in various countries, will not ſuffer the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent relation formed by theſe ties to be farther violated in uncertain expectation of effects, which if attained, never can compenſate for the calamities through which they muſt be gained.</p>
            <p>WE therefore moſt earneſtly beſeech your majeſty, that your royal authority and interpoſition may be uſed for our relief, and that a gracious anſwer may be given to this petition.</p>
            <p>THAT your majeſty may enjoy every felicity through a long and glorious reign over loyal and happy ſubjects, and that your deſcendents may inherit your proſperity and dominions till time ſhall be no more, is, and always will be our ſincere and fervent prayer."</p>
            <p>BUT as the king of England was not our only op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent, but as it were the ally of our fellow ſubjects who had taken upon themſelves to claim dominion over us,—and as it is a melancholy truth that to make men reaſon, they muſt be made to feel,—ſo the Congreſs to induce the people of Great-Britain to recede from their extravagant demands, did, for themſelves and their conſtituents, agree and aſſociate as follows, to wit;</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:016625_0018_0F9D7033EDAB3920"/>"FIRST, That from and after the firſt day of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> next, we will not import into <hi>Britiſh America,</hi> from <hi>Great-Britain</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> any goods, wares or merchandize whatſoever, or from any other place, any ſuch goods, wares, or merchandize, as ſhall have been exported from <hi>Great-Britain</hi> or <hi>Ireland;</hi> nor will we after that day im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port any <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> tea from any part of the world; nor any molaſſes, ſyrups, paneles, coffee, or pimento, from the <hi>Britiſh</hi> plantations or from <hi>Dominica;</hi> nor wines from <hi>Madeira,</hi> or the weſtern iſlands; nor foreign indigo.</p>
            <p>"SECONDLY, We will neither import nor purchaſe any ſlave imported after the firſt day of December next; after which time we will wholly diſcontinue the ſlave trade, and will neither be concerned in it ourſelves, nor will we hire our veſſels, nor ſell our commodities or manufactures to thoſe who are concerned in it.</p>
            <p>"THIRDLY, As a non-conſumption agreement ſtrictly adhered to, will be an effectual ſecurity for the obſervation of the non-importation, we, as above, ſolemnly agree and aſſociate, that from this day we will not purchaſe or uſe any tea imported on account of the <hi>Eaſt-India company,</hi> or any on which a duty hath been or ſhall be paid; and from and after the firſt day of March next, we will not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe or uſe any <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> tea whatever; nor will we, nor ſhall any perſon for or under us, purchaſe or uſe any of thoſe goods, wares or merchandize, we have agreed not to import, which we ſhall know or have cauſe to ſuſpect were imported after the firſt day of <hi>December,</hi> except ſuch as come under the rules and directions of the tenth article hereafter mentioned.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:016625_0019_0F9D7034ABD0EB40"/>AND to inforce and explain the reaſons of this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, they publiſhed an addreſs to the people of Great-Britain. Whoever ſhall read the hiſtory of theſe tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions in a future age, will perhaps be aſtoniſhed that after the deſign of our enemies was thus clearly manifeſted, no other meaſures were taken to counteract them. To ſuppoſe that they would give up the plan ſo regularly formed and ſo deliberately undertaken, without the moſt cogent neceſſity, was certainly abſurd. War therefore ſhould have been conſidered as inevitable, and every pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion made for it by large importations of cloathing and military ſtores, as well as by negotiations with the rivals of Great-Britain.</p>
            <p>THESE things however were not only neglected, but the direct contrary road was purſued; ſo that the war really found us in a ſituation far more naked and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided than was natural to us. In anſwer to this however it is to be obſerved again, that mankind reaſon from their feelings. That we were really attached to Great-Britain, and ſought only to be united to her, if it were poſſible to be ſo, without the total proſtration of all our rights. This attachment in fact blinded us to our intereſts ſo effectually, that a preparation for war, or a threat of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence, would have created the moſt violent ferment. Congreſs (whatever may have been their private ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) were then, as at preſent, under a neceſſity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming to the popular opinion. Great reliance was placed upon the clemency of the prince, the juſtice of the people, and the commercial intereſts of the empire. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all this, war with Great-Britain was a moſt ſerious object. It would have been ſuch to any power on earth. Succeſs was at leaſt highly doubtful. The conſequence of victory on their part muſt have been on ours a total ſubjection. However clear might be the right of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance in caſes of abſolute neceſſity, it ſeemed to be highly proper, that this neceſſity ſhould clearly appear before the previous ſteps to reſiſtance were taken. On the whole, it was perhaps hardly juſtifiable to appeal to arms while the remoteſt probability remained of obtaining without them the great object of peace, liberty and ſafety.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:016625_0020_0F9D70356A0CA9E8"/>IT was in conformity to theſe ſentiments, that on the 11th of October, 1774, the Congreſs wrote a letter to general Gage, intreating him to forbear meaſures tending to irritate the people of Maſſachuſetts-Bay, and at the ſame time, "reſolved unanimouſly, that they be adviſed ſtill to conduct themſelves peaceably towards his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency general Gage, and his majeſty's troops now ſtationed in the town of Boſton, as far as can poſſibly be conſiſtent with their immediate ſafety, and the ſecurity of the town; avoiding and diſcountenancing every violation of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's property, or any inſult to his troops; and that they peaceably and firmly perſevere in the line they are now conducting themſelves on the defenſive."</p>
            <p>THIS Congreſs having given it as their opinion, that another ſhould meet on the tenth of May then next, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved itſelf on the 26th of October.</p>
            <p>IT appears that while they were thus ſolicitous for peace, our enemies had taken their determinations unalterably; for though the letter of lord Dartmouth to general Gage does not appear, the anſwer of the general of the 15th December, 1774, contains the fulleſt conviction. He ſays,—"Your lordſhip's idea of diſarming certain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces would doubtleſs be conſiſtent with prudence and ſafety; but it neither is, nor has been practicable, without having recourſe to force, and being maſters of the country."</p>
            <p>THEIR conſequent conduct appears fully conſonant with this general plan; for the petition to the king received no other notice than to be thrown on the table of parliament among the maſs of American papers, by which his intention to take part with our fellow ſubjects againſt us was fully declared. His miniſters avowed the determination to compel us to obey the acts they had paſſed; and a very conſiderable force was ſent out for that purpoſe. In the month of February, a reſolution was agreed to on a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one of the miniſters, which was at that time called a conciliatory motion; and which (allowing us to poſſeſs common ſenſe and common ſpirit) was directly the reverſe. This will appear from the motion itſelf, and from the ſenſe of the ſecond Congreſs upon it.—"The houſe in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:016625_0021_0F9D703629F4AD48"/>
on the American papers, motion made, and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion propoſed,</p>
            <p>"THAT it is the opinion of this committee, that when the general council and aſſembly, or general court of any of his majeſty's provinces or colonies in <hi>America,</hi> ſhall propoſe to make proviſion according to the condition, circumſtance, or ſituation of ſuch province or colony, for contributing their proportion to the common defence (ſuch proportion to be raiſed under the authority of the general court, or general aſſembly of ſuch province or colony, and diſpoſable by parliament) and ſhall engage to make proviſion alſo for the ſupport of the civil government, and the adminiſtration of juſtice in ſuch province or colony, it will be proper, if ſuch propoſal ſhall be approved by his majeſty and the two houſes of parliament, and for ſo long as ſuch proviſion ſhall be made accordingly, to forbear in reſpect of ſuch province or colony, to lay any duty, tax, or aſſeſſment, except only ſuch duties as it may be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to continue to levy or impoſe for the regulation of commerce; the net produce of the duties laſt mentioned to be carried to the account of ſuch province or colony reſpectively."</p>
            <p>THE Congreſs took the ſaid reſolution into conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and are thereupon of opinion,</p>
            <p>THAT the colonies of America are entitled to the ſole and excluſive privilege of giving and granting their own money: that this involves a right of deliberating whether they will make any gift, for what purpoſes it ſhall be made, and what ſhall be its amount; and that it is a high breach of this privilege for any body of men, extraneous to their conſtitutions, to preſcribe the purpoſes for which money ſhall be levied on them, to take to themſelves the authority of judging of their conditions, circumſtances and ſituations, and of determining the amount of the contribution to be levied.</p>
            <p>THAT as the colonies poſſeſs a right of appropriating their gifts, ſo are they intitled at all times to enquire into their application, to ſee that they be not waſted among
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:016625_0022_0F9D7036EBF762E8"/>
the venal and corrupt, for the purpoſe of undermining the civil rights of the givers, nor yet be diverted to the ſupport of ſtanding armies, inconſiſtent with their freedom and ſubverſive of their quiet. To propoſe therefore, as this reſolution does, that the monies given by the colonies ſhall be ſubject to the diſpoſal of parliament alone, is to propoſe that they ſhall relinquiſh this right of enquiry, and put it in the power of others to render their gifts ruinous, in proportion as they are liberal.</p>
            <p>THAT this privilege of giving or of with-holding our monies, is an important barrier againſt the undue exertion of prerogative, which if left altogether without controul, may be exerciſed to our great oppreſſion; and all hiſtory ſhews how efficacious is its interceſſion for redreſs of griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances and re-eſtabliſhment of rights, and how improvident it would be to part with ſo powerful a mediator.</p>
            <p>WE are of opinion that the propoſition contained in this reſolution is unreaſonable and inſidious; unreaſonable, becauſe if we declare we accede to it, we declare without reſervation we will purchaſe the favour of parliament, not knowing at the ſame time at what price they will pleaſe to eſtimate their favour; it is inſidious, becauſe individual colonies having bid and bidden again, till they find the avidity of the ſeller too great for all their powers to ſatisfy, are then to return into oppoſition, divided from their ſiſter colonies, whom the miniſter will have previouſly detached by a grant of eaſier terms, or by an artful procraſtination of a definitive anſwer.</p>
            <p>THAT the ſuſpenſion of the exerciſe of their pretended power of taxation being expreſsly made commenſurate with the continuance of our gifts, theſe muſt be perpetual to make that ſo. Whereas no experience has ſhewn that a gift of perpetual revenue ſecures a perpetual return of duty or of kind diſpoſition. On the contrary, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament itſelf wiſely attentive to this obſervation, are in the eſtabliſhed practice of granting their ſupplies from year to year only.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:016625_0023_0F9D7037AA67D9A8"/>DESIROUS and determined as we are to conſider in the moſt diſpaſſionate view, every ſeeming advance towards a reconciliation made by the <hi>Britiſh</hi> parliament, let our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of <hi>Britain</hi> reflect what would have been the ſacrifice to men of free ſpirits, had even fair terms been profered, as theſe inſiduous propoſals were with circumſtances of inſult and defiance. A propoſition to give our money, accompanied with large fleets and armies, ſeems addreſſed to our fears rather than to our freedom. With what pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience would <hi>Britons</hi> have received articles of treaty from any power on earth, when borne on the point of a bayonet by military plenipotentaries?</p>
            <p>WE think the attempt unneceſſary to raiſe upon us by force or by threats our proportional contributions to the common defence, when all know, and themſelves acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, we have fully contributed whenever called upon to do ſo in the character of freemen.</p>
            <p>WE are of opinion it is not juſt that the colonies ſhould be required to oblige themſelves to other contributions, while <hi>Great-Britain</hi> poſſeſſes a monopoly of their trade. This of itſelf lays them under heavy contribution. To demand therefore additional aids in the form of a tax, is to demand the double of their equal proportion; if we are to contribute equally with the other parts of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, let us equally with them enjoy free commerce with the whole world. But while the reſtrictions on our trade ſhut to us the reſources of wealth, is it juſt we ſhould bear all other burthens equally with thoſe to whom every reſource is open?</p>
            <p>WE conceive that the <hi>Britiſh</hi> parliament has no right to intermeddle with our proviſions for the ſupport of civil government, or adminiſtration of juſtice. The proviſions we have made are ſuch as pleaſe ourſelves, and are agreeable to our own circumſtances: they anſwer the ſubſtantial pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of government and of juſtice, and other purpoſes than theſe ſhould not be anſwered. We do not mean that our people ſhall be burthened with oppreſſive taxes, to provide fine cures for the idle or the wicked, under colour of providing for a civil liſt. While parliament purſue
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:016625_0024_0F9D703869CA49B8"/>
their plan of civil government within their own juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, we alſo hope to purſue ours without moleſtation.</p>
            <p>WE are of opinion, the propoſition is altogether unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory, becauſe it imports only a ſuſpenſion of the mode, not a renunciation of the pretended right to tax us; becauſe too it does not propoſe to repeal the ſeveral acts of parliament paſſed for the purpoſes of reſtraining the trade, and altering the form of government of one of our colonies; extending the boundaries and changing the government of Quebec; enlarging the juriſdiction of the courts of admiralty and vice admiralty; taking from us the rights of trial by a jury of the vicinage, in caſes affecting both life and property; tranſporting us into other countries to be tried for criminal offences; exempting by mock-trial the murderers of coloniſts from puniſhment; and quartering ſoldiers on us in times of profound peace. Nor do they renounce the power of ſuſpending our own legiſlatures, and legiſlating for us themſelves in all caſes whatſoever. On the contrary, to ſhew they mean no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continuance of injury, they paſs acts at the very time of holding out this propoſition, for reſtraining the commerce and fiſheries of the provinces of <hi>New-England,</hi> and for interdicting the trade of other colonies with all foreign nations, and with each other. This proves unequivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally they mean not to relinquiſh the exerciſe of indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminate legiſlation over us.</p>
            <p>UPON the whole, this propoſition ſeems to have been held up to the world, to deceive it into a belief that there was nothing in diſpute between us but the mode of levying taxes; and that the parliament having now been ſo good as to give up this, the colonies are unreaſonable if not perfectly ſatisfied: whereas in truth, our adverſaries ſtill claim a right of demanding <hi>ad libitum,</hi> and of taxing us themſelves to the full amount of their demand, if we do not comply with it. This leaves us without any thing we can call property. But what is of more importance, and what in this propoſal they keep out of ſight, as if no ſuch point was now in conteſt between us, they claim a right to alter our charters and eſtabliſhed laws, and leave us without any ſecurity for our lives or liberties. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:016625_0025_0F9D703AAE49E250"/>
ſeems alſo to have been calculated more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to lull into fatal ſecurity our well-affected fellow ſubjects on the other ſide the water, till time ſhould be given for the operation of thoſe arms, which a <hi>Britiſh</hi> miniſter pronounced would inſtantaneouſly reduce the "cowardly" ſons of <hi>America</hi> to unreſerved ſubmiſſion."</p>
            <p>WHAT muſt always appear aſtoniſhing is, that the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh miniſtry could ever have ſuppoſed that the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion could be ſatisfactory, or rather that they could har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour a doubt, that it would be rejected with contempt; yet leſt this ſhould not be the caſe, no opportunity was ever given to try the efficacy of it: for on the nineteenth of April, the fatal blow was ſtruck at Lexington, which ſevered the empire. The reaſons are apparent. Their force and our weakneſs gave them unbounded confidence. They ſuppoſed themſelves certain of victory. They ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed us equally certain of defeat. Palpable therefore as was the artifice of the conciliatory motion, it was not impoſſible Congreſs at their meeting in May, might lay hold of it as a ground of treaty. If they ſhould, the good ſenſe and the juſtice of our fellow ſubjects might have interpoſed to prevent our deſtruction. No time therefore was to be loſt in putting that to the iſſue of arms, which would not bear the teſt of argument. It was hoped that the juſtice of our cauſe would be hidden by our inability to ſupport it; and their uſurpations diſguiſed and adorned by the ſplendors of ſucceſs. Here then commences a new aera.</p>
            <p>THE unprovoked hoſtilities at Lexington gave fire as might have been expected to the inflamable diſpoſitions excited throughout America. The call to arms was general, and the popular rage amounted almoſt to frenzy. But the emotion ſo ſuddenly and forcibly excited, daily became more moderate. The joys of victory by degrees ſilenced the mourning dirge. Wiſe and good men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted themſelves to aſſuage a tempeſt, the bounds and effects of whoſe violence neither wiſdom could foreſee nor virtue confine. The partizans of Great-Britain (for ſtrange as it may ſeem, ſuch there were) mingled with their fellow citizens and induſtriouſly gave a favourable turn to
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:016625_0026_0F9D703B70247680"/>
this atrocious act. It was not perhaps impoſſible even then to have ſtayed the deſtroying ſword. But as the neighbouring people had collected themſelves to prevent a repetition of the like injuries, upon the arrival of the generals Howe and Burgoyne, it was determined not to ſuffer that ſpirit to evaporate which was deemed neceſſary for the purpoſes of domination. At Bunker's Hill a ſecond and more bloody ſacrifice was made to the god of war. Leſt the intended acts of violence ſhould be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to accident, or to any other of the many cauſes which might be, and which by the friends of our enemies actually were aſſigned, and in order to intimidate the great council of America into a mean and abject ſubmiſſion, a perſon was ſent from the miniſtry to aſſure them of the truth of the following paper:</p>
            <p>"THAT it is earneſtly hoped by all the real friends of the Americans, that the terms expreſſed in the reſolution of the 20th of February laſt, will be accepted by all the colonies, who have the leaſt affection for their king and country, or a juſt ſenſe of their own intereſt.</p>
            <p>"THAT theſe terms are honourable for Great-Britain and ſafe for the colonies.</p>
            <p>"THAT if the colonies are not blinded by faction, theſe terms will remove every grievance relative to taxation, and be the baſis of a compact between the colonies and the mother country.</p>
            <p>"THAT the people in America ought, on every conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, to be ſatisfied with them.</p>
            <p>"THAT no further relaxation can be admitted.</p>
            <p>"THE temper and ſpirit of the nation are ſo much againſt conceſſions, that if it were the intention of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, they could not carry the queſtion.</p>
            <p>"BUT adminiſtration have no ſuch intention, as they are fully and firmly perſuaded, that further conceſſions would be injurious to the colonies as well as to Great-Britain.</p>
            <p>"THAT there is not the leaſt probability of a change of adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>"THAT they are perfectly united in opinion, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to purſue the moſt effectual meaſures, and to uſe
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:016625_0027_0F9D703C36062788"/>
the whole force of the kingdom, if it be found neceſſary, to reduce the rebellious and refractory provinces and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies.</p>
            <p>"THERE is ſo great a ſpirit in the nation againſt the Congreſs, that the people will bear the temporary diſtreſſes of a ſtoppage of the American trade.</p>
            <p>"THEY may depend on this to be true."</p>
            <p>THE conduct of the Congreſs at this time wore very much the appearance of puſillanimity, for after the Lex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington battle, while it was expected that the troops from England would arrive at New-York, the city and county of New-York, applied through their delegates for advice how to conduct themſelves;—upon which it was</p>
            <p>"RESOLVED, That it be recommended, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, to the inhabitants of New-York, that if the troops which are expected ſhould arrive, the ſaid colony act on the defenſive, ſo long as may be conſiſtent with their ſafety and ſecurity: that the troops be permitted to remain in the barracks, ſo long as they behave peaceably and quietly; but that they be not ſuffered to erect fortifications, or take any ſteps for cutting off the communication between the town and country; and that if they commit hoſtilities, or invade private property, the inhabitants ſhould defend themſelves and their property, and repel force by force: that the warlike ſtores be removed from the town: that places of retreat, in caſe of neceſſity, be provided for the women and children of New-York; and that a ſufficient number of men be embodied, and kept in conſtant readineſs for protecting the inhabitants from inſult and injury."</p>
            <p>BUT it muſt be remembered, that affairs were then in a very critical ſituation. Hudſon's river, which hath been conſidered as the key of America, was in the power of the enemy, if they choſe to take it. The people of that colony were much divided in ſentiment; the miniſtry had many partizans among them, excited by the hope of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and rewards; many from a fear of impending danger; all were apprehenſive of the conſequences of a war which reaſon and former experience ſerved to ſhew muſt rage in the bowels of that country. On the whole,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:016625_0028_0F9D703CEC1078C8"/>
therefore, it was probable that the efforts of the enemy would be turned that way, and that violent counſels might produce a ſerious defection. The conduct of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs may then be conſidered as wiſe and firm, for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after, they</p>
            <p>"RESOLVED unanimouſly, That his majeſty's moſt faithful ſubjects in theſe colonies are reduced to a danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and critical ſituation, by the attempts of the Britiſh miniſtry to carry into execution, by force of arms, ſeveral unconſtitutional and oppreſſive acts of the Britiſh parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for laying taxes in America; to enforce the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of thoſe taxes, and for altering and changing the conſtitution and internal police of ſome of theſe colonies, in violation of the natural and civil rights of the coloniſts.</p>
            <p>"HOSTILITIES being actually commenced in the Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts-Bay, by the Britiſh troops under the command of general Gage, and the lives of a number of the inhabitants of that colony deſtroyed, the town of Boſton having not only been long occupied as a garriſoned town in an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's country, but the inhabitants thereof treated with a ſeverity and cruelty not to be juſtified even towards declared enemies; large re-inforcements too being ordered and ſoon expected, for the declared purpoſe of compelling theſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies to ſubmit to the operation of the ſaid acts; that therefore, for the expreſs purpoſe of ſecuring and defending theſe colonies, and preſerving them in ſafety againſt all at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to carry the ſaid acts into execution by force of arms, theſe colonies be immediately put into a ſtate of defence.</p>
            <p>"BUT, as we moſt ardently wiſh for a reſtoration of the harmony formerly ſubſiſting between our mother country and theſe colonies, the interruption of which muſt, at all events, be exceedingly injurious to both countries, that with a ſincere deſign of contributing by all the means in our power, not incompatible with a juſt regard for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted rights and true intereſts of theſe colonies, to the promotion of this moſt deſireable reconciliation, an humble and dutiful petition be preſented to his majeſty.</p>

ſubſiſting between Great-Britain and theſe colonies, and that this be made a part of the petition to the king.</p>
            <p>"RESOLVED unanimouſly, That the militia of New-York be armed and trained, and in conſtant readineſs to act at a moment's warning; and that a number of men be immediately embodied and kept in that city, and ſo diſpoſed of as to give protection to the inhabitants, in caſe any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult ſhould be offered by the troops that may land there, and to prevent any attempts that may be made to gain poſſeſſion of the city, and interrupt its intercourſe with the country.</p>
            <p>"RESOLVED unanimouſly, That it be recommended to the provincial convention at New-York, to perſevere the more vigorouſly in preparing for their defence, as it is very uncertain whether the earneſt endeavours of the Congreſs, to accommodate the unhappy differences between Great-Britain and the colonies, by conciliatory meaſures, will be ſucceſsful."</p>
            <p>NO country perhaps in the world was ever in a more delicate ſituation than America at this period. Informed and diſcerning minds ſaw the moſt miſerable ſervitude on the one hand; and on the other, that they muſt be ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped of property, and ſuffer an ignominious death, without ſuch a coincidence of circumſtances as nothing but Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence could accompliſh. They ſaw one of the moſt powerful nations upon earth, whoſe fleets covered the ocean—whoſe flag had waved in triumph thro' the four quarters of the globe, ready to dart all her thunders againſt them; at the ſame time, America was without ſhips, without arms, without clothes, without money, without officers, without diſcipline, without a ſingle fortification, a very conſiderable faction ready to join her enemies, expoſed thro' an immenſe frontier to the irruptions of ſavage tribes, whoſe luſt of blood was daily ſtimulated by all the arts which an unfeeling inhuman policy could dictate; while a herd of ſlaves were urged by the inſidious offer of freedom, to plunge an aſſaſſin's dagger in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of domeſtic ſecurity. In this criſis, however, it was determined to riſk every thing, rather than tamely ſubmit to the yoke; but, at the ſame time, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to avoid as much as poſſible giving an alarm to the
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:016625_0030_0F9D703E69E85520"/>
people, by the mortifying diſplay of their comparative weakneſs. On the 6th of July, 1775, the Congreſs pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed the following declaration:</p>
            <p>"IF it was poſſible for men, who exerciſe their reaſon, to believe, that the Divine Author of our exiſtence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended a part of the human race to hold an abſolute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in, and an unbounded power over others, marked out by his infinite goodneſs and wiſdom, as the objects of a legal domination never rightfully reſiſtible, however ſevere and oppreſſive, the inhabitants of theſe colonies might at leaſt require from the parliament of Great-Britain ſome evidence, that this dreadful authority over them has been granted to that body. But a reverence for our great Creator, principles of humanity, and the dictates of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe, muſt convince all thoſe who reflect upon the ſubject, that government was inſtituted to promote the welfare of mankind, and ought to be adminiſtered for the attainment of that end. The legiſlature of Great-Britain, however, ſtimulated by an inordinate paſſion for a power not only unjuſtifiable, but which they know to be pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly reprobated by the very conſtitution of that kingdom, and deſperate of ſucceſs in any mode of conteſt, where regard ſhould be had to truth, law, or right, have at length, deſerting thoſe, attempted to effect their cruel and impolitic purpoſe of enſlaving theſe colonies by violence, and have thereby rendered it neceſſary for us to cloſe with their laſt appeal from reaſon to arms. Yet, however blinded that aſſembly may be, by their intemperate rage for unlimited domination, ſo to ſlight juſtice and the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of mankind, we eſteem ourſelves bound by obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of reſpect to the reſt of the world, to make known the juſtice of our cauſe.</p>
            <p>"OUR forefathers, inhabitants of the iſland of Great-Britain, left their native land to ſeek on theſe ſhores a reſidence for civil and religious freedom. At the expence of their blood, at the hazard of their fortunes, without the leaſt charge to the country from which they removed, by unceaſing labour and an unconquerable ſpirit, they effected ſettlements in the diſtant and inhoſpitable wilds of America, then filled with numerous and warlike nations of barbarians. Societies or governments, veſted with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:016625_0031_0F9D703F2B092A88"/>
legiſlatures, were formed under charters from the crown, and an harmonious intercourſe was eſtabliſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the colonies and the kingdom from which they derived their origin. The mutual benefits of this union became in a ſhort time ſo extraordinary, as to excite aſtoniſhment. It is univerſally confeſſed, that the amazing increaſe of the wealth, ſtrength, and navigation of the realm, aroſe from this ſource; and the miniſter, who ſo wiſely and ſucceſsfully directed the meaſures of Great-Britain in the late war, publicly declared, that theſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies enabled her to triumph over her enemies. Towards the concluſion of that war, it pleaſed our ſovereign to make a change in his counſels. From that fatal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the affairs of the Britiſh empire began to fall into confuſion, and gradually ſliding from the ſummit of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious proſperity, to which they had been advanced by the virtues and abilities of one man, are at length diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by the convulſions, that now ſhake it to its deepeſt foundations. The new miniſtry finding the brave foes of Britain, though frequently defeated, yet ſtill contending, took up the unfortunate idea of granting them a haſty peace, and of then ſubduing her faithful friends.</p>
            <p>"THESE devoted colonies were judged to be in ſuch a ſtate, as to preſent victories without bloodſhed, and all the eaſy emoluments of ſtatuteable plunder. The uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted tenor of their peaceable and reſpectful behaviour from the beginning of colonization, their dutiful, zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and uſeful ſervices during the war, though ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently and amply acknowleged in the moſt honourable manner by his majeſty, by the late king, and by parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, could not ſave them from the meditated innovations. Parliament was influenced to adopt the pernicious project, and aſſuming a new power over them, have in the courſe of eleven years given ſuch deciſive ſpecimens of the ſpirit and conſequences attending this power, as to leave no doubt concerning the effects of acquieſcence under it. They have undertaken to give and grant our money with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our conſent, though we have ever exerciſed an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive right to diſpoſe of our own property; ſtatutes have been paſſed for extending the juriſdiction of courts of admiralty and vice-admiralty beyond their ancient limits;
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:016625_0032_0F9D703FE9A32248"/>
for depriving us of the accuſtomed and ineſtimable pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of trial by jury in caſes affecting both life and property; for ſuſpending the legiſlature of one of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies; for interdicting all commerce to the capital of another; and for altering fundamentally the form of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment eſtabliſhed by charter, and ſecured by acts of its own legiſlature ſolemnly confirmed by the crown; for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empting the "murderers" of coloniſts from legal trial, and in effect, from puniſhment; for erecting in a neighbouring province, acquired by the joint arms of Great-Britain and America, a deſpotiſm dangerous to our very exiſtence; and for quartering ſoldiers upon the coloniſts in time of profound peace. It has alſo been reſolved in parliament, that coloniſts charged with committing certain offences, ſhall be tranſported to England to be tried.</p>
            <p>"BUT why ſhould we enumerate our injuries in detail? By one ſtatute it is declared, that parliament can "of right make laws to bind us <hi>in all caſes whatſoever.</hi>" What is to defend us againſt ſo enormous, ſo unlimited a power? Not a ſingle man of thoſe who aſſume it, is choſen by us; or is ſubject to our controul or influence; but on the contrary, they are all of them exempt from the operation of ſuch laws, and an American revenue, if not diverted from the oſtenſible purpoſes for which it is raiſed, would actually lighten their own burdens in proportion, as they increaſe ours. We ſaw the miſery to which ſuch deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potiſm would reduce us. We for ten years inceſſantly and ineffectually beſieged the throne as ſupplicants; we reaſoned, we remonſtrated with parliament in the moſt mild and decent language.</p>
            <p>"ADMINISTRATION, ſenſible that we ſhould regard theſe oppreſſive meaſures as freemen ought to do, ſent over fleets and armies to enforce them. The indignation of the Americans was rouſed, it is true; but it was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation of a virtuous, loyal, and affectionate people. A Congreſs of delegates from the United Colonies was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled at Philadelphia, on the fifth day of laſt September. We reſolved again to offer an humble and dutiful petition to the king, and alſo addreſſed our fellow ſubjects of Great-Britain. We have purſued every temperate, every reſpectful meaſure; we have even proceeded to break off our commercial intercourſe with our fellow ſubjects, as
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:016625_0033_0F9D7040A970AC50"/>
the laſt peaceable admonition, that our attachment to no nation upon earth ſhould ſupplant our attachment to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. This, we flattered ourſelves, was the ultimate ſtep of the controverſy: but ſubſequent events have ſhewn, how vain was this hope of finding moderation in our enemies.</p>
            <p>"SEVERAL threatening expreſſions againſt the colonies were inſerted in his majeſty's ſpeech; our petition, tho' we were told it was a decent one, and that his majeſty had been pleaſed to receive it graciouſly, and to promiſe laying it before his parliament, was huddled into both houſes among a bundle of American papers, and there neglected. The lords and commons in their addreſs, in the month of February, ſaid, that "a rebellion at that time actually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſted within the province of Maſſachuſetts-Bay; and that thoſe concerned in it, had been countenanced and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by unlawful combinations and engagements, entered into by his majeſty's ſubjects in ſeveral of the other co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies; and therefore they beſought his majeſty, that he would take the moſt effectual meaſures to inforce due obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the laws and authority of the ſupreme legiſlature." Soon after the commercial intercourſe of whole colonies, with foreign countries, and with each other, was cut off by an act of parliament; by another, ſeveral of them were entirely prohibited from the fiſheries in the ſeas near their coaſts, on which they always depended for their ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; and large reinforcements of ſhips and troops were immediately ſent over to general Gage.</p>
            <p>"FRUITLESS were all the entreaties, arguments, and eloquence of an illuſtrious band of the moſt diſtinguiſhed peers and commoners, who nobly and ſtrenuouſly aſſerted the juſtice of our cauſe, to ſtay, or even to mitigate the heedleſs fury with which theſe accumulated and unexam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled outrages were hurried on. Equally fruitleſs was the interference of the city of London, of Briſtol, and many other reſpectable towns, in our favour. Parliament adopted an inſidious manoeuvre calculated to divide us, to eſtabliſh a perpetual auction of taxations where colony ſhould bid againſt colony, all of them uninformed what ranſom ſhould redeem their lives; and thus to extort from us, at the point of the bayonet, the unknown ſums that ſhould be ſufficient to gratify, if poſſible to gratify, miniſterial ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:016625_0034_0F9D70416963FE38"/>
with the miſerable indulgence left to us of raiſing, in our own mode, the preſcribed tribute. What terms more rigid and humiliating could have been dictated by remorſeleſs victors to conquered enemies? In our circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances to accept them, would be to deſerve them.</p>
            <p>"SOON after the intelligence of theſe proceedings ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived on this continent, general Gage, who in the courſe of the laſt year had taken poſſeſſion of the town of Boſton, in the province of Maſſachuſett's-Bay, and ſtill occupied it as a garriſon, on the 19th day of April, ſent out from that place a large detachment of his army, who made an unprovoked aſſault on the inhabitants of the ſaid province, at the town of Lexington, as appears by the affidavits of a great number of perſons, ſome of whom were officers and ſoldiers of that detachment, murdered eight of the inhabitants, and wounded many others. From thence the troops proceeded in warlike array to the town of Concord, where they ſet upon another party of the inhabitants of the ſame province, killing ſeveral and wounding more, until compelled to retreat by the country people ſuddenly aſſembled to repel this cruel aggreſſion. Hoſtilities, thus commenced by the Britiſh troops, have been ſince proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by them without regard to faith or reputation. The inhabitants of Boſton being confined within that town by the general their governor, and having, in order to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their diſmiſſion, entered into a treaty with him, it was ſtipulated, that the ſaid inhabitants having depoſited their arms with their own magiſtrates, ſhould have liberty to depart, taking with them their other effects. They accordingly delivered up their arms, but in open violation of honour, in defiance of the obligation of treaties, which even ſavage nations eſteemed ſacred, the governor ordered the arms depoſited as aforeſaid, that they might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for their owners, to be ſeized by a body of ſoldiers; detained the greateſt part of the inhabitants in the town, and compelled the few who were permitted to retire, to leave their moſt valuable effects behind.</p>
            <p>"BY this perfidy wives are ſeparated from their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, children from their parents, the aged and the ſick from their relations and friends, who wiſh to attend and comfort them; and thoſe who have been uſed to live in plenty and even elegance, are reduced to deplorable diſtreſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:016625_0035_0F9D7042299BD330"/>"THE general, further emulating his miniſterial maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, by a proclamation bearing date on the 12th day of June, after venting the groſſeſt falſehoods and calumnies againſt the good people of theſe colonies, proceeds to <q>declare them all, either by name or deſcription, to be rebels and traitors, to ſuperſede the courſe of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law, and inſtead thereof to publiſh and order the uſe and exerciſe of the law martial.</q> His troops have butchered our countrymen, have wantonly burnt Charles-town, beſides a conſiderable number of houſes in other places; our ſhips and veſſels are ſeized; the neceſſary ſupplies of proviſions are intercepted, and he is exerting his utmoſt power to ſpread deſtruction and devaſtation around him.</p>
            <p>"WE have received certain intelligence, that general Carleton, the governor of Canada, is inſtigating the people of that province, and the Indians, to fall upon us; and we have but too much reaſon to apprehend, that ſchemes have been formed to excite domeſtic enemies againſt us. In brief, a part of theſe colonies now feel, and all of them are ſure of feeling, as far as the vengeance of adminiſtration can inflict them, the complicated calamities of fire, ſword, and famine. We are reduced to the alternative of chuſing an unconditional ſubmiſſion to the tyranny of irritated miniſters, or reſiſtance by force. The latter is our choice. We have counted the coſt of this conteſt, and find nothing ſo dreadful as voluntary ſlavery. Honour, juſtice, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, forbid us tamely to ſurrender that freedom which we received from our gallant anceſtors, and which our innocent poſterity have a right to receive from us. We cannot endure the infamy and guilt of reſigning ſucceeding generations to that wretchedneſs which inevitably awaits them, if we baſely entail hereditary bondage upon them.</p>
            <p>"OUR cauſe is juſt. Our union is perfect. Our internal reſources are great, and, if neceſſary, foreign aſſiſtance is undoubtedly attainable. We gratefully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, as ſignal inſtances of the Divine favour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, that his Providence would not permit us to be called into this ſevere controverſy, until we were grown up to our preſent ſtrength, had been previouſly exerciſed in warlike operation, and poſſeſſed of the means of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending ourſelves.

reflections, we moſt ſolemnly, before God and the world, DECLARE, that, exerting the utmoſt energy of thoſe powers, which our beneficent Creator hath graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly beſtowed upon us, the arms we have been compelled by our enemies to aſſume, we will, in defiance of every hazard, with unabating firmneſs and perſeverance, employ for the preſervation of our liberties; being with one mind reſolved to die freemen rather than to live ſlaves.</p>
            <p>"LEST this declaration ſhould diſquiet the minds of our friends and fellow ſubjects in any part of the empire, we aſſure them that we mean not to diſſolve that union which has ſo long and ſo happily ſubſiſted between us, and which we ſincerely wiſh to ſee reſtored. Neceſſity has not yet driven us into that deſperate meaſure, or induced us to excite any other nation to war againſt them. We have not raiſed armies with ambitious deſigns of ſeparating from Great-Britain, and eſtabliſhing independent ſtates. We fight not for glory or for conqueſt. We exhibit to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind the remarkable ſpectacle of a people attacked by unprovoked enemies, without any imputation or even ſuſpicion of offence. <hi>They</hi> boaſt of their privileges and civilization, and yet profer no milder conditions than ſervitude or death.</p>
            <p>"IN our own native land, in defence of the freedom that is our birth-right, and which we ever enjoyed till the late violation of it—for the protection of our property, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired ſolely by the honeſt induſtry of our fore-fathers and ourſelves, againſt violence actually offered, we have taken up arms. We ſhall lay them down when hoſtilities ſhall ceaſe on the part of the aggreſſors, and all danger of their being renewed ſhall be removed, and not before.</p>
            <p>"WITH an humble confidence in the mercies of the ſupreme and impartial judge and ruler of the univerſe, we moſt devoutly implore his divine goodneſs to protect us happily through this great conflict, to diſpoſe our adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries to reconciliation on reaſonable terms, and thereby to relieve the empire from the calamities of civil war."</p>

the tendereſt, moſt perſuaſive language, and ſhe cannot ſpeak in vain. Tho' it was evident as the ſun, that the king and parliament of Great-Britain had determined never to ſheathe the ſword, but upon the unconditional ſubmiſſion of America to the moſt humiliating bondage; yet, in a delirium of their former attachment, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs prepared another petition to the king, and another addreſs to the people of England. Strange as it may ſeem, it is nevertheleſs true, that notwithſtanding all our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts were clearly oppoſed to the meaſure, ſtill a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with the people, and ſubjection to the ſovereign of Great-Britain, were conſidered as the moſt deſirable of human events: for it may truly be affirmed, that next to the love of liberty, loyalty to his prince, and love of his fellow ſubjects, were the ruling paſſions of an American's boſom. The prophetic language contained in this peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and addreſs is remarkable; and altho' it was treated by our enemies with the ſame contempt as our ſolemn pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions not to ſubmit to their tyranny, yet now that, the heat of the chaſe being abated, a cool moment of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection preſſes itſelf upon them, it is probable they will, when too late, give to both their ſhare of credit.</p>

                        <p>"IN the proſecution of this attempt, events ſo unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to the deſign took place, that every friend to the intereſt of Great-Britain and theſe colonies, entertained pleaſing and reaſonable expectations of ſeeing an additional force and exertion immediately given to the operations of the union hitherto experienced, by an enlargement of the dominions of the crown, and the removal of ancient and warlike enemies to a greater diſtance.</p>

But happily we are not without reſources; and though the timid and humiliating appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of a Britiſh miniſtry ſhould prevail with foreign nations, yet induſtry, prompted by neceſſity, will not leave us without the neceſſary ſupplies.</p>
                        <p>"WE could wiſh to go no further, and, not to wound the ear of humanity, leave untold thoſe rigorous acts of oppreſſion, which are daily exerciſed in the town of Boſton, did we not hope, that by diſclaiming their deeds and puniſhing the perpetrators, you would ſhortly vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the honour of the Britiſh name and re-eſtabliſh the violated laws of juſtice.</p>
                        <p>"THAT once populous, flouriſhing, and commercial town is now garriſoned by an army ſent not to protect, but to enſlave its inhabitants. The civil government is overturned, and a military deſpotiſm erected upon its

ruins. Without law, without right, powers are aſſumed unknown to the conſtitution. Private property is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly invaded. The inhabitants, daily ſubjected to the licentiouſneſs of the ſoldiery, are forbid to remove in defiance of their natural rights, in violation of the moſt ſolemn compacts. Or if, after long and weariſome ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, a paſs is procured, their effects are detained, and even thoſe who are moſt favoured, have no alternative but poverty or ſlavery. The diſtreſs of many thouſand people, wantonly deprived of the neceſſaries of life, is a ſubject, on which we would not wiſh to enlarge.</p>
                        <p>"YET we cannot but obſerve, that a <hi>Britiſh</hi> fleet (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtified even by acts of your legiſlature) are daily employed in ruining our commerce, ſeizing our ſhips, and depriving whole communities of their daily bread. Nor will a regard for your honour permit us to be ſilent, while <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> troops ſully your glory, by actions, which the moſt inveterate enmity will not palliate among civilized na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the wanton and unneceſſary deſtruction of Charles-town, a large, ancient, and once populous town, juſt before deſerted by its inhabitants, who had fled to avoid the fury of your ſoldiery.</p>
                        <p>"IF you ſtill retain thoſe ſentiments of compaſſion, by which <hi>Britons</hi> have ever been diſtinguiſhed; if the humanity, which tempered the valour of our common anceſtors, has not degenerated into cruelty, you will la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the miſeries of their deſcendents.</p>
                        <p>"TO what are we to attribute this treatment? If to any ſecret principle of the conſtitution, let it be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; let us learn, that the government we have long revered, is not without its defects, and that while it gives freedom to a part, it neceſſarily enſlaves the remainder of the empire. If ſuch a principle exiſts, why for ages has it ceaſed to operate? Why at this time is it called into action? Can no reaſon be aſſigned for this conduct? Or muſt it be reſolved into the wanton exerciſe of arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary power? And ſhall the deſcendents of <hi>Britons</hi> tamely ſubmit to this? No, ſirs! we never will, while we revere the memory of our gallant and virtuous anceſtors, we never can ſurrender thoſe glorious privileges, for which they fought, bled and conquered. Admit that your fleets could deſtroy our towns, and ravage our ſea-coaſts; theſe
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:016625_0045_0F9D704A6F9FAE50"/>
are inconſiderable objects; things of no moment to men, whoſe boſoms glow with the ardor of liberty. We can retire beyond the reach of your navy, and, without any ſenſible diminution of the neceſſaries of life, enjoy a luxury, which from that period you will want; the luxury of being free.</p>
                        <p>"WE know the force of your arms, and was it called forth in the cauſe of juſtice and your country, we might dread the exertion; but will <hi>Britons</hi> fight under the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of tyranny? Will they counteract the labours, and diſgrace the victories of their anceſtors? Will they forge chains for their poſterity? If they deſcend to this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy taſk, will their ſwords retain their edge, their arms their accuſtomed vigour? <hi>Britons</hi> can never become the inſtruments of oppreſſion, till they loſe the ſpirit of freedom, by which alone they are invincible.</p>
                        <p>"OUR enemies charge us with ſedition. In what does it conſiſt? In our refuſal to ſubmit to unwarrantable acts of injuſtice and cruelty? If ſo, ſhew us a period in your hiſtory, in which you have not been equally ſeditious.</p>
                        <p>"WE are accuſed of aiming at independence; but how is this accuſation ſupported? By the allegations of your miniſters, not by our actions. Abuſed, inſulted, and contemned, what ſteps have we purſued to obtain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs? We have carried our dutiful petitions to the throne. We have applied to your juſtice for relief. We have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched our luxury, and with-held our trade.</p>
                        <p>"THE advantages of our commerce were deſigned as a compenſation for your protection: when you ceaſed to protect, for what were we to compenſate?</p>
                        <p>"WHAT has been the ſucceſs of our endeavours?

                        <p>"EVEN under theſe circumſtances, what meaſures have we taken that betray a deſire of independence? Have we called in the aid of thoſe foreign powers, who are the rivals of your grandeur? When your troops were few and defenceleſs, did we take advantage of their diſtreſs and expel them our towns? Or have we permitted them to

                        <p>"LET not <hi>your</hi> enemies and <hi>ours</hi> perſuade you, that in this we were influenced by fear or any other unworthy motive.

When hoſtilities were commenced, when on a late occaſion we were wantonly attacked by your troops, though we repelled their aſſaults and returned their blows, yet we lamented the wounds they obliged us to give; nor have we yet learned to rejoice at a victory over Engliſhmen.</p>
                        <p>"AS we wiſh not to colour our actions, or diſguiſe our thoughts; we ſhall, in the ſimple language of truth, avow the meaſures we have purſued, the motives upon which we have acted, and our future deſigns.</p>
                        <p>"WHEN our late petition to the throne produced no other effect than freſh injuries, and votes of your legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture calculated to juſtify every ſeverity; when your fleets and your armies were prepared to wreſt from us our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, to rob us of our liberties or our lives; when the hoſtile attempts of general Gage evinced his deſigns, we levied armies for our ſecurity and defence. When the powers veſted in the governor of Canada, gave us reaſon to apprehend danger from that quarter: and we had fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent intimations, that a cruel and ſavage enemy was to be let looſe upon the defenceleſs inhabitants of our fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers; we took ſuch meaſures as prudence dictated, as neceſſity will juſtify. We poſſeſſed ourſelves of Crown-Point and Ticonderoga. Yet give us leave moſt ſolemnly to aſſure you, that we have not yet loſt ſight of the object we have ever had in view, a reconciliation with you on conſtitutional principles, and a reſtoration of that friendly intercourſe, which, to the advantage of both, we till lately maintained.</p>
                        <p>"THE inhabitants of this country apply themſelves chiefly to agriculture and commerce. As their faſhions and manners are ſimilar to yours, your markets muſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford them the conveniencies and luxuries, for which they exchange the produce of their labours.

You are too reaſonable to expect, that by taxes (in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to this) we ſhould contribute to your expence; to believe after diverting the fountain, that the ſtreams can flow with unabated force.</p>
                        <p>"IT has been ſaid, that we refuſe to ſubmit to the reſtrictions on our commerce. From whence is this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference drawn? Not from our words, we having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly declared the contrary; and we again profeſs our ſubmiſſion to the ſeveral acts of trade and navigation paſſed before the year 1763, truſting nevertheleſs in the equity and juſtice of parliament, that ſuch of them as, upon cool and impartial conſideration, ſhall appear to have impoſed unneceſſary or grievous reſtrictions, will, at ſome happier period, be repealed or altered. And we cheerfully conſent to the operation of ſuch acts of the Britiſh par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament as ſhall be reſtrained to the regulation of our external commerce, for the purpoſe of ſecuring the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial advantages of the whole empire to the mother country, and the commercial benefits of its reſpective members; excluding every idea of taxation internal or external, for raiſing a revenue on the ſubjects in America without their conſent.</p>
                        <p>"IT is alleged that we contribute nothing to the common defence. To this we anſwer, that the advantages which Great-Britain receives from the monopoly of our trade, far exceed our proportion of the expence neceſſary for that purpoſe. But ſhould theſe advantages be inade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate thereto, let the reſtrictions on our trade be removed, and we will cheerfully contribute ſuch proportion when conſtitutionally required.</p>
                        <p>"IT is a fundamental principle of the Britiſh conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, that every man ſhould have at leaſt a repreſentative ſhare in the formation of thoſe laws, by which he is bound. Were it otherwiſe, the regulation of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal police by a Britiſh parliament, who are and ever will be unacquainted with our local circumſtances, muſt be always inconvenient, and frequently oppreſſive, working our wrong, without yielding any poſſible advantage to you.</p>
                        <p>"A PLAN of accommodation (as it has been abſurdly called) has been propoſed by your miniſters to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective aſſemblies. Were this propoſal <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

the offer, it would not be unexceptionable. Can men deliberate with the bayonet at their breaſt? Can they treat with freedom, while their towns are ſacked; when daily inſtances of injuſtice and oppreſſion diſturb the ſlower operations of reaſon?</p>
                        <p>"IF this propoſal is really ſuch as you would offer and we accept, why was it delayed till the nation was put to uſeleſs expence, and we were reduced to our preſent me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy ſituation? If it holds forth nothing, why was it propoſed? Unleſs indeed to deceive you into a belief, that we were unwilling to liſten to any terms of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation? But what is ſubmitted to our conſideration? We contend for the diſpoſal of our property. We are told that our demand is unreaſonable, that our aſſemblies may indeed collect our money, but that they muſt at the ſame time offer, not what your exigencies or ours may require, but ſo much as ſhall be deemed ſufficient to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy the deſires of a miniſter and enable him to provide for favourites and dependents. A recurrence to your own treaſury will convince you how little of the money al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready extorted from us has been applied to the relief of your burthens. To ſuppoſe that we would thus graſp the ſhadow and give up the ſubſtance, is adding inſult to injuries.</p>
                        <p>"WE have nevertheleſs again preſented an humble and dutiful petition to our ſovereign; and to remove every imputation of obſtinacy, have requeſted his majeſty to direct ſome mode, by which the united applications of his faithful coloniſts may be improved into a happy and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent reconciliation.

                        <p>"YET conclude not from this that we propoſe to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render our property into the hands of your miniſtry, or veſt your parliament with a power which may terminate in our deſtruction.

On the ſword, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we are compelled to rely for protection. Should victory declare in your favour, yet men trained to arms from their infancy, and animated by the love of liberty, will afford neither a cheap or eaſy conqueſt. Of this at leaſt we are aſſured, that our ſtruggle will be glorious, our ſucceſs certain; ſince even in death we ſhall find that freedom which in life you forbid us to enjoy.</p>
                        <p>"LET us now aſk what advantages are to attend our reduction? The trade of a ruined and deſolate country is always inconſiderable, its revenue trifling; the expence of ſubjecting and retaining it in ſubjection certain and inevitable.

                        <p>"SOLDIERS who have ſheathed their ſwords in the bowels of their American brethren, will not draw them with more reluctance againſt you. When too late you may lament the loſs of that freedom, which we exhort you, while ſtill in your power, to preſerve.</p>

                        <p>THE conduct obſerved towards the Indian nations was in perfect conſiſtence with that diſpoſition for peace ſo openly declared, and ſo fully manifeſted. Taught by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity to feel for the woes, and by freedom to reſpect the rights of mankind, we wiſhed to avoid that ſavage war which knows no laws but indiſcriminate ſlaughter. And altho' our enemies have endeavoured to ſtigmatize us with the deſign of employing the hatchet againſt them, in order to caſt a veil over their own barbarity; yet the fact is, that we ſedulouſly avoided it, and have at length been expoſed to the fury of thoſe tribes, becauſe we would not take advantage of their inhuman thirſt of blood againſt our fellow men.</p>
                        <p>IT was not until the 25th of November, 1775, that the Congreſs determined to retort upon our enemies the practice of taking property on the high ſeas. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered us as rebels, they had no laws in exiſtence whereby our property was forfeited. Unleſs we were conſidered as independent, their ſovereign could not authorize the capture of veſſels; and yet, in defiance of law, of reaſon, and of juſtice, they heſitated not to plunder indiſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately all thoſe who reſided in America, among whom not a few were adherents to their cauſe.</p>
                        <p>NOR did the Congreſs even then make reprizals upon private property, but leveled their reſentment at thoſe only who were engaged in aiding and aſſiſting the armies

employed againſt us; nor did they until the 23d of March, 1776, adopt the latter meaſure, the reaſons of which are fully ſet forth in the following preamble:</p>
                        <p>"WHEREAS the petitions of the United Colonies to the king, for the redreſs of great and manifold grievances, have not only been rejected, but treated with ſcorn and contempt, and the oppoſition to deſigns evidently formed to reduce them to a ſtate of ſervile ſubjection, and their neceſſary defence againſt hoſtile forces actually employed to ſubdue them, declared rebellion; and whereas an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt war hath been commenced againſt them, which the commanders of the Britiſh fleets and armies have proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, and ſtill continue to proſecute, with their utmoſt vigour, and in a cruel manner waſting, ſpoiling, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the country, burning houſes and defenceleſs towns, and expoſing the helpleſs inhabitants to every miſery from the inclemency of the winter, and not only urging ſavages to invade the country, but inſtigating negroes to murder their maſters; and whereas the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of Great-Britain hath lately paſſed an act, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming theſe colonies to be in open rebellion, forbidding all trade and commerce with the inhabitants thereof, until they ſhall accept pardons, and ſubmit to deſpotic rule, declaring their property, wherever found upon the water, liable to ſeizure and confiſcation, and enacting, that what had been done there, by virtue of the royal authority, were juſt and lawful acts, and ſhall be ſo deemed; from all which it is manifeſt, that the iniquitous ſcheme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed to deprive them of the liberty they have a right to by the laws of nature and the Engliſh conſtitution, will be pertinaciouſly purſued: it being therefore neceſſary to provide for their defence and ſecurity, and juſtifiable to make repriſals upon their enemies, and otherwiſe to annoy them according to the laws and uſages of nations, the Congreſs, truſting that ſuch of their friends in Great-Britain (of whom it is confeſſed there are many intitled to applauſe and gratitude for their patriotiſm and benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and in whoſe favour a diſcrimination of property cannot be made) as ſhall ſuffer by captures, will impute it to the authors of our common calamities, do declare and reſolve, as followeth."</p>

For not only was the moſt generous proviſion made to clothe and to feed thoſe priſoners whom the fortune of war had placed in our power, but leſt the provocations they had received might ſtimulate individuals to revenge, we find that on the 2d of January, 1776, the Congreſs came to the following reſolution, viz.</p>
                        <p>"WHEREAS the execrable barbarity with which this unhappy war has been conducted on the part of our enemies, ſuch as burning our defenceleſs towns and vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, expoſing their inhabitants, without regard to ſex or age, to all the miſeries which loſs of property, the rigour of the ſeaſon, and inhuman devaſtation can inflict, exciting domeſtic inſurrections and murders, bribing ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages to deſolate our frontiers, and caſting ſuch of us as the fortune of war has put in their power, into goals, there to languiſh in irons and in want, compelling the inhabitants of Boſton, in violation of the treaty, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main confined within the town, expoſed to the inſolence of the ſoldiery, and other enormities, at the mention of which decency and humanity will ever bluſh, may juſtly provoke the inhabitants of theſe colonies to rataliate;</p>
                        <p>"RESOLVED, That it be recommended to them to continue mindful that humanity ought to diſtinguiſh the brave, that cruelty ſhould find no admiſſion among a free people, and to take care that no page in the annals of America be ſtained by a recital of any action which juſtice or chriſtianity may condemn, and to reſt aſſured that whenever retaliation may be neceſſary or tend to their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, this Congreſs will undertake the diſagreeable taſk."</p>
                        <p>IT muſt be remarked, that this reſolution was paſſed when the moſt ample means of retaliation were in our power, and the affairs of America wore the moſt promiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſpect, for the defeat before Quebec was not yet known, but, on the contrary, it was expected that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital

fortreſs would ſoon fall into our hands. Thouſands on this continent would not have wept in anguiſh for the loſs of a huſband, a father, or a friend, had the ſame emotions of philanthropy pervaded the boſoms of our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors. But the ſtroke of divine juſtice ſeems to have been ſuſpended until their cup of guilt was filled with the widows and the orphans tears.</p>
                        <p>NOTWITHSTANDING the efforts which had been made for reconciliation, the proſpect of it ſeemed every moment to be more remote. Every account from Great-Britain ſerved to confirm the opinion, that nothing ſhort of an unconditional ſubmiſſion on our part would be accepted; and every day's enquiry convinced the unprejudiced, that we had every thing to fear from a connection with them. As the governments of the ſeveral colonies had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed under authority from the king of Great-Britain, they were reduced to the alternative of being in a manner without government, or of inſtituting new ſyſtems on a baſis purely republican. The former was choſen, as the latter would have tended greatly to impede a future con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection. But a ſtate of political anarchy could not long be tolerable to any ſociety: the evils reſulting from it muſt at length have produced the moſt fatal conſequences; and it was impoſſible to foreſee what might be the event of a conteſt in which mankind were ſet looſe from the reſtraints of law. Impreſſed with theſe ideas, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs on the 15th of May, 1776, publiſhed the following reſolution:</p>

            <p>THE conduct of Great-Britain was ſtill the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound of violence and fraud. While the ſtores of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical artifice were exhauſted, to prevent us from obtaining foreign aid, nothing, which money or promiſes could ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect was left undone, to collect the mercenaries of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many for our ſubjugation. Foiled in their former efforts, they called forth all their ſtrength; and to lull us into ſecurity at the ſame time, endeavoured to cover their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns with the thin veil of reconciliation. For this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they paſſed an act of parliament, and in conſequence of it appointed commiſſioners, with power to grant par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons to thoſe Americans, who would be ſo guilty as to ſolicit them. At length, fully convinced of what reaſon had long dictated, that no rational ſecurity for our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties could be obtained during a connection with Great-Britain, and that every idea of dependence tended to enfeeble our efforts, in a cauſe on which every thing was at ſtake, the fine ſpun thread, which held the two countries to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, was cut on the memorable 4th of July, 1776, by the following</p>

bands which have connected them with another, and to aſſume, among the powers of the earth, the ſeparate and equal ſtation to which the laws of nature and of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's God entitle them, a decent reſpect to the opinions of mankind requires that they ſhould declare the cauſes which impel them to the ſeparation.</p>
                        <p>"WE hold theſe truths to be ſelf-evident; that all men are created equal; that they are endowed, by their Creator, with certain unalienable rights; that among theſe are life, liberty, and the purſuit of happineſs.—That to ſecure theſe rights, governments are inſtituted among men, deriving their juſt powers from the conſent of the governed; that whenever any form of government becomes deſtructive of theſe ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to aboliſh it, and to inſtitute new go<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vernment, laying its foundation on ſuch principles, and organizing its powers in ſuch form, as to them ſhall ſeem moſt likely to effect their ſafety and happineſs. Prudence, indeed, will dictate, that governments long eſtabliſhed, ſhould not be changed for light and tranſient cauſes; and accordingly all experience hath ſhewn, that mankind are more diſpoſed to ſuffer, while evils are ſufferable, than to right themſelves by aboliſhing the forms to which they are accuſtomed. But when a long train of abuſes and uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations, purſuing invariably the ſame object, evinces a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to reduce them under abſolute deſpotiſm, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off ſuch government, and to provide new guards for their future ſecurity. Such has been the patient ſufferance of theſe colonies; and ſuch is now the neceſſity which conſtrains them to alter their former ſyſtems of government. The hiſtory of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent king of Great-Britain is a hiſtory of repeated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries and uſurpations, all having in direct object the eſtabliſhment of an abſolute tyranny over theſe ſtates. To prove this, let facts be ſubmitted to a candid world:</p>
                        <p>"HE has refuſed his aſſent to laws the moſt wholeſome and neceſſary for the public good.</p>

                        <p>"HE has called together legiſlative bodies at places un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual, uncomfortable, and diſtant from the depoſitory of their public records, for the ſole purpoſe of fatiguing them into compliance with his meaſures.</p>
                        <p>"HE has diſſolved repreſentative houſes repeatedly, for oppoſing, with manly firmneſs, his invaſions on the rights of the people.</p>
                        <p>"HE has refuſed for a long time, after ſuch diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, to cauſe others to be elected; whereby the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative powers, incapable of annihilation, have returned to the people at large for their exerciſe; the ſtate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, in the mean time, expoſed to all the dangers of invaſion from without, and convulſions within.</p>
                        <p>"HE has endeavoured to prevent the population of theſe ſtates; for that purpoſe obſtructing the laws for na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalization of foreigners; refuſing to paſs others to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage their migrations hither, and raiſing the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of new appropriations of lands.</p>
                        <p>"HE has obſtructed the adminiſtration of juſtice, by refuſing his aſſent to laws for eſtabliſhing judiciary powers.</p>
                        <p>"HE has made judges dependent on his will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their ſalaries.</p>

                        <p>"HE has affected to render the military independent of, and ſuperior to the civil power.</p>
                        <p>"HE has combined with others to ſubject us to a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction foreign to our conſtitution, and unacknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by our laws; giving his aſſent to their acts of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended legiſlation:</p>

                        <p>"HE is, at this time, tranſporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to complete the works of death, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, and tyranny, already begun with circumſtances of cruelty and perfidy, ſcarcely paralleled in the moſt bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous ages, and totally unworthy the head of a civilized nation.</p>
                        <p>"HE has conſtrained our fellow-citizens, taken cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive on the high ſeas, to bear arms againſt their country, to become the executioners of their friends and brethren, or to fall themſelves by their hands.</p>

                        <p>"IN every ſtage of theſe oppreſſions we have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned for redreſs in the moſt humble terms: Our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated

petitions have been anſwered only by repeated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury. A prince, whoſe character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.</p>
                        <p>"Nor have we been wanting in attentions to our Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh brethren. We have warned them, from time to time, of attempts by their legiſlature to extend an unwarrantable juriſdiction over us. We have reminded them of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of our emigration and ſettlement here. We have appealed to their native juſtice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to diſavow theſe uſurpations, which would inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably interrupt our connexions and correſpondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of juſtice and of conſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. We muſt, therefore, acquieſce in the neceſſity, which denounces our ſeparation, and hold them, as we hold the reſt of mankind, enemies in war, in peace friends.</p>
                        <p>"We, therefore, the repreſentatives of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, in GENERAL CONGRESS aſſembled, appealing to the ſupreme judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name, and by authority of the good people of theſe colonies, ſolemnly publiſh and declare, That theſe United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, FREE AND INDEPENDENT STATES; that they are abſolved from all allegiance to the Britiſh crown, and that all political connexion between them and the ſtate of Great-Britain, is, and ought to be, totally diſſolved; and that as FREE AND INDEPENDENT STATES, they have full power to levy war, conclude peace, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract alliances, eſtabliſh commerce, and to do all other acts and things which INDEPENDENT STATES may of right do. And for the ſupport of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of DIVINE PROVIDENCE, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our ſacred honor."</p>
                        <p>THIS deciſive ſtep was taken in the face of the whole Britiſh force collected on our ſhores. From that moment every thing aſſumes a new appearance: The propoſitions and ſupplications for reconciliation, ſo haughtily rejected, were done away. The metaphyſical diſquiſitions about the
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:016625_0059_0F9D70566A0E24D0"/>
compatibility of colonial liberty and parliamentary au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in commercial ſuperintendency by acts of legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, to the effect of external, excluſively of the idea of internal, taxation:—Theſe, with all the jargon incident to them, were at an end. A ſingle clear point was put on the iſſue of the conteſt, whether we ſhould be conquered en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaved provinces, or free and independent States? And on this propoſition every man was in capacity to take his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided part.</p>
                        <p>UPON the 3d day of September, 1776, general Sulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van, who had been made priſoner by the enemy in the action of Long Iſland, delivered the following meſſage to Congreſs from lord Howe:</p>
                        <p>"That, though he could not at preſent treat with Congreſs as ſuch, yet he was very deſirous of having a conference with ſome of the members, whom he would conſider for the preſent only as private gentlemen, and meet them himſelf as ſuch, at ſuch place as they ſhould appoint:</p>
                        <p>"That he, in conjunction with general Howe, had full powers to compromiſe the diſpute between Great-Britain and America upon terms advantageous to both; the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of which delayed him near two months in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and prevented his arrival at this place before the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of independency took place:</p>
                        <p>"That he wiſhed a compact might be ſettled at this time, when no deciſive blow was ſtruck, and neither party could ſay that they were compelled to enter into ſuch agreement:</p>
                        <p>"That, in caſe Congreſs were diſpoſed to treat, many things, which they had not as yet aſked, might and ought to be granted them; and that, if upon the conference, they found any probable ground of an accommodation, the authority of Congreſs muſt be afterwards acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, otherwiſe the compact would not be complete."</p>
                        <p>ON the 5th of September the Congreſs came to the following reſolutions; <hi>to wit,</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>"RESOLVED, That general Sullivan be requeſted to
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:016625_0060_0F9D70572ACA1618"/>
inform lord Howe, that this Congreſs, being the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of the free and independent States of America, cannot with propriety ſend any of its members, to confer with his lordſhip in their private characters, but that ever deſirous of eſtabliſhing peace on reaſonable terms, they will ſend a committee of their body, to know whether he has any authority to treat with perſons authorized by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs for that purpoſe in behalf of America, and what that authority is, and to hear ſuch propoſitions as he ſhall think fit to make reſpecting the ſame:</p>
                        <p>"That the preſident be deſired to write to general Waſhington, and acquaint him, that it is the opinion of Congreſs, no propoſals for making peace between Great-Britain and the United States of America ought to be received or attended to, unleſs the ſame be made in writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and addreſſed to the repreſentatives of the ſaid ſtates in Congreſs, or perſons authorized by them: And if ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication be made to him by any of the commanders of the Britiſh forces on that ſubject, that he inform them, that theſe United States, who entered into the war only for the defence of their lives and liberties, will cheerfully agree to peace on reaſonable terms, whenever ſuch ſhall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to them in manner aforeſaid."</p>
                        <p>THE committee was appointed the next day, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the 17th made the following report,</p>
                        <p>"IN obedience to the orders of Congreſs, we have had a meeting with lord Howe. It was on Wedneſday laſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Staten-Iſland, oppoſite to Amboy, where his lordſhip received and entertained us with the utmoſt politeneſs.</p>
                        <p>"His lordſhip opened the converſation by acquainting us, that, tho' he could not treat with us as a committee of Congreſs, yet, as his powers enabled him to confer and conſult with any private gentlemen of influence in the colonies, on the means of reſtoring peace between the two countries, he was glad of this opportunity of conferring with us on that ſubject, if we thought ourſelves at liberty to enter into a conference with him in that character. We obſerved to his lordſhip, that, as our buſineſs was to hear, he might conſider us in what light he pleaſed, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to us any propoſitions he might be authoriſed to
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:016625_0061_0F9D7057EC1EAD80"/>
make for the purpoſe mentioned; but, that we could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider ourſelves in no other character than that in which we were placed by order of Congreſs. His lordſhip then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into a diſcourſe of a conſiderable length, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained no explicit propoſition of peace, except one, namely, That the colonies ſhould return to their allegiance and obedience to the government of Great-Britain. The reſt conſiſted principally of aſſurances, that there was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding good diſpoſition in the king and his miniſters to make that government eaſy to us, with intimations, that, in caſe of our ſubmiſſion, they would cauſe the offenſive acts of parliament to be reviſed, and the inſtructions to governors to be reconſidered; that ſo, if any juſt cauſes of complaint were found in the acts, or any errors in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were perceived to have crept into the inſtructions, they might be amended or withdrawn.</p>
                        <p>"WE gave it as our opinion to his lordſhip, that a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the domination of Great-Britain was not now to be expected. We mentioned the repeated humble petitions of the colonies to the king and parliament, which had been treated with contempt and anſwered only by additional in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries; the unexampled patience we had ſhewn under their tyrannical government, and that it was not till the late act of parliament, which denounced war againſt us, and put us out of the king's protection, that we declared our Independence; that this declaration had been called for by the people of the colonies in general; that every colony had approved of it, when made, and all now conſidered themſelves as Independent States, and were ſettling or had ſettled their governments accordingly; ſo that it was not in the power of Congreſs to agree for them, that they ſhould return to their former dependent ſtate; that there was no doubt of their inclination to peace, and their wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to enter into a treaty with Britain, that might be advantageous to both countries; that, though his lordſhip had at preſent no power to treat with them as Independent States, he might, if there was the ſame good diſpoſition in Britain, much ſooner obtain freſh powers from thence, for that purpoſe, than powers could be obtained by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, from the ſeveral colonies, to conſent to a ſubmiſſion.</p>
                        <p>"His lordſhip then ſaying, that he was ſorry to find,
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:016625_0062_0F9D7058AD2BCC08"/>
that no accomodation was like to take place, put an end to the conference.</p>
                        <p>"Upon the whole, it did not appear to your commitee, that his lordſhip's commiſſion contained any other autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity than that expreſſed in the act of parliament, namely, that of granting pardons, with ſuch exceptions as the commiſſioners ſhall think proper to make, and of declaring America, or any part of it, to be in the king's peace, upon ſubmiſſion: For, as to the power of enquiring into the ſtate of America, which his lordſhip mentioned to us, and of conferring and conſulting with any perſons the commiſſioners might think proper, and repreſenting the reſult of ſuch converſation to the miniſtry, who provided the colonies would ſubject themſelves, might after all or might not, at their pleaſure, make any alterations in the former inſtructions to governors, or propoſe in parliament any amendment of the acts complained of, we apprehended any expectation from the effect of ſuch a power would have been too uncertain and precarious to be relied on by Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, had ſhe ſtill continued in her ſtate of dependence."</p>
                        <p>FROM this moment the war raged with the utmoſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and was proſecuted by the enemy with unabated vigor and barbarity. To recite the numerous inſtances in which their faith, ſolemnly pledged, hath been broken, would be tedious and perhaps uſeleſs: Victory declared herſelf for a long time in favor of their ſuperior numbers and ſuperior diſcipline, and their inſolence was equal to their ſucceſs. Unable to comprehend the whole of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject they had undertaken, and overjoyed at the acquiſition of the minuter parts, already the needy greedy paraſites of a voluptuous court had in imagination carved out our poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions among them, and wantoned in the proſpect of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the fruits of our laborious induſtry. Every thing therefore, which looked like conciliation, was treated as a conceſſion flowing from feebleneſs of ſoul. The ſpirit of deſpotiſm, fluſhed with hope and inured to guilt, turned a hard unfeeling eye upon the miſeries of human nature, and directed, well pleas'd, the ſtorm of vengeance to the head of freedom. But that full tide of ſucceſs, which had carried their expectations ſo high, began to ebb away: The gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant army commanded by Burgoyne, checked by impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:016625_0063_0F9D70596AF0C088"/>
which nature had thrown in his courſe, at length ſubmitted, notwithſtanding the efforts of their accompliſhed general, to the determined bravery of their foes. The ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of our ſucceſs in that quarter called the attention of Europe to our fortitude and perſeverance. The weight and importance of a country which could reſiſt the aſtoniſhing efforts made by Great-Britain, were evident to the moſt careleſs obſervation. The acknowledgement of our inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence became therefore an object of ſerious deliberation. Awakened from their dream of glory to a view of their danger, the miniſtry of England determined, if poſſible, to recover what they had wantonly thrown away.</p>

            <p>THIS was referred to a committee, who, on the 22d of April, made the following report;</p>
            <p>"THE Committee to whom was referred the general's letter of the 18th, containing a certain printed paper ſent from Philadelphia, purporting to be the draught of a Bill for declaring the <hi>intentions</hi> of the Parliament of Great-Britain, as to the <hi>exerciſe</hi> of what they are pleaſed to term their <hi>right</hi> of impoſing taxes within theſe United States; and alſo the draught of a Bill to enable the King of Great-Britain to appoint Commiſſioners, with powers to treat, conſult and agree upon the means of quieting certain diſorders within the ſaid States, beg leave to obſerve,</p>
            <p>"THAT the ſaid paper being induſtriouſly circulated by emiſſaries of the enemy, in a partial and ſecret man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the ſame ought to be forthwith printed for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blic information.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="unknown:016625_0068_0F9D705E5B831358"/>"THE Committee cannot aſcertain whether the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the ſaid paper have been framed in Philadelphia, or in Great-Britain, much leſs whether the ſame are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and truly intended to be brought into the Parliament of that kingdom, or whether the ſaid Parliament will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer thereon the uſual ſolemnities of their laws. But are inclined to believe this will happen, for the following reaſons:</p>
            <p n="1">"1ſt. BECAUSE their General hath made divers feeble efforts to ſet on foot ſome kind of treaty during the laſt winter, though, either from a miſtaken idea of his own dignity and importance, the want of information, or ſome other cauſe, he hath not made application to thoſe who are inveſted with a proper authority.</p>
            <p n="2">"2dly. BECAUSE they ſuppoſe that the fallacious idea of a ceſſation of hoſtilities will render theſe States remiſs in their preparations for war.</p>
            <p n="3">"3dly. BECAUSE believing the Americans wearied with war, they ſuppoſe we will accede to their terms for the ſake of peace.</p>
            <p n="4">"4thly. BECAUSE they ſuppoſe that our negociations may be ſubject to a like corrupt influence with their debates.</p>
            <p n="5">"5thly. BECAUSE they expect from this ſtep the ſame effects they did from what one of their miniſters thought proper to call his <hi>conciliatory motion,</hi> viz. that it will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent foreign powers from giving aid to theſe States; that it will lead their own ſubjects to continue a little longer the preſent war; and that it will detach ſome weak men in America from the cauſe of freedom and virtue.</p>
            <p n="6">"6thly. BECAUSE their King, from his own ſhewing, hath reaſon to apprehend that his fleets and armies, inſtead of being employed againſt the territories of theſe States, will be neceſſary for the defence of his own dominions. And</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="68" facs="unknown:016625_0069_0F9D705EACFCE438"/>"7thly. BECAUSE the impracticability of ſubjugating this country being every day more and more manifeſt, it is their intereſt to extricate themſelves from the war upon any terms.</p>
            <p>"THE Committee beg leave further to obſerve, That, upon a ſuppoſition the matters contained in the ſaid paper will really go into the Britiſh Statute Book, they ſerve to ſhew, in a clear point of view, the weakneſs and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the enemy.</p>
            <p>"THEIR WEAKNESS,</p>
            <p n="1">"1ſt. BECAUSE they formerly declared, not only that they had a right to bind the inhabitants of theſe States in all caſes whatſoever, but alſo that the ſaid inhabitants ſhould <hi>abſolutely</hi> and <hi>unconditionally</hi> ſubmit to the exerciſe of that right. And this ſubmiſſion they have endeavoured to exact by the ſword. Receding from this claim, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, under the preſent circumſtances, ſhews their inability to enforce it.</p>
            <p n="2">"2dly. BECAUSE their Prince hath heretofore rejected the humbleſt petitions of the Repreſentatives of America, praying to be conſidered as ſubjects, and protected in the enjoyment of peace, liberty and ſafety; and hath waged a moſt cruel war againſt them, and employed the ſavages to butcher innocent women and children. But now the ſame Prince pretends to treat with thoſe very Repreſentatives, and grant to the <hi>arms</hi> of America what he refuſed to her <hi>prayers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">"3dly. BECAUSE they have uniformly labored to conquer this continent, rejecting every idea of accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation propoſed to them, from a confidence in their own ſtrength. Wherefore it is evident, from the change in their mode of attack, that they have loſt this confidence. And</p>
            <p n="4">"4thly. BECAUSE the conſtant language, ſpoken not only by their Miniſters, but by the moſt public and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic acts of the nation, hath been, that it is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with their dignity to treat with the Americans while
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:016625_0070_0F9D705F6B33EBD8"/>
they have arms in their hands. Notwithſtanding which, an offer is now about to be made for treaty.</p>
            <p>"THE WICKEDNESS and INSINCERITY of the enemy appear from the following conſiderations:</p>
            <p n="1">"1ſt. EITHER the <hi>Bills</hi> now to be paſſed contain a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect or indirect ceſſion of a part of their former claims, or they do not. If they do, then it is acknowledged that they have ſacrificed many brave men in an unjuſt quarrel. If they no not, then they are calculated to deceive America into terms, to which neither argument before the war, nor force ſince, could procure her aſſent.</p>
            <p n="2">"2dly. THE firſt of theſe <hi>Bills</hi> appears, from the title, to be a declaration of the <hi>intentions</hi> of the Britiſh Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning the exerciſe of the <hi>right of impoſing taxes</hi> within theſe States. Wherefore, ſhould theſe States treat under the ſaid Bill, they would indirectly <hi>acknowledge</hi> that right, to obtain which acknowledgment the preſent war hath been avowedly undertaken and proſecuted on the part of Great-Britain.</p>
            <p n="3">"3dly. SHOULD ſuch pretended right be ſo acquieſced in, then, of conſequence, the ſame might be exerciſed whenever the Britiſh Parliament ſhould find themſelves in a different <hi>temper</hi> and <hi>diſpoſition;</hi> ſince it muſt depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe, and ſuch like contingencies, how far men will act according to their former <hi>intentions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">"4thly. THE ſaid firſt Bill, in the body thereof, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth no new matter, but is preciſely the ſame with the motion before-mentioned, and liable to all the objections which lay againſt the ſaid motion, excepting the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing particular, viz. that <hi>by the motion</hi> actual taxation was to be ſuſpended, ſo long as America ſhould give as much as the ſaid Parliament might think proper: Whereas, <hi>by the propoſed Bill,</hi> it is to be ſuſpended, as long as future Parliaments continue of the ſame mind with the preſent.</p>
            <p n="5">"5thly. FROM the ſecond Bill it appears, that the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh King may, if he pleaſes, appoint Commiſſioners to
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:016625_0071_0F9D706029D71AF8"/>
               <hi>treat</hi> and <hi>agree</hi> with thoſe, whom they pleaſe, about a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of things therein mentioned. But ſuch treaties and agreements are to be of no validity without the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the ſaid Parliament, except ſo far as they relate to the <hi>ſuſpenſion</hi> of hoſtilities, and of certain of their Acts, the granting of pardons, and the appointing of Governors to theſe ſovereign, free and independent States. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the ſaid Parliament have reſerved to themſelves, in <hi>expreſs words,</hi> the power of ſetting aſide any ſuch treaty, and taking the advantage of any circumſtances which may ariſe to ſubject this continent to their uſurpations.</p>
            <p n="6">"6thly. THE ſaid Bill, by holding forth a tender of pardon, implies a criminality in our juſtifiable reſiſtance, and conſequently, to treat under it would be an implied ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment that the inhabitants of theſe States were, what Britain hath declared them to be, <hi>Rebels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">"7thly. THE inhabitants of theſe States being claimed by them as Subjects, they may infer, from the nature of the negociation now pretended to be ſet on foot, that the ſaid inhabitants would of right be afterwards bound by ſuch laws as they ſhould make. Wherefore any agreement entered into on ſuch negociation might at any future time be repealed. And</p>
            <p n="8">"8thly. BECAUSE the ſaid Bill purports, that the Commiſſioners therein mentioned may treat with private individuals; a meaſure highly derogatory to the dignity of national character.</p>
            <p>"FROM all which it appears evident to your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, that the ſaid Bills are intended to operate upon the hopes and fears of the good people of theſe States, ſo as to create diviſions among them, and a defection from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cauſe, now by the bleſſing of Divine Providence draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near to a favourable iſſue. That they are the ſequel of that inſidious plan, which, from the days of the Stamp-act down to the preſent time, hath involved this country in contention and bloodſhed. And that, as in other caſes ſo in this, although circumſtances may force them at times to recede from their unjuſtifiable claims, there can be no
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:016625_0072_0F9D7060EA3B7A48"/>
doubt but they will as heretofore, upon the firſt favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able occaſion, again diſplay that luſt of domination, which hath rent in twain the mighty empire of Britain.</p>
            <p>"UPON the whole matter, the Committee beg leave to report it as their opinion, that as the Americans united in this arduous conteſt upon principles of common intereſt, for the defence of common rights and privileges, which union hath been cemented by common calamities and by mutual good offices and affection, ſo the great cauſe for which they contend, and in which all mankind are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted, muſt derive its ſucceſs from the continuance of that union. Wherefore any man or body of men, who ſhould preſume to make any ſeparate or partial convention or agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with Commiſſioners under the crown of Great-Britain, or any of them, ought to be conſidered and treated as open and avowed enemies of theſe United States.</p>
            <p>"AND further your Committee beg leave to report it as their opinion, That theſe United States cannot, with propriety, hold any conference or treaty with <hi>any</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners on the part of Great-Britain, unleſs they ſhall, as a preliminary thereto, either withdraw their fleets and armies, or elſe, in poſitive and expreſs terms, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Independence of the ſaid States.</p>
            <p>"AND inaſmuch as it appears to be the deſign of the enemies of theſe States to lull them into a fatal ſecurity— to the end that they may act with a becoming weight and importance, it is the opinion of your Committee, That the ſeveral States be called upon to uſe the moſt ſtrenuous exertions to have their reſpective quotas of continental troops in the field as ſoon as poſſible, and that all the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia of the ſaid States be held in readineſs, to act as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion may require."</p>
            <p>THIS report being read, and debated by paragraphs, was agreed to unanimouſly, and publiſhed.</p>
            <p>ON the next day Congreſs came to the following reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution:</p>

            <p>"RESOLVED, That it be recommended to the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the ſeveral ſtates to paſs laws, or to the executive authority of each ſtate, if inveſted with ſufficient power, to iſſue proclamations offering pardon, with ſuch excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and under ſuch limitations and reſtrictions as the ſeveral ſtates ſhall think expedient, to ſuch of their inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants or ſubjects who have levied war againſt any of theſe ſtates, or who have adhered to, aided or abetted the enemy, and who ſhall ſurrender themſelves to any civil or military officer of any of theſe ſtates, and ſhall return to the ſtate to which they may belong before the 10th day of June next: and it is recommended to the good and faithful ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens of theſe ſtates to receive ſuch returning penitents with compaſſion and mercy, and to forgive and bury in oblivion their paſt failings and tranſgreſſions."</p>

Every effort was vain. For, even whilſt we were proſtrated at the foot of the throne, that fatal blow was ſtruck, which hath ſeparated us for ever. Thus ſpurned, contemned, and inſulted—thus driven by our enemies into meaſures which our ſouls ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred—we made a ſolemn appeal to the tribunal of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring wiſdom and juſtice—to that Almighty ruler of princes whoſe kingdom is over all.</p>
                        <p>"WE were then quite defenceleſs. Without arms, without ammunition, without clothing, without ſhips, without money, without officers ſkilled in war; with no other reliance but the bravery of our people and the juſtice of our cauſe. We had to contend with a nation great in arts and in arms, whoſe fleets covered the ocean, whoſe banners had waved in triumph thro' every quarter of the globe. However unequal this conteſt, our weakneſs was ſtill farther increaſed by the enemies which America had nouriſhed in her boſom. Thus expoſed, on the one hand, to external force and internal diviſions; on the other, to be compelled to drink of the bitter cup of ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and to go ſorrowing all our lives long; in this ſad alternative, we choſe the former. To this alternative we were reduced by men, who, had they been animated by one ſpark of generoſity, would have diſdained to take ſuch mean advantage of our ſituation; or, had they paid the leaſt regard to the rules of juſtice, would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered with abhorrence a propoſition to injure thoſe who had faithfully fought their battles, and induſtriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to rear the edifice of their glory.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="74" facs="unknown:016625_0075_0F9D70632A1210B8"/>"BUT, however great the injuſtice of our foes in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencing this war, it is by no means equal to the cruelty with which they have conducted it. The courſe of their armies is marked by rapine and devaſtation. Thouſands, without diſtinction of age or ſex, have been driven from their peaceful abodes, to encounter the rigors of incle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeaſons; and the face of Heaven hath been inſulted by the wanton conflagration of defenceleſs towns. Their victories have been followed by the cool murder of men no longer able to reſiſt; and thoſe who eſcaped from the firſt act of carnage have been expoſed, by cold, hunger, and nakedneſs, to wear out a miſerable exiſtence in the tedious hours of confinement, or to become the deſtroyers of their countrymen, of their friends, perhaps, dreadful idea! of their parents or children. Nor was this the outrageous barbarity of an individual, but a ſyſtem of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate malice, ſtamped with the concurrence of the Britiſh legiſlature, and ſanctioned with all the formalities of law. Nay, determined to diſſolve the cloſeſt bonds of ſociety, they have ſtimulated ſervants to ſlay their maſters in the peaceful hour of domeſtic ſecurity. And, as if all this were inſufficient to ſlake their thirſt of blood, the blood of brothers, of unoffending brothers, they have excited the Indians againſt us; and a general, who calls himſelf a chriſtian, a follower of the merciful Jeſus, hath dared to proclaim to all the world his intention of letting looſe againſt us whole hoſts of ſavages, whoſe rule of warfare is promiſcuous carnage, who rejoice to murder the infant ſmiling in its mother's arms, to inflict on their priſoners the moſt excruciating torments, and exhibit ſcenes of horror from which nature recoils.</p>
                        <p>"WERE it poſſible, they would have added to this terrible ſyſtem, for they have offered the inhabitants of theſe ſtates to be exported by their merchants to the ſickly, baneful climes of India, there to periſh. An offer not accepted of, merely from the impracticability of carrying it into execution.</p>
                        <p>"NOTWITHSTANDING theſe great provocations, we have treated ſuch of them as fell into our hands with tenderneſs, and ſtudiouſly endeavoured to alleviate the
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:016625_0076_0F9D7063F85C63F8"/>
afflictions of their captivity. This conduct we have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued ſo far, as to be by them ſtigmatized with cowardice, and by our friends with folly. But our dependence was not upon man. It was upon Him who hath commanded us to love our enemies, and to render good for evil. And what can be more wonderful than the manner of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances? How often have we been reduced to diſtreſs, and yet been raiſed up? When the means to proſecute the war have been wanting to us, have not our foes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves been rendered inſtrumental in providing them? This hath been done in ſuch a variety of inſtances, ſo peculiarly marked almoſt by the direct interpoſition of Providence, that not to feel and acknowledge his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, would be the height of impious ingratitude.</p>
                        <p>"AT length that God of battles, in whom was our truſt, hath conducted us through the paths of danger and diſtreſs to the threſholds of ſecurity. It hath now become morally certain, that, if we have courage to perſevere, we ſhall eſtabliſh our liberties and independence.—The haughty prince, who ſpurned us from his feet with contumely and diſdain,—and the parliament which proſcribed us, now deſcend to offer terms of accommodation. Whilſt in the full career of victory, they pulled off the maſk, and avowed their intended deſpotiſm: But, having laviſhed in vain the blood and treaſure of their ſubjects in purſuit of this exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable purpoſe, they now endeavour to enſnare us with the inſidious offers of peace. They would ſeduce you into a dependence, which neceſſarily, inevitably leads to the moſt humiliating ſlavery. And do they believe that you will accept theſe fatal terms? Becauſe you have ſuffered the diſtreſſes of war, do they ſuppoſe that you will baſely lick the duſt before the feet of your deſtroyers? Can there be an American ſo loſt to the feelings which adorn human nature? To the generous pride, the elevation, the dignity of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom? Is there a man who would not abhor a dependence upon thoſe who have deluged his country in the blood of its inhabitants? We cannot ſuppoſe this; neither is it poſſible that they themſelves can expect to make many converts. What then is their intention? Is it not to lull you with the fallacious hopes of peace, until they can aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble new armies to proſecute their nefarious deſigns?
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:016625_0077_0F9D7064AA3392D8"/>
If this is not the caſe, why do they ſtrain every nerve to levy men throughout their iſlands? Why do they meanly court each little tyrant of Europe to ſell them his unhappy ſlaves? Why do they continue to embitter the minds of the Savages againſt you? Surely this is not the way to conciliate the affections of America. Be not, therefore, deceived. You have ſtill to expect one ſevere conflict. Your foreign alliances, though they ſecure your inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, cannot ſecure your country from deſolation, your habitations from plunder, your wives from inſult or violation, nor your children from butchery. Foiled in their principal deſign, you muſt expect to feel the rage of diſappointed ambition. Ariſe then! To your tents! And gird you for the battle! It is time to turn the headlong current of vengeance upon the head of the deſtroyer. They have filled up the meaſure of their abominations, and like ripe fruit muſt ſoon drop from the tree. Altho' much is done, yet much remains to do. Expect not peace, whilſt any corner of America is in poſſeſſion of your foes. You muſt drive them away from this land of promiſe, a land flowing indeed with milk and honey. Your brethren at the extremities of the continent already implore your friendſhip and protection. It is your duty to grant their requeſt. They hunger and thirſt after liberty. Be it yours to diſpenſe to them the heavenly gift. And what is there now to prevent it?</p>
                        <p>"AFTER the unremitted efforts of our enemies, we are ſtronger than before. Nor can the wicked emiſſaries, who ſo aſſiduouſly labor to promote their cauſe, point out any one reaſon to ſuppoſe that we ſhall not receive daily acceſſions of ſtrength. They tell you, it is true, that your money is of no value; and your debts ſo enormous they can never be paid. But we tell you, that if Britain proſecutes the war another campaign, that ſingle cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign will coſt her more than we have hitherto expanded. And yet theſe men would prevail upon you to take up that immenſe load, and for it to ſacrifice your deareſt rights. For, ſurely, there is no man ſo abſurd as to ſuppoſe, that the leaſt ſhadow of liberty can be preſerved in a dependent connexion with Great-Britain. From the nature of the thing it is evident, that the only ſecurity you could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:016625_0078_0F9D70657A328F40"/>
would be the juſtice and moderation of a parliament who have ſold the rights of their own conſtituents. And this ſlender ſecurity is ſtill farther weakened, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration that it was pledged to rebels, (as they unjuſtly call the good people of theſe ſtates) with whom they think they are not bound to keep faith by any law whatſoever. Thus would you be caſt bound among men, whoſe minds (by your virtuous reſiſtence) have been ſharpened to the keeneſt edge of revenge. Thus would your children, and your childrens children, be, by you, forced to a partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation in all their debts, their wars, their luxuries and their crimes. And this mad, this impious ſyſtem they would lead you to adopt, becauſe of the derangement of your finances.</p>
                        <p>"IT becomes you deeply to reflect on this ſubject. Is there a country on earth, which hath ſuch reſources for the payment of her debts as America? Such an extenſive territory? So fertile, ſo bleſſed in its climate and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions? Surely there is none. Neither is there any to which the wiſe Europeans will ſooner confide their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty. What then are the reaſons that your money hath depreciated? Becauſe no taxes have been impoſed to carry on the war. Becauſe your commerce hath been inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by your enemy's fleets. Becauſe their armies have ravaged and deſolated a part of your country, Becauſe their agents have villainouſly counterfeited your bills. Becauſe extortioners among you, inflamed with the luſt of gain, have added to the price of every article of life. And becauſe weak men have been artfully led to believe that it is of no value. How is this dangerous diſeaſe to be remedied? Let thoſe among you, who have leiſure and opportunity, collect the monies which individuals in their neighbourhood are deſirous of placing in the public funds. Let the ſeveral legiſlatures ſink their reſpective emiſſions, that ſo, there being but one kind of bills, there may be leſs danger of counterfeits. Refrain a little while from purchaſing thoſe things which are not abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, that ſo thoſe who have engroſſed commodities may ſuffer (as they deſervedly will) the loſs of their ill-gotten hoards, by reaſon of the commerce with foreign nations, which their fleets will protect. Above all, bring forward
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:016625_0079_0F9D70675331BDF8"/>
your armies into the field. Truſt not to appearances of peace or ſafety. Be aſſured that, unleſs you perſevere, you will be expoſed to every ſpecies of barbarity. But if you exert the means of defence which God and nature have given you, the time will ſoon arrive when every man ſhall ſit under his own vine and under his own fig-tree, and there ſhall be none to make him afraid.</p>
                        <p>"THE ſweets of a free commerce with every part of the earth will ſoon reimburſe you for all the loſſes you have ſuſtained. The full tide of wealth will flow in upon your ſhores, free from the arbitrary impoſitions of thoſe whoſe intereſt and whoſe declared policy it was to check your growth. Your intereſts will be foſtered and nouriſhed by governments that derive their power from your grant, and will therefore be obliged, by the influence of cogent neceſſity, to exert it in your favor.</p>
                        <p>"IT is to obtain theſe things that we call for your ſtrenuous, unremitted exertions. Yet do not believe that you have been or can be ſaved merely by your own ſtrength. No! It is by the aſſiſtance of Heaven, and this you muſt aſſiduouſly cultivate by acts which Heaven ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves. Thus ſhall the power and the happineſs of theſe ſovereign, free and independent States, founded on the virtue of their citizens, increaſe, extend and endure, until the Almighty ſhall blot out all the empires of the earth."</p>

                  <p>"WITH an earneſt deſire to ſtop the further ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of blood and the calamities of war, we communicate to you, with the leaſt poſſible delay after our arrival in this city, a copy of the commiſſion with which his Majeſty is pleaſed to honor us, as alſo the acts of Parliament on which it is founded. And, at the ſame time that we aſſure you of our moſt earneſt deſire to re-eſtabliſh, on the baſis of equal freedom and mutual ſafety, the tranquillity of this once happy empire, you will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that we are veſted with powers equal to the purpoſe, and ſuch as are even unprecedented in the annals of our hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>"IN the preſent ſtate of our affairs, though fraught with ſubjects of mutual regret, all parties may draw ſome degree of conſolation, and even auſpicious hope, from the recollection that cordial reconciliation and affection have, in our own and other empires, ſucceeded to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions and temporary diviſions not leſs violent than thoſe we now experience.</p>
                  <p>"WE wiſh not to recall ſubjects which are now no longer in controverſy, and will reſerve to a proper time of diſcuſſion, both the hopes of mutual benefit, and the conſideration of evils, that may naturally contribute to determine your reſolutions, as well as our own, on this important occaſion.</p>
                  <p>"THE acts of Parliament which we tranſmit to you having paſſed with ſingular unanimity, will ſufficiently evince the diſpoſition of Great-Britain, and ſhew that the
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:016625_0088_0F9D706DA9F950C8"/>
terms of agreement in contemplation with his Majeſty and with Parliament are ſuch as come up to every wiſh that North-America, either in the hour of temperate deliberation or of the utmoſt apprehenſion of danger to liberty, has expreſſed.</p>
                  <p>"MORE effectually to demonſtrate our good intentions, we think proper to declare, even in this our firſt commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, that we are diſpoſed to concur in every ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and juſt arrangement towards the following among other purpoſes:</p>
                  <p>"TO conſent to a ceſſation of hoſtilities, both by ſea and land.</p>
                  <p>"TO reſtore free intercourſe, to revive mutual affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and renew the common benefits of naturalization, through the ſeveral parts of this empire.</p>
                  <p>"TO extend every freedom to trade that our reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive intereſts can require.</p>
                  <p>"TO agree that no military forces ſhall be kept up in the different ſtates of North-America, without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the general Congreſs of particular Aſſemblies.</p>
                  <p>"TO concur in meaſures calculated to diſcharge the debts of America, and to raiſe the credit and value of the paper circulation.</p>
                  <p>"TO perpetuate our union by a reciprocal deputation of an agent or agents from the different States, who ſhall have the privilege of a ſeat and voice in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Great-Britain; or, if ſent from Britain, in that caſe to have a ſeat and voice in the Aſſemblies of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent States to which they may be deputed reſpectively, in order to attend the ſeveral intereſts of thoſe by whom they are deputed.</p>
                  <p>"IN ſhort, to eſtabliſh the power of the reſpective le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlatures in each particular State, to ſettle its revenue, its civil and military eſtabliſhment, and to exerciſe a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:016625_0089_0F9D706E694AB978"/>
freedom of legiſlation and internal government, ſo that the Britiſh States throughout North-America, acting with us in peace and war under one common ſovereign, may have the irrevocable enjoyment of every privilege, that is ſhort of a total ſeparation of intereſts, or conſiſtent with that union of force, on which the ſafety of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon religion and liberty depends.</p>
                  <p>"IN our anxiety for preſerving thoſe ſacred and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial intereſts, we cannot help taking notice of the inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious interpoſition of a power, which has, from the firſt ſettlement of theſe colonies, been actuated with enmity to us both. And notwithſtanding the pretended date or preſent form of the French offers to North-America, yet it is notorious that theſe were made in conſequence of the plans of accommodation previouſly concerted in Great-Britain, and with a view to prevent our reconciliation, and to prolong this deſtructive war.</p>
                  <p>"BUT we truſt that the inhabitants of North-America, connected with us by the neareſt ties of conſanguinity, ſpeaking the ſame language, intereſted in the preſervation of ſimilar inſtitutions, remembering the former happy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe of good offices, and forgetting recent animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, will ſhrink from the thought of becoming an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of force to our late mutual enemy, and will prefer a firm, a free and perpetual coalition with the parent ſtate, to an inſincere and unnatural foreign alliance.</p>
                  <p>"THIS diſpatch will be delivered to you by Doctor Ferguſon, the Secretary to his Majeſty's Commiſſion. And for further explanation and diſcuſſion of every ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of difference, we deſire to meet with you, either col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectively or by deputation, at New-York, Philadelphia, York-Town, or ſuch other place as you may propoſe. We think it right, however to apprize you, that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's inſtructions, as well as our own deſire to remove from the immediate ſeat of war, in the active operations of which we cannot take any part, may induce us ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to remove to New-York: But the Commander in Chief of his Majeſty's land forces, who is joined with us in this commiſſion, will, if it ſhould become eligible, either

concur with us in a ſuſpenſion of hoſtilities, or will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh all neceſſary paſſports and ſafe conduct to facilitate our meeting, and we ſhall of courſe expect the ſame of you.</p>
                  <p>"IF, after the time that may be neceſſary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this communication and tranſmit your anſwer, the horrors and devaſtations of war ſhould continue, we call God and the world to witneſs, that the evils which muſt follow, are not to be imputed to Great-Britain: And we cannot, without the moſt real ſorrow, anticipate the proſpect of calamities, which we feel the moſt ardent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to prevent.

might or could have exerciſed, in as full and ample man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and form as if ſuch Governor and Commander in Chief had been nominated and appointed by our letters patent or commiſſion; and for that purpoſe, if need be, to revoke, annul and make void any commiſſion or letters patent heretofore granted, for appointing any ſuch Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor and Commander in Chief. Whereas, by certain letters patent under our great ſeal, bearing date on the 29th day of April, in the 16th year of our reign, we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted and appointed you, the ſaid Sir William Howe, to be General and Commander in Chief of all and ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar our forces employed, or to be employed, within our colonies in North-America, lying upon the Atlantic ocean, from Nova-Scotia on the north, to Weſt-Florida on the ſouth, both incluſive, to have, hold, exerciſe and enjoy the ſaid office during our will and pleaſure; and in caſe you, the ſaid Sir Willam Howe, ſhould, by death or any other manner, be diſabled from exerciſing the ſaid command, it was our will and pleaſure, therein expreſſed, that the ſame, with all authorities, rights and privileges, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in that our ſaid commiſſion, ſhould devolve on ſuch officer, bearing our commiſſion, as ſhould be next in rank to you, the ſaid Sir William Howe. And whereas our truſty and well-beloved Sir Henry Clinton, Knight of the moſt honorable Order of the Bath, Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant General of our forces, and General of our forces in our army in America only, now actually bears our commiſſion, and is next in rank to you, the ſaid Sir William Howe: Know it is our further will and pleaſure, and we do hereby ordain and appoint, that whenever the ſaid command in the ſaid letters patent mentioned ſhall, in purſuance thereof, devolve upon the ſaid Sir Henry Clin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, all and every the powers and authorities hereby en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>truſted and committed to you, the ſaid Sir William Howe, ſhall forthwith ceaſe and determine, and the ſaid powers and authorities, and every of them, ſhall from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth be entruſted and committed, and are hereby entruſted and committed to the ſaid Sir Henry Clinton, to uſe and exerciſe the ſame powers and authorities, and to perform and execute all other the matters and things as aforeſaid, in as full and ample extent and form, and no other, as you, the ſaid Sir William Howe, are hereby authoriſed to uſe

and exerciſe, do, perform and execute the ſame.

            <p>ON this occaſion it is to be obſerved, that a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance had intervened between the reſolutions of the 22d of April and the receipt of the letter from the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners. This was the arrival of the copies of treaties en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into with his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, which was the firſt intelligence which had been received from Europe in the ſpace of a year. The reſolutions of the Houſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore on the 22d of April were founded ſimply on the firm determination under no change of fortune whatever to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede from the declaration of independence in July 1776, and for this reaſon, as a preliminary to any treaty, it was required that Great-Britain ſhould either acknowledge our independence or withdraw her fleets and armies, becauſe upon no other principle could America be ſaid to poſſeſs that degree of equality and freedom which is eſſential to the validity of national compacts. The treaty with France being out of the queſtion, had theſe preliminaries been complied with, we ſhould have been bound in honor, as
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:016625_0099_0F9D7077A3C516D8"/>
we certainly were by inclination and the principles of humanity, to enter upon a conference for the purpoſe of ſheathing the ſword <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> But ſince by that treaty the United States could not upon a certain contingency make either peace or truce without the conſent of her ally, it became neceſſary to provide that any treaties to be made ſhould not be inconſiſtent with treaties already ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting.</p>
            <p>AS to the conditions or terms offered by the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners it muſt be obſerved, that the firſt is <q>to extend every freedom to trade that our reſpective intereſts can require.</q> A propoſition which, from the very nature of things, is impracticable, or if practicable, is on their part a reaſon why reconciliation is unneceſſary; for certainly if theſe intereſts are compatible, they may be regulated by treaty, nay they would regulate themſelves. Individuals would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult their private intereſts, and national intereſt is nothing more than the aggregate of the particular advantages reſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſubjects of a ſtate from their private induſtry and diſcernment. But the intereſt of America requires that ſhe ſhould trade freely to every part of the earth, while on the other hand it is the intereſt of Great-Britain to confine our commerce to the ports of her own iſland. Nothing then could be more inſidious than this offer; for the independence of America being given up, the Britiſh parliament muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily have become ſupreme, at leaſt in matters which were heretofore conſidered as external to America. Of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence they alone would have been judges of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective intereſts, and in caſes where theſe were oppoſed, we may eaſily determine their judgment.</p>
            <p>THE next offer is, that <q>no military force ſhould be kept up in America without the conſent of Congreſs or the particular Aſſemblies.</q> To which every objection lies: For, 1ſt. ſuppoſing them to abide literally by ſuch agreement, we lay open to all the arts of ſeduction, which long and ſucceſsful practice could teach them to make uſe of againſt both the one and the other. 2dly. On any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, which either the exiſtence or apprehenſion of a foreign war might give riſe to, this conſent would na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally flow from a regard to immediate ſafety, and be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:016625_0100_0F9D707A8AC50CB0"/>
uſed for our certain deſtruction. But, 3dly. on this, as well as every other propoſition they either did or could make, it is to be obſerved that in the firſt inſtance the parliament might diſſent immediately and take an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to cruſh all oppoſition, while we were at once diſarmed at home and diſgraced for our perfidy abroad. And, 4thly. Should the moment be ſo unfavorable, or they ſo honeſt as not to make the attempt, any future parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would be in legal capacity to diſannul an agreement whoſe validity was derived from the former ſanction of the ſame legiſlature; ſo that during all the poſſible events, which time might give birth to, we ſhould have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to their attempts, whilſt laboring under a weight of debt, and ſore from the wounds of our obſtinate conteſt.</p>
            <p>THE third offer is, <q>to concur in meaſures calculated to diſcharge the debts of America and to raiſe the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and value of the paper circulation.</q> On which it is to be obſerved, that as our debt conſiſted of this paper cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, ſo any meaſures to diſcharge it, that is to ſink a part, muſt raiſe the value of the remainder. Now for this purpoſe taxation was alone neceſſary, and indeed the only ſtep which either they or we could take for that purpoſe: Their generous offer therefore was nothing more than to concur in taxing us to pay our own debts. In return for this, however, we were to be united with them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently become ſecurity for payment of their debts, which are enormous. The following ſhort calculation is worthy of attention: 120,000,000 of dollars, at ſeven ſhillings and ſix-pence per dollar, is £45,000,000, and exchange being at 1000 per cent, which is the preſent rate, this ſum is worth £4,500,000 ſterling only. But at all events the preſent debt of America ought not to be eſtimated at above £10,000,000 ſterling.</p>
            <p>THEIR offer then ſtands thus, if you will ſtand ſecurity for and eventually pay your part of £150,000,000 ſterling which we owe, we will conſent to your taxing yourſelves to pay £10,000,000 ſterling, which you owe. To com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on an offer of this kind would be abſurd.</p>
            <p>THE fourth offer is, <q>to perpetuate our union by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:016625_0101_0F9D707B2B6901B0"/>
deputation of an agent or agents from the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſtates, who ſhall have the privilege of a ſeat and voice in the parliament of Great-Britain, or if ſent from Britain, in that caſe to have a ſeat and voice in the aſſemblies of the different ſtates, to which they may be deputed reſpectively, in order to attend to the ſeveral intereſts of thoſe by whom they are deputed.</q> Or, in other words, to perpetuate our ſlavery, by taking from us, on the one hand, the objection againſt their tyrannous acts, that we were not repreſented in the legiſlature which paſſed them, though in fact ſuch repreſentation would be merely illuſory and ineffectual. And on the other, by ſending mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial agents, artful, plauſible and wicked, to influence the debates of our legiſlatures, and give a voice among the immediate repreſentatives of the people on matters even of the moſt internal nature. No greater inſult was ever of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to the common ſenſe of mankind. Had the propoſal, particularly the latter part of it, been made before the commencement of the conteſt, it was ſufficient in itſelf to have rouſed us to arms. If accepted and executed, in all the ſtates it muſt have been pernicious, but in thoſe called royal governments, would have ſtood thus: A legiſlature conſiſting of three branches, 1ſt. A governor appointed by the king during pleaſure. 2dly. A council appointed by the king during pleaſure. 3dly. An aſſembly partly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the king and partly by the people, but all hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſeats during the king's pleaſure—The laws paſſed by this legiſlature to be of no validity without the king's conſent—A repreſentative to be appointed by this legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to ſit in a houſe of commons, conſiſting of more than five hundred members, and thereby to validate any law, which they might paſs to bind the people of that ſtate. If this be compared with <hi>"the freedom they profer to extend to trade,"</hi> ſome faint idea may be formed of the meditated ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>THE laſt offer is, <q>to eſtabliſh the power of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective legiſlatures in each particular ſtate, to ſettle its revenue, its civil and military eſtabliſhment, and to exerciſe a perfect freedom of legiſlation and internal go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, ſo that the Britiſh ſtates throughout North-America, acting with us in peace and war under one
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:016625_0102_0F9D707BE97D8D30"/>
common ſovereign, may have the irrevocable enjoyment of every privilege that is ſhort of a total ſeparation of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, or conſiſtent with that union of force on which the ſafety of our common religion and liberty depends.</q> The firſt part of this is ridiculous, ſince all the ſtates have taken ſome forms of government, the legiſlatures of which are obeyed, and conſequently their power eſtabliſhed already; the object therefore, taking it in compariſon with what goes before, is to overturn the free legiſlatures already eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, and in their ſtead to inſtitute the baſe and ſlaviſh mixture contained in the third offer. The ſecond part ſerves to ſhew more clearly (if poſſible) the inſidious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their commiſſion; for from this it appears, that the object of revenue is by no means given up, nor the deſign of keeping a military force in America relinquiſhed. The third part is nugatory, for having before marked out the kind of legiſlature to be eſtabliſhed, even the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained acts of it would not prove the freedom of the people, but rather their ſlavery, and yet it is clear that however free they might be to paſs laws, there would have been a ſuperior power in legal capacity to repeal them. From all this however they deduce, as a conſequence, that ſhould we accede to their propoſitions, <hi>we ſhould have the irrevocable enjoyment of every privilege that is ſhort of a total ſeparation of intereſts, or conſiſtent with that union of force,</hi> &amp;c. But this concluſion by no means follows from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; on the contrary it is evident, that we ſhould enjoy no one <hi>privilege,</hi> and have the <hi>irrevocable</hi> enjoyment of no one thing, unleſs it be ſuppoſed that to repent is to enjoy. For the ſake of this ſophiſtical ſyſtem however we were to covenant, that we would act with them in peace and in war. The conſequence of which would have been, that we muſt have contracted new debts, to promote their intereſted views, before we had paid the ſums expended for our own defence, and have laviſhed the beſt blood of America, to gratify the pride, pique, avarice, ambition, or revenge of a haughty deſpot, deaf to the prayers of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicative millions, and dead to the feelings of juſtice or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. One fact however they indirectly admit, that their ſafety depends upon an union of force with us. The neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary conſequence is, that, notwithſtanding their pretended ſuperiority, they muſt not only make peace with us, but
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:016625_0103_0F9D707CAA0389F8"/>
it muſt be on our own terms, provided the people of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica are ſenſible of their true intereſts, and the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of America have patience, firmneſs and diſcernment to take proper advantage of their own ſituation and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.</p>
            <p>THE conciſe anſwer which Congreſs had given to the Britiſh Commiſſioners, placed them in a very diſagreeable ſituation, and therefore it became neceſſary for them to make ſome efforts to get out of it. For this purpoſe they ſent a letter, dated at New-York, the 11th of July, 1778, which was received and read in Congreſs the 18th, in the following words:</p>

                  <p>"ONE is an explicit acknowledgment of the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of theſe States.

            <p>UPON which the Congreſs came to the following re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution:</p>
            <p>"WHEREAS Congreſs in a letter to the Britiſh Commiſſioners of the 17th of June laſt, did declare that they would be ready to enter upon the conſideration of a treaty of peace and commerce, not inconſiſtent with trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties already ſubſiſting, when the King of Great-Britain ſhould demonſtrate a ſincere diſpoſition for that purpoſe; and that the only ſolid proof of this diſpoſition, would be an explicit acknowledgement of the Independence of theſe States, or withdrawing his fleets and armies: And whereas, neither of theſe alternatives have been complied with, therefore.</p>
            <p>"RESOLVED, That no anſwer be given to the letter of the 11th inſtant from the Britiſh Commiſſioners."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="unknown:016625_0106_0F9D707EE984DC48"/>THE propoſal contained in the letter, to enlarge inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, is at the firſt bluſh abſurd:—Any ſtate, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence of which could be leſſened, is of conſequence not independent. The offer therefore is a mere jargon of words, and calculated, as indeed the whole letter appears, for the people, and particularly for thoſe whom they have thought proper to call our fellow-citizens of this conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, or, in other words, the traitors who have joined the common enemy. But one of their great objects was, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, to draw the Congreſs into ſome kind of treaty or correſpondence, in order that they might have where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal to give weight to the calumnies they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated, by declaring to the French court that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs were faithleſs, and indeed had actually bargained for the ſubjection of America, the price of which was to be paid by theſe Commiſſioners.</p>
            <p>IN conſiſtence with this plan, and, if poſſible, to obtain an indirect acknowledgment of their authority, they, on the 26th of Auguſt, 1778, made a requiſition of the troops of the convention of Saratoga, in the following terms:</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <head>By the Earl of <hi>CARLISLE,</hi> Sir <hi>HENRY CLIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON,</hi> and <hi>WILLIAM EDEN,</hi> 
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> three of his majeſty's commiſſioners, appointed with ſufficient powers to treat, conſult and agree upon the means of quieting the diſorders now ſubſiſting in certain of the colonies, plantations and provinces of North-America.</head>
                  <p>"UPON a repreſentation from the commander in chief of his majeſty's forces, that the troops lately ſerving under lieutenant-general Burgoyne, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſolemn convention entered into at Saratoga, in which it is ſtipulated that the ſaid troops ſhould have a free paſſage to Great-Britain, are nevertheleſs, under various pretences, ſtill detained in New-England—The following remonſtrance againſt the unjuſt detention of thoſe troops, and requiſition for their immediate releaſe, on the condition annexed to the article by which their paſſage to England is ſtipulated, are now ſolemnly made to the American Congreſs:</p>

                     <pb n="106" facs="unknown:016625_0107_0F9D707FA9BE8218"/>"WHEREAS the means that have been deviſed by mankind to mitigate the horrors of war, and to facilitate the re-eſtabliſhment of peace, depend on the faith of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels, military capitulations, conventions and treaties enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into even during the continuance of hoſtilities: From whence all nations have agreed to obſerve ſuch conventions, as they revere the ſacred obligations of humanity and juſtice, and as they would avoid the horrid practice of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliations, which, however juſtly due to the guilty, in ſuch caſes but too frequently fall on the innocent.</p>
                  <p>"AND whereas upon theſe conſiderations all breach of faith, even with an enemy, and all attempts to elude the force of military conventions, or to defeat their ſalutary purpoſes by evaſion or chicane, are juſtly held in deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and deemed unworthy of any deſcription of perſons aſſuming the character or ſtating themſelves as the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of nations.</p>
                  <p>"AND whereas it was ſtipulated in the ſecond article of the convention entered into at Saratoga between lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant-general Burgoyne and major-general Gates, <q>That a free paſſage be granted to the army under lieutenant-general Burgoyne to Great-Britain, upon condition of not ſerving again in North-America during the preſent conteſt; and the port of Boſton is aſſigned for the entry of tranſports, whenever general Howe ſhall ſo order:</q>

And the ſaid Commiſſioners, in order to remove every ſuppoſed difficulty or pretence for delay in the execution of this treaty, ariſing from any paſt, real, apparent or ſuppoſed infraction of it, by word or writing on the ſide of either party, hereby offer to renew, on the part of Great-Britain, all the ſtipulations of the ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, and particularly to ratify the condition annexed to the ſecond article thereof above recited, by which thoſe

            <p>AS theſe gentlemen did not appear with the proper let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of credence to an independent ſtate, Congreſs could not diſcuſs ſuch propoſitions without acknowledging in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly the authority of the commiſſion by which they were appointed; and in doing that they muſt have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the authority of thoſe acts of parliament on which that commiſſion was founded. But as an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent ſtate they could not take notice of perſons acting either under a commiſſion or an act of parliament, theſe being of a domeſtic nature, and relative to internal polity, but without authenticity as to foreign powers.</p>
            <p>THE Commiſſioners then, on the one hand, had no right to make the demand, as it was not contained in their commiſſion, and could not poſſibly have been in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation at the time of granting it: Beſides that, being in its nature purely military, it was the proper buſineſs of the Britiſh commander in chief. And, on the other hand, the Congreſs could not make a direct anſwer to it without receding from their right as repreſentatives of a ſovereign and independent people.</p>
            <p>BUT further: It being evident from the face of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, when compared with their commiſſion, that they offered what they had no power to perform, it follows that they deſigned to obtain the troops without giving the ſolid ſecurity which had been rightfully demanded for their performance of the convention. And from thence it is a
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:016625_0109_0F9D7082518F6838"/>
clear inference, that they deſigned totally to diſregard the convention whenever the troops ſhould be in their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion.</p>
            <p>THESE reaſons taken together, ought certainly to have prevented the Congreſs from taking any notice of <hi>their</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition. But one object of the commiſſioners was, to find ſome ground for a charge againſt the Congreſs of a want of national faith and honor; and on that and every other occaſion it was of importance that the people of America ſhould have materials to form a judgment of the conduct of their repreſentatives. On the 4th of September, therefore, a few days after the receipt of that, with ſome other papers, they came to the following reſolution:</p>
            <p>"WHEREAS Congreſs did, on the 8th day of January, 1778, reſolve, That the embarkation of lieutenant-general Burgoyne, and the troops under his command, be ſuſpended till a diſtinct and explicit ratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the convention of Saratoga ſhall be properly notified by the court of Great-Britain to Congreſs:</p>
            <p>"RESOLVED, That no ratification of the convention of Saratoga, which may be tendered in conſequence of powers which may reach that caſe by conſtruction and implica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or which may ſubject whatever is tranſacted relative to it, to the future approbation or diſapprobation of the parliament of Great-Britain, can be accepted by Congreſs."</p>
            <p>ON the 19th of September, 1778, the following letter was received by Congreſs:</p>

            <p>IT is worthy of remark, that this extract is dated at Whitehall, ſo early as the 12th of June, from whence to the 26th of Auguſt is 75 days; wherefore it is more than probable that it was received <hi>previous,</hi> and not <hi>ſubſequent,</hi>

to the requiſition made by the Commiſſioners. This cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance heightens the fraudulent complexion of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure; and in any caſe the extract ſhews the decided opinion of the Britiſh court, that their Commiſſioners had not the power by them pretended.</p>
            <p>BUT further: The Congreſs had reſolved on the 8th of January, 1778, on the moſt concluſive reaſons, <q>That the embarkation of lieutenant-general Burgoyne and the troops under his command be ſuſpended till <hi>a diſtinct and explicit ratification</hi> of the convention of Saratoga ſhall be properly notified by the court of Great-Britain to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs.</q> But inſtead of this, there is ſimply a <hi>direction</hi> of a ſecretary of ſtate to their general <q>to give the fulleſt <hi>aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances,</hi> &amp;c.</q> which aſſurances, and the general who gave them, or the very ſecretary himſelf, might be diſavowed. The perſon who certifies the extract alſo might eaſily be diſavowed; nay, it is very poſſible that no ſuch letter was ever written: Nor can we argue againſt ſuch deceit from the baſeneſs of it; for thoſe who would do the many treacherous acts which they had committed during the war, who had borrowed from felons of the moſt pitiful kind the little vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainy of counterfeiting money, and with whom it was a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorite maxim that no faith was to be kept with rebels, could hardly boggle at the ſending as an extract from a ſecretary of ſtate's letter what really was not ſuch an extract. But it is unneceſſary to dwell on theſe objections; for the laſt paragraph of Sir Henry Clinton's letter was ſo highly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent, that it would have been treaſon againſt the dignity of the people of America to have attended to it. The Congreſs, therefore, with great propriety, <q>ordered that the ſecretary return the following anſwer: Sir, I am directed to inform you, that the Congreſs of the United States of America make no anſwer to inſolent letters.</q>
            </p>

                        <p>"HAVING amply and repeatedly made known to the Congreſs, and having alſo proclaimed to the inhabitants of North-America in general, the benevolent overtures of Great-Britain towards a re-union and coalition with her colonies, we do not think it conſiſtent either with the duty we owe to our country, or with a juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the characters we bear, to perſiſt in holding out offers, which, in our eſtimation, required only to be known to be moſt gratefully accepted; and we have accordingly, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting only the commander in chief, who will be detained by military duties, reſolved to return to England a few weeks after the date of this manifeſto and proclamation.</p>
                        <p>"PREVIOUS, however, to this deciſive ſtep, we are led, by a juſt anxiety for the great objects of our miſſion, to enlarge on ſome points which may not have been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently underſtood, to recapitulate to our fellow ſubjects the bleſſings which we are empowered to confer, and to warn them of the continued train of evils to which they are at preſent blindly and obſtinately expoſing themſelves.</p>
                        <p>"TO the members of the Congreſs, then, we again declare, that we are ready to concur in all ſatisfactory and juſt arrangements for ſecuring to them and their reſpective conſtituents, the re-eſtabliſhment of peace, with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption from any impoſition of taxes by the parliament of
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:016625_0113_0F9D7084EB519598"/>
Great-Britain, and the irrevocable enjoyment of every privilege conſiſtent with that union of intereſts and force on which our mutual proſperity and the ſafety of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon religion and liberty depend. We again aſſert, that the members of the Congreſs were not authorized by their conſtitution either to reject our offers without the previous conſideration and conſent of the ſeveral Aſſemblies and Conventions, their conſtituents, or to refer us to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended foreign treaties, which they know are deluſively framed in the firſt inſtance, and which have never yet been ratified by the people of this continent. And we once more remind the members of the Congreſs, that they are reſponſible to their countrymen, to the world, and to God, for the continuance of this war, and for all the miſeries with which it muſt be attended.</p>
                        <p>"TO the General Aſſemblies and Conventions of the different colonies, plantations and provinces above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, we now ſeparately make the offers which we ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally tranſmitted to the Congreſs; and we hereby call upon and urge them to meet expreſsly for the purpoſe of conſidering whether every motive, political as well as moral, ſhould not decide their reſolution to embrace the occaſion of cementing a free and firm coalition with Great-Britain. It has not been, nor is it, our wiſh, to ſeek the objects which we are commiſſioned to purſue, by fomenting popular diviſions and partial cabals; we think ſuch conduct would be ill ſuited to the generous nature of the offers made, and unbecoming the dignity of the king and the ſtate which makes them. But it is both our wiſh and our duty to encourage and ſupport any men or bodies of men in their return of loyalty to our ſovereign and of affection to our fellow-ſubjects.</p>
                        <p>"TO all others, free inhabitants of this once happy em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, we alſo addreſs ourſelves. Such of them as are actually in arms, of whatſoever rank or deſcription, will do well to recollect, that the grievances, whether real or ſuppoſed, which led them into this rebellion, have been for-ever removed, and that the juſt occaſion is arrived for their returning to the claſs of peaceful citizens. But if the honors of a military life are become their object, let
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:016625_0114_0F9D7085A95A2A98"/>
them ſeek thoſe honors under the banners of their right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſovereign, and in fighting the battles of the united Britiſh empire againſt our late mutual and natural enemy.</p>
                        <p>"TO thoſe whoſe profeſſion it is to exerciſe the functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of religion on this continent, it cannot ſurely be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, that the foreign power with which the Congreſs is endeavoring to connect them, has ever been averſe to toleration, and inveterately oppoſed to the intereſts and freedom of the places of worſhip which they ſerve; and that Great-Britain, from whom they are for the preſent ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, muſt, both from the principles of her conſtitution and of proteſtantiſm, be at all times the beſt guardian of religious liberty, and moſt diſpoſed to promote and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it.</p>
                        <p>"TO all thoſe who can eſtimate the bleſſings of peace, and its influence over agriculture, arts and commerce, who can feel a due anxiety for the education and eſtabliſhment of their children, or who can place a juſt value on do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic ſecurity, we think it ſufficient to obſerve, that they are made by their leaders to continue involved in all the calamities of war, without having either a juſt object to purſue, or a ſubſiſting grievance which may not inſtantly be redreſſed.</p>
                        <p>"BUT if there be any perſons who, diverted of miſtaken reſentments, and uninfluenced by ſelfiſh intereſts, really think that it is for the benefit of the colonies to ſeparate themſelves from Great-Britain, and that, ſo ſeparated, they will find a conſtitution more mild, more free, and better calculated for their proſperity than that which they heretofore enjoyed, and which we are empowered and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to renew and improve; with ſuch perſons we will not diſpute a poſition which ſeems to be ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted by the experience they have had. But we think it right to leave them fully aware of the change which the maintaining ſuch a poſition muſt make in the whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and future conduct of this war; more eſpecially when to this poſition is added the pretended alliance with the court of France.—The policy, as well as the benevolence of Great-Britain, have thus far checked the extremes of
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:016625_0115_0F9D708669973F50"/>
war, when they tended to diſtreſs a people ſtill conſidered as our fellow-ſubjects, and to deſolate a country ſhortly to become again a ſource of mutual advantage: But when that country proſeſſes the unnatural deſign not only of eſtranging herſelf from us, but of mortgaging herſelf and her reſources to our enemies, the whole conteſt is changed; and the queſtion is, how far Great-Britain may, by every means in her power, deſtroy or render uſeleſs a connection contrived for her ruin, and for the aggrandizement of France. Under ſuch circumſtances the laws of ſelf-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation muſt direct the conduct of Great-Britain; and if the Britiſh colonies are to become an acceſſion to France, will direct her to render that acceſſion of as little avail as poſſible to her enemy.</p>
                        <p>"IF, however, there are any who think, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding theſe reaſonings, the independence of the colonies will, in the reſult, be acknowledged by Great-Britain; to them we anſwer without reſerve, that we neither poſſeſs or expect powers for that purpoſe; and that, if Great-Britain could ever have ſunk ſo low as to adopt ſuch a meaſure, we ſhould not have thought ourſelves compellable to be the inſtruments in making a conceſſion, which would, in our opinion, be calamitous to the colonies, for whom it is made, and diſgraceful, as well as calamitous, to the country from which it is required. And we think proper to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that in this ſpirit and ſentiment we have regularly written from this continent to Great-Britain.</p>
                        <p>"IT will now become the colonies in general to call to mind their own ſolemn appeals to Heaven in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this conteſt, that they took arms only for the redreſs of grievances, and that it would be their wiſh, as well as their intereſt, to remain for-ever connected with Great-Britain. We again aſk them, whether all their grievances, real or ſuppoſed, have not been amply and fully redreſſed? And we inſiſt, that the offers we have made, leave nothing to be wiſhed, in point either of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate liberty or permanent ſecurity: If thoſe offers are now rejected, we withdraw from the exerciſe of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion with which we have in vain been honored; the ſame liberality will no longer be due from Great-Britain,
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:016625_0116_0F9D708729F45758"/>
nor can it either in juſtice or policy be expected from her.</p>
                        <p>"IN fine, and for the fuller manifeſtation as well of the diſpoſition we bear, as of the gracious and generous pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of the commiſſion under which we act, we hereby declare, that whereas his majeſty, in purſuance of an act, made and paſſed in the eighteenth ſeſſion of parliament, entitled, <q>An act to enable his majeſty to appoint Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners with ſufficient powers to treat, conſult and agree upon the means of quieting the diſorders now ſubſiſting in certain of the colonies, plantations and provinces of North-America,</q> having been pleaſed to authorize and empower us to grant a pardon or pardons to any number or deſcription of perſons within the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, plantations and provinces of New-Hampſhire, Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts-Bay, Rhode-Iſland, Connecticut, New-York, New-Jerſey, Pennſylvania, the three lower Counties on Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North-Carolina, South-Carolina and Georgia: And whereas the good effects of the ſaid authorities and powers towards the people at large, would have long ſince taken place, if a due uſe had been made of our firſt communications and overtures, and have thus far been fruſtrated only by the precipitate reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the members of the Congreſs not to treat with us, and by their declining to conſult with their conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuents: We now, in making our appeal to thoſe conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuents, and to the free inhabitants of this continent in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, have determined to give to them what in our opinion ſhould have been the firſt object of thoſe who appeared to have taken the management of their intereſts, and adopt this mode of carrying the ſaid authorities and powers into execution. <hi>We accordingly hereby grant and proclaim a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don or pardons of all and all manner of treaſons or miſpriſions of treaſons, by any perſon or perſons, or by any number or deſcription of perſons within the ſaid colonies, plantations or provinces, counſelled, commanded, acted or done on or before the date of this manifeſto and proclamation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>"AND we farther declare and proclaim, that if any perſon or perſons, or any number or deſcription of perſons within the ſaid colonies, plantations and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, now actually ſerving either in a civil or military

                        <p>"AND we think proper farther to declare, that nothing herein contained is meant, or ſhall be conſtrued, to ſet at liberty any perſon or perſons now being a priſoner or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, or who, during the continuance of this rebellion, ſhall become a priſoner or priſoners.</p>
                        <p>"AND we offer to the colonies at large, or ſeparately, a general or ſeparate peace, with the revival of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient governments ſecured againſt any future infringe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and protected for-ever from taxation by Great-Britain. And, with reſpect to ſuch farther regulations, whether civil, military or commercial, as they may wiſh to be framed and eſtabliſhed, we promiſe all the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and aſſiſtance that his majeſty's commiſſion au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorizes and enables us to give.</p>
                        <p>"AND we declare, that this manifeſto and proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall continue and be in force <hi>forty days</hi> from the date thereof, that is to ſay, from the third day of October to the eleventh day of November, both incluſive.</p>
                        <p>"AND, in order that the whole contents of this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſto and proclamation may be more fully known, we ſhall direct copies thereof, both in the Engliſh and Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man language, to be tranſmitted by flags of truce to the

Congreſs, the General Aſſemblies or Conventions of the colonies, plantations and provinces, and to ſeveral perſons both in civil and military capacities within the ſaid colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, plantations and provinces. And, for the further ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity in times to come of the ſeveral perſons or numbers or deſcriptions of perſons who are or may be the objects of this manifeſto and proclamation, we have ſet our hands and ſeals to thirteen copies thereof, and have tranſmitted the ſame to the thirteen colonies, plantations and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces above-mentioned; and we are willing to hope that the whole of this manifeſto and proclamation will be fairly and freely publiſhed and circulated for the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate, general and moſt ſerious conſideration and benefit of all his majeſty's ſubjects on this continent. And we ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly exhort all perſons who by this inſtrument forthwith receive the benefit of the king's pardon, at the ſame time that they entertain a becoming ſenſe of thoſe lenient and affectionate meaſures whereby they are now freed from many grievous charges which might have riſen in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or have been brought in queſtion againſt them, to make a wiſe improvement of the ſituation in which this manifeſto and proclamation places them, and not only to recollect, that a perſeverance in the preſent rebellion, or any adherence to the treaſonable connection attempted to be framed with a foreign power, will, after the preſent grace extended, be conſidered as crimes of the moſt aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated kind, but to vie with each other in eager and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial endeavors to ſecure their own peace and promote and eſtabliſh the proſperity of their countrymen and the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral weal of the empire.</p>

                        <p>"THESE United States having been driven to hoſtilities by the oppreſſive and tyrannous mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Great-Britain; having been compelled to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the eſſential rights of man to the deciſion of arms; and having been at length forced to ſhake off a yoke which had grown too burthenſome to bear, they declared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves free and independent.</p>
                        <p>"CONFIDING in the juſtice of their cauſe; confiding in HIM who diſpoſes of human events, although weak and unprovided, they ſet the power of their enemies at defiance.</p>
                        <p>"IN this confidence they have continued through the various fortune of three bloody campaigns, unawed by the power, unſubdued by the barbarity of their foes. Their virtuous citizens have borne, without repining, the loſs of many things which make life deſirable. Their brave troops have patiently endured the hardſhips and dangers of a ſituation, fruitful in both beyond former example.</p>
                        <p>"THE Congreſs, conſidering themſelves bound to love their enemies, as children of that Being who is equally the Father of all; and deſirous, ſince they could not prevent, at leaſt to alleviate, the calamities of war, have ſtudied to ſpare thoſe who were in arms againſt them, and to lighten the chains of captivity.</p>
                        <p>"THE conduct of thoſe ſerving under the king of Great-Britain hath, with ſome few exceptions, been diametrically oppoſite. They have laid waſte the open country, burned the defenceleſs villages, and butchered the citizens of America. Their priſons have been the ſlaughter-houſes of her ſoldiers, their ſhips of her ſeamen,
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:016625_0120_0F9D708AEBA40710"/>
and the ſevereſt injuries have been aggravated by the groſſeſt inſult.</p>
                        <p>"FOILED in their vain attempt to ſubjugate the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquerable ſpirit of freedom, they have meanly aſſailed the repreſentatives of America with bribes, with deceit, and the ſervility of adulation. They have made a mock of humanity, by the wanton deſtruction of men: They have made a mock of religion, by impious appeals to God whilſt in the violation of his ſacred commands: They have made a mock even of reaſon itſelf, by endeavoring to prove, that the liberty and happineſs of America could ſafely be entruſted to thoſe who have <hi>ſold their own,</hi> unawed by the ſenſe of virtue or of ſhame.</p>
                        <p>"TREATED with the contempt which ſuch conduct deſerved, they have applied to individuals: They have ſolicited them to break the bonds of allegiance, and imbue their ſouls with the blackeſt of crimes: But, fearing that none could be found through theſe United States equal to the wickedneſs of their purpoſe, to influence weak minds, they have threatened more wide devaſtation.</p>
                        <p>"WHILE the ſhadow of hope remained, that our enemies could be taught by our example to reſpect thoſe laws which are held ſacred among civilized nations, and to comply with the dictates of a religion which they pretend in common with us to believe and to revere, they have been left to the influence of that religion and that example. But ſince their incorrigible diſpoſitions cannot be touched by kindneſs and compaſſion, it becomes our duty by other means to vindicate the rights of humanity.</p>

On the part of America it is declared, that if the war is proſecuted in a manner not conformable to the laws of nations, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of her enemies ſhall be retaliated.</p>
            <p>IF our enemies were under the guidance of reaſon, they would deſiſt from thoſe efforts with which they threaten us; 1ſt. Becauſe, although they may burn many defence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs towns, and ravage much of the open country, the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to ruin us muſt be unſucceſsful, and the expence of it enormous; not to mention that their whole force is neceſſary for their own defence, which neceſſity will daily increaſe. 2dly. Becauſe their barbarity, by exaſperating more the minds of the Americans, will more effectually wean them from all attachment to, and connection with, Great-Britain, as well political as commercial. 3dly. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they muſt expect that our allies will afford every aid in their power to vindicate the violated rights of nations; which indeed they are bound to do, not only in common with all other ſovereigns, but by the powerful principles of faith and affection. And 4thly. Becauſe ſuch conduct on their part would juſtify on ours not only the breach of any compacts which might be entered into, but even the moſt ſanguinary meaſures at the moſt diſtant period; nay more, would demand a remembrance of the injury, until ſuch ample vengeance would be taken as would in future pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſimilar inſults from others.</p>
            <p>BUT the unreaſonableneſs of theſe meaſures is very far
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:016625_0122_0F9D708C69FC4698"/>
from being a concluſive argument why they will not adopt them; 1ſt. Becauſe their whole conduct, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to this country, bears ſuch ſtrong marks of folly, that to ſuppoſe they will not obſtinately perſiſt in it, would argue a degree of weakneſs and infidelity. 2dly. Becauſe it is perhaps neceſſary that they ſhould make a viſitation to every ſtate, in order to purge it of the moſt turbulent part of the diſaffected, and puniſh the remainder by the deſtruction of their property, thereby bringing home to their feelings that conviction which was not to be effected in the common way of reaſoning. 3dly. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſomething muſt be allowed to the anguiſh of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed avarice and ambition; for, ſince no hope re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of acquiring that dominion which was the object of their fervent deſires, it is perfectly natural that men, free from the influence of juſtice o<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> humanity, ſhould take any and every method to ſatiate the vengeance of defeated deſpotiſm. And 4thly. Becauſe, as they ſuppoſe, they have offended us beyond forgiveneſs; ſo they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that we ſhall be ſtimulated by paſſions like their own, to proſecute their ruin: In which caſe, being too haughty to aſk our friendſhip, they have no alternative but to endeavor to render our enmity as little dangerous as poſſible.</p>
            <p>ON the other hand, the determination of America to retaliate, is dictated by every motive of policy and juſtice, and muſt terminate to the great prejudice of Britain, and the ruin of her adherents on this ſide of the Atlantic: Nor can the means be wanting; the towns on her coaſt are at leaſt as defenceleſs as ours; and their citizens, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed to arms, are utterly incapable of repelling an aſſault. A ſmall ſum of money would wrap their metropolis in flames. Their ſubjects and adherents may eaſily be found in any part of the earth; and the dreaded ſcalping-knife itſelf may, in the hands of our riflemen, ſpread horror through their iſland. Theſe and many other methods may readily be deviſed; and certainly ſome critical mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will offer itſelf in the flow of time to proclaim to them the injuries of America in the rough ſounds of merited barbarity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="122" facs="unknown:016625_0123_0F9D708D2FC1D868"/>CONSIDERING our preſent ſituation and connections, we cannot but be ſenſible that the independence of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica is fully ſecured, and nothing left to guard againſt but the ravages of a cruel foe, and the derangement of our finances. To effect the former, we muſt hold ourſelves ready to repel force by force wherever aſſailed, and firmly retort every infringement of the law of nations with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeling perſeverance. To remedy the latter, oeconomy in the expenditure of money, and taxation, are the natural means, and, in addition to theſe, private oeconomy, founded on a conviction that the monies wantonly expended in the preſent moment of depreciation, will ſoon be deeply regretted when it hath recovered its full value. By ſuch ſteps we ſhall fruſtrate the deſigns of our enemies, and haſten that moment when the United States of North-America, riſing from diſtreſs to glory, ſhall diſpenſe to their citizens the bleſſings of that peace, liberty and ſafety for which we have virtuouſly and vigorouſly contended.</p>
            <p>THE portals of the temple we have raiſed to freedom, ſhall then be thrown wide, as an aſylum to mankind. America ſhall receive to her boſom and comfort and cheer the oppreſſed, the miſerable and the poor of every nation and of every clime. The enterpriſe of extending com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce ſhall wave her friendly flag over the billows of the remoteſt regions. Induſtry ſhall collect and bear to her ſhores all the various productions of the earth, and all by which human life and human manners are poliſhed and adorned. In becoming acquainted with the religions, the cuſtoms and the laws, the wiſdom, virtues and follies and prejudices of different countries, we ſhall be taught to cheriſh the principles of general benevolence. We ſhall learn to conſider all men as our brethren, being equally children of the Univerſal Parent—that God of the heavens and of the earth, whoſe infinite majeſty, for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential favor during the late revolution, almighty power in our preſervation from impending ruin, and gracious mercy in our redemption from the iron ſhackles of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotiſm, we cannot ceaſe with gratitude and with deep humility to praiſe, to reverence and adore.</p>
