            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have read over thy Sermon, which thou didſt preach, or read, to thy people, at the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy New Place, which, thou haſt named by the name of CHAPPEL: doubtleſs to remind all men, that the doctrine common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taught there; is Popiſh Doctrine: I do not mean, that thou teacheſt Tranſubſtantiation; or Obedience to the Pope of <hi>Rome;</hi> for thou art evidently, too much a Pope thy ſelf, to be ſubject to another; and art too much devoted to the Goddeſs <hi>Reaſon,</hi> to admit of any myſtery, much leſs abſurdity into thy Creed. It was in thy heart, to read a Sermon to thy people, on the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; it was not well, it was in thy heart to do ſo; for I am afraid, it was the pride of thy heart to do ſo; to chuſe to do it thy ſelf, rather than employ any one of thy friends, in ſuch a ſervice; which thou knoweſt, is the uſual cuſtom, amongſt thy fraternity. Indeed friend <hi>John,</hi> though thy principles are pretty much the ſame with ours, I am ſurpriz'd at thy vanity in being ſo taken with a gaudy, ſhowy, coſtly building: this is quite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with thy other pretenſions. Thou mayſt talk of humility, 'till thy tongue aches, no body can or will think thee to be in earneſt, while thy prieſtly robes and coſtly temple do evidently ſo much ingroſs thy thôts. Be adviſed by me neighbour <hi>John</hi> and pull off thy maſk; lay aſide thy prieſtly garments; put on a plain Lay-dreſs, and come among us; we will receive thee:
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:008069_0005_102FC787871A34F0"/>
thy reaſon and our Light within will very well agree. I am a little afraid thou wilt make poor work of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and his operations, but if thou wilt but be teachable, we will ſoon put thee into the way of it. Pray friend <hi>John</hi> how cameſt thou to chuſe to be called Chriſtian? or what right haſt thou to that name any more than we? Thou denieſt original ſin, ſo do we: thou denieſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted righteouſneſs, ſo do we; thou denieſt Chriſt's ſatisfaction, ſo do we: thou expecteſt to be ſaved by thy own righteouſneſs, and for thy own good deeds, ſo do we. In ſhort thou denieſt almoſt all the doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines which are well known among Proteſtants by the name of <hi>the great doctrines of the reformation from Popery;</hi> ſo do we; becauſe they are contrary to our <hi>Light within;</hi> and thou denieſt them becauſe they are contrary to thy reaſon: ſo then our <hi>Light within</hi> and thy <hi>Reaſon</hi> ſeem to be much the ſame. Why then doſt thou not come among us, to whom thou doſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſo naturally belong? Or art thou determin'd to increaſe the number of ſectaries, and to the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parians, Preſbyterians, Independants, Anabaptiſts, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſts, Arians, Trinitarians, Whitfilites, Weſtleites, add the venerable name of <hi>Talorians: Taylor!</hi> a moſt reſpectable name; the moſt ancient name in the world; our father <hi>Adam</hi> being by trade a Taylor, which by the way, is the moſt reputable buſineſs with all rational beings, becauſe entirely natural. Happy man therefore art thou in this thy name, and art evidently as much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to be the head of a party, as ever <hi>Adam</hi> was to be the father of poſterity: and certainly more fit for it, foraſmuch as thou art wiſer than <hi>Adam;</hi> for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out flattery, I think it more reaſonable to ſuppoſe thee as wiſe as Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton,</hi> than it was for thee to ſuppoſe him wiſer than <hi>Adam;</hi> and to be plain with thee, and convince thee that I flatter thee not, I ſhould be of the ſame mind if I knew thee to be a fool.</p>
            <p>But I ſay to thee again; pull off thy maſk and be
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:008069_0006_102FC78ED2366638"/>
not aſhamed to declare thy ſelf either a Quaker or a Romiſh prieſt. How doſt thou dare to call thy ſelf Chriſtian, when thou knoweſt in thy own heart that thou believeſt not the peculiar doctrines of chriſtianity? which we alſo believe not, and for this plain reaſon as I ſaid before, becauſe our <hi>Light within,</hi> as thy <hi>Reaſon</hi> comprehendeth them not.</p>
            <p>Thou didſt publiſh as I am told, ſome years ago, <hi>The Aſſembly's Catechiſm reviſed and rendered fitter for General Uſe;</hi> by what authority thou didſt do it, no body knows but thy ſelf, though any body may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe by the contents of that performance, it was done by the command of the Pope of <hi>Rome;</hi> it being direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrary to reformation-principles.</p>
            <p>Thou art now publiſhing a very Great Work, and as thou wouldeſt have the world believe, a very learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed work, <hi>A Hebrew Bible Dictionary;</hi> I will recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to thee as the laſt work of thy life, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat all thy works, to publiſh <hi>The Holy Bible reviſed and made more fit for General Uſe:</hi> As it now ſtands it is by no means fit for thy purpoſe; witneſs the dreadful havock thou haſt made with <hi>Pſal,</hi> li. ver. 5.</p>
            <p>But I forget my ſelf: thou art an oracle, and as ſuch, to be conſulted by all thy votaries, thô they may all ſpare their pains, for two words are the ſum of all thou haſt to ſay. <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Candour; Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Candour; Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Candour;</hi> and the miſchief of all is thou meaneſt no more by them than the mad-brain'd <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> mob did by <hi>Great is Diana of the Epheſians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Be honeſt, open and free then my dear friend, tell the world what thou art, but for ſhame call not thy ſelf Chriſtian: for why ſhouldſt thou arrogate this name to thy ſelf any more than we? we do not profeſs our ſelves Chriſtians; we believe Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> to have been a very good man, to have ſet a noble ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of patience, humility, obedience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but we have no dependance on him, we put no truſt in him
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:008069_0007_102FC79055D658E8"/>
any more than thou doſt. Poor <hi>Paul</hi> indeed in an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſtical fit, cries out: <hi>I know whom I have truſted, and I am perſwaded he is able to keep that which I have committed to him againſt that day.</hi> And <hi>Iſaiah</hi> in the ſame ſort of paroxiſm, cries out, <hi>Truſt ye in the Lord for ever; for in the Lord Jehovah is everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrength.</hi> But then you know <hi>Paul</hi> was a Chriſtian profeſt, a rank one, ready to ſacrifice every thing to the cauſe of Chriſtianity: declar'd its doctrines diſagreable as they were to the prejudiced reaſon of men of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt minds: own'd himſelf a believer of them, though they were to the fooliſh infidel Jews a ſtumbling-block, and to the wiſe rational Greeks fooliſhneſs. So they were in the apoſtolic age: ſo they ſtill are to you and me; and to all in our way; nor can I ſee any help for it; ſince it is evident beyond all contradiction that Chriſtianity propoſes ſuch principles which thy <hi>Reaſon</hi> and my <hi>Light within</hi> can never admit. That Jeſus Chriſt is truly God, the creator of all things viſible and inviſible, is plainly enough taught in the old and new teſtament, but neither our <hi>Light within,</hi> nor thy Reaſon can comprehend how this can be; and therefore we leave it to the faith of men, who believe any thing that God declares, however myſterious and incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to credit what we can give no credit to; our <hi>Light within</hi> and thy <hi>Reaſon</hi> are both ſuperiour to any reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, juſt as a judge is ſuperior to the counſellors, to the lawyers, yea to the poor criminals he is to try. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, there is this difference between thee and us: we have try'd revelation, and find it contains ſuch principles as our <hi>Light within</hi> calls abſurd, therefore like honeſt men we gravely diſcard it. But thou and thoſe in thy way have the impudence of ten thouſand harlots, while with brows of braſs ye hold the Bible in your hands, tell the world <hi>that</hi> contains your religion; and at the ſame time deny all its peculiar, and diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doctrines. This! this! is that which has fill'd this

land with Atheiſts; this is the curſed root of that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity now prevailing in the world: this! this! is the maſter-piece of the old ſerpent's ſubtilty, who hath been for a long time let looſe to deceive the nations.</p>
            <p>Surely, friend <hi>John,</hi> it is time to lay theſe things to heart, to think ſeriouſly what the iſſue of theſe practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces will be: thou haſt the art of writing very ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and if thou art not ſincere in what thou writeſt, thou art a very bad man indeed: but thou knoweſt thy ſelf to mean as thou ſayeſt; and this is to be thy excuſe, how wrong ſoever thou art.</p>
            <p>But pray, neighbour <hi>John,</hi> was not <hi>Paul,</hi> whom thou haſt lucubrated on, ſincere when a perſecutor? Yea, thou wilt ſay, and a good man too; thoſe in thy way ſay ſo; but pray now, are we to credit thee and them, or the apoſtle himſelf? I ſuppoſe thou think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt it was his modeſty that made him ſay, <hi>I obtained mercy, becauſe I did it ignorantly in unbelief;</hi> but let me tell thee, thy thinking, and the thinking of thoſe in thy way is no rule, or ſtandard of truth. And unleſs truth and falſehood, good and evil be the ſame, it is my opinion, <hi>Paul</hi> was not a good man, 'till he was convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and I am ſure he himſelf thought ſo. But thou art a very wiſe man, and haſt gotten a key, a well wro't one too, to the apoſtolick writings: thou waſt, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, brought up at the feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> a cotempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary with the apoſtle <hi>Paul;</hi> or like him haſt been caught up to heaven, and there converſed with <hi>Paul,</hi> who, has told thee how to explain the goſpel ſcheme, and the principal words and phraſes, the apoſtles have uſed in deſcribing it. I wiſh then thou wouldſt be ſo honeſt as to uſe words and phraſes as they are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood, and do not any longer be ſo wicked as to uſe words and phraſes with thy own meaning affixed to them; which meaning, no body thinks of but thy ſelf, and thoſe in thy way, nor ever thought of 'till thou <hi>Great Genius</hi> aroſe to enlighten the dark and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nighted world.</p>

Take heed, neighbour <hi>John,</hi> thou art upon a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous pinnacle, the pinnacle of pride; thou boaſteſt thy ſelf to be ſomebody, &amp; thou &amp; thy admirers are great folks in your own opinions; but great as thou art, thy pride may be ſoon abaſed: and thy ſcheme, fond as thou art of it, may be brought to nought. Some people think, fine as it is, and pleaſing to the pride and flattery of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, that it is built on the ſand, and therefore cannot ſtand, when ever a ſtorm comes, but will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly fall, <hi>and great will be the fall thereof.</hi> — Doſt thou really think that thou underſtandeſt the <hi>Greek</hi> lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage better than any one elſe? or that none read the <hi>Greek</hi> Teſtament but thee and thy friends, that thou takeſt upon thee to be ſuch a dictator, and to write all that thou writeſt in ſuch a magiſterial ſtrain? Surely more humble and candid language would better correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pond with thy pretenſions; eſpecially as thou art aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to introduce an <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

            <p>I cannot conceive, friend <hi>John,</hi> why thou and thy friends have been at ſo great expence in procuring the nobleſt place of the kind, for thee and thoſe in thy way to ſpeak in: this could not proceed from ſuch a ſpirit and temper as thy maſter poſſeſſed. I ſuppoſe in the city where thou dwelleſt, a place good enough for thee to ſpeak in and for thy friends to hear, might have been well finiſhed for fifteen hundred pounds, what account then will ye give to your Great Lord and final Judge for two thouſand pounds and upwards, ſunk and waſted, which might have been a noble generous fund for the poor? Or may be ye are all rich; have no poor among you, yet as the whole world are God's offspring and we are all one common fraternity, I think it would have been a noble, generous, diſintereſted ſcheme to have two thouſand pounds or more, as a fund, raiſed by a few profeſſed chriſtians at <hi>Norwich,</hi> on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe

to relieve any diſtreſſed among mankind all the world over. By this means thy name would found to the ends of the earth, and thy remembrance laſt from generation to generation: but thy humanity and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal love doth not yet extend it ſelf ſo far: may be ye will do this alſo, and verily if what I write ſhould put it into your heads, for without doubt ye have it in your hearts naturally; generoſity, humanity, benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, boundleſs and univerſal love growing in their native ſoil. I ſay, if what I write ſhould put it into your head to raiſe a fund for the purpoſe above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, I ſhall think my ſelf amply rewarded for my trouble, in having the bleſſings of the poor ſo long as the world endureth.—</p>
            <p>As thy principles are ſo diametrically oppoſite to the articles of the eſtabliſh'd Creed, it was very politick in thee to declare thy reſpect for king GEORGE, whoſe mild and merciful government gives thee liberty to be any thing but a profeſt Atheiſt, and to write any thing except direct Infidelity. But give me leave to tell thee that thou art quite miſtaken in thinking that what thou haſt written is generally approved, for bad as this kingdom is, there are thouſands and ten thouſands in it who hate thy principles almoſt as they hate Atheiſm it ſelf, and Great as thou thinkeſt thy ſelf to be, regard thee in this very diſagreeable view, as fatan himſelf transformed into an angel of light: When thou pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſheſt again I would like to ſee thy paraphraſe on this paſſage, and that thou wouldſt tell the world what ſort of Being the devil is when ſo transformed; and whether this reſpects his intellectual or practical conduct. Thy key will undoubtedly do here, being a key of the moſt excellent temperature, and workmanſhip, ſo admirably contrived, as to be able to unlock every hard and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult paſſage, however hamper'd, or cover'd over with Calvinian ſuperſtition or Reformation ruſt. Thy key of knowledge will do wonderful things, it would if

poſſible make light darkneſs, good evil, truth error; at leaſt it will do its utmoſt to confound theſe things to blend them together, and ſo make it ſtill more difficult to the human mind to diſtinguiſh one from the other. No man talks more of truth than thou doſt, and no man ſeems to underſtand what truth is, leſs than thy ſelf: I mean, if Revelation be the ſtandard of truth; but if thy <hi>Reaſon</hi> and the <hi>Reaſon</hi> of the men in <hi>thy way,</hi> as our <hi>inward Light,</hi> be the ſtandard, then for ought I know thou mayſt underſtand what truth is as well as any ſince the days of <hi>Lock</hi> and <hi>Newton:</hi> but then thou knoweſt theſe men's <hi>Light,</hi> like thine and ours, was ſuperior to that of Revelation, ſo not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated by it. It is by thy <hi>Reaſon</hi> that thou judgeſt of Revelation and all the doctrines therein contained: what thou findeſt there which thy <hi>Reaſon</hi> can take up and account for rationally, that thou giveſt credit to, but wherever Revelation forſakes thy <hi>Reaſon,</hi> or ſoars above it, there thou forſakeſt that and getteſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove it too; ſo art even. This is thy manner, and this ours, and ſurely this is the right way of proceeding: for any doctrine which we cannot clearly take in, or which reaſon, every man's reaſon cannot as clearly and as rationally underſtand as that two and two are equal to four, can be no doctrine for rational Beings to give credit to.</p>
            <p>This then at one happy ſtroke cuts off the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received doctrines of the Trinity, the true and proper Diety of the Son and Spirit two natures in Chriſt: ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſin, imputed righteouſneſs, juſtification by faith; particular election; efficacious grace; regeneration and converſion; ſanctification by the Spirit's influences; and final perſeverance; and having ſtrip'd Chriſtianity of theſe exereſſences, which like Wens on the body have been long a moſt grievous incumbrance, it leaves it a moſt delightful ſyſtem of <hi>Paganiſm improv'd.</hi>

My mentioning this, puts me in mind of a name which thou and we, and all in thy way ought to go by, and that is <hi>improv'd Pagans;</hi> that of <hi>Quakers</hi> for us, and <hi>New-Light</hi> Men for you, doth not ſound half ſo pretty, nor is it half ſo juſt as <hi>improv'd Pagans.</hi> Hail! then ye wiſe Men of <hi>the Eaſt,</hi> who have been conducted by ſome auſpicious Star to theſe Climes of Darkneſs, to give knowledge to the ignorant, to knock of the ſetters of ſuperſtition and bigotry, and to adminiſter ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions as never entered into the human heart, 'till ye great men aroſe, and with a courage and reſolution ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to all that ever went before you, have adventured to take ſuch liberties with the ſacred volume, which were you to take with <hi>Virgil</hi> or <hi>Homer,</hi> you would run the riſk of being hooted thro' the ſtreets for a company of owls.—But thou art a very wiſe man, ſo wiſe that wiſdom is to die with thee, and therefore no wonder that thou haſt found out the grand ſecret which has been hid from all the world, 'till thou by thy great ſagacity and penetrating eye, haſt diſcovered it. That we are all Chriſtians, &amp; only Chriſtians, Chriſtians &amp; only Chriſtians, tho' both practically &amp; doctrinally we know nothing of Chriſt, nor deſire it: Chriſtians tho' nothing that is pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chriſtian be any part of our creed: Chriſtians tho' no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of chriſtianity be believed by us; for I would aſk thee what doſt thou believe concerning Jeſus Chriſt, which we do not believe? and yet didſt thou ever know that we have even coveted the chriſtian name? What thou meaneſt by it then thou wouldeſt do well to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, and let the world know why thou chuſeſt to be called Chriſtian rather than Antichriſtian, and why thou art not content with calling thy ſelf a Man, or a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for as ſuch thou knoweſt that thou ſtandeſt in the ſame relation to the univerſal Parent, as the Turk or Jew, and they are equally God's offspring as thy ſelf, thou being of the ſame family, of the ſame fraternity, all brethren.</p>

I find I muſt call back one ſentiment expreſs'd in the beginning of this my Epiſtle: namely that the Goddeſs Reaſon will not ſuffer thee to admit any abſurdity into thy Creed. Now on ſecond thoughts I find thou haſt admitted an abſurdity as great as can be invented: and this thy boaſted reaſon can admit, which like the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a Roman Catholick, can admit of any thing but truth and found divinity. But what is this abſurdity thou wilt ſay? why truly nothing leſs than this, that the Creator is a Creature, that he that made the worlds was made himſelf; in ſhort, that Jeſus Chriſt is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior God: now I defy thee and all the men in thy way to produce a greater abſurdity than this. Thou hadſt much better with us, be conſiſtent with reaſon, and declare he is no God at all, for nothing is more plain than this, that Revelation declares for one God, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son and Holy Ghoſt. Indeed this is not ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal according as reaſon is now in man; but that it is ſcriptural is as plain as that there is any ſuch book called the Bible.</p>
            <p>Pray now my friend, think of this a little more, and conſider what thou meaneſt by calling thy ſelf Chriſtian, and at the ſame time betraying thy maſter's cauſe; call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy ſelf Chriſtian, and at the ſame time diſcarding from thy Creed, (for a Creed thou haſt as well as other men), almoſt every Notion, almoſt every Principle that is properly Chriſtian. I wonder what thy friends <hi>Owen, Howe, Charnock</hi> or <hi>Flavel,</hi> would ſay to thee, if they were now in our world: they were Chriſtians and only Chriſtians as well as thee, but I ſuppoſe thy vanity prompts thee to ſuſpect that they underſtood nothing of Chriſtianity comparatively with thee. This I am ſure of, if they were in the <hi>main Right,</hi> thou art in the <hi>main Wrong,</hi> unleſs right and wrong be ſynonimous terms, and I almoſt think they are ſo with thee; for if thou liveſt a little longer, and writeſt a little more, I ſhall expect to ſee a pamphlet intitled, <hi>John againſt

            <p>Indeed, friend <hi>John,</hi> though I reſpect thee as a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſt &amp; philoſopher, yet as a Chriſtian divine, though a doctor, I muſt tell thee thou art an object of the greateſt pity or contempt among all parties but thy own.

Spare thy pains, my friend, ſpare thy pains, unleſs thou wilt embark in a better cauſe. What cauſe would I have thee to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark in, thou wilt ſay? alas, I fear thou haſt that cauſe to learn yet, notwithſtanding all thy learning, I mean the cauſe of <hi>experimental religion. Experimental re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> what is that? is there any thing of it in the Bible? if there be, ſtrange I ſhould not know of it! Sayſt thou ſo my Friend. Pray haſt thou carefully read over the book of Pſalms? if thou haſt, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not <hi>experimental religion</hi> there, it is a dead letter to thee I am ſure, whatever it be to us. <hi>Experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal religion,</hi> I am told, is only to be known by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and take my word for it, all barely rational men can know no more of it than a blind man, one born ſo, knows of colours; and that is little enough to be ſure; ſince there certainly is as much need of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſun as the natural to enable us to ſee things aright: but what am I ſaying, when it is well known thou and I are both perſwaded that this divine ſun we have both been bleſſed with all our days, thou with the divine ſun of <hi>natural Reaſon,</hi> and I with the ſame intellectual lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary the <hi>Light within?</hi> Be not affronted my friend <hi>John,</hi> at my ſtill claiming ſo near a relation; for I aſſure thee in my opinion, the cathedral of Paul at <hi>London,</hi> and that of <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> are not ſo alike, nor the church of <hi>England,</hi> and the church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſo near

a-kin as thou and I are. I will therefore claim rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for I ſhall like thee well if thou wilt but appear as a man, and lay aſide all apiſh airs. I mean airs of imitation: for why doſt thou wear the black gown ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the white? Surely it thou deſignedſt it as emblematical, the white would be much more agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to thy pretenſions of abſolute innocence, and native purity, more eſpecially as theſe have been preſerved by thee in ſo extraordinary a manner that thou cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, yea infallibly art the greateſt pattern of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence &amp; purity which has appeared in our world theſe many years, and therefore the moſt fit of all poor, weak, ſilly <hi>Adam</hi>'s offſpring to be at the head of old Hereſies new vamp'd: for I am ready to think all thou haſt ſaid or canſt ſay againſt old truth &amp; old ways, may be found in ſubſtance a among the old Hereticks men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd by father <hi>Auſtin;</hi> namely, the Simonians, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

It is proper for thee to conſider whether thou doſt well in ſowing ſuch tares afreſh, which grow ſo naturally in the human ſoil, and are like to bring forth a plentiful harveſt, to thy great joy no doubt, on ſuppoſition the enemy of ſouls, the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> and thou art joined in league aud confederacy: but if this is not to be ſuppoſed, what canſt thou mean in doing the devil's and the Pope's work for them, for that thy ſentiments are popiſh and diabolical will be evident ſo long as pride, ſuperſtition and bigotry are ſo. And as much as thou profeſſeſt to hate bigotry, there is not perhaps a greater bigot in the three kingdoms than thou art, ſo great a proficient art thou in calling things by wrong names: but thou haſt been a long while learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this art, and it muſt be ſaid, thou art at length a compleat maſter of it, at leaſt more ſo than any one elſe of the human race. What! neighbour <hi>John Taylor</hi> of the city of <hi>Norwich,</hi> a Bigot! the very

laſt man ſurely that ſhould be mention'd as being of ſuch a character! doth he not recommend himſelf as the moſt <hi>catholic</hi> man of the age? hath he not formed and is he not promoting the moſt extenſively <hi>catholick</hi> ſcheme that was ever invented! and what! after all a Bigot! what a deceitful, treacherous creature then is man! His writings prove him ſo, as any one may ſee who will read them. Pretences and reality are quite different things; facts are ſtubborn things. Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions quite yielding, will admit of almoſt any impreſſion; and this accounts for it that bigotry &amp; prejudice ſhould reign in the mind that pretends to the higheſt degrees of Charity, Catholiciſm and Candor.</p>
            <p>Indeed neighbour, I would gladly excuſe thee, and think the beſt of thee I poſſibly can; but thou art verily too guilty in this reſpect and very often, in the courſe of thy lucubrations, when thy argument runs ſadly low, thy aſtoniſhment, ſurprize and wonder, thy cenſure, reproach and ridicule run much too high: I do not ſay too high for thy Subject, but too high for thy pretenſions; thy pretenſions I mean, to candour, ſoftneſs and moderation. But poſſibly theſe and ſuch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like words were the firſt words that thou didſt learn to ſpeak, and as thou hadſt no ideas connected with them in thy infant ſtate, ſo thou haſt forgotten all thy life long to mean any thing by them, or poſſibly they are words uſed by thee, as many other words are both in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation and writing, as expletives, and ſo are deſigned for ſound, or to fill up a ſentence, rather than to convey any ſenſe or meaning: Be this as it will, I would adviſe thee for the future, in all thy publications, to put at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning or end of thy performance, an alphabet of all dubious or equivocal words thou uſeſt; that ſo thyreader may certainly &amp; infallibly know what thou meaneſt by what thou ſayeſt, for hitherto many, very many of thoſe who read thy lucubrations are greatly in the dark as to this: in my opinion thou doſt not uſe thy friends well in

treating them in this manner: And if I am not miſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, ſome of the moſt eminent of thy <hi>ſpeaking bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> have hinted ſo much to thee. It is time for thee to come out of the miſt and declare thyſelf. And be thou as honeſt in thy way as we are in ours, ſo thou wilt deſerve the reſpect of all, however they may differ from thee in religious opinions.</p>
            <p>There is one thing more I muſt not forget to hint to thee, and to the men in thy way. I obſerve with what peremptorineſs ye aſſert that God is by no means an arbitrary Being, without declaring what ye mean by arbitrary: now in my apprehenſion, and if I know what the word arbitrary does certainly and infallibly mean, no other being is arbitrary, abſolutely ſo, but God, as it is held forth and declared in the ſcriptures: nay, I find a Pagan prince, the proudeſt man the ſun ever ſaw aſſerting ſo much. <hi>And at the end of the days, I Nebuchadnezzer liſted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine underſtanding returned unto me, and I bleſſed the moſt High, and I praiſed and honoured him that liveth for ever, whoſe dominion is an everlaſting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation. And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can ſtay his hand, or ſay unto him, What doeſt thou ?</hi> Dan. iv. 34, 35. But perhaps thou thinkeſt this language of his was the effect of his phren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy, and therefore wild viſionary and enthuſiaſtic, and I know thou art terribly afraid of Enthuſiaſm: Well, ſhould this be granted thee, what wilt thou ſay to the words of Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>At that time Jeſus anſwered and ſaid, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, becauſe thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and haſt revealed them unto babes. Even ſo, Father, for ſo it ſeemed good in thy fight.</hi> Mat. xi. 25, 26. To get over this thou muſt ſtrain every nerve
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:008069_0018_102FC7B94F583CE8"/>
of thy reaſoning powers, thou muſt twiſt and turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout every word, and then put the whole paſſage into thy theological mould, and it ſhall turn our with an impreſſion of thy own forming; exactly ſuited to thy ſcheme however contrary to the genuine deſign of Chriſt Jeſus. Yet after all: <hi>Even ſo, Father, for ſo it ſeemed good in thy fight,</hi> is all the reaſon God will give in a thouſand and ten thouſand inſtances, in the kingdoms of nature, providence and grace: whether thy <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and our <hi>Light within</hi> will approve there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of or not. Thou knoweſt beſt what end thou haſt in what thou doeſt, but if thou really thinkeſt that the truth of God will more abound thrô thy lie, let me tell thee thou art greatly miſtaken, for truth needeth no covering, no deceit, no fraud to recommend it. Thou haſt the more reaſon to be open, honeſt and free, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thy king and country give thee leave to be ſo. In ſome former reigns the caſe was otherwiſe, but thou haſt no temptation now, to write or ſpeak aenigmatically. We may ſpeak what we will, and thou mayſt write what thou pleaſeſt without being perſecuted for ſo doing, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs thou thinkeſt animadverſions on thy Lucubrations, a ſpecies of perſecution: but this thou canſt not think without acknowledging thy ſelf a perſecutor. On the whole then let me adviſe thee to ſpeak out plainly, and tell the world what benefit Chriſtianity is of, according to thy ſcheme, if there is ſo much truth, honeſty, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſobriety among the heathen, as thou ſuppoſeſt, and that all things conſider'd they are better than the chriſtian world in general. Surely if thy ſuppoſitions be true, it had been better for the world to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained Heathens, and to have continued in their Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry and Superſtition, than that Chriſtianity ſhould ever have been introduced, eſpecially as according to thy notion of things the generality of chriſtians have been the moſt wicked, lewd, bloody and treacherous
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:008069_0019_102FC7BF2A97B3A8"/>
of all mankind. I am ready to apprehend thoſe lewd, wicked, bloody, treacherous men, if the matter be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into cloſely, were no Chriſtians at all, any more than <hi>Judas</hi> was a Chriſtian, or thoſe who are involv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the grand Apoſtacy. Theſe may indeed make pretenſions to the Name, as a lunatick may to royalty; but no more to do with the thing than he is heir to a crown: nevertheleſs they may ſay it, and repeat it too as often as thee; we are Chriſtians and only Chriſtians: we are Chriſtians and only Chriſtians: But aſk them, what a man ſhould be in order to have a Right to that name, and ſee if the anſwer will tally with the fact.</p>
            <p>Every one knows a Chriſtian ſhould be humble, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent, teachable, ready to ſubmit to the authority of divine revelation; and to credit what God declares, however ſuperior to human reaſon, however above man's comprehenſion. But if this is what a Chriſtian ſhould be, if this be what every real Chriſtian is, it is plain beyond all contradiction, that neither thee nor I, nor Any in our way, have any thing to do with the Chriſtian name. I would therefore adviſe thee for the future to lay no claim to it, unleſs thy deſign be to s;peak it fair and ſmoothly in the ear, while thou art wounding it under the fifth rib, and ſtriking a dagger into its very vitals: if this be thy deſign it muſt be owned thy path is plain before thee, and thou haſt made a conſiderable progreſs therein: and was I an abſolute enemy to Chriſtianity. I would ſay, <hi>In the name of Lucifer go on and proſper.</hi> But it is almoſt time for me to draw to a cloſe, which I ſhall ſoon do, after having offer'd thee a few hints more.</p>
            <p>Do not be diſpleaſed at my thus addreſſing thee: if thou art the honeſt man thou wouldeſt have the world believe thee to be, lay aſide <hi>Eſau</hi>'s raiment, pull off the goat-ſkin gloves, do not try to alter the voice, but ſpeak and act as thou art, be thou whatever thou wilt.

Happy art thou, and happy are thy people in this <hi>particular;</hi> and it would be a piece of cruelty not to congratulate ye all, on this account, ſince it is almoſt the only thing, which is like Chriſtianity, which is to be found amongſt you.</p>
            <p>I ſay again, my friend do not be angry, I wiſh better things could be ſaid of thee, and of others too, but the Truth, and nothing but the Truth will take place ſome time, and the ſooner the better. If theſe things are ſo, or if there be a tincture of Truth in what I have been briefly hinting, it is time for thee to think of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering thy courſe, and either to come among <hi>us,</hi> or go where thou moſt belongeſt to; but prithee do not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to increaſe the number of <hi>Sects,</hi> of which there are too many already in our land; enow indeed to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy one had he the wiſdom of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and did he live to the age of <hi>Methuſelah,</hi> to judge and determine what is right and what is wrong, among the numerous and jarring opinions invented by enterprizing men, the Don <hi>Quixots</hi> of their reſpective ages, from Dr. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> down to Doctor <hi>Ta<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I am juſt ready to finiſh, but only muſt beg thy pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience a little longer, by aſking thee what thou meaneſt by ſo unſcriptural and therefore, in ſpeaking concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, ſo irrational a phraſe as the ſupreme father? why wilt thou chooſe to be wiſe above what is written, when thou profeſſeſt the written word to be thy rule and ſtandard: what warrant haſt thou to call the father
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:008069_0021_102FC7C3DF334248"/>
ſupreme, any more than to call the ſon ſo? or doſt thou chooſe in direct contempt of what is commanded, and in oppoſition thereto, to honour the ſon leſs than the father? I pray thee now, as thou wilt call thyſelf a Chriſtian, what hath the Father done for thee and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which the Son and Spirit have no hand in? what has the Son done for thee and others which the Father and Holy Ghoſt have nothing to do with? or what has the Spirit of God done for thee and others which ye are no ways indebted to the Father and Son for? and if thou canſt not conceive how Father, Son and Spirit are one God, the only living and true God, the great and only object of religious worſhip; does it from hence follow that the written word has not declared that it is ſo? as well mayeſt thou ſuppoſe there is no ſuch thing as the light of the Sun, becauſe when it ſhineth the owl can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee to fly. Is thy underſtanding the meaſure what deity is, or can be, or do? ſo far from it that it is very plain it is not ſufficient at all times to give the true ſenſe and meaning of a paſſage of the written word. Strange indeed! that a doctor of divinity ſhould over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look the primary genuine obvious ſenſe of the text he diſcourſes from: and yet apprehend thou muſt own that this is thy caſe, if thou wilt compare <hi>Micah</hi> v. 5. and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> ii 14. with the text. Is it not plain as any thing can poſſibly be that the prophet by peace has a view to the perſon of the Meſſiah, and intends to put them in mind of this: that this illuſtrious and truly divine perſonage would give a glory, an ornament, a ſplendor to the ſecond temple, or latter houſe incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably ſuperior to all the magnificence and grandeur of the former houſe. As to the truth and propriety of this I leave. But that this is the intention of Hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gai is as evident as the meridian ſun. How aſtoniſhing then that this ſhould eſcape thy penetrating eye: that the ſtreams ſhould engage all thy attention and the fountain be wholly ever-look'd.</p>

I would adviſe thee whenever thou publiſheſt again to follow the example of honeſt <hi>George Whitfield:</hi> look back on what thou haſt written, and own and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge thy miſtakes, be as frank, open and explicit in thy retractions, as thou haſt been raſh in thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on men much better than thy ſelf. Carry lower ſail, or old and artful as thou art, thou wilt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſplit againſt a rock, and ſo make a dreadful ſhipwreck of Faith whatever becomes of thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Let modeſty, honeſty, ſincerity be of thy council, and let craft, deſign, and guile be baniſhed by thee for ever. But if thou and thy friends are really determin'd to keep your ſelves clear from all principles and tenets whatſoever, for ſo you muſt if you will have no party principles or tenets, then let me adviſe thee to lay aſide thy pen and write no more: perplex thy ſelf and diſtreſs others no longer, but come into our fold to which thou ſo rationally belongeſt: and where thou mayeſt often be in the moſt pleaſing and rapturous manner, entertained with the moſt profound ſilence. In the mean while farewell and ſhow thy candid, catholic, charitable ſpirit, by loving and eſteeming</p>

            <head>POSTSCRIPT. A SHORT DIALOGUE between Mr. TIMOTHY TELL-TRUTH and OBADIAH FRIENDLY.</head>

               <speaker>Obadiah.</speaker>
               <p>PRAY Neighbour <hi>Timothy</hi> haſt thou ſeen the friendly Epiſtle to Neighbour <hi>John Taylor,</hi> in which he is invited to come among us <hi>Quakers?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Timothy.</speaker>
               <p>I have juſt been reading it over, and an odd Medley it is; for the Man is ſometimes ſo low and gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veling, ſo mean and weak in his Senſe and Sentiments, that one can ſcarce have Patience to read any further: At other Times he is ſo ſeverely ſatyrical, that one cannot help going through with it, becauſe Partiality itſelf muſt confeſs that the Satyr is as juſt as it is poinant.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Obad.</speaker>
               <p>Thou ſayeſt juſt; but I hope thou doſt not mean that his Satyr on us <hi>Quakers</hi> is as juſt as on our worthy Friend <hi>J. Taylor;</hi> for have we ever refuſed to be called Chriſtians, or do we diſclaim a Right to the Chriſtian Name, as he ſeems to inſinuate? Surely if we believe in the Chriſt within, the Light which hath lightened every Man that hath come into the World, from <hi>Adam</hi> the firſt Man down to the preſent Day, we may call our ſelves Chriſtians, and be deemed ſo by others as well as any People whatſoever.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>I will promiſe you that I will not diſpute that Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with you, yet I think it is very plain your Friend <hi>Adam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> regards himſelf and his Friends as Deiſts, and his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour <hi>Taylor</hi> as little otherwiſe, and I will freely declare to you, as you put me on this Converſation, that I have long thought that your Principles and his equally deiſtical &amp; popiſh.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Obad.</speaker>
               <p>Prithee now, Friend <hi>Timothy,</hi> do not call <hi>M. Adam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> my Friend, he is no more my Friend than he is thine, for it is very plain he is no <hi>Quaker,</hi> nor does he ſeem to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand either our Scheme or Friend <hi>Taylor</hi>'s.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>Whether he is a <hi>Quaker</hi> or no I think he has ſaid nothing but what many <hi>Quakers,</hi> if they would ſpeak out, and ſpeak honeſtly, would ſay too; and, if I gueſs right, he knows your Scheme and your Friend <hi>Taylor</hi>'s too, rather better than you chuſe he ſhould, if you have any Scheme at all.</p>

               <speaker>Obad.</speaker>
               <p>Any Scheme at all, Neighbour! Why what do'ſt mean by that? Do'ſt queſtion whether we have any Scheme? Whether Friend <hi>Taylor</hi> has any Scheme too? Why thee talk'ſt ſtrangely now! Why every body has got ſome Scheme; even Satan hath his Scheme both of Principles and Conduct; but why doſt thou queſtion whether we have any Scheme?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>I will tell you very plainly my Thoughts of this. When the ancient approv'd Scheme is caſt off, there are ſuch a Multiplicity of others invented, that the feeble Mind is preſently confuſed among the ſenſeleſs Jargon; yet deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined at all Events the old one ſhall not do, for no other Reaſon but becauſe it is old, therefore antiquated, unfit for Uſe; in this Situation the Man caſts in his Mind what is beſt to be done, and that he may appear ſomebody, he conſults every Scheme he can happen on; he takes a Piece here and a Piece there, ſome of this, ſome of that, and ſome of t'other; he compounds them together, and a glorious Mixture he has got; it is neither one thing nor another, while aiming at every Thing it is nothing; a Compound of every Thing, yet nothing to any Purpoſe; a ſcanty Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey-woolſey Garment, which will ſcarce cover the Naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Wearer.</p>

               <speaker>Obad.</speaker>
               <p>I am ſorry, Neighbour <hi>Timothy,</hi> to hear thee talk at this rate, thou doſt not uſe to be ſo cenſorious; and I am afraid, as thou haſt been reading the friendly Epiſtle, thou art ſomewhat leavened with the ſame Leaven which runs through that unintelligible Medley.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>Indeed you are quite miſtaken; for I was of the ſame Mind long before I ſaw that; yet I am free to own to you that has abundantly confirmed to me what I thought before; and I fully believe that you and the new-ſcheme Men have no Scheme at all, or ſuch as is juſt like none.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Obad.</speaker>
               <p>New-ſcheme-men! Pray who or what are they? that thou conecteſt them and us together! I have often heard of them and heartily wiſh I knew what Account to make of them. As thou haſt mentioned them, I wiſh thou wouldſt ſatisfy me about them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>Depend on it my good Neighbour, any Thing I can give you Intelligence of, or acquaint you with, I ſhall be very ready to do to the utmoſt of my Power, and I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the ſame from you.</p>

               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>You want to know who or what the new Scheme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are: As to who, I am not ſo well acquainted with the Inhabitants of the Earth as to point out one in a Thouſand: Doubtleſs your Friend <hi>Taylor</hi> is one of the chief; at leaſt he would have it thought that what he has advanced is new: Witneſs what he ſays in the 6th Page of one of his Pamphlets, viz. <q>When I firſt ſaw theſe Things I did not know that any one Perſon in the World had diſcover'd them beſide myſelf.</q> And leſt any body elſe in his way ſhould be wiſer than himſelf, if I am not miſinform'd, it has been his Advice to young Miniſters not to conſult the old Divines, but rather the Moderns. And indeed had he conſulted the old Writers, he muſt have found thoſe very Things ſolidly confuted which he has the Vanity to palm upon the World as quite new: And thus his Ignorance or want of reading muſt be his Apology for troubling the World with his Dreams.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Obad.</speaker>
               <p>Why <hi>Timothy,</hi> if thou doſt not take Care, thou wilt be as unmannerly &amp; ſcurrilous as <hi>M. Adamſon:</hi> Surely thee ſhouldſt conſider that our Friend <hi>Taylor</hi> in a worthy Citizen, a venerable old Man, and therefore not to be treated with Contempt.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>I have often heard this remark'd, and poſſibly there may be ſome Juſtice in it; but then I think your Friend <hi>Taylor</hi> himſelf has pav'd the Way for it, in treating the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Aſſembly of Divines in the manner he has done; ſo that he is only ſerv'd as he has ſerv'd others by far his Superiors.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Obad.</speaker>
               <p>But what are the new Scheme-men there is ſo much talk about? What are they doing of? What are they after?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>I believe they don't know themſelves, therefore I can give you but a very imperfect Account of them: I know but of one thing wherein they are all agreed; and that is, to treat with Contempt and Diſgrace the Great Author of the Chriſtian Religion; to blaſpheme the holy Name whereby Chriſtians are called. The Monthly Reviewers are notorious Inſtances of this ſort. With them, who ever writes any thing againſt Jeſus Chriſt, is a moſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd, accurate Writer, a Man of very great Sagacity and deep Learning, of incomparable Abilities and refin'd Senſe, extremely judicious and preciſely diſcerning: While who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever writes any thing in Honour of the divine Saviour, is
