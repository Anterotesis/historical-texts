         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>A Diſeaſe of a venal Majority in the great council of the nation, may be truly called a mortification in the body politic. This deſperate caſe requires a deſperate remedy. A pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotic King would neither delay, nor fear the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication. Its ſucceſs depends upon the hand that operates. The operation of a wholeſome and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutary deſolution has been wiſely inſtruſted by our conſiderate anceſtors to the ſovereign. The exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this great prerogative was petitioned for, with the greateſt reaſon, during the tyranny and iniquities of the laſt venal parliament, by the firſt, the moſt loyal, and reſpectable metropolis in the univerſe, the city of London. It was petitioned for, and twice refuſed.</p>

               </gap>tion. If a tyrannic parliament ſtill perſiſts, a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triot King,</hi> (like an honeſt dictator) will diſſolve ſuch miſcreants.</p>
            <p>Thus corruption will be extinguiſhed, honeſt repreſentatives elected, and a good King enthroned in the hearts of a grateful and affectionate people, whom he has thus conſtitutionally protected from ſlavery and ruin. What, (ſays ſome miniſterial ſcribbler, a Johnſon perhaps) ſhall a King of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land detach himſelf from his Parliament? I anſwer Yes; if that Parliament is corrupt, wicked, and tyrannical; it is then no conſtitutional Parliament, but an illicit gang; nor is he conſtitutional King, but a daring and unthinking tyrant, who adheres to them. By ſo doing, he plainly ſhews that it is not his intention to protect, but to enſlave his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. That venerable body alone can be called a Parliament, who are known, according to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the word <hi>(parler le ment)</hi> to ſpeak their mind, to be above all human influence. Can this be ſaid of a ſervile, deteſtable, inſidious, unconſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutional majority, who came to the great council, with a mercenary gagg in their mouths, their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious names in the court calendar, and Lord Bute's (under the colour of Lord North's) inſtructions in their pockets? Our Kings, it is true, are parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Kings, but there is a wide difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a parliament and a cabal; between ſages convened, and voters hired, between free, conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutional ſtates, and ſervile, miniſterial dependents.</p>
            <p>When a Parliament is degenerated thus far, they looſe their honour, they ought to looſe their former name; they deſerve no farther confidence. They would find none, in a wiſe and good King. No
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:013990_0003_0F92590C495A2E28"/>Prince who is not under the ideocy, inſanity, or the worſt paſſions, could adhere to ſuch a junto. Such men are audacious in calling themſelves a Parliament. They no longer repreſent, but uſurp; they are not faithful ſervants, but aſſuming tyrants, they are not counſellors of the King, but traytors to the people. A great council, (or rather a great majority) compoſed of ſuch monſters, ſuch peſts of a community, cannot be ſaid either to regard, or to repreſent a people; their views and intereſts are different. The people ſue for protection, they for places; the people wiſh to ſupport the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, they to ſupply their luxury; the people are affected by the decay of commerce, they by the largeſſes of the miniſter.</p>
            <p>Can a patriotic King confide in, or co-operate with ſuch a mock-parliament? When we hear a King talk of ſteadily purſuing the advice of the great council of the nation, it muſt be taken for granted, that he knows and believes the majority of that council (whoſe votes are deciſive of the fate of this kingdom) to be incorrupt. Can ſuch faith as this be found in Iſrael? If not, a King of England may well be aſked, even by the meaneſt of his ſubjects, why he is wicked enough, or weak enough, to approve, ſanctify and confirm, the deſpotic acts, not of ſuch a parliament, but of ſuch a traiterous convention? Is it his duty in ſuch a caſe, to confide or to diſſolve? In ſuch a danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous criſis the conſtitution has given a judicial pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to Kings; they are bound to exerciſe that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, not for the deſtruction, but for the ſafety of the commonwealth. They are not to conſult the views, the wiſhes, the intereſts, or ſecurity of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:013990_0004_0F92590D07688BA0"/>or favourites, but the ſalvation of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Our laws, under which every king muſt ſubmit to reign, ſpeaks plainly to the ſovereign, in open, intelligible, rational terms, when it ſays, <hi>"Ceſſa regnare, ſi non vis judicare."</hi>
               <q>If you will not exerciſe thoſe judicial powers, with which the conſtitution has entruſted you, reſign your crown, you are no longer fit to reign over a free people.</q> The word <hi>(judicare)</hi> in the maxim abovementioned, extends not merely to the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a King's judicial powers in civil, or crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal caſes, (though this would be the falſe interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a Mansfield) but it muſt be taken in its largeſt, and moſt important ſenſe; it is allowed by every honeſt man, learned interpreter, to extend to the whole ſyſtem of the King's executive powers. In that large ſenſe it has ever been conſidered by ſuch political writers as Locke, Sidney, Acherly, and Nathaniel Bacon, who writes ſo admirably on government.</p>
            <p>This maxim is ſtrong, and pointed; it comes directly home to my preſent purpoſe, and opens a large field for no very favourable inferences at the preſent juncture. A King of England muſt not, cannot live for himſelf, (much leſs for his minions) but only for his people. I ſpeak an honeſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional truth, when I ſay that he muſt not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge, but toil. A King's revenues, magnificence, ſplendor, pomp, and grandeur, are not deſigned to emblazon him, but to do honour to his kingdom. All his glittering rays of Majeſty are reflected from the people. An Engliſh throne is like a Turkiſh Sopha, to be made the idle ſeat of ſlumber and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. It is erected for the exerciſe of mercy, truth,
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:013990_0005_0F92590DC41E13C0"/>and juſtice. Neither of theſe princely attributes is concerned in maintaining corruption, or repelling juſt ſuitors without redreſs; nay, with ignominious language and contempt. It is a King of England's duty to cleanſe the Augean ſtable. He is the Argus of the commonwealth; his eyes, his ears, his men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal powers, muſt all be open to his people, whilſt his royal paſſions are ſubdued. He can acquire neither honour nor ſecurity by an injudicious ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle with his ſubjects. Truth and liberty will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail. Tyrants and fools have been dethroned. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured ſubjects have triumphed and exulted in their ruin. Minions, and abandoned miniſters have been guarded to the ſcaffold; and corruption itſelf, tho' not to be diſſolved, may be at laſt extinguiſhed, in another glorious and neceſſary revolution.</p>
            <p>Theſe are leſſons which Engliſh princes ſhould be taught betimes in their minority. By theſe, even Kings themſelves, may profit in riper yeas. By theſe, the preſent obdurate, deluded ſovereign, whom heaven has not been pleaſed to bleſs with any great ſhare of natural diſcernment, may be taught to avoid theſe miſeries, which muſt attend his raſh and headſtrong perſeverance, his unjuſt and guilty confidence; his tyrannic pride, and an inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent contempt of that people, through whoſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and indulgence, he moſt unworthily holds the crown of England.</p>
