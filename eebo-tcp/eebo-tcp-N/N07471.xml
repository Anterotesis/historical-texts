            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>MY DEAR FRIEND,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHEN the great St. Paul, in his epiſtle to the Romans, had a mind to lay a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid foundation for the grand diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doctrines of the goſpel, I need not inform you, that, like a wiſe maſter-builder, he takes care to dig deep into the corruption of human nature; and, after having given us a lively portraiture of the univerſal depravity of the Gentile world, proceeds, in a moſt maſterly manner, to bring down the proud thoughts and high imaginations of the ſelf-righteous and formal Phariſees, by proving, to a demonſtration, that the Jewiſh profeſſors, notwithſtanding all their peculiar advantages of external revelation, circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, near affinity to Abraham, and ſuch like, were all equally included under ſin, were all equally guilty before God, had all equally fallen ſhort of his glory, conſequently were all upon an equal level with the reſt of mankind, and ſtood as much in need of the free grace of God in Chriſt Jeſus, and the ſanctifying operations of his Holy Spirit, as the moſt ſavage Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians or diſputing Greek. This was acting like the forerunner or harbinger of our bleſſed Lord: for
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:009539_0003_0F768C61EF19FFA8"/>
when he ſaw many of the Sadducees and Phariſees (the infidels and profeſſors of that age) coming to his baptiſm, diſregarding, as it were, the former, in a very pungent, and, what ſome would term, a very unpolite manner, he thus addreſſeth himſelf to the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: <q>O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to free from the wrath to come? And think not to ſay within yourſelves, We have Abraham for our father: for I ſay unto you, God is able of theſe ſtones to raiſe up children unto Abraham.</q> But why ſpeak I of acting like the forerunner? I ſhould rather have ſaid, this was imitating our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Lord himſelf, who, in his glorious and divine ſermon, (when, to uſe the words of the ſeraphic Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey, a mount was his pulpit, and the heavens were his ſounding-board), employs himſelf chiefly in detec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the falſe gloſſes and corrupt interpretations of the then maſters of Iſrael, withal adding this cutting aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>Unleſs your righteouſneſs exceeds the righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, ye ſhall in no caſe enter into the kingdom of heaven.</q>
            </p>
            <p>WHAT a pity is it, my dear friend, that our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern defenders of Chriſtianity, in their elaborate and undoubtedly well-meant treatiſes, have not been more ſtudious to copy after ſuch bright and unerring examples! Many of theſe I know you have read; and am perſuaded, out of your uſual candour, will do them ſo much juſtice as to acknowledge, that, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the out-works of religion, ſuch as clearing up the prophecies of the Old, and vindicating the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the New Teſtament, againſt the attacks of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels and Freethinkers, they have ſhewn themſelves, as far as bare human learning, added to external re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, can carry them, to be maſters of ſtrong rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, nervous language, and concluſive arguments. But then, as I have often heard you lament, one thing they ſeem to lack, <hi>viz.</hi> a deeper and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:009539_0004_0F768C628FC7BFC8"/>
knowledge of themſelves and Jeſus Chriſt. Hence it is, that when they come to touch upon the internals and vitals of Chriſtianity, they are quite grappled, and write ſo unguardedly of the all-power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful influences of the Holy Ghoſt, as to ſink us into a ſtate of downright formality; which, if the apoſtle Paul may be our judge, we had need as much to be cautioned againſt, as fanaticiſm, ſuperſtition, or infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity itſelf: For, in his ſecond epiſtle to Timothy, after giving us a dreadful account of the abounding of wicked men in the laſt perilous times, ſuch as lovers of their own ſelves, covetous, boaſters, proud, blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers, diſobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, truce-breakers, falſe accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, incontinent, fierce, deſpiſers of thoſe that are good, traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures more than lovers of God; he brings up the rear in this awful manner, having a form of godlineſs, but denying the power thereof,—from ſuch, ſays he, turn away;—for, to uſe the words of our Lord, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blicans and harlots enter into tne kingdom of God before them.</p>
            <p>SORRY am I to ſend you word, that a writer of this unhappy ſtamp now lies upon my table; a writer, who, although he intitles his book, <hi>The Offices and Operations of the Holy Ghoſt vindicated from the Inſuits of Infidelity and Abuſes of Fanaticiſm,</hi> yet, in his great zeal againſt the latter, and to the no ſmall encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the former, as far as perverted reaſon and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed ſophiſtry could carry him, hath, in effect, robbed the church of Chriſt of its promiſed Comforter, and thereby left us, upon whom the ends of the world are come, without any ſupernatural influence or divine operations whatſoever. Often have I heard you obſerve, that there never was an age in which the ſtewards of the myſteries of Chriſt were more loudly called upon to vindicate the offices and operations of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:009539_0005_0F768C6356568568"/>
the Holy Spirit than that wherein we live. And for my own part, I cannot help thinking, that the moſt accompliſh'd and duly qualified perſon in the univerſe, could he write or ſpeak ſo extenſively, that the whole world might hear or read him, could not poſſibly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his love to mankind, in general, and the church of God, which he hath purchaſed with his own blood, in particular, in a more neceſſary, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, and uſeful way, than by declaring, upon the houſe-top, that the Holy Ghoſt, like its almighty purchaſer, is the ſame to-day as he was yeſterday; that he is now, as well as formerly, in the uſe of all inſtituted means, appointed to convince the world of ſin, of righteouſneſs, and judgment; to lead them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all truth, by ſpiritually opening their underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, that they may underſtand the Scriptures; and to renew a clean heart and right ſpirit within them here, in order that they may be thereby prepared for the full enjoyment of a triune and ever-bleſſed God hereafter. This, you will judge, my dear friend, is what any one might have reaſonably expected to have met with in a book bearing ſuch a promiſing title. But, alas! how was I diſappointed! and how will you be equally ſurpriſed, when I tell you, that, upon peruſing the book itſelf, I found that the author, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of vindicating or aſſerting, rather denies and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicules the ſtanding and unalterable operations of the Holy Ghoſt. For, having ingeniouſly taken a great deal of learned pains againſt the inſinuations of Dr. Middleton, to prove that there once was a Holy Ghoſt; that he did once actually deſcend upon the apoſtles on the day of Pentecoſt; and further, that he did once inſpire the ſacred writers to ſettle the canon of Scripture; he then, in order to tear up ſuperſtition, and, what he calls, fanaticiſm, by the roots, takes infinitely greater pains, (as well he might, being a moſt arduous taſk indeed), to ſhew, that what true believers, in all ages, have always looked upon to be
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009539_0006_0F768C6418C844D0"/>
the ſtanding and ordinary operations of the Spirit, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>Such as manifeſt themſelves in grace and knowledge, and which adminiſter aid in ſpiritual diſtreſſes, are to be accounted and called miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, as much as thoſe which extended outwards, in the gifts of healing, and the relief of other cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal infirmities; and theſe miraculous powers being now, upon the perfect eſtabliſhment of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity, <hi>totally withdrawn,</hi> it conſequently muſt be ſuperſtitious and fanatical to look for, or pretend to be poſſeſſed of, any of thoſe operations which manifeſt themſelves in grace and knowledge, and which adminiſter aid in ſpiritual diſtreſſes.</q> Pages 75.82.83. octavo edition. Strange aſſertions theſe, you will ſay, for a vindicator of the offices and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Holy Ghoſt, againſt the inſults of infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and the abuſes of fanaticiſm! Alas! what could a <hi>Middleton</hi> ſay more? Nay, I could almoſt add, where hath he expreſsly ſaid ſo much? But if it be ſuperſtition to look for, if it be fanaticiſm to ſeek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and not reſt till we are actually and experimental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſeſſed of, the ſupernatural influences of the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Spirit, manifeſting themſelves in grace and divine knowledge, and affording aid in ſpiritual diſtreſſes; then may you and I, my dear friend, become more and more ſuperſtitious and fanatical every day: for I am perſuaded, that without ſuch divine manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as exceed the powers of humanity, were we to be ſigned with the ſign of the croſs, in baptiſm, a thouſand times over, we could never ſucceſsfully fight under its banner againſt ſin, the world, and the devil, and conſequently not ſo much as truly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence, much leſs continue to be, Chriſt's faithful ſervants and ſoldiers, even to the end of our lives.</p>
            <p>SURELY, was the apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to riſe from the dead, and read over, or hear of, ſuch ſtrange poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, his ſpirit, as once at <hi>Athens,</hi> would again be
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:009539_0007_0F768C659AF759D0"/>
ſtirred in him, to ſee a writer thus attempting to erect an altar for the worſhip of an unknown God. I ſay an unknown God. For how is it poſſible, in the very nature of the thing, for us, who are by nature carnal and ſold under ſin, ever to worſhip God, who is a ſpirit, in ſpirit and in truth, without ſome inward manifeſtations of grace and ſpiritual knowledge, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradded to the light of external revelation, to enable us ſo to do? For, to apply what this apoſtle obſerves upon a like occaſion, he is not a real Chriſtian who is only one outwardly; but he alone is a true Chriſtian, who is one inwardly, whoſe baptiſm is that of th<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> heart, in the ſpirit, and not merely of the water, whoſe praiſe is not of man, but of God. And yet (would you think it?) this writer is ſo unwary as to attempt to preſs this very apoſtle, that true aſſertor of the doctrine of grace, that genuine irrefragable vindicator of the offices and operations of the Holy Spirit, into his miſtaken ſervice. Never, I believe, were the ſaint and the ſcholar, the gentleman and the Chriſtian, more ſweetly blended together than in the character and writings of this favourite of heaven. How often, my dear friend, in our more retired mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, when converſing together concerning the live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oracles of God, have you called upon me to take notice of this truly great man's pertinent and powerful preaching before Felix the governor, as well as his inexpreſſibly polite and perſuaſive addreſs to King Agrippa? And how have you again and again read over to me, and made remarks upon, thoſe ſtriking images, and thoſe divine characteriſtics, which this accompliſhed maſter of human and divine rhetoric lays before us in the 13th chapter of his 1ſt epiſtle to the Corinthians, of that moſt excellent grace of charity or love of God? A grace ſo abſolutely neceſſary to the Chriſtian life, that without it, to uſe the inimita<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble language of this inſpired writer, <hi>though we had a miraculous faith ſo as to remove mountains, nay though
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:009539_0008_0F768C66B52EA790"/>
we ſhould give all our goods to feed the poor, and even our bodies to be burnt, it would profit us nothing.</hi> A grace, that never faileth, but a ſacred ſomething that we ſhall eternally remain poſſeſſed of, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing in, even when faith ſhall end in the viſion, and hope in the endleſs fruition of the ever-bleſſed God. Oh, my dear friend, how frequently have our hearts burnt within us, under the glowing warmth of ſuch an animating proſpect? And yet, incredible as it may ſeem to you, I aſſure you, that this very chapter is ſingled out by our hapleſs author, to prove that ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural manifeſtations of grace and knowledge of ſpiritual aids in ſpiritual diſtreſſes, were the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous gifts of the primitive church, and were totally withdrawn on its perfect eſtabliſhment. Surely a more pertinent one could not be ſelected out of the whole New Teſtament, to prove directly the contrary. For let any man impartially examine the glorious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable properties and concomitants of this divine grace and gift of charity, recorded in this chapter, and then make the leaſt doubt whether any perſon living can poſſibly be poſſeſſed of this moſt excellent gift, without thoſe very ſupernatural manifeſtations of grace and knowledge, and thoſe divine influences of the Holy Spirit exceeding the powers of humanity, which this unhappy writer would fain perſuade us are now abated or totally withdrawn. <hi>Charity</hi> (ſays our apoſtle) <hi>ſuffereth long, and is kind—Charity envieth not —Charity vaunteth not itſelf, is not puffed up—ſeeketh not her own—is not eaſily provoked—thinketh no evil—re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth—beareth all things — hopeth all things—endureth all things.</hi> Now, can human reaſon, with all its heights; can calm phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, with all its depths; or moral ſuaſion, with all its inſinuating arts; ſo much as pretend to kindle, much leſs to maintain and blow up into a ſettled habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual flame of holy fire, ſuch a ſpark as this in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man heart? Sooner might one attempt to extinguiſh

the moſt rapid and devouring flames, by reading a lecture upon the benefit of cold water, or reach out one's preſumptuous hand to create a new heaven and a new earth, than to dream of extinguiſhing thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate fiery paſſions of envy, ſelfiſhneſs, or malice, which this charity or love of God is here ſaid to mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate againſt; or to work or form the ſoul into any of thoſe divine tempers here ſpoken of, as the genuine effects and fruits of the love of God. No, my dear friend, theſe are flowers not to be gathered in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's garden. They are exotics; planted originally in heaven, and in the great work of the new birth, tranſplanted by the Holy Ghoſt, not only into the hearts of the firſt apoſtles or primitive Chriſtians, but into the hearts of all true believers, even to the end of the world. For doubtleſs of all ſuch St. Paul ſpeaks, when he ſays, <hi>Tribulation worketh patience, patience ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, experience hope, and hope maketh not aſhamed, becauſe the love of God is ſhed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghoſt which is given unto us.</hi> And hence, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, it is, that we were all in general lately directed, in one of the collects of our church, to pray to that Lord <q>who hath taught us, that all our doings with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out charity are nothing worth, that he would ſend the Holy Ghoſt, and pour into our hearts that moſt excellent gift of charity.</q> So that, according to our reformers, ſupernatural influence and manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of grace and knowledge are ſo far from being totally withdrawn, that they, in the end of this very collect, teach us to confeſs, that without them, or, which is the ſame, without the love of God poured into the heart by the Holy Ghoſt, <q>whoſoever liveth is counted dead before him.</q> But if we will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve our author, charity ſignifies little more than the outward eſtabliſhment of the Chriſtian church, and conſequently that the apoſtle means no more in this chapter than to ſhew us, <q>that prophecies, myſteries, knowledge,</q> (<hi>i. e.</hi> according to this writer, all

ſupernatural knowledge), <q>were to ceaſe when Chriſtianity arrived to a perfect eſtabliſhment.</q> Page 82.— Nay, ſcorning to tread in the ſteps of Whitby, Hammond, Burkit, and every conſiſtent ſpiritual expoſitor of holy writ, our new commentator, out of his paradoxical genius, labours to prove, that when the great apoſtle aſſerts, that charity never ſails, and therefore hath the preference over faith and hope, he means nothing leſs than to aſſert its eternal dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that conſequently his true meaning hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto eſcaped every unwary reader but himſelf. Pages 75, 6, 7. Conſcious, no doubt, of this ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity, and juſtly aware of its needing ſome apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, he very properly adds, page 82. that ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common interpretation <q>inſtructs the unwary reader with what caution and application he ſhould come to the ſtudy of that profound reaſoning with which all St. Paul's epiſtles abound.</q> And may I not, at leaſt with as great propriety, ſubjoin, that this may alſo inſtruct every unwary reader with what caution he ſhould come to the ſtudy of that profound reaſoning with which this treatiſe abounds? ſo very profound, that I believe it exceeds the power of humanity to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom its depths, ſo far as to draw out of it any true, conſiſtent interpretation of the apoſtle's reaſoning on this chapter at all.</p>
            <p>I might here add, my dear friend, ſome other ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimens of our author's manner of explaining Scripture by his human reaſon: for inſtance, "keeping our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unſpotted from the world," he ſays, page 157. ſignifies only <hi>our uſing the means of grace.</hi> And again when the apoſtle informs us, Epheſ. v. 9. that the, fruit of the Spirit is in all goodneſs, righteouſneſs, and truth, he tells us, that truth refers to <hi>Chriſtian doctrine,</hi> goodneſs to <hi>Chriſtian practice,</hi> and by righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs is meant <q>the conduct of the whole to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, and conſiſts in that equal gentleneſs of

Eph. v. 9.</note>;</q> with ſeveral ſuch like inſtances, which even the moſt unwary reader, without much ſtudy or application, may meet with ſcattered up and down this author's performance: but this would be too great a digreſſion: And indeed I ſhould not have dwelt ſo long even upon this extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary interpretation of the thirteenth chapter of the firſt epiſtle to the Corinthians, had not this writer himſelf called it this <hi>deciſive paſſage,</hi> and given it as his opinion, that this is the only expreſs declaration recorded in Scripture, p. 76. to prove, that all ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural knowledge or divine influence was to ceaſe, when Chriſtianity was perfectly eſtabliſhed, or the world arrived at a perfect Chriſtian ſtate. But every day's experience, nay, this author's very book, prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beyond all doubt, that Chriſtianity is not as yet thus perfectly eſtabliſhed, we may, at leaſt as yet, according to his own principles, expect divine mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations of grace and knowledge, and ſpiritual aids under ſpiritual diſtreſſes, without juſtly incurring the imputation either of ſuperſtition or fanaticiſm.</p>
            <p>BUT to proceed—However profound and intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible our author's comments may be, yet, when he comes to ſhew the reaſonableneſs and fitneſs of this thing, <hi>viz.</hi> an abatement or total withdrawing of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine influence in theſe laſt days, (and wo to the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an world if he ſucceeds in his unhallowed attempt), he ſpeaks intelligibly enough:—For thus writes our author.—<q>On the Spirit's firſt deſcent upon the apoſtles, he found their minds rude and uninform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſtrangers to all celeſtial knowledge, prejudiced
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:009539_0012_0F768C69B7139FE8"/>
in favour of a carnal law, and utterly averſe to the dictates of the everlaſting goſpel. The minds of theſe he illuminated, and, by degrees, led into all truths neceſſary for the profeſſors of the faith to know, or for the propagators of it to teach.</q>— True.—<q>Secondly, the nature and genius of the goſpel were ſo averſe to all the religious inſtitutions of the world, that the whole ſtrength of human prejudices was ſet in oppoſition to it.—To over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the obſtinacy and violence of thoſe preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices, nothing leſs than the power of the Holy One was ſufficient."</q>—Good.—<q>And, thirdly and laſtly, There was a time when the powers of this world were combined together for its deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. At ſuch a period nothing but ſuperior aid from above, could ſupport humanity in ſuſtaining ſo great a conflict as that which the holy martyrs encountered with joy and rapture, the horrors of death and torment."</q>—Excellent.—But what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows?—According to our author, <hi>Tempora mutantur, nos et mutamur in illis.</hi> 
               <q>But now, adds he, (and a dreadful <hi>but</hi> it is), the profeſſion of Chriſtianity is attended with eaſe and honour;</q> and we are now, it ſeems, ſo far from being <q>rude and uninformed, and utterly averſe to the dictates of the everlaſting goſpel, that whatever there may be of prejudice, it draws another way.— Conſequently, a rule of faith being now eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the conviction which the weight of human teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony, and the concluſions of human reaſon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

of the Holy Spirit to explain his own ;mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</q> Pages 85.86.87.88. This, you will ſay, my dear friend, is going pretty far. And, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ſuppoſing matters to be as this writer repreſents them to be, I do not ſee what need we have almoſt of any eſtabliſhed rule at all, at leaſt in reſpect to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, ſince corrupt nature is abundantly ſufficient of itſelf to help us to perſevere in a religion attended with eaſe and honour. And I verily believe, that the Deiſts throw aſide this rule of faith entirely, not barely on account of a deficiency in argument to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port its authenticity, but becauſe they daily ſee ſo many who profeſs to hold this eſtabliſhed ſelf-denying rule of faith with their lips, perſevering all their lives long in nothing elſe but an endleſs and inſatiable purſuit after worldly eaſe and honour. But what a total ignorance of human nature, and of the true unalterable genius of the everlaſting goſpel, doth our author's arguing diſcover? For ſuppoſing, my dear friend, that this or any other writer ſhould undertake to prove that the ancient Greeks and Romans were born with ſickly, diſordered, and crazy bodies, but that we, in modern days, being made of a firmer mould, and being bleſſed with the eſtabliſhed rules of Galen and Hippocrates, need now no further aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from any preſent phyſician, either to explain or apply thoſe rules to our preſent ails and corporeal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes, though we could not, without the help of ſome linguiſt ſuperior to ourſelves, ſo much as under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the language in which thoſe authors wrote: — Suppoſing, I ſay, any one was to take it into his head to write in this manner: Would he not be juſtly deemed a dreaming enthuſiaſt or real fanatic? And yet this would be juſt as rational as to inſinuate, with our author, that we, who are born in theſe laſt days, have leſs depravity in our natures, leſs enmity to, and leſs prejudice againſt the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and leſs need of the divine teachings of the Bleſſed Spirit
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:009539_0014_0F768C6AE89FC3D8"/>
to help us to underſtand the true ſpiritual meaning of the Holy Scriptures, than thoſe who were born in the firſt ages of the goſpel. For as it was formerly, ſo it is now, the natural man diſcerneth not the things of the Spirit. And why? Becauſe they can only be ſpiritually diſcerned. But when is it that we muſt believe this author? For, page 73. he talks of ſome of the <q>firſt Chriſtians, who were in the happy circumſtance of being found innocent, when they were led into the practice of all virtue by the Holy Spirit.</q> And what occaſion for that, if found in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent? But how innocent did the Holy Spirit find them? Doubtleſs juſt as innocent as it finds us, <hi>viz.</hi> conceived and born in ſin; having in our fleſh, <hi>i. e.</hi> our depraved nature, no good thing; bringing into the world with us a corruption which renders us lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God's wrath and eternal damnation; with a carnal mind, which is enmity againſt God, and a heart, the thoughts and imaginations of which are declared to be only evil, and that continually; and whoſe native and habitual language, though born and educated under a Chriſtian diſpenſation, is identically the ſame as that of the Jews, <hi>viz. We will not have the Lord Jeſus to reign over us.</hi> This, and this alone, my dear friend, is all the innocence that every man, naturally engendered of the offspring of <hi>Adam,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther born in the antediluvian, patriarchal, Moſaic, apoſtolic, or preſent age, can boaſt of. And if this be matter of fact, (and who that knows himſelf can deny it?), it is ſo far from being ſuperſtitious or fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical to aſſert the abſolute neceſſity of a divine influ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ence, or a power ſuperior to that of humanity, that it is a moſt irrefragable argument for its continuance without the leaſt abatement or withdrawing whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Since daily experience proves, that, without ſuch a power, our underſtandings cannot be enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, our wills ſubdued, our prejudices and enmity overcome, our affections turned into a proper channel,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:009539_0015_0F768C6B9F728598"/>
or, in ſhort, any one individual of the apoſtate fallen race of Adam be ſaved. And if ſo, what becomes of our author's arguments to ſhew the fitneſs of an abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or total withdrawing of divine influence in theſe goſpel-days? Might he not, with as great conſiſtency, have undertaken to ſhew the fitneſs of an abatement or total withdrawing of the irradiating light and geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al warmth of the natural ſun? For, as the earth, on which we tread, ſtands as much in need now of the abiding influence of the genial rays of that great lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary in order to produce, keep up, and complete the vegetative life in graſs, fruits, plants, and flowers, as it did in any preceding age of the world; ſo our earthly hearts do now, and always will, ſtand in as much need of the quickening, enlivening, transform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing influences of the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sun of righteouſneſs, as the hearts of the firſt apoſtles; if not to make us preachers, yet to make us Chriſtians, <hi>viz.</hi> by beginning, carrying on, and completing that holineſs in the heart and life of every believer in every age, without which no man living ſhall ſee the Lord. And the Scriptures are ſo far from encouraging us to plead for a diminution of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine influence in theſe laſt days of the goſpel, becauſe an external rule of faith is thereby eſtabliſhed, that, on the contrary, we are encouraged by this very eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed rule to expect, hope, long, and pray, for larger and more extenſive ſhowers of divine influence than any former age hath ever yet experienced. For, are we not therein taught to pray, that we may be filled with all the fulneſs of God, and to wait for a glorious epocha, when the earth ſhall be filled with the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the ſeas? Do not all the ſaints on earth, and all the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect in heaven, nay, all the angels and archangels about the throne of the moſt high God, night and day, join in this united cry, Lord Jeſus, thus let thy kingdom come.</p>

Mr. John Weſley's Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals; and, to uſe his own ſimile upon another occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, by a kind of Egyptian huſbandry, draws toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whole droves of obſcene animals, of his own for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, who ruſh in furiouſly, and then trample the Journals, and this ſect, already every where ſpoken againſt, under their feet.—In reading this part of his work, I could not help thinking of the Papiſts dreſſing John Huſs in a cap of painted devils, before they delivered him up to the ſecular arm.—For our author calls the Rev. Mr. John Weſley—paltry mimic—ſpiritual empiric—ſpiritual martialiſt—meek apoſtle—new adventurer.—The Methodiſts, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to him, are—modern apoſtles—the ſaints— new miſſionaries—illuminated doctors—this ſect of fanatics.—Methodiſm itſelf is modern ſaintſhip: —Mr. Law begat it, and Count Zinzendorf rocked the cradle—and the devil himſelf is man-midwife to their new birth.— And yet this is the man, my dear friend, who in his preface to this very book lays it down as an invariable maxim, <q>That truth is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo groſsly injured, or its advocates ſo diſhon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oured, as when they employ the fooliſh arts of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry, buffoonery, and perſonal abuſe in its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</q> By thy own pen ſhalt thou be tried, thou hapleſs, miſtaken advocate of the Chriſtian cauſe.— Nay, not content with dreſſing up this meek apoſtle,

this ſpiritual empiric, theſe new miſſionaries, in bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſkins, in order to throw them out to be baited by an ill natured world, he proceeds to rake up the very aſhes of the dead; and, like the witch of Endor, as far as in him lies, attempts to bring up and diſquiet the ghoſts of one of the moſt venerable ſets of men that ever lived upon the earth; I mean the good Old Puritans.—<q>For theſe, ſays our author, who now go under the name of <hi>Methodiſts,</hi> in the days of our forefathers, under the firm reign of Queen Elizabeth, were called <hi>Preciſians</hi>;—but then, as a precious metal which had undergone its trial in the fire and left all its droſs, the ſect, with great propriety, changed its name, (a very likely thing to give themſelves a nickname, indeed), from Preciſian to <hi>Puritan.</hi>—Then in the weak and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted times of Charles I. it ventured to throw off the maſk, and under the new name of <hi>Independent,</hi> became the chief agent of all the dreadful diſorders which terminated that unhappy reign.</q>—So that, according to this author's heraidic, genealogical fic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <q>Methodiſm is the younger daughter to Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency, and now a Methodiſt is an apoſtolic In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent; (God grant he may always deſerve ſuch a glorious appellation); but an Independent was then a Mahometan Methodiſt.</q> Pag. 142.113.144.— What!— an Independent a Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan Methodiſt?—What!—the learned Dr. Owen, the great Dr. Goodwin, the amiable Mr. Howe, and thoſe glorious worthies who firſt planted the New-England churches, Mahometan Methodiſts? Would to God, that not only this writer, but all who now profeſs to preach Chriſt in this land, were not only almoſt, but altogether ſuch Mahometan Methodiſts, in reſpect to the doctrine of divine influence, as they were!

influence, manifeſting itſelf in grace and knowledge, is miraculous, and therefore to ceaſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a perfect eſtabliſhment. —What ſays?—But I check myſelf;—for the time would fail me was I to urge all thoſe quotations that might be produced out of the Articles, Homilies, and Public Offices, to confront and invalidate the whole tenor and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Lordſhip's performance. But how it is conſiſtent with that wiſdom which is from above, (and by which his Lordſhip attempts to arraign, try, and condemn the Rev. Mr. John Weſley, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to, and make uſe of, public offices in the church, and then as publicly deny and contradict them in the preſs, I leave to his Lordſhip's more calm and deliberate conſideration. Sure I am, if weighed in the ſame balance, his Lordſhip would be found as equally wanting at leaſt. And indeed, during the whole trial, I could ſcarcely refrain breaking out into the language of the eunuch of Queen Candace to Philip the evangeliſt, <hi>Speaketh the prophet this of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or of ſome other man?</hi>—I hope, my dear friend, you know me better than to ſuſpect I thus retort upon his Lordſhip, in order to throw duſt in your eyes to prevent your ſeeing what his Lordſhip may juſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept againſt in the conduct of the Methodiſts in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, or in the Journals of the Rev. Mr. John Weſley in particular. Whatever that indefatigable labourer may think of his, you know I have long ſince public<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledged, that there were, and doubtleſs, though now ſent forth in a more correct attire, there are yet, many exceptionable paſſages in my Journals. And I hope it will be one of the conſtant employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of my declining years, to humble myſelf daily before the moſt high God, for the innumerable mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of corruption which have blended themſelves with my feeble, but, I truſt, ſincere endeavours, whether from the preſs or pulpit, to promote the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer's glory, and the eternal welfare of precious
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:009539_0022_0F768C71A9013528"/>
and immortal ſouls. And I aſſure you, that if his Lordſhip had contented himſelf with pointing out, or even ridiculing any ſuch blemiſhes or imprudences, or yet ſtill more important miſtakes, in my own, or any of the Methodiſts conduct or performances, I ſhould have ſtood entirely ſilent. But when I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved his Lordſhip, through almoſt his whole book, not only wantonly throwing about the arrows and firebrands of ſcurrility, buffoonery, and perſonal abuſe, but, at the ſame time, on account of ſome unguarded expreſſions and indiſcretions of a particular ſet of honeſt, though fallible men, taking occaſion to wound, vilify, and totally deny the all-powerful, ſtanding operations of the Bleſſed Spirit, by which alone his Lordſhip or any other man living can be ſanctified and ſealed to the day of eternal redemption, I muſt own that I was conſtrained to vent myſelf to you, as a dear and intimate friend, in the manner I have done. Make what uſe of it you pleaſe. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps hereafter I may trouble you with ſome further remarks. At preſent, you know, I am on the load to Scotland, in order to embark for America. And therefore I would now only obſerve to you further, that the unguarded-unwary method made uſe of by his Lordſhip to ſtop, will rather ſerve to increaſe and eſtabliſh what he is pleaſed to term a ſect of fanatics. The more judicious Biſhop Burnet, as I heard an acute advocate once obſerve, in the general aſſembly of the church of Scotland, preſcribed a much better (and indeed the only effectual and truly apoſtolic) way to ſtop the progreſs of the Puritan miniſters, when complained againſt to his Lordſhip, by ſome of his clergy, for breaking into and preaching in their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial charges: <hi>Out-live, out-labour, out-preach them,</hi> ſaid his Lordſhip. And that the Reverend Mr. John Weſley himſelf (that famed leader of the Methodiſts) and every Methodiſt preacher in <hi>England</hi> may be thus <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
