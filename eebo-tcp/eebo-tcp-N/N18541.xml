            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AS the miniſtry of the goſpel is a chief means of the ſalvation of mankind, it is of great importance for all to have right ideas about the call and characters of the miniſters of Chriſt. Yet miſtakes about theſe things are exceeding com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in the world. And though men generally complain of theſe evils, yet how few make the holy ſcriptures their only rule to guard againſt them? Many exclaim againſt old <hi>traditious,</hi> who are far from being clear of them themſelves; and <hi>oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of ſcience, falſely ſo called,</hi> hath filled the world with <hi>perverſe diſputings.</hi> And we have abundant evidence, that <hi>the love of money is the root of all evil.</hi> 1 Tim. vi. 5, 10, 20. But as perſecution hath not the ſword of the magiſtrate in America to enforce it, <hi>oppoſition of knowledge</hi> cannot be ſo fierce here, as in other countries.</p>
            <p>When the enſuing diſcourſe was firſt publiſhed, in the year 1754, great violence was exerciſed againſt all miniſters who were not educated for that work, and ſupported by worldly power. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the multitude of publications ſince, I have never ſeen one upon the nature and neceſſity of an internal call from God to preach his goſpel. And as this diſcourſe hath lately been frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:024062_0004_0FC2FD5D81A77258"/>after, I have thought proper to reviſe it, and ſend it again into the world. For God ſays, <hi>If any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his.</hi> And if this be eſſential to the character of a Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, how much more for a miniſter of Chriſt? And he ſays, <hi>Ye ſhall know them by their fruits.</hi> Therefore an attempt is here alſo made to explain thoſe fruits, as they are plainly deſcribed in the holy ſcriptures. And each perſon has an equal right to judge for himſelf about ſoul-guides, as he can anſwer it to God, who will finally reward every man according to his works: when no deceitful arts can avail with any teacher or hearer. And deceit and cruelty, under religious pretences, hath brought forth the infidelity and contempt of all vital and practical religion, which ſo much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails in our day. Men have been very careful in civil governments, to attribute all the miſchiefs therein to inferior officers, or to the people, and not to the HEAD of the government; but in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous matters, all the hypocriſies and villanies that have appeared among thoſe who have profeſſed to believe the Chriſtian religion, have been turned againſt the authority of Chriſt in his church. But the time is nigh, when the deaf ſhall hear the words of God's book, and the eyes of the blind ſhall ſee out of obſcurity, and out of darkneſs; the meek alſo ſhall increaſe their joy in the Lord, and the poor among men ſhall rejoice in the holy One of Iſrael.</p>

            <head>THE NATURE AND NECESSITY <hi>OF AN</hi> Internal Call to preach the Goſpel.</head>
            <p>THE public preaching of the goſpel, is as plain an ordinance of God as any one that he ever inſtituted; and the importance of it is acknowledged by all men who profeſs any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the truth of Chriſtianity. But how men are called into that work, and how others may know them, ſo as to obey the goſpel, and avoid deceivers, are queſtions which have filled the world with controverſy. And as true believers are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the beſt ſubjects of civil government, deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful men have held them in bondage, ever ſince the ſword of the magiſtrate was brought into the church of Chriſt. Miniſters had aſſumed the place of lawgivers and judges for the church, before Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine came to the throne; and it is ſaid, "He confirmed with his royal authority, the canons and determinations of the biſhops, which they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed in their conſiſtories, that ſo the princes of other nations might not abrogate their decrees. For the judgment of the <hi>prieſthood</hi> in eccleſiaſtical matters, is to be preferred before the opinion of a ſecular judge." <note n="*" place="bottom">Euſebius's life of Conſtantine, p. 61.</note> And from that day to this, the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:024062_0006_0FC2FD6E5B351680"/>prejudices of natural affection, education, honor, gain, and ſelf-righteouſneſs, have all conſpired a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt allowing each one to anſwer a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience towards God in all the affairs of his worſhip. The ſword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, gave a deadly wound to the power of the beaſt, in the REFORMATION two hundred and ſeventy-five years ago; but that deadly wound was ſoon heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo that deceit and cruelty, which is the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the devil and his children, hath been carried as far round the world by Proteſtants, as ever it was by Papiſts. And the <hi>prieſthood</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, and of his children, is as much diſregarded under the one as the other of theſe names. For the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired apoſtle Peter ſays to every true believer, Seeing ye have purified your ſouls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren; ſee that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently: being born again, not of corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible ſeed, but incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth forever.—And this is the word which by the goſpel is preached unto you. Wherefore, laying aſide all malice, and all guile, and hypocriſies, and envies, and all evil-ſpeakings, as new-born babes, deſire the ſincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby; if ſo be ye have taſted that the Lord is gracious: to whom com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as unto a living ſtone, diſallowed indeed of men, but choſen of God, and precious; ye alſo, as lively ſtones, are built up a ſpiritual houſe, an <hi>holy prieſthood,</hi> to offer up ſpiritual ſacrifices, acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt.—Ye are a choſen genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a <hi>royal prieſthood,</hi> an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye ſhould ſhew forth the praiſes of him who hath called you out of darkneſs into his marvellous light. 1 Peter i. 22—25. ii. 1—9.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:024062_0007_0FC2FD6F617DF598"/>
Every perſon who is born again, is a prieſt unto God, and is required daily to offer up ſpiritual ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices to God by Jeſus Chriſt. And theſe are the only prieſthood, and holy nation, that he hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heaven. And our Lord ſays, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye ſhall not ſee the kingdom of heaven. Whoſoever, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſhall humble himſelf as this little child, the ſame is the greateſt in the kingdom of heaven. Mat. xviii. 3, 4. And it is out of ſuch little child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, that the Son of God calls forth his miniſters, who are never called prieſts in the new-teſtament, in diſtinction from the brethren. And the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition that I mean to prove is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That every true miniſter of Chriſt, is called into that work by the ſame Holy Spirit, that all his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and apoſtles were of old.</hi> And I ſhall endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to explain this propoſition, and then prove it, and vindicate it againſt various objections. In explaining of it, I would obſerve, that all the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the oracles of God, were endued by him with power to work miracles to confirm the words which they publiſhed; which power is not given to his ordinary miniſters, among people who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to own the truth of revelation. After the reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urrection of our Lord, he appeared unto the <hi>eleven,</hi> and ſaid unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the goſpel to every creature. He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved; but he that believeth not ſhall be damned.—And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them, and <hi>confirming the word with ſigns following.</hi> Amen. Mark xvi. 14—20. But ſince the ſacred volume is compleated, and miracles are ceaſed, the miniſters of Chriſt have not that power from him: Though the <hi>man of ſin</hi> was advanced
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:024062_0008_0FC2FD7607375210"/>in the <hi>temple of God,</hi> which is his church, with <hi>powers, and ſigns, and lying wonders,</hi> and with <hi>all deceivableneſs of unrighteouſneſs,</hi> in them that periſh; becauſe they received not the <hi>love of the truth that they might be ſaved.</hi> 2 Theſſ. ii. 3—10. <hi>Faith which worketh by love,</hi> is the only thing which availeth any ſoul before God. Gal. v. 6. And, <hi>ſpeaking the truth in love,</hi> is the only way of grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up into Chriſt, the HEAD of the church. Eph. iv. 15. Who ſays, <hi>If ye keep my commandments, ye ſhall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's commandments, and abide in his love.</hi> John xv. 10. And to guard againſt <hi>mockers,</hi> who walk after their own <hi>ungodly luſts,</hi> the command to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers is, <hi>Keep yourſelves in the love of God, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the mercy of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt unto eternal life.</hi> Jude 18—21. Obedience to the revealed will of God, is the only way of ſafety and happineſs, both for miniſters and people. It was equally ſo with his church before the Son of God gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a <hi>ſacrifice</hi> for us, as it is ſince, and will be to the end of the world. And that every true mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Chriſt, is internally called into that work by the ſame Spirit that the prophets and apoſtles were, I think is evident, from the following conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">I. They come in the name of the eternal JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HOVAH, as really as any of his ſervants did of old. Moſes was to ſay, I AM hath ſent me unto you. Exod. iii. 14. And Ezekiel was to ſay, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God,</hi> whether they would hear, or whether they would forbear. Ezek. ii. 4, 5. So Jeſus ſays, Before Abraham was, I AM. John viii. 58. Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them <hi>in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> teaching them to obſerve all things whatſoever <hi>I have commanded you: and lo,</hi> I AM
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:024062_0009_0FC2FD776CFCB558"/>
               <hi>with you alway even unto the end of the world.</hi> Amen. Mat. xxviii. 19, 20. Thus every true miniſter of Chriſt, acts in the name of the great I AM; and therefore muſt be called into the work by his Spirit.</p>
            <p n="11">II. God is as near to his church as ever he was, and therefore no men can be inveſted with power in his room, to call forth his miniſters. The judges, prieſts, and kings in Iſrael, were only to execute the laws of God, which he revealed by his prophets. And God ſaid, the man that will do <hi>preſumptuouſly,</hi> and will not hearken unto the prieſt (that ſtandeth to miniſter there before the Lord thy God) or unto the judge, even that man ſhall die; and thou ſhalt put away the evil from Iſrael. And if they would ſet up a king over them, he muſt be firſt <hi>choſen</hi> by God, from among their <hi>bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren;</hi> and he was to read in the law of God all the days of his life, that his heart might not be lifted up above his <hi>brethren.</hi> Deut. xvii. 11—20. And Jeſus is the only antetype of Moſes, Aaron, and David. Acts ii. 22—36. iii. 22, 23. Heb. v. 1—6. And he ſays to his church, Verily, I ſay unto you, Whatſoever ye ſhall bind on earth, ſhall be bound in heaven; and whatſoever ye ſhall looſe on earth, ſhall be looſed in heaven. Again I ſay unto you, That if two of you ſhall agree on earth, as touching any thing that they ſhall aſk, it ſhall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven. For where two or three are gathered together <hi>in my name, there am I in the midſt of them.</hi> Mat. xviii. 15—20. To meet <hi>in his name,</hi> is to meet according to <hi>his commandment,</hi> with which his <hi>promiſe</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected, <hi>Lo I am with you alway even unto the end of the world.</hi> And as he is always with the faithful, he as really calls forth his miniſters, by his word and Spirit, as he ever did in ancient times.</p>

III. The children of men, yea, the children of God, are as incapable to determine who ſhall be his miniſters, as they were formerly. And an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired apoſtle ſays, After that, in the wiſdom of God, the world by wiſdom knew not God, it pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God by the fooliſhneſs of preaching to ſave them that believe.—God hath <hi>choſen</hi> the fooliſh things of the world, to confound the wiſe; and God hath <hi>choſen</hi> the weak things of the world, to confound the things that are mighty; and baſe things of the world, and things which are deſpiſed, hath God <hi>choſen,</hi> yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are; that no fleſh ſhould glory in his preſence. 1 Cor. i. 21—29. This he now doth, both as to his children and his miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as much as he did in the apoſtolic age. And men muſt ſhut their eyes againſt the light of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as well as the light of revelation, not to ſee this in his late wonderful works among the nations. And yet many of the children of God are ſtill diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting, who ſhall be the greateſt. The apoſtle John, under that diſpoſition, once ſaid, Maſter, we ſaw one caſting out devils in thy name, and he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not <hi>us;</hi> and we forbad him, becauſe he followeth not <hi>us.</hi> But Jeſus ſaid, Forbid him not; for there is no man which ſhall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly ſpeak evil of me. Mark ix. 33—39. The <hi>line of things,</hi> which is made ready to our hand, ſays, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord. For not he that commendeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth. 2 Cor. x. 16—18. This <hi>line</hi> is drawn by inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the word of God. But many teachers have taken this paſſage to prove, that all men within <hi>lines</hi> which men have drawn, ought to be forced to ſupport ſuch teachers as are choſen by the rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:024062_0011_0FC2FD869C9250D8"/>party therein; and alſo, that ſuch teachers may forbid all others to preach the goſpel within thoſe <hi>lines,</hi> who pleaſe them not. Though the great apoſtle of the Gentiles ſays, <hi>If I yet pleaſed men, I ſhould not be the ſervant of Chriſt.</hi> And he ſays, If any man preach any other <hi>goſpel</hi> unto you, let him be <hi>accurſed.</hi> Gal. i. 7—10.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The work of the goſpel miniſtry is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially as great as ever it was; therefore men are to be called into it by the ſame holy Spirit that all the ſervants of God were of old. The church of Chriſt is built upon the <hi>foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the chief corner Stone.</hi> Eph. ii. 20. The Jews who built upon their <hi>own righteouſneſs, were in covenant with death, and with hell were at agreement.</hi> Iſaiah xxviii. 15, 16. Rom. ix. 32, 33. <hi>For to be carnally minded is death; but to be ſpiritually minded, is life and peace: becauſe the carnal mind is enmity againſt God; for it is not ſubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</hi> Rom. viii. 6, 7. Loving him with all our powers, and loving our neighbours as ourſelves, is the <hi>one thing needful.</hi> Luke x. 27, 28, 42. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to love the world, or our own righteouſneſs, above God, is <hi>enmity</hi> againſt him. And he ſays, <hi>The friendſhip of the world is enmity with God.</hi> Jam. iv. 4. And God ſaid to Ezekiel, I have ſet thee a <hi>watchman</hi> unto the houſe of Iſrael; therefore thou ſhalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me. Ezek. xxxiii. 7. So he ſays by an inſpired apoſtle, Obey them that have the rule over you, and ſubmit yourſelves; for they <hi>watch for your ſouls,</hi> as they that muſt give account: that they may do it with joy, and not with grief; for that is unprofitable for you. Pray for us; for we truſt we have a good conſcience, in all
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:024062_0012_0FC2FD87F171BAE8"/>things willing to live <hi>honeſtly.</hi> Heb. xiii. 17, 18. But how can miniſters live <hi>honeſtly,</hi> if their <hi>truſt</hi> is in an <hi>arm of fleſh,</hi> inſtead of the eternal JEHOVAH! for a <hi>curſe</hi> of <hi>blindneſs</hi> is upon all ſuch men. Jer. xvii. 5—8. Therefore the apoſtle Paul ſaid to the elders of Epheſus, I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men; for I have not ſhunned to declare unto you all the counſel of God. Take heed therefore unto your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to all the flock over the which the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> hath made you overſeers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchaſed with his own blood. For I know this, that after my departing ſhall grievous <hi>wolves</hi> enter in among you, not ſparing the flock. Alſo of your own ſelves ſhall men ariſe, ſpeaking <hi>perverſe things,</hi> to draw away diſciples after them. Therefore <hi>watch,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that by the ſpace of three years I ceaſed not to warn every one night and day with tears. And now brethren, I commend you to God, and to the <hi>word of his grace,</hi> which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are ſanctified. Acts xx. 26—32.</p>
            <p>Elders and overſeers or biſhops, are here called brethren, by one of the chiefeſt of the apoſtles; who informs them, that the Holy Ghoſt made them overſeers of the flock of God; whoſe power, and the word of his grace, was their ſufficient ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity againſt grievous wolves, and perverſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puters. Therefore, as every true miniſter of Chriſt, acts in the name of the ſame God that the prophets and apoſtles did; and he is as near to his church now as formerly; and men are as unable to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine who ſhall be his meſſengers as ever they were, and their work of watching for ſouls and feeding Chriſt's ſheep, is as great as ever, I conclude that
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:024062_0013_0FC2FD8EA98A9CF0"/>he as really calls them forth by his Spirit now as ever he did in the world. But how does he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form this great work? or how are any men now called to preach the goſpel? I anſwer,
<list>
                  <item>1. Our aſcended Lord, by the Holy Spirit, gives the church <hi>gifts for paſtors and teachers,</hi> as well as for all other purpoſes in his kingdom. The Lord gave the word, great was the company of thoſe that publiſhed it.—Thou haſt aſcended on high, thou haſt led captivity captive: thou haſt received <hi>gifts</hi> for men; yea, for the rebellious alſo, that the Lord God might dwell among them. And he ſays to his church, There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptiſm, one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all. Pſalm lxviii. 11, 18. Eph. iv. 4—10. By this heavenly influence, the natural capacities and human accompliſhments of believers are ſanctified, and they are prepared to fill up their place with duty and uſefulneſs, as much as every member of our natural body doth, under the direction of the head. And they who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for preachers of the goſpel, have ſpecial light given them, and the nature of revelation is opened with great ſweetneſs to their ſouls. Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah ſaid, Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing of mine heart. But he met with ſuch cruel treatment, for his faithfulneſs in his work, that he ſaid, I will not make mention of him, nor ſpeak any more in his name. But his word was in my heart as a burning fire ſhut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not ſtay. Jer. xv. 16. xx. 9. So God ſaid to Ezekiel, Son of man, eat that thou findeſt; eat this roll, and go
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:024062_0014_0FC2FD90357DD130"/>ſpeak unto the houſe of Iſrael. So I opened my mouth, and he cauſed me to eat the roll; and he ſaid unto me, Son of man, cauſe thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels, with this roll that I give thee. Then I did eat it, and it was in my mouth as honey for ſweetneſs. And he ſaid unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the houſe of Iſrael, and ſpeak with my words unto them. Ezek. iii. 1—4. Alſo, at the command of God, John took and eat the little book, and ſays, It was in my mouth ſweet as honey; and as ſoon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter. And he ſaid unto me, Thou muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings. Rev. x. 8—10. In all which, the ſweetneſs of God's word, and the bitterneſs of preaching it to a ſinful world, is plainly held forth.</item>
                  <item>2. A diſcovery of the worth of ſouls, and of the ſtate of the church, goes before a call to preach the goſpel to them. This is neceſſary in order for any to be faithful <hi>watchmen.</hi> Hence it is ſaid, When Jeſus ſaw the multitudes, he was moved with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on them, becauſe they fainted, and were ſcattered abroad, as ſheep having no ſhepherd. Then ſaith he unto his diſciples, The harveſt truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few. Pray ye the Lord of the harveſt, that he will ſend forth la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers into his harveſt. And he directly ſent forth the twelve into the harveſt. Mar. ix. 36—38.x. 1—7. And he ſent forth the ſeventy in the ſame manner. Luke x. 1—3. And he ſaid, Every ſcribe which is inſtructed unto the kingdom of heaven, is like unto a man that is an houſholder, which bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth out of his treaſure things new and old. Mat. xiii. 52. He is diligent, in the uſe of all lawful means, in ſtoring up knowledge of divine things, and of the ſtate of the church, as well as
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:024062_0015_0FC2FD91D7924188"/>the world of mankind; and out of this ſtore he bringeth forth food, to feed the people with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and underſtanding, which is the work of a paſtor according to God's own heart. Jer. iii. 15.</item>
                  <item>3. When ſpecial gifts are beſtowed upon any perſon, for the great work of the goſpel miniſtry, the authority of Chriſt requires him to be a faithful ſteward thereof, as he can anſwer it to God in the laſt day. Hence the apoſtle Paul, after he had given the law of Chriſt, concerning the ſupport of his miniſters, and given notice that he did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it of the church of Corinth, ſaid, <hi>Neceſſity</hi> is laid upon me; yea, wo is unto me, if I preach not the goſpel. 1 Cor. ix. 7—16. But many teachers in our day, inſiſt upon it, that all kind of <hi>neceſſity</hi> is inconſiſtent with moral agency. Though, at the ſame time, they lay a <hi>neceſſity</hi> upon all around them to yield to their <hi>wills,</hi> or to ſuffer from them. They are <hi>ſelfwilled,</hi> under the name of <hi>liberty.</hi> 2 Peter ii. 10, 19. But our Lord ſaid, All that the Father giveth me, ſhall come to me; and him that cometh to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out. For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own <hi>will,</hi> but the <hi>will</hi> of him that ſent me. John vi. 37, 38. And who will dare to plead for a moral agency, contrary to the declaration of Chriſt and his apoſtles! For they that are ſuch, ſerve not our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but their own belly; and by good words and fair ſpeeches deceive the hearts of the ſimple. To be <hi>ſelfwilled,</hi> is the cauſe of all the ſinful <hi>diviſions</hi> in the world. Rom. xvi. 17, 18. But God ſays, As every man hath received the gift, even ſo miniſter the ſame one to another, as good ſtewards of the manifold grace of God. If any man ſpeak, let him ſpeak as the oracles of God; if any man miniſter, let him do it as of the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:024062_0016_0FC2FD9DB136E080"/>ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jeſus Chriſt; to whom be praiſe and dominion forever and ever. Amen. 1 Peter iv. 10, 11.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The means and methods which God makes uſe of, in calling forth his miniſters, are exceeding va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; ſo that no exact ſteps can be deſcribed by us, for his calling forth his miniſters, any more than for his calling ſouls into the kingdom of his grace. But the teaching of the Spirit of God in his word, a view of the worth of ſouls and of the preſent ſtate of things among the people, with the command of Chriſt to preach his goſpel to them, is the eſſence of an internal call into that great work. The external call is by his church, who are inveſted with authority from Chriſt to carry all his laws into execution in his name. For, after warning believers of the danger, of being ſpoiled through <hi>philoſophy and vain deceit,</hi> by men who do not hold THE HEAD, he ſays, Let the <hi>word of Chriſt</hi> dwell in you richly in all wiſdom; teaching and admoniſhing one another in pſalms, and hymns, and ſpiritual ſongs, ſinging with grace in your hearts to the Lord. And whatſoever ye do in word or deed, do all <hi>in the name</hi> of the Lord Jeſus, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thanks to God and the Father by him. Col. ii. 8—10, 18—23. iii. 16, 17. In the laſt of theſe chapters he ſays, <hi>Covetouſneſs is idolatry.</hi> And in another place he ſays, No whoremonger, nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean perſon, nor <hi>covetous man who is an idolater,</hi> hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Chriſt, and of God. Eph. v. 5. And ſuch have ever had a great influence in all national churches, by whom all wars have been managed. But when the houſe of God, which is his church, ſhall be eſtabliſhed upon his revealed will, above all the powers of this
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:024062_0017_0FC2FD9F31168358"/>world, bloody wars will come to an end. And believers will ſay, <hi>All people will walk every one in the name of his god, and we will walk in the name of the Lord our God forever and ever.</hi> Micah iv. 1—5. <hi>The ſaints of the Moſt High ſhall take the kingdom, and poſſeſs the kingdom forever, even forever and ever.</hi> Dan. vii. 18. For, though the devil will deceive multitudes, after the reign of the ſaints for a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years, yet their complete deſtruction will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any interruption of the kingdom of the ſaints. Rev. xx. 7—9. All men deſire ſafety and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and no men would <hi>diſobey</hi> the revealed will of God, if they were not <hi>deceived.</hi> Titus iii. 3. Evil men and ſeducers ſhall wax worſe and worſe, <hi>deceiving,</hi> and being <hi>deceived.</hi> 2 Tim. iii. 13. No men would deceive others, if they were not firſt deceived themſelves. And Chriſt ſays, If it were poſſible, they ſhall <hi>deceive</hi> the very <hi>elect.</hi> Mat. xxiv. 24. And multitudes are now ſo much deceived, as to deny that God has an <hi>elect</hi> number among mankind, diſtinct from the reſt. But the apoſtle Peter writes to the ſaints, and calls them the <hi>Elect</hi> according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, <hi>through ſanctification of the Spirit unto obedience, and ſprinkling of the blood of Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> And to them he ſays, The <hi>elders</hi> which are among you I exhort, who am alſo an <hi>elder,</hi> and a witneſs of the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Chriſt, and alſo a partaker of the glory that ſhall be revealed; feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the overſight thereof, not by conſtraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; neither as being <hi>lords</hi> over God's heritage, but being <hi>enſamples</hi> of the flock. And when the chief Shepherd ſhall appear, ye ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a crown of glory that fadeth not away. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ye younger, ſubmit yourſelves unto the elder;
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:024062_0018_0FC2FDA0CE2AD4C0"/>yea, all of you be ſubject one to and be clothed with humility: for God reſiſteth the proud, and giveth grace unto the humble. 1 Peter i. 2. v. 1—5.</p>
            <p>Here is an exact deſcription of a church of Chriſt, and of the government thereof, diſtinct from all other communities in this world. They are elected by God, and ſanctified by his Spirit, and ſprinkled by the blood of Chriſt, our only High Prieſt. And all of theſe are an holy prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. But the chief officers in the church are called <hi>elders,</hi> in diſtinction from the reſt of <hi>God's heritage.</hi> They are alſo called <hi>overſeers</hi> or <hi>biſhops.</hi> Acts xx. 28. Titus i. 5, 7. And Peter, the firſt of the <hi>apoſtles,</hi> calls himſelf an <hi>elder.</hi> And it is the <hi>labouring elders,</hi> who are <hi>worthy of their reward.</hi> 1 Tim. v. 17, 18. <hi>And the Lord hath ordained, that they who preach the goſpel, ſhould live of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</hi> 1 Cor. ix. 14. And if an angel from heaven ſhould preach any other <hi>goſpel,</hi> than what the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles <hi>preached,</hi> and the churches then <hi>received,</hi> the command is, <hi>Let him be accurſed.</hi> Gal. i. 7—9. For the <hi>goſpel</hi> of Chriſt, ſaith unto Zion, <hi>Thy God reigneth.</hi> Iſaiah lii. 7. Rom. x. 15. His laws, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted by his church, where all muſt act as little children, is the eſſence of government therein. For <hi>lordſhip</hi> is of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and is excluded from the church of Chriſt. Mark x. 15, 42, 43. And it is now excluded from the United States of America, and from the government of France; and ſhall <hi>lordſhip</hi> be retained by religious miniſters? Shall every civil officer be ſet up, or depoſed by the people, and this liberty be denied to the church of Chriſt? How much hath infidelity been promoted by this tyranny? Yet many objections have been made againſt our doctrine, the chief of which I ſhall attempt to anſwer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:024062_0019_0FC2FDA4733705E0"/>
The <hi>firſt</hi> is, that we would ſet up common min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters of the word, as equal with the prophets and apoſtles. To which I anſwer, that the apoſtle Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in the paſſages now recited, puts himſelf upon a level with other elders, in the government of the church, ſaying, God reſiſteth the proud, and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth grace to the humble. And he begins his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond epiſtle by ſaying, Simon Peter, a ſervant and an apoſtle of Jeſus Chriſt, to them that have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained <hi>like precious faith with us, through the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> Grace and peace be multiplied unto you, through the knowledge of God, and of Jeſus our Lord; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godlineſs, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue; whereby are <hi>given unto us exceeding great and precious promiſes, that by theſe you might be partakers of the divine nature, having eſcaped the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption that is in the world through luſt.</hi> And giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all diligence, in the purſuit of virtue, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, temperance, patience, godlineſs, brotherly kindneſs, and charity, is the only way that he points out, for us to make our <hi>calling and election ſure.</hi> 2 Peter i. 1—10. Therefore all men who hold that they are <hi>elected,</hi> and ſhall be finally <hi>ſaved,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>diligence</hi> in the way of holineſs, are deceived. And enemies to ſalvation by ſovereign grace, have taken great advantage from ſuch men. But for any to claim the <hi>promiſes</hi> of God, without obeying his <hi>precepts,</hi> is <hi>tempting</hi> of him, and not <hi>truſting</hi> in him; which iniquity cauſed multitudes to lay their <hi>carcaſes in the wilderneſs.</hi> And Paul ſays, Let us labour therefore to enter into that reſt, left any man fall after the ſame example of unbelief. Deut. vi. 16, 17. Mat. iv. 7. Heb. iii. 5—11. iv. 11. By
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:024062_0020_0FC2FDA61433FF40"/>all which we may ſee, that the apoſtles put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon a level with every believer, about faith and obedience to God in his church. And one of them ſays, I wrote unto the church; but Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trephes, who loveth to have the pre-eminence among them, receiveth us not. Wherefore if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doth, prating againſt us with malicious words; and not content therewith, neither doth he himſelf receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and caſteth them out of the church. 3 John 9, 10. And the world hath been filled with ſuch arbitrary and malicious conduct, ever ſince the days of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine. All miniſters who claim a power above the church of Chriſt, in ſending forth his miniſters, exalt themſelves above the apoſtles, who claimed no <hi>dominion</hi> over the faith of the church. 2 Cor. i. 24.</p>
            <p>Yet a <hi>ſecond</hi> objection againſt the call now pleaded for, is taken from the words of Paul to Timothy, who ſaid, The things that thou haſt heard of me among many witneſſes, the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit thou to faithful men, who ſhall be able to teach others alſo. <hi>Commit thou,</hi> is held to be the work of miniſters in ordinations, and not of the church. But how little do theſe objectors regard other things in the ſame epiſtle? For therein the apoſtle ſays, Hold faſt <hi>the form</hi> of ſound words, which thou haſt heard of me, <hi>in faith and love which is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>—And the things that thou haſt heard of me among many witneſſes, the ſame commit thou to ſaithful men, who ſhall be able to teach others alſo.— This know alſo, that in the laſt days perilous times ſhall come; for men ſhall be <hi>lovers of their own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi>—having <hi>a form</hi> of godlineſs, but denying the power thereof: from ſuch turn away. 2 Tim. i. 13. ii. 2. iii. 1—5. <hi>The form</hi> of godlineſs is in
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:024062_0021_0FC2FDB1E49FB3B0"/>the holy ſcriptures; but <hi>a form,</hi> to cover <hi>ſelf-love,</hi> is condemned therein. It is alſo ſaid, The time will come when they will not endure ſound doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, but after their own luſts ſhall they heap to themſelves teachers, having itching ears. And they ſhall turn away their ears from the truth, and ſhall be turned unto fables. 2 Tim. iv. 3, 4. And what heaps of teachers of fables have there been ſince the apoſtolic age! and can there be a greater fable, than the conceit is of an external ſucceſſion of office power in officers from the apoſtles to our times! For if miniſters can initiate children into the church, before they can chooſe for themſelves, and no men but miniſters can give or take away that power, they are above all civil rulers upon earth, who are all ſet up or pulled down by the people. And is not this <hi>the great city, which reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth over the kings of the earth?</hi> Rev. xvii. 18.</p>
            <p>Yet, <hi>thirdly,</hi> many object againſt the internal call now pleaded for, as a thing which would deſtroy all order in the church. If every man who thinks he is called of God to preach the goſpel, is under obligation to do it, will not all manner of confuſion take place in the church, and no power on earth can controul them? Thus teachers have reaſoned againſt the call now pleaded for. But who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouled the power of Great-Britain, when they were ſpurred on by religious teachers, to contend with fire and ſword for power to take away our money unjuſtly? was it not the PEOPLE of America, aſſiſted by the eternal GOD, who maketh wars to ceaſe unto the end of the earth? Pſalm xlvi. 9. 10. He only calleth any ſoul out of darkneſs, into the marvellous light of his goſpel; and he ſays to his royal prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and holy nation, <hi>Submit yourſelves to every or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of man for the Lord's ſake.</hi> 1 Peter ii. 9, 13
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:024062_0022_0FC2FDB33879B3E0"/>If any men invade the rights of their neighbours, the magiſtrate beareth not the ſword in vain; for rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Rom. xiii. 1—10. While falſe teachers, bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he that putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war againſt him. Micah iii. 5. And if ſuch men are ſupported by the ſword of the magiſtrate, they are the greateſt obſtructers of all good order, both in church and ſtate. But when the church of Chriſt is governed by his laws, ſhe trieth falſe teachers, as well as falſe brethren, and is commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by her Lord for ſo doing. Rev. ii. 2, 3. It was the one particular church of Epheſus, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed this acceptable ſervice, and not all the ſeven churches of Aſia; and much leſs not a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of all their officers.</p>
            <p>Yet, <hi>fourthly,</hi> ſome inſiſt upon it, that if any think that they are called into the work of the goſpel miniſtry, by the ſame Spirit who called the prophets and apoſtles, they muſt work miracles to confirm their miſſion. But it is very evident, that working miracles, to confirm the truth of the word of God, was not ſo great an evidence of the call of a perſon into the kingdom of grace, or into the miniſtry, as the works of faith, hope, and charity. 1 Cor. xiii. 1—3, 13. And when a diſpute was raiſed in the church of Corinth, whether Paul was a true miniſter of Chriſt, or not, he ſaid, Ye are our epiſtle written in our hearts, known and read of all men; foraſmuch as ye are manifeſtly declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be the epiſtle of Chriſt, miniſtered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of ſtone, but in fleſhly tables of the heart. 2 Cor. iii. 1—3. Epiſtles of commendation, of members and miniſters, to thoſe
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:024062_0023_0FC2FDB44FE51F50"/>who knew them not before, is a practice eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by reaſon and revelation; but the converſion of ſouls, by the preaching of any man, is a greater commendation of the preacher, than external mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles upon the bodies of any men can be. For the turning fornicators unto a chaſte way of living; idolaters to the worſhip of the living God; thieves, the covetous, drunkards, revilers, and extortioners, into the ways of honeſty, liberality, temperance, and true benevolence, recommends the inſtruments of ſuch a glorious change, more than any letters written with ink and pen can do. Therefore Paul ſaid, <hi>The ſeal of mine apoſtleſhip are ye in the Lord.</hi> 1 Cor. vi. 8—11. ix. 2. How vain then is the above objection?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Many have objected againſt our doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, as that which would invalidate human learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the benefit of a liberal education; which they have called, <hi>A river, the ſtreams whereof ſhall make glad the city of God.</hi> But if we attend to the ſame ſacred writer, from whom they have taken theſe words, he will condemn their ſcheme. For he ſays, Bleſſed is the man that walketh not in the counſel of the ungodly, nor ſtandeth in the way of ſinners, nor ſitteth in the ſeat of the ſcornful; but his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in his law doth he meditate day and night. And he ſhall be like a tree planted by the <hi>rivers of water,</hi> that bringeth forth his fruit in his ſeaſon; his leaf alſo ſhall not wither, and whatſoever he doth ſhall proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Pſalm i. 1—3. xlvi. 4. Such men <hi>truſt in the Lord.</hi> But there is a <hi>curſe of blindneſs,</hi> upon all men who <hi>make fleſh their arm.</hi> Jer. xvii. 5—8. Therefore our Lord ſays, If any man thirſt, let him come unto me, and drink. He that believeth on me, as the ſcripture hath ſaid, out of his belly ſhall
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:024062_0024_0FC2FDB5E1FDA130"/>flow <hi>rivers of living water.</hi> John vii. 37, 38. O what blindneſs then have all teachers who put hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man learning in the place of DIVINE REVELATION! For none are truly <hi>learned,</hi> but they who are <hi>taught of God.</hi> John vi. 44, 45. Others are ever <hi>learning,</hi> and never able to come to the <hi>knowledge of the truth.</hi> 2 Tim. iii. 7. And ſuch men <hi>wreſt the ſcriptures</hi> unto their own deſtruction. 2 Peter iii. 16. So God ſaid of the church of Iſrael, Her princes within her are roaring <hi>lions;</hi> her judges are even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>wolves,</hi> they gnaw not the bones till the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. Her prophets are light and treacherous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; her prieſts have polluted the ſanctuary, they have <hi>done violence to the law.</hi> Zeph. iii. 3, 4. And national churches in latter ages, have done the like through the world. But an inſpired apoſtle ſays, What man knoweth the things of a man, ſave the ſpirit of man which is in him? even ſo the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God. Now we have received, not the ſpirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. Which things alſo we ſpeak, not in the words which man's wiſdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghoſt teacheth; comparing ſpiritual things with ſpiritual. 1 Cor. ii. 11—13. The <hi>words</hi> of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture were given by the Spirit of God, who gives us a moſt ſolemn warning againſt adding to, or taking therefrom. And I believe that the <hi>book of life,</hi> means the holy ſcriptures. Rev. xxii. 18, 19. For Moſes ſays, Set your hearts unto all the <hi>words</hi> which I teſtify among you this day; which ye ſhall command your children to obſerve, to do all the <hi>words</hi> of this law: for it is not a vain thing for you, becauſe it is <hi>your life.</hi> Deut. xxxii. 46, 47. And Chriſt ſays, <hi>The words that I ſpeak unto you,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:024062_0025_0FC2FDB74D4F0F08"/>they are Spirit, and they are life.</hi>—He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not <hi>my words,</hi> hath one that judgeth him: the <hi>word</hi> that I have ſpoken, the ſame ſhall judge him in the laſt day. John vi. 63. xii. 48. So Paul ſays, God ſhall judge the ſecrets of men by Jeſus Chriſt, according to <hi>my goſpel— Circumciſion is that of the heart, in the ſpirit, and not in the letter, whoſe praiſe is not of men, but of God.</hi> Rom. ii. 16, 29. Beware of <hi>dogs,</hi> beware of evil workers, beware of the <hi>conciſion. For we are the circumciſion, which worſhip God in the ſpirit, and rejoice in Chriſt Jeſus, and have no confidence in the fleſh.</hi> Phil. iii. 2, 3. And there is not a <hi>word</hi> in all the Bible, for bringing any one perſon into the church of Chriſt, without a <hi>perſonal</hi> confeſſion of faith in him. And this may help us in anſwering</p>
            <p>A <hi>ſixth</hi> objection againſt the neceſſity of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal call, by the Spirit of God, to preach his goſpel; which is, That many <hi>enthuſiaſts,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded perſons have held to ſuch an internal call; but none of the great reformers, nor of the fathers of this country, ever held to any ſuch thing. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, The example of ancient reformers, and of their good fathers, hath been the plea of all men when it would ſuit their deſigns; but when it did not pleaſe them, they were ready to exclaim againſt old traditions, and to follow their own inventions. Though, if the reformers in Germany, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of New-England, had not been moved by the Spirit of God, independent of all the powers of Europe, they could never have accompliſhed the great work of reformation in either country. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did the reformers in Germany, nor our fathers in this land, hold to an external ſucceſſion of miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial power from the church of Rome. But the church of England held theirs from thence; and
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:024062_0026_0FC2FDC3CEC3C130"/>they have now carried deceit and cruelty as far as any power upon earth, as America and the Eaſt-Indies have fully experienced. And the fathers of Plymouth colony, the firſt in New-England, held to an internal call to preach the goſpel, and reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed external force to ſupport religious miniſters, until the year 1658. And the next year two men were hanged at Boſton, whoſe <hi>blood</hi> hath cauſed loud exclamations againſt our country ever ſince. Though it is a moſt wicked thing for any to cenſure our whole country, for the evils which were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by a practice which our firſt fathers abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. A practice which came from Rome, through England to America. And it is impoſſible for any men to uſe force with others about the worſhip of God, without injuring all thoſe who diſſent from them. And though, while God was the only lawgiver for the church of Iſrael, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired that all adulterers, idolaters, and blaſphem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſhould die without mercy; yet he never al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them to uſe force in collecting proviſion for his houſe, or ſupport for his miniſters. Each man was to bring in the tithes and offerings that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, as he would deſire the bleſſing of God, and to eſcape his awful curſe. This is fully evident in the twenty-ſixth, and twenty-ſeventh chapters of Deuteronomy. And when they generally neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected his ordinances, after their return from cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, God ſaid, Ye are <hi>curſed</hi> with a <hi>curſe;</hi> for ye have <hi>robbed</hi> me, even this whole nation. Bring ye all the tithes into the ſtorehouſe, that there may be meat in mine houſe, and prove me now herewith, ſaith the Lord of hoſts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a <hi>bleſſing,</hi> that there ſhall not be room enough to receive it. Mal. iii. 7—10. At the ſame time he <hi>curſed the
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:024062_0027_0FC2FDC867D08140"/>bleſſings</hi> of the prieſts, for being <hi>partial in the law.</hi> Mal. ii. 1—9. And <hi>partiality and hypocriſy,</hi> are the unavoidable conſequence of ſupporting any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious teachers by force. Therefore it is ſaid, I the Lord love <hi>judgment,</hi> I hate <hi>robbery</hi> for a burnt offering. Iſaiah lxi. 1—8. Which words our Lord Chriſt applies to the goſpel day. Luke iv. 18—21. And men who are fond of judging others, while they do not obey the law of equity themſelves, he calls <hi>hypocrites, dogs, ſwine,</hi> and <hi>wolves.</hi> Mat. vii. 1—6, 12, 15. But the ruling party in every coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, have never been willing to think that they were ſuch. To know both <hi>good and evil,</hi> was the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and liberty which the ſerpent promiſed to our firſt mother; and all her children are deceived with ſuch flatteries to this day. Falſe ideas of <hi>good,</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry men away from the fountain of all <hi>good;</hi> but all who follow ſuch lying vanities, forſake their own mercies. For Chriſt is exalted to <hi>give repentance</hi> to Iſrael, and forgiveneſs of ſins. Acts v. 31. For by grace are ye ſaved, through <hi>faith;</hi> and that not of yourſelves; it is the <hi>gift of God.</hi> Eph. ii. 8. For the Lord God is a ſun and ſhield: the Lord will <hi>give grace and glory:</hi> no good thing will he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold from them that <hi>walk uprightly.</hi> Pſalm. lxxxiv. 11. He never promiſed his bleſſings to any, but in the way of truth and uprightneſs; and all who walk in that way, receive righteouſneſs and ſtrength from Chriſt, as a free <hi>gift of grace,</hi> and not for any good in them, or done by them. For God ſays, There is none that <hi>doth good, no not one.</hi> And he ſays this of <hi>all the world.</hi> Rom. iii. 12, 19. Yea, of <hi>the whole world.</hi> 1 John v. 19. Rev. xii. 9. And this may lead us to take notice of ſome capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal MARKS, whereby the miniſters of Chriſt may be known from all deceivers.</p>

1. True miniſters of Chriſt, <hi>preach the word of God in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity.</hi> Hence one of them ſaid, We are not as many, who <hi>corrupt the word of God;</hi> but as of <hi>ſincerity,</hi> as of God, in the fight of God ſpeak we in Chriſt.—We have renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the hidden things of <hi>diſhoneſty,</hi> not walking in <hi>craftineſs,</hi> nor handling the word of God <hi>deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> but by manifeſtation of the <hi>truth,</hi> commending ourſelves to every man's conſcience in the ſight of God.—I have eſpouſed you to one huſband, that I may preſent you as a <hi>chaſte virgin to Chriſt.</hi> But I fear leſt by any means, as the ſerpent beguiled Eve, through his <hi>ſubtilty,</hi> ſo your mind ſhould be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted from the <hi>ſimplicity</hi> that is in Chriſt. 2 Cor. i. 12. ii. 17. iv. 1, 2. xi. 2, 3. Another ſays, My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue, but in deed, and in <hi>truth.</hi> And hereby we know that we are of the <hi>truth,</hi> and ſhall aſſure our hearts before him. For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things. Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence towards God. And whatſoever we aſk, we receive of him, becauſe we keep his commandments, and do thoſe things that are pleaſing in his ſight. And this is his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, that we ſhould believe on the name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt, and love one another, as he gave us commandment. And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him; and hereby we know that he abideth in us, <hi>by the Spirit which he hath given us.</hi>—Ye are of God, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle children, and have overcome them; becauſe greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the <hi>world.</hi> They are of the <hi>world;</hi> therefore ſpeak they of the <hi>world,</hi> and the <hi>world</hi> heareth them. 1 John iii. 18—24. iv. 1—5. This is the exact
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:024062_0029_0FC2FDD0ACAB9F88"/>difference between the miniſters of Chriſt, and the miniſters of Antichriſt. But by <hi>confounding</hi> church and world together, which is <hi>Babylon,</hi> men have filled the world with hypocriſy and tyranny, under religious pretences. So an ancient prophet ſays, They break in pieces thy people, O Lord, and afflict thine heritage. They ſlay the widow and the ſtranger, and murder the fatherleſs. Yet they ſay, The Lord ſhall not ſee; neither ſhall the God of Jacob regard it.—Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowſhip with thee, which frameth miſchief by a law? Pſalm xciv. 5—7, 20. And from ſuch thrones, and ſuch laws, have come all the <hi>force</hi> that was ever uſed to ſupport religious teachers; and in Babylon will be found the <hi>blood</hi> of prophets, and of ſaints, and of all that were ſlain upon the earth. Rev. xviii. 24. But God hath promiſed to deſtroy the face of the covering caſt over all people, and the vail that is ſpread over all nations; and he ſays, In that day ſhall this ſong be ſung in the land of Judah, We have a ſtrong city; ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation will God appoint for walls and for bulwarks. Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in. Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whoſe mind is ſtayed on thee; becauſe he truſteth in thee. Truſt ye in the Lord forever; for in the Lord Jehovah is everlaſting ſtrength. For he bringeth down them that dwell on high, the lofty city he layeth it low; he layeth it low, even to the ground; he bringeth it even to the duſt. The foot ſhall tread it down, even the feet of the poor, and the ſteps of the needy. Iſaiah xxv. 6, 7. xxvi. 1—6.</p>
            <p>How exactly does this prophecy deſcribe the difference between the church of Chriſt, and all national churches in the world? For none have a
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:024062_0030_0FC2FDDE23945A48"/>right in the church of Chriſt, but <hi>righteous</hi> perſons, who <hi>keep the truth.</hi> They receive the perfect righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt as a <hi>free gift,</hi> and ſo are <hi>made righteous by the obedience of One;</hi> as we were all <hi>made ſinners by the diſobedience of one:</hi> only we were made ſinners <hi>by the law,</hi> but are made righteous <hi>by grace, abundance of grace.</hi> Rom. v. 12—19. For the <hi>wages</hi> of ſin is death; but the <hi>gift</hi> of God is eternal life, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. Rom. vi. 23. For the <hi>law</hi> was given by Moſes, but <hi>grace and truth</hi> came by Jeſus Chriſt. And he ſaid, To this end was I born, and for this cauſe came I into the world, that I ſhould bear witneſs unto the <hi>truth.</hi> Every one that is of the <hi>truth,</hi> heareth my voice. John i. 17. xviii. 37. And ſays God to his children, I have not written unto you becauſe ye know not the <hi>truth;</hi> but becauſe ye know it, and that <hi>no lie is of the truth.</hi> 1 John ii. 21. The devil is the father of <hi>lies,</hi> and he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced Eve into the opinion that the penalty of the law of God was not <hi>truth.</hi> But by ſuffering that penalty, Chriſt bear witneſs unto the <hi>truth,</hi> and bruiſed the head of the ſerpent. This he did, that God might be <hi>juſt,</hi> and the <hi>juſtifier</hi> of him which believeth in Jeſus. Where is boaſting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay; but by the law of faith. Rom. iii. 24—27. The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between <hi>debt,</hi> and a <hi>gift,</hi> is as plain as any idea in the world. <hi>Juſtice</hi> requires the payment of <hi>debts;</hi> but <hi>gifts</hi> are beſtowed on whom the giver pleaſeth. And ſalvation is appointed for walls and for bulwarks around the righteous nation, who keep the truth. And God ſays, With the heart man believeth unto <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> and with the mouth confeſſion is made unto <hi>ſalvation.</hi> Rom. x. 10. This is the only way into his church,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:024062_0031_0FC2FDE07523C280"/>which God hath appointed. But many put <hi>moral ſincerity,</hi> in the room of <hi>godly ſincerity,</hi> in building churches; and hereby cruel <hi>perſecutors</hi> are intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. For our Lord ſays, The time cometh, that whoſoever killeth you, will think he doth God ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. John xvi. 2. And Paul ſays, I verily thought with myſelf, that I ought to do many things contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the name of Jeſus of Nazareth. Acts xxvi. 9. But I obtained mercy, becauſe I did it <hi>ignorantly,</hi> in unbelief. 1 Tim. i. 13. All men who ſin <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly,</hi> or <hi>wilfully</hi> againſt the <hi>Spirit of grace,</hi> never had any <hi>atonement</hi> proclaimed for them. 2 Peter ii. 10. Heb. x. 26—29. Numb. xv. 30. Therefore the apoſtle John ſays, If any man ſee a brother ſin a ſin which is not unto death, he ſhall aſk, and he ſhall give him life for them that ſin not unto death. There is a ſin unto death; I do not ſay, that ye ſhall pray for it. All unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is ſin; and there is a ſin not unto death. We know that whoſoever is born of God ſinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himſelf, and that wicked one toucheth him not. 1 John v. 16—18. How dangerous then is it, for any to receive any into the church without evidence of their being born of God? For they who have only <hi>a form of godlineſs,</hi> while they <hi>reſiſt the truth,</hi> are <hi>reprobate</hi> concerning the faith. 2 Tim. iii. 5—8. If Jeſus Chriſt is not in them, they are <hi>reprobates.</hi> 2 Cor. xiii. 2—6. They profeſs that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and diſobedient, and unto every good work <hi>reprobate.</hi> Titus i. 16. The word ſignifies <hi>adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate</hi> or <hi>counterfeit.</hi> Jer. vi. 30. Yet many now inſiſt upon it, that we cannot believe that God <hi>elected</hi> a certain number of men, to holineſs and eternal happineſs, without <hi>reprobating</hi> all the reſt.
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:024062_0032_0FC2FDE7CE49DA28"/>But who ever thought that a government could not make <hi>good money,</hi> without making <hi>counterfeit</hi> alſo! or who will ſay, that <hi>grace,</hi> ſhown by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, is inconſiſtent with <hi>vengeance</hi> on rebels! Such men deny the only Lord God, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who <hi>deſtroys</hi> impenitent unbelievers. They defile the fleſh, deſpiſe dominion, and ſpeak evil of dignities. Jude 4—8.</p>
            <p n="2">2. True miniſters are <hi>examples to the flock.</hi> Nothing is more pernicious to the ſouls of men, than the ſight of evils in teachers which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn in the people. Therefore the firſt of the apoſtles ſays to all believers, So is the will of God, that with welldoing ye may put to ſilence the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of fooliſh men: as free, and not uſing your liberty for a cloak of maliciouſneſs, but as the ſervants of God.—For hereunto were ye call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; becauſe Chriſt alſo ſuffered for us, leaving us an <hi>example,</hi> that ye ſhould follow his ſteps: who did no ſin, neither was <hi>guile</hi> found in his mouth: who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he ſuffered, he threatened not; but committed himſelf to him that judgeth righteouſly: who his own ſelf bare our ſins in his own body on the tree, <hi>that we, being dead to ſin, ſhould live unto righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs:</hi> by whoſe ſtripes ye were healed. For ye were as ſheep going aſtray, but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Biſhop of your ſouls.—The elders which are among you I exhort, who am alſo an elder—feed the flock of God which is among you—being <hi>enſamples</hi> to the flock. 1 Peter ii. 15—25. v. 1—3. Another ſays, Shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will ſhew thee my faith by my works. James ii. 18. A third ſays, Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk ſo, as ye have us for an <hi>enſample.</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:024062_0033_0FC2FDE8ADBD1370"/>(For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are enemies of the croſs of Chriſt; whoſe end is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, whoſe God is their belly, and whoſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is in their ſhame, who mind earthly things). For our converſation is in heaven, from whence alſo we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; who ſhall change our vile body, that it may be faſhioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to ſubdue all things unto himſelf. Phil. iii. 17—21. Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that ye withdraw yourſelves from every brother that walketh <hi>diſorderly,</hi> and not after the tradition which he received of us. For yourſelves know how ye ought to <hi>follow us;</hi> for we behaved not ourſelves <hi>diſorderly</hi> among you, neither did we <hi>eat any man's bread for nought.</hi> 2 Theſſ. iii. 6—9.

And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himſelf by Jeſus Chriſt, and hath given to us the miniſtry of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation. 2 Cor. v. 17, 18.

But God ſays, Wo unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkneſs for light, and light for darkneſs; that put bitter for ſweet, and ſweet for bitter. Iſaiah v. 20.

3. Our Lord is ever <hi>with his faithful miniſters.</hi> Lo, I am with you alway, is his promiſe to all his faithful ſervants, even unto the end of the world. And he only can direct and ſupport them, in the midſt of outward and inward enemies, and make them faithful unto death.

Be not thou therefore aſhamed of the teſtimony of our Lord, nor of me his priſoner; but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the goſpel, according to the <hi>power</hi> of God; who hath ſaved us, and call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpoſe and grace which was given us in Chriſt Jeſus, before the world began; but is now made manifeſt by the appearing of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who hath aboliſhed death, and hath brought life and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality to light through the goſpel. 2 Tim. i. 7—10.

And ever ſince ſhe hearkened to him, he hath held her children in bondage through <hi>fear of death;</hi> from which the <hi>death of Chriſt</hi> is our on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way of deliverance. Heb. ii. 13—18. And God laid this plan of ſalvation in his Son, before the world began; and no teachers are to be followed, but they who hold that Jeſus Chriſt is <hi>the ſame</hi> yeſterday, and to-day, and forever. Heb. xiii. 7, 8. He is <hi>unchangeable</hi> in the <hi>deſigns</hi> of his grace, and in his <hi>power</hi> to carry the ſame into execution. And Paul ſaid, I will come to you, if the Lord will, and will know, not the ſpeech of them which are puffed up, but the <hi>power;</hi> for the kingdom of God is not in word, but in <hi>power.</hi> I Cor. iv. 19, 20. And we are required to turn away from all who deny the <hi>power of godlineſs.</hi> 2 Tim. iii. 5. And how
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:024062_0035_0FC2FDEBDF5627E0"/>full is the world of ſuch! Even of men who deny the <hi>power</hi> of God in changing the heart, and in carrying his children, in the way of holineſs unto eternal happineſs. The number of the beaſt is the number of <hi>a man;</hi> and his number is ſix hundred ſixty and ſix. Rev. xiii. 18. God gave Iſrael <hi>reſt,</hi> in the ſeventh day, the ſeventh month, and ſeventh year. And Jeſus ſays, Come unto me, all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you <hi>reſt.</hi> Mat. xi. 28. And our apoſtle ſays, We which have believed do enter into <hi>reſt.</hi> Heb. iv. 28. But God ſays, The wicked are like the troubled ſea, when it cannot <hi>reſt,</hi> whoſe waters caſt up mire and dirt. Iſaiah lvii. 20. Raging waves of the ſea, foaming out their own ſhame. Jude 13. They have <hi>no reſt</hi> day nor night, who worſhip the beaſt and his image, and whoſoever receiveth the mark of his name. Rev. xiv. 11. The inventions of men about the worſhip of God give <hi>no reſt,</hi> in hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, in tens, or in units. And this is as true in all who neglect his worſhip, and purſue the world for ſafety and happineſs, as in any falſe worſhip. Therefore our apoſtle ſays, Let your converſation be without <hi>covetouſneſs,</hi> and be <hi>content</hi> with ſuch things as ye have; for he hath ſaid, I will never leave thee, nor forſake thee. So that we may bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man ſhall do unto me. Heb. xiii. 5, 6. And if he is with every true believer, he ſurely is with every faithful miniſter. And the more faithful any ſoul is, the more they will know of this truth.</p>
            <p>Yet two objections have been raiſed againſt this mark. One is, that the ſervants of God, in all ages, have often lamented their caſe, as unſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in their work, through the hardneſs and blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their hearers. Anſwer, This is the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:024062_0036_0FC2FDF7A8492028"/>conſequence of faithfulneſs in the cauſe of God, until his church ſhall be wholly governed by his laws, independent of the world. For the light of revelation enlarges the capacities of men, beyond any other means in the world; and where men in power have not had the truth of God rooted in their hearts, they have joined with falſe teachers, in blinding the minds of the people againſt it, in order to graſp all the honors and profits of the whole community to themſelves. So in Iſrael God ſaid, The prophets propheſy falſely, and the prieſts bear rule by their means, and my people love to have it ſo: and what will ye do in the end thereof. Jer. v. 31. Wo unto you lawyers; for ye have taken away the key of knowledge; ye entered not in yourſelves, and them that were entering, ye hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. Luke xi. 52. And no ſuch men are ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able judges, about the miniſters of Chriſt, but are perſecuters of them. And <hi>careleſſneſs, hardneſs,</hi> and <hi>piercing cruelty,</hi> like the highway, ſtoney, or thorny ground, is the character that our Lord gives of moſt hearers of his word; while <hi>underſtanding, honeſty,</hi> and <hi>patience,</hi> in bringing forth good fruit, is the character of all who receive the ſeed into good ground. Mat. xiii. 14—23. Luke viii. 11—15. And a faithful miniſter ſaid, We are unto God a ſweet ſavour of Chriſt; in them that are ſaved, and in them that periſh. To the one we are the ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of death unto death; and to the other the ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of life unto life: and who is ſufficient for theſe things? 2 Cor. ii. 15, 16. A queſtion which none can clearly anſwer, without faith in Chriſt, who ſays, <hi>My grace is ſufficient for thee.</hi> 2 Cor. xii. 9. God ſuffered the magicians of Egypt to deceive Pharaoh, ſo that he hardened his heart, againſt the command of God by Moſes, to let Iſrael go and
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:024062_0037_0FC2FDFB680404C0"/>ſerve him. And he ſays of falſe teachers under the goſpel, As Jannes and Jambres <hi>withſtood</hi> Moſes, ſo do theſe alſo <hi>reſiſt the truth;</hi> men of corrupt minds, <hi>reprobate</hi> concerning the faith. But they ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed no further; for their folly ſhall be manifeſt unto all men, as theirs alſo was. 2 Tim. iii. 8, 9. And is not this word now fulfilled? For the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the prudent is to <hi>underſtand</hi> his way; but the <hi>folly of fools is deceit.</hi> Prov. xiv. 8. And how is <hi>deceit</hi> now expoſed in Europe and America! <hi>Fear</hi> moved the Egyptians to ſend Iſrael away with rich treaſures, in the very night that God told Abraham of four hundred and thirty years before. Exod. xii. 29—41. Pſalm cv. 37, 38. And if <hi>fear</hi> can do ſuch great things, what will it do when united with the <hi>love of Chriſt</hi> in the heart? For this union forms the <hi>new creature.</hi> 2 Cor. v. 11—17. Therefore all men who profeſs the Chriſtian religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without loving Chriſt above all creatures, are <hi>deceived.</hi> The other objection againſt the doctrine of knowing the miniſters of Chriſt by his preſence and bleſſing with them, is the great and boaſted ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of many deceivers. But how little do ſuch ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors regard the words of our Lord? for he ſays, <hi>Ye ſhall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thiſtles?</hi> Mat. vii. 15—23. A good man, out of the good treaſure of his heart, bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man, out of the evil treaſure of his heart, bringeth forth that which is evil; for of the abundance of the heart, his mouth ſpeaketh. Luke vi. 45. When a baptized perſon offered money for power to convey the Holy Ghoſt to others, by the laying on of his hands, Peter ſaid, <hi>Thou haſt neither part nor lot in this matter; for thy heart is not right in the ſight of God.</hi> Acts. viii. 21. His words diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:024062_0038_0FC2FDFCED8A7A50"/>that he was a <hi>hypocrite,</hi> and no ſuch have any right in the church of Chriſt. But moſt teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers now in the world, deſpiſe the idea of enquiring after an inward change of heart, in order for the admiſſion of any into the church, or into the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtry. External baptiſms, and laying on of hands, without faith in Chriſt, who hath opened a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to waſh our ſouls from ſin, and bears away all our guilt, hath filled the church with <hi>briars</hi> and <hi>thorns.</hi> Heb. vi. 1—8. For the ſons of Belial ſent their ſervants to the people, ſaying, Thou ſhalt give it me now; and if not, <hi>I will take it by force.</hi> 1 Sam. ii. 12, 16. And the ſons of Belial ſhall be all of them as <hi>thorns</hi> thruſt away, becauſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be taken with hands. 2 Sam. xxiii. 6. And what concord hath Chriſt with Belial?—Come out from among them, and be ye <hi>ſeparate,</hi> ſaith the Lord. 2 Cor. vi. 15—17. <hi>Unbelievers</hi> ſaid, <hi>We be not able.</hi> But <hi>believers,</hi> leaving ſelf out of the queſtion, ſaid, <hi>Their defence is departed from them, and the Lord is with us: fear them not.</hi> Num. xiii. 30—33. xiv. 6—9. And in reference to them, God calls us to <hi>hold faſt the confidence, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing of the hope firm unto the end;</hi> and not to <hi>harden our hearts,</hi> as thoſe unbelievers did. Heb. iii. 5—11. For they who worſhip the beaſt, tread the <hi>holy city</hi> under foot, and ſay, Who is like unto the beaſt? who is <hi>able</hi> to make war with him? Rev. xi. 2. xiii. 4. Men who judge for reward, teach for hire, and divine for money, act upon neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atives, and ſay, Is not the Lord among us? none evil can come upon us. Micah iii. 11. But God ſays, Who hath <hi>required</hi> this at your hand to tread my courts?—Your hands are full of <hi>blood.</hi> Iſaiah i. 12, 15. And how much <hi>blood</hi> hath lately been ſhed in our land?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="unknown:024062_0039_0FC2FE06049B7568"/>
The church of Chriſt is a <hi>holy city,</hi> which is the <hi>light of the world.</hi> Mat. v. 14—16. But ſhe hath been clothed with ſackcloth or <hi>mourning,</hi> ever ſince the beaſt aroſe out of the bottomleſs pit. She is <hi>one city,</hi> as all the ſaints make but <hi>one church.</hi> But while on earth they are many <hi>cities,</hi> or <hi>churches.</hi> A city is a corporation, inveſted with power to govern all within its limits, and to expel all from it, who refuſe to ſubmit to their government. And ſuch is the power which Chriſt gives to every one of his churches, as we have before proved. And he ſays, The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, becauſe the Lord hath <hi>anointed</hi> me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath ſent me to bind up the broken hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the priſon to them that are bound: to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God, to comfort all that <hi>mourn.</hi>—And they ſhall build the old waſtes, they ſhall raiſe up the former deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, they ſhall repair the <hi>waſte cities, the deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of many generations.</hi> The men who ſhall do this great work are the <hi>poor in ſpirit,</hi> the <hi>mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> the <hi>meek,</hi> they who <hi>hunger and thirſt after righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> are <hi>merciful, pure in heart, peace-makers,</hi> and <hi>perſecuted for righteouſneſs ſake.</hi> Mat. v. 3—14. Theſe are the only <hi>judges</hi> in the church of Chriſt, which will be <hi>light indeed.</hi> For <hi>judgment</hi> will then take place, and <hi>robbery</hi> be excluded from the church of Chriſt, in the ſupport of his miniſters. This is the goſpel which he <hi>proclaimed</hi> to ſinful men, with <hi>vengeance</hi> upon all who rejected his <hi>proclamation.</hi> Iſaiah lxi. 1—8. Luke iv. 18—21. <hi>Offer</hi> of the goſpel, inſtead of the word <hi>proclaim</hi> or <hi>preach,</hi> hath deceived multitudes with a conceit, that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained privileges which they might now receive,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:024062_0040_0FC2FE0A86F46540"/>or not, as they may any thing which men <hi>offer</hi> to them. Whereas the goſpel is a proclamation of grace, which coſt Chriſt his precious <hi>blood;</hi> and he ſays, <hi>Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of ſalvation.</hi> 2 Cor. v. 21. vi. 1, 2. Therefore we ought to give the more earneſt heed to the things which we have heard, leſt at any time we ſhould let them ſlip. For if the word ſpoken by angels was ſtedfaſt, and every tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and diſobedience received a juſt recompenſe of reward, how ſhall we eſcape if we <hi>neglect ſo great ſalvation,</hi> which at the firſt began to be ſpoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him; God alſo bearing them witneſs, both with ſigns and wonders and divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, according to his own will? Heb. ii. 1—4. The paſſover was to be kept without <hi>leaven;</hi> and God ſaid, The man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and <hi>forbeareth</hi> to keep the paſſover, even that ſame ſoul ſhall be cut off from his people, becauſe he brought not the offering of the Lord in his <hi>appointed ſeaſon:</hi> that ſoul ſhall bear his ſin. Exod. xii. 15. Num. ix. 13. <hi>Hypocriſy, malice and wickedneſs,</hi> is the <hi>leaven</hi> which God commands us to <hi>purge out,</hi> as we would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to enjoy his preſence, and to eſcape his <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> even ſickneſs and death. Luke xii. 1. 1 Cor. v. 7, 8. xi. 30—32. For the time is come that judgment muſt begin at the houſe of God: and if it firſt begin at us, what ſhall the end be of them that obey not the goſpel of God? and if the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſcarcely be ſaved, where ſhall the ungodly and the ſinner appear? 1 Peter iv. 17, 18.</p>
            <p>Theſe are queſtions which ought to alarm every ſoul. For all the troubles of the righteous, which they meet with in this world, are becauſe of their
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:024062_0041_0FC2FE142B064458"/>own ſins, or the iniquity of others; and if they are ſaved with ſo much difficulty, where will thoſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear who indulge known ſin, and neglect known duty, to avoid preſent trouble? They might as ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally yield to enemies to eſcape danger, or drink poiſon to preſerve health. For <hi>deceit</hi> is the <hi>poiſon of aſps.</hi> Rom. iii. 13. And faith in the blood of Chriſt, is the only remedy againſt all ſuch poiſon. His blood will purge the conſcience from dead works, to ſerve the living God. If we ſay that we have no ſin we <hi>deceive</hi> ourſelves, and the <hi>truth</hi> is not in us. If we confeſs our ſins, he is <hi>faithful</hi> and <hi>juſt</hi> to forgive our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſs. 1 John i. 8, 9. And how far is each one from <hi>honeſty,</hi> who will not confeſs his ſins to God? And how great is the privilege for it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the goſpel? Under the law, none might be prieſts but the lawful ſeed of Aaron; but under the goſpel, every penitent believer is made a king and a prieſt unto God. Rev. i. 5, 6. And it is a moſt pernicious deluſion, for any man to think he can be a prieſt unto God, without faith in the blood of Chriſt, and a life of devotedneſs to his ſervice. But all who are thus devoted to him, are both kings and prieſts; and the government of the church of Chriſt belongs to them, <hi>independent</hi> of all the world beſides. Therefore no man can be ſafely received as a religious teacher, who is not a member of ſome particular church, who can cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and exclude him, if he breaks any of the laws of Chriſt. For Chriſt plainly commended the church of Epheſus for ſo doing; and Paul appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the church of Corinth, againſt <hi>deceitful teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</hi> 2 Cor. xi. 13. xiii. 1—3. And who will dare to claim a power above Chriſt and his apoſtles! For if the church had not been aſleep, iniquity
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:024062_0042_0FC2FE181D644AC0"/>could not have prevailed as it hath done. But our apoſtle ſays, It is high time to <hi>awake out of ſleep;</hi> for now is our ſalvation nearer than when we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved. The night is far ſpent, the day is at hand: let us therefore caſt off the works of darkneſs, and let us put on the armour of light. Let us walk <hi>honeſtly</hi> as in the day; not in rioting and drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs, not in chambering and wantonneſs, not in ſtrife and envying. But put ye on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and make not proviſion for the fleſh, to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil the luſts thereof. Rom. xiii. 11—14. If he were truly obeyed, glory would ſoon dwell in our land.</p>
