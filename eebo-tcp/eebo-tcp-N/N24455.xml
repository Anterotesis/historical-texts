            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Towards this end, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted that my account with you might be prepared, in order to be adjuſted, and that I might be enabled by the poſſeſſion of the notes or ſome competent authorization, and an authenticated copy of the contract of ſale, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſum which was coming to me out of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds

have ſeparated yourſelves from us with a view to entangle or make us in any reſpect, liable for the ſale to Meſſrs. Gomez, Lopez and Rivera, we truſt you will find a diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment; ſuch an idea is too ridiculous to admit of a moment's ſerious conſideration. In juſtice to thoſe gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen who have become the purchaſers of the goods, we think proper to obſerve, that they are men of property and fair characters, and that we are diſpoſed to treat them with a degree of delicacy throughout this unfortunate tranſaction, which will evidently end in a conſiderable loſs, and prove a groſs deception by their not having a competent knowledge in the article of cotton, it would therefore be with reluctance that we ſhould undertake any thing that might operate to their prejudice or injury. Still we are not unwilling to devote ourſelves to your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, nor do we ſee any reaſon for all the difficulties and anxieties your imagination is apparently troubled with, without ſuſtaining any real cauſe of alarm.</p>

                     <p>I received yeſterday your letter of the 6th inſt. with the accounts mentioned in it, which to my ſurpriſe takes no direct notice of my letter to you of the ſame date. I paſs by the ſingular inſinuation which it contains, and confine myſelf to the real buſineſs in queſtion between us. I obſerve with regret, that (though you have dropped one of the items which originally compoſed your claim, the premiums of inſurance) you perſiſt in the idea of retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing excluſively in your command and diſpoſition, the whole of my property on the ground of a lien upon it, ariſing from your agency, which according to your own ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment amounts to little more than one fifth of its value, and adhere to your objection, to give me an authorization to receive any part of it. It was ever my intention, and as I conceived imported in my original propoſitions, to provide for your payment and ſecurity to the extent of your juſt claims, as the condition of the authorization, I demand of you to receive what was rightfully coming to me. This was equally the intention of the co-operation propoſed by my letter of the ſixth, and I continue diſpoſed to enter into that co-operation upon this principle. It is true there are ſeveral items in your account, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> which we differ in opinion; yet I am ready to make ſuitable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations and arrangements towards a right adjuſtment of them, but I cannot conceive that this ought to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, or ought now to impede precautions and meaſures tending to ſecure a due application of the proceeds of the cargo, and to put me in poſſeſſion of the funds to which I am indubitably entitled, and according to the election which was reſerved for my benefit in the terms of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract. On this ground of putting me in a ſituation to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs without delay, that to which I am indiſputably enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, and of leaving your juſt and legal claims upon the property, and otherwiſe, unimpaired, I am ſtill willing
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:032369_0033_0FF1FAAD622499C0"/>
to co-operate. But as I conceive there were pretenſions and omiſſions in the firſt inſtance, which render you reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponſible for conſequences, as it may now be too late to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the deficiency, as every moment's delay increaſes the riſks, I ſtill make the offer of co-operation, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of holding you in the ſame ſtate of reſponſibility in which you were prior to that offer. At the ſame time it will be explicitly underſtood, that in acceding to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operation on this condition, you do not incur any new or additional reſponſibility. With this explanation, I urge an immediate and poſitive anſwer whether you will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in an arrangement on this baſe. Moments are preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. That which might be uſeful now, may quickly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come uſeleſs by procraſtination. The nature of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operation will be an after conſideration. The terms to be ſettled between us, according to our mutual opinions, and the advice we may mutually take.</p>

                     <p>YOUR favor of yeſterday is received. It is not our wiſh to throw any embarraſſments in your way, but the magnitude of our claims, and our engagements in your behalf, render it proper that we proceed with caution. To ſtop the ſhip until the inſurance was completed, was not in our power. Meſſrs. Gomez, Lopez and Rivera ſtipulated to make inſurance, but this might be done, as well after, as before the veſſel ſailed; and if neglected al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, it would amount to a breach of contract only, for which the veſſel could not be detained. With reſpect to the premium for inſurance paid by us, although we omitted it in our laſt account, we do not aſſent to the force of your objection to the payment of it. The inſurance being effected for your benefit and ſecurity, it is more reaſonable that you ſhould run the hazard of
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:032369_0034_0FF1FAB14733C000"/>
recovering back the premium than we, who act only as agents. To remove however every impediment to a ſettlement, and manifeſt a ſpirit of accommodation, this charge has been for the preſent dropped. We cannot forbear remarking, that notwithſtanding your ſolicitude to obtain the authorization in queſtion, you conſtantly uphold a claim upon us for certain conſequences, without pointing out in what manner we may have rendered our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves reſponſible. Although we are not conſcious of any act which can give you this claim, and are therefore eaſy on this head, yet you cannot but perceive the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety of our admitting, that we have incurred this reſponſibility, which we ſhould do, were we to come to a ſettlement upon the terms propoſed by you. As to our lien on the notes, and other documents relating to this tranſaction, we never had any doubt of our right to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them, and alſo to refuſe you any authority to act, until the whole of our demand was ſatisfied, and we ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactorily ſecured againſt contingent claims. Indeed as the contract is in our name, and we are bound under a penalty of 20,000 dollars to endorſe on the notes, which are alſo in our favor, the payments as they are made, we might inſiſt (were we diſpoſed as you inſinuate to create difficulties) upon all the monies paſſing through our hands, or thoſe of an agent choſen by us, and for that purpoſe keep poſſeſſion of every paper until the tranſaction was finally cloſed. But we are ſincerely anxious to put an end to a controverſy, which did not originate with us; for this purpoſe we beg leave to refer you to our letter of the 6th inſtant, in which we were ſo explicit as to the terms upon which we were willing to give you the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority you deſire, and to co-operate with you, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing remains to be added. To give you, however, a further proof of our wiſh for a ſpeedy and amicable ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement, we are willing, if theſe terms are not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to you, to ſubmit the whole matter to arbitration.</p>

               <p>From this expoſition, it appears, that all the claims of Meſſrs.

Gomez, Lopez and Rivera, ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling me to receive the whole or any part of their obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in France, I decide on making the following pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals to Meſſrs. Gouverneur and Kemble, which will convince them of my diſpoſition to come to an arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. To give me an authenticated copy of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of ſale, and authorization to receive out of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds of the cargo, after the freight will have been paid, and immediately after that payment only, one hundred thouſand dollars, in part of the obligations of Meſſrs.

               <p n="2">2d. To keep at their diſpoſal the balance of the above mentioned obligations, amounting to dollars 22415 37 for their bond to the cuſtoms, ſaving to myſelf the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of this balance when the landing certificates are ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, and after the final ſettlement of our account.</p>
               <p n="3">3d. To drop for the preſent all altercations, reſpecting the reſponſibility which I have a right to exerciſe againſt Meſſrs. Gouverneur and Kemble, if the delay of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary diſpoſitions in France ſhould be productive of ſome injury to me in the recovery of the obligations of the purchaſers of my goods.</p>
               <p>I preſume that Meſſrs.

But inſtead of this, you merely refer me to your former propoſitions, of which I know not any except a reference to arbitration—I am obliged therefore to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude ſtill more firmly than heretofore, that it is your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination at all events to retain my whole property in your diſpoſition, till the final winding up of the ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Meſſrs.

We have offered, and again repeat the propoſal, that we will deliver into your hands, all the papers and notes which regard this tranſaction without delay, upon your giving us ſatisfactory ſecurity in this country; to pay us in a reaſonable time our commiſſion, and ſuch ſums as we may have diſburſed, or made ourſelves reſponſible for, on your account, and alſo ſufficiently ſecure us againſt the payment of ſuch ſums as we may eventually be called upon by reaſon of our interference in this buſineſs. When it is conſidered that we have a right to inſiſt upon immediate payment of the balance of our account, as the condition of our delivering up theſe papers, you cannot deem this propoſition unreaſonable. We are certainly not obliged to receive payment in France, eſpecially at a time when ſo many difficulties attend getting money from that country, and were we to accede to the terms held out by your favour of this date, we ſhould be obliged to wait the event of an application for the money to Meſs. Gomez, Lopez and Rivera in France, before we could have recourſe to you. Much more has already been ſaid upon this ſubject than was neceſſary; to conclude, we conceive ourſelves entitled to keep all the ſecurities we have at preſent, and were we diſpoſed to be litigious, we might, even now, apply to you in a judicial way for payment of our demand. This being our ſituation, we have no heſitation in rejecting your offers of this day as inadmiſſible. If you are ſo ſolicitous of having authenticated copies of the contract, and an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rization
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:032369_0041_0FF1FACA5A4E3508"/>
to receive the money, we are willing to give them upon the terms herein before mentioned, or upon any other which three indifferent Gentlemen ſhall point out. We hope this propoſal will not only be deemed fair, but that it will remove the chagrin occaſioned by ours of the twelfth inſtart.</p>

By your not meeting me duly when I demanded of you my account, to the end that it might be adjuſted and ſettled to your entire ſatisfaction and full diſcharge, by your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to permit any intervention of mine in the affair, by your declaring that you took all upon yourſelves, and engaging or encouraging the buyers to depart with the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go immediately, you have placed me under the impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of putting into execution any of the diſpoſitions I had meditated, and now that I am deprived of my property as the mean of engaging the aid and interpoſitions of friends, a demand is made upon me which for its indefiniteneſs alone is altogether exceptionable.

Fearing he ſhould have miſunderſtood you, I now requeſt to know of you gentlemen, if Mr. Gomez has ſent you the neceſſary certificate, and if it has been

               <p>We have received a letter from you this day, dated on the firſt of the month, wherein you make an enquiry reſpecting a certificate Mr. Barretto preſented to us to cancel our bond for ſome ſugars exported in the White Fox. We wanted Mr. Barretto to leave us the certificate to ſee if it could be made to anſwer that purpoſe as it was irregular, but he objected to it before he had ſeen Mr. Cherriot. Since then we have heard nothing further about it—if it is in your poſſeſſion, it would be well for you to ſend it to us, and we will ſee what may be further needful. We have received from the cuſtom houſe, the debenture of duties on your goods which we ſhall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for—but we muſt be indemnified for our bonds, or the needful papers muſt be returned to us to procure them cancelled. Directions were given Mr. Gomez for that purpoſe reſpecting the goods under his care, but the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar in queſtion he never had any thing to do with. That unfortunate adventure of Mr. Gomez, as we were well aware of, is like to turn to a ruinous account. After waiting ſome time at Havre, he has been obliged to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> further riſks, and expences by proceeding to Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh for a market. Under all theſe diſagreeable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, attending ſo reſpectable a property, we cannot help regretting that you have withdrawn yourſelf from us, and the ſteps you have been purſuing, which muſt ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately operate to your prejudice while it appears to us ſo needful you ſhould have aſſociated with us, to have concerted all neceſſary means for its preſervation and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity which we have at all times held ourſelves open to

I wiſh it could be admitted at the cuſtom houſe, to cancel your bond.

Not being myſelf well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the forms preſcribed, and not knowing the inſtructions you may have given Mr. Gomez, I cannot judge in what point it is deficient, but I think there is yet time enough to have it corrected; and I return it with this letter, ſo that you make of it what uſe you think fit. The ſame letter covered alſo copy of a letter from Mr. Gomez to your houſe, dated at Hamburgh the 12th of Auguſt; with another copy of a letter which the ſame gentleman wrote the ſame day to his houſe of Gomez, Lopez and Rivera. I am ſorry to ſee that affair turn out ſo unfavourably, and the loſs which thoſe gentlemen are likely to ſuffer from it. It is one of thoſe accidents to which every ſpeculation of that kind is expoſed; and I am yet in hopes that the reſult will not be ſo unfavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as Mr. Gomez ſeems to apprehend, by the ſtart of the price of cotton in the London market, and a little patience. However the buſineſs may turn out, I ſhould hope that you have taken every precaution to inſure to yourſelves the whole amount of the obligations of Meſſrs. Gomez, Lopez and Rivera, and ſhould be ſorry if you were to ſuffer on account of the iſſue of that operation.

               <p>We wiſhed for your ſake to purſue joint meaſures with reſpect to the property ſold Meſs. Gomez, Lopez and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vera, as the intereſt of all parties naturally pointed out, and under this impreſſion addreſſed you on the 7th and 8th inſtant. Your anſwer ſatisfies us that you have no other object in view, than to induce us to take ſome ſteps that may place us in a ſituation of reſponſibility, which we do not think proper to incur. As to our having already ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ourſelves anſwerable for the amount of the ſales, we do not believe you ſincerely entertain the idea yourſelf. The only definite terms upon which you ever demanded the authorization, which is made the pretext of a miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding between us, and which are contained in your letter of the 12th June, are ſuch as we conceived ourſelves warranted in rejecting at that time, and have had no reaſon to change our opinion. The reaſons which influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced us have already been detailed and are too obvious to require repetition. To diſcuſs this point further will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be pleaſant nor uſeful. We are prepared to meet the queſtion in any ſhape you may chooſe to bring it forward, in full confidence of having diſcharged our truſt with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, and every proper attention to your intereſt, and a perfect reliance on thoſe tribunals which muſt ultimately decide between us. Under a conviction however, that it is your wiſh that we may aſſume a diſcretion which may eventually render us liable, we think proper to inform you that we ſhall not empower any houſe in Europe to receive any payment on the notes we hold, without an expreſs au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from you in writing for that purpoſe. Unleſs we receive explicit directions from you on this <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

this country, or until we receive advice that it is placed in Europe, ſo as to be commanded by us without any riſque. Your anſwer reſpecting an arbitration, is not leſs evaſive than other parts of your letter, but it is not ſurpriſing that ſuch ſhould be your language ſo long as you "feel tranquil about the event," and while you rely with ſo much confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on our guarantee in caſe of diſaſtrous conſequences We have only to add, that although a further correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will probably be productive of as ſalutary conſequences, yet we ſhall ever continue ready until the final ſettlement of this buſineſs, to liſten to ſuch inſtructions as you may have a right to give, and we conſiſtently with our own ſafety and intereſt purſue.</p>
