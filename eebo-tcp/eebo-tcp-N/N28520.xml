            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>THE affecting viciſſitudes of time are ſo many, and often ſo great, that to calculate their numbers, or eſtimate their conſequences, is beyond the power of man. Of theſe, every hour is pregnant, and every moment brings forth, while day and night ſpread them from Eaſt to Weſt, and the revolving ſeaſons, from pole to pole. By the ceaſeleſs progreſs of time, this world is continually paſſing; ſtates and kingdoms are diſſolved, and the vaſt arch of all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly empire finally falls.</p>

Coincident with theſe obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, are the mournful tidings that announce, as with the voice of dreadful thunder, that Waſhington is no more; a voice that ſtrikes the Continent into

                  <p>From the heavy news of our Hero's death, noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing can ſo rationally relieve, as a dependence on Him who made us; and to break our deep ſilence, no words can better aid our tongues, than, <hi>How is the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war periſhed!</hi> The good, the great, the mighty Waſhington is fallen! Nor did he fall alone: A political Father in the cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inet; a Hero in the field of battle; the Deliverer of his country, and a Friend to man, fell and were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tombed in Waſhington. His name ſhall be dear to us, and to our children—it ſhall not, it cannot be forgotten in America. Under deep impreſſions of the debt of gratitude, we owe the memory of the common Father of our country, we meet together this day to indulge a reaſonable grief, and drop a tear for him who is now no more. Contemplating the many bleſſings we enjoy, by the high inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentality of his valuable life; and the unequalled qualifications with which he was endowed for that end, we cannot help joining the Royal Penman of Iſrael, in repeating, <hi>How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war periſhed!</hi> Did David ſee a greatneſs in Saul and Jonathan? A greater than both is here.— Did he lament the loſs of an Abner, as a General of high qualities, and a Prince fallen in Iſrael? We lament the death of a General of far greater worth. Saul was given to Iſrael in wrath; but Waſhington to America in mercy. Abner was cruel—and in an unjuſt cauſe; but Waſhington in the cauſe of virtue, of reaſon, and of his country, was merciful. Did
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:037999_0004_100FB07188DA6738"/>
David indulge a reaſonable ſympathy with the Thouſands of Iſrael for the loſs of their Leaders in arms?—<hi>How are the weapons of war periſhed!</hi> As if he had ſaid; Who ſhall give ſtrength to Iſrael in the day of battle? Who ſhall wield the weapons of war with ſuch dexterity as Saul and Jonathan? With what ſuperior propriety may we uſe the emphatical exclamations: How is the ſword of America fallen! Where is the man whoſe preſence can enliven and rally her armies of defence like Waſhington's?— Who with equal influence, can collect the forces of our different ſtates into one?—Who with equal ſelf-poſſeſſion, magnanimity, and perſeverance, could lead an undiſciplined peaſantry, without arms or ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, againſt veteran troops, in ſcenes of action, through toils, through dangers, and through ſtreams of blood; to victory, to triumph, to glory, and to peace? Who with ſuperior wiſdom, could guide the car of ſtate, when riding high amidſt the jarring el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ements of contending nations, foreign influence, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic diviſions, and inſurrections?—When Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of well-meaning Americans would have thrown themſelves into the boſom of a diſorderly, hungry, and inſatiable nation, he wiſely and faithfully ſaved us from that deſtruction. How, O how is the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty fallen!—Bewail ye ſoldiers the loſs of your Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral —Bewail ye citizens the loſs of your political Father. Ye Fathers and Mothers, ye Sons and Daughters of America, bewail the fall of ſuch an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inent inſtrument for your defence.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Sunt lacrymae rerum, et mentem mortalia tangunt. <bibl>

                     <l>What mortal tidings pierce our hearts and ears!—</l>
                     <l>Tidings, extracting floods of public tears.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>But let not the tide of our grief ſwell to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate degree. Though the Hero of America is no more, the God that made him lives as the defence of his people; and gave Waſhington a good old age,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037999_0005_100FB0742B0F02A0"/>
and made him uſeful to the laſt day of his life.— For my own part, though I bewail the death of Waſhington, as the fall of the moſt honored man on earth; it is a conſolation, that he ſhall never be expoſed to the contempt incident to the frailties of helpleſs old age.</p>
                  <p>Waving on examination of the characters to which our text refers, and fully convinced the words are highly applicable to our deceaſed General: I ſhall conſider them as a proper ſubject, for illuſtrating, Firſt, The character of a great man: And, Secondly, That great men muſt fall in death. After which I will conclude with ſome uſeful reflections. I am,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To illuſtrate the character of a truly great man.</p>
                  <p>We would obſerve, that a great man muſt be a virtuous man. All the greatneſs that any of the moſt enterpriſing characters ever poſſeſſed, without virtue, is tarniſhed with vice: And vice has a meanneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low which no man can deſcend. The laurels of wicked men, however flouriſhing in the field of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, mildew and die, under the blaſting influence of vice, whether in public or private life.</p>
                  <p>What is the greatneſs of the Alexanders, the Pompeys, the Caeſars, and other celebrated warriors of antiquity? What is the greatneſs of many mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern Heroes? Where is their virtue? By what ſpirit are they animated? They are mere Catalines, and conſpirators, in compariſon to truly great men— They have ſounding titles of honor—They are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanely ſtill invincible—Conquerors of the world —Arbiters of peace and war—Defenders of their country, and the like—But in this, their names are tranſmitted to poſterity under the influence of a falſe blaze.—Their true characters are diſguiſed— Their ſecret deſigns are often baſe and mean, though covered with all the refinements of intrigue, of art, and of eloquence. Could we examine their conduct, and the motives by which ſuch are, and have been inſpired, we ſhould find that unbounded ambition,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037999_0006_100FB076D6B7A0C8"/>
cruel domination, inſolent pride and inſatiable ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice were the incentives of all their enterpriſes, and the mean and poiſonous ſprings of all their glory. A glory like this would be infamy to Waſhington.</p>
                  <p>A truly great man is inſpired with infinitely more noble motives: Motives flowing from a ſenſe of moral excellence; founded on a firm belief of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintending Providence of God, and the reality of religion, as tending to meliorate the heart, ennoble and dignify human nature; and attended with an earneſt deſire to eſtabliſh peace among mankind, as well as a reigning concern for the public good. At the call of God and his country, the great man buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles on his armor, leaves his delightful retirement, and enters the field of battle. The enemies he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes are pride, violence, injuſtice, perfidy and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potic ſway. To theſe he oppoſes a humble depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on Divine Providence, in the exerciſe of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence, juſtice and good government for man. With theſe, in the uſe of his weapons of war, he ſights againſt his enemy without revenge, conquers without haughtineſs, rejoices in triumph without inſolence, and gives God the praiſe. And while his hands are red with the blood of his enemies, his bowels melt, for the miſery of the victims of a juſt vengeance, and his heart reverences that God who commands in the day of ſuch a ſad neceſſity.</p>
                  <p>Numberleſs examples might be produced, from the experience of paſt ages, to ſhew, that virtue is neceſſary to the conſtitution of a great General. While the Roman Commanders, continued uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by vice, their empire, according to the ſignif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icant expreſſion of Daniel's prophecy, remained ſtrong as iron. The purity of their manners was one great cauſe of the ſucceſs of their arms; and the grandeur of their Commonwealth was the reward of their temperance, wiſdom, and national juſtice. But how ſadly the ſcene is changed, when the vices and follies of their conquered nations infected the hearts
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037999_0007_100FB0785E8B36C0"/>
of their Generals! Their iron immediately mingled with clay, the foundation of their government was ſoon overthrown, their courage degenerated into cowardice, and their once renowned legions were put to flight by troops of undiſciplined barbarians.</p>
                  <p>No one will deny that firmneſs and fortitude are neceſſary for the formation of a great character. But where ſhall we find them? The breaſt of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious is too polluted a reſidence for ſuch noble vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. "True fortitude is ſeen in great exploits, which juſtice warrants, and which wiſdom guides; all elſe is towering frenzy and diſtraction." A vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Commander may be laviſh of the lives of others, and fooliſhly throw away his own; but that can never give him any juſt claim to the appellation in our text. The practice of vice deſtroys the health of the body, and relaxes the vigor of the mind; fits the man for mean and mercenary actions, and tends to transform Heroes into effeminate cowards.</p>
                  <p>A truly great man ſubdues his own paſſions; is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with meekneſs and generous compaſſion even to his enemies. Slavery is admitted on all ſides to break the ſpirits of men, and equally unfits the human mind for the formation and execution of any great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns. What greater ſlavery, than to be ſubject to the licentious deſires of a vicious heart; and to the boiſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous commands of unruly paſſions? Solomon, that great and wiſe Prince, obſerved, "He who is ſlow to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his ſpirit, than he that taketh a City." A polite writer obſerves; "A coward has fought; and a coward has conquered; but a coward never forgave." To the ſame purpoſe another obſerves, to a ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful warrior, who had ſhewn uncommon clemency to the vanquiſhed; "Before, you had conquered all the world; but now you have more gloriouſly ſubdued yourſelf."</p>
                  <p>A really great character engages not in war, from hatred and revenge: To puſh a conqueſt to the grat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ification
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037999_0008_100FB07C5E28FA50"/>
of ſuch mean and rancorous paſſions, is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eign from his mind; and it is a certain indication of the contrary character. Humanity and benevolence are eſſential ingredients of his heart: And ſuch a General knows how to enlarge his glory, by ſetting bounds to his victories. Nor is he more ready to encounter a haughty foe in arms, than he is to do him good when by his valor he has ſubdued him to his mercy.</p>
                  <p>A clear head and a penetrating underſtanding, as well as a firm, virtuous, and courageous heart, are neceſſary to the conſtitution of a great character. Without theſe, the moſt virtuous and firm mind in high offices will be in danger of many errors. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable are thoſe ſituations, both in the field and cabinet, in which there may be neither precept nor example to direct men's conduct. In ſuch difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, if the firſt men in a nation are deſtitute of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources in their own minds, they may become an eaſy prey, with their country, to the devouring ſword of an enemy, the intrigues of foreign nations, or the deſtroying influence of domeſtic factions, diviſions, and "unreaſonable diſcontent." Men without any ſingular talents may walk ſecure, in private life, and be uſeful to their fellowcitizens; and ſhould they be even vicious, the injury may be principally to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: But when men without virtue and firmneſs, without wiſdom and ſagacity, are raiſed to command in the field, or to important ſeats in government; while the influence of their vice ſlides, with an eaſy deſcent, to the moral injury of the community; their errors in public conduct ariſing from pride and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition on the one hand, or from ignorance and want of judgment on the other, are productive of incalcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable calamities to their country. To this truth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny examples in hiſtory, both ſacred and profane, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt. And to the confirmation of this truth; what a ſtriking contraſt there is, between our great and beloved Waſhington, and the mighty plunderers and
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037999_0009_100FB080277EC378"/>
tyrants of Europe! If the latter have any ſafety for their guilty heads, from the juſt vengeance of their own injured country, it is in the arm and power of deſpotic ſway; but the former had a ſecurity in the conſcious rectitude of his conduct, and in the heart and affection of his country, which no length of time, nor change, can conſign to oblivion. The wickedly great, and falſely ſplendorous tyrants of the earth, have their fears in life, and the curſes of generations to come, in death; but our truly great Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton had our love in life—has our grateful remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance in death; and generations to come ſhall riſe up, and call him bleſſed.</p>
                  <p>To fill up a great character, knowledge of letters, of men and of the world is neceſſary. Innumerable are thoſe occurrences in life, eſpecially in eminent ſtations, in which ignorance or inexperience of theſe, betray either trepidation or raſhneſs of mind, very inconſiſtent with illuſtrious characters. Men inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with high offices reſemble a city <hi>ſet on a hill, which cannot be hid.</hi> Their elevated ſituation caſts a light around them, that exhibits equally to public view, their ignorance and their knowledge; their imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and their worth.</p>
                  <p>To theſe I add, that a ſenſe of religion is neceſſary to the formation of a truly great man. To honor men, as completely great, who are deſtitute of this high qualification, is certainly not judicious. The belief of the exiſtence of a Deity; our moral obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to him; the immortality of the ſoul; the importance of its ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt, are ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſable to the man we are deſcribing; that he who fails of this mental trait, fails of a really great mind, as much as time fails of being equal to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. He that conceives himſelf, according to our new philoſophiſts, as having done with life, when his breath is expired, muſt labor under a meanneſs of mind, that levels him with irrational animals, in point of duration. This blackeſt of French infidel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:037999_0010_100FB081ADE0C428"/>
deſtroys the beſt motives for action, and muſt at once unfit the mind for thoſe noble achievements that the man of real religion is inſpired to perform. He that circumſcribes the conſequences of his great actions within the narrow limits of a life that is but a hand breadth, or a ſpan; muſt fall as far beneath thoſe who act upon a theatre preparing for eternity, as this little opaque earth is inferior to the expand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed light of heaven.—There is no compariſon. While the <hi>former</hi> as ſoon as he is born, is beginning to die (and an attempt to act as a Hero may effect his death, and eternally bury his triumphs in non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſtence;) the <hi>latter,</hi> in dying only begins to live

                  <p>Of this laſt claſs of Heroes, we truſt was our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Waſhington: And to this, his patroniſing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, his diſcountenancing and reproving vice, his ſtrict regard for the ſabbath, his attention to public worſhip, with his reſpect for the miniſters of relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, and his own purity of conduct, atteſt.</p>
                  <p>That Waſhington was not of the Heroes who confine their views to the limits of time only, and that he had a deep ſenſe of the importance of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality and religion, is very evident from his own language, recorded in his affectionate farewell ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to the people of America; in which he has diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played, in the moſt maſterly manner, "the dignity of his mind, and the unrivalled benevolence of his heart." Thus ſays this great man:</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="12" facs="unknown:037999_0011_100FB0845A845098"/>"Of all the diſpoſitions and habits which lead to political proſperity, religion and morality are indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable ſupports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotiſm, who ſhould labor to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert theſe great pillars of human happineſs, theſe firmeſt props of the duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the pious man, ought to reſpect, and cheriſh them. A volume could not trace all their connexions with public and private felicity. Let it be ſimply aſked, where is the ſecurity for property, for reputation, for life, if a ſenſe of religious obligation deſert the oaths which are the inſtruments of inveſtigation in courts of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice? —Reaſon and experience both forbid us to expect, that national morality can prevail, in exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of religious principles."</p>
                  <p>We have another teſtimony of Waſhington's pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and regard for real religion, in the concluding paſſage of his Circular Addreſs, at the time when he reſigned his military command; which we inſert in his own words.</p>
                  <p>"I now make it my earneſt prayer that God would have you in his holy protection; that he would moſt graciouſly be pleaſed, to diſpoſe us all to do juſtice, to love mercy, and to demean ourſelves with that charity, humility, and pacific temper of mind, which were the characteriſtics of the divine Author of our bleſſed religion; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a humble imitation of whoſe example in theſe things, we can never hope to be a happy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion."</p>
                  <p>In fine, were I to give a ſummary of a real great man, I ſhould ſay, that he poſſeſſes a virtuous, firm, nobly generous and intrepid heart—a clear and pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etrating underſtanding—extenſive knowledge—con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate wiſdom and enterpriſe—unfeigned faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in high offices—a ſincere concern for the public good—accompanied with a juſt ſenſe of relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, and the ſuperintending Providence of God.—
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037999_0012_100FB085E497AD00"/>
Theſe are leading features of a great character. And if a ſingular dignity of manners and addreſs can add any thing to the above, they were all found in Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington.</p>
                  <p>From good authority,<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Fullerton, who reſided ten years in the vicinity of Mount Vernon.</note> I have been informed that in private life the General was regular in his family, to an exemplary degree. His words were few, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation was moral.—Hoſpitable to ſtrangers—Good to the poor—Sociable with his friend—Forgiving, though reſerved, to his enemy—An affectionate huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band —Kind to all—flattering to none—and familiar with few.</p>
                  <p>In viewing the moſt illuſtrious characters of other Heroes whether more ancient or modern, even their friends muſt draw a veil of tenderneſs over ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections in their conduct, while they applaud their virtues; but the character of our deceaſed General can bear a full examination, and appears ſpotleſs, as well as ſplendid, in the ſight of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
                  <p>The greatneſs and goodneſs of his mind evidences the care of a kind Providence towards America, in furniſhing him with ſuch abundant gifts for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming high ſervices to his country. A juſt ſenſe of his worth ſhould excite the exerciſe of correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent gratitude to God, who gave Waſhington to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica; while the ſame reflection deeply affects our minds, under an impreſſion of our important loſs in his death.</p>
                  <p>In his death, <hi>the mighty is fallen!</hi>—that diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed character which has drawn the attention, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the reſpect, and excited the admiration of kings and conquerors in Europe; and filled the minds of millions in America with joy. His mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory ſhall remain embalmed to poſterity, while the name of virtuous liberty ſhall have any friends on earth. <hi>How evident in his death, that great men muſt

What ſhall we conclude but, at thy command, O Death! the ſtars are final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blown out—and the ſun himſelf may ceaſe to ſhine.—What art thou? How ghaſtly thy looks! how cruel thy weapons! how extenſive thy domin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion! how deſpotic thy ſway! Whence art thou? that with equal eaſe, and lordly pride, doſt throw the prince from his throne, and the peaſant from his humble cottage? Art thou that cruel meſſenger, by whoſe unrelenting power the loving mother and tender babe, the indulgent huſband and beloved wife, are claſped in icy arms, and become the repaſt of worms and reptiles in the grave?—At thy control, the ſoldier and the citizen lie in undiſtinguiſhed ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; and a mighty Waſhington mingles kindred duſt on a level with the loweſt in the houſe of ſilence. Is it at the doleful tolling of thy bell, O Death, that we hear the ſound of thy grating inſtruments, covering the rich and the poor, the oppreſſor and the oppreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed deep in the duſt, to awake no more, till the morning of the reſurrection? By the ample ſweep of thine enormous ſcythe, the nations are cut off; and the number of the living is far inferior to that of the dead.</p>

                  <p>To the propriety of theſe obſervations, the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of inſpiration, and the experience of all ages fully aſſent. Long ſince, the doom of man was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by his Maker; "Of duſt thou art; and to the duſt ſhalt thou return." Our fathers are not, nor did the prophets live forever—We are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally informed that God will <hi>bring</hi> us <hi>to death;</hi> to the grave, <hi>the houſe oppointed for all living—Man in his beſt eſtate is vanity—His breath goeth forth; to his earth he
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037999_0014_100FB08C64737B60"/>
returns,</hi> and <hi>that day his thoughts periſh,</hi> as to us. <hi>All fleſh is as graſs and the glory of man is as the flower of the field; the wind paſſeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof knoweth it no more.</hi> Nor need we look for death only in the field of battle, in the billows of the ocean, nor in cities of peſtilence; the air we breathe, the food we eat, are fraught with death, and have quivers full of the arrows of deſtruction. To meet with death, we need not explore the wilds of the foreſt—expoſe ourſelves to the inclemency of ſtormy elements, nor wait years, and dread it only in old age; we ſee it in our common walks; it may follow us to our cloſet, it may arreſt us on the couch of repoſe; while it conſigns Thouſands from the breaſt and womb to the congregation of the dead. We are inceſſantly ſeeing <hi>man going to his long home, and the mourners going about the ſtreets.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us then improve the ſolemn diſpenſation that has called us together, as an incitement to prepare for our own death. Let us <hi>number our days ſo that we may apply our hearts unto wiſdom.</hi> The Proprietor of time has now cloſed another annual circle of days and months, and brought us to the beginning of that year, with which he ſhall ſhut up the ample round of the preſent, and which terminates in the commencement of another Century. Under ſuch important progreſſions he has cloſed the very uſeful life of our beloved Patriot. As we have received good by his life, let us now improve by his death. <hi>All things work together for good to them that love God.</hi> Let us be habitually and actually prepared for death. The diſappointments incident to us in the preſent world, are great and many. The changes that may come upon us in the preſent year may be ſuch as our wiſdom can neither foreſee, nor our power be able to prevent; though of the laſt importance to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and country. What may be hid in the womb of Providence with reſpect to us as individuals, who can tell? Who can aſcertain his preſervation from
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:037999_0015_100FB08F5C6FF010"/>
death for one month, one week, nay, for one hour? A few minutes may involve the mind of mortal man in a ſcene more important to him than Millions of worlds.</p>
                  <p>Let us then ſeaſonably contemplate the unknown regions of immortality, and look out for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the king of terrors. Can any of us baffle the power of death, ſince Waſhington is dead? Can honor, can affluence, can love of friends or of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, can an aſſemblage of virtues, or uſefulneſs in the world, can health of body, or ſtrength of mind ſave us from death, ſince He is no more? Can dignity of addreſs, a commanding appearance, added to the moſt brilliant achievements and the moſt ſplendid triumphs, avert the arrows of that inevitable Archer, ſince they have pierced the life of the higheſt Hero of America and of the world? Will death reſpect the moſt ſhining dreſs, the epaulette, the lace, the ſword or ſuperb habitation; ſince the ſhroud, the coffin, and the grave were prepared for Waſhington? Can our feeble efforts reſiſt the arreſt of death, ſince that arm which (under God) ſubdued fleets and armies, has yielded to its control. Under impreſſions of that high command, "Be ye alſo ready," may we prepare to follow, <hi>having our loins girded about, and our lights burning, and ourſelves like unto men that wait for their Lord.</hi> Let us look above, and beyond Waſhington, to Jeſus, the bleſſed author of our religion, who has deſtroyed death. In him, and in him only, we may glory over this king of terrors, and riſe ſuperior to his fears. In Jeſus we ſtand compoſed at his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and ſmile at the ſhaking of his ſpear. In Chriſt we may anticipate an enlightened chamber for death, and victory over the gloom of the grave. He has ſtripped death of its terrors.—He is <hi>the reſurrection and the life.</hi>—In him, <hi>life and immortality are brought to light by the goſpel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us improve this high diſpenſation, to guard us againſt every appearance of moral evil. To this leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

the example of the deceaſed, as well as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant voice of inſpiration, directs. Sin is the cauſe of death—<hi>Sin has entered the world, and death by ſin.</hi> While the pride, avarice, and ambition of many great men in the world, ſerve as ſhades to ſet off the character of our beloved Hero; that himſelf ſhould not live, is a ſtriking evidence of the dreadful nature of ſin in its mortal effects and conſequences over the beſt of men—We ſhall never be <hi>truly</hi> immortal, until we be <hi>really</hi> ſinleſs. And though ſuch a high attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is not the lot of any, even the beſt, in the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent life; it is however, our duty to ſhun ſin as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honorable to our Maker, injurious to ourſelves, and as greatly unfitting for anſwering the end of our crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this life, or enjoying real happineſs in that which is to come. It is only where there is no ſin, that there can be no ſorrow.</p>
                  <p>Let us alſo improve this moſt humbling Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, by way of gratitude to God, that at the moſt important criſis our country ever ſaw, we had not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Waſhington alive; but a Waſhington in the ſtrength of body, and vigor of mind, added to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of experience, which form the aggregate of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man life.</p>
                  <p>And when we contemplate the dangers to which the government of our country, has been, and is ſtill expoſed, from foreign influence, intrigues, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic faction; and at the ſame time realize our loſs in being bereaved of the man whoſe voice ſtilled the tumults of inſurrection; let us be thankful to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Ruler of the Univerſe, that our counſel in the cabinet and command in the field, are committed to ſuch able hands as an Adams, and a Hamilton—and let me add, to a Gilman, whom with pleaſure I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as a ſignal favor and ornament to our State.— May we never be deſtitute of ſuch emblems and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors of Waſhington to direct the affairs of our ſtate and nation. And may all ranks of citizens, in the

exerciſe of virtue, piety, and real religion, be influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by a ſpirit of knowledge, firmneſs, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to our country's good. Then, the happineſs of America may riſe, ſpread, and endure, till the ſtars ſhall ceaſe to ſhine.</p>

birth; to contemplate his illuſtrious life; and to condole and lament in his death. What a high aſſemblage of different emotions of joy and ſorrow, does the remembrance of his character in this view produce in our minds? An aſſemblage combining diſtant years, important events, and various achieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>On the 22<hi>d</hi> of February, 1732, our Friend, our Father, our Stateſman, our Hero was born—A day auſpicious to the Columbian world! a morning on which a day-ſtar aroſe in America!—an aera, which neither our children, nor ſucceeding generations ſhall ever forget, till time expires, and days ſhall be no more. Then was America honored! Then did Virginia, Weſtmoreland County, and Waſhington pariſh, become diſtinguiſhed ſpots of the earth.</p>
                  <p>No ſooner had WASHINGTON arrived at the age of twenty years, than the happy influence of his valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble life, bedewed the frontiers of his native ſtate. His diſcerning and grateful country clothed him with honorable commiſſions, and veſted him with plenary powers for a negotiation with her enemies. In diſcharging the duties of theſe youthful honors, he diſarmed the ſavage, and diſpoſed him for peace.</p>
                  <p>By his ſuperior penetration and proweſs, he diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed himſelf a bleſſing to his country, triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over Indian victory, in ſaving the remains of Braddock's defeated army, from the wanton cruelty of a barbarous foe. Theſe early and ſucceſsful exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were ominous of the future toils and dangers he endured; by which he preſerved his country from being a theatre of deſpotic diverſions for Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean tyrants, to be a garden of liberty for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican nation.</p>
                  <p>When the rights of freemen were variouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringed in America; when the chains of Britiſh ſlavery were cunningly hid in cheſts of tea; when a Gage, a Dunmore, with many others, ſtood ready to rivet the ſhackles, by which his country was to
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:037999_0021_100FB09FB157AEF0"/>
be violated; her chaſte cries reached his ears; he drew his ſword which never delighted in blood, and determined to ſave her. Neither affluence of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, nor the prejudices of Britain, high in his favor for paſt ſervices, could produce a ſingle heſitation. He riſks all, for love of country, of liberty, and of man. This principle drew him from his beloved and peaceful retirement. This principle induced him to renounce a life of private eaſe and honor; in which he was diſtinguiſhed as a Father to the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, the orphan's Shield, the ſtranger's ſtay and the widow's Judge; to be more eminently diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the field of Mars, for his country's general ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                  <p>At that diſtreſsful period, when every moment ſeemed pregnant with events more important than the productions of a century; we ſee WASHINGTON at the head of the American arms; elevated in ſight of the world, to the performance of command, perilous as <hi>riding the whirlwind,</hi> and arduous as <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting the ſtorms</hi> of heaven. His name carried order and government among his friends; and ſet bounds to the inſolence and arms of his enemies. The heights of Boſton can tell; and their warlike entrenchments can witneſs to his ſuperior Generalſhip. The abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, the valor, the unwearied fatigues of Long-Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, York-Iſland, and the Jerſeys; when WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON carried his young and inexperienced coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in his arms, with her countenance heavy, and her heart like to break, are proofs, that he, only grew brave by diſtreſs, and collected ſtrength from diſappointments. Undiſmayed by the threats of angry elements, in the ſtorms of winter, and in the higheſt ſwellings of the Delaware; unappalled by the ſmallneſs of his numbers, with the increaſe of ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery want; and facing a powerful well equipt and vet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eran foe; he marſhalled his little hoſt; he fired their ſouls with love of liberty; and by a ſingle effort of his high genius crumbled the overgrown pride of
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:037999_0022_100FB0A2627CE738"/>
his enemies to the duſt. By this unexpected and ſurpriſing victory, he revived the deſponding ſpirits of his country and invigorated her feeble arm for the field.</p>
                  <p>By his wiſdom in war, he often ſaved the blood of his countrymen; by retreats, triumphing over victory; converting the advances of his enemies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ambuſcades for their own deſtruction; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced them, their conqueſts and ſucceſſes were tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary and vain.</p>
                  <p>When we contemplate our American Hero at Brandywine, Germantown, and Monmouth; how undaunted, traverſing clouds of ſmoke, ſeas of blood, and tempeſts of fire!—His preſence ſupplying ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery want—animating every ſoul—bracing every nerve—and braving every danger. His voice in the hour of trial, was as ſight to the blind, ſtrength to the weak, courage to the fearful, and comfort to the dying.</p>
                  <p>Watched by the eagle eye of WASHINGTON, his enemies fly from City to City for reſt; and from State to State for territory, to no purpoſe. He ſoars aloft, alternately checks and purſues; until the laſt exertions of his potent foe for fighting or fleeing, are exhauſted. By a noble effort of his great abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and ſuperior talents in command over our aux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iliaries from a nation <hi>then</hi> our ally; with the army of America, he finally forced his enemies to ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to his clemency, as a Commander equally diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to commiſerate the vanquiſhed, as to ſubdue thoſe in arms; and to convince the power of Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ain of the neceſſity of turning her thoughts on peace.</p>
                  <p>Theſe, my fellowmen, are but an imperfect ſam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the heroic luſtre and ſplendid achievements, by which he directed the arms of America; until he evinced her importance, and weighed her indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence before an aſtoniſhed world, in the ſcale of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>When the olive branch ſucceeded the glitter of
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:037999_0023_100FB0A443985190"/>
arms, and the ſound of induſtry and agriculture, the thunders of the field of Mars; the Americans be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held WASHINGTON with delightful admiration, reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his high command into the hands of his beloved country, from whom he received it; and amidſt the applauding ſhouts of thouſands, returning to Mount Vernon, with the prayers of Millions for bleſſings perpetual to follow him. In the exerciſe of his high command, WASHINGTON convinced the wiſe, that he was more wiſe; the brave, that he was the moſt brave; but in his reſignation, the good, that he was the beſt. How far inferior are the Heroes of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, the convulſed ſtate of her nations can witneſs.</p>
                  <p>But though WASHINGTON had retired to the peaceful ſhades of private life; though America is deeply in arrears of gratitude for paſt ſervices; ſtill ſhe looks to him, as the man that muſt ſecure by his counſel in the cabinet, that independence which he had gained in the field, by his ſword. Poſſeſſing every qualification to finiſh the Stateſman, as well as the General, he is unanimouſly choſen Preſident of the Convention, which erected that noble ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, our federal Conſtitution. What ſagacity in reaſoning, penetration in judgment, and wiſdom in concluſion, guided the Convention over which he preſided, in rearing that ſtupendous fabric, is fully evinced by the happy effects America enjoys under its roof. To this ſtrong hold (under God) are we indebted for preſervation from the fury of domeſtic faction; and from the conqueſt of terror, and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, of foreign nations. It is under the covert of this all-protecting edifice, that our gaols are not thrown open by the hand of violence; that our Judges are not torn from the bench of juſtice; that our miniſters of morality and religion are not drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from their deſks; that places of public worſhip are not converted to play houſes, nor our precious ſabbaths to a French decade. It is under the banner of this ſtanding teſtimony of WASHINGTON'S abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:037999_0024_100FB0A5EE61CB68"/>
with thoſe of his copatriots, that we are ſafe from the ſtorms of endleſs revolutions, conſpiracies and intrigues; and that our wiſeſt ſtateſmen have not felt the dagger of the aſſaſſin, on the floor of Congreſs. It is rallying round this ſtandard of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional liberty, order and government, that our citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens are not robbed, our houſes not rifled, our fair not violated, our old men not miſerable; nor our tender infants deſtroyed on the point of the ſpear. And give me leave to add, it is under the arch of this mighty building, that America ſits yet in her own houſe, with her children around her; and calls them happy. Happy will they ſtill be, if they real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ize it, for it is the order of the family.</p>
                  <p>When the federal Conſtitution received the ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the people, America looks again to WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON, as the man, whom ſhe ſtill delights to hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or; and as worthy of her higheſt confidence in peace, as well as in war. He is unanimouſly choſen to hold the chief reins of government. At his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try's call, atteſted by the joy inſpired into all ranks of citizens at his election; he roſe from his ſeat of eaſe, on which he had been ſcarce allowed a moment's reſt; and in the exerciſe of ſelf-denial for her good, bowed to her requeſt; and with a diffidence peculiar to a mind equally great in itſelf, and unſullied by pride or diſſimulation, entered on his high office, with a dignified ſolemnity unknown before in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica. How well he diſcharged the duties of this high honor, the nations of the earth and the grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful heart of every honeſt American can witneſs.— His whole life ſeemed to indicate, that a ſpecial Prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idence had raiſed him up, and given him a rare aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblage of virtues, and powers of judgment, to perform a complicated variety of important ſervices; in defending his country in war; and refining and conſolidating her government in peace. Like a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus of light, in which all rays concentre; he poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whatever was noble, virtuous, and good in man.
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:037999_0025_100FB0AB35EC2360"/>
To our American Hero, as to the greateſt of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, has been, allotted the higheſt prize of human glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in running his race, without ſtumble, ſtain, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. The fame of his illuſtrious deeds has explored every region of the earth, and croſſed every latitude of the ocean. On WASHINGTON, as on a blazing comet, in the firmament of human ſtars, the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the different Zones have had their eyes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually ſet; and whether friends or enemies to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, have been his equal admirers. His name ſhall remain in the archives of the world, till the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of time ſhall ceaſe; and the ſublime poet, the lively limner, the curious engraver, and every artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer of monumental remembrance, will be proud to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit the moſt lively ſtroke of taſte, and the beſt teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of invention, to perpetuate the memory of WASHINGTON.</p>
                  <p>His ſword ſhall be the delight of the brave, and the wonder of the warrior, while arms are in uſe. And while earth is the habitation of man, the trav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eller —Indian—Foreigner—or American; as he paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es Mount Vernon, will ſtop; make a ſolemn pauſe! and his commemorating ſoliloquy ſhall be, There is the honored reſidence of the FATHER of his Country, the DEFENDER of her Rights, and the BENEFACTOR of man. When the good, the great, the learned, or illiterate, the ſoldier or citizen, look at the tomb of WASHINGTON, they will drop the generous tear on his urn, while the memory of his virtues and valor enlivens their innate reſpect for his duſt and aſhes.</p>
                  <p>But alas, he is no more! We are bereaved of WASHINGTON forever! For this, our country utters her groans of grief, and is deeply ſorry. For this, the chair of her ſtate, and the deſk of her temple are ſhrouded in ſable—For this, the hilt of her ſword, and the arm of her citizen, are clothed in crape— For this, her drums are muffled, her trumpets are hoarſe, and her muſic mourns. And for this her national fortitude ſtands this day in arms reverſed,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:037999_0026_100FB0AF01CB55D8"/>
not aſhamed of the tear of heavy wo on her cheek. Let us condole with her. If our hearts are not ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant; if our eyes are not flint; they will melt, they will weep for WASHINGTON. To melt is pleaſant, to weep is manly; to forget him is ingratitude of the blackeſt hue; and to be indifferent under ſuch a high diſpenſation, is impious inſenſibility.</p>
                  <p>At his birth, the pillars of tyranny trembled; in his life, kings and conquerors darkened under his ſuperior luſtre; and at his death, the nations mourn. If the united abilities that accompliſh the General, Patriot, and Stateſman, could have baffled the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of death, WASHINGTON had never died. If the united prayers of the virtuous in America, from his Excellency ADAMS, to the loweſt citizen, could have availed, WASHINGTON were yet alive. And the moſt expreſſive tokens of reſpect, from the firſt characters in the different quarters of the world, to WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON, authorize me to ſay; that if the deſires of the good and the great, in Europe, Aſia, and Africa, added to the tears of the tawny tribes to the weſtern Ocean, could have ſoftened the king of terrors, our AMERICAN CHIEF were yet ſpared. But he is gone forever from us—we ſhall hear his voice no more— To us, in this ſtupendous diſpenſation,

<pb n="29" facs="unknown:037999_0027_100FB0B0ADCD76C0"/>
hid forever from our ſight. Had this awful Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence taken place in America, when his arm was her ſupport in the field of ſtruggle and diſtreſs; and when one ſtumble in his walk would have made her heart tremble, and her countenance ſad; who can ſay, that we, with our little ones, might not ſit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, under the darkneſs of monarchial government, in the ſackcloth of ſlavery. Thank Heaven, it was otherwiſe ordered; and while ſubmiſſion to the high decree of his deceaſe ſhould humble every American in the duſt, every heart ſhould mingle gratitude with mourning, that heaven has ſpared his illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous life ſo long.</p>
                  <p>Let us not forget the memory of our beloved WASHINGTON; and it will not ceaſe to do us good. In his life, we have a combination of examples for all claſſes of citizens, from the chief ſeat of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to the humble peaſant. In the firmneſs of his integrity, wiſdom of his adminiſtration, dignity of his manners, with his unremitted concern for the public good; we have a noble example for every deſcription of public officers. In the pious good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his heart, illuſtrated by the juſtice, temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, tender benevolence, and univerſal correctneſs and purity of his manners in private life; we have all an example in WASHINGTON for living; and in his magnanimous, reſigned compoſure in death, a precious example for dying. The latter fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords with the former. General GEORGE WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON died in the full poſſeſſion of his reaſon, without a groan, though in extreme diſtreſs; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly reſigned to the will of heaven, and ready to wing his way from this vale of tears, we truſt, to the manſions of bliſs, and endleſs repoſe. May a deep impreſſion of our common Father's memory, excite millions of his extenſive family to be like him, pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, brave, virtuous, wiſe, and good!</p>

                  <head>MEMORANDUM.</head>
                  <p>THIS great man's anceſtors came from Old England, in the year <hi>1657.</hi> He is of the third deſcent after their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration, the firſt fruit of a ſecond marriage; born on the <hi>22</hi>d February, <hi>1732,</hi> in the pariſh of Waſhington, Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moreland county, Virginia. His Father's family was numerous.—His education was principally managed by a private Tutor, which has been often the caſe in families of diſtinction in Virginia. His Father died when he was but ten years of age.</p>
                  <p>In the fifteenth year of his age he had determined to go to ſea; and had his baggage prepared for embarkation; but through the reluctance of his ſurviving parent to a ſeafaring life, he relinquiſhed his determination.</p>
                  <p>When he was in the twentieth year of his age, he was honored with a Major's commiſſion.—In his twenty ſecond year, he was inveſted with plenary powers to negociate with the French and Canadians, who were making inroads on the frontiers of the Britiſh Colonies.—He fulfilled the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of his miſſion with ſingular induſtry, intelligence, and addreſs.—It is ſaid his journals were publiſhed to the world and announced, at that early time of his life, the greatneſs of mind and correct manner of doing buſineſs, which have ſince characterized him in the management of more ardu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous undertakings.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>1755,</hi> he ſaved the broken remains of Braddock's defeated army, at Fort Duqueſne.—But innumerable, and too tedious to mention, were the hardſhips he endured, and the plans he deviſed, to defend the frontiers during the war with France.</p>
                  <p>Peace being reſtored to the middle colonies in <hi>1758,</hi> and his health having been greatly injured by the war, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned his commiſſion the year following.—</p>
                  <p>After his health was gradually reſtored, he married an amiable widow of merit and wealth, with whom he has no iſſue.—He was often choſen by the ſuffrages of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low citizens to fill a ſeat in the General Aſſembly of Virginia. —He was Magiſtrate in his county, and Judge of the Court.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="31" facs="unknown:037999_0029_100FB0B3C47CC5F0"/>In <hi>1774,</hi> he was choſen a Member of the firſt American Congreſs—And the year following, Commander in Chief of the American Forces.—With what conſummate abilities he formed a body of peaſantry to a regular army, and fit to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter the flower of veteran troops, remains unparalleled in the annals of paſt ages, and will remain the admiration of the world for ages to come.</p>
                  <p>At the cloſe of the war, he reſigned his command and retired to his ſeat in Virginia—Multitudes thronged his paſſage, both in city and in country, hailing him as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver of their liberties, the giver of their independence, and the reſtorer of peace.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>1787,</hi> He was elected a member of the Federal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, and its Preſident, while framing the federal Conſtitution, under which we now may ſo happily live.— In <hi>1789,</hi> he was unanimouſly choſen Preſident of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited States of America, and inducted into office on the <hi>30</hi>th of April, in the City of New York in the gallery of the federal Hall in the view of thouſands of ſpectators.— The oath was adminiſtered by Chancellor Livingſton. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral circumſtances concurred to render this ceremony un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſually ſolemn—The preſence of the Father and Deliverer of his country—The impreſſion of gratitude for paſt ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces—The vaſt concourſe of ſpectators—The devout and reverential manner in which he bowed, and in which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the oath; together with the conſideration of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing choſen to the moſt dignified office in America, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in the world, by the unanimous voice of more than three Millions of enlightened freemen; all conſpired to place this among the moſt auguſt and intereſting ſcenes which have ever been exhibited on the theatre of time. A ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of this ſcene was ſo ſtruck with the ſolemnity of it, as an appeal to heaven and earth at once, that when the Chancellor pronounced, <hi>LONG LIVE GEORGE WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON,</hi> his ſenſibility was wound up to ſuch a pitch, that he could only wave his hat without being able to join one word in the repeated acclamations that rent the air.— To this office he was rechoſen until he finally declined a re-election; at which time he formed an addreſs which for
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:037999_0030_100FB0B670497340"/>
wiſdom of policy, juſtneſs of thought, perſpicuity of ſtyle and purity of language, is ſecond to none, nor equalled by any. This addreſs is recommended to us now as the legacy of a political father to his family; and we are juſtly told to read it, and to read it aloud that all the houſe may hear.<note n="*" place="bottom">The principal part of the preceding <hi>Memorandum</hi> is extracted from Dr. Morſe's Geography, and is here inſerted for the uſe of thoſe who may have few means or opportunities of information on this moſt intereſting ſubject.</note>

                  <p>We add; his care for his country's good is very evident in his laſt public act of condeſcenſion in accepting the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of Lieut. General of the American army; which office he has reſigned with his life; which we are informed took place as follows. On Friday, the day before he died, he ſpent ſome time in marking a gravel walk which he had in contemplation, on the banks of the Potowmac.—There came a fall of ſnow which did not deter him from his purſuit.—He continued till his neck and hair were quite covered with ſnow. He ſpent the evening with Mrs. Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, reading the newſpapers;—went to bed as uſual a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout nine of the clock—waked in the night very unwell.— In the morning finding himſelf ſtill ſo—ſent for Dr. Craik of Alexandria. Soon after his arrival, two conſulting Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians were ſent for, but all to no purpoſe.—His diſorder would not yield to medicine; and by twelve of the clock at night on Saturday, the <hi>14</hi>th of December, <hi>1799</hi>—expired without a groan—in the <hi>68</hi>th year of his age. He ſaid a few minutes before his death, "Bury me decently, and not till two days after my deceaſe."—To Dr. Craik he ſaid: "I die a very hard death, but I am not afraid to die."— Before he breathed his laſt, he laid himſelf on his back, placed his hands before him, and cloſed his own mouth and eyes.</p>
