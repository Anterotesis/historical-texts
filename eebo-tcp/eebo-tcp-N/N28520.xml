            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>THE affecting viciÅ¿Å¿itudes of time are Å¿o many, and often Å¿o great, that to calculate their numbers, or eÅ¿timate their conÅ¿equences, is beyond the power of man. Of theÅ¿e, every hour is pregnant, and every moment brings forth, while day and night Å¿pread them from EaÅ¿t to WeÅ¿t, and the revolving Å¿eaÅ¿ons, from pole to pole. By the ceaÅ¿eleÅ¿s progreÅ¿s of time, this world is continually paÅ¿Å¿ing; Å¿tates and kingdoms are diÅ¿Å¿olved, and the vaÅ¿t arch of all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly empire finally falls.</p>

Coincident with theÅ¿e obÅ¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, are the mournful tidings that announce, as with the voice of dreadful thunder, that WaÅ¿hington is no more; a voice that Å¿trikes the Continent into

                  <p>From the heavy news of our Hero's death, noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing can Å¿o rationally relieve, as a dependence on Him who made us; and to break our deep Å¿ilence, no words can better aid our tongues, than, <hi>How is the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war periÅ¿hed!</hi> The good, the great, the mighty WaÅ¿hington is fallen! Nor did he fall alone: A political Father in the cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inet; a Hero in the field of battle; the Deliverer of his country, and a Friend to man, fell and were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tombed in WaÅ¿hington. His name Å¿hall be dear to us, and to our childrenâit Å¿hall not, it cannot be forgotten in America. Under deep impreÅ¿Å¿ions of the debt of gratitude, we owe the memory of the common Father of our country, we meet together this day to indulge a reaÅ¿onable grief, and drop a tear for him who is now no more. Contemplating the many bleÅ¿Å¿ings we enjoy, by the high inÅ¿tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentality of his valuable life; and the unequalled qualifications with which he was endowed for that end, we cannot help joining the Royal Penman of IÅ¿rael, in repeating, <hi>How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war periÅ¿hed!</hi> Did David Å¿ee a greatneÅ¿s in Saul and Jonathan? A greater than both is here.â Did he lament the loÅ¿s of an Abner, as a General of high qualities, and a Prince fallen in IÅ¿rael? We lament the death of a General of far greater worth. Saul was given to IÅ¿rael in wrath; but WaÅ¿hington to America in mercy. Abner was cruelâand in an unjuÅ¿t cauÅ¿e; but WaÅ¿hington in the cauÅ¿e of virtue, of reaÅ¿on, and of his country, was merciful. Did
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:037999_0004_100FB07188DA6738"/>
David indulge a reaÅ¿onable Å¿ympathy with the ThouÅ¿ands of IÅ¿rael for the loÅ¿s of their Leaders in arms?â<hi>How are the weapons of war periÅ¿hed!</hi> As if he had Å¿aid; Who Å¿hall give Å¿trength to IÅ¿rael in the day of battle? Who Å¿hall wield the weapons of war with Å¿uch dexterity as Saul and Jonathan? With what Å¿uperior propriety may we uÅ¿e the emphatical exclamations: How is the Å¿word of America fallen! Where is the man whoÅ¿e preÅ¿ence can enliven and rally her armies of defence like WaÅ¿hington's?â Who with equal influence, can collect the forces of our different Å¿tates into one?âWho with equal Å¿elf-poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion, magnanimity, and perÅ¿everance, could lead an undiÅ¿ciplined peaÅ¿antry, without arms or ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, againÅ¿t veteran troops, in Å¿cenes of action, through toils, through dangers, and through Å¿treams of blood; to victory, to triumph, to glory, and to peace? Who with Å¿uperior wiÅ¿dom, could guide the car of Å¿tate, when riding high amidÅ¿t the jarring el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ements of contending nations, foreign influence, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meÅ¿tic diviÅ¿ions, and inÅ¿urrections?âWhen Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ands of well-meaning Americans would have thrown themÅ¿elves into the boÅ¿om of a diÅ¿orderly, hungry, and inÅ¿atiable nation, he wiÅ¿ely and faithfully Å¿aved us from that deÅ¿truction. How, O how is the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty fallen!âBewail ye Å¿oldiers the loÅ¿s of your Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral âBewail ye citizens the loÅ¿s of your political Father. Ye Fathers and Mothers, ye Sons and Daughters of America, bewail the fall of Å¿uch an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inent inÅ¿trument for your defence.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>But let not the tide of our grief Å¿well to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate degree. Though the Hero of America is no more, the God that made him lives as the defence of his people; and gave WaÅ¿hington a good old age,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037999_0005_100FB0742B0F02A0"/>
and made him uÅ¿eful to the laÅ¿t day of his life.â For my own part, though I bewail the death of WaÅ¿hington, as the fall of the moÅ¿t honored man on earth; it is a conÅ¿olation, that he Å¿hall never be expoÅ¿ed to the contempt incident to the frailties of helpleÅ¿s old age.</p>
                  <p>Waving on examination of the characters to which our text refers, and fully convinced the words are highly applicable to our deceaÅ¿ed General: I Å¿hall conÅ¿ider them as a proper Å¿ubject, for illuÅ¿trating, FirÅ¿t, The character of a great man: And, Secondly, That great men muÅ¿t fall in death. After which I will conclude with Å¿ome uÅ¿eful reflections. I am,</p>
                  <p>FirÅ¿t, To illuÅ¿trate the character of a truly great man.</p>
                  <p>We would obÅ¿erve, that a great man muÅ¿t be a virtuous man. All the greatneÅ¿s that any of the moÅ¿t enterpriÅ¿ing characters ever poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed, without virtue, is tarniÅ¿hed with vice: And vice has a meanneÅ¿s, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low which no man can deÅ¿cend. The laurels of wicked men, however flouriÅ¿hing in the field of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, mildew and die, under the blaÅ¿ting influence of vice, whether in public or private life.</p>
                  <p>What is the greatneÅ¿s of the Alexanders, the Pompeys, the CaeÅ¿ars, and other celebrated warriors of antiquity? What is the greatneÅ¿s of many mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern Heroes? Where is their virtue? By what Å¿pirit are they animated? They are mere Catalines, and conÅ¿pirators, in compariÅ¿on to truly great menâ They have Å¿ounding titles of honorâThey are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanely Å¿till invincibleâConquerors of the world âArbiters of peace and warâDefenders of their country, and the likeâBut in this, their names are tranÅ¿mitted to poÅ¿terity under the influence of a falÅ¿e blaze.âTheir true characters are diÅ¿guiÅ¿edâ Their Å¿ecret deÅ¿igns are often baÅ¿e and mean, though covered with all the refinements of intrigue, of art, and of eloquence. Could we examine their conduct, and the motives by which Å¿uch are, and have been inÅ¿pired, we Å¿hould find that unbounded ambition,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037999_0006_100FB076D6B7A0C8"/>
cruel domination, inÅ¿olent pride and inÅ¿atiable ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice were the incentives of all their enterpriÅ¿es, and the mean and poiÅ¿onous Å¿prings of all their glory. A glory like this would be infamy to WaÅ¿hington.</p>
                  <p>A truly great man is inÅ¿pired with infinitely more noble motives: Motives flowing from a Å¿enÅ¿e of moral excellence; founded on a firm belief of the Å¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintending Providence of God, and the reality of religion, as tending to meliorate the heart, ennoble and dignify human nature; and attended with an earneÅ¿t deÅ¿ire to eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h peace among mankind, as well as a reigning concern for the public good. At the call of God and his country, the great man buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles on his armor, leaves his delightful retirement, and enters the field of battle. The enemies he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿es are pride, violence, injuÅ¿tice, perfidy and deÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potic Å¿way. To theÅ¿e he oppoÅ¿es a humble depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on Divine Providence, in the exerciÅ¿e of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence, juÅ¿tice and good government for man. With theÅ¿e, in the uÅ¿e of his weapons of war, he Å¿ights againÅ¿t his enemy without revenge, conquers without haughtineÅ¿s, rejoices in triumph without inÅ¿olence, and gives God the praiÅ¿e. And while his hands are red with the blood of his enemies, his bowels melt, for the miÅ¿ery of the victims of a juÅ¿t vengeance, and his heart reverences that God who commands in the day of Å¿uch a Å¿ad neceÅ¿Å¿ity.</p>
                  <p>NumberleÅ¿s examples might be produced, from the experience of paÅ¿t ages, to Å¿hew, that virtue is neceÅ¿Å¿ary to the conÅ¿titution of a great General. While the Roman Commanders, continued uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by vice, their empire, according to the Å¿ignif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icant expreÅ¿Å¿ion of Daniel's prophecy, remained Å¿trong as iron. The purity of their manners was one great cauÅ¿e of the Å¿ucceÅ¿s of their arms; and the grandeur of their Commonwealth was the reward of their temperance, wiÅ¿dom, and national juÅ¿tice. But how Å¿adly the Å¿cene is changed, when the vices and follies of their conquered nations infected the hearts

of their Generals! Their iron immediately mingled with clay, the foundation of their government was Å¿oon overthrown, their courage degenerated into cowardice, and their once renowned legions were put to flight by troops of undiÅ¿ciplined barbarians.</p>
                  <p>No one will deny that firmneÅ¿s and fortitude are neceÅ¿Å¿ary for the formation of a great character. But where Å¿hall we find them? The breaÅ¿t of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious is too polluted a reÅ¿idence for Å¿uch noble vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. "True fortitude is Å¿een in great exploits, which juÅ¿tice warrants, and which wiÅ¿dom guides; all elÅ¿e is towering frenzy and diÅ¿traction." A vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Commander may be laviÅ¿h of the lives of others, and fooliÅ¿hly throw away his own; but that can never give him any juÅ¿t claim to the appellation in our text. The practice of vice deÅ¿troys the health of the body, and relaxes the vigor of the mind; fits the man for mean and mercenary actions, and tends to transform Heroes into effeminate cowards.</p>
                  <p>A truly great man Å¿ubdues his own paÅ¿Å¿ions; is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with meekneÅ¿s and generous compaÅ¿Å¿ion even to his enemies. Slavery is admitted on all Å¿ides to break the Å¿pirits of men, and equally unfits the human mind for the formation and execution of any great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿igns. What greater Å¿lavery, than to be Å¿ubject to the licentious deÅ¿ires of a vicious heart; and to the boiÅ¿ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous commands of unruly paÅ¿Å¿ions? Solomon, that great and wiÅ¿e Prince, obÅ¿erved, "He who is Å¿low to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his Å¿pirit, than he that taketh a City." A polite writer obÅ¿erves; "A coward has fought; and a coward has conquered; but a coward never forgave." To the Å¿ame purpoÅ¿e another obÅ¿erves, to a Å¿ucceÅ¿s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful warrior, who had Å¿hewn uncommon clemency to the vanquiÅ¿hed; "Before, you had conquered all the world; but now you have more gloriouÅ¿ly Å¿ubdued yourÅ¿elf."</p>
                  <p>A really great character engages not in war, from hatred and revenge: To puÅ¿h a conqueÅ¿t to the grat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ification
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037999_0008_100FB07C5E28FA50"/>
of Å¿uch mean and rancorous paÅ¿Å¿ions, is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eign from his mind; and it is a certain indication of the contrary character. Humanity and benevolence are eÅ¿Å¿ential ingredients of his heart: And Å¿uch a General knows how to enlarge his glory, by Å¿etting bounds to his victories. Nor is he more ready to encounter a haughty foe in arms, than he is to do him good when by his valor he has Å¿ubdued him to his mercy.</p>
                  <p>A clear head and a penetrating underÅ¿tanding, as well as a firm, virtuous, and courageous heart, are neceÅ¿Å¿ary to the conÅ¿titution of a great character. Without theÅ¿e, the moÅ¿t virtuous and firm mind in high offices will be in danger of many errors. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable are thoÅ¿e Å¿ituations, both in the field and cabinet, in which there may be neither precept nor example to direct men's conduct. In Å¿uch difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, if the firÅ¿t men in a nation are deÅ¿titute of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ources in their own minds, they may become an eaÅ¿y prey, with their country, to the devouring Å¿word of an enemy, the intrigues of foreign nations, or the deÅ¿troying influence of domeÅ¿tic factions, diviÅ¿ions, and "unreaÅ¿onable diÅ¿content." Men without any Å¿ingular talents may walk Å¿ecure, in private life, and be uÅ¿eful to their fellowcitizens; and Å¿hould they be even vicious, the injury may be principally to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves: But when men without virtue and firmneÅ¿s, without wiÅ¿dom and Å¿agacity, are raiÅ¿ed to command in the field, or to important Å¿eats in government; while the influence of their vice Å¿lides, with an eaÅ¿y deÅ¿cent, to the moral injury of the community; their errors in public conduct ariÅ¿ing from pride and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition on the one hand, or from ignorance and want of judgment on the other, are productive of incalcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable calamities to their country. To this truth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny examples in hiÅ¿tory, both Å¿acred and profane, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teÅ¿t. And to the confirmation of this truth; what a Å¿triking contraÅ¿t there is, between our great and beloved WaÅ¿hington, and the mighty plunderers and
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037999_0009_100FB080277EC378"/>
tyrants of Europe! If the latter have any Å¿afety for their guilty heads, from the juÅ¿t vengeance of their own injured country, it is in the arm and power of deÅ¿potic Å¿way; but the former had a Å¿ecurity in the conÅ¿cious rectitude of his conduct, and in the heart and affection of his country, which no length of time, nor change, can conÅ¿ign to oblivion. The wickedly great, and falÅ¿ely Å¿plendorous tyrants of the earth, have their fears in life, and the curÅ¿es of generations to come, in death; but our truly great WaÅ¿hing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton had our love in lifeâhas our grateful remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance in death; and generations to come Å¿hall riÅ¿e up, and call him bleÅ¿Å¿ed.</p>
                  <p>To fill up a great character, knowledge of letters, of men and of the world is neceÅ¿Å¿ary. Innumerable are thoÅ¿e occurrences in life, eÅ¿pecially in eminent Å¿tations, in which ignorance or inexperience of theÅ¿e, betray either trepidation or raÅ¿hneÅ¿s of mind, very inconÅ¿iÅ¿tent with illuÅ¿trious characters. Men inveÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with high offices reÅ¿emble a city <hi>Å¿et on a hill, which cannot be hid.</hi> Their elevated Å¿ituation caÅ¿ts a light around them, that exhibits equally to public view, their ignorance and their knowledge; their imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and their worth.</p>
                  <p>To theÅ¿e I add, that a Å¿enÅ¿e of religion is neceÅ¿Å¿ary to the formation of a truly great man. To honor men, as completely great, who are deÅ¿titute of this high qualification, is certainly not judicious. The belief of the exiÅ¿tence of a Deity; our moral obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to him; the immortality of the Å¿oul; the importance of its Å¿alvation by JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, are Å¿o in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diÅ¿penÅ¿able to the man we are deÅ¿cribing; that he who fails of this mental trait, fails of a really great mind, as much as time fails of being equal to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. He that conceives himÅ¿elf, according to our new philoÅ¿ophiÅ¿ts, as having done with life, when his breath is expired, muÅ¿t labor under a meanneÅ¿s of mind, that levels him with irrational animals, in point of duration. This blackeÅ¿t of French infidel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:037999_0010_100FB081ADE0C428"/>
deÅ¿troys the beÅ¿t motives for action, and muÅ¿t at once unfit the mind for thoÅ¿e noble achievements that the man of real religion is inÅ¿pired to perform. He that circumÅ¿cribes the conÅ¿equences of his great actions within the narrow limits of a life that is but a hand breadth, or a Å¿pan; muÅ¿t fall as far beneath thoÅ¿e who act upon a theatre preparing for eternity, as this little opaque earth is inferior to the expand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed light of heaven.âThere is no compariÅ¿on. While the <hi>former</hi> as Å¿oon as he is born, is beginning to die (and an attempt to act as a Hero may effect his death, and eternally bury his triumphs in non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiÅ¿tence;) the <hi>latter,</hi> in dying only begins to live

                  <p>Of this laÅ¿t claÅ¿s of Heroes, we truÅ¿t was our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved WaÅ¿hington: And to this, his patroniÅ¿ing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, his diÅ¿countenancing and reproving vice, his Å¿trict regard for the Å¿abbath, his attention to public worÅ¿hip, with his reÅ¿pect for the miniÅ¿ters of relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, and his own purity of conduct, atteÅ¿t.</p>
                  <p>That WaÅ¿hington was not of the Heroes who confine their views to the limits of time only, and that he had a deep Å¿enÅ¿e of the importance of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality and religion, is very evident from his own language, recorded in his affectionate farewell ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreÅ¿s to the people of America; in which he has diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played, in the moÅ¿t maÅ¿terly manner, "the dignity of his mind, and the unrivalled benevolence of his heart." Thus Å¿ays this great man:</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="12" facs="unknown:037999_0011_100FB0845A845098"/>"Of all the diÅ¿poÅ¿itions and habits which lead to political proÅ¿perity, religion and morality are indiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penÅ¿able Å¿upports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotiÅ¿m, who Å¿hould labor to Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert theÅ¿e great pillars of human happineÅ¿s, theÅ¿e firmeÅ¿t props of the duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the pious man, ought to reÅ¿pect, and cheriÅ¿h them. A volume could not trace all their connexions with public and private felicity. Let it be Å¿imply aÅ¿ked, where is the Å¿ecurity for property, for reputation, for life, if a Å¿enÅ¿e of religious obligation deÅ¿ert the oaths which are the inÅ¿truments of inveÅ¿tigation in courts of juÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice? âReaÅ¿on and experience both forbid us to expect, that national morality can prevail, in exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion of religious principles."</p>
                  <p>We have another teÅ¿timony of WaÅ¿hington's pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and regard for real religion, in the concluding paÅ¿Å¿age of his Circular AddreÅ¿s, at the time when he reÅ¿igned his military command; which we inÅ¿ert in his own words.</p>
                  <p>"I now make it my earneÅ¿t prayer that God would have you in his holy protection; that he would moÅ¿t graciouÅ¿ly be pleaÅ¿ed, to diÅ¿poÅ¿e us all to do juÅ¿tice, to love mercy, and to demean ourÅ¿elves with that charity, humility, and pacific temper of mind, which were the characteriÅ¿tics of the divine Author of our bleÅ¿Å¿ed religion; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a humble imitation of whoÅ¿e example in theÅ¿e things, we can never hope to be a happy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion."</p>
                  <p>In fine, were I to give a Å¿ummary of a real great man, I Å¿hould Å¿ay, that he poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿es a virtuous, firm, nobly generous and intrepid heartâa clear and pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etrating underÅ¿tandingâextenÅ¿ive knowledgeâcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ummate wiÅ¿dom and enterpriÅ¿eâunfeigned faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneÅ¿s in high officesâa Å¿incere concern for the public goodâaccompanied with a juÅ¿t Å¿enÅ¿e of relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, and the Å¿uperintending Providence of God.â

TheÅ¿e are leading features of a great character. And if a Å¿ingular dignity of manners and addreÅ¿s can add any thing to the above, they were all found in WaÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington.</p>
                  <p>From good authority,<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Fullerton, who reÅ¿ided ten years in the vicinity of Mount Vernon.</note> I have been informed that in private life the General was regular in his family, to an exemplary degree.

                  <p>In viewing the moÅ¿t illuÅ¿trious characters of other Heroes whether more ancient or modern, even their friends muÅ¿t draw a veil of tenderneÅ¿s over Å¿ome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections in their conduct, while they applaud their virtues; but the character of our deceaÅ¿ed General can bear a full examination, and appears Å¿potleÅ¿s, as well as Å¿plendid, in the Å¿ight of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
                  <p>The greatneÅ¿s and goodneÅ¿s of his mind evidences the care of a kind Providence towards America, in furniÅ¿hing him with Å¿uch abundant gifts for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming high Å¿ervices to his country.

To meet with death, we need not explore the wilds of the foreÅ¿tâexpoÅ¿e ourÅ¿elves to the inclemency of Å¿tormy elements, nor wait years, and dread it only in old age; we Å¿ee it in our common walks; it may follow us to our cloÅ¿et, it may arreÅ¿t us on the couch of repoÅ¿e; while it conÅ¿igns ThouÅ¿ands from the breaÅ¿t and womb to the congregation of the dead.

Under Å¿uch important progreÅ¿Å¿ions he has cloÅ¿ed the very uÅ¿eful life of our beloved Patriot.

The diÅ¿appointments incident to us in the preÅ¿ent world, are great and many.

death for one month, one week, nay, for one hour? A few minutes may involve the mind of mortal man in a Å¿cene more important to him than Millions of worlds.</p>
                  <p>Let us then Å¿eaÅ¿onably contemplate the unknown regions of immortality, and look out for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the king of terrors. Can any of us baffle the power of death, Å¿ince WaÅ¿hington is dead?

Will death reÅ¿pect the moÅ¿t Å¿hining dreÅ¿s, the epaulette, the lace, the Å¿word or Å¿uperb habitation; Å¿ince the Å¿hroud, the coffin, and the grave were prepared for WaÅ¿hington? Can our feeble efforts reÅ¿iÅ¿t the arreÅ¿t of death, Å¿ince that arm which (under God) Å¿ubdued fleets and armies, has yielded to its control. Under impreÅ¿Å¿ions of that high command, "Be ye alÅ¿o ready," may we prepare to follow, <hi>having our loins girded about, and our lights burning, and ourÅ¿elves like unto men that wait for their Lord.</hi> Let us look above, and beyond WaÅ¿hington, to JeÅ¿us, the bleÅ¿Å¿ed author of our religion, who has deÅ¿troyed death. In him, and in him only, we may glory over this king of terrors, and riÅ¿e Å¿uperior to his fears.

                  <p>WHILE I attempt, with humble dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, a diÅ¿charge of the duty, and acknowledge with cordial gratitude the honor aÅ¿Å¿igned me on the preÅ¿ent occaÅ¿ion; it affords me high Å¿atisfaction, and produces correÅ¿pondent freedom, that I ariÅ¿e to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreÅ¿s a candid and enlightened audience, whoÅ¿e minds are not Å¿tained with impure adulation, nor that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due devotion paid to departed heroes, in aeras of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and Å¿uperÅ¿tition; nor hardened by that rig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>id auÅ¿terity, and envious ingratitude, that in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed age, would conÅ¿ign the characters and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of great men to oblivion.

birth; to contemplate his illuÅ¿trious life; and to condole and lament in his death. What a high aÅ¿Å¿emblage of different emotions of joy and Å¿orrow, does the remembrance of his character in this view produce in our minds? An aÅ¿Å¿emblage combining diÅ¿tant years, important events, and various achieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>On the 22<hi>d</hi> of February, 1732, our Friend, our Father, our StateÅ¿man, our Hero was bornâA day auÅ¿picious to the Columbian world! a morning on which a day-Å¿tar aroÅ¿e in America!âan aera, which neither our children, nor Å¿ucceeding generations Å¿hall ever forget, till time expires, and days Å¿hall be no more. Then was America honored! Then did Virginia, WeÅ¿tmoreland County, and WaÅ¿hington pariÅ¿h, become diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed Å¿pots of the earth.</p>
                  <p>No Å¿ooner had WASHINGTON arrived at the age of twenty years, than the happy influence of his valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble life, bedewed the frontiers of his native Å¿tate. His diÅ¿cerning and grateful country clothed him with honorable commiÅ¿Å¿ions, and veÅ¿ted him with plenary powers for a negotiation with her enemies. In diÅ¿charging the duties of theÅ¿e youthful honors, he diÅ¿armed the Å¿avage, and diÅ¿poÅ¿ed him for peace.</p>
                  <p>By his Å¿uperior penetration and proweÅ¿s, he diÅ¿tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiÅ¿hed himÅ¿elf a bleÅ¿Å¿ing to his country, triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over Indian victory, in Å¿aving the remains of Braddock's defeated army, from the wanton cruelty of a barbarous foe. TheÅ¿e early and Å¿ucceÅ¿sful exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were ominous of the future toils and dangers he endured; by which he preÅ¿erved his country from being a theatre of deÅ¿potic diverÅ¿ions for Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean tyrants, to be a garden of liberty for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican nation.</p>
                  <p>When the rights of freemen were variouÅ¿ly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringed in America; when the chains of BritiÅ¿h Å¿lavery were cunningly hid in cheÅ¿ts of tea; when a Gage, a Dunmore, with many others, Å¿tood ready to rivet the Å¿hackles, by which his country was to
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:037999_0021_100FB09FB157AEF0"/>
be violated; her chaÅ¿te cries reached his ears; he drew his Å¿word which never delighted in blood, and determined to Å¿ave her. Neither affluence of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, nor the prejudices of Britain, high in his favor for paÅ¿t Å¿ervices, could produce a Å¿ingle heÅ¿itation. He riÅ¿ks all, for love of country, of liberty, and of man. This principle drew him from his beloved and peaceful retirement. This principle induced him to renounce a life of private eaÅ¿e and honor; in which he was diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed as a Father to the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿s, the orphan's Shield, the Å¿tranger's Å¿tay and the widow's Judge; to be more eminently diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the field of Mars, for his country's general Å¿al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                  <p>At that diÅ¿treÅ¿sful period, when every moment Å¿eemed pregnant with events more important than the productions of a century; we Å¿ee WASHINGTON at the head of the American arms; elevated in Å¿ight of the world, to the performance of command, perilous as <hi>riding the whirlwind,</hi> and arduous as <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting the Å¿torms</hi> of heaven. His name carried order and government among his friends; and Å¿et bounds to the inÅ¿olence and arms of his enemies. The heights of BoÅ¿ton can tell; and their warlike entrenchments can witneÅ¿s to his Å¿uperior GeneralÅ¿hip. The abÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, the valor, the unwearied fatigues of Long-IÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, York-IÅ¿land, and the JerÅ¿eys; when WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON carried his young and inexperienced coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in his arms, with her countenance heavy, and her heart like to break, are proofs, that he, only grew brave by diÅ¿treÅ¿s, and collected Å¿trength from diÅ¿appointments. UndiÅ¿mayed by the threats of angry elements, in the Å¿torms of winter, and in the higheÅ¿t Å¿wellings of the Delaware; unappalled by the Å¿mallneÅ¿s of his numbers, with the increaÅ¿e of ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery want; and facing a powerful well equipt and vet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eran foe; he marÅ¿halled his little hoÅ¿t; he fired their Å¿ouls with love of liberty; and by a Å¿ingle effort of his high genius crumbled the overgrown pride of
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:037999_0022_100FB0A2627CE738"/>
his enemies to the duÅ¿t. By this unexpected and Å¿urpriÅ¿ing victory, he revived the deÅ¿ponding Å¿pirits of his country and invigorated her feeble arm for the field.</p>
                  <p>By his wiÅ¿dom in war, he often Å¿aved the blood of his countrymen; by retreats, triumphing over victory; converting the advances of his enemies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ambuÅ¿cades for their own deÅ¿truction; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced them, their conqueÅ¿ts and Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿es were tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary and vain.</p>
                  <p>When we contemplate our American Hero at Brandywine, Germantown, and Monmouth; how undaunted, traverÅ¿ing clouds of Å¿moke, Å¿eas of blood, and tempeÅ¿ts of fire!âHis preÅ¿ence Å¿upplying ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery wantâanimating every Å¿oulâbracing every nerveâand braving every danger. His voice in the hour of trial, was as Å¿ight to the blind, Å¿trength to the weak, courage to the fearful, and comfort to the dying.</p>
                  <p>Watched by the eagle eye of WASHINGTON, his enemies fly from City to City for reÅ¿t; and from State to State for territory, to no purpoÅ¿e. He Å¿oars aloft, alternately checks and purÅ¿ues; until the laÅ¿t exertions of his potent foe for fighting or fleeing, are exhauÅ¿ted. By a noble effort of his great abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Å¿uperior talents in command over our aux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iliaries from a nation <hi>then</hi> our ally; with the army of America, he finally forced his enemies to Å¿urren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to his clemency, as a Commander equally diÅ¿po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed to commiÅ¿erate the vanquiÅ¿hed, as to Å¿ubdue thoÅ¿e in arms; and to convince the power of Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ain of the neceÅ¿Å¿ity of turning her thoughts on peace.</p>
                  <p>TheÅ¿e, my fellowmen, are but an imperfect Å¿am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the heroic luÅ¿tre and Å¿plendid achievements, by which he directed the arms of America; until he evinced her importance, and weighed her indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence before an aÅ¿toniÅ¿hed world, in the Å¿cale of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>When the olive branch Å¿ucceeded the glitter of
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:037999_0023_100FB0A443985190"/>
arms, and the Å¿ound of induÅ¿try and agriculture, the thunders of the field of Mars; the Americans be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held WASHINGTON with delightful admiration, reÅ¿ign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his high command into the hands of his beloved country, from whom he received it; and amidÅ¿t the applauding Å¿houts of thouÅ¿ands, returning to Mount Vernon, with the prayers of Millions for bleÅ¿Å¿ings perpetual to follow him. In the exerciÅ¿e of his high command, WASHINGTON convinced the wiÅ¿e, that he was more wiÅ¿e; the brave, that he was the moÅ¿t brave; but in his reÅ¿ignation, the good, that he was the beÅ¿t. How far inferior are the Heroes of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, the convulÅ¿ed Å¿tate of her nations can witneÅ¿s.</p>
                  <p>But though WASHINGTON had retired to the peaceful Å¿hades of private life; though America is deeply in arrears of gratitude for paÅ¿t Å¿ervices; Å¿till Å¿he looks to him, as the man that muÅ¿t Å¿ecure by his counÅ¿el in the cabinet, that independence which he had gained in the field, by his Å¿word. PoÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ing every qualification to finiÅ¿h the StateÅ¿man, as well as the General, he is unanimouÅ¿ly choÅ¿en PreÅ¿ident of the Convention, which erected that noble Å¿truc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, our federal ConÅ¿titution. What Å¿agacity in reaÅ¿oning, penetration in judgment, and wiÅ¿dom in concluÅ¿ion, guided the Convention over which he preÅ¿ided, in rearing that Å¿tupendous fabric, is fully evinced by the happy effects America enjoys under its roof. To this Å¿trong hold (under God) are we indebted for preÅ¿ervation from the fury of domeÅ¿tic faction; and from the conqueÅ¿t of terror, and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, of foreign nations. It is under the covert of this all-protecting edifice, that our gaols are not thrown open by the hand of violence; that our Judges are not torn from the bench of juÅ¿tice; that our miniÅ¿ters of morality and religion are not drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from their deÅ¿ks; that places of public worÅ¿hip are not converted to play houÅ¿es, nor our precious Å¿abbaths to a French decade. It is under the banner of this Å¿tanding teÅ¿timony of WASHINGTON'S abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:037999_0024_100FB0A5EE61CB68"/>
with thoÅ¿e of his copatriots, that we are Å¿afe from the Å¿torms of endleÅ¿s revolutions, conÅ¿piracies and intrigues; and that our wiÅ¿eÅ¿t Å¿tateÅ¿men have not felt the dagger of the aÅ¿Å¿aÅ¿Å¿in, on the floor of CongreÅ¿s. It is rallying round this Å¿tandard of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional liberty, order and government, that our citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens are not robbed, our houÅ¿es not rifled, our fair not violated, our old men not miÅ¿erable; nor our tender infants deÅ¿troyed on the point of the Å¿pear. And give me leave to add, it is under the arch of this mighty building, that America Å¿its yet in her own houÅ¿e, with her children around her; and calls them happy. Happy will they Å¿till be, if they real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ize it, for it is the order of the family.</p>
                  <p>When the federal ConÅ¿titution received the Å¿anc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the people, America looks again to WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON, as the man, whom Å¿he Å¿till delights to hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or; and as worthy of her higheÅ¿t confidence in peace, as well as in war. He is unanimouÅ¿ly choÅ¿en to hold the chief reins of government. At his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try's call, atteÅ¿ted by the joy inÅ¿pired into all ranks of citizens at his election; he roÅ¿e from his Å¿eat of eaÅ¿e, on which he had been Å¿carce allowed a moment's reÅ¿t; and in the exerciÅ¿e of Å¿elf-denial for her good, bowed to her requeÅ¿t; and with a diffidence peculiar to a mind equally great in itÅ¿elf, and unÅ¿ullied by pride or diÅ¿Å¿imulation, entered on his high office, with a dignified Å¿olemnity unknown before in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica. How well he diÅ¿charged the duties of this high honor, the nations of the earth and the grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful heart of every honeÅ¿t American can witneÅ¿s.â His whole life Å¿eemed to indicate, that a Å¿pecial Prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idence had raiÅ¿ed him up, and given him a rare aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿emblage of virtues, and powers of judgment, to perform a complicated variety of important Å¿ervices; in defending his country in war; and refining and conÅ¿olidating her government in peace. Like a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus of light, in which all rays concentre; he poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whatever was noble, virtuous, and good in man.
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:037999_0025_100FB0AB35EC2360"/>
To our American Hero, as to the greateÅ¿t of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, has been, allotted the higheÅ¿t prize of human glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in running his race, without Å¿tumble, Å¿tain, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. The fame of his illuÅ¿trious deeds has explored every region of the earth, and croÅ¿Å¿ed every latitude of the ocean. On WASHINGTON, as on a blazing comet, in the firmament of human Å¿tars, the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the different Zones have had their eyes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually Å¿et; and whether friends or enemies to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, have been his equal admirers. His name Å¿hall remain in the archives of the world, till the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of time Å¿hall ceaÅ¿e; and the Å¿ublime poet, the lively limner, the curious engraver, and every artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer of monumental remembrance, will be proud to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit the moÅ¿t lively Å¿troke of taÅ¿te, and the beÅ¿t teÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of invention, to perpetuate the memory of WASHINGTON.</p>
                  <p>His Å¿word Å¿hall be the delight of the brave, and the wonder of the warrior, while arms are in uÅ¿e. And while earth is the habitation of man, the trav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eller âIndianâForeignerâor American; as he paÅ¿Å¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es Mount Vernon, will Å¿top; make a Å¿olemn pauÅ¿e! and his commemorating Å¿oliloquy Å¿hall be, There is the honored reÅ¿idence of the FATHER of his Country, the DEFENDER of her Rights, and the BENEFACTOR of man. When the good, the great, the learned, or illiterate, the Å¿oldier or citizen, look at the tomb of WASHINGTON, they will drop the generous tear on his urn, while the memory of his virtues and valor enlivens their innate reÅ¿pect for his duÅ¿t and aÅ¿hes.</p>
                  <p>But alas, he is no more! We are bereaved of WASHINGTON forever! For this, our country utters her groans of grief, and is deeply Å¿orry. For this, the chair of her Å¿tate, and the deÅ¿k of her temple are Å¿hrouded in Å¿ableâFor this, the hilt of her Å¿word, and the arm of her citizen, are clothed in crapeâ For this, her drums are muffled, her trumpets are hoarÅ¿e, and her muÅ¿ic mourns. And for this her national fortitude Å¿tands this day in arms reverÅ¿ed,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:037999_0026_100FB0AF01CB55D8"/>
not aÅ¿hamed of the tear of heavy wo on her cheek. Let us condole with her. If our hearts are not ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant; if our eyes are not flint; they will melt, they will weep for WASHINGTON. To melt is pleaÅ¿ant, to weep is manly; to forget him is ingratitude of the blackeÅ¿t hue; and to be indifferent under Å¿uch a high diÅ¿penÅ¿ation, is impious inÅ¿enÅ¿ibility.</p>
                  <p>At his birth, the pillars of tyranny trembled; in his life, kings and conquerors darkened under his Å¿uperior luÅ¿tre; and at his death, the nations mourn. If the united abilities that accompliÅ¿h the General, Patriot, and StateÅ¿man, could have baffled the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of death, WASHINGTON had never died. If the united prayers of the virtuous in America, from his Excellency ADAMS, to the loweÅ¿t citizen, could have availed, WASHINGTON were yet alive. And the moÅ¿t expreÅ¿Å¿ive tokens of reÅ¿pect, from the firÅ¿t characters in the different quarters of the world, to WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON, authorize me to Å¿ay; that if the deÅ¿ires of the good and the great, in Europe, AÅ¿ia, and Africa, added to the tears of the tawny tribes to the weÅ¿tern Ocean, could have Å¿oftened the king of terrors, our AMERICAN CHIEF were yet Å¿pared. But he is gone forever from usâwe Å¿hall hear his voice no moreâ To us, in this Å¿tupendous diÅ¿penÅ¿ation,

hid forever from our Å¿ight. Had this awful Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence taken place in America, when his arm was her Å¿upport in the field of Å¿truggle and diÅ¿treÅ¿s; and when one Å¿tumble in his walk would have made her heart tremble, and her countenance Å¿ad; who can Å¿ay, that we, with our little ones, might not Å¿it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, under the darkneÅ¿s of monarchial government, in the Å¿ackcloth of Å¿lavery. Thank Heaven, it was otherwiÅ¿e ordered; and while Å¿ubmiÅ¿Å¿ion to the high decree of his deceaÅ¿e Å¿hould humble every American in the duÅ¿t, every heart Å¿hould mingle gratitude with mourning, that heaven has Å¿pared his illuÅ¿tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous life Å¿o long.</p>
                  <p>Let us not forget the memory of our beloved WASHINGTON; and it will not ceaÅ¿e to do us good. In his life, we have a combination of examples for all claÅ¿Å¿es of citizens, from the chief Å¿eat of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to the humble peaÅ¿ant. In the firmneÅ¿s of his integrity, wiÅ¿dom of his adminiÅ¿tration, dignity of his manners, with his unremitted concern for the public good; we have a noble example for every deÅ¿cription of public officers. In the pious good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s of his heart, illuÅ¿trated by the juÅ¿tice, temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, tender benevolence, and univerÅ¿al correctneÅ¿s and purity of his manners in private life; we have all an example in WASHINGTON for living; and in his magnanimous, reÅ¿igned compoÅ¿ure in death, a precious example for dying.

                  <p>THIS great man's anceÅ¿tors came from Old England, in the year <hi>1657.</hi> He is of the third deÅ¿cent after their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration, the firÅ¿t fruit of a Å¿econd marriage; born on the <hi>22</hi>d February, <hi>1732,</hi> in the pariÅ¿h of WaÅ¿hington, WeÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moreland county, Virginia. His Father's family was numerous.âHis education was principally managed by a private Tutor, which has been often the caÅ¿e in families of diÅ¿tinction in Virginia. His Father died when he was but ten years of age.</p>
                  <p>In the fifteenth year of his age he had determined to go to Å¿ea; and had his baggage prepared for embarkation; but through the reluctance of his Å¿urviving parent to a Å¿eafaring life, he relinquiÅ¿hed his determination.</p>
                  <p>When he was in the twentieth year of his age, he was honored with a Major's commiÅ¿Å¿ion.âIn his twenty Å¿econd year, he was inveÅ¿ted with plenary powers to negociate with the French and Canadians, who were making inroads on the frontiers of the BritiÅ¿h Colonies.âHe fulfilled the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ign of his miÅ¿Å¿ion with Å¿ingular induÅ¿try, intelligence, and addreÅ¿s.âIt is Å¿aid his journals were publiÅ¿hed to the world and announced, at that early time of his life, the greatneÅ¿s of mind and correct manner of doing buÅ¿ineÅ¿s, which have Å¿ince characterized him in the management of more ardu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous undertakings.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>1755,</hi> he Å¿aved the broken remains of Braddock's defeated army, at Fort DuqueÅ¿ne.âBut innumerable, and too tedious to mention, were the hardÅ¿hips he endured, and the plans he deviÅ¿ed, to defend the frontiers during the war with France.</p>
                  <p>Peace being reÅ¿tored to the middle colonies in <hi>1758,</hi> and his health having been greatly injured by the war, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿igned his commiÅ¿Å¿ion the year following.â</p>
                  <p>After his health was gradually reÅ¿tored, he married an amiable widow of merit and wealth, with whom he has no iÅ¿Å¿ue.âHe was often choÅ¿en by the Å¿uffrages of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low citizens to fill a Å¿eat in the General AÅ¿Å¿embly of Virginia. âHe was MagiÅ¿trate in his county, and Judge of the Court.</p>

                     <pb n="31" facs="unknown:037999_0029_100FB0B3C47CC5F0"/>In <hi>1774,</hi> he was choÅ¿en a Member of the firÅ¿t American CongreÅ¿sâAnd the year following, Commander in Chief of the American Forces.âWith what conÅ¿ummate abilities he formed a body of peaÅ¿antry to a regular army, and fit to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter the flower of veteran troops, remains unparalleled in the annals of paÅ¿t ages, and will remain the admiration of the world for ages to come.</p>
                  <p>At the cloÅ¿e of the war, he reÅ¿igned his command and retired to his Å¿eat in VirginiaâMultitudes thronged his paÅ¿Å¿age, both in city and in country, hailing him as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erver of their liberties, the giver of their independence, and the reÅ¿torer of peace.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>1787,</hi> He was elected a member of the Federal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, and its PreÅ¿ident, while framing the federal ConÅ¿titution, under which we now may Å¿o happily live.â In <hi>1789,</hi> he was unanimouÅ¿ly choÅ¿en PreÅ¿ident of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited States of America, and inducted into office on the <hi>30</hi>th of April, in the City of New York in the gallery of the federal Hall in the view of thouÅ¿ands of Å¿pectators.â The oath was adminiÅ¿tered by Chancellor LivingÅ¿ton. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral circumÅ¿tances concurred to render this ceremony un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uÅ¿ually Å¿olemnâThe preÅ¿ence of the Father and Deliverer of his countryâThe impreÅ¿Å¿ion of gratitude for paÅ¿t Å¿ervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesâThe vaÅ¿t concourÅ¿e of Å¿pectatorsâThe devout and reverential manner in which he bowed, and in which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the oath; together with the conÅ¿ideration of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing choÅ¿en to the moÅ¿t dignified office in America, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in the world, by the unanimous voice of more than three Millions of enlightened freemen; all conÅ¿pired to place this among the moÅ¿t auguÅ¿t and intereÅ¿ting Å¿cenes which have ever been exhibited on the theatre of time. A Å¿pecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of this Å¿cene was Å¿o Å¿truck with the Å¿olemnity of it, as an appeal to heaven and earth at once, that when the Chancellor pronounced, <hi>LONG LIVE GEORGE WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON,</hi> his Å¿enÅ¿ibility was wound up to Å¿uch a pitch, that he could only wave his hat without being able to join one word in the repeated acclamations that rent the air.â To this office he was rechoÅ¿en until he finally declined a re-election; at which time he formed an addreÅ¿s which for

                  <p>We add; his care for his country's good is very evident in his laÅ¿t public act of condeÅ¿cenÅ¿ion in accepting the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of Lieut. General of the American army; which office he has reÅ¿igned with his life; which we are informed took place as follows. On Friday, the day before he died, he Å¿pent Å¿ome time in marking a gravel walk which he had in contemplation, on the banks of the Potowmac.âThere came a fall of Å¿now which did not deter him from his purÅ¿uit.âHe continued till his neck and hair were quite covered with Å¿now. He Å¿pent the evening with Mrs. WaÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, reading the newÅ¿papers;âwent to bed as uÅ¿ual a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout nine of the clockâwaked in the night very unwell.â In the morning finding himÅ¿elf Å¿till Å¿oâÅ¿ent for Dr. Craik of Alexandria. Soon after his arrival, two conÅ¿ulting Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿icians were Å¿ent for, but all to no purpoÅ¿e.âHis diÅ¿order would not yield to medicine; and by twelve of the clock at night on Saturday, the <hi>14</hi>th of December, <hi>1799</hi>âexpired without a groanâin the <hi>68</hi>th year of his age. He Å¿aid a few minutes before his death, "Bury me decently, and not till two days after my deceaÅ¿e."âTo Dr. Craik he Å¿aid: "I die a very hard death, but I am not afraid to die."â Before he breathed his laÅ¿t, he laid himÅ¿elf on his back, placed his hands before him, and cloÅ¿ed his own mouth and eyes.</p>
