         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THESE words were spoken in the Name of God, and by a Man of God unto <hi>Eli,</hi> who was an Honourable Person, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both the High Priest and the chief Judge in <hi>Israel,</hi> which were great Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices both in Church and State. <hi>Eli</hi> was a Descendent from <hi>Ithamar,</hi> who was <hi>Aarons</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Son. How the High-Priesthood came to be Translated from the Family of <hi>Eleazar,</hi> who was the Elder Brother, to that of <hi>Ithamar,</hi> the Scripture no where informs us. It is probably conjectured, that the High Priests of <hi>Eleazars</hi> Family, had by some hainous crimes in the Dayes of the Judges, provoked God to lay

them aside for several Generations. When <hi>Eli</hi> was advanced to this Dignity, the Lord promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to continue that Honour to him, and to his Posterity; but this Promise must be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood as conditional, <abbr>

            <p>The <hi>Doctrinal Truth</hi> which may be insisted on from the words, as sutable to the present Occasion, and to the <hi>Honourable Assembly</hi> in this House Convened before the Lord, is,
<hi>That to Honour God is the surest and the only way to obtain Honour from Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We shall only Enquire into two particulars, in order to the clearing of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> before us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>What are the Characters of one that does Honour God;</hi> whereby we may judge whether we are such or no?</p>
            <p n="2">2.<hi>What Honour it is that God will surely confer on such persons?</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:000880_0011_0FAC963FEF60FB88"/>Quest. 1. <hi>What are the Characters of one that does Honour God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Answ. 1. <hi>He is one that does yield Universal Obedience to the Commandments of God.</hi> They <hi>that Honour me</hi> (saith the Lord, h. e. they that obe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> me. When in the Fifth Commandment, Children are required to Honour their Parents, this is a special thing intended, that they should obey all their lawful Commands. The Lord said to the Jews, <hi>If I am a Father, where is my Honour?</hi> Mal. 1. 6. <hi>i. e.</hi> the Obedience which is due unto me Kings are Honoured when their Laws are duly observed; so is the God and King Eternal, when his Laws are complied with. There is an Internal Obedience. For we are required to love, and Fear, and Delight, and Trust in God. And there is an External Obedience: When a mans words and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward actions are as to the matter of them such as the Divine Law Enjoyns. There may be something of an External Obedience where that which is Internal is wanting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mat. 15. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. <hi>This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.</hi> Whereas if a mans heart is set upon honouring God, that Internal Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience will discover it self in an Universal Conformity to the Law of God in outward acts of Obedience thereunto. The Commands of God may not any of them be disputed, but 
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:000880_0012_0FAC9640C2FFB340"/>
obeyed without any Reserve or Limitation. Suppose the Commandment to be never so difficult, &amp; never so contrary unto a mans own will and desires, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> he knows that God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands it, and has in him an heart that honours God, he will do the Commandment. When God Commanded <hi>Abraham</hi> to Sacrifice his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Son, he Rose early to do it. Gen. 22. 3. And by that high act of Obedience did greatly honour God: And so did <hi>Joshua.</hi> The Lord said to him, <hi>Have not I Commanded thee?</hi> Josh. 1. 9. And then he did as commanded though to the hazard of his li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e. This Honour of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Obedience is due to God alone. Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours are to obey their Superiours, but with this Reserve alway<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

than them. Thus the Holy Apostles, when the Jewish Rulers straitly commanded them that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

A King is honoured when his Subjects humbly kneel before him with their petitions; so is the King of Heaven. When we praise him then we honour him. God says, <hi>Whoso offereth praise glorifyeth me.</hi> Psal. 50. 23. when we give him Thanks, we give him glory. <hi>The Thanksgiving of many redounds to the Glory of God.</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 15. when we do with prepared hearts receive the Sacraments which are of Divine Appointment, we honour

the Author and Institutor of them. When we Sanctine the Lords Day, we honour him whose day it is. <hi>Isa.</hi> 58 13. <hi>If thou call the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honourable, and shalt honour him.</hi> The man that honours God, has this Character belonging to him, he is constant in Prayer, consciencious in observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Divine Institutions, and one that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members the Sabbath Day to heep it Holy. Now that which we make an Object of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Worship, we put the highest honour upon that possibly can be. We own that which we Worship, to be the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ief good, the first cause, and the last end of all. And therefore it is that God only may be Worshipped. Mat. 4. 10 <hi>Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve:</hi> It is the highest dishonour to God that can be, to yield Religious Adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to any other Object besides Himself: For it is to make other things to be as good as He with whom none may be compared. Nor may we worship him in any other way, or by any other means then what Himself has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. To do so would be a great reflection on the Wisdom and Honour of the Glorious God; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="9" facs="unknown:000880_0015_0FAC9642E97D3740"/>
they would worship the God which brought them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but by an Image of their own devising, whereby they incurred his high displeasure. The <hi>Jewish Doctors</hi> say, that <hi>God never visited their Nation with any Judgments; but he put in one Ounce of Vengeance for that Sin of their making the Calf in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness.</hi> This also was <hi>Jeroboa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Nor do we honour God as we should do except we are duly careful as to the manner of Worship, that it be according to the will of God. Christ said, <hi>Take heed how you hear.</hi> Luk.8. 18. so we must take heed how we pray, and take heed how we come to Sacraments. God is a Spirit, and will be worshipped after a spiritual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. <hi>He seeketh such to worship him.</hi> Joh. 4. 23. because He is honoured by a Spiritual Worship, and by them who worship Him after a spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al manner. Men may as to the matter of Worship, and as to the means of Worship, do as the Law requireth, and yet displease and dishonour God by being careless as to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Worship. In <hi>Davids</hi> Time the Levites sought the Lord, nevertheless He made a breach upon them, <hi>for that they sought him not after the due order.</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 13.

they were not cleansed as they that came into the Sanctuary ought to have been: for which cause many of the people fell under the Holy displeasure of God. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3018, 19, 20. So the <hi>Corinthians</hi> because they approached to the Table of the Lord after an unprepared manner, were visited with a disease that proved mortal to some of them. They by such an unworthy manner of worship dishonoured God, and God lightly esteemed of them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The Honourer of God is one that ha's an Holy Zeal for His Name.</hi> A man that honours ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ha's a Zeal for him. He cannot bear it that the person whom he has an high value for should be abused. So he that honours God is greatly concerned at the injuries which are done to his Name. Psal. 69. 9. <hi>The reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.</hi> He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Glory. Now his Holy Heart was always burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Zeal for God. Therefore was it said of him, <hi>The Zeal of thy House has eaten me up.</hi> Joh. 2. 17. This Zeal which is the Character of one that honours God, discovers it self in two things especially.</p>

So did Christ shew his Zeal in punishing them that had profaned the Temple. When <hi>Phineas</hi> Executed Judgment on several filthy debauched persons, God was honoured and highly pleased with that his Zeal.

               </hi> in causing the Priests of <hi>Baal</hi> to be slain. <hi>Elis</hi> sin for which the Lord did so severely threaten and punish him and his family was his want of Zeal. He is charged with honouring his Sons above God. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 29. For if he had punished them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their deser<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Indeed he reproved them, but notwithstanding they were his Sons, considering he was the Judge of the Land, he ought to have put them to death, because they were guilty of Crimes which the Law of God had made Capital.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Zeal discovers it self in promoving those things whereby God is Honoured,</hi> as well as in suppressing those things whereby He is dishonoured. If we promote the Establishment of the worship of God in the purity of it, we honour His Name. <hi>Hezekiah, Josiah,</hi> and other Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Kings of Judah, manifested their Zeal not only in destroying Idolatry, but in settling the true worship of God according to his written word. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> that Excellent Governour of the Province of Judea, honoured God by the good deeds which he did for his House and for the Offices thereof. <hi>Neh.</hi> 13. 14.

            <p n="4">4. <hi>Another Character of one that honours God, is that he does Reverence the Image of God wherever he seeth it.</hi> Now the Image of God is seen in two things especially.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In that Authority and Dominion which he giveth to some over others. On this account man is said to be <hi>the Image and Glory of God.</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 7.

Wherefore he that honours God will be afraid to speak evil of dignities, or to despise dominion, but he will make Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to give honour to whom honour is due. That man who makes no Conscience of the fifth Commandment which requireth subjection unto Lawful Authority, does not honour but despise that God whose Image is seen in that Authority.

Indeed, if a man will be Zealous for God, and faithful to his interest, there are wicked men that will reproach and revile him. <hi>David</hi> found it so. <hi>They that sat in the gate;</hi> some that had been in power, <hi>spake against him,</hi> and <hi>he was the song of the Drunkards.</hi> Psal. 69. 12.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>landered by such vile persons. Matth. 5. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Who honoured God more than the Prophets and Apostles in their day? And who were ever more reviled? So the chief Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers in the last Century. <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> especially, no men were reproached more than they that had deserved better usage from the age wherein they lived. It is not a desirable thing for a man to be Cryed up by the generality of wicked men. Luk. 6. 26. <hi>We unto you when all men shall speak well of you: for so their Fathers did by the false Prophets.</hi> All the profane men in the Land would be ready to speak well of the false Prophets, because they would daub their Consciences with untempered Mortar. They

would say though you live in your sins, as long as you are called by the Name of the true God, and go to the Temple, and say your Prayers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you shall go to Heaven. There is no need of any such Repentance as the true Prophets say is necessary for your Salvation. Just as some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly Preachers in these dayes say, if men call themselves Christians and are Baptised, there is no need of preaching Conversion to them. It is a sign that a man ha's not been so faithful to Gods Interest as he should have been, when the wickedest of men extol him. One having heard that a very vicious person commended him, was troubled at it, Alas (said he) <hi>quid ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> feci,</hi> what have I done amiss that so wicked a man should speak so well of me. So then a Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion amongst such is no honour, nor desireable: but to have the love and respect of good men is desireable: therefore David prayed for that. Psal. 119. 79. <hi>Let those that fear thee, Turn unto me.</hi> And God did give him an Interest in their hearts. Verse 74. <hi>They that fear thee will be glad when they see me.</hi> Good men if they did but see David, they were glad: their hearts rejoyced to see that there was such a man yet living in the world. And this honour had the Governours in Israel who had generously ventured them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the cause of God and of his people. Wherefore the inspired <hi>Deborah</hi> said of them. Judg. 5. 9. <hi>My heart is toward the Governours of Israel. 
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:000880_0032_0FAC96566911DEC8"/>
h. e.</hi> I do in my heart love and honour them. And doubtless all the good people in the Land did so. And thus it was with <hi>Mordecai,</hi> out of respect to the Honour of God, he would not bow the knee to <hi>Haman. Haman</hi> was a Type of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and no question aspired af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, &amp; expected a Religious Worship as <hi>Antichrist</hi> does, which <hi>Mordecai</hi> would not yield unto him: Now God did not only advance <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai</hi> to a very honourable Station, he was next to the King <hi>Ahasuerus,</hi> but also gave him a great Reputation amongst his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

You that will be false to your God, will never be faithful unto me, and therefore he banished them his Court.
