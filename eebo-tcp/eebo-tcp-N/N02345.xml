            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Remarkable RELATION OF A <hi>Cockatrice</hi> cruſh'd in the Egg.</head>
            <p>A Veſſel of that ſort which they call, a <hi>Snoe,</hi> belonging to certain Merchants in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and commanded by <hi>John Green,</hi> of that City, ſailed from <hi>Jamaica,</hi> ſome time in <hi>April,</hi> 1726. bound for <hi>Guinea.</hi> The Boat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwain, <hi>William Fly,</hi> having before concerted with ſome aboard, (in a way of Revenge, they ſaid, for <hi>Bad Uſage</hi>) the Deſtruction of the <hi>Maſter</hi> and the <hi>Mate,</hi> and the proper <hi>Conſequences,</hi> on May 27. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout One a Clock in the Morning, he, with one <hi>Alexander Mitchel,</hi> went into the Cabin, and ſiezing on the Maſter, held his Hands, while <hi>Mitchel</hi> wounded him. Then they hawled him up; who perceiving their Intention to throw him overboard, beg'd, <hi>For the Lord's ſake, don't throw me overboard; For if you do, you throw me into Hell immediately.</hi> But <hi>Fly</hi> bid him ſay, <hi>Lord, Have Mercy on my Soul</hi>! And when he ſiezed the Mainſheets with his Hand, to prolong his Time, the mercileſs Monſters, with a Cooper's Broad-axe, cut off his Hand, and threw him over-board. While this was a doing, one <hi>Samuel Cole,</hi> preſently aſſiſted with <hi>Mitchel</hi> and one <hi>Winthrop,</hi> ſecured the Mate, whoſe Name was
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002779_0004_0FE5F5906AFF4B30"/>
               <hi>Thomas Jenkins,</hi> and brought him upon Deck, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him, <hi>that he ſhould go after the Maſter.</hi> Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, having firſt cut him down the Shoulder with a Broad-axe, they threw him over, juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Main Shrouds. After he was thrown o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, he cried out unto the Doctor, <hi>For the Lord's ſake, to fling him a Rope.</hi> But <hi>Fly</hi> ſoon ſecured the Doctor, and put him in Irons; and confined the Gunner alſo and the Carpenter, who were not for their Turn.</p>
            <p>Two Days after this, they met one of the Ships, that came out in Company with <hi>Green,</hi> and hailing them, ask'd, How Captain <hi>Green</hi> did. They an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>Very well! At your Service</hi>! But upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting, whether they had beſt attack that Ship, they left her, in Conſideration, That they had not Hands enough to Man her. So, they bore away for <hi>North-Carolina</hi>; Where, off Cape <hi>Hattaras</hi> Bar, on June 3. there lay a Sloop at Anchor, whereof the Commander was one whoſe Name is <hi>Fulker.</hi> Some of the Sloop's Hands went aboard <hi>Fly,</hi> who was now become the Captain of the <hi>Snoe,</hi> ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them to want a Pilot. <hi>Fly</hi> commanded <hi>Fulker</hi> aboard, and informed him, <hi>They were Gentlemen of Fortune</hi>; and let him know, that they muſt have the <hi>Sloop,</hi> if it ſailed better than the <hi>Snoe.</hi> The contrary Winds rendring the <hi>Sloop</hi> unable to be brought off, our New Captain fell into a great Paſſion, and ſwore he would burn her, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Fulker</hi> to the Geers, (who it ſeems, unadviſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provoked them) inflicted a ſevere Scourging upon him. The Boats Crue, could not bring the <hi>Sloop</hi> any further than the Bar, but there ſhe bilg'd and ſank: and the Pirates endeavoured then to ſet
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002779_0005_0FE5F5BCA8E6DEF8"/>
her on Fire, but could not make the Fire to take. <hi>Fulker</hi> and his Men, and his Paſſengers, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Priſoners by <hi>Fly</hi>; But on June 5. they ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from thence; and on the Day following they ſaw a Ship commanded by one whoſe Name is <hi>Gale,</hi> bound from <hi>Barbados</hi> to <hi>Virginia.</hi> They could not come up with <hi>Gale</hi> till the next Morning; when they hoiſted their <hi>Black Flag,</hi> and fired ſeveral Guns at the Ship; and there being little Wind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Gale</hi> ſtruck; and <hi>Fly</hi> made the Men his Priſoners; but robbed the Ship only of ſeveral Sails, and ſome Cloaths and ſmall Arms; and after a Captivity of Two Days releaſed them; at the ſame time giving <hi>Fulker,</hi> and one of his Paſſengers, and a Servant, and <hi>Green</hi>'s Doctor, their Liberty. However they forceably detained one <hi>William Atkinſon,</hi> who had been Commander of a Brigantine, but left her for a Paſſage home in <hi>Fulker,</hi> bound then for <hi>Boſton</hi>: And who had often declared, That if the <hi>Pirates</hi> ever took him, he would humour them, till he could ſee his firſt Opportunity to riſe upon them. They wanted him to be their <hi>Pilot,</hi> for the Coaſt of <hi>New-England</hi>; which they told him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he ſhould be, or, <hi>They would blow his Brains out.</hi> It ſeems, they forgot, how bad a Coaſt <hi>New-England</hi> has been for <hi>Pirates</hi> to come upon! Off of <hi>Delaware Bay,</hi> they met a Sloop commanded by one <hi>Harris</hi> bound from <hi>New-York</hi> to <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> having about Fifty Scotch-Iriſh Paſſengers aboard; which upon their hoiſting of their <hi>Black Flag</hi> Surrendred unto them. After they had a little ranſack'd the Veſſel, and kept her twenty four Hours, they forced a Luſty Blade, one <hi>James Benbrook,</hi> from her, and ſo diſmiſs'd her. <hi>Fly</hi> bore away for <hi>Martha's Vineyard,</hi> pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002779_0006_0FE5F5BFB3E82D70"/>
to Water there, and ſo away for <hi>Guinea</hi>; But the <hi>Pilot</hi> purpoſely miſs'd the port, (whereat <hi>Fly</hi> was very angry,) and on June 23. bearing Eaſtward, they mett with a <hi>Fiſhing Schooner,</hi> on <hi>Browns</hi> Bank; from which upon <hi>Fly</hi>'s hoiſting his <hi>Black Flag,</hi> and threatning to ſink her, the Maſter came aboard them, &amp; <hi>Fly</hi> told him, he muſt have the <hi>Schooner,</hi> unleſs he could inform him, where to get a better Sailor. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Noon, they ſaw ſome other <hi>Schooners</hi>; and <hi>Fly</hi> ſent that <hi>Schooner</hi> with ſeven hands after them. <hi>Fly</hi> (who had now entirely ſold himſelf to the God of <hi>Ekron,</hi>) and Three other Pirates, whereof one (<hi>Samuel Cole</hi> aforeſaid, was in Irons upon Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of Mutiny, remained aboard the <hi>Snoe</hi>; and fifteen others that had been taken by him; namely, <hi>Fulkers</hi> Mate, a couple of his Boys, <hi>Green</hi>'s Gunner and Carpenter, five of <hi>Gale</hi>'s Men, <hi>Benbrook,</hi> Three Fiſhermen belonging to the <hi>Schooner,</hi> and our <hi>Atkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> While the <hi>Pirates</hi> were gone upon their chaſe, there appeared in Sight ſeveral other Fiſhing-Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels; and <hi>Atkinſon</hi> by telling <hi>Fly</hi> what he ſaw, drew him forward, from his two Loaden <hi>Guns,</hi> and <hi>Sword,</hi> which he had with him; and while <hi>Fly</hi> ſatt on the <hi>Windlace</hi> with his Proſpective-Glaſs, <hi>Benbrook</hi> and <hi>Walker,</hi> (who had been <hi>Fulker</hi>'s Mate) upon the Direction from <hi>Atkinſon,</hi> ſecured <hi>Fly,</hi> and put him in Irons; and <hi>Atkinſon</hi> ſtruck another of the <hi>Pirates</hi>; and with the Help of the Carpenter, ſoon confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the other Two.

               <p>The poor men, whom you murdered, You <hi>hurried</hi> out of the world; You allow'd <hi>them</hi> no <hi>ſpace to Repent.</hi> They begg'd at leaſt for a <hi>little Time</hi> if you would not be diſſwaded from Killing them;—that you would not immediately bring on them the <hi>Death,</hi> which with a prodigious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, they told you, they were <hi>unprepared</hi> for.

Murderers,</hi> may enter there. — Our SAVIOUR is become our <hi>Surety.</hi> He had a moſt <hi>Holy Heart</hi>; He led a moſt <hi>Holy Life</hi>; He yielded a moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience to the <hi>Law</hi> of GOD. No <hi>Fault</hi> could ever be found in Him. This was to produce a <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> for His People, Renouncing all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on their own, to plead for their Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with GOD. It was <hi>He</hi> that <hi>made</hi> the <hi>Law.</hi> It was for <hi>our ſake</hi> that He put Himſelf under it. You never can make yourſelves a <hi>Righteouſneſs.

               <p>Well; But if the <hi>Offering</hi> of your SAVIOUR, do avail for you, there will be produced a <hi>New Heart</hi> in you; Your <hi>Heart</hi> will now cloſe with GOD; and you will make the <hi>Service</hi> of GOD, the the <hi>Chief End</hi> and <hi>Main Work</hi> of your Life. And
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002779_0016_0FE5F5F1F50DECA8"/>
GOD will be to you, what you have heretofore vainly ſought in <hi>Creatures.</hi> The <hi>Love</hi> of GOD will be <hi>Rooted</hi> in your Souls; and all the <hi>Branches</hi> of PI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ETY will be found growing upon it. You will ſay, <hi>What have I any more to do with Idols?</hi> You will not <hi>Sin,</hi> to pleaſe the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> or the <hi>World,</hi> or the <hi>Devil.</hi> You will <hi>have Reſpect unto all the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of GOD.</hi> This <hi>Wiſdom</hi> you <hi>lack</hi>; Alas, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute have you been of it, all your Days! But, the Direction is, <hi>If any Man lack Wiſdom, let him ask it of GOD</hi>! Send up then, Oh! ſend up a Cry that ſhall pierce the Heavens; <hi>Lord, Beſtow a New Heart upon me!</hi> You muſt always remember, <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Holineſs no Man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> You cannot be Received into the <hi>Heavenly World,</hi> if you have not firſt an <hi>Heavenly Heart.

               </p>
               <p>Thus, I have in a <hi>few words</hi> given you the <hi>Sum of the Matter</hi>; which I hope, you will <hi>Think o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> when I am departed from you. For <hi>one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,</hi> thus much may be Enough, if you will try when I am withdrawn, to <hi>go over</hi> the <hi>Way of Life</hi> that has been ſet before you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> will at this Time add only this <hi>One Remark.</hi> If you come to the <hi>Repentance</hi> that is unto <hi>Salvation,</hi> it
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002779_0017_0FE5F5F306239820"/>
will appear, in <hi>Diſpoſitions,</hi> that will be the Reverſe of Thoſe, which have puſh'd you on, to the <hi>Sins Repented</hi> of. I'l Illuſtrate it, with Two Inſtances.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That which puſh'd you on to Robberies and Piracies, was an Immoderate, Inordinate, Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular Deſire of <hi>Worldly Poſſeſſions.</hi> Now, if you <hi>Repent,</hi> you will have a Diſpoſition patiently to bear any <hi>Wants</hi> and <hi>Straits,</hi> that GOD may order for you; and rather ſuffer any <hi>Poverty</hi> and all ſorts of <hi>Difficulties,</hi> than Sin, or do any Unlawful Thing, to gain the World. In this point how do you find yourſelves diſpoſed?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Secondly, That which has puſh'd you on to <hi>Murders,</hi> as well as <hi>Robberies</hi> and <hi>Piracies,</hi> was an <hi>Hatred</hi> of your <hi>Brother,</hi> 'Tis what you have carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on to the laſt Extremity, A moſt <hi>Finiſhed Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred</hi>; Now if you Repent, you will have a Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition full of <hi>Benignity; Good will towards Men,</hi> will ſweeten your Minds; You will have an Hearty <hi>Love</hi> to your Neighbour. You will <hi>Wiſh well</hi> to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one, whoſe <hi>Welfare,</hi> is Conſiſtent with the public Safety.</p>
               <p>Now, ſhall I Enquire after this point alſo; How you find yourſelves diſpoſed in it? Say— <hi>Fly</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, Do you ſay; Are there any in the world, which you don't wiſh well to.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>Fly. <hi>Yes; There is one Man, that I don't, and I can't wiſh well to! It is a Vain Thing to ly, If I ſhould ſay, that I forgive that Man, and that I wiſh him well,

               <p>Alas, Man, Thou doſt <hi>add Sin to Sin.</hi> To bear <hi>Malice</hi> againſt your Neighbour, or be unable <hi>wiſh him well,</hi> tho' it be not a <hi>Lye,</hi> yet it is as great a <hi>Sin</hi> as a <hi>Lye.</hi> But you muſt part with <hi>all Sin,</hi> if you would find the <hi>Mercy</hi> and have the <hi>Comfort</hi> of a <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent.</hi> The Great GOD has over and over again required you to <hi>put away all Malice,</hi> and <hi>lay aſide all Malice.</hi> Yea, the SON of GOD, the <hi>True witneſs, who delivereth Souls,</hi> has expreſly told you, <hi>That if you do not Forgive, you ſhall not be forgiven.</hi> I hope, the <hi>Lords-Prayer</hi> is not forgotten with you.

               <p>Fly. <hi>Yes, I do! —But for all that, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Forgive that Man. GOD Almighty Revenge me on him! — 'Tis a Vain thing — I won't dy with a Lye in my mouth,</hi>

               <p>ACcording to your Deſire, which I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ready unto the beſt of my power to Gratify, I have uſed my humble Interceſſions, with His Honour the Lieu. Governour, to grant you a Reprieve of Two or Three Days, that you may have Time to make more Thorough Work, in the <hi>Proceſs of Repentance</hi> which is, <hi>The one Thing that is Needful for you.</hi> He is a Perſon every where known to be of an <hi>Excellent Spirit,</hi> and as he is one of unſpotted <hi>Equity,</hi> ſo he is one of uncommon <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency.</hi> It afflicts him, that he cannot grant you ſuch a <hi>Small Releef,</hi> but, as the <hi>Special Court</hi> by which the <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Place</hi> of your <hi>Death,</hi> were A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, Voted, and accordingly Regiſtred, is now diſſolved, he apprehends it improper for him <hi>now,</hi> to alter any thing about it.</p>
               <p>But in <hi>this very Thing,</hi> you may now ſee the Hand of an Holy and a Righteous GOD, obliging you in ſome Degree to ſay, <hi>As I have done ſo GOD has Requited me</hi>!

               <p>Miſerable Man, You know the Word of GOD, <hi>That no Murderer has Eternal Life.</hi> And <hi>Murders</hi> cannot be <hi>pardoned,</hi> if they be not Confeſſed, Bewailed, and Repented of.</p>
               <p>We can do no more, but with <hi>Tears</hi> [which, alas, you have not for yourſelf!] Lament the unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and unparallel'd <hi>Obduration</hi> that you are given up unto; and Beſeech you to <hi>Conſider your ways</hi>; and ſend up our Cries unto the GOD of all Grace, to beſtow a <hi>New,</hi> and a <hi>Right,</hi> and a <hi>Soft Heart</hi> upon you.</p>
               <p>I have done with you, any further than to ask your Attention unto the brief <hi>Inſtructions,</hi> which your <hi>Three Brethren</hi> here are now expecting of me.</p>
               <p>Poor <hi>Sons of Death</hi>; Be attentive to the <hi>Words of Life</hi>; and Hearken as for Eternity.</p>
               <p>You are in moſt affecting Circumſtances. If you Dy two or three Days hence, in ill Terms with Heaven, you will be doom'd and thrown into Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, inconceivably more grievous, than any things which you ever have in this World been vexed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. Your <hi>Spirits</hi> will be continually tortured with the furious and rending Scourges of a <hi>Guilty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</hi> An Infinite GOD will arm your <hi>Conſcience</hi>

to make direful Reflections on your paſt Miſbeha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours. You will fall into the Hands of <hi>Devils</hi>; you may gueſs a little, how <hi>they</hi> will handle you, by <hi>your</hi> way of handling one another. Your Filthy <hi>Bodies</hi> will after a long period be <hi>Raiſed,</hi> that in them you may <hi>receive according to what you have done in Them.</hi> How tremendous <hi>pains,</hi> will be then inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on you! Yea, The <hi>Lord GOD Omnipotent</hi> will not only Baniſh you from all comfortable Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but with more immediate Impreſſions of His Wrath, make you the Everlaſting Triumphs of His Vengeance, and ſhoot intolerable Coruſcations of it into your Enlarged Minds, and keep all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of a Tormenting Fire upon them. Verily, He will <hi>Puniſh</hi> like a GOD; And you will find a <hi>Strange Puniſhment reſerved for the workers of Iniquity.</hi> Can you hear this, and not cry out; <hi>O Lord, My Fleſh trembles for fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy Judgments</hi>!</p>
               <p>But then, if before you <hi>Dy,</hi> you do in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of a <hi>Repenting Faith</hi> get your <hi>Pardon Sealed,</hi> and your Souls taken into the Saving and Healing Hands of that <hi>Good One,</hi> whoſe Call now unto you, is, <hi>Look unto me, and be Saved:</hi> Your Expired <hi>Spirits,</hi> will be taken into the <hi>Paradiſe</hi> of GOD. And the REDEEMER will anon <hi>Raiſe</hi> you from the <hi>Dead,</hi> and make you partakers of the <hi>Spiritual Bleſſings in the Heavenly places.</hi> Tho' you have been the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions of <hi>Robbers,</hi> you ſhall then be the Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Angels</hi>; yea, you ſhall <hi>Inherit all things,</hi> and be <hi>Filled with all the Fulneſs of GOD.</hi> The Things to be done for you, are beyond what the <hi>Heart of Man can conceive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You are not ſtrangers to what we read of a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſeh,</hi>

               <p>One Thing Engaged by our Lord-REDEE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MER, is, To offer up a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> unto <hi>Divine Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice</hi> to make Atonement for them; and undergo the ſad Things which are due to them for their Sins, that ſo they may be delivered from them.

work out, and bring in a <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> that ſhall be Reckoned Their's; for <hi>them</hi> to be dealt withal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to it. This is already done; Is it not?</p>
               <p>Now, Do you <hi>Conſent,</hi> unto This; To be <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given</hi> of GOD, on the account of the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> your SAVIOUR has preſented for you?</p>
               <p>Do you <hi>Conſent</hi> unto This; To be <hi>Accepted</hi> with GOD, on the account of the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> with which your SAVIOUR does furniſh you? And, You have no other <hi>Hope!</hi> — no other <hi>Plea</hi>!</p>
               <p>Well; But another Thing Engaged by our Lord-REDEEMER is, To make ſuitable Impreſſions on the <hi>Souls</hi> of His Choſen; To fill them with the <hi>Love</hi> of GOD and their Neighbour; To <hi>Heal</hi> all that is amiſs in them; To <hi>Quicken</hi> them for Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to GOD; And <hi>work</hi> in them what is <hi>well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in the ſight of GOD</hi>; and Conform them to His <hi>Will</hi> in every thing; and render all <hi>Sin</hi> Odious to them; and incline them to every thing that is <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>Juſt</hi> and <hi>Good</hi>; and fit them for, and bring them to, the <hi>Heavenly world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For <hi>you,</hi> This remains to be done. Do you <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,</hi> That He'l do all this for you, and in you?—</p>

               <p>Inſtead of ſaying, <hi>I will Fear GOD and Serve Him,</hi> do you ſay, <hi>O my SAVIOUR, I deſire, that by Thee Living in me, I may Fear GOD, and Serve Him</hi>!</p>

            <p>A <hi>Compariſon</hi> is inſtituted between <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Men</hi>; to prove, That if <hi>Angels</hi> muſt abaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before GOD, and lay aſide all boaſting pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions to <hi>perfection,</hi> much more muſt Men do ſo.

In ſome Senſe he did ſo <hi>Dy.</hi> The <hi>Wiſeſt</hi> Man in any Court or Colledge upon Earth, is as liable to <hi>Death</hi> as the pooreſt Creature that comes within the ſtatute of <hi>Idiocy.</hi> We read, Heb. 9.27. — <hi>'Tis appointed for Men once to Dy.</hi> The <hi>Common Law</hi> of <hi>Death</hi> is what every Man, muſt ſubmit unto. The <hi>Law</hi> runs, <hi>All Titles, Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:002779_0033_0FE5F648531D72A8"/>
Preferments, Excellencies &amp;c. to the Contrary, in any wiſe notwithſtanding.</hi> 'Tis the <hi>Common Lot</hi> of Mankind; of wiſe <hi>Men,</hi> as well as others. They muſt be none but Egregious <hi>Fools,</hi> who can dream of any Exemption from this <hi>common Lot.</hi> Ah, <hi>Foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Wretch, and far gone in <hi>Folly; ſhall the Earth be forſaken for thee</hi>; or ſhalt thou be permitted never to <hi>forſake the Earth</hi>! And ſhall a Decree more Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed than a <hi>Rock,</hi> be <hi>removed of its place,</hi> that thou mayſt always continue in <hi>thy place</hi>? No, we have the Summ of the Matter, and the Root of it. Rom. 5.12; <hi>Wherefore, as by one Man Sin entred into the World, and Death by Sin; and ſo Death paſſed upon all Men, for that all have ſinned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt. No <hi>Natural Wiſdom</hi> will ſecure, or excuſe any Man from <hi>dying</hi> like all other Men. We read, 1 King. 11.43. <hi>Solomon ſlept with his Fathers.</hi> Where is the <hi>Politician,</hi> that can <hi>Out-wit</hi> his <hi>Laſt Enemy,</hi> or by his <hi>Wit</hi> elude the Approaches of that <hi>Enemy?</hi> What <hi>Lawyer</hi> ſo Cunning as to <hi>Quaſh</hi> the <hi>Writ of Death? Academies</hi> are emptied of their Inhabitants, as well as <hi>Hoſpitals.</hi> There is one honourable Tribe of Men, whoſe Profeſſion 'tis to <hi>prolong Life.</hi> But the <hi>Phyſicians</hi> cannot inſtruct us how always to <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogue Death. None of them can by any means redeem his Brother,</hi> or find out an <hi>Elixir</hi> by which his Patient may <hi>Live for ever, and not ſee Corruption.</hi> They ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times put by a <hi>Paſs,</hi> which <hi>Death</hi> is making at us; but let them <hi>Fence</hi> never ſo Skilfully, anon <hi>Death</hi> gives a <hi>Home Thruſt,</hi> and the Diſtreſt <hi>Phyſicians</hi> look on with troubled and grieved Eyes, and own, <hi>We are now Phyſicians of no Value.</hi> They <hi>dye themſelves</hi> likewiſe; and none ſooner, than they that like <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> brag of their <hi>Immortalizing Medicines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:002779_0034_0FE5F6498019D160"/>Secondly. No, nor will <hi>Religious Wiſdom</hi> neither. We read, Joſh. 1.2. <hi>Moſes my Servant is Dead.</hi> They that are <hi>wiſe unto Salvation,</hi> yet will not by that <hi>Wiſdom Save</hi> themſelves from <hi>Temporal Death. Piety</hi> will deliver from the <hi>Sting</hi> of <hi>Death</hi>; but not from <hi>Death</hi> it ſelf. <hi>Piety</hi> will deliver from the <hi>ſecond Death</hi>; but not from the <hi>Firſt Death. Piety</hi> will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a <hi>Reſurrection</hi> for us, that will bring us out of the <hi>Grave</hi>; it will not obtain a <hi>Preſervation</hi> for us, that we ſhall not go into the <hi>Grave. What Man is he that liveth,</hi> let him live never ſo piouſly, never ſo prayerfully, never ſo Fruitfully, who <hi>ſhall not ſee Death, or deliver his Soul from the hand of the Grave?</hi> In fine, It was a Sentence in the Wiſdom of the Ancients; <hi>Is Vir non eſt, qui lapides atque edificia cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruere, et homines mori miratur.</hi> The Man that won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to ſee <hi>Buildings fall,</hi> and <hi>People dy,</hi> is not worthy the Name of a <hi>Man.</hi> I remember <hi>Poſidonius</hi> in the Life of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> tells us, how much that Great Man was affected with that Sentence, a little before his own going out of the World. May we <hi>all,</hi> ſince we are all going out of the world, accuſtom our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to this Heart affecting <hi>Meditation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. The ſecond Thing before us, is, A much <hi>worſe unhpppineſs</hi> that befalls the <hi>moſt of men,</hi> and the <hi>worſt unhappineſs</hi> that any Man can have befalling of him. The moſt of Men, <hi>dy</hi> before they have arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved unto the only true <hi>Wiſdom.</hi> Few Men are <hi>wiſe</hi> before they <hi>Dy.</hi> Thus this clauſe is well carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Expoſitors; <hi>Prius moriuntur quam quicquam intellexerunt de Divina Sapientia.</hi> They <hi>Dy</hi> before they know what <hi>Wiſdom</hi> is: They <hi>dy</hi> ſtrangers, to Divine, Real, Saving <hi>Wiſdom.</hi> All Men are, <hi>born
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:002779_0035_0FE5F64A50D599D0"/>
Fools.</hi> We read, Job 11.12. <hi>Born like the wild-Aſſes Colt.</hi> And the moſt of Men <hi>Dy Fools.</hi> The <hi>lives</hi> of Men are generally ſpent in <hi>Folly.</hi> And they <hi>dy</hi> before the cure of their <hi>Folly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We will Enquire; Firſt, <hi>Whence it proceeds,</hi> that the moſt of Men, <hi>dy</hi> before they arrive unto <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom?</hi> You may be ſure, The <hi>Fall of Man</hi> is the cauſe of this evil. Man was ambitious of <hi>Wiſdom.</hi> The Temptation of the <hi>Forbidden Fruit</hi> was, <hi>A Tree to be deſired, to make one wiſe.</hi> But Man by his <hi>Fall</hi> has loſt his <hi>Wiſdom.</hi> A <hi>Darkneſs</hi> is come upon his Mind. His perverſe Mind is now naturally diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto <hi>Error.</hi> He is naturally <hi>Ignorant, and out of the way.</hi> His Faculties, to diſcern <hi>wiſely</hi> what is <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Good,</hi> are horribly wounded by his <hi>Fall</hi> from God. It is now come to paſs, that the Children of Men come under that Character; Rom. 3.16.17. —<hi>The way of Peace they have not know.</hi> And becauſe the depraved Soul of Man <hi>loves</hi> his <hi>Error,</hi> therefore the Holy God <hi>leaves</hi> him in it. Becauſe he will not be reclaimed from it, God lets him go on in his <hi>Error.</hi> Becauſe he <hi>hates the Light,</hi> God witholds it from him. He Delights in his <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> &amp; prefers and practiſes the <hi>Works of Darkneſs</hi>; God therefore gives him up to his <hi>Darkneſs.</hi> We may add, what we read; 2. Cor. 4.4. <hi>The god of this world blinded their Minds. Satan</hi> is by the wrath of God, become the <hi>Ruler of this Dark World.</hi> Men do by Sin put themſelves under the Dominion of <hi>Satan. Satan</hi> ſhuts his poor Slaves up in thoſe <hi>Dungeons,</hi> where the Rayes of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> do not reach them. Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners enſlaved by <hi>Satan,</hi> may ſay of their Maſter, <hi>He has laid me in the loweſt Pitt, in Darkneſs, in the Deeps.</hi> They are by the Intrigues of <hi>Satan,</hi> kept ſo
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:002779_0036_0FE5F64FE3F21660"/>
full of <hi>Buſineſs,</hi> and carried unto ſuch a <hi>Diſtance</hi> from God, that they can't ſee things in a <hi>True light.</hi> So they go down to the <hi>Generation</hi> of their Fooliſh <hi>Fathers,</hi> and <hi>they never ſee light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly. We will Enquire, <hi>How it appears,</hi> that the moſt of Men <hi>Dy</hi> before they arrive unto <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> There needs no ſtronger, nor no ſadder proof of this, than what we have in the Daily <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints</hi> of <hi>Dying Men.</hi> Some <hi>Dy</hi> with very little ſenſe of what has been amiſs in their Lives. <hi>Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> has been in their <hi>Hearts while they have lived,</hi> &amp; with that <hi>Madneſs</hi> they have <hi>gone to the Dead.</hi> But, of them who are not perfect <hi>Sotts</hi> and <hi>Stones</hi> in their <hi>Death,</hi> the moſt by far, <hi>dy</hi> confeſſing and complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they have been without <hi>Wiſdom</hi> all their Dayes. They own, they have never come unto <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> until their <hi>Dying Hour</hi> be come upon them. And it is well, if <hi>now</hi> they do any more, than ſee that they have been without <hi>Wiſdom</hi>; it is well if <hi>now</hi> they come really to get any of that <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> which they have been thus long without. We read, Prov. 5.11, 12. of, <hi>Mourning at the laſt, How have I hated Inſtruction!</hi> The moſt of Men go on fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhly all their days, in ſuch Indiſcretions, that they <hi>mourn at the laſt</hi>;
<q>Oh! If <hi>I were to live over again,</hi> I would never lead my Life ſo <hi>fooliſhly</hi> as I have done! I would order my <hi>Life</hi> after another and a wiſer Manner than I have done!</q>
When that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Roman <hi>Cicero,</hi> was come towards the latter End of his <hi>Life,</hi> he cried out, <hi>O me nunquam pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſem!</hi> 'Alas, I have never done the part of a <hi>'Wiſe Man,</hi> in all my Days. Thus do the moſt of Men cry out of themſelves, at a <hi>latter End</hi> full of <hi>Bitterneſs. Dying</hi> Men ſay; <hi>We have lived without
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:002779_0037_0FE5F65445F45678"/>
Wiſdom.</hi> At their <hi>Death</hi> 'tis found and own'd, they have been without it. In a <hi>Dying</hi> Hour to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced unto the Confeſſion, <hi>I have until now been whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtitute of Wiſdom!</hi> And now, no opportunity to <hi>Exert</hi> it, or, perhaps to <hi>obtain</hi> it! —</p>
            <p>We will Enquire, Thirdly. <hi>Who they are,</hi> which <hi>Dy</hi> before they arrive unto <hi>Wiſdom.</hi> You ſhall ſhall have a brief Deſcription of them.</p>
            <p>Firſt, They who <hi>Dy Unprepared for Death,</hi> ſuch <hi>Dy without Wiſdom.</hi> The trueſt <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of Man, lies, of old they ſaid, <hi>In a Meditation of Death</hi>; I will ſay, <hi>In a Preparation for death. Death</hi> finds none but Egregious <hi>Fools Unprepared</hi> for it. We are warned, That before we <hi>dy,</hi> we muſt be <hi>prepared</hi> for it, by a <hi>Sanctifying Change</hi> upon us; <hi>Prepared</hi> for it, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Renewed in the Spirit of our Minds: Prepared</hi> for it, by turning to God, and Cloſing with Chriſt, &amp; having the Diſpoſitions which will render us <hi>meet for the Inheritance of the Saints in light.</hi> We are warned, That if we <hi>dy</hi> before we are thus <hi>Prepared</hi> for it, it will be <hi>Good for us, that we had never been born.</hi> Our <hi>Death</hi> will be but a ſort of a <hi>Trap door,</hi> by which we ſhall be thrown down into the place of <hi>Dragons,</hi> a place of <hi>Torments.</hi> It can be no <hi>Wiſdom</hi> to ſlight this warning, and neglect this <hi>Preparation</hi> for Death. Unto one <hi>Unprepared for death,</hi> it was ſaid; Luk. 12.20. <hi>Thou Fool!</hi> Oh! how juſtly, how juſtly may it be ſaid unto ſuch an one; <hi>Ah, Fool, dying without Wiſdom!</hi> The <hi>unprepared</hi> Soul, tumbles into a dreadful Eternity, with ſuch a ſhriek as that;
<q>What a <hi>Fool,</hi> Oh! what a <hi>Fool,</hi> have I been! What horrible <hi>Stripes</hi> has my <hi>Folly</hi> brought me to!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:002779_0038_0FE5F65591FD6C48"/>Secondly. They who <hi>dy, before they have begun to live,</hi> ſhall <hi>dy without Wiſdom.</hi> A Man does not <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to live,</hi> until he <hi>lives unto God.</hi> He that never begins to mind the Great <hi>Errand,</hi> which GOD ſent him into the World upon, has not <hi>begun to live.</hi> He that fills not his Life with <hi>Acknowledgements</hi> of GOD, and ſtudies not to <hi>Acknowledge God in all his ways,</hi> has not <hi>begun to live.</hi> He that lives wholly <hi>to himſelf,</hi> and ſweels away his Life, only in the <hi>Hurries,</hi> and the <hi>Pleaſures,</hi> and <hi>Amuſements</hi> of <hi>this Life</hi>; may have it ſaid of him, as, 1 Tim. 5.6. <hi>He is dead, while he lives.</hi> 'Tis not <hi>Wiſdom</hi>; No, 'Tis <hi>Folly in its Exaltation,</hi> to live at this rate. If <hi>Death</hi> overtakes a Man, while he is yet <hi>alienated from the Life of God</hi>; If <hi>Death</hi> ſiezes upon a Man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is experimentally acquainted with the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of a <hi>Godly Life:</hi> the Man <hi>dies without Wiſdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly. They who <hi>dy in their Sins,</hi> theſe <hi>dy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Wiſdom. Sin</hi> is <hi>Folly.</hi> Every Sinner is a <hi>Fool.</hi> In ſinning we bring our ſelves into cauſe for ſaying, as, 2 Sam. 24.10. <hi>I have ſinned, and I have done very fooliſhly.</hi> Men are not come to <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> till they have left off <hi>ſinning,</hi> or, while they go on ſtill in their <hi>Treſpaſſes.</hi> If Men <hi>dy</hi> before they are <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from the Error of their ways,</hi> they <hi>dy without Wiſdom.</hi> To <hi>dy Unpardoned,</hi> is to <hi>dy Miſerable.</hi> To <hi>dy</hi> with Sin unbewailed, and unforſaken, and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of, is to <hi>dy Unpardoned.</hi> So to <hi>dy</hi> — with <hi>Folly</hi> not abandoned, nor forgiven; To <hi>dy,</hi> with <hi>the Wrath of God yet abiding</hi> on the Soul; To <hi>dy,</hi> and carry away a <hi>Guilty Conſcience,</hi> which will gnaw, and ſcourge, and vex the Soul, and be within it, a <hi>Worm that will never dy</hi>! Certainly, tis no <hi>Wiſdom</hi> to <hi>dy</hi> ſo!</p>

            <p>But my Diſcourſe muſt paſs into a moſt Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate <hi>Exhortation.</hi> And it is an Exhortation, to be managed with the moſt Vehement <hi>Importunity,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are every one of us very nearly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it. If any one of us could promiſe himſelf to be excuſed from <hi>dying</hi> at all; Yea, or if any one of us could promiſe himſelf to <hi>live</hi> ſo much as <hi>One Day</hi> longer, the <hi>Exhortation</hi> might ſuffer ſome A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement of the Flame in which it muſt come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us. Oh! But not one of us can promiſe any ſuch matter. We are all concerned. My Addreſs muſt be as extenſive as that; Pſal. 49.1. <hi>Hear this, all ye People.</hi> This muſt be the <hi>Exhortation</hi> to us all. <hi>Immediately, Immediately</hi> become ſo <hi>wiſe,</hi> as to get beyond the Danger of <hi>dying without Wiſdom.</hi> If you enquire, and methinks you ſhould be Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, <hi>What is that Wiſdom?</hi> GOD Himſelf ſhall give you an Anſwer, Job 28.28. <hi>And unto Man he ſaid, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is Wiſdom, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from evil, that is Underſtanding.</hi> Syrs, be aſſured of this. A Man may have the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> to <hi>Govern</hi> and <hi>Manage</hi> whole Nations of Men; but if he <hi>dy</hi> without any better <hi>Wiſdom, How art thou fallen from Heaven, O Lucifer, Son of the Morning,</hi> who didſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Nations? A Man may have the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> to underſtand as many <hi>Languages</hi> as a <hi>Mithridates</hi>; but if he <hi>dy</hi> without better <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> he muſt be lodg'd where he ſhall gnaw his Tongue for Pain, &amp; know no <hi>Language</hi> but that of Roaring and of Blaſphemy. A Man may have the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> to Calculate all the Motions of the <hi>Heavens</hi>; but if he <hi>dy</hi> without bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

               <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> he muſt go down to <hi>Hell,</hi> and lie in reſtleſs <hi>Chains of Darkneſs</hi> there. An acute Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, will not by all his Wiſdom, avoid a worſe Fate than that of an <hi>Empedocles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The greateſt Caſe that ever can be ſpoken to, is now to be briefly ſpoken to. <hi>What ſhall a Perſon do, that he may be reſcued and preſerved from the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs of dying without Wiſdom?</hi> O my dying Friends; Hearken, Hearken to the Counſils of GOD; the Dictates and the Leſſons of the trueſt <hi>Wiſdom</hi>!</p>
            <p>Firſt. You muſt <hi>Repent of all your Folly</hi> before you <hi>dy</hi>; Elſe you will <hi>dy without Wiſdom.</hi> To <hi>Sin</hi> is to <hi>play the Fool.</hi> To go on in Sin, is to go aſtray in the <hi>Greatneſs of our Folly.</hi> To walk in the way of Sin, is to <hi>wander from the way of Underſtanding. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> is a <hi>Reſipiſcence</hi>; 'tis a <hi>growing wiſe again.</hi> In <hi>Repentance</hi> a Man does that thing; Luk. 15.17. <hi>come to himſelf.</hi> The Sinners <hi>dy without Wiſdom</hi> ſurely, who go out of the world before they <hi>come to themſelves.</hi> Ah, <hi>Dying People</hi>; This, This you have to do before you <hi>dy.</hi> You muſt <hi>Lament</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, the Miſcarriages which your Lives have been fill'd withal; the Violations of His Holy and Juſt and Good Laws, in the Courſe of your Lives; Eſteem it a moſt <hi>Lamentable</hi> Thing, that you have <hi>offended</hi> Him: You muſt lay to heart that <hi>fountain</hi> of all wickedneſs every one of us has in his own deſperately wicked Heart; that <hi>evil Heart of unbelief, which inclines us to depart from the living God.</hi> You muſt apprehend <hi>Sin</hi> as the <hi>worſt evil</hi>; be apprehenſive of an hideous and horrid e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil enwrapped in it; eſpecially, as it is a <hi>Denial of the God that is Above.</hi> You muſt loath and Judge
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:002779_0041_0FE5F65D878C5B98"/>
yourſelves, as worthy of a terrible <hi>Deſtruction from God,</hi> for the offence that your Sin has given to His Infinite Majeſty. You muſt Believe that He is a <hi>God ready to Pardon.</hi> Believe the <hi>offer</hi> which He makes of His <hi>Pardoning Mercy</hi> unto the <hi>Chief of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi> Believe the <hi>purchaſe</hi> which the Blood of your Saviour has made of a <hi>Pardon,</hi> for all that will em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the <hi>offer.</hi> You muſt <hi>Accept</hi> this aſtoniſhing <hi>Offer.</hi> But Accept it, with a ſincere <hi>Deſire,</hi> a ſteady <hi>Purpoſe</hi> to <hi>Tranſgreſs no more.</hi> Sincerely and ſtedily ſay, <hi>I will not offend any more.</hi> And if you have <hi>wrong'd</hi> your <hi>Neighbour,</hi> you muſt endeavour all ſuitable <hi>Reparation</hi> and <hi>Reſtitution.</hi> You <hi>dy without Wiſdom,</hi> if you dy without ſuch a <hi>Repentance.</hi> Oh! Let it not after this be ſaid, as, Jer. 8.6. <hi>No Man Repented him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly. You muſt make ſure of an Intereſt in a Glorious CHRIST, before you <hi>dy</hi>; elſe you will <hi>dy without Wiſdom.</hi> You are ſenſible, That our Great Redeemer, is for many and weighty Cauſes in the Sacred Scriptures, called by the Name of, <hi>Wiſdom.</hi> We read, 1 Cor. 1.30. <hi>He is of GOD, made unto us, Wiſdom.</hi> Then to dy <hi>without Chriſt,</hi> is to <hi>dy without Wiſdom.</hi> Wherefore, This you have to do before you <hi>dy.</hi> You muſt come to an <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,</hi> and an <hi>Union,</hi> with your only Saviour. You muſt conſent unto that <hi>Covenant,</hi> which your Saviour, as the Head of His People, has made with His Eternal <hi>Father</hi>; and be willing that He ſhould not only make <hi>Expiation</hi> for your Sins, but alſo Quicken you and Aſſiſt you to <hi>Live</hi> unto Him. You muſt Receive your Saviour in all His <hi>Offices,</hi> and with all His <hi>Benefits,</hi> and have a Soul raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with His <hi>Excellencies</hi>; and <hi>commit</hi> your all into
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:002779_0042_0FE5F65F132394F8"/>
His Hands, and <hi>Rely</hi> upon Him for all the Bleſſings of Goodneſs. Oh! Let no one dare to <hi>dy,</hi> till he has done this. To <hi>dy Chriſtleſs</hi> is to <hi>dy without Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> and <hi>without Hope</hi> of Bleſſedneſs! <hi>Faith</hi> is in the New Teſtament ever now and then called, <hi>Wiſdom.</hi> If you <hi>dy,</hi> before you have <hi>obtained a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Faith</hi> in the only Saviour, you <hi>dy without Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> and the <hi>Goſpel</hi> being <hi>hid</hi> from you, you are <hi>Loſt, Loſt</hi> for ever. If a <hi>Chriſt</hi> be not your <hi>Portion,</hi> you have your <hi>Portion with Unbelievers</hi>; A Portion from which, <hi>O Lord, I beſeech thee, deliver my Soul</hi>!</p>
            <p>Thirdly. You muſt have your Minds rectified with a <hi>Principle of Grace,</hi> before you <hi>dy</hi>; elſe you will <hi>dy without Wiſdom.</hi> That <hi>Principle of Grace,</hi> which purifies the Soul of a Sinner from his Evil Tendencies, and makes a New Creature of him, is moſt reaſonably called, <hi>Wiſdom.</hi> Thus we read; Pſal. 51.6. Of <hi>Wiſdom in the Hidden Part.</hi> A <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Grace,</hi> will cauſe a Man to act <hi>wiſely.</hi> To <hi>fear</hi> GOD, and <hi>prize</hi> His Chriſt, and <hi>hate</hi> all Sin, and <hi>ſleight</hi> this World, and <hi>bear</hi> Afflictions patiently and fruitfully, and be a <hi>good Steward</hi> of the manifold Favours of GOD, and be a <hi>Bleſſing</hi> in all Relations, and keep joyfully looking for the <hi>Mercy</hi> of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt in an <hi>Everlaſting Life</hi>: This is to act <hi>wiſely.</hi> A <hi>Principle of Grace</hi> will produce this <hi>wiſe Behaviour.</hi> A Soul diſmiſs'd by <hi>Death,</hi> being found under the power of ſuch a <hi>Principle,</hi> will be found <hi>mark'd</hi> for the Heavenly World. It has the <hi>Marks of the Lord</hi> upon it. A Soul then found without ſuch a <hi>Principle,</hi> will be found without any Claim to the Bleſſings of the <hi>Heavenly Places.</hi> It will be claim'd by the <hi>Deſtroyer</hi>; and it can have nothing but a <hi>fearful Expectation of a fiery Indignation.</hi>

My Neighbours, Before you <hi>dy,</hi> you muſt with a <hi>Converſion</hi> to GOD, have a <hi>Principle of Grace</hi> wrought in your Souls. And therefore, you muſt <hi>Cry to the God of all Grace,</hi> and <hi>wait</hi> on Him for it, with a moſt unſpeakable Agony. You muſt <hi>Reſign</hi> your ſelves unto the <hi>Spirit of Grace,</hi> and ſollicit, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain His <hi>Influences,</hi> and ſubmit to, and fall in with, His <hi>Operations.</hi> Keep doing ſo, while you <hi>Live</hi>; Keep doing it, as for your <hi>Lives.</hi> Tremble, Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the Thought of <hi>dying,</hi> till you have in you, the <hi>Spring of Everlaſting Life</hi>!</p>
            <p>Fourthly. You muſt <hi>wiſely Meaſure,</hi> and <hi>wiſely Employ,</hi> the <hi>Time of your Lives</hi>; otherwiſe you will be without <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> at the <hi>End of your Lives.</hi> 'Tis <hi>Wiſdom</hi> to <hi>Meaſure</hi> our Time well. Thus we read; Pſal. 90.12. <hi>So teach us to number our Days, that we may apply our Hearts unto Wiſdom.</hi> 'Tis <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> not to allot upon more <hi>Days</hi> than we have Reaſon for. 'Tis <hi>Wiſdom</hi> to allow, that for ought we know, we are entred into the very <hi>laſt</hi> of our <hi>Days.</hi> Again, 'Tis <hi>Wiſdom</hi> to Employ our <hi>Time</hi> well. Thus we read; Eph. 5.15, 16. <hi>See then that ye walk circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectly, not as fools but as wiſe, redeeming the Time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Days are evil.</hi> 'Tis <hi>Wiſdom</hi> to ſpend our Hours, in ſuch a manner that we may give a <hi>good Account</hi> how we have ſpent them. 'Tis <hi>Wiſdom</hi> not to throw away our <hi>Hours</hi> impertinently, but be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways either <hi>doing</hi> or <hi>getting</hi> of Good in them all. Mind it then, Syrs. You will <hi>dy without Wiſdom,</hi> if your <hi>Death</hi> ſurprize you; if your <hi>Death</hi> come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly;— if at your <hi>Death</hi> you muſt ſay; <hi>I never look'd for this! I did not imagine that I could be ſo near to this.</hi> You will <hi>dy without Wiſdom,</hi> if your <hi>Death</hi> come upon you, before you have learnt the
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:002779_0044_0FE5F66A6A584D30"/>
Skill of <hi>Living Uſefully</hi>; if your <hi>Death</hi> cut you down, before you are grown <hi>Fruitful in good Works</hi>; and bring forth much <hi>Fruit unto God.</hi> Oh! Beware of this.</p>
            <p>Fifthly. To Eſcape the <hi>Finiſhed Folly of Dying without Wiſdom,</hi> one way is, To <hi>Learn Wiſdom from the Dying.</hi> Verily, <hi>The Thoughts of a Dying Man,</hi> are thoſe wherein Ordinarily you hear <hi>Wiſdom Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> even by thoſe who never in all their Days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have been the <hi>Children</hi> of it. The <hi>Wiſdom</hi> which the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Exalted Folly</hi> have derided, while they thought of nothing but living always here, is, in <hi>The Thoughts of a Dying Man,</hi> how Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, how Applauded, how Recommended unto the Survivers! When Men ſee the <hi>Days of the life of their Vanity</hi> come to their period, they Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend unto the World, the <hi>Religion</hi> of GOD our SAVIOUR, and a Conformity to the <hi>Maxims</hi> of it, as the only <hi>Wiſdom</hi> in the World! Ask a Dying Man, <hi>What is the Wiſeſt Courſe that can be taken?</hi> He will ſay;
<q>Oh! <hi>live</hi> to GOD, and <hi>live</hi> by the <hi>Faith</hi> of the SON of GOD, as ſoon and as much as ever you can; And fill your <hi>life</hi> with Acts of <hi>Devotion</hi> towards GOD, and with Acts of <hi>Benigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> towards Man; And let the <hi>Views</hi> of a <hi>life to come</hi> govern you <hi>in all Manner of Converſation.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Such Things you have a thouſand and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times heard from the Quivering <hi>Lips,</hi> that have had an Immortal Soul juſt Expiring from them. Won't you <hi>hearken to the Voice</hi> of ſuch <hi>Teachers,</hi> but <hi>Mourn at the laſt,</hi> for your Obſtinacy and Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence? <hi>O ye Fools, when will you be wiſe!</hi> —</p>
            <p>And now, The Great GOD has ordered it, that a Number of <hi>Dying Men</hi> appear among us, in
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:002779_0045_0FE5F66CCA8636C0"/>
ſome Tragical and peculiar Circumſtances. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Company of PIRATES under <hi>Sentence of Death</hi> appear among us, and are within a few Hours to be Executed.</p>
            <p>Certainly, It will be the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of us all, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially of our <hi>Sea-faring Tribe,</hi> to learn from theſe <hi>Dying Men,</hi> ſome things which the <hi>living</hi> that <hi>ſee the End</hi> of theſe Men muſt <hi>lay to Heart,</hi> — if they would not with an <hi>Hard Heart</hi> lay up for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>Treaſures of Wrath,</hi> to be poured out upon them, in the <hi>Righteous Judgment</hi> of GOD.</p>
            <p>Learn from theſe poor Men, the Miſchief of thoſe <hi>Two Vices,</hi> wherein ſo many of the <hi>Sea-faring Tribe</hi> ſuffer the doleful <hi>Shipwreck</hi> of their Souls, and are <hi>drowned in Perdition.</hi> The firſt, that of <hi>Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>; And then, that of profane <hi>Swearing</hi> and <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</hi> Theſe poor Men do, with unutterable An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh cry out, under the heavy Load of <hi>Guilt,</hi> which theſe Two Vices have laid and left upon them. The former Vice, <hi>reſigns</hi> the Sinner up to the <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> of the <hi>Devil</hi>; and by Conſequence, to all manner of Wickedneſs. The latter Vice, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares</hi> that the <hi>Devil</hi> has taken an horrible <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> of the Sinner, and the Wretch cannot now ſo truly ſay, what he uſe to do, <hi>My Tongue is my own</hi>; as he may ſay, <hi>'Tis the Devils</hi>: And being <hi>Set on Fire of Hell,</hi> 'tis plain, what and where a <hi>Torment</hi> is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for it. Being thus <hi>Warned</hi> of them, Oh! <hi>Steer clear</hi> of the <hi>Rocks,</hi> where you ſee the <hi>Breakers</hi> before you!</p>
            <p>At the ſame time, when, Oh! when, will the <hi>Sea</hi> no longer have cauſe to ſay of <hi>Wiſdom, It is not in me</hi>! And complain that they who follow the <hi>Sea,</hi> will ſo <hi>Madly</hi> as they do, abandon themſelves,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:002779_0046_0FE5F66DF390D228"/>
and let their Souls <hi>drive</hi> to the Courſes of <hi>Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction</hi>! Poor Sailours, Will you never hearken to the <hi>Voice of Wiſdom?</hi> Always be <hi>Madmen,</hi> and with <hi>Madneſs in your Hearts go to the Dead?</hi> Never become a Pious, a Sober, a Serious, and a Prudent Generation? Let the Condition of theſe Poor Men help you to <hi>receive Inſtruction</hi> and <hi>acquaint your Hearts with Wiſdom.</hi> In their Condition you ſee, that if you <hi>go on ſtill in your Treſpaſſes</hi> a Provoked GOD can by the Hands of <hi>Sea-Monſters,</hi> which thro' His <hi>Curſe</hi> upon you do <hi>Increaſe and Multiply,</hi> &amp; become the <hi>Terror of them that haunt the Sea,</hi> bring ſore plagues upon you: And even one of theſe <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathans</hi> have a permiſſion to pillage no leſs than Four Hundred Veſſels of you. Yea, and what is infinitely worſe; In <hi>their</hi> Condition you ſee what <hi>you</hi> may be left unto: And how far, if you remain Incorrigible in your evil ways, the Juſtice of GOD may give you up to the <hi>Luſts of your own Hearts,</hi> and leave you to do thoſe things, which may bring a <hi>fearful End</hi> upon you, that once you little imagined. <hi>Oh! What may you come to!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Friends; <hi>Be Admoniſhed by theſe things</hi>; And, <hi>Be wiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But while I am addreſſing the poor <hi>Sailours,</hi> and beſeeching them, that they would not let the <hi>Devil,</hi> who is the worſt of <hi>Maſters,</hi> enſlave them, nor have their <hi>Names</hi> in the <hi>Book</hi> of, <hi>The Wicked one,</hi> I would preſume upon an Addreſs to the <hi>Maſters</hi> of our Veſſels, that they would not be too like the <hi>Devil,</hi> in their <hi>Barbarous Uſage</hi> of the <hi>Men</hi> that are under them, and lay them under <hi>Temptations</hi> to do <hi>Deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Things.</hi> We allow, Syrs, That you muſt be <hi>Commanders</hi> aboard, and you muſt keep a <hi>ſtrict Hand</hi>
               <pb n="45" facs="unknown:002779_0047_0FE5F66ECB35F6F0"/>
over your Men; and you may, <hi>as Times go,</hi> too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten have occaſions for <hi>Severities</hi>; But ſtill, there muſt be no room for <hi>Barbarities.</hi> Our beſt <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders</hi> find they can do without ſuch Things. The <hi>Men</hi> muſt be uſed as <hi>Rational Creatures.</hi> Yea, <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> you muſt Remember your MEN, — Don't you call 'em ſo? — They are your <hi>Brethren.</hi> And you would certainly find it ſo, that with a <hi>Merciful Uſage</hi> of your <hi>Men,</hi> if you wiſely maintain the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes</hi> of PIETY aboard your Veſſels, and be your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves bright <hi>Examples</hi> of it, your GOD, and the <hi>Conſcience</hi> that ſpeaks from and for Him in your <hi>Men,</hi> would be on <hi>your ſide,</hi> and your <hi>Authority</hi> would be ſufficiently Eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>I Conclude. And, <hi>Hear this, O all ye People, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of you</hi>! You cannot be ſecured from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible, the Incomprehenſible <hi>Infelicity</hi> of, <hi>Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without Wiſdom,</hi> if you do not immediately come into a fixed RESOLUTION, for that which is, <hi>The Beginning of Wiſdom: Reſolved</hi> for the <hi>Fear of God,</hi> and a <hi>Life of Religion.</hi> Oh! Be not ſo <hi>Exceeding Mad,</hi> any of you, as to remain <hi>Unreſolved,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Glorious GOD be not worthy of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Homage from you; whether a Gracious RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEEMER have not ſuch Things to do for you, as are worth your looking to Him for; whether the <hi>Spiritual Bleſſings in Heavenly places,</hi> are not rather to be choſen, than a <hi>Devouring Fire, and Everlaſting Burnings!</hi> Will our <hi>young People,</hi> be ſo <hi>wiſe</hi> now, as to <hi>Conſider their Latter End</hi>! We read of ſuch a Thing as that; Prov. 1.4. <hi>Giving to the young Man Diſcretion.</hi> The word for, <hi>Diſcretion,</hi> there, may be rendred, <hi>Thoughtfulneſs.</hi> Oh! That our <hi>young Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> would be ſo <hi>Diſcrete</hi> as to be more <hi>Thoughtful</hi>

than they often are! Oh! that they might be able to ſay, <hi>I thought on my ways, and I turned my Feet unto the ways, whereto GOD has born His Teſtimonies.</hi> And, Children, I now more particularly Demand your <hi>Thoughts</hi> on two <hi>Queſtions,</hi> in the <hi>Catechiſm for Conſcience,</hi> which continually comes upon you.</p>
            <p>I demand it of you, whether you are ſure of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more <hi>Time</hi> to get <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> than <hi>this very Moment,</hi> before you <hi>dy?</hi> GOD has taught you an Anſwer to this Queſtion; Prov. 7.5. <hi>Boaſt not thy ſelf of To<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>morrow; for thou knoweſt not what a Day may bring forth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I demand it of you, whether if you <hi>dy without Wiſdom,</hi> your <hi>Folly</hi> will not be inexcuſable, your <hi>Horror</hi> intolerable, your <hi>Torture</hi> inſupportable? God has taught you an Anſwer to this Queſtion; Heb. 10.31. <hi>It is a fearful thing to fall into the Hands of the Living GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I hope 'tis no longer a matter of Suſpenſe with you; But you are come to a point, <hi>Great God, Thro' thy CHRIST I deſire to live unto thee.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>AND now, <hi>ſpeedily,</hi> that is to ſay, On <hi>Tueſday,</hi> the <hi>Sentence againſt the Evil Works</hi> of theſe Men, muſt be executed. One of the Four, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Condick,</hi> was Reprieved. As for <hi>Fly,</hi> he had been all along, a moſt uncommon and amazing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Impenitency and Stupidity, and what <hi>Spectacles of Obduration</hi> the Wicked will be, when they have by a courſe of Wickedneſs under and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Warnings, provoked the GOD of Heaven to withold His Influences from them. The Sullen and Raging Mood, into which he fell, upon his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt <hi>Impriſon'd,</hi> cauſed him to break forth into furious Execrations, and Blaſphemies too hideous to be mention'd; and not eat one morſel of any thing, but ſubſiſt only upon a little Drinking, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the remaining part of his Life. He decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned appearing in the Public Aſſemblies, on the <hi>Lords-day,</hi> with the other Priſoners, to be under the appointed means of Grace, becauſe, forſooth, <hi>he would not have the Mob to gaze upon him.</hi> He ſeem'd all along ambitious to have it ſaid, <hi>That he died a brave fellow</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He paſs'd along to the place of Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, with a <hi>Noſegay</hi> in his hand, and making his <hi>Complements,</hi> where he <hi>thought he ſaw occaſion.</hi> Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving there, he nimbly mounted the Stage, and would fain have put on a Smiling Aſpect. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached the Hangman, for not underſtanding his Trade, and with his own Hands rectified matters, to render all things more Convenient and Effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="unknown:002779_0050_0FE5F67A7A5B6078"/>When he was called upon, to <hi>Speak</hi> what he ſhould judge proper to be ſpoken on that ſad occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, at leaſt for the Warning of Survivers, he only ſaid, That <hi>he would adviſe the Maſters of Veſſels to carry it well to their Men, leſt they ſhould be put upon do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as he had done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the ſame time, he declared his obſtinate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal, to <hi>Forgive</hi> the Perſon that had been the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of bringing him to Juſtice. When the Neceſſity of that <hi>Charity</hi> was urgently preſs'd upon him; and advantage taken from a Recital of the <hi>Lords-Prayer</hi> uſed among the Devotions of the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals on the preſent Occaſion, to urge it; he ſtill perſiſted in his <hi>Unrelenting Frame</hi>; and an Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that Importance was in the laſt words, he Expired withal. But it was obſerved and is affirm'd, by ſome Spectators, that in the Midſt of all his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected <hi>Bravery,</hi> a very ſenſible <hi>Trembling</hi> attended him; His hands and his <hi>Knees</hi> were plainly ſeen to <hi>Tremble.</hi> — And ſo we muſt leave him for the <hi>Judgment to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other Two, <hi>Cole</hi> and <hi>Greenville,</hi> had much greater Signs of <hi>Repentance</hi> upon them. They made their <hi>Prayers,</hi> and ſeem'd continually <hi>praying,</hi> and much affected. They deſired the Spectators to take <hi>Warning</hi> by them. And they mentioned Profane <hi>Swearing</hi> and <hi>Curſing,</hi> with <hi>Drunkenneſs</hi> and <hi>Sabbath-breaking,</hi> as Crimes which were now particularly grievous to them. They alſo juſtified the <hi>Court,</hi> as well as acknowledged the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of the Glorious GOD, in the Puniſhment they were now brought unto.</p>

               <pb n="49" facs="unknown:002779_0051_0FE5F67B50866478"/>A Miniſter preſent having made a Pertinent and Pathetic <hi>Prayer,</hi> the Officer, willing that all that was poſſible might be done for their good, after ſome time, ask'd them, whether they would have another <hi>Prayer. Fly</hi> did not accept the offer, but ſaid, <hi>If the other Two be Ready, I am</hi>! However, the <hi>other Two</hi> deſiring it, another ſuch <hi>prayer</hi> was made by another Miniſter; and after <hi>that,</hi> another by a Third; with which they joined attentively. (while <hi>Fly</hi> look'd about him unconcerned.)</p>
            <p>Then the Execution was finiſhed; And <hi>Fly</hi>'s Carcaſe hanged in Chains, on an Iſland, at the Entrance into <hi>Boſton</hi>-Harbour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cole,</hi> being one that could uſe his Pen, did on the Morning before his Execution, give out a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, in which
<q>he Lamented his early accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of himſelf to Profane <hi>Swearing</hi>; and Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Language</hi>; and Exceſſive <hi>Drinking</hi>; and his frequent <hi>ſtealing of Liquors</hi> from his Maſter, for the Satisfaction of them who hired him to do it. He added his bitter Lamentations, that when he came to <hi>Man's Eſtate,</hi> he abandoned himſelf to criminal Pleaſures, to <hi>Drinking, Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, Whoring,</hi> and the reſt. He begg'd all <hi>Sea-faring-Men</hi> to take Warning by his Ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious and Miſerable Death; to which he was now brought, by the Enticements of the Wicked. He confeſs'd himſelf to be juſtly Condemned; and gave abundance of Thanks, for the Aſſiſtance of Good Miniſters, and the wholeſome Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and holy Directions they had given him, and
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:002779_0052_0FE632559C010588"/>
and expreſs'd his Hope of entring into Heaven, by the Blood of His Glorious Redeemer.</q>
And he earneſtly deſired, that this Paper might be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed to the World.</p>
            <p>The poor Man, in the Priſon, had owned unto a Miniſter, That from the Moment of the <hi>Murders</hi> on Board, he never had a minutes Quiet in his Mind, but was continually Meditating how to run away from the <hi>whole World,</hi> and if it were poſſible run away from <hi>himſelf.</hi> The Apprehenſion of his having ſome Intention to knock the <hi>Veſſel</hi> on the Head, and perhaps the <hi>Captain,</hi> cauſed them, for ſome Days before Mr. <hi>Atkinſon</hi>'s happy Revolution, to lay him in <hi>Irons,</hi> and every Day cruelly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow more than an Hundred Laſhes upon him; whereof he continued Sore to his Death. He now ſaw the Glorious GOD, beginning to Execute on him <hi>His</hi> Vengeance, by the Hands of his <hi>own</hi> Bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Companions: And he endured ſuch <hi>Miſeries,</hi> as made him look upon his forlorn Circumſtances in the <hi>Boſton</hi>-Gaol, as a ſort of a Deliverance. It was <hi>there</hi> endeavoured, that this <hi>Conſtruction</hi> of his <hi>Miſeries</hi> might be ſet home upon him. However, it was admirable to ſee, how the Vengeance of GOD, ſometimes makes <hi>Aceomplices</hi> in Sin, horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Scourges</hi> to one another!</p>
            <p>It was a Saying of the <hi>Orientals, Happy is he, who corrects his Faults by the Faults of others.</hi> And now, <hi>Happy</hi> would our <hi>Sea-faring</hi> People particularly be, if the <hi>Crimes</hi> and the <hi>Ends</hi> of ſome whom they have ſeen <hi>Drowned in Perdition,</hi> might effectually cauſe them to beware of the <hi>Faults.</hi> with which they may any of them charge themſelves.</p>
