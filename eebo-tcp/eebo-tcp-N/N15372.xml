            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE ADVENTURES, OF COL. DANIEL BOON.</head>
            <p>IT was on the firſt of May 1769, that I reſigned my domeſtic happineſs, and left my family and peaceable habitation on the Yadkin River, in North-Carolina, to wander through the wilderneſs of America, in queſt of the country of Kentucke, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with John Finlay, John Stuart, Joſeph Molden, James Monay, and William Cool.</p>
            <p>On the 7th day of June, after travelling in a weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern direction, we found ourſelves an Red River, where John Finaly had formerly been trading with the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and from the top of an eminence, few with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the beautiful level of Kentucke. For ſome time we had experienced the moſt uncomfortable weather. We now encamped, made a ſhelter to defend us from the inclement ſeaſon, and began to hunt and reconnoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre the country. We found abundance of wild beaſts in this vaſt foreſt. The buffaloes were more numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than cattle on other ſettlements, browzing on the leaves of the cane, or croſſing the herbage on thoſe extenſive plains, we ſaw hundreds in a drove, and the numbers about the ſalt ſprings were amazing. In this foreſt the habitation of beaſts of every American kind, we hunted with great ſucceſs until December.</p>
            <p>On the 22d of December John Stuart and I had a pleaſant Ramble; but fortune changed the day at the cloſe of it. We had paſſed through a great foreſt, in which ſtood myriads of trees, ſome gay with bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms, other rich with fruits. Nature was here a ſeries of wonders and a fund of delight. Here ſhe diſplayed her ingenuity and induſtry in a variety of flowers and
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:019514_0003_0FABF5B9AEE34BC0"/>
fruits, beautifully coloured, elegantly ſhaped, and charmingly flavoured; and we were diverted with numberleſs animals preſenting themſelves perpetually to our view. In the decline of the day, near Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tucke river, as we aſcended the brow of a ſmall hill, a number of Indians ruſhed out of a thick cane brake, and made us priſoners. The Indians plundered us, and kept us in confinement ſeven days. During this we diſcovered no uneaſineſs or deſire to eſcape, which made them leſs ſuſpicious: but in the dead of the night, as we lay by a large fire, in a thick cane brake, when ſleep had locked up their ſenſes, my ſituation not diſposing me to reſt, I gently awoke my compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. We ſeized this favourable opportunity and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, directing our courſe towards our old camp, but found it plundered and our people diſperſed or gone home.</p>
            <p>About this time my brother, Squire Boon, with another adventurer, who came to explore the country ſhortly after us, was wandering through the foreſt, and accidentally found our camp. Notwithſtanding our unfortunate circumſtances, and our dangerous ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation ſurrounded with hoſtile ſavages, our meeting fortunately in the wilderneſs, gave us the moſt ſenſible ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>Soon after this my companion in captivity, John Stewart was killed by the ſavages, and the man that came with my brother returned home by himſelf. We were then in a dangerous helpleſs ſituation, expoſed daily to perils and death, among ſavages and wild beaſts, not a white man in the country but ourſelves.</p>
            <p>Thus many hundred miles from our families in the howling wilderneſs, we did not continue in a ſtate of indolence, but hunted every day, and prepared a little cottage to defend us from the winter ſtorms. We met with no diſturbance during the winter. On the 1ſt of May 1770, my brother returned home by himſelf for a new recruit of horſes and amunition, leaving me alone, without bread, ſalt, or ſugar, or even a horſe or a dog, I paſſed a few days uncomfortably. The idea
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:019514_0004_0FABF5BA6DDB4DB8"/>
of a beloved wife and family, and their anxiety on my account, would have diſpoſed me to melancholy, if I had further indulged the thought.</p>
            <p>One day I undertook a tour through the country, when the diverſity and beauties of nature I met with in this charming ſeaſon, expelled every gloomy thought. Juſt at the cloſe of the day, the gentle gales ceaſed; a profound calm enſued; not a breath ſhook the tremulous leaf. I had gained the ſummit of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding ridge, and looking round with aſtoniſhing delight, beheld the ample plains and beauteous tracts below. On one hand I ſurveyed the famous Ohio rolling in ſilent dignity, and marking the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern bounds of Kentucke with inconceivable grandure. At a vaſt diſtance I beheld the mountains lift their venerable brows and penetrate the clouds. All things were ſtill. I kindled a fire near a fountain of ſweet water, and feaſted on the loin of a buck, which a few hours before I had killed. The ſhades of night ſoon overſpread the hemiſphere, and the earth ſeem to gaſp after the hovering moiſture. My excurſion had fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigued my body, and amuſed my mind. I laid me down to ſleep and awoke not until the ſun had chaſed away the night. I continued this tour, and in a few days explored a conſiderable part of the country, each day equally pleaſed as the firſt; after which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to my old camp, which had not been diſturbed in my abſence I did not confine my lodgings to it, but often repoſed in thick cane brakes to avoid the ſavages, who I believe, often viſited my camp, but fortunately for me in my abſence. No populous city with all the varieties of commerce and ſtately ſtructures, could afford ſuch pleaſure to my mind, as the beauties of nature I found in this country.</p>
            <p>Until the 27th of July I ſpent the time in an unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted ſcene of ſylvan pleaſures, when my brother to my great felicity, met me according to appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, at our old camp. Soon after we left the place, and proceeded to Cumberland River, reconnoitring that part of the country, and giving names to the different rivers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:019514_0005_0FABF5BB338AB7A8"/>In March 1771 I returned home to my family, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing determined to bring them as ſoon as poſſible at the riſk of my life and fortune, to reſide in Kentucke, which I eſteemed a ſecond paradiſe.</p>
            <p>On my return I found my family in happy circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. I ſold my farm on the Yadkin, and what goods we could not carry with us; and</p>
            <p>On the 25th of September 1773, we bade farewel to our friends and proceeded on our journey to Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tucke, in company with five more families, and forty men that joined us in Powell's Valley, which is one hundred and fifty miles from the now ſettled parts of Kentucke; but this promiſing beginning was ſoon overcaſt with a cloud of adverſity.</p>
            <p>On the 10th of October the rear of our company was <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>ked by a number of Indians; who killed ſix, and wounded one man. Of theſe my <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>deſt ſon was one that fell in the action. Though we repulſed the enemy, yet this unhappy affair ſcattered our cattle, brought us into extreme difficulty, and ſo diſcouraged the whole company, that we retreated forty miles to the ſettlement on the Clench river. We had paſſed over two mountains Powell's and Walden's, and were approaching Cumberland mountain, when this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe fortune overtook us. Theſe mountains are in the wilderneſs, in paſſing from the old ſettlements in Virginia to Kentucke, are ranged in a ſouthweſt and northeaſt direction, are of great length and breadth, and not far diſtant from each other. Over them na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has formed paſſes leſs difficult than might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from the view of ſuch huge piles, The aſpect of theſe cliffs are ſo wild and ho<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>d, that is impoſſible to behold them without terror.</p>
            <p>Until the 6th of June 1774, I remained with my family on the Clinch, when I and Michael S<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oner were ſolicited by Governor Dunmore of Virginia, to conduct a number of ſurveyors to the falls of the Ohio. This was a tour of 800 miles, and look us ſixty-two days.</p>
            <p>On my return, Govornor Dunmore gave me the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:019514_0006_0FABF5BBED9CAE78"/>
command of three gariſons, during the campaign a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Shawneſe.</p>
            <p>In March 1775, at the ſolicitation of a number of gentlemen of North-Carolina, I attended their treaty at Wataga, with the Cherokee Indians, to purchaſe the lands on the ſouth ſide of Kentucke river. After this I undertook to mark out a road in the beſt paſſage from the ſettlements through the wilderneſs to Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tucke.</p>
            <p>Having collected a number of enterprizing men well armed, I ſoon begun this work, we proceeded until we came within fifteen miles of where Boonſborough now ſtands, where the Indians attacked us, and killed two and wounded two more.</p>
            <p>This was the 2d of March 1775. Three days after they attacked us again, we had two killed and three wounded. After this we proceeded on to Kentucke river without oppoſition.</p>
            <p>On the firſt of April we began to erect the ſort of Boonſborough, at a ſalt lick 60 yards from the river on the ſouth ſide.</p>
            <p>On the 4th they killed one of our men.</p>
            <p>On the 14th of June having finiſhed the fort, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to my family on the Clinch. Soon after I removed my family to this fort; we arrived ſafe; my wife and daughter being the firſt white women that ſtood on the banks of Kentucke river.</p>
            <p>December the 24th. the Indians killed one man and wounded another, ſeeming determined to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute us for erecting this fort.</p>
            <p>July 14th 1776. Two of Colonel Calaway's daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and one of mine, were taken priſoners near the fort. I immediately purſued the Indians, with only eight men.</p>
            <p>On the 16th I overtook them, killed two of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and recovered the girls.</p>
            <p>The Indians had divided themſelves into ſeveral parties and attacked on the ſame day all our ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and forts, doing a great deal of miſchief. The huſbandmen were ſhot down in the field, and moſt of
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:019514_0007_0FABF5BCDBD88658"/>
the cattle were deſtroyed. They continued their hoſtilities until</p>
            <p>The 15th of April 1777, when a party of 100 of them attacked Boonſborough, and killed one man, and wounded four.</p>
            <p>July 4th they attacked it again with 250 men, and killed us one, and wounded two. They remained 48 hours, during which we killed ſeven of them. All the ſettlements were attacked at the ſame time.</p>
            <p>July 19th. Colonel Logan's fort was beſieged by 200 Indians; they did much miſchief; there were only fifteen men in the fort; they killed two and wounded one of them. Indians loſs unknown.</p>
            <p>July 25. Twenty five men came from Carolina. About</p>
            <p>Auguſt 20th, Colonel Bowman arrived with 100 men from Virginia. Now we began to ſtrengthen and had ſkirmiſhes with the Indians almoſt every day.</p>
            <p>The ſavages now learned the ſuperiority of the LONG KNIFE, as they call the Virginians; being out-generaled in almoſt every battle. Our affairs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to wear a new aſpect; the enemy did not now venture open war, but practiſed ſecret miſchief.</p>
            <p>January 1, 1778. I went with thirty men to the Blue Licks on Licking River, to make ſalt for the different garriſons.</p>
            <p>February 7th. Hunting by myſelf to procure meat for the company, I met a party of 102 Indians, and two Frenchmen marching againſt Boonſborough. They purſued and took me; and the next day I capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulated for my men, knowing they could not eſcape. They were 27 in number, three having gone home with ſalt. The Indians according to the capitulation uſed us generouſly. They carried us to Old Cheli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cothe, the principal Indian town on Little Miami.</p>
            <p>On the 18th of February we arrived there, after an uncomfortable journey in very ſevere weather.</p>
            <p>On the 10th of March I and ten of my men were conducted to Detroit.</p>
            <p>On the 30th we arrived there, and were treated by
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:019514_0008_0FABF5BD6C0FF7E0"/>
Governor Hamilton, the Britiſh commander at the poſt, with great humanity.</p>
            <p>The Indians had ſuch an affection for me, that they refuſed 100l. ſterling offered them by the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, if they would leave me with the others, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that he might ſend me home on parole. Several Engliſh gentlemen there, ſenſible of my adverſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and touched with ſympathy, generouſly offered to ſupply my wants, which I declined with many thanks, adding that I never expected it would be it my power to recompence ſuch unmerited generosity. The Indians left my men in captivity with the Britiſh at Detroit.</p>
            <p>On the 10th of April they brought me towards Old Chelicothe, where we arrived on the twenty-fifth day of the ſame month. This was a long and very fatiguing march, through an exceeding fertile country, remarkable for fine ſprings and ſtreams of water. At Chelicothe I ſpent my time as comfortably as I could expect; was adopted according to their cuſtom, into a family, where I became a ſon, and had a great ſhare in the affection of my new parents, brothers, ſiſters, and friends. I was exceedingly familiar and eaſy with them, always appearing as chearful and ſatisfied as poſſible and they put great confidence in me. I often went a hunting with them, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently gained their applauſe for my activity at our ſhooting matches.</p>
            <p>I was careful not to exceed many of them in ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for no people are more envious than they in this ſport. I could obſerve in their countenances and geſtures the greateſt expreſſions of joy when they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded me, and, when the reverſe happened of envy. The Shawneſe king took great notice of me, and treated me with profound reſpect, and entire friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, often entruſting me to hunt at my liberty. I frequently returned with the ſpoils of the woods, and as often preſented ſome of what I had taken to him, expreſſive of my duty to my ſovereign. My food and lodging was, in common with them, not ſo good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:019514_0009_0FABF5C6AE44C5B8"/>
as I could deſire, but neceſſity made every thing acceptable.</p>
            <p>I now began to meditate an eſcape, but carefully avoided giving ſuſpicion.</p>
            <p>Until the firſt day of June, I continued at old Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licothe, and was then taken to the ſalt ſprings on Sciotha, and kept there ten days making ſalt. Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this time I hunted with them, and found the land, for a great extent about this river, to exceed the ſoil of Kentucke if poſſible, and remarkably well watered.</p>
            <p>On my return to Chelicothe 450 of the choiceſt Indian warriors were ready to march againſt Boonſbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, painted and armed in a fearful manner. This alarmed me and I determined to eſcape.</p>
            <p>On the 16th of June before ſunriſe, I went off ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly, and reached Boonſborough on the 20th, a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of 160 miles during which I had only one meal, I found our fortreſs in a bad ſtate, but we immediately repaired our flanks, gates, poſterns, and formed dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble baſtions, which we completed in ten days. One of my fellow priſoners eſcaping after me, brought ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that on account of my flight, the Indians had put off their expedition for three weeks.</p>
            <p>About Auguſt 1ſt I ſet out with 19 men to ſurpriſe Point Creek Town on Sciotha. Within four miles we fell in with 40 Indians going againſt Boonſborough. We fought and the enemy gave way, we ſuffered no loſs. The enemy had one killed and two wounded. We took three horſes and all their baggage. The Indians having evacuated their town and gone altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt Boonſborough we returned paſſed them on the ſixth day, and on the ſeventh arrived ſafe at Boonſborough.</p>
            <p>On the 8th the Indian army 444 in number, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Capt. Duqueſne and eleven other French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and their own chiefs, came and ſummoned the fort. I requeſted two days conſideration which was granted. During this we brought in through the poſterns all the horſes and other cattle we could col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:019514_0010_0FABF5CC66BB5FF0"/>On the 9th in the evening, I informed their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, that we were determined to defend the fort while a man was living. They then propoſed a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſaid if we ſent out nine men to ratify it, they would withdraw. The treaty was held within ſixty yards of the fort, as we ſuſpected the ſavages. The articles were agreed to and ſigned; when the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans told us, it was their cuſtom for two Indians to ſhake hands with every white man in the treaty as an evidence of friendſhip. We agreed to this alſo. They immediately grappled us to take us priſoners, but we cleared ourſelves of them, though ſurrounded by hundreds and gained the fort ſafe, except one that was wounded by a heavy fire from their army. On this they began to undermine the fort, beginning at the water mark of Kentucke river, which is 60 yards from the fort. We diſcovered this by the water being made muddy by the clay, and countermined them by cutting a trench acroſs their ſubterranean paſſage. The enemy diſcovering this by the clay we threw out of the fort, deſiſted.</p>
            <p>On the 20th of Auguſt they raiſed the ſiege.</p>
            <p>During this dreadful ſiege, we had two men killed, and four wounded. We loſt a number of cattle. We killed 37 of the enemy, and wounded a great number. We picked up 125 lb. of their bullets, beſides what ſtuck in the logs of the fort.</p>
            <p>Soon after this I went into the ſettlement, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worthy of notice paſſed for ſome time.</p>
            <p>In July 1779, during my abſence, Col. Bowman with 160 men, went againſt the Shawneſe of Old Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licothe. He arrived undiſcovered, a battle enſued, which laſted until ten in the morning, when Colonel Bowman retreated 30 miles. The Indians collected all their ſtrength and purſued him, when another en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement enſued for two hours, not to Col. Bowman's advantage. Col. Harrod propoſed to mount a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of horſe and brake the enemy's line; who at this time fought with remarkable fury. This deſperate meaſure had a happy effect, and the ſavages fled on
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:019514_0011_0FABF5CC7138E038"/>
all ſides. In theſe two battles we had nine men kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and one wounded. Enemy's loſs uncertain, only two ſcalps being taken.</p>
            <p>June 22d 1780, 600 Indians and Canadians under Col. Bird, attacked Riddles and Martain's ſtation, and the Forks of Licking River with ſix pieces of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery; they took all the inhabitants captives, and killed one man and two women, loaded the others with the heavy baggage, and ſuch as failed in the journey were tomahawked.</p>
            <p>The hoſtile diſpoſition of the ſavages cauſed Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Clark, the commandant at the falls of Ohio, to march with his regiment and the armed force of the country againſt Peccaway, the principal town of the Shawaneſe, on a brach of the Great Niami, which he finiſhed with great ſucceſs took ſeventeen ſcalps, and burned the town to aſhes, with the loſs of ſeventeen men.</p>
            <p>About this time I returned to Kentucke with my family; for during my captivity, my wife, thinking me killed by the Indians, had tranſported my family and goods on horſes through the wilderneſs, amidſt many dangers to her father;s houſe in North-Carolina. The Hiſtory of my difficulties in going and returning is too long to be inſerted here.</p>
            <p>On the 6th of October 1780, ſoon after my ſettling again at Boonſborough, I went with my brother to the Blue Licks and on our return he was ſhot by a party of Indians, they followed me by ſcent of a dog, which I ſhot and eſcaped.</p>
            <p>The ſeverity of the winter cauſed great diſtreſs in Kentucke the enemy during the ſummer having deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed moſt of the corn. The inhabitants lived chiefly on Buffaloe's fleſh.</p>
            <p>In ſpring 1782, the Indians harraſſed us.</p>
            <p>In May they killed one at Aſhton's ſtation, and took a Negro. Capt. Aſhton purſued them with 25 men, and in an engagement which laſted two hours, his party were obliged to retreat, having 8 killed, 4 mortally wounded; their brave commander fell in this action.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:019514_0012_0FABF5CDCFD74470"/>Auguſt 10th, two boys were carried off from Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor Hoy's ſtation, Captain Holder purſued with 17 men, they were alſo defeated, and loſt 4 and 1 wounded.</p>
            <p>Our affairs became more and more alarming. The ſavages infeſted the country, killing men at every op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity.</p>
            <p>In a field near Lexington, an Indian ſhot a man, and running to ſcalp him, was himſelf ſhot from the fort and fell dead upon his enemy.</p>
            <p>All the indian nations were now united againſt us.</p>
            <p>Auguſt 15th<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> five hundred Indians and Canadians came againſt Briat's ſtation 5 miles from Lexington, they aſſaulted the fort, killed all the cattle round it; but being repulſed they retired the third day, having about 30 killed their wounded uncertain. The garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon had 4 killed and 3 wounded.</p>
            <p>Auguſt 18th, Col. Todd, Col. Trigg, Major Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and myſelf, ſpeedily collected one hundred and ſeventy-ſix men well armed and purſued the ſavages. They had marchad beyond the Blue Licks to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable bend of the main fork of Licking River, about 43 miles from Lexington, where we overtook them on the 19th.</p>
            <p>The ſavages obſerving us, gave way, and we, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of their numbers, paſſed the river. When they ſaw our proceedings having greatly the advantage in ſituation, they formed their line of battle from one end of the Licking to the other, aboat a mile from the Blue Licks. The battle was exceeding fierce for about 15 minutes, when we being overpowered by numbers, were obliged to retreat, with the loſs of 67 men 7 of whom were taken priſoners. The brave and much lamented Colonels Todd and Trigg, Major Harland and my ſecond ſon, were among the dead. We were afterwards told that the Indians, on numbering their dead, finding they had four more killed than we, four of our people they had taken, were given up to their young warriors, to be put to death after their barbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manner.</p>
            <p>On our retreat we were met by Col. Logan, who
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:019514_0013_0FABF5CDF83C9758"/>
was haſtening to join us, with a number of well arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men. This powerful aſſiſtance we wanted on the day of battle. The enemy ſaid one more fire from us would have made them give way.</p>
            <p>I cannot reflect upon this dreadful ſcene, but ſorrow fills my heart. A zeal for the defence of their country led theſe heroes to the ſcene of action, though with a few men to attack a powerful army of experienced warriors. When we gave way, they purſued us with the utmoſt eagerneſs, and in every quarter ſpread de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. The river was difficult to croſs, and many were killed in the flight, ſome juſt entering the river, ſome in the water, others after croſſing in aſcending the cliffs. Some eſcaped on horſeback, a few on foot; and being diſperſed every where in a few hours, brought the melancholy news of this unfortunate bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to Lexington. Many widows were now made. The reader may gueſs what ſorrow filled the hearts of the inhabitants, exceeding any thing I am able to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe. Being reinforced, we returned to bury the dead, and found their bodies ſtrewed every where, cut and mangled in a dreadful manner. This mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſcene exhibited a horror almoſt unparalled; ſome torn and eaten by wild beaſts; thoſe in the river eaten by fiſhes; all in ſuch a putrid condition that no one could be diſtinguiſhed from another.</p>
            <p>When General Clark at the Falls of Ohio, heard of our diſaſter, he ordered an expedition to purſue the ſavages, we overtook them within two miles of their towns, and we ſhould have obtained a great victory, had not ſome of them met us when about two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred poles from their camp. The ſavages fled in the utmoſt diſorder, and evacuated all their towns. We burned to aſhes Old Chelicothe, Peccaway, New Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licothe, Wills Town, and Chelicothe; entirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed their corn and other fruits; and ſpread deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation through their country. We took 7 priſoners, and 5 ſcalps, and loſt only 4 men, 2 of whom were accidentally killed by ourſelves.</p>
            <p>This campaign damped the enemy, yet they made ſecret incurſions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:019514_0014_0FABF5CEB8FE31D8"/>In October a party attacked Crap Orchard, and one of them being a good way before the others, boldly entered a houſe, in which were only a woman and her children and a negro man. The ſavage uſed no vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, but attempted to carry off the negro, who hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily proved too ſtrong for him, and threw him on the ground, and in the ſtruggle the woman cut of his head with an axe—whilſt her little daughter ſhut the door. The ſavages inſtantly came up and applied their tomahawks to the door, when the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther putting an old ruſty gun barrel through a crevice, the ſavages immediately went off.</p>
            <p>From that time until the happy return of peace between the United States and Great Britain, the Indians did us no miſchief.</p>
            <p>Soon after this the Indians deſired peace.</p>
            <p>Two darling ſons, and a brother I have loſt by ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage hands, which have alſo taken from me 40 valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able horſes and abundance of cattle. Many dark and ſleepleſs nights have I ſpent, ſeparated from the cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſociety of men, ſcorched by the ſummer's ſun, and pinched by the winter's cold, an inſtrument ordained to ſettle the wilderneſs.— But now the ſcene is chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Peace crowns the ſylvan ſhade.</p>

            <head>A <hi>NARRATIVE</hi> of the Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and Eſcape of Mrs. <hi>Francis Scott,</hi> an Inhabitant of Waſhington County, Virginia.</head>
            <p>ON Wedneſday the 29th day of June, 1785, late in the evening, a large company of armed men paſſed the houſe, on their way to Kentucky; ſome part of whom en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped within two miles. Mr. Scott living on a frontier part, generally made the family watchful; but on this calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous day, after ſo large a body of men had paſſed, ſhortly after night, he lay down in his bed, and imprudently left one of the doors of his houſe open; the children were alſo in bed, and aſleep. Mrs. Scott was nearly undreſſed, when, to her unutterable aſtoniſhment and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, ſhe ſaw ruſhing in through the door that was leſt open, painted ſavages with preſented arms, raiſing a hideous ſhriek —Mr. Scott being awake, inſtantly jumped out of his bed, but was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately fired at: he forced his way thro' the middle of the enemy and got out of the door, but fell a few paces from thence. An Indian ſeized Mrs. Scott,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:019514_0016_0FABF5D02FDA0000"/>
and ordered her to a particular ſpot and not to move; others ſtabbed and cut the throats of the three youngeſt chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in their bed, and afterwards lifted them up and daſhed them down on the floor, near the mother; the oldeſt, a beautiful girl of eight years old, awoke and eſcaped out of the bed, and ran to her parent, and, with the moſt plaintive accents, cried, "O mama! mama! ſave me"—the mother, in the deepeſt anguiſh of ſpirit, and with a flood of tears, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated the ſavages to ſpare her child; but, with a brutal fierceneſs, they to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mahawked and ſtabbed her in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's arms. Adjacent to Mr. Scott's dwelling houſe, another family lived, of the name of Ball. The Indians alſo at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked them at the ſame inſtant they did Mr. Scott's; but the door being ſhut, the enemy fired into the houſe through an opening between two logs, and kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a young lad, and then eſſayed to force the door open; but a ſurviving brother fired through the door, and the enemy deſiſted, and went off; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining part of the family ran out of the houſe and eſcaped. In Mr. Scott's houſe were four good rifles well loaded,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:019514_0017_0FABF5D1185CB1C0"/>
and a good deal of cloathing and furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, part of which belonged to people that had left it on their way to Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tucky. The Indians loaded themſelves with the plunder, being 13 in number, then ſpeedily made off, and continued travelling all night; next morning their chief allotted to each man his ſhare, and detached nine of the party to ſteal horſes from the inhabitants on Clinch.—</p>
            <p>The eleventh day after Mrs. Scott's captivity, the four Indians that had her in charge ſtopped at a place of rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, and to hunt, being now in great want of proviſions. Three went out, and the chief, being an old man, was left to take care of the priſoner, who, by this time, expreſſed a willingneſs to proceed to the Indian towns, which ſeemed to have the deſired effect of leſſening her keeper's vigilance. In the day time, as the old man was grain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a deer-ſkin, the captive, pondering on her ſituation, and anxiouſly looking for an opportunity to make her eſcape, took the reſolution, and going to the Indian careleſsly, aſked liberty to go a ſmall diſtance to a ſtream of water, to waſh the blood off her apron, that had
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:019514_0018_0FABF5D1B83484F0"/>
remained beſmeared ſince the fatal night of the murder of her little daughter. He ſaid to her in the Engliſh tongue, "go along;" ſhe then paſſed by him, his face being in a contrary direction from that ſhe was going, and he very buſy. She, after getting to the water, proceeded on without delay, made to a high barren mountain, and travelled until late in the evening, when ſhe came down to the valley, in ſearch of the track ſhe had been taken along; hoping thereby to find the way back, without the riſk of being loſt, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing with hunger in uninhabited parts. On coming acroſs the valley to the river ſide, ſuppoſed to be the eaſterly branch of Kentucky river, ſhe obſerved in the ſand, tracks of two men, that had gone up the river, and had juſt returned.— She concluded theſe to have been her purſuers, which excited emotions of gratitude and thankfulneſs to divine providence for ſo timeous a deliverance. Being without any proviſions, having no kind of weapon or tool to aſſiſt her in getting any, and being almoſt deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of cloathing, alſo knowing that a vaſt tract of rugged high mountains in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervened,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:019514_0019_0FABF5D26E3B6F18"/>
between where ſhe was and the inhabitants eaſtwardly, and that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Kentucky ſettlements un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, and ſhe almoſt as ignorant as a child of the method of ſteering through the woods, excited painful ſenſations.— But certain death, either by hunger or wild beaſts, ſeemed preferable rather than to be in the power of beings who had excited in her mind ſuch horrour. She addreſſed heaven for protection, and taking courage, proceeded onward. After travelling three days, ſhe had nearly met with the Indians, as ſhe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that had been ſent to Clinch to ſteal horſes, but providentially hearing their approach, concealed herſelf among the cane, until the enemy had paſſed. This giving a freſh alarm, and her mind being filled with conſternation, ſhe got loſt, proceeding backwards and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards for ſeveral days: at length ſhe came to a river, that ſeemed to come from the eaſt; concluding it was Sandy river, ſhe accordingly reſolved to trace it to its ſource, which is adjacent to the Clinch ſettlement. After proceeding up the ſame ſeveral days, ſhe came to where the river runs through the great
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:019514_0020_0FABF5D333EBD6F0"/>
Laural mountain, where is a prodigious water-fall, and numerous high craggy clifts along the water edge; that way ſeemed impaſſable, the mountain ſteep and difficult: However, our mournful traveller concluded that the latter way was the beſt. She therefore aſcended for ſome time, but coming to a range of inacceſſible rocks, ſhe turned her courſe towards the foot of the mountain and the river ſide; after getting into a deep gulley, and paſſing over ſeveral high ſteep rocks, ſhe reached the river ſide, where, to her inexpreſſible affliction, ſhe found that a perpendicular rocks, or rather one that hung over, of 15 or 20 feet high, formed the bank. Here a ſolemn pauſe took place; ſhe eſſayed to return, but the height of the ſteep rocks ſhe had deſcended over, prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her. She then returned to the edge of the precipice, and viewed the bottom of it, as the certain ſpot to end all her troubles, or remain on the top to pine away with hunger, or be devoured by wild beaſts. After ſerious meditation, and devout exerciſes, ſhe determined on leaping from the height, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly jumped off. Although the place ſhe
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:019514_0021_0FABF5D44D3F7EA8"/>
had to alight on, was covered with uneven rocks, not a bone was broken; but, being exceedingly ſtunned with the fall, ſhe remained unable to proceed for ſome ſpace of time.</p>
            <p>The dry ſeaſon cauſed the river to be ſhallow—ſhe travelled in it, where ſhe could, by its edge, until ſhe got through the mountain, which ſhe concluded was ſeveral miles. After this, as ſhe was travelling along the bank of the river, a venomous ſnake bit her on the ankle: ſhe had ſtrength to kill it, and knowing its kind, concluded that death muſt ſoon overtake her. By this time Mrs. Scott was reduced to a mere ſkeleton, with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue, hunger and grief; probably this ſtate of her body was the means of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving her from the effects of the poiſon; be that as it may, ſo it was, that very little pain ſucceeded the bite, and what little ſwelling there was, fell into her feet. Our wanderer now left the river, and, after proceeding a good diſtance, ſhe came to where the valley parted into two, each leading a different courſe.</p>
            <p>Here a painful ſuſpence again took place; a ſorlorn creature, almoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, and certain, if ſhe was far led
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:019514_0022_0FABF5EDD7401278"/>
out of the way, ſhe would never ſee a human creature. During this ſolilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quy, a beautiful bird paſſed cloſe by her, fluttering along the ground, and went out of ſight up one of the vallies. This drew her attention, and whilſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering what it might mean, another bird, of the ſame appearance, in like manner fluttered paſt her, and took the ſame valley the other had done. This determined her choice of the way; and, in two days, which was on the 11th day of Auguſt, ſhe reached that ſettlement on Clinch, called New-Garden: whereas (ſhe has ſince been informed by woods<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) had ſhe taken the other valley, it would have led her back towards the Ohio. Mrs. Scott relates, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians told her, that the party was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of four different nations, two of whom ſhe thinks they named Delawares and Mingoes.</p>
