            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE following lines were written at firſt for the ſatiſfaction of my own mind, as I take a peculiar pleaſure in writing upon divine ſubjects. And though it is very contrary to my natural inclination to let any of my writings be publiſhed, yet ſince the <hi>Lord</hi> in his mercy has (as I hope) look me as a brand from the burning, and ſhewed me the danger of the way, of ſin, and alſo ſhewed me the way of peace: And ſince he has made me deſire with my whole ſoul to ſpend my life in his ſervice, and to ſpare no pains in ſeeking the welfare and everlaſting happineſs of my fellow-creatures, whoſe ſouls are as precious and need ſalvation as much as mine. And ſince the preſent time is very ſhort, and a long eternity will ſoon ſucceed, where our ſouls ſhall be forever fixed in keen deſpair and the moſt bitter anguiſh, or in the perfection of complete happineſs; the conſideration of theſe things make me willing this weak perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance ſhould be printed, hoping the <hi>LORD</hi>, who is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſhew his wiſdom in folly, and his ſtrength in weakneſs, will bleſs it for the good of ſome ſouls. To whoſe rich bleſſing I deſire to recommend theſe lines, and all who read or bear them. Written by one who is under great obligations to ſpend her whole life in the ſervice of the <hi>KING</hi> of <hi>GLORY</hi>.</p>

            <head>A DIALOGUE, &amp;c</head>
            <p>
               <hi>Believer.</hi> O HOW I admire the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful love and free grace of God; he hath pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me as a brand from the burning. Why am I not now in the torments of hell? There I was going with haſte, and there I ſhould ſoon arrived had not the Lord prevented. He hath took up out of an horrible pit and miry clay, and hath ſet me upon the rock and eſtabliſhed my goings, and put a new ſong in my mouth, even praiſe to God. Come taſte and ſee how good the Lord is; come feel the virtue of the Saviour's merits. I ſee I have obtained joy by his ſorrow, and life by his death. And now he feeds my ſoul with ſatiſfying and refreshing dainties: and I have liberty to invite you to come and feaſt alſo; for here is a full ſtore opened for whoſoever will.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Come ſinner then, O come and taſte</l>
               <l>Of this reviving goſpel ſeaſt!</l>
               <l>If once your ſoul begins to feed,</l>
               <l>You'll ſay 'tis heavenly meat indeed.</l>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Unbeliever.</hi> I have no reliſh for ſuch diſcourſe as this, and I can take no delight in your company if this muſt be your theme. And as for the fealt you invite me to taſte of, you may enjoy it to yourſelf without me, for I have no deſire to taſte thereof. If I can have enough of this world, I deſire no more.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:024792_0004_0FC890B0DF247538"/>
               <hi>Believer.</hi> Though you ſlight my diſcourſe and company, yet let me try to convince you of your dangerous, unhappy ſtate.—You are in bondage to the ſame cruel maſter I once ſerved, who kept me always to work, to provide fuel for my own burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and treaſure up wrath (for myſelf) againſt the day of wrath. I fed upon aſhes and drank in ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity like water; and death, eternal death was to be my wages—yet I was ſo bewitched and deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through the deceitfulneſs of ſin, I was ſtupid in the ſlavery of this hard maſter, and ſhould been ſoon led by him to eternal miſery, had not a lovely Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtronger than he, came and ſet my ſoul at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. He drew me with the cords of love and I ran after him. He ſhewed me his beauty and my ſoul was raviſhed therewith; and now through grace I have got a new Maſter, whom I determine to ſerve. And for his dear ſake I am heartily willing to bid a final adieu to all the ſinful pleaſures of this world. And ſince I have found the way of peace, I want to have you find it too that we may walk together to the bliſful manſions my glorious Deliverer has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for all who are willing to leave their bondage, chains, and fetters, and walk at liberty in the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant way of peace.—Great peace have they that love him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Unbeliever.</hi> You tell of a new Maſter, but I can ſee no goodneſs in him, nor' any pleaſure in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. I intend to ſerve my old maſter for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. Though you ſay that death is to be his wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, vet death appears to be a great way off from me, and I muſt provide for life now, and think of death when it is more near. I hope it will all be well at laſt, I ſee no preſent danger.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:024792_0005_0FC890B2D9D59238"/>
               <hi>Believer.</hi> O that you could ſee one glimpſe of thy Lord and Maſter whom I now ſerve! You would ſoon cry out with wonder, how great is his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! How great his beauty! And if you had once entered into his ſweet ſrvice, you would find ſuch pleaſure therein, that you would rejoice to ſpend and be ſpent for him and his dear children. You think that death is a great way off from you, but if you ſee your caſe as it is, you would ſee that you are now in ſtate of death: To be carnally minded is death; and ſince you are under the power of a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal mind, you are alſo under the power of death. Your ſoul is now dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, and you are condemned and continually expoſed to have natural death, ſeize upon your ſoul, and ſhut it up in keen deſpair, beyond the reach of any help or hope forever; and yet you are ſo ſtupid as to ſee no preſent danger. Who can forbear lamenting to ſee how active, rational creatures, are led on in darkneſs and blindneſs to everlaſting ruin and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Unbeliever.</hi> What you tell about my being in a ſtate of death, and the like, ſound to me like idle tales and vain fancies. I have often heard ſuch ſtories, and ſometimes I have been afraid they were true, and I feated I was in danger of enduring e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal miſery: But ſince I have got rid of theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing fears. I can go on very eaſy, and the more I hear of theſe things the leſs effect they take upon my mind, therefore pray let me alone, for I reſolve to take pleaſure I can in this world, let what will come hereafter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:024792_0006_0FC9997637B40668"/>
               <hi>Believer.</hi> If this is is your caſe, O how ſad it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed If this is the language of your heart, let this corrupt language be like thunder to awaken you up. Remember that ſolemn word in Prov. xxix. <hi>He that being often reproved, hardeneth his neck, ſhall ſuddenly be deſtroyed and that without remedy</hi>. You have been often reproved, and hitherto it ſeems you have hardened your neck, and who knows but ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den deſtruction is juſt ready to ſeize upon you, and caſt you into that doleful furnace, <hi>where their worm di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="4 letters">

                  </gap> not, and the fire is not quenched?</hi> But if terror willl not drive you, O that love and mercy might draw yon to Jeſus Chriſt. I have not a word to ſay againſt your taking all the pleaſure you can in this world, but I can tell you there is nothing worthy of the name of pleaſure to be found in all the ways of ſin. If you deſire pleaſure, come suck it where it is to be found. Come taſte of the love of Jeſus; enter into his ſervice, and devote yourſelf wholly to him, and then you will know what peace and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure mean. If you want riches, come to Jeſus and buy without money and without price, gold tried in the fire, that will endure the laſt conſuming fire, when the elements ſhall m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nt that will make you ſhine forth like the ſun in the kingdom of heaven; and food and drink that will ſatiſfy your hungry and thirſty ſoul, and make you fat and flouriſhing in the courts of the Lord forever. If you deſire honor, O do not took that honor that is no more enduring than the breath of mortals; but ſeek that honor that comes from God only. Conſider what an honor it
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:024792_0007_0FC9992FB7F4FF38"/>
is to be an heir of God, and joint heir with Chriſt, to be a fellow citizen with the ſaints and of the houſehold of God. What an unſpeakable honor is this while living in this world, and when death ſhall come to ſend a ſaint home to glory, what an honor it will be to be waited upon by ſhining An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and ſafely conducted to ſit down with the King of Kings in his throne, to live and reign with Chriſt. But it is beyond my power to tell what ſhall be done to the man whom the King of Glory delights to honor: He ſays, <hi>They that honor me I will honor, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> that deſpiſe me, ſhall be lightly eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed; the wiſe ſhall inherit glory, but ſhame ſhal be the promotion of fools</hi>. Will you be ſo fooliſh as to ſpend all your life in ſeeking that honor that will make you aſhamed before the whole creation, and in laying up that treaſure that will be as fire to torment you forever, and in taking that pleaſure that is like ſtupifying poiſon, to make you ſenſeleſs while you are a veſſel of wrath, fitting your ſelf for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting deſtruction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Unbeliever.</hi> This talk ſtrikes me with ſome fear; I cannot wholly ſhield it off: But I love my ſins ſo well I cannot be willing to part with them yet. It is likely I ſhall live many years, and I ſee no need of ſetting out now to be religious: If I can but be converted juſt before I die, it will do my turn as well as if I ſhould be religious all my lifetime.— When I am old it will be a very proper time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of my ſins and prepare for another world. And if I ſhould not live to be old I can be earneſt in-ſeeking after Chriſt in my laſt ſickneſs; then I'll cry day and night, and never give out until my ſoul is ſafe. So upon the whole I expect I ſhall have
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:024792_0008_0FC99930EE36F2A8"/>
peace at left, though I walk for the preſent after the imagination of my own heart.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Believer.</hi> O do not grieve away the Holy Spirit that invites you to come to day. The preſent time is all that you can call your own. It is very unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Whether you will ever ſee that future day, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you expect to repent and prepare for eternity. Who knows but the Lord will ſay, <hi>Thou feel, this night thy ſoul ſhall be required of thee</hi>. It is danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to flight and deſpiſe a good offer, with a vain hope of having the ſame offer another time; or to put off the moſt important buſineſs, which muſt be done, or you are undone forever, to old age or a ſick bed, when it is very unlikely whether you will ever be old or ſick to this world. How often does the King of Terrors ſuddenly ſeize upon thoſe who are careleſs and ſecure, and ſend them to their long homes as in a moment. But if you ſhould be ſick ever ſo long, or live to be ever ſo old, who can prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſe you the ſalvation that you now refuſe: Then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the Lord will withhold his ſpirit that you now grieve, and ſay it ſhall no longer ſtrive with you. O how dreadful would ſuch a ſickneſs be! The body racked with diſtreſs, and the poor ſoul without any good hope, juſt ready to be forced into the flames of devouring fire, there to dwell in end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs anguiſh. If this ſhould be your unhappy caſe, doubtleſs you will look back with ſorrow and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member ſuch and ſuch a time, when you was loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly invited to come to Chriſt and obtain eternal life, but you would not. O come now and be happy! Chooſe you this day whom you will ſerve. If nothing elſe can move upon your mind, go to the houſes of mourning, and ſee what difference there is between
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:024792_0009_0FC999325FC98ED8"/>
the righteous and the wicked, between him that ſerved God and him that ſerveth him not, at their death. Go ſee a vain youth that has ſpent his life vanity; or a rich ſinner that has fared ſumptouſly every day, and took all the pleaſures that this world could afford him, when leaving all his good things behind him: In horror and anguiſh the ſoul leaves the body, and in hell he lifts his eyes being in tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, pleading for a drop of water to cool his tongue, but pleads in vain: There the poor wretch muſt remain helpleſs and hopeleſs to eternity: Go alſo and ſee a poor ſaint that has paſſed through great tribulations here: The heir of glory has got upon the laſt edge of his time, and nothing before him (after death) worſe than unſpeakable joys and pleaſures forever. He leaves all his evil things behind, and enters into peace. With joyful expectations the happy ſoul leaves the body, and is carried by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels to the manſions of glory above. There the happy ſaint will remain and enjoy all his heart's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire without any trouble to eternity. Now chooſe you which of theſe circumſtances you will be in: You know not but that this is the only time that ever you will be allowed to make your choice, to the endleſs ages of a long eternity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Unbeliever.</hi> I chooſe to die like the poor ſaint, rather than like the rich ſinner. Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my laſt end be like his. But though I deſire to die as the righteous do, yet I am not ready to live as they do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Believer.</hi> O do not flatter yourſelf with any hope of dying in peace, as the righteous do, unleſs you a live holy as they do. If you intend to go to heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en you muſt walk in tha way that leads there; which
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:024792_0010_0FC99933F8272AF8"/>
is a way of holineſs, very ſtraight and narrow, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to the broad way that it ſo pleaſing to poor fallen ſinners. Heaven will be no place for thoſe that love ſin and hate holineſs. If you could be permitted in amongſt all the ſhining hoſts above, with ſuch a diſpoſition as you now manifeſt, what is their joy, would be your torment, and you would rather the weighty mountains ſhould fall on you, than to ſee that glorious, lovely face, which all the ſaints long to behold. Without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord with delight. The gates of the glorious city above will never receive any thing that defileth, nor them that love and work iniquity. If you chooſe the faint's portion hereafter, then chooſe their portion here, which is Chriſt, in them the hope of glory, and a bleſſed portion it is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Unbeliever.</hi> If the caſe is as you repreſent it, I chooſe the way to hell, for the way to heaven is ſo contrary to my inclination, that I had rather run the venture of all that can come hereafter, than to walk therein. I eſteem the honor of my fellow-creatures worth more than the honor of my Maker. And I eſteem the joys and pleaſures of this life more high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than the never ending joys and pleaſures of the life to come. All the torments of hell you tell ſo much about, do not appear ſo dreadful to me as to live ſuch a dull, melancholy life as you do. Though the Lord tells me in his word, if I diſregard his calls, he will laugh at my calamity, and mock when my fear comes, yet I had rather run the venture of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during that, than to have my companions laugh at me for being religious. Therefore I ſhould be glad if you would let me alone, that I may go on eaſy in the broad road, let it lead where it will.</p>

               <hi>Believer.</hi> O what folly and ſtupid blindneſs ſin has brought upon rational beings, which they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover by daily practice if not in plain words. If this is your choice you muſt go on in your own way, it is beyond my power to help you. If you chooſe the ſlavery of Satan, rather than liberty, you muſt do his drudgery and receive his wages. If you think it your wiſdom to ſpend all your days in treaſuring up wrath againſt the day of wrath, and preparing fuel for your own eternal burning, you muſt forever blame yourſelf therefor. The Lord gives you ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny invitations to come to him and enjoy eternal life; but hitherto you have refuſed, and grieved his Holy Spirit and deſpiſed his Bride, by whom he ſends word to you to come. <hi>The Spirit and the Bride ſay come</hi>. Though his patience holds out to give you this one invitation to come after ſo long a time, who can tell but that if you now refuſe to accept, he will ſay you ſhall not taſte of his ſupper. Therefore if you have any love for yourſelf do not neglect the great ſalvation any longer. Though you deſire me to let you alone, yet I cannot bear to leave you yet. O that I could perſuade you to come to Jeſus and have all your wants ſupplied, and be happy in time and forever.

was, I found my miſtake. I found that word true in Iſa.xlviii.22. <hi>There is no peace ſaith the Lord un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the wicked</hi>. When I feel dull and melancholy it is for want of more true religion. We may be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and yet cheerful; ſorrowful, and yet exceeding joyful; weeping for ſin, and yet the ſoul ſinging for joy of heart. I can wiſh you no greater happineſs than to leave the ways of ſin, death and darkneſs, and to walk with pleaſure in the bright and ſhining way that leads to more bright and ſhining palaces of infading glory above. If you ſay you cannot come, ſearch your heart and ſee if it is not more proper to ſay you will come to Jeſus that you might have life, than that you had rather go on in ſin a little longer. Why can't you now reſolve to ſeek the Lord, and ſpend each breath in your life, earneſtly begging the Lord would take you out of the horrible pit and the miry clay, into which you are daily ſinking deeper and deeper. And who can tell but that he who hears the ravens and young lions when they cry, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

            <p>
               <hi>Unbeliever.</hi> Theſe things ſtrike my mind a little; but I muſt wait a while to ſee whether you hold out in this way before I give much heed to your talk. I have known many that in time paſt were all for religion, crying out againſt ſin, and inviting me and others to come to Chriſt; recommending his ways, ſaying they took more comfort in one hour than they did in all their life before; but now they tell me no ſuch thing, their exhortations are all ended; and many have turned to their old way again, which makes me think there is no ſuch pleaſure in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:024792_0013_0FC9998C9B22FDB0"/>
nor no ſuch danger in ſin as they pretended. I keep a very ſtrict watch over thoſe who have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed to be Chriſtians, and if I ſee them commit a little ſin, it makes me feel very eaſy, though I ſhould commit a greater one; for it cannot be expected that thoſe who never made profeſſion ſhould be as ſtrict as thoſe that have. If I am in company with any of them, if they appear with a ſolemn countenance, it
gives me a gentle reproof; if they give me warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by words, I feel a ſting in my conſcience, though I ſometimes ſhake it off with laughter and ſcorn; but if they join with me in my fooliſh talking and jeſting, or in any thing contrary to the profeſſion of godlineſs, that pleaſes me well, and gives me more liberty to go on in ſin, and takes of all the weight of their former warnings and exhortations, or the warning of others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Believer.</hi> I acknowledge that ſome fell out by the way, not enduring to the end; but this may prove to you the truth of the ſcriptures. Chriſt tells of ſome who receive the word with joy, but not having root in themſelves (or not being rooted and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in love) they endure but a little while; in time of temptation they fall away. We are alſo informed by the ſcriptures, that the righteous ſometimes fall through infirmity, and are liable to ſin; but when the righteous fail they ſhall riſe again, and if they ſin they have an advocate with the Father. But what good will their fall do you? The word of God ſtands againſt you, and that ſhall ſtand though all creatures ſhould fall. Therefore pray regard that ſure word, and if I ſpeak anything contrary to that, regard it not; but what I ſay agreeable to that, is worthy of your notice, whether I ſtand or fall.
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:024792_0014_0FC999B831CA8178"/>
Every one of us ſhall give an account of himſelf to God. We ſhall all be judged according to our works. Thoſe who eat the ſin of God's people will find it to bitterneſs in the end. While you are waiting to ſee whether I ſtand or fall, perhaps you fall into the bottomleſs pit, from whence you can never riſe. Why will you be glad to find a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling block, to ſtumble over, into the flames of hell? If you ſhould ſee a perſon fall into the mire, it would be your wiſdom so take warning thereby, and eſcape that evil: But inſtead of that you take exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by the fall of others to He down and wallow in the miry pit of ſin. If thou art wiſe, thou art wiſe for thyſelf; but if thou ſcorneſt, thou alone muſt bear it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Unbeliever.</hi> There is one excuſe more that I can make, and that is, my inability to help myſelf. This Shields off conviction, and makes me eaſy to go on ſin; for I think that if I ſhould try ever ſo much I could not convert myſelf, and ſo I do not ſee but that I had as good be content, and take my liberty to do whatſoever is right in my own eyes as any way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Believer.</hi> This is an argument of ſatan's deviſing. O do not give heed to this, and take the advice of your worſt enemy, who ſeeks your ruin, rather than to hearken to the good counſel of Chriſt, who is the only friend that can ſave your ſoul. The light that is come into the world by the great Redeemer, ſhines to the very place where you are, and you will be condemned if you ſhut your eyes againſt it, and you muſt blame yourſelf for your condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The call of Chriſt comes to your rational mind, and you freely accept thereof, or elſe refuſe it. The Lord calls, but you will not hear: He
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:024792_0015_0FC999E37B1E0498"/>
