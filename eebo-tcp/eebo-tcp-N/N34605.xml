            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

candidly aver that many thousand Britains, particularly Scots, and especially my countrymen the brave High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers, would, with me, have wasted their strength, exhausted their blood, and chearfully died, sword in hand; under the command of that ever meritorious General, Sir Guy Carleton Had the ministry been in the field, to experience the troubles and dangers, you encountred and surmounted, you never had been superceded: unhappy for our national cause: that you retired from command, since which period, we have it to lament, that the British interest seems to be too much absorded in indolence and inactivity. As you Sir, best know of any man alive, the alacrity and perseverance, with which I always contributed my poor but best ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and finally lost my all in the British cause, I could not appeal to any other person, equally enabled, to do my loyal behaviour common justice; and I'm con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced more heartily disposed to give a humane recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of me, to my good King and country, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving the many calamities I did and do suffer in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with some other loyal American refugees, who have not been rewarded according to merit.</p>

            <p>IT is for national use, and information to the public that John M'Alpine author of the following de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tails, has now published to the world, these genuine and brief narratives and memoirs of some of his particular adventures, and interesting manoeuvers, from the time of his first settlement, in America, anno 1773: and during the long and hazardous period, that he loyally and faithfully attached himself avowedly to the British Army's in that country, where his repeated good of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and attendance were often sollicited and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by several commanding officers and others, tho' his best services have been so perfectly neglected.— Containing the various narratives, and curious details of his making family settlements, in the province of New-York, America: His repeated expulsions from different estates by the American revolters; The hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships he underwent: Dangers he encountered; dissas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters he contended with: Difficulties he surmounted: Escapes he effected: Losses he sustained; Cruel treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that he and his family endured: Various hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous good offices that he occasionly undertook for his Country, &amp; seasonably &amp; happily performed in the roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al cause; particularly his essential services and military exploits, while he was confidentialy employed by, and faithfully continued with the British Army's, under the General Carleton, Burgoyne, Hamilton, Phillips, Powell, and other officers: and his readily acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed valliant behaviour in the attack and engagement, at-Freemans's Farms in Seeptember 1777, where the Rebels were defeated.

and supported him: The great injury's done him in his then line of employment, both at New York and Long Island, by sundry persons named, who should rather have protected and encouraged him; Particularly the unremitting oppression he endured from Lieutenant Colonel Clark, Barrack Master General, and his rapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious assistants in that department; and especially his avaritious deputy Gilbert Wauch, formerly baker in Edinburgh; the calamitous hardships and loses he long suffered by their oppressive exertions; and his lawless and forceable expulsion from his land and property on Loyd's neck Long Island, through their perfidious misrepresen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and irregular efforts: and his many peaceable, tho' ineffectual applications, to those in highest rank at New York, for obtaining redress. And now he proposes to lay his unparalelled grievances, and deplorable situation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Throne of our most Gracious Sovereign, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, all good Patriots, and men of humanity, and in general before the Nation and World at large.

            <head>GENUINE NARATIVES, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IN the month of May 1773, I John M'Alpine, author of these narratives, left Scotland with a view to set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in America, and in June thereafter arrived with my family and effects at New York; where having remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a short time with a special friend, I was by him recommended to Colonel Reid as the most proper per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to take or purchase uncultivated land, of which kind he had considerable lots, in the back <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ettlements of New York Province. Accordingly a bargain was compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by my purchasing six hundred acres of uncultivated land from him at the rate of Ten Shillings currency per acre, the value payable in the course of Seven Years. In consequence of that agreement, I moved up the country, and settled upon Colonel Reid's estate, where I had not been above eight days, resident when a party of the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditti (called Green Mountain Boys) came from Hampshire in New England, and dispossessed me and my family; burning the houses, miln, cropt, utensils &amp;c. on pretence that, that particular tract of ground was not within the limits of Colonel Reid's grant.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding this violent assault in my outset, I took every possible way and method in my power, of continuing (tho' inconveniently) on the premisses, that season, in the flattering hope of being allowed to retain quiet possession, till once the humour of these infatuated people (now growing outragious) would sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the dictates of cool reason<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that I would have time and opportunity to cultivate more acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, perhaps intimacy with them. But matters grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing daily more critical with these turbulent neighbours, I despaired of enjoying any peaceable or comfortable
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:045285_0005_101FE2A29BEA0AB8"/>
possession on that tract of ground; and therefore I came to the resolution of removing that fall to a more distant situation. This I accordingly perfected, and took up my winter residence in the month of November follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (1773) upon the tract or lot of land, that belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Major Allan Campbell, near to Crownpoint. Here I industriously persevered in improving the ground, and got about fifty acres of it cultivated to advantage; having reduced that eligible spot from a barren wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, covered with wood into a valuable little Farm, where by dint of attention and perseverance, I lived very comfortably for about thirty months; having suited myself with necessary houses, and other requisite accommodations. In this sweet repose, I spent my time agreably with my family and servants, prosecuting further improvements; when I was of a new interrupted in the month of May 1776, by a party of thirty arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med American stragglers (under command of a nominal Captain or leader) who rushed impetuously into my grounds, where I was at work with my servant men, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring the fields; and calling us villians, robbers and interlopping Tory's, ordered us to surrender; and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing struck me with some severity, instantly made me prisoner, without giving any reason for this assault, dragging us along in this violent manner, we were tos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed promiscuously into an open boat, upon the Lake, hard by; and there confined under a Guard; until that party had assaulted and taken Crownpoint (a British Fort) at four miles distant from my settlement.</p>
            <p>This event happened soon after the enemy had taken possession of Ticonderoga; and then only it was that I got intimation that the rebellious Americans had revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from their allegiance to Great Br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I had not continued in quiet and contentment at home about two weeks, when a riotious mob of neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring settlers upon the New England grants, tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuously assembling, again attacked and made me prisoner; seizing and carrying away all my arms and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, except a small parcel that I found means to conceal without, among the woods<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and carrying me along in a very rough manner, under an armed guard delivered me up, a captive to a Captain Barns, at Crown point (who then commanded there,) declaring me to be a most obnoxious dangerous person, and a professed enemy to the American United States, who should not have any liberty among them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Under the load of these accusations, I was here kept close prisoner for several days; when happily my old acquaintance Colonel Hay of the American Army, came to Crown-point; and he being soon informed of the repeated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious treatment given me, and my present confinement in that Fort; compassionately pity'd my situation, gave orders for my conditional release and liberty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home and remain in quietness with my family; so long as I behaved inoffencesively towards the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can constitution and did not appear in any opposition to their cause by any personal services, information or any way whatever.</p>
            <p>I had not been many days in the enjoyment of this indulgence when I was again apprehended by another mob, similar to the former, headed by a Serjeant from Captain Barns's party at Crown-point; to which place I was again hurried away, Capt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>I was under no obligation to answer their accusations, and refused to comply with the demand made for my arms and ammunition: but being at last intreated by some friends, who fear'd my being thrown into prison, where I might possibly ly long neglected, with great reluctance I agreed to part with my fire arms, ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and favourite broad Sword; and upon this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance I was permitted to return home, once more; where I had not spent many days, when by an indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging order from the foresaid Colonel Hay, all my weap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were returned me.</p>
            <p>I remained at my habitation the rest of this season, under a great deal of anxiety and disquiet; my family being in continual hazard of depradations; My cattle frequently killed, and my effects daily plundered by American parties, incessantly straggling round the country; we having no consolation, but our hopes of the arrival and support of the British forces; which not appearing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor any notice of their motions, to our relief I, and some loyal neighbours were in agonies and despair, and gave up all for lost. The season of mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary exploits being nearly exhausted and the Winter fast approaching, I went to Ticond-rago for some supplys especially Salt: and applied by supplication to Gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Gates (then the commandent there) whose Aid-du-camp told me expressly, that if I gave testimony of my being friendly to the cause of the United American States now under agitation, I would be readily furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with Salt or any other article wanted by me: but otherwise, I could neither expect, or obtain any supplies whatsoever from them. This peremptorly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply

delivered under so strict a qualification, by no means suiting my principles or occasions. I departed silently, meaning to get home timeously that night. During my stay at Ticonderoga, that day I took the opportunity of making some enquiries and observations, that were of some use soon thereafter. There I fell into company with Gillilan and Watson (two men of some property in my neighbourhood, on Lake Champlain) who were known to be disaffected to the royal cause; we dined together, during which time some expressions escaped me, that gave them offence, on the circumstances of times; which fully convinced them of my being dutifully attached to my King and Country. They thereupon resolved and privately determined to have me secured and sent to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement. This treacherous intention of these crafty men being accidentaly made known to my acquaintance, and old friend, Mrs. Hay, (in whose house we were all then) she with her usual goodness of heart, immediately gave me the hint privately, urging my instant departure reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting our conversation, and knowing the men I had to do with, I gave peremptor complyance, to Mrs Hay's intreaties, and decamped from Ticonderoga; in a small Skiff of my own, hurrying with all possible dispatch homeward, but by contrary wind, and the length of the navigation I did not reach my own house, till the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afternoon.</p>
            <p>There, I was hardly refreshed, when a numerous scout<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Having no view of any support from our royal army, and as little prospect of my own and family's escape, from the calamaties that threatened us, on all hands; but kind providence soon removed all my gloomy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions; for, early next morning an enemy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

passed my house, going express to Ticonderoga, for a strong reinforcement of Ten thousand men, from the Americans assembled there, to the immediate support and defence of Crown point, which would be soon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested by the British troops under General Carleton, who had come by the Lakes from Canada: had already attacked and defeated the American Naval strength, upon Lake Champlain; and approach'd near Crownpoint in force. Phrantick at such an unexpected, agreeable and seasonable piece of acceptable news, I instantly took horse and rode away at full career to embrace my friends: but in place of taking my way privately, thro the woods and rough grounds as I should have prudently done, I drove on impetuously and incautiously, in high spirits along the beaten path to Crown point, and rushed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerably into the throng of the confused tumult of the people and soldiers, where I was no sooner arrived than apprehended by the giddy multitude all in uproar, with the general cry, of, sieze that damn'd rascal, the outlaw'd and notorious Torry M'calpine; at that instant I had the help of twenty men to pull and draw me from my horse, was marched along to the fort, and there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined close all day, under a strong guard of well armed men, who incessantly insulted me.</p>
            <p>During my confinement in such odious quarters, I heard it whispered that general orders had been issued to all the residenters in and about Crown-point and its en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virons, to secure their effects, drive off their cattle, and remove themselves, as all the Houses there, and round the country, were to be instantly burned.</p>
            <p>This alarming intelligence induced me in the most supplicating manner to request my enlargement, and enquire the reason, why of all the men residing in that neighbourhood, I alone should be singled out a victim for total destruction; kept in in closs confinement there, like a malifactor: and seemingly to be debarred from the benefits of common humanity, was deny'd my liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on that occasion, to provide against the threatened total destruction of my family and property, by this

            <p>Watching always for my opportunity of deserting from my guardian Sergeant and his posse, I snatched the

This crazie machine, I got launched with the help of some boys who boldly came to assist me, and who accompanied me in padling the hazardous tool for four miles, in the dark lake, till I got up with General Carleton's fleet; here I immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately went on board the Commodore, that vess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

General Carleton, being honoured with his confidential conversation, I made ample discoveries to him of all I knew, respecting the inhabitants and state of this district of the back country, that he was now got into; and the dispositions and attachments of the people immediately above Crown-point and its environs: giving especially a minute information of their state, situation and force at Ticonderoga, upon which I had made particular observations, at my being so recently there, even so late as the proceeding Friday.</p>
            <p>His Excellency was pleased to hear my detail with condescention; expressed his approbation of my remarks intelligence, and behaviour, saying audibly, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved me so loyaly attached, faithfull, and proper for purposes in speculation, that he would not on any account, want me about his person and the public service con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

proper party of such officers and men as I judged expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient: with whom I would not only scout the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious country, learn the situation of our enemys: but also might procure a sufficient supply of live cattle for victualling our army, that had perfected their journey and voyage, upon salt provisions allenarly.</p>
            <p>His excellency cautioning me of the danger and fatigue necessarily attending such manaeuvre's, and genteelly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>avouring me with his directions, he consented to my having such a party as was proper and requisite, who upon the following morning were accordingly se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected; consisting of two hundred and sixty brave fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, under the command of the gallant officers, Captain Frazer of the Rangers, and Captain Monie of the Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians; I going as confident conductor of the expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Thus we proceeded chearfully through bad roads, swamps woods and rough grounds, for the space of fifteen miles, and lay the residue of that tempestuous, rainy night, upon our arms, within a short distance of our enemy's lines, where we kept snug and undiscovered; I going close to and again among our party, which I repeated several different times, beseeching our men to kept quiet and private; and to be particularly carefull to preserve their arms and ammunition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> safe and dry from all rain and injury, as all our success, escape, and even our lives, depended on these judicious precautions: and I must do them the justice to say here, that the whole detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment paid every attention to their duty, and my earnest recommendations.—In this dreary period of our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary inactive time and considering all circumstances, the commanding officer's and I too, despaired of any great success from our journey; in fact the matter was a little alarming, as we had not been able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve one single musket in due order, nor all our am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition quite dry, through the severity of the rainy, inclement long night; at same time we lay close to the quarters of about twenty thousand enemies</p>
            <p>I indeed feared we were in a forlorn situation aed
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:045285_0009_101FE2AFD4D776E8"/>
desperate circumstances, which no doubt urged me the more to hold our people in chearful humour, and to preserve with spirit and resolution in the execution of our intended purposes.</p>
            <p>So soon as day light appeared I conducted our Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers to an adjacent rising ground, to explore the country round us, and reconnitre our enemies.</p>
            <p>This prospect in our circustances, afforded us so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate difficulties, that Captain Fraser bravely offered to take the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ting, that we should have our ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous upon the very ground and at the same spot we halted on the proceeding night. Thus we proceeded, chearfully and resolutely, in three separate bodies, and after each party had closed to our enemies sentries sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded and captured some parcels of straggling cattle, we severally marched away, undisturbed and unmoles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: with our separately collected prizes, to our appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ground of rendezvous, and there joined again in one collected body, without a single man amissing.</p>
            <p>The number of cattle we had collected, by no means gratifying my avidity, I requested the commanding officers to grant me a party of chosen men, who would readventure with me to scour the woods and grounds again, for more cattle. My proposal being accepted, and our wet arms, left with the party who attended the cattle we had in custody, thirty two brave volunteers, instantly turned out to obey my orders; with whom I proceeded on the rout, I thought to be most egligible, where we discovered and carried away thence, above thirty very fine Bullocks, with which drift we joyfully pursued and seasonably overtook our friends of the roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al

detachment, as they persevered on their long march homeward.</p>
            <p>Thus proceeding in one collected chearfull column; with eminent danger and the utmost expedition reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, for Crown-Point, we arrived in safety and high spirits that afternoon: possessed of one hundred and seven head of excellent beef cattle (ten of which number, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be part of my own stock, that were formerly plundered by, and now recovered from the rapacious Rebels.) And presently turned into the whole drift, a seasonable supply, before General Carleton, who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively viewed them: publickly thank'd me for my haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardous projected plan of operations: and applauded all of us, that were concerned in it's safe happy and success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful execution: it was a good supply.</p>
            <p>General Carleton with his usual and singular humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and generosity, at this time desired, that I would make up my own particular loss of cattle, out of these now under our capture; but with thankful acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement I replied, that it never should be said of me, I had courted for or taken the valiant soldiers hard earned prize, to indemnify my losses.

            <p>Crown-point having fallen to the British arms, and the season adapted to military attachments, being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted too much for our troops procedure to reduce Ticonderago, it was resolved by the commander in chief and his council to return for the winter to Canada, by Lake Champlain. As soon as the movement was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined on, his Excellency took so much care and notice of me and my concerns, that a Serjeant and twelve men were ordered up to my house, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of removing my family and effects, in safety; and carrying away whatever was valuable and portable, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionally, to transport all singly to Canada, under convoy of the royal army. The general being justly apprehensive of my meeting with the most severe retalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations from the exasperated Americans for my spirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed exertions to their detriment, during all the time of my unalienable attachment to him, and the British Troops. I repeat it, that he would not, on any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration suffer me or my family to run the hazard of staying in that quarter, behind the army, lest we should be hardly dealt with; nor at same time would he think of wanting my personal attendance and services, on his now concerted returning expedition. Agreeable to these friendly precautions, my family and some part of my effects were brought on, and secured as well as cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances would admit of; but all my crops of wheat corn and hay, utensils and other articles of estimation to me, were left behind; to the mercy and resentment of the revengeful Americans, which they soon destroyed, and carried away, totally; and have been ever since lost to me.</p>
            <p>My dwelling house and other buildings were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Under the escort of General Carleton and his army, myself, family and remaining effects, were brought to St. John's in Canada, where the attentive General order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed such houses as pertained to the r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, namely handsome pay to myself; and suitable provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made for supporting my family in my absence; and finally securing me and my successors in perpetual property of some valuable portion of crown lands.

            <p>But to return to the subject matter of my discourse with General Phillips. Being taken into serious consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration for some few days, and being frequently sent for, and pressingly urged by Mr Phillips in the name of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Burgoyne, to connect myself entirely and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ateful to their army, so as to assure them of my attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in this expedition; declaring that all reasonable sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction would be made for my time and services.

            <p>Thus it remained for some little time, that I had no particular office, employment, or department assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, until I was employed to conduct a number of Officers horses through the woods and mountains from Canada to Crown-Point; such a difficult ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Such rebuffs, in a matter of such indispensible duty, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>rvice, gave me an unfavourable idea, of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement, upon that expedition; and impressed me with apprehension, that more sacrifices would be made to wantonness than to prudence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and sorry am I, the sequel confirmed it.</p>
            <p>Overwhelmed with the dilemma, I was brought into (quite innocently, and seemingly designedly), I came to the very desperate though unadvoidable resolution of swimming my whole drift of horses, over the neck of water: in the execution of which perilous method, four of the horses were unlickily <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ost by drowning, in sight of the whole army, many of whom very much condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the dangerous expedient, that I was forced to take; and such of the Officers as were my real friends, had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion soon thereafter with much reason, to regret that accident the more; that I was considered liable for the damage, so far as to be obliged to replace two of the lost horses by giving a choice pair of my own best horses, which pair I could have readily sold for forty eight pound currency; yet never received the smallest part of payment, or other compensation, nor know I where to apply for any redress, but from Government.</p>
            <p>My having so judiciously conducted, and executed this hazardous expedition, with these horses, induced the Generals Phillips and Burgoyne soon to send for me, and having obeyed their hurried call, they again earnestly requested that I should then take a special connection with the army, so far as to subject me to military orders, entitle me to certain regular, handsome

pay; especially as they would that of all the men under their command; I allenarly, should return incontinently to St. Johns, Canada, to take charge of conducting up some of his Majesty's horses, there wanted for immediate urgent service, adding as usual, the most express assur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, and promises<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of my being handsomely rewarded at all events, for performing the business n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered them, with all diffidence, that I did not wish to enter into any military duty; preferring rather that I should continue in my present independence, and have perfect disposal of my time, for purposes of bringing up my family from Canada, or my settling there, as I chose; so as I night enjoy a quiet life, in peace, and be my own master.</p>
            <p>Then were such intreaties, promises and perswasions poured upon me, that I suffered all my objections to be over-ruled, and my difficulties were in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure then removed, by my getting an order instantly, from Colonel Carleton to the acting Quarter master-General at St John's, to furnish me a batteaux and hands, for the special purpose of carrying my family and effects to Crown Point; in full confidence of these promises and considerations, and my foolishly trusting to many stipulations that never were in any part per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, I was then and there persuaded to receive or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and immediately proceeded with all dispatch to St John's, Canada, to take charge of, and bring up the Kings horses now wanted; I set off and upon my arrival there, I received written instructions (yet in my possession) dated St John's 5th July 1777, from Natha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel Dav <abbr>Esq</abbr> commissary of horses, in which orders I am designed "John M'Alpine, assistant commss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

royal army at Crown point, or Ticonderago. The horses being accordingly put under my care, I observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at surveying them, that several were unfit for the present intended service, according to my comprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and therefore, I peremptorly refused to receive any horses that I deem'd improper. But at same time I draughted and received such cattle as I judged sound and suitable to the labour in view, and these numbered only 195 head, in the whole, I was sensible that Major Hughs, contractor for Horses had been shagreen'd, by turning so many unsound horses, on his hands: but I made conscience of my duty, and the confidence put in me by my employers: never putting my promised pay, douceurs, in comparison with my own honour: and my hearty regard to our public service. Having mustered my party of men drivers, and these 195 pick'd horses, I set out ordering necessary batteaux to proceed with suitable provender and provisions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and fixing upon certain appointed places of rendezvouz, for our meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the evenings, to refresh both men and cattle. In this manner did I pursue a most disagreeable journey of many days, continued for above one hundred and fifty miles of unbeaten roads, thro' mountains, woods and swamps, rivers brooks and lakes, till I arrived in safety at Ticonderago, with the insignificant loss of one horse only, which perished in the woods, through hurt fatigue, and sickness, in course of so very troublesome and tedious an expedition. It was universally acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that such a successful march, under so many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties had never been accomplished, in the course we travelled, nay the detachment that went in a road nearly similiar, some little time before me, and with some such number of horses, lost outright above thirty drove, besides many were hurt.</p>
            <p>At Ticonderago I met with the Major Hughs, I had formerly offended, by rejecting so many unsound horses at St. Johns, who now approved of my fidelity and conduct in the matter, and publickly declared, that I had successfully accomplished a difficult piece of service,

Should it not be a determined argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when all the preceeding circumstances recollectively considered, That since General Phillips prevented my embracing Major Hughs particular service and pay, I have consequently an undubitable claim to ten shillings and sixpence per day, since the aera of my being sent to Canada till some time in may 1778, when I was detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from military employment; yes, I ought, and I hope will be allowed it by Government; together with the full amount of my accompt of charge herewith given in, for all my debursements, expences and losses, incurred by and consequent of my public services and unshaken loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, all yet unrewarded; and I must with all due submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, observe to my readers, that however patriotism may animate men to glorious atchievements; it cannot be deny'd, emoluments will ever influence the best actions of mankind; why then not allow me such reprospective views, in common with the world at large.</p>
            <p>Our royal army then marching away from Ticondera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, for lake George, our people in hospital were in great want of fresh provisions.</p>
            <p>In this season of difficulty, I was thought of, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to, requesting I would undertake to go in search of some supply to these needy objects.</p>
            <p>As usual I consented, and was detached with a party

of fifty two men, up Olive Creek, to the new England country, with written orders from General Philips to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase live cattle for provisions to our sick men and due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pay full value therefore; In consequence I bought forty head of beef cattle with which I returned, and deliveryd them as directed, to our commissary at Ticon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derago: who ungracefully refused to pay the value that I contracted for, until sufficient evidence was giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en him, of the loyalty of the persons I had bargained with, which I well knew could not be obtained, as to my own knowledge, many of them were heartily disaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in this dilemma my honour engaged for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's payment, their delegate at my heels to receive their money, and Mr Phi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The commissary was thus ordered to pay the value; but in doing it he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained me so long unnecessarily, that I was entangled in a new plague and much loss to myself.</p>
            <p>For having that day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (4th August 1777) received General Hamilton's orders to carry some number of our prisoners from Ticonderoga, to Crown-point, in order to make hay there, for foraging the horses of our army; I accordingly entered upon that discharge of duty with my usual alacrity; and collected a necessary squad of our prisoners into a batteux prepared for our expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, being furnished with provisions suitable for our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and putting some effects an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Disappointed in this manner of my hay workers &amp;c. I again applied to General Hamilton, who directed me on the same service formerly ordered, with instructions to employ the people at Crown-Point and its environs to execute the labour of hay making, at the current rate for such work, and pay their wages. This trust, I attended and executed; drawing provisions and liquor from the garrison stores for supplying our workers, and finally paying the labourers wages out of my own pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, amounting to the sum of thirteen pound eleven shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings currency, of which sum I have never been reimburs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in any part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore include it in my charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Government.</p>
            <p>From Crown-Point I returned to Ticonderoga, where I was employed in transporting provisions, by Batteaux, for our army, to lake George; which necessary work being accomplished, I was then ordered by General Powell to proceed directly to our army under General Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goyne, who ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In this manner I continued to be constantly employed, till the propitious 19th September 1777, that the royal army successfully attacked the Americans at Freeman's farms, where, and in which action, I have the vanity to say with some truth that my conduct and behaviour was taken as much no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, as any private man in the service; for which I am convinced I can get the testimony of several officers of reputation then on the field, particularly from the gallant Captain Twiss, who conducted as chief engineer, and will acknowledge that his endeavours was much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitated, by my allertly bringing up two cannon, where he ordered them, and in the critical moment of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting a very desirous manouvre, in the execution of which exploit, I was in danger, yet I relieved and brought off a wounded soldier, and gave Captain Twiss my horse in the action.</p>
            <p>From that day I continued with the army, rendering every service in my power, and conforming my conduct to the commands laid upon me, night and day, till the beginning of October thereafter, that I heard with jeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousy and regreat, General Burgoyne had employed a certain man from Still-water (named Jones, and who was notoriously attached to the rebels formerly) to go as confidential express on some very private message to Ticonderoga for a reward of five hundred guineas, as was said.

life, to promote our public service's of every kind com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to me. In short my feelings were so smart, and my Delicacy so much hurt, that I determined to withdraw from attendance, and retire to my old rural habitation, poor as it was; which I mentioned to some officers of most intimate acquaintance, with loud complaint of the injurious intreatment given me, by the commander in chief, which I could not digest; and in this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>light of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment, I applied to Sir Francis Clark one of the Aid-de-camps for my pass homeward; in a few days Sir Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis gave me a pass, but upon the express condition that I would faithfully return to the army, as soon as my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily could be removed to Canady; or put under General Powell's protection at Ticonderoga; which obligation I pointedly acquiesced in.</p>
            <p>The following evening, an orderly Serjeant was sent me ordering my immediate attendance upon General Burgoyne, which message I obeyed with the more alacrity that I perswaded myself, now in the moment of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, was the acceptable time of my receiving, if not full payment for my attendance upon the army<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at least some handsome consideration, or allowance for my long, faithful and hazardous services, as I never yet received a shilling of pay or public money; but how great was my disappointment when in place of any reward, or even bare mention of it, I found a very cold indifferent recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from General Burgoyne, who asked me, if I was seriously going to leave him at this critical time of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; when he had so much confidence in me, depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon my loyal exertions, and every due sense of my essential service to the royal cause.</p>
            <p>My answer gave him to know that I had come to the resolution of returning now to my family, long distressed in my absence, and in the greatest need of my best offices, nor could I see any inducement for my dangling longer about him; as he had never give me any pay or gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for my trouble, loss and attendance</p>
            <p>That in place of finding him disposed to perform his promises to me I had unexpectedly discovered, that he had
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:045285_0016_101FE2BF27523150"/>
apparently lost all faith and dependance, on my honour and best endeavours; when he would employ a rebel or suspected person, to go confidentially, upon the late pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate errand, or particular message to Ticonderoga; a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>dence that should of right be committed to my often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced, well proved integrity. Being so exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly affected with that glaring instance of his disrespect for, and diffidence in me, I was finally resolved to bid him then, farewell; for which I hoped he would excuse me, and I was sure the world could not justly blame me. He passionately, then turned upon me, saying vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that I might depend on it, I had for ever forfeited his recommendations, liberality, and friendship: and he had rather that I had joined the rebels, than have deserted him in the present critical juncture. I must own I was put into some agitation, by the tenour of our whole conversation: and the disrespectful usage given me causelesly, which occasioned my replying, in displeasure,
<q>That were I inclined to connect myself with the rebel Americans, I had many favourable opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities and interesting offers before that day; and was quite certain, they would still give me a welcome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; but my principles were as loyal, and my heart as true to my gracious sovereign and his cause, as any other men in the British service; withall I was inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant of General Burgoyne, and the rebels too, and could find myself aggreable employment without serving either of them; nor would I for one day longer; but in the present time I wished it were duly considered that had jealously injured my health in running every ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard and taking constant fatigues; had very much hurt my family by neglecting them; and quite ruined my subject, by attending him so incessantly upon the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic service; and trusting to his promises never performed, without being ever favoured w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Finding that my hints seemed not to be understood; nor any regard to my complaints, I instantly withdrew

both parties much displeased, particularly me. That evening, I designed to take a public farewell of my good friend Major Hughs, Captain Twiss, and other officers, my distinguished wellwi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Repeating all my grievances, I declared to my esteemed friends, that I would decamp for good, let General Burgoyne find another when and where he best could; and accordingly I set off from camp very late at night<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and passed the rivers twice by swimming my horse in the dark, for dispatch and secrecy, to avoid being intercepted by the rebels.</p>
            <p>By five o'clock next morning I got to Fort George, having road above thirty four miles, in less than five hours; I here waited on the commanding officer, and informed him of what had passed with Mr Burgoyne, and my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention now; upon which he ordered a batteaux for conveying me to Diamond island, in the possession of our troops, under command of Captain Arberry of the forty seventh regiment; who also being made acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with my grievances and resolutions; he ordered me another batteaux to Ticonderoga. There I waited on General Powel, giving him a full detail of all my man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eauvers; which he tenderly expressed a feeling concern at, and used all arguments to diswade me from withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing entirely; but in place of leaving the service and then going home, I should remain with himself, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionaly employed in some duty, until I went upon the very first special errand, back to general Burgoyne; which might make up all matters, and he would take particula<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In short, I disavowed any confidence in Mr Burgoyne's sentiments, friendships, or operations: and thanking Mr. Powell for his overtures, I set off homeward that day.</p>
            <p>I had been only a few days consoling my family at home, when one express, and then a second came with the utmost hurry and confusion to my house, requesting my immediate attendance on General Powell at Ticon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derago, for every thing was lost, sure enough I repaired to him, with all speed, and there unhappily learned, that General Burgoyne and fine little army had been fatally made prisoners, at Saratoga.</p>
            <p>I cannot pretend to say, professionally there was any misconduct in that disaster: but to speak <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

General Powell, always pleasant, that tho' now in great perplexity and seeming despair, persevering in intreatys, I laid aside all view to my own interest and concerns at home, sacrificing these and my personal safety to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's important urgent services; and resolutely set about performing them; which by unwearied attention and perseverance, I got effected (in full) much sooner then my most flattering hopes, suggested: tho' attended with the unremmitting personal fatigues: in the expedition of which operations I contributed seventy days work of my own yoke, man servant four oxen, chains, and other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisites, for which Mr. Powell was to have paid a Dollar per day. That I now charge to Government, because I received no compensation then, through our hurry and confusion: and my own captivity, immediately conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, prevented my ever meeting Mr. Powell to have his promise implemented.

of December, that this pass was given me; when being furnished with some kind of recommendation from Cap. Monie, to Lord Radon (who befriended me) to Colonel Sherrif &amp;c. I set out for New-York (full of hopes) and in my way picked up a neglected grenadier, a cliver young fellow, whose exigences I believe had put him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der difficulties: him I refreshed out of my pittance and brought along to the city of New-York. Here I met with, and applied to, several acquainted officers, who well knew some merit in my long, and much neglected services to the public; reasonably guessed at my poverty; and were informed now, of the manner in which my liberty was so far obtained. To their praise be it here acknowledged, that many of these gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen's pockets were open to my necessary calls, as often as delicacy allowed; and they so assiduously exerted their applications to General Clinton (then commandant at New Y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

My arrival and exchange at New-York, being thus effected, I detatched every consideration of further connections with, the British service, or ever entering into permanent military orders; if any field of action, in private life, should occurr to me, with any tempting inducement's.

            <p>My liberty from all confinement, of every kind, being thus happily accomplished, at New-York? and the
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:045285_0021_101FE2D0342DBE08"/>
season of the year not affording the occcasion of any ship to Canada (where I very much desired to go, in quest of my wife, and only child, whom I had not seen of a very long time) I remained some months at New-York, quite disengaged from all business, public or private. In the course of which period, I made some approaches toward my being more known; but found no inviting hopes from the General, that would induce me to use some freedoms, I occasionally stood in need of, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I avoided the imputation of being thought too troublesome.</p>
            <p>My little cash being exhausted, I was put under the disagreeable necessity of addressing some particular friends for immediate supplies; but humane as they were, I was ashamed of repeating these applications thoroughly weary of an unactive life. I finally resolved to push into some Business or employment, and with that intention I communicated my purpose (with friendly freedom, to my very good acquaintance, Captain Ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truther of the 26th regiment, who commanded at Crown point, when I first went to it, anno 1773. With his accustomed generosity, he instantly assured me, of all the interest in his power, (fairly indeed exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by his former unwearied applications for my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change). By this worthy man, I was introduced to the acquaintance of Colonel Clark, barrack master Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, who promised me his friendship<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity offered. But no vacant birth being then in view, Colonel Clark recommended me to Francis Green <abbr>Esq</abbr> from Boston, then agent upon the estate of Henry Loyd <abbr>Esq</abbr> on long Island, who was in agitation of a contract with Colonel Clark, for furnishing fuel from that estate, to supply the troops in barrack at New-York.</p>
            <p>I was admitted to all the intimacy could be reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly exp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="41" facs="unknown:045285_0021_101FE2D0342DBE08"/>
I pay Mr. Green, the thankful tribute of acknowledging that he has all along continued in the same warm dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition towards me: invariable in his friendships, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remmitting in his virtuous kind offices.</p>
            <p>In consequence of Mr Green's uncommon offices, and singular attachment to me, I was greatly encouraged to adventure a further connection with him; accordingly I entered into three separate contracts of agreement, dated the the 24th April 1st June, and 26th November, all in the year 1778. for a certain farm, with all its produce, upon long Island: conform to the conditions specially narrated, in these several articles of agreement, yet extant in my hands, to which reference is here made for particulars, being the more especially attached to that indentical portion of land, that the most express protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had been granted by Generals Howe, and Clinton, to that estate, and its relatives; which were considered the most ample ever issued for any American loyalist's property.</p>
            <p>To that estate upon long island, I removed and lived in the family way a most contented, quiet and easiy life for several months, turning every produce to outmost ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, in so close a vicinity to the good market of New York; and having no interruption to my local happiness, but the alarms I might be occasionally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of some rebel depradations, from the opposite shore of Connecticut. My esteemed friend Francis Green esq. having this said constituents authority and interests always in his view, persisted in the scheme of supplying Colonel Clark, upon contract, with any quantity of fewel, or firewood, might be thought requisite for the troops in Barracks at New York: and having confiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially intimated his purpose to me, I approved the plan, and directly set on and continued a number of hands in constant employ, cutting and preparing that fewel to serve the Barrack consumptions; which I was bound to deliver free at New-York, at the fixed price of four pounds currency per cord, in terms of an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished contract. At which rate I could, and would
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:045285_0022_101FE2D1B6FF8B48"/>
to furnish any quantity of fewel, that the trops could possibly need, or should consume, while in Barracks; which I am positively certain would by a saving to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of several thousand pounds annually; which are wantonly, or through ignorance of circumstances, unnecessarily thrown away to jobbers, or Government contractors in the army.</p>
            <p>This declared fact, in the misconduct of that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular (I mean the Barrack) department, I can with ease make perfectly evident, if I am called upon, as I earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desire I may be, to support this assertion, now candid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly disclosed for our national advantage: and I anxiously desire that my explanation may be taken openly before the house of commons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to make them and the nation sensible of the material difference betwixt the extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant price charged in sterling money by army contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, for Barrack fewel, and the small allowance these last men made us of only four pound currency at per cord at New-york; yet I at same time admit, that this value or price is so equal to both parties, that if I am honoured with the employment of furnishing our troops with few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, in New<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In consequnce of Mr Green's scheme of supply to Colonel Clark one thousand measured cords of fewel were sent by me to New-York; but when it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived there, by the Barrack master's department, in my absence, they fell on sinister means (though plausible)
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:045285_0022_101FE2D1B6FF8B48"/>
of reducing that cargo, to only eight hundred cords of their cart measurement; which defalcation, being so large and glaring, that some imposition or deceit must be intended and effected; Mr. Green was very justly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed wrote me of the unaccountable inlake in that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go; and requested my explanation of the difference in contents; or any plausible reason for it.</p>
            <p>Here I thought a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h had been made at my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour by some person in the dark as might be said; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing recommended, as an honest man, by my good friend Colonel Clark, and by him to my patron Mr. Green, I considered my reputation much engaged or attacked by this perplexity, and was determined at all events to clear my character of any least participation in irregularity's. With that resolution, I went to New-York to wait on Mr. Green, and arrived there at the very time, another of my wood vessels was discharging her cargo. The master of that wood vessel was immediately complained loudly of the impositions used by the barrack department, at receiving the fewel occasioned by the iniquitous largeness of their carts; which in their contents, and the unfair method of cramming in the wood, at stowing very far exceeded the allowed measurement or contents of city regulation.</p>
            <p>I soon comprehended what the man meant; but to obtain a thorough knowledge of these circumstances of deception, I took the occasion offered, while the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters stopped work, to take dinner, to measure out a full statute cord of wood, upon the wharf: in the presence of several masters of vessels (then along side) whom I called to be witnesses to my regular procedure: and then ordered, that measured cord of wood, to be thrown down the wharf, carelesly as if tossed fairly out of my vessel: upon this wharf I remained, by the wood, to see how these Barrack carters wou'd then load their carriages, and my experiment would answer the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; I knowing well, that the statute cord should exactly correspond with four statu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> cart loads; whereas in the unjust manner, these Barrack jobbing carters,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:045285_0023_101FE2D855FDDA30"/>
were directed by Colonel Clark's people to fill up, cram, and load their carts (and actually did load) they forced stowed, and pack'd, the regular statute cord of wood, into three carts only, and still called for more fewel, to heap out and make up such loads as they were desired to take on.</p>
            <p>Here the cloven foot at once appeared, and thus they injuriously overloaded a full fourth part, above statute measure, which was a certain conviction to me, and all the spectators of the manner and cause that the two hundred cords of fewel had been lost, in the former car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, villainously swallowed up, and not accounted for as it justly ought.</p>
            <p>I instantly stopped the carts, called for Skippers, and masters of coal yards, and sent for some of Colonel Clark's assistants and servants, to inform them of what had passed, both as the proven measurement and fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent discovery certifying to them publickly, that I would never deliver to them more fewel in that barrack depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; nor have any thing to do with people of such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful methods, and injurious p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inciples. And by this discovery was the seed of their resentment sown against me and continued.</p>
            <p>Mr Green was soon informed of this open detection, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s easily convinced of its certainty; yet from a hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty desire to promote the public utility, he still offered to contract with Colonel Clark, for any quantity of fewel he required, delivered at the various landing or shipping places were on the state of Loyd's neck, in Long Island; if Mr Clark would appoint any inspector to superintend the measurements: but he positively would no further engage for any more deliverys of cargoes, at New York wharfs.</p>
            <p>This equitable proposal was rejected by Colonel Clark and his deputies, who in that open and fair way could not amass gain enough, much less could they buy commissions by fraudulent practices; therefore they rejected Mr Green's upright proffer, and renounced the contract; Colonel Clark having thus broke up dealing
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:045285_0023_101FE2D855FDDA30"/>
by advice of his deputies I dare say, Mr Green betook himself to the expedient of selling the wood of Mr. Loyd's estate, to private purchasers; but still with his restriction, that a preference of sale, should be always, given Colonel Clark, upon equal terms, for supplying the troops; and to this special obligation all the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasers frankly occurred, of which number I was a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal one.</p>
            <p>In virtue of these transactions, I and some other purchasers or contractors; set about selling and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the fewel wood; but we had no sooner got some quantity in readiness for market<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than some of Colonel Clark's mirmedons, laid hold on it, and forcibly discharging our people, at their peril to remove any part of it, from the premises, and thus at once put a stop to all the contracts Mr. Green had made, all on the false pretence, that the whole fewel was wanted for barrack use; which was well known not to be the real cause.</p>
            <p>To support the fact of this incontestable assertion, I affirm, and can prove, that for the space of eight months from the time they forcibly interrupted my particular work, and down to the middle of December last (1779) Mr. Clark's men had not cut one single cord of wood, that I contracted for, though they uniformally interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, and took the work, out of my hands: for which identical bargain, I would have paid the proprietor one thousand pound: which sum he has been deprived of since, as I am of considerable profits that would result theref<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>om, at the stated price. If it should be objected here, that there was not sufficiency of wood upon my neighbouring rebel estates, to supply our troops in the Barracks: I deny the allegation, and can freely make oath, that I publickly offered, and would chearfully have paid two thousand pound for one year's liberty of the woods and lands of these two identical Rebel estates, that Colonel Clark got, some how, into his clutches; and which I am confident has put several thousands of pounds slump, gratis, into the pockets of
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:045285_0024_101FE2D4A7B8B768"/>
Clark and his deputy's; as many thousands have got futully, which they have bilked the public of; and happy will I be, if called upon, regularly, to make my assertion, good: because my open averment of these circumstances, is with the, avowed intention of making the horrid fraudulent practices of the Barrack depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (in the matter of fewel for the troops) known to the whole world; and particularly doing justice to our injured nation.</p>
            <p>This unprecedented interruption from Colonel Clark and his demigoggs put a perfect stop to all our wood, transactions upon a loyal estate; under repeated protections; but very particularly hurt my interest, who had set a number of good hands to work, cut a large quantity of wood, and bought six teems for my own em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy: which in view of doing business in due season I had keeped through the long winter, at some considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble expence.</p>
            <p>These all, being then thrown idle, I offered their service's to Colonel Clark's men, at the common rate hire of the country; but in addition to my distresses, they rejected all concern with me, my people or cattle, though at same time they enlarged their gains, by impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing poor people's teems, and taking their own services too, at very insignificant rates, in the name of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment service. Being soon after, in want of drivers, through their under payments, the consequence was, they affected little or no teem work, the chief part of summer, and of course the garrison had only a few days fewel in store at the fall of the year; and without, the city was so ill provided, that for their general supply I ordered up some vessels loads, of wood and fewel to New-York.</p>
            <p>Two of these wood loaded vessels, were overtaken and captured in the sound or passage, by some Connecticut rebel plunderers, after they had nearly approached to New-York, where I was; upon my hearing of these disastrous captures I directly went in quest of, and bought two small guns, of two pounds sho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="47" facs="unknown:045285_0024_101FE2D4A7B8B768"/>
which I had placed in the stern of my boat, upon a a slide carriage, on the plateform, the other I got fixed on the clutch of a tree, and two waggon wheels to it: and having then given a call, to a few brave, confident, lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>al refugee's, and informed them of my intention, I asked, if they would boldly venture on such an expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They answering affirmatively, about fifty, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute fine fellows instantly turned out volunteers; and away we set that night, convoyed over the sound by a wood sloop, of four gun's, and attended by several whale boats to land our men, when necessary. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding about six miles in this manner, we approached the opposite shore, and by day break landed at Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch in Connecticut, with only thirty three of our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, leaving behind the rest of our men to guard our boats, and secure our retreat, should we be repulsed.</p>
            <p>Having reco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>noitred and paraded the shore and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, for the distance of full three miles round our land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place, we met with very insignificant opposition, by this time I became quite weary, walking and running about from one eminence to another, in taking proper observations, (a duty that became very necessary and was incumbent on me particularly, as I acted as sole commandant,) which induced me to lay hands on the very first horse fell in my way; and putting the strap of my cartouch box, in the brutes mouth, in directing bridle I rode about, bare backed, giving my most judicious orders, until we approached a Rebel posse or guard, who seemed disposed to interrupt us; those, we instantly attacked with spirit, and soon broke and dispersed the main body; making eight of their number, prisoners; one of whom I peremptorily order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away to fetch me a saddle and bridle, which he soon performed. We then marched boldly, to surround and capture some horses and cattle, that appeared in view, at a little distance, about some habitations. At this little village, some greedy men of my party (in imitation of the enemy marroders) discovered an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy disposition to mean p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>undering and depradations
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:045285_0025_101FE2DC2E9F9BA0"/>
and shamefully went the length of taking cloathing &amp;c. from some defenceless females (in contradiction to my express orders) which I peremptorily caused them restore, in full; commanding only to capture all the fighting men, arms, ammunition, cattle and horses that came in our power. Soon thereafter, we fell in with, and attacked a second Rebel party, whom we soon beat off the field, and captured thirteen men (one of whom was a villianous deluding priest) with several stand of good arms, some ammunition, and above one thousand pounds worth of fine cattle and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, which they guarded. This good prize we carried, towards the shore, where our body of reserve, and boats lay in waiting; but in our long march downwards, we were attacked violently, by a stronger body of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, whom we desperately encountred, and after a smart engagement we drove them clear off the field, with a sensible loss that they never attempted to give us any further interruption, in our carrying every article, to our place of destination. So that we proceeded without meeting any strange face, except some women that followed us, with a lamentable cry of compassion, to each of whom I gave a milk cow to nourish their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Being arrived at the Beach, my first essay was to survey my party and know how the men stood out, so much firing, I was much surprized to find that all my my brave fellows had escaped quite unhurt, and could not enough admire the favourable hand of providence, towards myself, that acting as commanding officer, and constantly running and riding to and again, in all these encounters and skirmishes, surrounded with bullets in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable, flying round me yet was never touched.</p>
            <p>Having now obtained the shore, with our prize of men prisoners arms, ammunition, cattle, and horses; we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>et instantly about shipping the whole, which was a tedious, difficult, dangerous operation, as we were circumstanced; for having only whale boats, to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sport the cattle, on board our large vessel, we were under the unavoidable necessity, of swimming and

               </gap>owing them away in drifts or parcels, for a considerable distance, till we reached the large vessel, adapted for taking them on board.</p>
            <p>It may be presumed that this method of conveyance, must take up a great deal of time (as in fact it did) and gave the enemy opportunity of assembling from all quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, in numbers, to attempt a rescue of some part at least of their cattle. They judiciously, improved the occasion of our very confused employment; and how soon they thought themselves strong enough for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault, they impetuously made one attack, about three-hundred men strong well armed, in full hopes of defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and destroying us. In the first rencounter, they found us too firm to be daunted or broke; so that in place of giving way to their very superior number (being above three hundred men to fifty only) we drove the cowardly Dogs, fairly beyond gun shot of our stationed ground, to which they never approached so nigh, as to interrupt our maneauvers, in taking of our prizes, so that we carried them wholly, safe on board without any other injury, than one of my men being shot thro<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the arm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a wound of no great detriment to him and ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Our expedition being now so far accomplished, we set off, huzzaing, and got all safe to our own opposite shore, of long island; and in triumph landed all our prizes, amidst the acclamations of our friends there, who as well as the multitude upon the Connecticut side had been spectators, to our operations; but never thought, that so pitiful an handfull of men (though resolute) could oppose, much less vanquish<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> such numbers of dastardly Rebels; and carry away our captures too, without losing a man of our party, and but only one man wounded.</p>
            <p>Our prisoners, headed by their priest, we sent off to New York jail, to ly there till exchanged for an equal number of poor worthy royalists, might be suffering in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocently, perhaps rotting in American dungeons.

denomination and disposed of them, equally among the brave fellows of my deserving detachment, who had valliantly risked their lives, in transacting one of the boldest enterprizes that had been attempted, since the first commencement of our war with the Americans: an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit which the multitude loudly applauded, and said no other than that desperate highland man, mad John M'Alpine, would have attempted or executed it.</p>
            <p>Many such maneauvres would be planned, and could be executed by me and many other bold, resolute, well meaning loyalists in America: were we only encouraged and allowed (though not assisted) to make due reprisals, on our unrelenting enemies; and unquestionably, we of that quarter of the world, who have suffered most and lost our all, in the present contention for independence; are and must be the fittest people, for such hazardous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits as this: and under proper conductors would sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom fail of success; but by some fatallity and distinction, the most deserving men are much discouraged, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respectfully treated; while the unactive poltrons are in estimation, through interest or connection, to the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual detriment of our national cause, and injury to the best of kings.—But to return to my fewel narration.</p>
            <p>During the transactions of this private adventure, a false report had been industriously propagated by the Barrack department, and their minions, of the prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing scarcity of fewel for the troops, in garrison, which occasioned a general intimation from the commander in chief, ordering all persons immediately cut down and bring in their firewood to New-York, else it would be taken from them gratis. This forced public order, gave the long wished for, much agitated opportunity to one Mr Gilbert Wauch (formerly of the city of Edinburgh,) now the favourite deputy of Colonel Clark barrack mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; of taking up all the fewel, he could get his rapaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous clutches on, no doubt at the easiest rates, (if any price at all) which indulgent orders, they captured, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent to this. Wauch improved so effectually to his
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:045285_0026_101FE2DDC7809BC8"/>
own private emolument, that he was soon enabled to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume the rank of a pretended gentleman officer, and paid two thousand pounds for a company, in the 57th regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if memory serves me, nor will this remark seem unnacountable, when it is known, as now, that the fewel is taken for a price next to nothing, though Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is charged at an extravagant rate: and had the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple not been oppressed, or had they been punctually paid, by the Barrack department, the stated prices allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the commander in chief: they would readily and chearfully furnish all the fewel was wanted for supplying both the army and city, at the moderate rate of four pound currency per cord, for doing which, I and others would and will engage, at same time this honest method of procedure, would have entirely prevented the General's forced severe order; which undoubtedly was occasioned, by the oppressive maneauvres and continual bad payment of the Barrack department in further execution of their insocial schemes: this same adventerous Gilbert Wauch sent me a letter in June 1779, informing me, that he had Colonel Clark's Directions to intimate to me formally, that I was strictly prohibited from further pasturing any horses, cows or other cattle on the estate of Mr Loyd on Long Island, then under lease to me, nor any authority increase my stock above the then number, as my whole land and pasture were wanted for the convenience of the Barrack department. Perhaps on any occasion such an inconsisten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> demand would seem laughable, but at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent was ridiculously presumptive, as I resided by lease upon part of Mr Loyd's estate, that stood under strict protection and that I was notoriously known, to be a proven loyal subject, who suffered uncommon hardships, and had lost my a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Besides, I was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> under the General's late proclamation, of safety and encouragement to all loyal subjects, for raising vegetables and other produce for the use of the troops; which certifyed to all discouragers of industry, and promoters of any turbulence that the
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:045285_0027_101FE2E326E43CE0"/>
contraveeners of orders would be condingly punished. To avail myself of this protection and encouragement from the General, I directly waited upon my superior, Mr Green<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> informing, the cause of my then visit, and by his direction I next attended upon General Jone's then commandant at New-York, both preferring my complaint and producing Wauch's letter me that had occasioned it, together with a copy of my answer to Wauch relative thereto. One of the General's Aid-de-Camps, told me in presence of some gentlemen then at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending, that Wauch certainly did not know what he was doing, for he was writing improperly, and acting without authority; for no peaceable loyal subject or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, were to be discouraged or disturbed in prosecuting industrious endeavours: nor would any man be put wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly under inconveniences, much less be excluded from local property, except where such steps were absolutely necessary for the public service; and in such events, full value would be paid, in compensation. I gave him to know that I was in the invariable practice of offering eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing my land afforded, and could be spared, even at an under value, to promote the utility: and intimated so much in writing, to Colonel Clark: but my conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scensions to that avaritious department seemed to have no discreet effect: nor would any condition content them but taking my whole gratis, and at once disable me from supporting myself and family: which has been since evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. At parting from the General's lodging, I met with Gilbert Wauch, and told him I had presented his curious letter to me. With a kind of plausable grimace, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that my return had reach<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d him, and he must own, I was rigorously dealt by; but he acted by Colonel Clark's orders.</p>
            <p>Some hours thereafter, I was sent for in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>rry to Colonel Clark's, where I had no sooner come than I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiated upon the many former injuries done me by him and his assistants in his name, which was now meant to be enlarged with more severity, by Wauch's, late notice to me in writing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> adding, that I knew no

cause given, for his avowed resentment against me, who had always studied his interest, so far as consistent with my honour; of which he had recent instances that he could not have so soon forgot. He stood convinced of all I advanced; and positively disavowed any intention of encroachment upon my property, or injuring my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest any how; in proof of all which he much pressed me to enter without delay into his employment, Mr. Wauch, adding, "That this will insure constant protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to you and your concerns" In answer I observed, that my loyal long services and sufferings, had dearly bought my protection, in any part of the British domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and I assured myself of its full enjoyment, and as to the proposals of attaching myself to his particular employ, I would not hesitate to accept the invitation, upon reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able conditions, namely that I must obtain the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of my ever good friend, Mr. Green; that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of my services should be adequate to the measure of my employment: and that the extent of my concern in their department, should be such as not to involve me in acts of severity, fraud, oppressions or other irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that might hurt my reputation, or be disagreeable to said Mr. Green, on whom I particularly depended. Seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to approve my remarks, and repeating assurances of friendship<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Bad as times were, I told them such an offer was no temptation to me, with which they seemed offended as much as I was, we parted equally displeased; and from that moment they industriously and avowedly plotted my ruin, as follows viz.</p>
            <p>Colonel Clark commenced these new oppressions, by attempting to settle their men as if duly billeted, upon my house; and this by force without authority, not thro' the cause of necessity; but purely in malicious resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but I awarded that designed blow, as two rebel houses fit for accommodating Clerk's workmen, were then standing unoccupied in my neighbourhood, to which they might resort; which circumstance justified my mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing resistance, and I availed myself of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="unknown:045285_0028_101FE2E6C3737FC8"/>They then applied for a warrant from General Jones, to billet their men, regularly on me, in view of taking forcible possession in my house, buildings forrage and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nsils, without consulting me; on which the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral sent orders to Colonel Ludlow our commandant, to advert that the public service was not interrupted, thro' my perveseness, as Gilbert Wauch reported. Mr Lud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low made me a polite visit. I being then indisposed, showed me the Generals order, and looking round him, said it must have been obtained, improperly, yet in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance he behoved to examine throughly; which being done he declared, that he could discover no waste in my possession<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but found <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o much of it in the other buildings, those waste, as would lodge more men than Clark and Wauch had at work: the state of facts he genteely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to General Jones, and prevented Wauch's further encroachment, at that time. This second disappointment, by no means allaying Wauch's malice but rather inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his rancorous heart; and he well knowing I was va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutudinary, else he durst not appear so very bold, swag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering at my door; he came in his impudent vulgar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to my house, and without any authority, presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tously took violently hold of my forrage, and other uten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sils, my barn, and part of my dwelling house; threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning my servants and forbidding them at their peril, to work any more to, or for me; but vilely entising them to go into his employment; which some did out of fear, and were never paid for their service; saying he would send me to the provost, in New York, as soon as I go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> well: to which I replied he had not power so to do, that I was too good a subject for the provost. In this unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedented inhumane manner did Colonel Clark by his barbarous deputy insult my indisposition, violently seize, and forcibly keep possession for several months, of the lands and others that I had under lease, and paying rent for, without ever offering or giving me the least compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation: nor would they accept my mild offers of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating to them all the conveniencies of my whole sub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:045285_0028_101FE2E6C3737FC8"/>
upon these premises, at any rate reasonable, 'twixt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest men, or by the apprizement of judicious people mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually chosen; to which fair proffers, no man of good principles would have objected.</p>
            <p>Under all the agitations, that my present indisposition and such tyrranical encroachments must have given my feelings, I remained quiet and submissive to the injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous treatment, they afflicted me with; on the one hand, being averse in giving the General any avoidable trouble, and on the other hand was disposed to use all mildness in preserving my temporary property, in both land and produce; until implacable Wauch, extended his arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary severities, the length of interrupting my servants, in manufacturing my hay, looking after my crop, and carting off my apples; or in short doing any other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisit works of the season upon my farm; nay not quite content with such a claim of injuries to my perishing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, which for want of health I could not give any personal attendanc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> they outragiously proceeded at last to remove my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ences, expose my fruit land, throw op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en my inclosed grounds, turn their cattle and horses in upon my reserved pasture: and almost totally trampled, eat, and ruined my whole crops of wheat, corn, hay, grass and vegetables<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of considerable value, so effectually wreaking his vengeance, that the subjects of my rent and support were not only lost, but next to being totally exhausted. So perfectly wasting Mr Loyd's loyal estate that his agent Mr Green, regularly entered a formal protest against Colonel Clark, and all his adherents, (par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly Bashaw Wauch) for legal indemnification of the proprietors interest; but that necessary step, not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending my claim for loss or damages, I fall to seek my redress, for the depredations of these cormorants in some of the British courts of justice, or from the British par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>liament, where I hope to be heard.</p>
            <p>While immersed in these calamities, I was plagued with the additional distress, of an unseasonable visit, at this time, from a rascally party of plundering rebels, from Connecticut side of the sound, who coming over
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:045285_0029_101FE2E863083B30"/>
the channel in the night time; surrounded my house, broke up, sized and destroyed every thing came in their way, and then departed, with whatever was valuable, or portable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> carry off, captivating fourteen good work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men, then in my employ, whom they took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way prisoners; and in that number was a very valuable Negro, a thorough bred handy craf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sman, worth to any man one hundred pound sterling, and for whom I would that day not have taken one hundred guineas of gold.</p>
            <p>Happily I myself escaped, by being deeply hid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hay in a certain concealed part of an outer house, in the most private manner, by which precaution I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided their vigilance and resentment: which expedient I was often necessitated to take for securing my person from surprize seeing I was so well known to, hated, and dreaded by these Connecticut Rebels, that many stratagems had been converted for my captivity; so that I seldom durst be two nights, at an end, in the same bed or house.</p>
            <p>Left in this dismal situation, between the unmanly ungenerous unprovoked vile machinations, of my rapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, malicious, and invidious country-men on the one hand! and the depradations of my mortal enemies, on the other. I was very much nonplussed how to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct myself: but recollecting that my most promising, immediate relief, might be obtained from that misled veteran Colonel Clark, and his avaritious tribe of depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and assistants, I applyed by petition to General James Pattison in october last 1779 (he being then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandant of New-York) praying his excellency would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to my grievances and grant <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eparation of the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages done me by Colonel Clark Barrack master Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral of his department, as the same is particularly stat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in my representation relative there to, No. 6 yet in my custody for p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oduction. Assurances were then given me by Captain Addi, aid de camp that due at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention would be paid my claiment representation, so far as having utmost justice done; and indeed I had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to believe that my ease had been taken under consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:045285_0029_101FE2E863083B30"/>
because, my best of friends, Mr Green told me Colonel Clark had acknowledged to him there was some money due me, in the payment of which, he Clark, was engaged, and would do me justice.</p>
            <p>Excited by this encouraging information, I soon at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended at the Barrack office, where Gilbert Wauch gave me to know, that he was going to wait on Colonel Clark upon the settlement of my affairs, which he thought would be finished by one o'clock that afternoon, when I might appear.</p>
            <p>With patience I waited till the appointed hour of day had been very long elapsed, and Wauch's fallacious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises were despaired of, in this dangling manner did I dance three weeks attendance, about Colonel Clark, and his paultry deputy, daily calling at the Barracks of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, to no purpose; till weary of paying any more court there, I addressed Captain Addie, who with regret told me, that General Pattison had taken my petition and its grievances under consideration; which he would willingly adjust by compromise: but the authoritatively, could not regularly attempt to determine, by reason that Colonel Clark complained upon, was at the head of his own proper department, and of course, the commandant could not cognisce. But Captain Aiddie genteely added, that by General Pattison's orders, he himself carried my petition to Major Andrew, one of General Clinton's, aid de-camp, in view of having it properly terminated: de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring me, in his name, to wait upon Major Andrew, for knowing what had been done I soon repaired to Major Andrew, with this message notifying my present difficulties, and the necessity of my going into England soon, unless some Redress was given me at New-York.</p>
            <p>The Major attentively hearing me, at some length, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired I might wait on him next morning at nine o'clock. Which hour being come, I duly attended, and to make the sure of matters, I gave in, a note in write repeating my grievances: the many distresses consequent thereof: for reparative of which calamities, I had been long giving
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:045285_0030_101FE2EC53F8EE28"/>
effectual attendances, and now intreated that matters might be finaly settled, before the commander in chief or his delegate. The Major then, to my great disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, putting me off with cooly repeating my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer answer that Colonel Clark, being an acknowledged gentleman of rank in the army; and a direct principal, at the head of his own proper department, he only could and certainly would do me material justice, without any compulsion; so recommended me to Colonel Clark's ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and integrity, for reparation in a genteel manner, since no compulsitors could be used, in the case, besides, that the commander in chief was so immersed in public business which engrossed his utmost attention, that he had no time to bestow upon my private affairs: nor could he detach himself<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for holding any courts of enquiry then at New-York.</p>
            <p>This repulsed, I considered it fruitless to make any further application at New-York; seeing the men in high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est ranks of military command in America, had in effect refused to interpose in redressing the grievances, of, and clamant injuries done an innocent, meritorious oppressed loyalist. Therefore despairing of any reparation in that quarter of the world. I took my leave avowing openly that I would ship myself for England, to lay my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and their oppressions in America, before our Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Sovereign, his ministry, my honest countrymen, and the nation at large, to evidence how inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously and barbarously the honest loyalists, our King's best friends, were treated and often neglected by his Majesty's servants abroad.</p>
            <p>Acordingly I prepared for the voyage, and taking my passage in one of the fleet then getting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eady to sail for England; and embarked the 23d December. 1779 on board the Houghton store ship, in the ordinance service, paying sixteen guineas for my passage, and fifteen more for my stores. With thirty days tempestous weather, we run it to Milford Haven in south Wales, whence I push<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my way to London, in the flattering hopes of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my honourable and esteemed acquaintances.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="unknown:045285_0030_101FE2EC53F8EE28"/>none of them had I the pleasure of seeing, viz, the Earl of Belcarras, Lords Petersham and R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

            <p>If my country men are not deaf to the voice of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity and gratitude, I certainly have some claim to their attention in both these views of me, and I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionably the more encouraged to hope for their friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly considerations: that since my arrival in Britain, I have learned, that many people who never endured losses, hardships, and services, in any degree comparable to my very severe tryals, have been esteemed worthy of public notice and rewards; and that many loyal American re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fugees, are at this juncture under pensions, or receiving gratuities, for only practically losing their fortunes, whereas unhappy I, have totally lost my all. Withal, there may be few, if any, of these good men, who can say candidly, that they ever toiled, travelled and fought in the Royal cause; as I have repeatedly, chearfully, and am ready yet to do, if called furth to action, if any quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the world, for the cause of my King and native country.</p>

The vegetation to the northward is less vigorous than to the southward; the trees being neither so tall, nor the herbage so rich. The grass, though high, is thin, and the trees large, two kinds only of which could be considered as good timber, are seldom less than forty feet asunder. There are likewise trees covered with a soft bark, the same that is used for calking of ships in the East Indies. There are three sorts of Palm, and a Variety of plants to enrich the collection of a botanist, but very few of the esculent kind.</p>

The tail is as long as the whole body, and tapers towards the end. This animal, when dressed, is most excellent food.</p>

Parrots, paroquets, cockatoos, and other birds of exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site beauty pidgeons which fly in numerous flocks; doves, herons, bustards quails, crows, hawks, and eagles; pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans of an enormous size, and many sea fowls that are unknown in Europe.</p>

The insects are princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally caterpillars, butterflies, musquitos, and ants; some of these are quite black and construct their habitations on the inside of branches of a tree, by taking out the pith, almost to the extremity of the slightest twig, and yet those branches flourish as if they had remained in their natural estate. If a person break a branch, he is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately covered with millions of animals, which inject their stings with incessant violence.</p>
               <p>The sea furnishes the inabitants with a much more plentiful supply of food than the land.

               <head>INHABITANTS.</head>
               <p>This country is very thinly inhabited. The men are of a middle size, and in general clean limbed, nimble and active. — Their skin is of a chocolate colour; but their features are far from being disagreeable, for their noses are not flat, nor their lips thick; their teeth are white and even, and their hair naturally long and black, though they all crop it short; their beards are bushy and thick. Both sexes go naked, and seem to have no sense of decency in thus discovering their bodies. Their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal ornament is a bone thrust through the cartilage that divides the nostrils: as this bone is as thick as a man's finger, and between 5 and 6 inches long, it reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es quite cross the face, and stops up both nostrils, they so snufffle when they speak, as to be scarcely intelligible to each other. They have also neck laces made of shell, bracelets of small cord wound three or four times round the arm, and a string of plated human hair round their waists; some of them have also gorgets of shells hanging round the neck. They also paint their bodies white and

               <p>Nothing like a town or village was to be seen in the whole country. The huts at Botany Bay, where they are the best, are but just high enough for a man to sit upright in, and will not admit of his being extended at length. They are made of pliable twigs in the form of an oven, by sticking the two ends in the ground, and then covering them with palm leaves, and broad pieces of bark. The door is only a large hole at one end; yet in this miserable hut three or four persons lie, coiled up with their heels to their head. Far to the northward, where the climate is warmer, none of their huts are more than four feet deep, and one side entirely open.</p>
               <p>The only furniture belonging to their houses appears to be an oblong vessel made of bark, by tying up the ends with a withe, which being cut off serves for a handle. These are used to fetch water. They have also a small bag, about the size of a cabbage net, made somewhat in the manner of knitting, which the man carries upon his back, by a string that passes over head. This contains a lump or two of paint, some fish hooks of shells, and lines, a few points of darts, and their usual ornaments, which includes the whole worldly treasure of the richest among them.</p>
               <p>These people have not the least idea of traffic, not could the English prevail on them to exchange one thing for another.—They set such a value on their own orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that they would not part with the least article for any thing that could be offered them, however shewe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Their weapons are spears or lances of different kinds, these they throw with such good aim, as to be more sure of their mark than an European with a single bullet; they also wear a shield or target of an oblong form, of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three feet long, and about half that width, made of the bark of a tree.</p>

               <p>Capt. Cook's commentator, (Dr Hawkesworth) remarks in favour of the increase of population which our globe is capable of, that New Holland, a country equal to all Europe in magnitude, admirably well calculated by its situation, and no less so by its soil, to afford subsistance, together with every social and rational enjoyment, to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thousands of rational beings, which at present is the solitary haunt of a few miserable savages, destitute of cloathing, ill provided with food, and whose lives are rendered supportable, merely by the principle of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, with which the Creator has endowed all his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, namely, a conciousness of existence.</p>
               <p>The same writer observes from the present state of

the world, it seems highly probable, that the 19th cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury may be favourable to population beyond any former period of time. It is, however, to he added, from the present undertaking of Government to colonize a part of this extensive track and civilize its inhabitants, that the 18th century gives dawn to the projected population; and as under the reign of George III.

It had its name from Sr Wm Alexander, secretary to K. James I. who had the first grant of land in it, and called it Nova Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia. Its chief commodities are furs and codfish; and its chief towns are Halifax, Annapolis, Causo, and St John's —Halifax the capital, stands upon Chebucto-bay, and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>To Judge of the climate of Nova Scotia by the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude would lead any person into the most egregious mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes. It lies between 43 and 49 deg. of N. latitude, and between 60 and 67 W. longitude; and in the same la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude in Europe we find some of the most pleasant coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries in that quarter of the world; but in Nova Scotia is very different. The winter lasts seven months, and is of a severity dreadful to new comers. The deepest rivers are frozen over in one night, so as to bear loaded wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons; the snow lies deeper than ten feet in many places, and even upon level tracts it is sometimes six feet deep. The inhabitants are shut up in their houses, and except, in towns, lead a miserable life. They are almost in as torpid a state as the vegetables of the country: much of the summer is spent in laying up fuel for the winter: brandy and rum are there the greatest luxuries the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple indulge themselves in.</p>

But what is as bad as these extremes of heat and cold, and tenders this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try particularly unwholesome, are the continual fogs: they last far into the summer.—Such is the climate of Nova Scotia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is bad to excess, and would make one conclude, that is unacqainted with these latitudes, that it would banish husbandry altogether; but this is not the case.</p>

They fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the salt marshes on the Bay of Funda, which tho' it required a very great expence to drain them, yet the fertility of the Soil repaid the farmer much better than other tracts easier gained.</p>
            <p>The Soil of these marshes is a white or blue clay, mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and marly when cultivated: if the water is well car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried off, it will produce great crops, being suitable to the heat of the summer. In September their corn is ripe.— The woodlands, when cleaned, they plant with pease, potatoes, cabbages, &amp;c. the last of which is very useful to them, as they keep them below the snow during the winter.</p>
            <p>The game in this country is amazingly plenty, and from the general freedom of sporting and fishing, they derive no small advantages to their families. It is assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, on good authority, that a boy of 12 years of age, with his gun, would maintain ten or twelve of family the year round, pork and bread excepted. Two boys have been

            <p>THIS province is bounded on the N. by New Britain; on the E. by Nova-Scotia, New England, and New-York; on the S. by the Apalachian and Cherokee moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains: and by the great lakes and unknown lands on the W. The chief productions are furs and castor; and the principle cities are Quebec, Montreal, and Trios Riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers — Quebec, the capital of all Canada, is situate at, the confluence of the Rivers St Lawrence and St Charlet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 320 miles from the sea. The number of inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants are computed at 12 or 13,000.</p>
            <p>The climate of Canada is much colder in the winter than Nova-Scotia, which perhaps is owing to its being at a greater distance from the sea: yet it is greatly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable: the air is clear and pure, and in general the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants enjoy as good health as any set of people in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica. The productions of this country plainly show it is superior to Nova Scotia, for here the inhabitants have both pumpions and melons, apples and pears, in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; whereas in Nova-Scotia, though it cannot be said to be entirely without them, yet there are but very few in comparison. To the South of Canada, about Montreal, the climate is far more mild than at Quebec.</p>
            <p>The north-west wind blows through winter with a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity scarcely credible: it plainly comes through all walls that are not very thick, and with such violence, that if a candle is held against a wall of a brick and an half thick it will be instantly blown out: all the insides of such walls opposite to the north-west are covered with snow. The walls of the houses must be of a very great thickness, and at the same time well sheltered by woods and hills, for people within not to feel the wind blow on them. This dreadful north-west wind is felt all over the continent, even to Charleston in South Carolina. This wind in Canada is more severe than in Nova-Scotia; the snow is
