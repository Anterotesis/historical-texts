            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THERE is no paſſion more deeply and univerſally implanted in human nature, than that of tranſmitting our names to poſterity, and living, though dead, in the affections of the wiſe and the virtuous. And great is the wiſdom and goodneſs of God in thus conſtituting ſuch beings as we are; for this principle acts as a ſpur and a moſt powerful motive to great and generous actions. It keeps all the wheels of ſociety in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual motion, preſſing millions of intelligent crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures forward, and conſtantly ſoliciting them to attend to their various duties, and to excel in their ſeveral profeſſions. It is ſo cloſely interwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:037425_0003_100D2F4DB847FD50"/>
with the love of our being, that it proves the ſource of our nobleſt pleaſures and of our keen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt pains. But, like all other paſſions, it has ſometimes been perverted, and its influence diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded. Characters have appeared ſo extremely degraded, and ſo totally loſt to every thing praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, as to prefer, if we may judge of their feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings from their behaviour, an <hi>infamous</hi> to an <hi>honourable</hi> diſtinction. But, however depraved human nature may be in the opinion of ſome, to excel in wickedneſs, and with the view of being tranſmitted to poſterity as ſingularly profligate, has not been the ambition of many. Few have appeared ſo ſtupidly inſenſible to the judgment of the public, as not to be moved, either by its praiſes, or cenſures. It is the wiſh of the peaſant, as well as the deſire of thoſe who "deviſe liberal things," and who "by liberal things ſhall ſtand," to have a name and a place among the living, though numbered with the dead. And although many of the richeſt charities, and the moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful monuments of piety, have originated from the pureſt principles of chriſtian love; yet, ſhall we be charged with ingratitude and want of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:037425_0004_100D408463D654E8"/>
when we ſuggeſt, that others, equally orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental and beneficial to ſociety, have ariſen from the natural and pleaſing expectation of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered <hi>here,</hi> as well as rewarded <hi>hereafter?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this grand ſource of life and enterpriſe we are indebted for moſt of the conveniences and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gances of life, and for many of the moſt uſeful and ſhining characters that have appeared in the world. The ſtateſman, the ſage, the hero, and even the holy man of God, have experienced its efficacy. Indeed, this love of pre-eminence, this vying with each other in the race of perfection, has unfolded the moſt brilliant talents, and matur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſublimeſt virtues. It has frequently checked the career of the wicked, when nothing elſe could have done it, and made thoſe, who would otherwiſe have been the ſevereſt ſcourges, the moſt ſubſtantial bleſſings to ſociety.</p>
            <p>But, if this principle be ſo very powerful and beneficial, as it reſpects things <hi>temporal,</hi> how much more efficacious muſt it be, when it embraces things <hi>ſpiritual and eternal!</hi> We ſee that the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of all our preſent purſuits are ſhort-lived, precarious, and periſhing. All the agreeable and pleaſing proſpects laid open to us by affluence, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037425_0005_100D4085EF21E718"/>
and ſenſe, are but for a moment in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon with thoſe of eternity. If, therefore, it be a laudable deſire to aim at tranſmitting our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories to poſterity with honour, (and certainly it is,) it muſt be infinitely more worthy of our moſt ſtrenuous exertions, to ſecure a title to thoſe things, which "eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man;—the things which God hath prepared for them that love him."</p>
            <p>But it is not certain, that this future reward of the righteous, however familiar the doctrine may be to us, is the reward promiſed in our text. For, as the promiſes annexed to a virtuous life in the Old Teſtament are chiefly, if not wholly, temporal, it is more than probable, that the Pſalmiſt did not extend his views ſo far, but that they were confined to the preſent life only. However, as he ſaw that the character of a righteous man was ſo worthy and truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable, as to command the eſteem and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of all around him, by "everlaſting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance," he undoubtedly intended the moſt honourable and permanent rewards, of which he had any conception.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:037425_0006_100D408795A16E08"/>By the "righteous," the ſcriptures often mean no more than a <hi>juſt</hi> man; one, who is ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly exact; who gives to every man his juſt weight and meaſure; and who pays the moſt religious reſpect to all his engagements. But the character before us is much more lovely and excellent; it is that, which may emphatically be called the GOOD MAN. In the verſe immediately preceding the text we read, "A good man ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth favour, and lendeth; he will guide his affairs with diſcretion. Surely he ſhall not be moved forever." "The righteous," it follows, "ſhall be in everlaſting remembrance." The gratitude of individuals, and the applauſe of the public, ſhall tranſmit the name and the merits of the perſon endowed with this moſt "excellent ſpirit" to the lateſt poſterity.</p>
            <p>There is a great difference between theſe two characters, the <hi>juſt</hi> and the <hi>good</hi> man, though they are often conſidered as the ſame. The former is eſteemed a ſafe and a reſpectable character. But what has the man fallen among thieves, ſtripped, wounded, and lying in the highway half dead, to expect from it? Not that he will pour wine and
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037425_0007_100D408947B57320"/>
oil into his wounds, ſet him on his own beaſt, carry him to an inn, and ſee him taken care of at his own expenſe; for mercy is no conſtituent part of this character. Such a man, though juſt, may be auſtere; as he pays, ſo he may exact, the uttermoſt farthing; he may withhold his bounty, live to himſelf, and have no "bowels of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion" for his fellow creatures. But the <hi>good</hi> man is not only a righteous man and poſſeſſed of all his merits, however reſpectable they may be, but of many more, even an aſſemblage of all the moſt generous and amiable virtues.</p>
            <p>But, to return to the rewards of the righteous. Our bleſſed Lord, through whom "life and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality are brought to light," has given all his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful followers the fulleſt aſſurances, that they ſhall live forever; not only in the remembrance of their fellow creatures, but in the eſteem of all the holy angels, and even in the friendſhip of God himſelf, by whoſe example and moral perfections they have formed their tempers. This is an "everlaſting remembrance" indeed, beyond which, as it includes everlaſting happineſs, we cannot extend our deſires.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:037425_0008_100D408B603D8658"/>And to animate us all to aſpire after theſe higheſt and unfading honours, though as ſocial creatures we cannot wholly ſuſpend our deſires after others, I ſhall lay before you the character of the righteous, or good man; on whom they will all, eventually, be publicly and ſolemnly beſtowed.</p>
            <p>And here we may obſerve, that the firſt and great object of a good man's attention, is the glory of God, and the eſtabliſhment of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the hearts of men. Convinced of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate connexion between vice and miſery, and of the beneficial effects of virtue in families, in ſtates, and in the whole conduct of human life; he conſiders it as his indiſpenſable duty, and as the greateſt benefit he can poſſibly confer on his fellow creatures, to encourage and extend its influence among all orders and ranks of men. Every favourable opportunity he ſtands ready, and is moſt heartily diſpoſed, to embrace, to promote the love and practice of truth and righteouſneſs. His deſire is, to enrich the minds of all his neighbours and acquaintance with the pureſt principles of love to God and benevolence
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037425_0009_100D408E52D9F550"/>
to man, and to engage their hearts in the purſuit of every virtue. His time and his talents are all employed in doing good, and all the good he can. Thus he co-operates with the diſpenſations of Divine Providence, and conforms to the example of God himſelf, who has done every thing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the freedom of moral agents, to arreſt the progreſs of vice and wickedneſs; to baniſh ſin and miſery from the world; and to eſtabliſh a kingdom of righteouſneſs, peace and joy upon their ruins. And, by a careful cultivation of this heavenly temper, he goes on "from ſtrength to ſtrength," until he arrives at perfection; when virtue becomes familiar, and its practice eaſy. And here we may obſerve, that, although the heart of the good man is thus conſecrated to God, and to the ſervice of his fellow creatures, we diſcover no ſymptoms of that raſh and intemperate zeal by which ſome have been guided, and which would annihilate the rights of conſcience, and ſtifle the tendereſt charities of the goſpel. For, although fixed in his faith and mode of worſhip, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable in his ſentiments of religion, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders the right of private judgment as ſacred and
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:037425_0010_100D409012087480"/>
unalienable; and, both by his precepts and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, diſcovers his entire diſapprobation of all thoſe unfriendly and miſtaken principles, which limit the grace of God, in favour of the choſen few, to the excluſion of numerous ſects and parties. With Saint Peter he perceives, "that God is no reſpecter of perſons; but, in every nation, he that feareth him, and worketh righteouſneſs, is accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him." His love, therefore, abounds to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his fellow creatures, until it overcomes the force of all "idle and nominal diſtinctions" what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. The man of an upright life, and whoſe converſation is agreeable to the grace of God in the goſpel, is cheerfully admitted to all the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of a chriſtian brother. It matters not where he was born, how he was educated, nor in what form and mode he worſhips God; for ſuch is the effect of chriſtian charity, that it withholds its affections from no ſect nor nation, and from no individual, whoſe life and converſation are agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the goſpel.</p>
            <p>Another branch of this great and excellent cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter is, firmneſs of mind, fortitude ſuperior to the moſt flattering proſpects, and to the moſt
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037425_0011_100D4092596236F8"/>
powerful oppoſitions, and which can ſupport itſelf, in the purſuit and execution of all wiſe and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous meaſures, againſt the imprudent ſolicitations of friends, the inſidious arts of hypocriſy, and even the menaces of tyranny. No change of times, of fortune, or of men, can prevail over his integrity, or lead him to give up his ſentiments, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate from what he conceives to be the line of his duty. In none of his views is he governed either by the praiſes or cenſures of the public opinion; and therefore he is always diſpoſed to adopt thoſe meaſures, which from a cool and diſpaſſionate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, he is fully convinced are prudent, juſt, and ultimately beneficial. He will not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by the venality of thoſe, who have not the reſolution to countenance and approve of his virtuous exertions for fear of diſgrace, and who dare not contradict the general opinion, however apparently miſtaken, and prejudicial to the public welfare. He can read diſapprobation in the faces of individuals, and meet the frowns of a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided multitude, with a countenance undiſmay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and an heart that fears no evil. The teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of a good conſcience, accompanied with
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037425_0012_100D409651E0C840"/>
the hopes of futurity, is more than a compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for all theſe terrors. Not that he pays no deference to the judgment of others, and is inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to public eſteem; but that he is reſolved to prefer his duty to all other conſiderations; and that he never will embrace and recommend a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure repugnant to his reaſon and conſcience, not even for a moment, for all the moſt flattering proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects of riches and power.</p>
            <p>Again: A good man, however extenſive his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, will be cautious how he mentions them. Knowing the imperfections of our common nature, though favoured with all the ſuperior advantages of birth, titles and fortune, and placed in the moſt elevated ſtations of life, he cannot "glory;"—can neither inſult nor triumph over the miſtakes and errors of his brethren. And if he is obliged to cenſure their ignorance and follies, it will be with compaſſion, and not with ſeverity. However ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent his abilities and accompliſhments may be, he can diſcover the merits of thoſe, who move in more humble ſtations, and can "condeſcend to men of low eſtate." He leaves it to others to eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate his worth, and to proportion the meaſure of
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037425_0013_100D4097E1F0CC08"/>
his fame. As he would not give pain, he avoids breaking in upon the claims of others, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers none in his own behalf. Without any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of reſentment he can bear with ingratitude itſelf, when appreciating his merits, and pardon the man, who endeavours to leſſen his glory. Self-preference has ſo little influence upon a mind thus elevated, that it can look down upon the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude contending for perfection, with the higheſt degree of complacency. When he beholds a genuine virtue, no matter how humble the mind and condition in which it was matured, he can ſelect it for his own imitation, and, without pride or envy, acknowledge the merits, and praiſe the efforts, of all who endeavour to equal or ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs him in reputation. The moſt laviſh en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comiums beſtowed on the <hi>real</hi> deſerts of others betray in him no ſymptoms of reſentment. The piety and candour of his heart are ſo generous and pure, that he can "rejoice with them that do rejoice," and give "honour to whom honour is due." And without any invidious compariſons he is diſpoſed moſt humbly to acknowledge, that "promotion cometh neither from the eaſt, nor
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037425_0014_100D409AB8248348"/>
from the weſt, nor from the ſouth;" but that "God is the judge; he putteth down one and ſetteth up another."</p>
            <p>Further: The good man is ſtrongly oppoſed to every kind of diſſimulation. He knoweth not how to flatter. In no part of his behaviour can we diſcover ſo much as the ſhadow of duplicity. The example of the "double minded" man ſtrikes his righteous ſoul with abhorrence. And indeed, take it "all in all," it is one of the moſt contemptible, if not one of the moſt dangerous, characters in ſociety. The good man's faith, piety, and morals, are all ſincere. The affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his heart, whence every thing belonging to true religion derives its value, are all pure and undefiled. Convinced that neither rites nor ceremonies, nor yet all the externals of piety, can be accepted of God as a ſubſtitute for that righteouſneſs, which he requires, he conſiders all the duties of religion as deſigned to promote moral rectitude;—to enrich our hearts with the ſublimeſt virtues;—and that nothing which does not contribute to this moſt excellent end is worth contending for; and therefore all his claims to
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:037425_0015_100D409CEB793238"/>
the character of a chriſtian are built upon that faith in Chriſt which is unfeigned, and "which worketh by love." And this ſame open and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral principle prevails in all his tranſactions with mankind. He is a ſtranger to thoſe pitiful ſhifts, to which even the moſt ſubtle hypocrite is ſometimes obliged to have recourſe, in order to juſtify or apologize for his conduct. When ſelf-intereſt is the prevailing principle in a man, and that to which all others give place, there is no cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating upon the deceptions and miſchiefs to which the incautious are expoſed in all their commerce and connexions with him. The kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt expreſſions, the ſtrongeſt profeſſions of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and the moſt flattering expectations, are all in their favour. But theſe are ſoon forgotten, and nothing can be realized, but ſhame and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification. But as the good man has no intereſts unconnected with the intereſts of others, and which may not fairly and openly be promoted, he can have no temptation, either to diſſemble or flatter. If he profeſſes himſelf your friend, his profeſſion will prove ſacred and inviolable. You will find him an "Iſraelite indeed," and ſhall
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:037425_0016_100D409E96E5D100"/>
never ſuffer through a miſplaced confidence. Let his ſtation and office be what they may, he will "keep the faith," and hold faſt his integrity till he dies.</p>
            <p>Again: The good man endeavours to be perfect, or merciful, as his "Father which is in heaven is perfect." This is a duty of ſo delightful a nature, and accompanied with ſo many ſweet fruits in the performance of it, that one would imagine no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing need be ſaid to enforce the practice of it. However, we may obſerve, that the common happineſs of our fellow creatures is by no means a common concern. Thouſands are ſo loſt to this godlike propenſity, as to live to themſelves only: they diſcover no ſentiments of pity and compaſſion, and do not appear to have any inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in the general welfare of mankind. They never reflect upon the ſufferings of thoſe, who have long ſtruggled with the calamities of life, and who are ready to ſink under the weight of their burdens; and therefore they have no wine and no oil for their conſolation. And yet we can have no doubts, when we attend to "the words of our Lord Jeſus," who ſays, "It is more bleſſed to
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:037425_0017_100D40A265C5B550"/>
give than to receive;" whether he who delights in acts of mercy, and performs them from the pureſt motives, or he who receives the benefits which flow from this heavenly temper, enjoys the greateſt happineſs. But, however influenced by theſe intereſting ſenſations—theſe tender vibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a good heart—the merciful man may be, (and no doubt they are the ſtrongeſt propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of our nature,) yet the ſtate of ſociety, and the duties of his office, may ſometimes be ſuch, as to compel him to cut off thoſe who are oppoſed to the common ſafety and happineſs; but not without bringing home to his own heart a ſtrong ſenſe of their ſufferings. Such is the force of this principle, that he is always diſpoſed, when it can be done without injury to others, to pity, to ſpare, and to ſave, even the evil and unthankful. He conſiders the frailty and weakneſs of human nature, and knows that we all ſtand in need of favourable allowances and interpoſitions of mercy. For, however fortunate and independent, no man can ſay to his brother, any more than the hand can ſay to the foot, "I have no need of thee." As the indulgence of each cruel and malevolent paſſion
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:037425_0018_100D40A5552285C0"/>
increaſes the meaſure of human miſery, ſo the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions of mercy and compaſſion leſſen the weight of our ſufferings. And beſides, the good man perceives, that the habit and practice of theſe precious virtues perfect our nature, and make us like God.</p>
            <p>Finally: The good man has the ſincereſt affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for his country, and thinks no ſacrifice that he can offer too great for the promotion of its proſperity and glory. He ſees that all are not qualified for places of confidence and diſtinction, and that his happineſs does not depend ſo much on the ſtation in which Providence has placed him, as on a proper improvement of the talents committed to his care. If, therefore, he is poor, he will be an example of induſtry and economy; and if rich, of ſobriety and charity. Inſtead of coveting the abundance, or envying the merits, of thoſe whom fortune and the public eſteem have rendered more conſpicuous than himſelf, he will "ſtudy to be quiet, and to do his own buſineſs." He knows it to be his duty, his intereſt, and his honour, ſo long as he enjoys the benefit of "mild and equal laws," and is in poſſeſſion of all the rights
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:037425_0019_100D40A6F65CEA78"/>
of man, to guard and protect the fountain from whence they flow. He feels the worth and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a good reputation in himſelf too much to lead him to "ſpeak evil of dignities," or to liſten to the calumnies of thoſe who do. When he meets thoſe who are not aſhamed to glory in their vices, and to oppoſe the righteous and thoſe who are labouring to eſtabliſh the public welfare, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted by their cenſures, he will ſpeak, and not keep ſilence, but rebuke ſharply. Neither hopes nor fears can extinguiſh or leſſen the ardour of this glowing and patriotic principle. Even ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and the deepeſt ingratitude cannot overcome it, for he looks upon himſelf as born for the good of the community; and therefore his time, his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, his eaſe, and even his life, ſhould neceſſity require the ſacrifice, he is ready to devote to the ſafety of his country.</p>
            <p>Such would be the character of the good man, as far as circumſtances <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>mit, even in the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler walks of life; and if we admire the utility and dignity of it in the private citizen, how much more illuſtrious and extenſively uſeful muſt it appear when clothed with the authority, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced at the head, of a great nation!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:037425_0020_100D40A9CE8D3C28"/>Here we behold power and goodneſs united; from which union the righteous have nothing to fear, but every thing to hope. This will be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, when we attend to his wiſe and upright adminiſtration. For he will "rule in the fear of God," and make it his principal object to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the intereſts of his kingdom; and thereby he becomes "a terror to evil doers," as well as "a praiſe to them that do well." His integrity and firmneſs are not to be ſhaken by the voice of the multitude. Superior to all influences of friends and parties, his great and independent mind will not ſuffer him to patroniſe any but the meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and thoſe who are worthy of public confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Amidſt all the intrigues and contending paſſions of the envious, the diſappointed, and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious, he maintains his dignity, and increaſes his glory. Friends, family, dependents, and every conſideration of private intereſt, are wholly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorbed in the love of his country. Anxious for the happineſs of thoſe over whom he preſides, he reverences the laws, which he has engaged to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, maintains their ſpirit, and enforces their authority, againſt all oppoſition. In the duties
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:037425_0021_100D2F1A29286468"/>
peculiar to each branch of his public character, he is governed by reaſon, and not by paſſion; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is not raſh and precipitate, but cool and deliberate, in all his meaſures. In one word, in the good man, thus clothed with national autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and moving in the elevated ſphere of its firſt magiſtrate, we behold the genuine patron of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adulterated liberty, ſupported by the unlimited confidence of a watchful and diſcerning public; vindicating the cauſe of the oppreſſed, reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the inſolence of pride and the wantonneſs of power, and filled with the moſt godlike ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; the friend, the guardian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the father, of his country; diſpenſing juſtice and judgment, with an equal hand, and copying the example of God himſelf, in his lenity, beneficence, mercy and love.</p>
            <p>But you may be ready to inquire, whether ſuch a character, merely human, has ever appeared on earth. Shall we meet with it in the annals of Athens or of Rome? In what hiſtory is it to be found? and in what country has it been diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? In anſwer to theſe anxious and very natural inquiries I ſhall only obſerve, that the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:037425_0022_100D40AD9B735800"/>
tidings of this day, which are no leſs affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than true, and which have drawn forth the copious tears of a grateful empire, and diſplay the moſt expreſſive tokens of ſolemn mourning, muſt convince the world, that ſuch a noble, generous and diſintereſted character has exiſted, and has juſt finiſhed its unexampled race of uſefulneſs and glory.</p>
            <p>It is almoſt needleſs to obſerve, that the ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was led to theſe reflections from our common loſs in the death of that truly great and good man, who, under God, effected the independence of theſe United States, and lately preſided at the helm of our general government; whoſe diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed talents and illuſtrious virtues long ſince engaged the warmeſt affections of this enlightened nation, and whoſe reſplendent merits excited the admiration, and extorted the praiſe, of all Europe. And not only ſo, but "their ſound went into <hi>all</hi> the earth, and unto the <hi>ends</hi> of the world."</p>
            <p>When we reflect on his goodneſs, his piety, his firmneſs, wiſdom and prudence;—on his modeſty, benevolence and candour;—on his inceſſant exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the field of glory, his unremitting aſſiduity
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:037425_0023_100D40B051EAB350"/>
in the ſervice of his country, and on the rich and invaluable laurels with which, under God, he crowned her, ſhall we be charged with enthuſiaſm, when we affirm, that a more virtuous patriot, a wiſer ſtateſman, and a greater general, than GEORGE WASHINGTON, never died. Though dead, he yet ſpeaketh;<note n="*" place="bottom">See his FAREWELL ADDRESS to his Country.</note> and while either private or public gratitude remain, <hi>his</hi> name "ſhall be in everlaſting remembrance."</p>
            <p>And may his ſuperior abilities, clear judgment, and illuſtrious virtues, like the mantle of Elijah, long reſt upon the head of our greateſt living bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, his worthy ſucceſſor.</p>
            <p>Now unto GOD, who ſaid unto his anointed ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, Cyrus, "He is my ſhepherd, and ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all my pleaſure," be aſcribed everlaſting praiſes, through JESUS CHRIST our LORD.</p>
