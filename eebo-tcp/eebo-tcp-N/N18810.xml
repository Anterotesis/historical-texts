            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE Editor of this publication hopes, from the eſtabliſhed reputation of the ſeveral tracts of which it is compoſed, that it will be found a more complete ſyſtem for the inſtruction of the female world, than perhaps any other extant.</p>
            <p>A volume under the preſent title was lately publiſhed in England and Ireland, and had a moſt rapid ſale, having been purchaſed by almoſt every lady of taſte in thoſe kingdoms. To this volume, the Editor has added Miſs More's eſſays—Mrs. Chapone's letter on the government of the temper— and Swift's letter to a young lady newly married. Theſe have conſiderably enhanced its value—and he doubts not, the ladies on this ſide the Atlantic will be as generous in their encouragement of a work intended for their advantage, as thoſe in England and Ireland have been.</p>

               <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
               <p>IT is with the utmoſt diffidence that the following pages are ſubmitted to the inſpection of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic: yet, however the limited abilities of the author may have prevented her from ſucceeding to her wiſh, in the execution of her preſent attempt, ſhe humbly truſts that the uprightneſs of her intention will procure it a candid and favourable reception. Theſe little eſſays are chiefly calculated for the younger part of her own ſex, who, ſhe flatters her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, will not eſteem them the leſs, becauſe they were written immediately for their ſervice. She by no means pretends to have compoſed a regular ſyſtem of morals, or a finiſhed plan of conduct: ſhe has only endeavoured to make a few remarks on ſuch circumſtances as ſeemed to her ſuſceptible of ſome improvement, and on ſuch ſubjects as ſhe imagined were particularly intereſting to young ladies, on their firſt introduction into the world. She hopes they will not be offended, if ſhe has occaſionally pointed out certain qualities, and ſuggeſted certain tempers and diſpoſitions, as <hi>peculiarly feminine,</hi> and
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:024452_0004_0FC7451202CF40E8"/>
hazarded ſome obſervations, which naturally aroſe from the ſubject, on the different characters which mark the ſexes. And here again ſhe takes the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to repeat that theſe diſtinctions cannot be too nicely maintained; for beſides thoſe important qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities common to both, each ſex has its reſpective, appropriated qualifications, which would ceaſe to be meritorious, the inſtant they ceaſed to be appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated. Nature, propriety, and cuſtom have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed certain bounds to each; bounds which the prudent and the candid will never attempt to break down; and indeed it would be highly impolitic to annihilate diſtinctions from which each acquires excellence, and to attempt innovations by which both would be loſers.</p>
               <p>Women, therefore, never underſtand their own intereſts ſo little, as when they affect thoſe quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and accompliſhments, from the want of which they derive their higheſt merit. "The <hi>porcelain</hi> clay of human kind," ſays an admired writer, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſex. Greater delicacy evidently implies greater fragility; and this weakneſs, natural and moral, clearly points out the neceſſity of a ſuperior degree of caution, retirement, and reſerve.</p>
               <p>If the author may be allowed to keep up the allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the poet juſt quoted, ſhe would aſk, if we do not put the fineſt vaſes, and the coſtlieſt images in places of the greateſt ſecurity, and moſt remote from any probability of accident or deſtruction? By be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo ſituated, they find their protection in their weakneſs, and their ſafety in their delicacy. This metaphor is far from being uſed with a deſign of placing young ladies in a trivial, unimportant light: it is only introduced to inſinuate, that where there is more beauty, and more weakneſs, there ſhould be greater circumſpection and ſuperior prudence.</p>
               <p>Men, on the contrary, are formed for the more public exhibitions on the great theatre of human life. Like the ſtronger and more ſubſtantial wares, they derive no injury, and loſe no poliſh, by being always expoſed, and engaged in the conſtant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:024452_0005_0FC74516E12346C0"/>
of the world. It is their proper element, where they reſpire their natural air, and exert their nobleſt powers, in ſituations which call them into action. They were intended by Providence for the buſtling ſcenes of life— to appear terrible in arms, uſeful in commerce, ſhining in counſels.</p>
               <p>The author fears it will be hazarding a very bold remark, in the opinion of many ladies, when ſhe adds, that the female mind, in general, does not appear capable of attaining ſo high a degree of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in ſcience, as the male. Yet ſhe hopes to be forgiven, when ſhe obſerves alſo, that as it does not ſeem to derive the chief portion of its excellence from extraordinary abilities of this kind, it is not at all leſſened by the imputation of not poſſeſſing them. It is readily allowed, that the ſex have lively imaginations, and thoſe exquiſite perceptions of the beautiful and defective, which come under the deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of taſte. But pretenſions to that ſtrength of intellect, which is requiſite to penetrate into the abſtruſer walks of literature, it is preſumed they will readily relinquiſh. There are green paſtures, and pleaſant vallies, where they may wander with ſafety to themſelves, and delight to others. They may cultivate the roſes of imagination, and the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable fruits of morals and criticiſm: but the ſteeps of Parnaſſus, few, comparatively, have attempted to ſcale with ſucceſs. And when it is conſidered, that many languages, and many ſciences, muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the perfection of poetical compoſition, it will appear leſs ſtrange. The lofty epic, the point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſatire, and the more daring and ſucceſsful flights of the tragic Muſe, ſeem reſerved for the bold ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers of the other ſex.</p>
               <p>Nor does this aſſertion, it is apprehended, at all injure the intereſts of the women; they have other pretenſions, on which to value themſelves, and other qualities much better calculated to anſwer their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular purpoſes. We are enamoured of the ſoft ſtrains of the Sicilian and the Mantuan Muſe, while, to the ſweet notes of the paſtoral reed, they ſing
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:024452_0006_0FC7451877D75960"/>
the contentions of the ſhepherds, the bleſſings of love, or the innocent delights of rural life. Has it ever been aſcribed to them as a defect, that their eclog<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es do not treat of active ſcenes, of buſy cities, and of waſting war? No: their ſimplicity is their perfection; and they are only blamed when they have too little of it.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, the lofty bards, who ſtrung their bolder harps to higher meaſures, and ſung the <hi>Wrath</hi> of <hi>Peleus' ſon,</hi> and <hi>Man's firſt diſobedience,</hi> have never been cenſured for want of ſweetneſs and refinement. The ſublime, the nervous, and the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine, characteriſe their compoſitions; as the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, the ſoft, and the delicate, mark thoſe of the others. Grandeur, dignity, and force, diſtinguiſh the one ſpecies; eaſe, ſimplicity, and purity the other. Both ſhine from their native, diſtinct, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borrowed merits, not from thoſe which are foreign, adventitious, and unnatural. Yet thoſe excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, which make up the eſſential and conſtituent parts of poetry, they have in common.</p>
               <p>Women have generally quicker perceptions: men have juſter ſentiments.—Women conſider how things may be prettily ſaid; men how they may be proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid.—In women, (young ones at leaſt) ſpeaking accompanies, and ſometimes precedes reflexion; in men, reflexion is the antecedent.—Women ſpeak to ſhine or to pleaſe; men, to convince or confute.— Women admire what is brilliant; men what is ſolid. Women prefer an extemporaneous ſally of wit, or a ſparkling effuſion of fancy, before the moſt accurate reaſoning, or the moſt laborious inveſtigations of facts. In literary compoſition, women are pleaſed with point, turn, and antitheſis; men with obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a juſt deduction of effects from their cauſes. Women are fond of incident, men of argument.— Women admire paſſionately; men approve cautiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.—One ſex will think it betrays a want of feeling to be moderate in their applauſe; the other will be afraid of expoſing a want of judgment by being in raptures with any thing.—Men refuſe to give way to
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:024452_0007_0FC7451AC8076F68"/>
the emotions they actually feel, while women ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times affect to be tranſported beyond what the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion will juſtify.</p>
               <p>As a farther confirmation of what has been advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the different bent of the underſtanding in the ſexes, it may be obſerved, that we have heard of many female wits, but never of one female logici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an—of many admirable writers of memoirs, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of one chronologer.—In the boundleſs and aeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al regions of romance, and in that faſhionable ſpecies of compoſition which ſucceeded it, and which carries a nearer approximation to the manners of the world, the women cannot be excelled: this imaginary ſoil they have a peculiar talent for cultivating; becauſe here,
<q>Invention labours more, and judgment leſs.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The merit of this kind of writing conſiſts in the <hi>vrai-ſemblance</hi> to real life, as to the events them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, with a certain elevation in the narrative, which places them, if not above what is natural, yet above what is common. It farther conſiſts in the art of intereſting the tender feelings, by a pathetic re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of thoſe minute, endearing, domeſtic circumſtances, which take captive the ſoul before it has time to ſhield itſelf with the armour of reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. To amuſe, rather than to inſtruct, or to inſtruct indirectly by ſhort inferences, drawn from a long concatenation of circumſtances, is at once the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this ſort of compoſition, and one of the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtics of female genius<note n="*" place="bottom">The author does not apprehend it makes againſt her GENERAL poſition, that this nation can boaſt a female critic, poet, hiſtorian, linguiſt, philoſopher, and moraliſt, equal to moſt of the other ſex. To theſe particular inſtances others might be adduced; but it is preſumed, that they only ſtand as excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt the rule, without tending to invalidate the rule itſelf.</note>.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, it appears that the mind in each ſex has ſome natural kind of bias, which conſtitutes a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:024452_0008_0FC7451EFB95EFD0"/>
of character, and that the happineſs of both depends, in a great meaſure, on the preſervation and obſervance of this diſtinction. For where would be the ſuperior pleaſure and ſatisfaction reſulting from mixed converſation, if this difference were aboliſhed?

               <p>AS an argument in favour of modern manners, it has been pleaded, that the ſofter vices of luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and diſſipation, belong rather to gentle and yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tempers, than to ſuch as are rugged and feroci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: that they are vices which increaſe civilization, and tend to promote refinement, and the cultivation of humanity.</p>

               <p>The love of diſſipation is, I believe, allowed to be the reigning evil of the preſent day. It is an evil which many content themſelves with regretting, without ſeeking to redreſs. A diſſipated life is cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured in the very act of diſſipation; and prodigality of time is as gravely declaimed againſt at the card table, as in the pulpit.</p>

               <p>In ſhort, every one ſeems convinced, that the evil ſo much complained of does really exiſt ſomewhere, though all are inwardly perſuaded that it is not with themſelves. All deſire a general reformation; but few will liſten to propoſals of particular amendment; the body muſt be reſtored, but each limb begs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main as it is; and accuſations, which concern all, will be likely to affect none. They think that ſin, like matter, is diviſible, and that what is ſcattered among ſo many, cannot materially affect any one; and thus individuals contribute ſeparately to that evil which they in general lament.</p>
               <p>The prevailing manners of an age depend more than we are aware, or are willing to allow, on the conduct of the women; this is one of the principal hinges on which the great machine of human ſociety turns. Thoſe, who allow the influence which female

How much then is it to be regretted, that the ladies ſhould ever ſit down contented to poliſh, when they are able to reform—to entertain, when they might inſtruct, and to dazzle for an hour, when they are candidates for eternity!</p>

She who dedicates a portion of her lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to uſeful reading, feels her mind in a conſtant progreſſive ſtate of improvement, while the mind of a diſſiputed woman is continually loſing ground. An active ſpirit rejoiceth, like the ſun, to run his daily courſe, while indolence, like the dial of Ahaz, goes backwards. The advantages which the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing receives from polite literature, it is not here neceſſary to enumerate; its effects on the moral tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is the preſent object of conſideration. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark may perhaps be thought too ſtrong, but I believe it is true, that, next to religious influences, an habit of ſtudy is the moſt probable preſervative of the virtue of young perſons. Thoſe who cultivate letters have rarely a ſtrong paſſion for promiſcuous viſiting, or diſſipated ſociety: ſtudy, therefore, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces a reliſh for domeſtic life, the moſt deſirable temper in the world for women.

What the preſent age has gained on one ſide, by a more enlarged and liberal way of thinking, ſeems to be loſt on the other, by exceſſive freedom and unbounded indulgence. Knowledge is not, as heretofore, confined to the dull cloyſter, or the gloomy college, but diſſeminated, to a certain degree, among both ſexes and almoſt all ranks. The only misfortune is, that theſe opportunities do not ſeem to be ſo wiſely improved, or turned to ſo good an account as might be wiſhed. Books of a pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, idle, and frivolous ſort, are too much multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and it is from the very redundancy of them, that true knowledge is ſo ſcarce, and the habit of diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo much increaſed.</p>
               <p>It has been remarked, that the prevailing charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the preſent age is not that of groſs immorality: but if this is meant of thoſe in the higher walks of life, it is eaſy to diſcern, that there can be but little merit in abſtaining from crimes which there is but little temptation to commit. It is, however, to be feared, that a gradual defection from piety, will in time draw after it all the bad conſequences of more active vice; for whether mounds and fences are ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly deſtroyed by a ſweeping torrent, or worn away through gradual neglect, the effect is equally deſtructive.

               <p>The philoſophical doctrine of the ſlow receſſion of bodies from the ſun, is a lively image of the reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with which we firſt abandon the light of virtue. The beginning of folly, and the firſt entrance on a

diſſipated life, coſt ſome pangs to a well diſpoſed heart; but it is ſurpriſing to ſee how ſoon the progreſs ceaſes to be impeded by reflexion, or ſlackened by remorſe. For it is in moral as in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural things; the motion in minds as well as bodies is accelerated by a nearer approach to the centre, to which they are tending. If we recede ſlowly at firſt ſetting out, we advance rapidly in our future courſe: and to have begun to be wrong, is already to have made a great progreſs.</p>
               <p>A conſtant habit of amuſement relaxes the tone of the mind, and renders it totally incapable of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, ſtudy, or virtue. Diſſipation not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſes its votaries to every thing uſeful and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, but diſqualifies them for the enjoyment of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure itſelf. It ſoftens the ſoul ſo much, that the moſt ſuperficial employment becomes a labour, and the ſlighteſt inconvenience an agony. The luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sybarite muſt have loſt all ſenſe of real enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and all reliſh for true gratification, before he complained that he could not ſleep, becauſe the roſe-leaves lay double under him.</p>
               <p>Luxury and diſſipation, ſoft and gentle as their approaches are, and ſilently as they throw their ſilken chains about the heart, enſlave it more than the moſt active and turbulent vices.

And this opinion is confirmed by a great modern<note n="*" place="bottom">Lord Bacon.</note>, in the following little anecdote from one of the ancients:</p>
               <p>When many Grecian philoſophers had a ſolemn meeting before the ambaſſador of a foreign prince, each endeavoured to ſhow his parts by the brilliancy of his converſation, that the ambaſſador might have ſomething to relate of the Grecian wiſdom. One of them, offended, no doubt, at the loquacity of his companions, obſerved a profound ſilence; when the ambaſſador, turning to him, aſked,
<q>But what have you to ſay, that I may report it?</q>
He made this laconic, but very pointed reply:
<q>Tell your king that you have found one among the Greeks who knew how to be ſilent.</q>
               </p>
               <p>There is a quality infinitely more intoxicating to the female mind than knowledge; this is wit, the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:024452_0019_0FC7454ABA6259A0"/>
moſt captivating, but the moſt dreaded of all talents: the moſt dangerous to thoſe who have it, and the moſt feared by thoſe who have it not. Though it is againſt all the rules, yet I cannot find in my heart to abuſe this charming quality. He who is grown rich with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, in ſafe and ſober dulneſs, ſhuns it as a diſeaſe, and looks upon poverty as its invariable concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant. The moraliſt declaims againſt it, as the ſource of irregularity; and the frugal citizen dreads it more than bankruptcy itſelf; for he conſiders it as the parent of extravagance and beggary. The cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic will aſk of what uſe it is? Of very little per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps: no more is a flower garden, and yet it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed as an object of innocent amuſement and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful recreation. A woman who poſſeſſes this quality, has received a moſt dangerous preſent, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not leſs ſo than beauty itſelf: eſpecially if it be not ſheathed in a temper peculiarly inoffenſive, chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed by a moſt correct judgment, and reſtrained by more prudence than falls to the common lot.</p>
               <p>This talent is more likely to make a woman vain than knowledge; for as wit is the immediate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of its poſſeſſor, and learning is only an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the knowledge of other people, there is much more danger, that we ſhould be vain of what is our own, than of what we borrow.</p>
               <p>But wit, like learning, is not near ſo common a thing as is imagined. Let not, therefore, a young lady be alarmed at the acuteneſs of her own wit, any more than at the abundance of her own knowledge. The great danger is, leſt ſhe ſhould miſtake pertneſs, flippancy, or imprudence, for this brilliant quality, or imagine ſhe is witty, only becauſe ſhe is indiſcreet. This is very frequently the caſe; and this makes the name of wit ſo cheap, while its real exiſtence is ſo rare.</p>
               <p>Leſt the flattery of her acquaintance, or an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weening opinion of her own qualifications, ſhould lead ſome vain and petulant girl into a falſe notion that ſhe has a great deal of wit, when ſhe has only a redundancy of animal ſpirits, ſhe may not find it uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs

               <p>But thoſe who actually poſſeſs this rare talent, cannot be too abſtinent in the uſe of it. It often makes admirers, but it never makes friends; I mean, where it is the predominant feature; and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>protected and defenceleſs ſtate of womanhood calls for friendſhip more than for admiration. She who does not deſire friends, has a ſordid and inſenſible ſoul; but ſhe who is ambitious of making every man her admirer, has an invincible vanity, and a cold heart.</p>
               <p>But to dwell only on the ſide of policy, a prudent woman, who has eſtabliſhed the reputation of ſome genius, will ſufficiently maintain it, without keeping her faculties always on the ſtretch, to ſay <hi>good things.</hi> Nay, if reputation alone be her object, ſhe will gain a more ſolid one by her forbearance; as the wiſer part of her acquaintance will aſcribe it to the right motive, which is, not that ſhe has leſs wit, but that ſhe has more judgment.</p>

               <p>I have always been delighted with the ſtory of the little girl's eloquence, in one of the children's tales, who received from a friendly fairy the gift, that at every word ſhe uttered, pinks, roſes, diamonds, and pearls, ſhould drop from her mouth. The hidden moral appears to be this, that it was the ſweetneſs of her temper which produced this pretty fanciful effect: for when her malicious ſiſter deſired the ſame gift from the good natured tiny intelligence, the venom of her own heart converted it into poiſonous and loathſome reptiles.</p>
               <p>A man of ſenſe and breeding will ſometimes join in the laugh, which has been raiſed at his expenſe, by an ill-natured repartee: but if it was very cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and one of that ſhocking ſort of truths, which, as they can ſcarcely be pardoned even in private, ought never to be uttered in public, he does not laugh becauſe he is pleaſed, but becauſe he wiſhes to conceal how much he is hurt. As the ſarcaſm was uttered by a lady, ſo far from ſeeming to reſent it, he will be the firſt to commend it; but nothwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that, he will remember it as a trait of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, when the whole company ſhall have forgotten
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:024452_0022_0FC7455777583A68"/>
it as a ſtroke of wit. Women are ſo far from being privileged by their ſex to ſay unhandſome or cruel things, that this is the very circumſtance which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them more intolerable. When the arrow is lodged in the heart, it is no relief to him who is wounded, to reflect, that the hand which ſhot him was a fair one.</p>
               <p>Many women, when they have a favourite point to gain, or an earneſt wiſh to bring any one over to their opinion, often uſe a very diſingenuous method: they will ſtate a caſe ambiguouſly, and then avail themſelves of it, in whatever manner ſhall beſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer their purpoſe; leaving your mind in a ſtate of indeciſion as to their real meaning, while they tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in the perplexity they have given you, by the unfair concluſions they draw, from premiſes equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally ſtated. They will alſo frequently argue from exceptions inſtead of rules, and are aſtoniſhed when you are not willing to be contented with a preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, inſtead of a reaſon.</p>
               <p>In a ſenſible company of both ſexes, where women are not reſtrained by any other reſerve than what their natural modeſty impoſes—and where the inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy of all parties authoriſes the utmoſt freedom of communication—ſhould any one enquire what were the general ſentiments on ſome particular ſubject, it will, I believe, commonly happen that the ladies, whoſe imaginations have kept pace with the narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, have anticipated its end, and are ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver their ſentiments on it, as ſoon as it is finiſhed. While ſome of the male hearers, whoſe minds were buſied in ſettling the propriety, comparing the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and examining the conſiſtencies of what was ſaid are obliged to pauſe and diſcriminate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they think of anſwering. Nothing is ſo em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſing as a variety of matter; and the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of women is often more perſpicuous, becauſe it is leſs laboured.</p>
               <p>A man of deep reflexion, if he does not keep up an intimate commerce with the world, will be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo entangled in the intricacies of intenſe

thought, that he will have the appearance of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed and perplexed expreſſion; while a ſprightly woman will extricate herſelf with that lively and "raſh dexterity," which will almoſt always pleaſe, though it is very far from being always right. It is eaſier to confound than to convince an opponent; the former may be effected by a turn that has more happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs than truth in it. Many an excellent reaſoner, well ſkilled in the theory of the ſchools, has felt himſelf diſcomfited by a reply, which, though as wide of the mark, and as foreign to the queſtion, as can be conceived, has diſconcerted him more than the moſt ſtartling propoſiton, or the moſt accurate chain of reaſoning could have done; and he has borne the laugh of his fair antagoniſt, as well as of the whole company, though he could not but feel, that his own argument was attended with the fulleſt demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: ſo true it is, that it is not always neceſſary to be right, in order to be applauded.</p>
               <p>But let not a young lady's vanity be too much elated with this falſe applauſe, which is given, not to merit, but to her ſex: ſhe has not, perhaps, gained a victory, though ſhe may be allowed a triumph; and it ſhould humble her to reflect, that the tribute is paid, not to her ſtrength, but to her weakneſs. It is worth while to diſcriminate between that applauſe, which is given from the complaiſance of others, and that which is paid to our own merit.</p>
               <p>Where great ſprightlineſs is the natural bent of the temper, girls ſhould endeavour to habituate themſelves to a cuſtom of obſerving, thinking, and reaſoning. I do not mean that they ſhould devote themſelves to abſtruſe ſpeculation, or the ſtudy of logic; but ſhe, who is accuſtomed to give a due ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement to her thoughts, to reaſon juſtly and pertinently, on common affairs, and judiciouſly to deduce effects from their cauſes, will be a better logician tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the ſex. That ſpecies of knowledge, which appears to be the reſult of reflexion rather than of ſcience, ſits peculiarly well on women. It is not uncommon to find a lady, who, though ſhe does not know a rule of ſyntax, ſcarcely ever violates one; and who conſtucts every ſentence ſhe utters, with more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety than many a learned dunce, who has every rule of Ariſtotle by heart, and who can lace his own thread-bare diſcourſe with the golden ſhreds of Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro and Virgil.</p>
               <p>It has been objected, and I fear with ſome reaſon, that female converſation is too frequently tinctured with a cenſorious ſpirit, and that ladies are ſeldom apt to diſcover much tenderneſs for the errors of a fallen ſiſter.
<q>If it be ſo, it is a grievous fault.</q>
No arguments can juſtify, no pleas can extenuate it To exult over the miſeries of an unhappy creature is inhuman: not to compaſſionate them is unchriſtian. The worthy part of the ſex always expreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves humanely on the failings of others, in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their own undeviating goodneſs.</p>
               <p>And here I cannot help remarking, that young women do not always carefully diſtinguiſh between running into the error of detraction, and its oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite extreme of indiſcriminate applauſe. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the falſe idea they entertain, that the direct contrary to what is wrong, muſt be right. Thus the dread of being only ſuſpected of one fault, makes them actually guilty of another. The deſire of avoiding the imputation of envy, impels them to be inſincere; and to eſtabliſh a reputation for ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of temper and generoſity, they affect ſometimes to ſpeak of very indifferent characters with the moſt extravagant applauſe. With ſuch the hyperbole is a favourite figure; and every degree of compariſon, but the ſuperlative, is rejected, as cold and inexpreſſive. But this habit of exaggeration greatly weakens their credit, and deſtroys the weight of their opinion on other occaſions; for people very ſoon diſcover what
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:024452_0025_0FC7456E069472C0"/>
degree of faith is to be given both to their judgment and veracity. And thoſe of real merit will no more be flattered by that approbation, which cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh the value of what it praiſes, than the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated painter muſt have been at the judgment paſſed on his works by an ignorant ſpectator, who, being aſked what he thought of ſuch and ſuch very capital but very different pieces, cried out in an affected rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, "All alike! all alike!"</p>
               <p>It has been propoſed to the young, as a maxim of ſupreme wiſdom, to manage ſo dexterouſly in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, as to appear to be well acquainted with ſubjects, of which they are totally ignorant; and this, by affecting ſilence in regard to thoſe, on which they are known to excel.—But why counſel this diſinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous fraud? Why add to the numberleſs arts of deceit, this practice of deceiving, as it were, on a ſettled principle? If to diſavow the knowledge they really have, be a culpable affectation, then certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to inſinuate an idea of their ſkill where they are actually ignorant, is a moſt unworthy artifice.</p>
               <p>But of all the qualifications for converſation, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, if not the moſt brilliant, is the ſafeſt, the moſt amiable, and the moſt feminine. The affectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of introducing ſubjects, with which others are unacquainted, and of diſplaying talents ſuperior to the reſt of the company, is as dangerous as it is fooliſh.</p>
               <p>There are many, who never can forgive another for being more agreeable and more accompliſhed than themſelves, and who can pardon any offence rather than an eclipſing merit. Had the nightingale in the fable conquered his vanity, and reſiſted the temptation of ſhowing a fine voice, he might have eſcaped the talons of the hawk. The melody of his ſinging was the cauſe of his deſtruction; his merit brought him into danger, and his vanity coſt him his life.</p>

               <p>"ENVY," ſays Lord Bacon, "has no holidays." There cannot, perhaps, be a more lively and ſtriking deſcription of the miſerable ſtate of mind thoſe endure, who are tormented with this vice. A ſpirit of emulation has been ſuppoſed to be the ſource of the greateſt improvements; and there is no doubt but the warmeſt rivalſhip will produce the moſt excellent effects; but it is to be feared, that a perpetual ſtate of conteſt will injure the temper ſo eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially, that the miſchief will hardly be counter-balanced by any other advantages. Thoſe, whoſe progreſs is the moſt rapid, will be apt to deſpiſe their leſs ſucceſsful competitors, who, in return, will feel the bittereſt reſentment againſt their more fortunate rivals. Among perſons of real goodneſs, this jealouſy and contempt can never be equally felt; becauſe every advancement in piety will be attended with a proportionable encreaſe of humility, which will lead them to contemplate their own improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with modeſty, and to view with charity the miſcarriages of others.</p>
               <p>When an envious man is melancholy, one may aſk him, in the words of Bion, what evil has befallen himſelf, or what good has happened to another? This laſt is the ſcale by which he principally mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures his felicity, and the very ſmiles of his friends are ſo many deductions from his own happineſs. The wants of others are the ſtandard by which he rates his own wealth; and he eſtimates his riches not ſo much by his own poſſeſſions, as by the neceſſities of his neighbours.</p>

The rage of the paſſionate man is totally extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by the death of his enemy: but the hatred of the malicious is not buried even in the grave of his rival: he will envy the good name he has left behind him; he will envy him the tears of his wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and the proſperity of his children, the eſteem of his friends, the praiſes of his epitaph—nay, the very magnificence of his funeral.</p>

               <p>When you tell thoſe of a malicious turn, any cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance that has happened to another, though they perfectly know of whom you are ſpeaking, they often affect to be at a loſs, to forget his name, or to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehend you in ſome reſpect or other; and this,

merely to have an apportunity of ſlily gratifying their malice, by mentioning ſome unhappy defect or perſonal infirmity he labours under; and not content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed "to tack his every error to his name," they will by way of farther explanation, have recourſe to the faults of his father, or the misfortunes of his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and this, with all the ſeeming ſimplicity and candour in the world, merely for the ſake of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting miſtakes, and to clear up every doubt of his identy.—If you are ſpeaking of a lady, for inſtance, they will perhaps embelliſh their enquiries, by aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if you mean her, whoſe great grandfather was a bankrupt, though ſhe has the vanity to keep a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, while others who are much better born walk on foot; for they will afterwards recollect, that you may poſſibly mean her couſin, of the ſame name, whoſe mother was ſuſpected of ſuch or ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretion, though the daughter had the luck to make her fortune by marrying, while her betters are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked.</p>
               <p>To <hi>hint at a fault,</hi> does more miſchief than ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out; for whatever is left for the imagination to finiſh, will not fail to be overdone: every hiatus will be more than filled up, and every pauſe more than ſupplied. There is leſs malice, and leſs miſchief too, in telling a man's name, than the initials of it; as a worthier perſon may be involved in the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful ſuſpicions by ſuch a dangerous ambiguity.</p>
               <p>It is not uncommon for the envious, after having attempted to deface the faireſt character ſo induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, that they are afraid you will begin to detect their malice, to endeavour to remove your ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons effectually, by aſſuring you, that
<q>what they have juſt related is only the popular opinion; they themſelves can never believe things are ſo bad as they are ſaid to be; for their part, it is a rule with them always to hope the beſt. It is their way never to believe or report ill of any one.

An <hi>if,</hi> or a <hi>but,</hi> or a mortified look, or a languid defence, or an ambiguous ſhake of the head, or a haſty word affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly recalled, will demoliſh a character more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually, than the whole artillery of malice, when openly levelled againſt it.</p>
               <p>It is not that envy never praiſes: No, that would be making a public profeſſion of itſelf, and advertiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its own malignity; whereas the greateſt ſucceſs of its efforts depends on the concealment of their end. When envy intends to ſtrike a ſtroke of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiavelian policy, it ſometimes affects the language of the moſt exaggerated applauſe; though it gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally takes care, that the ſubject of its panegyric ſhall be a very indifferent and common character, ſo that it is well aware none of its praiſes will ſtick.</p>
               <p>It is the unhappy nature of envy not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with poſitive miſery, but to be continually ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating its own torments, by comparing them with the felicities of others. The eyes of envy are perpetually fixed on the object which diſturbs it, nor can it avert them from it, though to procure itſelf the relief of a temporary forgetfulneſs.

               <p>As this enormous ſin chiefly inſtigated the revolt, and brought on the ruin, of the angelic ſpirits, ſo it is not improbable, that it will be a principal inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of miſery in a future world, for the envious to compare their deſperate condition with the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the children of God, and to heighten their actual wretchedneſs by reflecting on what they have loſt.</p>
               <p>Perhaps envy, like lying and ingratitude, is prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed with more frequency, becauſe it is practiſed with impunity; but there being no human laws a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe crimes, is ſo far from an inducement to

commit them, that this very conſideration would be ſufficient to deter the wiſe and good, if all others were ineffectual; for of how heinous a nature muſt thoſe ſins be, which are judged above the reach of human puniſhment, and are reſerved for the final juſtice of God himſelf!</p>

               <p>Error is never likely to do ſo much miſchief, as when it diſguiſes its real tendency, and puts on an engaging and attractive appearance. Many a young woman, who would be ſhocked at the imputation of an intrigue, is extremely flattered at the idea of a ſentimental connexion, though perhaps with a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and deſigning man, who, by putting on this maſk of plauſibility and virtue, diſarms her of her prudence, lays her apprehenſions aſleep, and involves her in miſery— miſery the more inevitable, becauſe
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:024452_0032_0FC7459145B40D70"/>
unſuſpected. For ſhe who apprehends no danger, will not think it neceſſary to be always upon her guard; but will rather invite than avoid the ruin, which comes under ſo ſpecious and ſo fair a form.</p>
               <p>Such an engagement will be infinitely dearer to her vanity, than an avowed and authorized attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for one of theſe ſentimental lovers will not ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple very ſeriouſly to aſſure a credulous girl, that her unparalleled merit entitles her to the adoration of the whole world, and that the univerſal homage of mankind is nothing more than the unavoidable tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute extorted by her charms. No wonder then ſhe ſhould be ſo eaſily prevailed on to believe, that an individual is captivated by perfections which might enſlave a million. But ſhe ſhould remember, that he, who endeavours to intoxicate her with adulation, intends one day moſt effectually to humble her. For an artful man has always a ſecret deſign to pay him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in future for every preſent ſacrifice. And this prodigality of praiſe, which he now appears to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh with ſuch thoughtleſs profuſion, is, in fact, a ſum economically laid out to ſupply his future neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities: of this ſum he keeps an exact eſtimate, and at ſome diſtant day promiſes himſelf the moſt exorbitant intereſt for it. If he has addreſs and conduct, and the object of his purſuit much vanity, and ſome ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, he ſeldom fails of ſucceſs; for ſo powerful will be his aſcendency over her mind, that ſhe will ſoon adopt his notions and opinions. Indeed it is more than probable ſhe poſſeſſed moſt of them before, having gradually acquired them in her initiation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſentimental character. To maintain that cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter with dignity and propriety, it is neceſſary ſhe ſhould entertain the moſt elevated ideas of diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate alliances, and diſintereſted love; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider fortune, rank, and reputation, as mere chime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical diſtinctions and vulgar prejudices.</p>
               <p>The lover, deeply verſed in all the obliquities of fraud, and ſkilled to wind himſelf into every avenue of the heart, which indiſcretion has left unguarded, ſoon diſcovers on which ſide it is moſt acceſſible. He
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:024452_0033_0FC7459F2F09FE00"/>
avails himſelf of this weakneſs by addreſſing her in a language exactly conſonant to her own ideas. He attacks her with her own weapons, and oppoſes rhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſody to ſentiment. He profeſſes ſo ſovereign a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt for the paltry concerns of money, that ſhe thinks it her duty to reward him for ſo generous a renunciation. Every plea he artfully advances of his own unworthineſs, is conſidered by her as a freſh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, which her gratitude muſt anſwer. And ſhe makes it a point of honour to ſacrifice to him that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune which he is too noble to regard. Theſe profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of humility are the common artifice of the vain; and theſe proteſtations of generoſity the refuge of the rapacious. And among its many ſmooth miſchiefs, it is one of the ſure and ſucceſsful frauds of ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to affect the moſt frigid indifference to thoſe external and pecuniary advantages, which it is its great and real object to obtain.</p>
               <p>A ſentimental girl very rarely entertains any doubt of her perſonal beauty; for ſhe has been daily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to contemplate it herſelf, and to hear of it from others. She will not therefore be very ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous for the confirmation of a truth ſo ſelf-evident; but ſhe ſuſpects, that her pretenſions to underſtanding are more likely to be diſputed, and, for that reaſon, greedily devours every compliment offered to thoſe perfections, which are leſs obvious and more refined. She is perſuaded that men need only open their eyes to decide on her beauty, while it will be the moſt convincing proof of the taſte, ſenſe, and elegance of her admirer, that he can diſcern and flatter thoſe qualities in her. A man of the character here ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, will eaſily inſinuate himſelf into her affections, by means of this latent but leading foible, which may be called the guiding clue to a ſentimental heart. He will affect to overlook that beauty which attracts common eyes, and enſnares common hearts, while he will beſtow the moſt delicate praiſes on the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of her mind, and finiſh the climax of adulation, by hinting that ſhe is ſuperior to it.</p>

               </q>
               <p>But nothing, in general, can end leſs delightful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than theſe ſublime attachments, even where no acts of ſeduction are ever practiſed, but they are ſuffered, like mere ſublunary connexions, to terminate in the vulgar cataſtrophe of marriage. That wealth, which lately ſeemed to be looked on with ineffable contempt by the lover, now appears to be the principal attraction in the eyes of the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band: and he, who but a few ſhort weeks before, in a tranſport of ſentimental generoſity, wiſhed her to have been a village maid, with no portion but her crook and her beauty, and that they might ſpend their days in paſtoral love and innocence, has now loſt all reliſh for the Arcadian life, or any other life in which ſhe muſt be his companion.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, ſhe who was lately
<q>An angel call'd, and angel-like ador'd,</q>
is ſhocked to find herſelf at once ſtripped of all her celeſtial attributes. This late divinity, who ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yielded to her ſiſters of the ſky, now finds herſelf of leſs importance in the eſteem of the man ſhe has choſen, than any other mere mortal woman. No lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is ſhe gratified with the tear of counterfeited paſſion, the ſigh of diſſembled rapture, or the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of premeditated adoration. No longer is the altar of her vanity loaded with the oblations of fic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious fondneſs, the incenſe of falſehood, or the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of flattery.—Her apotheoſis is ended! She feels herſelf degraded from the dignities and privileges of a goddeſs, to all the imperfections, vanities, and weakneſſes of a ſlighted woman, and a neglected wife. Her faults, which were ſo lately overlooked, or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken for virtues, are now, as Caſſius ſays, ſet in a note-book. The paſſion, which was vowed eternal, laſted only a few ſhort weeks, and the indifference, which was ſo far from being included in the bargain, that it was not ſo much as ſuſpected, follows them

through the whole tireſome journey of their inſipid, vacant, joyleſs exiſtence.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the <hi>completion</hi> of the ſentimental hiſtory. If we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ace it back to its beginning, we ſhall find, that a damſel of this caſt had her head ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally turned by pernicious reading, and her inſani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty confirmed by imprudent friendſhips. She never fails to ſelect a beloved <hi>confidante</hi> of her own turn and humour, though, if ſhe can help it, not quite ſo handſome as herſelf. A violent intimacy enſues, or, to ſpeak the language of ſentiment, an intimate union of ſouls immediately takes place, which is wrought to the higheſt pitch, by a ſecret and voluminous correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, though they live in the ſame ſtreet, or perhaps in the ſame houſe. This is the fuel which principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feeds and ſupplies the dangerous flame of ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In this correſpondence the two friends encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage each other in the falſeſt notions imaginable. They repreſent romantic love as the great important buſineſs of human life, and deſcribe all the other concerns of it as too low and paltry to merit the attention of ſuch elevated beings, and fit only to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy the daughters of the plodding vulgar. In theſe letters, family affairs are miſrepreſented, family ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets divulged, and family misfortunes aggravated. They are filled with vows of eternal amity, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations of never-ending love. But interjections and quotations are the principal embelliſhments of theſe very ſublime epiſtles. Every panegyric con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in them is extravagant and hyperbolical, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very cenſure exaggerated and exceſſive. In a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite, every frailty is heightened into a perfection, and in a foe, degraded into a crime. The dramatic poets, eſpecially the moſt tender and romantic, are quoted in almoſt every line, and every pompous or pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic thought is forced to give up its natural and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious meaning, and, with all the violence of miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, is compelled to ſuit ſome circumſtance of imaginary woe of the fair tranſcriber. Alicia is not too mad for her heroics, nor Monimia too mild for her ſoft emotions.</p>

For a favourite topic of theſe epiſtles is the groveling ſpirit and ſordid temper of the parents, who will be ſure to find no quarter at the hands of their daughters, ſhould they preſume to be ſo unreaſonable as to direct their courſe of reading, interfere in their choice of friends, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt their very important correſpondence. But as theſe young ladies are fertile in expedients, and as their genius is never more agreeably exerciſed than in finding reſources, they are not without their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret exultation, in caſe either of the above intereſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting events ſhould happen, as they carry with them a certain air of tyranny and perſecution which is very delightful. For a prohibited correſpondence is one of the great incidents of a ſentimental life— and a letter clandeſtinely received, the ſupreme fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity of a ſentimental lady.</p>
               <p>Nothing can equal the aſtoniſhment of theſe ſoar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirits, when their plain friends or prudent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations preſume to remonſtrate with them on any impropriety in their conduct. But if theſe worthy people happen to be ſomewhat advanced in life, their contempt is then a little ſoftened by pity, at the reflexion that ſuch very antiquated, poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſhould pretend to judge what is fit or unfit for ladies of their great refinement, ſenſe, and reading. They conſider them as wretches utterly ignorant of the ſublime pleaſures of a delicate and exalted paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as tyrants whoſe authority is to be contemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and as ſpies whoſe vigilance is to be eluded. The prudence of theſe worthy friends they term ſuſpicion, and their experience dotage. For they are perſuaded, that the face of things has ſo totally changed, ſince their parents were young, that though they might then judge tolerably for themſelves, yet they are now (with all their advantages of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and obſervation) by no means qualified to direct their more enlightened daughters; who, if they have made a great progreſs in the ſentimental walk, will
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:024452_0037_0FC745ADBAFAA9D0"/>
be no more influenced by the advice of their mother, than they would go abroad in her laced pinner, or her brocade ſuit.</p>
               <p>But young people never ſhow their folly and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance more conſpicuouſly, than by this over confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in their own judgment, and this haughty diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain of the opinion of thoſe who have known more days. Youth has a quickneſs of apprehenſion, which it is very apt to miſtake for an acuteneſs of penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But youth, like cunning, though very conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is very ſhort-ſighted, and never more ſo than when it diſregards the inſtructions of the wiſe, and the admonitions of the aged. The ſame vices and follies influenced the human heart in their day, which influence it now, and nearly in the ſame manner. One, who well knew the world and its various vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, has ſaid:
<q>The thing which hath been, it is that which ſhall be, and that which is done is that which ſhall be done, and there is no new thing under the ſun.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is alſo a part of the ſentimental character, to imagine that none but the young and the beautiful have any right to the pleaſures of ſociety, or even to the common benefits and bleſſings of life. Ladies of this turn alſo affect the moſt lofty diſregard for uſeful qualities and domeſtic virtues; and this is a natural conſequence; for as this ſort of ſentiment is only a word for idleneſs, ſhe who is conſtantly and uſefully employed, has neither leiſure nor propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to cultivate it.</p>
               <p>A ſentimental lady principally values herſelf on the enlargement of her notions, and her liberal way of thinking. This ſuperiority of ſoul chiefly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts itſelf in the contempt of theſe minute delicacies and little decorums, which, trifling as they may be thought, tend at once to dignify the character, and to reſtrain the levity of the younger part of the ſex.</p>
               <p>Perhaps the error here complained of, originates in miſtaking <hi>ſentiment</hi> and <hi>principle</hi> for each other. Now I conc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm is ſo far from being diſagreeable, that a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it is perhaps indiſpenſably neceſſary in an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging woman.

I will even go ſo far as to aſſert, that a young woman cannot have any real greatneſs of ſoul, or true clevation of principle, if ſhe has not a tinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of what the vulgar would call Romance, but which perſons of a certain way of thinking will diſcern to p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But this dangerous merit cannot be too rigidly watched, as it is very apt to lead thoſe who poſſeſs it into inconveniences from which leſs intereſting characters are happily exempt.

                  </gap>rming ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes. Their taſtes are paſſions. They love and
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:024452_0041_0FC746714A175020"/>
hate with all their hearts, and ſcarcely ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to feel a reaſonable preference, before it ſtrengthens into a violent attachment.</p>
               <p>When an innocent girl, of this open, truſting, tender heart, happens to meet with one of her own ſex and age, whoſe addreſs and manners are engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhe is inſtantly ſeized with an ardent deſire to commence a friendſhip with her. She feels the moſt lively impatience at the reſtraints of company, and the decorums of ceremony. She longs to be alone with her, longs to aſſure her of the warmth of her tenderneſs, and generouſly aſcribes to the fair ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger all the good qualities ſhe feels in her own heart, or ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>her all thoſe which ſhe has met with, in her reading, diſperſed in a variety of heroines. She is perſuaded, that her new friend unites them all in herſelf, becauſe ſhe carries in her prepoſſeſſing coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance the promiſe of them all. How cruel and how cenſorious would this inexperienced girl think her mother was, who ſhould venture to hint, that the agreeable unknown had defects in her temper, or exceptions in her character! She would miſtake theſe hints of diſcretion for the inſinuations of an uncharitable diſpoſition. At firſt ſhe would perhaps liſten to them with a generous impatience, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards with a cold and ſilent diſdain. She would deſpiſe them as the effect of prejudice, miſrepreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or ignorance. The more aggravated the cenſure, the more vehemently would ſhe proteſt in ſecret, that her friendſhip for this dear injured crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (who is raiſed much higher in her eſteem by ſuch injurious ſuſpicions) ſhall know no bounds, as ſhe is aſſured it can know no end.</p>
               <p>Yet this truſting confidence, this honeſt indiſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is, at this early period of life, as amiable as it is natural; and will, if wiſely cultivated, produce, at its proper ſeaſon, fruits infinitely more valuable than all the guarded circumſpection of premature, and therefore artificial prudence. Men, I believe, are ſeldom ſtruck with theſe ſudden prepoſſeſſions in favour of each other. They are not ſo unſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:024452_0042_0FC74678ADB51C60"/>
nor ſo eaſily led away by the predominance of fancy. They engage more warily, and paſs through the ſeveral ſtages of acquaintance, intimacy, and confidence, by flower gradations; but women, if they are ſometimes deceived in the choice of a friend, enjoy even then an higher degree of ſatisfaction, than if they never truſted. For to be always clad in the burdenſome armour of ſuſpicion, is more pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and inconvenient, than to run the hazard of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering now and then a tranſient injury.</p>
               <p>But the above obſervations only extend to the young and the inexperienced; for I am very cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that women are capable of as faithful and as durable friendſhip as any of the other ſex. They can enter not only into all the enthuſiaſtic tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but into all the ſolid fidelity of attachment. And if we cannot oppoſe inſtances of equal weight with thoſe of Nyſus and Euryalus, Theſeus and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithous, Pylades and Oreſtes, let it be remembered, that it is becauſe the recorders of thoſe characters were men, and that the very exiſtence of them is merely poetical.</p>

               <head>On True and Falſe Meekneſs.</head>
               <p>A LOW voice and ſoft addreſs are the common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications of a well-bred woman, and ſhould ſeem to be the natural effects of a meek and quiet ſpirit; but they are only the outward and viſible ſigns of it: for they are no more meekneſs itſelf, than a red coat is courage, or a black one devotion.</p>
               <p>Yet nothing is more common than to miſtake the ſign for the thing itſelf; nor is any practice more frequent, than that of endeavouring to acquire the exterior mark, without once thinking to labour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the interior grace. Surely this is beginning at the wrong end, like attacking the ſymptom, and neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the diſeaſe. To regulate the features, while the ſoul is in tumults, or to command the voice, while the paſſions are without reſtraint, is as idle as throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing odours into a ſtream when the ſource is pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="unknown:024452_0043_0FC7467F1CC0BBA8"/>The <hi>ſapient king,</hi> who knew better than any man the nature and the power of beauty, has aſſured us, that the temper of the mind has a ſtrong influence upon the features: "Wiſdom maketh the face to ſhine," ſays that exquiſite judge; and ſurely no part of wiſdom is more likely to produce this amiable ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, than a placid ſerenity of ſoul.</p>
               <p>It will not be difficult to diſtinguiſh the true from the artificial meekneſs. The former is univerſal and habitual; the latter, local and temporary. Every young female may keep this rule by her, to enable her to form a juſt judgment of her own temper: if ſhe is not as gentle to her chambermaid, as ſhe is to her viſitor, ſhe may reſt ſatisfied, that the ſpirit of gentleneſs is not in her.</p>
               <p>Who would not be ſhocked and diſappointed to behold a well-bred young lady, ſoft and engaging as the doves of Venus, diſplaying a thouſand graces and attractions to win the hearts of a large company— and the inſtant they are gone, to ſee her look mad as the Pythian maid, and all the frightened graces driven from her furious countenance, only becauſe her gown was brought home a quarter of an hour later than ſhe expected, or her riband ſent half a ſhade lighter or darker than ſhe ordered?</p>
               <p>All men's characters are ſaid to proceed from their ſervants; and this is more particularly true of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: for as their ſituations are more domeſtic, they lie more open to the inſpection of their families, to whom their real characters are eaſily and perfectly known; for they ſeldom think it worth while to practiſe any diſguiſe before thoſe, whoſe good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion they do not value, and who are obliged to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to their moſt inſupportable humours, becauſe they are paid for it.</p>
               <p>Among women of breeding, the exterior of gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is ſo uniformly aſſumed, and the whole manner is ſo perfectly level and <hi>uni,</hi> that it is next to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for a ſtranger to know any thing of their true diſpoſitions by converſing with them: and even the very features are ſo exactly regulated, that phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiognomy,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:024452_0044_0FC746808E722E60"/>
which may ſometimes be truſted among the vulgar, is, with the polite, a moſt lying ſcience.</p>
               <p>A very termagant woman, if ſhe happens alſo to be a very artful one, will be conſcious ſhe has ſo much to conceal, that the dread of betraying her real tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, will make her put on an over-acted ſoftneſs, which, from its very exceſs, may be diſtinguiſhed from the natural by a penetrating eye. That gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs is ever liable to be ſuſpected for the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited, which is ſo exceſſive as to deprive people of the proper uſe of ſpeech, and motion, or which, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

               <p>The countenance and manners of ſome very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhionable perſons may be compared to the inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on their monuments, which ſpeak nothing but good of what is within; but he who knows any thing of the world, or of the human heart, will no more truſt to the countenance than he will depend on the epitaph.</p>
               <p>Among the various artifices of factitious meekneſs, one of the moſt frequent and moſt plauſible, is that of affecting to be always equally delighted with all perſons and all characters. The ſociety of theſe lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid beings is without confidence; their friendſhip without attachment; and their love without affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or even preference. This inſipid mode of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct may be ſafe; but I cannot think it has either taſte, ſenſe, or principle in it.</p>
               <p>Theſe uniformly ſmiling and approving ladies, who have neither the noble courage to reprehend vice, nor the generous warmth to bear their honeſt teſtimony in the cauſe of virtue, conclude every one to be ill-natured who has any penetration, and look upon a diſtinguiſhing judgment as want of tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But they ſhould learn, that this diſcernment does not always proceed from an uncharitable tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but from that long experience and thorough knowledge of the world, which lead theſe who have it, to ſcrutinize into the conduct and diſpoſition of men, before they truſt entirely to thoſe fair appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:024452_0045_0FC7468210367F58"/>
which ſometimes veil the moſt inſidious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes.</p>
               <p>We are perpetually miſtaking the qualities and diſpoſitions of our own hearts. We elevate our fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings into virtues, and qualify our vices into weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes: and hence ariſe ſo many falſe judgments re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting meekneſs. Self-ignorance is at the root of all this miſchief. Many ladies complain, that, for their part, their ſpirit is ſo meek they can bear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; whereas, if they ſpoke truth, they would ſay, their ſpirit is ſo high and unbroken, that they can bear nothing. Strange<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to plead their meekneſs as a reaſon why they cannot endure to be croſſed, and to produce their impatience of contradiction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as a proof of their gentleneſs!</p>
               <p>Meekneſs, like moſt other virtues, has certain li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, which it no ſooner exceeds than it becomes criminal. Servility of ſpirit is not gentleneſs, but weakneſs; and if allowed, under the ſpecious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances it ſometimes puts on, will lead to the moſt dangerous compliances. She who hears innocence maligned without vindicating it, falſehood aſſerted without contradicting it, or religion prophaned without reſenting it, is not gentle, but wicked.</p>
               <p>To give up the cauſe of an innocent, injured friend, if the popular cry happens to be againſt him, is the moſt diſgraceful weakneſs. This was the caſe of Madame de Maintenon. She loved the character and admired the talents of Racine; ſhe careſſed him while he had no enemies, but wanted the greatneſs of mind, or rather the common juſtice, to protect him againſt their reſentment, when he had; and her favourite was abandoned to the ſuſpicious jealouſy of the king, when a prudent remonſtrance might have preſerved him.—But her tameneſs, if not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute connivance in the great maſſacre of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, in whoſe church ſhe had been bred, is a far more guilty inſtance of her weakneſs; an inſtance which, in ſpite of all her devotional zeal and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable prudence, will diſqualify her from ſhining in the annals of good women, however ſhe may be
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:024452_0046_0FC7468F2CC95CD0"/>
entitled to figure among the great and the fortunate. Compare her conduct with that of her undaunted and pious countryman and cotemporary, Bougi, who, when Louis would have prevailed on him to renounce his religion for a commiſſion or a government, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly replied, "If I could be perſuaded to betray my God for a marſhal's ſtaff, I might betray my king for a bribe of much leſs conſequence."</p>
               <p>Meekneſs is imperfect, if it be not both active and paſſive—if it will not enable us to ſubdue our own paſſions and reſentments, as well as qualify us to bear patiently the paſſions and reſentments of others.</p>
               <p>Before we give way to any violent emotion of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, it would, perhaps, be worth while to conſider the value of the object which excites it, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect for a moment, whether the thing we ſo ardent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſire, or ſo vehemently reſent, be really of as much importance to us, as that delightful tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſoul, which we renounce in purſuit of it. If, on a fair calculation, we find we are not likely to get as much as we are ſure to loſe, then, putting all religious conſiderations out of the queſtion, common ſenſe and human policy will tell us, we have made a fooliſh and unprofitable exchange. Inward quiet is a part of one's ſelf; the object of our reſentment may be only a matter of opinion; and certainly, what makes a portion of our actual happineſs ought to be too dear to us, to be ſacrificed for a trifling, foreign, perhaps imaginary good.</p>
               <p>The moſt pointed ſatire I remember to have read, on a mind enſlaved by anger, is an obſervation of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca's. "Alexander," ſaid he,
<q>had two friends, Clitus and Lyſimachus; the one he expoſed to a lion, the other to himſelf: he who was turned looſe to the beaſt, eſcaped; but Clitus was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered: for he was turned looſe to an angry man.</q>
               </p>
               <p>A paſſionate woman's happineſs is never in her own keeping: it is the ſport of accident, and the ſlave of events. It is in the power of her acquaintance, her ſervants, but chiefly of her enemies; and all her comforts lie at the mercy of others. So far from
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:024452_0047_0FC7469306F50568"/>
being willing to learn of him who was meek and lowly, ſhe conſiders meekneſs as the want of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming ſpirit, and lowlineſs as a deſpicable and vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar meanneſs. And an imperious woman will ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle covet the ornament of a meek and quiet ſpirit, that it is almoſt the only ornament ſhe will not be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous to wear. But reſentment is a very expenſive vice. How dearly has it coſt its votaries, even from the ſin of Cain, the firſt offender in this kind! "It is cheaper (ſays a pious writer) to forgive, and ſave the charges."</p>
               <p>If it were only for mere human reaſons, it would turn to a better account to be patient: nothing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feats the malice of an enemy like a ſpirit of forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: the return of rage for rage cannot be ſo effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually provoking. True gentleneſs, like an impene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable armour, repels the moſt pointed ſhafts of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice: they cannot pierce through this invulnerable ſhield, but either fall hurtleſs to the ground, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, to wound the hand that ſhot them.</p>
               <p>A meek ſpirit will not look out of itſelf for hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, becauſe it finds a conſtant banquet at home; yet, by a ſort of divine alchymy, it will convert all external events to its own profit, and be able to deduce ſome good, even from the moſt unpromiſing; it will extract comfort and ſatisfaction from the moſt barren circumſtances:
<q>It will ſuck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But the ſupreme excellence of this complacent quality is, that it naturally diſpoſes the mind where it reſides, to the practice of every other that is amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.

               <head>Thoughts on the Cultivation of the Heart and Temper in the Education of Daughters.</head>
               <p>I HAVE not the fooliſh preſumption to imagine, that I can offer any thing new on a ſubject, which has been ſo ſucceſsfully treated by many learned and able writers. I would only, with all poſſible defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, beg leave to hazard a few ſhort remarks on that part of the ſubject of education, which I would call the <hi>education of the heart.</hi> I am well aware, that this part alſo has not been leſs ſkilfully and forcibly diſcuſſed than the reſt, though I cannot at the ſame time, help remarking, that it does not appear to have been ſo much adopted into common practice.</p>
               <p>It appears then, that notwithſtanding the great and real improvements, which have been made in the affair of female education, and notwithſtanding the more enlarged and generous views of it, which prevail in the preſent day, there is ſtill a very material defect, which it is not, in general, enough the object of attention to remove. This defect ſeems to conſiſt in this, that too little regard is paid to the diſpoſition of the <hi>mind;</hi> that the indications of the <hi>temper</hi> are not properly cheriſhed; nor the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>heart</hi> ſufficiently regulated.</p>
               <p>In the firſt education of girls, as far as the cuſtoms, which faſhion eſtabliſhes, are right, they ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly be followed. Let the exterior be made a conſiderable object of attention; but let it not be the principal, let it not be the only one. Let the graces be induſtriouſly cultivated; but let them not be cultivated at the expenſe of the virtues.—Let the arms, the head, the whole perſon be carefully poliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but let not the heart be the only portion of the human anatomy, which ſhall be totally overlooked.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="unknown:024452_0049_0FC746958A256D68"/>The neglect of this cultivation ſeems to proceed as much from a bad taſte, as fro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The effects of moſt of theſe accompliſhments addreſs themſelves to the ſenſes; and there are more who can ſee and hear, than there are, who can judge and reflect.</p>
               <p>Perſonal perfection is not only more obvious, it is alſo more rapid; and even in very accompliſhed cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, elegance uſually precedes principle.</p>
               <p>But the heart, that natural ſeat of evil propenſities, that little troubleſome empire of the paſſions, is led to what is right by ſlow motions and imperceptible degrees. It muſt be admoniſhed by reproof, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured by kindneſs. Its livelieſt advances are frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impeded by the obſtinacy of prejudice, and its brighteſt promiſes often obſcured by the tempeſts of paſſion. It is ſlow in its acquiſition of virtue, and reluctant in its approaches to piety.</p>
               <p>There is another reaſon, which proves this mental cultivation to be more important, as well as more difficult, than any other part of education. In the uſual faſhionable accompliſhments, the buſineſs of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring them is almoſt always getting forwards, and one difficulty is conquered, before another is ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſhow itſelf; for a prudent teacher will level the road his pupil is to paſs and ſmooth the inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities which might retard her progreſs.</p>
               <p>But in morals, (which ſhould be the greateſt object conſtantly kept in view) the taſk is far more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult. The unruly and turbulent deſires of the heart are not ſo obedient; one paſſion will ſtart up, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore another is ſuppreſſed. The ſubduing Hercules cannot cut off the heads ſo often as the prolific hydra
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:024452_0050_0FC746A1E055EC70"/>
can produce them, nor fell the ſtubborn Antaeus, ſo faſt as he can recruit his ſtrength, and riſe in vigour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and repeated oppoſition.</p>
               <p>If all the accompliſhments could be bought at the price of a ſingle virtue, the purchaſe would be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely dear! And, however ſtartling it may ſound, I think it is, notwithſtanding, true, that the labours of a good and wiſe mother, who is anxious for her daughter's moſt important intereſts, will ſeem to be at variance with thoſe of her inſtructors. She will, doubtleſs, rejoice at her progreſs in any polite art, but ſhe will rejoice with trembling:—humility and piety form the ſolid and durable baſis, on which ſhe wiſhes to raiſe the ſuperſtructure of the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; while the accompliſhments themſelves are frequently of ſuch an unſteady nature, that if the foundation is not ſecured, in proportion as the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is enlarged, it will be overloaded and deſtroyed by thoſe very ornaments which were intended to embelliſh what they have contributed to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>The more oſtenſible qualifications ſhould be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully regulated, or they will be in danger of putting to flight the modeſt train of retreating virtues, which cannot ſafely ſubſiſt before the bold eye of public obſervation, or bear the bolder tongue of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent and audacious flattery. A tender mother cannot but feel an honeſt triumph, in contemplating thoſe excellencies in her daughter which deſerve ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe; but ſhe will alſo ſhudder at the vanity which that applauſe may excite, and at thoſe hitherto un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known ideas which it may awaken.</p>
               <p>The maſter, (it is his intereſt, and perhaps his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,) will naturally teach a girl to ſet her improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the moſt conſpicuous point of light. <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>One would be led to imagine, by the common mode of female education, that life conſiſted of one uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal holiday, and that the only conteſt was, who ſhould be beſt enabled to excel in the ſports and games that were to be celebrated on it.

But as the world ſeems to be very well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed of their importance, there is the leſs occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to inſiſt on their utility. Yet, though well-bred young women ſhould learn to dance, ſing, recite, and draw, the end of a good education is not, that they may become dancers, ſingers, players, or pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; its real object is to make them good daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, good wives, good miſtreſſes, good members of ſociety, and good chriſtians. The above qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, therefore, are intended to <hi>adorn</hi> their <hi>leiſure,</hi> not to <hi>employ</hi> their <hi>lives;</hi> for an amiable and wiſe woman will always have ſomething better to value herſelf on, than theſe advantages, which, however captivating, are ſtill but ſubordinate parts of a tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excellent character.</p>

Do they not often ſet a higher value on thoſe acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions which are calculated to attract obſervation, and catch the eye of the multitude, than on thoſe which are valuable, permanent, and internal?

It will be underſtood and admired by the man, whoſe happineſs ſhe is one day to make, whoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily ſhe is to govern, and whoſe children ſhe is to educate. He will not ſeek for her in the haunts of diſſipation; for he knows he ſhall not find her there: but he will ſeek for her in the boſom of retirement, in the practice of every domeſtic virtue, in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of every amiable accompliſhment, exerted in the ſhade, to enliven retirement, to heighten the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing pleaſures of ſocial intercourſe, and to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſh the narrow circle of family delights. To this amiable purpoſe, a truly good and well educat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed young lady will dedicate more elegant accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments, inſtead of exhibiting them to attract ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, or depreſs inferiority.</p>
               <p>Young girls, who have more vivacity than under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, will often make a ſprightly figure in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. But this agreeable talent for entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others, is frequently dangerous to themſelves, nor is it by any means to be deſired or encouraged very early in life. This immaturity of wit it helped on by frivolous reading, which will produce its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in much leſs time than books of ſolid inſtruction: for the imagination is touched ſooner than the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; and effects are more rapid as they are more pernicious. Converſation ſhould be the <hi>reſult</hi>
                  <pb n="55" facs="unknown:024452_0053_0FC746B0F8E73708"/>
of education, not the <hi>precurſor</hi> of it. It is a gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en fruit, when ſuffered to grow gradually on the tree of knowledge; but if precipitated by forced and unnatural means, it will in the end become vapid, in proportion as it is artificial.</p>
               <p>The beſt effects of a careful and religious educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are often very remote: they are to be diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in future ſcenes, and exhibited in untried con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions. Every event of life will be putting the heart into freſh ſituations, and making demands on its prudence, its firmneſs, its integrity, or its piety. Thoſe, whoſe buſineſs it is to form it, can foreſee none of theſe ſituations: yet, as far as human wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom will allow, they muſt enable it to provide for them all, with an humble dependence on the divine aſſiſtance. A well-diſciplined ſoldier muſt learn and practiſe all his evolutions, though he does not know on what ſervice his leader may command him, by what foe he ſhall be attacked, nor what mode of combat the enemy may uſe.</p>
               <p>One great art of education conſiſts in not ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the feelings to become too acute by unneceſſary awakening, nor too obtuſe by the want of exertion. The former renders them the ſource of calamity, and totally ruins the temper: while the latter blunts and debaſes them, and produces a dull, cold, and ſelfiſh ſpirit. For the mind is an inſtrument, which, if wound too high, will loſe its ſweetneſs, and if not enough ſtrained, will abate of its vigour.</p>
               <p>How cruel is it to extinguiſh by neglect or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs, the precious ſenſibility of an open temper, to chill the amiable glow of an ingenuous ſoul, and to quench the bright flame of a noble and generous ſpirit! Theſe are of higher worth than all the docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of learning, of dearer price than all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, which can be derived from the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined and artificial mode of education.</p>
               <p>But ſenſibility and delicacy, and an ingenuous tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per make no part of education, exclaims the peda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue—they are reducible to no claſs—they come under no article of inſtruction—they belong neither

to languages nor to muſic. What an error! They are a part of education, and of infinitely more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
<q>Than all their pedant diſcip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

It is true, they are ranged under no claſs, but they are ſuperior to all; they are of more eſteem than languages or muſic; for they are the language of the heart, and the muſic of the according paſſions. Yet this ſenſibility is, in many inſtances, ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cultivated, that it is not uncommon to ſee thoſe who affect more than uſual ſagacity, caſt a ſmile of ſupercilious pity, at any indication of a warm, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous, or enthuſiaſtic temper in the lively and the young: as much as to ſay,
<q>they will know better, and will have more diſcretion when they are old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</q>
But every appearance of amiable ſimplicity, or of honeſt ſhame, <hi>Nature's haſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y conſcience,</hi> will be dear to ſenſible hearts; they will carefully cheriſh every ſuch indication in a young female: for they will perceive, that it is this temper, wiſely cultivat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which will one day make her enamoured of the lovelineſs of virtue, and the beauty of holineſs: from which ſhe will acquire a taſte for the doctrines of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and a ſpirit to perform the duties of it. And thoſe, who wiſh to make her aſhamed of this charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing temper, and ſeek to diſpoſſeſs her of it, will, it is to be feared, give her nothing better in exchange. But whoever reflects at all, will eaſily diſcern how carefully this enthuſiaſm is to be directed, and how judiciouſly its redundancies are to be lopped away.</p>
               <p>Prudence is not natural to children: they can, however, ſubſtitute art in its ſtead. But is it not much better, that a girl ſhould diſcover the faults in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to her age, than conceal them under this dark and impenetrable veil? I could almoſt venture to aſſert, that there is ſomething more becoming in the very errors of nature, where they are undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed, than in the affectation of virtue itſelf, where the reality is wanting. And I am ſo far from being an admirer of prodigies, that I am extremely apt
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:024452_0055_0FC746B5D8FAFD30"/>
to ſuſpect them; and am always infinitely better pleaſed with nature, in her more common modes of operation. The preciſe and premature wiſdom, which ſome girls have cunning enough to aſſume, is of a more dangerous tendency than any of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural failings can be; as it effectually covers thoſe ſecret bad diſpoſitions, which, if they diſplayed thmeſelves, might be rectified. The hypocriſy of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming virtues, which are not inherent in the heart, prevents the growth and diſcloſure of thoſe real ones, which it is the great end of education to cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate.</p>
               <p>But if the natural indications of the temper are to be ſuppreſſed and ſtifled, where are the diagnoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, by which the ſtate of the mind is to be known? The wiſe Author of all things, who did nothing in vain, doubtleſs intended them as ſymptoms, by which to judge of the diſeaſes of the heart; and it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible diſeaſes ſhould be cured before they are known. If the ſtream be ſo cut off, as to prevent communication, or ſo choaked up as to defeat diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, how ſhall we ever reach the ſource, out of which are the iſſues of life?</p>
               <p>This cunning, which of all the different diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions girls diſcover, is moſt to be dreaded, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by nothing ſo much as by fear. If thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them expreſs violent and unreaſonable anger at every trivial offence, it will always promote this temper, and will very frequently create it, where there was a natural tendency to frankneſs. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet tranſports of rage, which many betray on every ſlight occaſion, and the little diſtinction they make between venial errors and premeditated crimes, naturally diſpoſe a child to conceal, what ſhe does not however care to ſuppreſs. Anger in one will not remedy the faults of another; for how can an inſtrument of ſin cure ſin? If a girl is kept in a ſtate of perpetual and ſlaviſh terror, ſhe will, perhaps, have artifice enough to conceal thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſities which ſhe knows are wrong, or thoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which ſhe thinks are moſt obnoxious to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:024452_0056_0FC746B746D5D120"/>
But, nevertheleſs, ſhe will not ceaſe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge thoſe propenſities, and to commit thoſe actions, when ſhe can do it with impunity.</p>
               <p>Good <hi>diſpoſitions,</hi> of themſelves, will go but a very little way, unleſs they are confirmed into good <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</hi> And this cannot be effected but by a careful courſe of religious inſtruction, and a patient and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious cultivation of the moral temper.</p>
               <p>But, though girls ſhould not be treated with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs, nor the firſt openings of the paſſions blight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by cold ſeverity; yet I am of opinion, that young females ſhould be accuſtomed, very early in life, to a certain degree of reſtraint. The natural caſt of character, and the moral diſtinctions between the ſexes, ſhould not be diſregarded, even in childhood. That bold, independent, enterpriſing ſpirit, which is ſo much admired in boys, ſhould not, when it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to diſcover itſelf in the other ſex, be encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but ſuppreſſed. Girls ſhould be taught to give up their opinions betimes, and not pertinaciouſly to carry on a diſpute, even if they ſhould know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be in the right. I do not mean, that they ſhould be robbed of the liberty of private judgment, but that they ſhould by no means be encouraged to contract a contentious or contradictory turn. It is of the greateſt importance to their future happineſs, that they ſhould acquire a ſubmiſſive temper, and a forbearing ſpirit; for it is a leſſon which the world will not fail to make them frequently practiſe, when they come abroad into it; and they will not practiſe it the worſe, for having learnt it the ſooner. Theſe early reſtraints, in the limitation here meant, are ſo far from being an effect of cruelty, that they are the moſt indubitable marks of affection, and are the more meritorious, as they are ſevere trials of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs. But all the beneficial effects, which a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can expect from this watchfulneſs, will be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely defeated, if it is practiſed occaſionally, and not habitually, and if it ever appears to be uſed to gratify caprice, ill-humour or reſentment.</p>
               <p>Thoſe, who have children to educate, ought to be
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:024452_0057_0FC746BD38CC7760"/>
extremely patient: it is indeed a labour of love. They ſhould reflect, that extraordinary talents are neither eſſential to the well-being of ſociety, nor to the happineſs of individuals. If that had been the caſe, the beneficent Father of the univerſe would not have made them ſo rare. For it is as eaſy for an Almighty Creator to produce a Newton, as an ordinary man; and he could have made thoſe powers common which we now conſider as wonderful, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any miraculous exertion of his omnipotence, if the exiſtence of many Newtons had been neceſſary to the perfection of his wiſe and gracious plan.</p>
               <p>Surely, therefore, there is more piety, as well as more ſenſe, in labouring to improve the talents which children actually have, than in lamenting that they do not poſſeſs ſupernatural endowments, or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelic perfections. A paſſage of lord Bacon's furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es an admirable incitement for endeavouring to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the amiable and chriſtian grace of charity to its fartheſt extent, inſtead of indulging an over-anxious care for more brilliant but leſs important acquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<q>The deſire of power in exceſs cauſed the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels to fall; the deſire of knowledge in exceſs cauſed man to fall; but in charity is no exceſs; neither can men nor angels come into danger by it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>A girl who has docility will ſeldom be found to want underſtanding enough for all the purpoſes of a ſocial, a happy, and an uſeful life. And when we behold the tender hope of fond and anxious love, blaſted by diſappointment, the defect will as often be diſcovered to proceed from the neglect or the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of cultivation, as from the natural temper; and thoſe who lament the evil, will ſometimes be found to have occaſioned it.</p>
               <p>It is as injudicious for parents to ſet out with too ſanguine a dependence on the merit of their children, as it is for them to be diſcouraged at every repulſe. When their wiſhes are defeated in this or that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inſtance, where they had treaſured up ſome darling expectation, this is ſo far from being a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

for relaxing their attention, that it ought to be an additional motive for redoubling it. Thoſe, who hope to do a great deal, muſt not expect to do every thing. If they know any thing of the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of ſin, the blindneſs of prejudice, or the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the human heart, they will alſo know, that that heart will always remain, after the very beſt poſſible education, full of infirmity and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Extraordinary allowances, therefore, muſt be made for the weakneſs of nature in this its weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſtake. After much is done, much will remain to do, and much, very much, will ſtill be left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done. For this regulation of the paſſions and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions cannot be the work of education alone, without the concurrence of divine grace operating on the heart. Why then ſhould parents repine, if their efforts are not always crowned with immediate ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs? They ſhould conſider, that they are not educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting cherubs and ſeraphs, but men and women— creatures, who at their beſt eſtate are altogether vanity: how little then can be expected from them in the weakneſs and imbecility of infancy! I have dwelt on this part of the ſubject the longer, becauſe I am certain that many, who have ſet out with a warm and active zeal, have cooled on the very firſt diſcouragement, and have afterwards almoſt totally remitted their vigilance, through a criminal kind of deſpair.</p>
               <p>Great allowances muſt be made for a profuſion of gaiety, loquacity, and even indiſcretion in children, that there may be animation enough left to ſupply an active and uſeful character, when the firſt fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of the youthful paſſions is over, and the redundant ſpirits ſhall come to ſubſide.</p>
               <p>If it be true, as a conſummate judge of human nature has obſerved,
<q>That not a vanity is given in vain,</q>
it is alſo true, that there is ſcarcely a ſingle paſſion, which may not be turned to ſome good account, if prudently rectified, and ſkilfully turned into the road
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:024452_0059_0FC746CB81A52098"/>
of ſome neighbouring virtue. It cannot be violently bent, or unnaturally forced towards an object of a totally oppoſite nature, but may be gradually inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards a correſpondent but ſuperior affection. Anger, hatred, reſentment, and ambition, the moſt reſtleſs and turbulent paſſions which ſhake and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the human ſoul, may be led to become the moſt active oppoſers of ſin, after having been its moſt ſucceſsful inſtruments. Our anger, for inſtance, which can never be totally ſubdued, may be made to turn againſt ourſelves, for our weak and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience—our hatred, againſt every ſpecies of vice—our ambition, which will not be diſcarded, may be ennobled: it will not change its name, but its object; it will deſpiſe what it lately valued, nor be contented to graſp at leſs than immortality.</p>
               <p>Thus the joys, fears, hopes, deſires, all the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and affections, which ſeparate in various cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents from the ſoul, will, if directed into their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per channels, after having fertiliſed wherever they have flowed, return again to ſwell and enrich the parent ſource.</p>
               <p>That the very paſſions which appear the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controulable and unpromiſing, may be intended in the great ſcheme of Providence, to anſwer ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant purpoſe, is remarkably evidenced in the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and hiſtory of ſaint Paul. A remark on this ſubject by an ingenious old Spaniſh writer, which I will here take the liberty to tranſlate, will better illuſtrate my meaning.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>To convert the bittereſt enemy into the moſt zealous advocate, is the work of God for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of man. Plutarch has obſerved, that the medical ſcience would be brought to the utmoſt perfection, when poiſon ſhould be converted into phyſic. Thus, in the mortal diſeaſe of Judaiſm and idolatry, our bleſſed Lord converted the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's venom of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>To win the paſſions, therefore, over to the cauſe of virtue, anſwers a much nobler end than their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction would poſſibly do, even if that could be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. But it is their nature never to obſerve a neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality; they are either rebels or auxilaries; and an enemy ſubdued is an ally obtained. If I may be allowed to change the alluſion ſo ſoon, I would ſay, that the paſſions alſo reſemble fires, which are friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and beneficial when under proper direction; but if ſuffered to blaze without reſtraint, they carry de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſtation along with them, and, if totally extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, leave the benighted mind in a ſtate of cold and comfortleſs inanity.</p>
               <p>But in ſpeaking of the uſefulneſs of the paſſions, as inſtruments of virtue, <hi>envy</hi> and <hi>lying</hi> muſt always be excepted: theſe, I am perſuaded, muſt either go on in ſtill progreſſive miſchief, or elſe be radically cured before any good can be expected from the heart which has been infected with them. For I never will believe that envy, though paſſed through all the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſtrainers, can be refined into a virtuous emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or lying improved into an agreeable turn for innocent invention. Almoſt all the other paſſions may be made to take an amiable hue: but theſe two muſt either be totally extirpated, or be always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to preſerve their original deformity, and to wear their native black.</p>

               </p>
               <p>We are told by the ſame animated writer, that "wiſdom is the breath of the power of God." How infinitely ſuperior, in grandeur and ſublimity, is this deſcription to the origin of the <hi>wiſdom</hi> of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, as deſcribed by their poets and mythologiſts! In the exalted ſtrains of the Hebrew poetry we read, that

               <p>The philoſophical author of <hi>The defence of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> obſerves, that knowledge has ſomething of venom and malignity in it, when taken without its proper corrective, and what that is, the inſpired ſaint Paul teaches us, by placing it as the immediate antidote: <hi>Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth.</hi> Perhaps, it is the vanity of human wiſdom, unchaſtiſed by this correcting principle, which has made ſo many infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels.

               <p>A man muſt be an infidel either from pride, preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, or bad education: he cannot be one unawares, or by ſurpriſe; for infidelity is not occaſioned by ſudden impulſe or violent temptation.

Even good men frequently fail in their duty through the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:024452_0063_0FC746DDC85CE268"/>
of nature, and the allurements of the world; but the infidel errs on a plan, on a ſettled and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate principle.</p>
               <p>But though the minds of men are ſometimes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally infected with this diſeaſe, either through un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy prepoſſeſſion, or ſome of the other cauſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove mentioned: yet I am unwilling to believe, that there is in nature ſo monſtrouſly incongruous a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as a <hi>female infidel.</hi> The leaſt reflexion on the temper, the character, and the education of women, makes the mind revolt with horror from an idea ſo improbable, and ſo unnatural.</p>
               <p>May I be allowed to obſerve, that, in general, the minds of girls ſeem more aptly prepared, in their early youth, for the reception of ſerious impreſſions, than thoſe of the other ſex, and that their leſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſituations, in more advanced life, qualify them better for the preſervation of them? The daughters (of good parents I mean) are often more carefully inſtructed in their religious duties, than the ſons, and this from a variety of cauſes. They are not ſo ſoon ſent from under the parental eye into the buſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the world, nor ſo early expoſed to the conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of bad example: their hearts are naturally more flexible, ſoft, and liable to any kind of impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the forming hand may ſtamp on them; and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as they do not receive the ſame claſſical educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with boys, their feeble minds are not obliged at once to receive and ſeparate the precepts of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, and the documents of pagan philoſophy. The neceſſity of doing this perhaps ſomewhat wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens the ſerious impreſſions of young men, at leaſt till the underſtanding is formed, and confuſes their ideas of piety, by mixing them with ſo much hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous matter. They only caſually read, or hear read, the ſcriptures of truth, while they are oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to learn by heart, conſtrue and repeat the poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal fables of the leſs than human gods of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients. And as the excellent author of <hi>The internal evidence of the chriſtian religion</hi> obſerves,
<q>Nothing has ſo much contributed to corrupt the true ſpirit
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:024452_0064_0FC746E082868F88"/>
of the chriſtian inſtitution, as that partiality which we contract, in our earlieſt education, for the manners of pagan antiquity.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Girls, therefore, who do <hi>not</hi> contract this early partiality, ought to have a clearer notion of their religious duties: they are not obliged, at an age when the judgment is ſo weak, to diſtinguiſh between the doctrines of Zeno, of Epicurus, and of Chriſt; and to embarraſs their minds with the various mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals which were taught in the <hi>porch,</hi> in the <hi>academy,</hi> and on the <hi>mount.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is preſumed, that theſe remarks cannot poſſibly be ſo miſunderſtood, as to be conſtrued into the leaſt diſreſpect to literature, or a want of the higheſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence for a learned education, the baſis of all ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant knowledge: they are only intended, with all proper deference, to point out to young women, that however inferior their advantages of acquiring a knowledge of the belles-lettres are to thoſe of the other ſex; yet it depends on themſelves not to be ſurpaſſed in this moſt important of all ſtudies, for which their abilities are equal, and their opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, perhaps, greater.</p>
               <p>But the mere exemption from infidelity is ſo ſmall a part of the religious character, that I hope no one will attempt to claim any merit from this negative ſort of goodneſs, or value herſelf merely for not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the very worſt thing ſhe poſſibly can be. Let no miſtaken girl fancy ſhe gives a proof of her wit by her want of piety, or that a contempt of things ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and ſacred will exalt her underſtanding, or raiſe her character even in the opinion of the moſt avowed male infidels. For one may venture to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that with all their profligate ideas, both of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and of religion, neither Bolingbroke, Wharton, Buckingham, nor even <hi>lord Cheſterfield himſelf,</hi> would have eſteemed a woman the more for her being ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious.</p>
               <p>With whatever ridicule a polite free-thinker may affect to treat religion himſelf, he will think it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary his wife ſhould entertain different notions of
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:024452_0065_0FC746E2042EA208"/>
it. He may pretend to deſpiſe it as a matter of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, depending on creeds and ſyſtems; but, if he is a man of ſenſe, he will know the value of it, as a governing principle, which is to influence her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and direct her actions. If he ſees her unaffected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſincere in the practice of her religious duties, it will be a ſecret pledge to him, that ſhe will be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exact in fulfilling the conjugal; for he can have no reaſonable dependence on her attachment to <hi>him,</hi> if he has no opinion of her fidelity to GOD; for ſhe who neglects firſt duties, gives but an indifferent proof of her diſpoſition to fill up inferior ones; and how can a man of any underſtanding, (whatever his own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious profeſſions may be) truſt that women with the care of his family, and the education of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who wants herſelf the beſt incentive to a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous life, the belief that ſhe is an accountable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the reflexion that ſhe has an immortal ſoul?</p>
               <p>Cicero ſpoke it as the higheſt commendation of Cato's character, that he embraced philoſophy, not for the ſake of <hi>diſputing</hi> like a philoſopher, but of <hi>living</hi> like one. The chief purpoſe of chriſtian know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is to promote the great end of a chriſtian life. Every rational woman ſhould, no doubt, be able to give a reaſon of the hope that is in her; but this knowledge is beſt acquired, and the duties conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent on it beſt performed, by reading books of plain piety and practical devotion, and not by entering in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the endleſs feuds, and engaging in the unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble contentions of partial controverſialiſts. Nothing is more unamiable than the narrow ſpirit of party zeal, nor more diſguſting than to hear a woman deal out judgments, and denounce vengeance againſt any one, who happens to differ from her in ſome opinion, perhaps of no real importance, and which, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, ſhe may be juſt as wrong in rejecting, as the object of her cenſure is in embracing. A furious and unmerciful female bigot wanders as far beyond the limits preſcribed to her ſex, as a Thaleſtris or a Joan d'Arc. Violent debate has made as few con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:024452_0066_0FC746E377E9CFF0"/>
as the ſword, and both theſe inſtruments are particularly unbecoming, when wielded by a female hand.</p>
               <p>But though no one will be frightened out of their opinions, yet they may be perſuaded out of them: they may be touched by the affecting earneſtneſs of ſerious converſation, and allured by the attractive beauty of a conſiſtently ſerious life. And while a young woman ought to dread the name of a wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling polemic, it is her duty to aſpire after the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable character of a ſincere chriſtian. But this dignified character ſhe can by no means deſerve, if ſhe is ever afraid to avow her principles, or aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to defend them. A profligate, who makes it a point to ridicule every thing which comes under the appearance of formal inſtruction, will be diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed at the ſpirited yet modeſt rebuke of a pious young woman. But there is as much efficacy in the manner of reproving prophaneneſs, as in the words. If ſhe corrects it with moroſeneſs, ſhe defeats the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of her remedy, by her unſkilful manner of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring it. If, on the other hand, ſhe affects to defend the inſulted cauſe of God, in a faint tone of voice, and ſtudied ambiguity of phraſe, or with an air of levity, and a certain expreſſion of pleaſure in her eyes, which proves ſhe is ſecretly delighted with what ſhe pretends to cenſure, ſhe injures religion much more than he did, who publicly prophaned it; for ſhe plainly indicates, that ſhe either does not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, or does not reſpect what ſhe profeſſes. The other attacked it as an open foe; ſhe betrays it as a falſe friend. No one pays any regard to the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of an avowed enemy: but the deſertion or treachery of a profeſſed friend, is dangerous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed!</p>
               <p>It is a ſtrange notion, which prevails in the world, that religion only belongs to the old and the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, and that it is not worth while to pay the leaſt attention to it, while we are capable of attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to any thing elſe. They allow it to be proper enough for the clergy, whoſe buſineſs it is, and for
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:024452_0067_0FC746E7B13682C0"/>
the aged, who have not ſpirits for any buſineſs at all. But till they can prove, that none except the clergy and aged <hi>die,</hi> it muſt be confeſſed that this is moſt wretched reaſoning.</p>
               <p>Great injury is done to the intereſts of religion, by placing it in a gloomy and unamiable light. It is ſometimes ſpoken of, as if it would actually make a handſome woman ugly, or a young one wrinkled. But can any thing be more abſurd, than to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the beauty of holineſs as the ſource of deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?</p>
               <p>There are few, perhaps, ſo entirely plunged in buſineſs, or abſorbed in pleaſure, as not to intend, at ſome future time, to ſet about a religious life in good earneſt. But then they conſider it as a kind of <hi>dernier reſſort,</hi> and think it prudent to defer flying to this diſagreeable refuge, till they have no reliſh left for any thing elſe. Do they forget, that to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form this great buſineſs well, requires all the ſtrength of their youth, and all the vigour of their unimpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed capacities? To confirm this aſſertion, they may obſerve how much the ſlighteſt indiſpoſition, even in the moſt active ſeaſon of life, diſorders every facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and diſqualifies them for attending to the moſt ordinary affairs; and then let them reflect how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle able they will be to tranſact the moſt important of all buſineſs, in the moment of excruciating pain, or in the day of univerſal debility.</p>

               <p>GOOD <hi>ſenſe</hi> is as different from <hi>genius,</hi> as percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is from invention; yet, though diſtinct qualities, they frequently ſubſiſt together. It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together oppoſite to <hi>wit,</hi> but by no means incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with it. It is not ſcience; for there is ſuch a thing as unlettered good ſenſe; yet, though it is neither wit, learning, nor genius, it is a ſubſtitute for each, where they do not exiſt, and the perfection of all where they do.</p>
               <p>Good ſenſe is ſo far from deſerving the apellation of <hi>common ſenſe,</hi> by which it is frequently called, that it is perhaps one of the rareſt qualities of the human mind. If, indeed, this name is given it in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to its peculiar ſuitableneſs to the purpoſes of common life, there is great propriety in it. Good ſenſe appears to differ from taſte, in this, that taſte is an inſtantaneous deciſion of the mind, a ſudden reliſh of what is beautiful, or diſguſt at what is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, in an object, without waiting for the ſlower confirmation of the judgment. Good ſenſe is, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, that confirmation, which eſtabliſhes a ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conceived idea, or feeling, by the powers of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring and reflecting. They differ alſo in this, that taſte ſeems to have a more immediate reference to arts, to literature, and to almoſt every object of the ſenſes; while good ſenſe riſes to moral excellence,
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:024452_0069_0FC746F3E467DEB8"/>
and exerts its influence on life and manners. Taſte is fitted to the perception and enjoyment of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is beautiful in art or nature: good ſenſe, to the improvement of the conduct, and the regulation of the heart.</p>
               <p>Yet the term, good ſenſe, is uſed indiſcriminately to expreſs either a finiſhed taſte for letters, or an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variable prudence in the affairs of life. It is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times applied to the moſt moderate abilities, in which caſe, the expreſſion is certainly too ſtrong: and at others to the moſt ſhining, when it is as much too weak and inadequate. A ſenſible man is the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, but unappropriated phraſe, for every degree in the ſcale of underſtanding, from the ſober mortal, who obtains it by his decent demeanor and ſolid dullneſs, to him whoſe talents qualify him to rank with a Bacon, a Harris, or a Johnſon.</p>
               <p>Genius is the power of invention and imitation. It is an incommunicable faculty: no art or ſkill of the poſſeſſor can beſtow the ſmalleſt portion of it on another; no pains or labour can reach the ſummit of perfection, where the ſeeds of it are wanting in the mind: yet it is capable of infinite improvement where it actually exiſts, and is attended with the higheſt capacity of communicating inſtruction, as well as delight to others.</p>
               <p>It is the peculiar property of genius to ſtrike out great or beautiful things: it is the felicity of good ſenſe not to do abſurd ones. Genius breaks out in ſplendid ſentiments and elevated ideas: good ſenſe confines its more circumſcribed, but perhaps more uſeful walk, within the limits of prudence and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety.</p>

                  <pb n="72" facs="unknown:024452_0070_0FC746F5793A2198"/>This is, perhaps, the fineſt picture of human ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius that ever was drawn by a human pencil. It pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents a living image of a creative imagination, or a power of inventing things which have no actual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence.</p>
               <p>With ſuperficial judges, who, it muſt be confeſſed, make up the greater part of the maſs of mankind, talents are only liked or underſtood to a certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. Lofty ideas are above the reach of ordinary apprehenſions: the vulgar allow thoſe who poſſeſs them, to be in a ſomewhat higher ſtate of mind than themſelves; but of the vaſt gulph which ſeparates them, they have not the leaſt conception. They ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a ſuperiority; but of its extent they neither know the value, nor can conceive the reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. It is true, the mind, as well as the eye, can take in objects larger than itſelf; but this is only true of great minds: for a man of low capacity, who conſiders a conſummate genius, reſembles one, who ſeeing a column for the firſt time, and ſtanding at too great a diſtance to take in the whole of it, concludes it to be flat; or, like one unacquainted with the firſt principles of philoſophy, who, finding the ſenſible horizon appear a plain ſurface, can form no idea of the ſpherical form of the whole, which he does not ſee, and laughs at the account of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podes, which he cannot comprehend.</p>
               <p>Whatever is excellent is alſo rare; what is uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful is more common. How many thouſands are born qualified for the coarſe employments of life, for one who is capable of excelling in the fine arts! yet ſo it ought to be; becauſe our natural wants are more numerous, and more importunate, than the intellec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual.</p>
               <p>Whenever it happens, that a man of diſtinguiſhed talents has been drawn by miſtake, or precipitated by paſſion, into any dangerous indiſcretion; it is common for thoſe, whoſe coldneſs of temper has ſupplied the place, and uſurped the name, of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to boaſt of their own ſteadier virtue, and triumph in their own ſuperior caution; only becauſe
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:024452_0071_0FC746F710498A58"/>
they have never been aſſailed by a temptation ſtrong enough to ſurpriſe them into error. And with what a viſible appropriation of the character to themſelves, do they conſtantly conclude, with a cordial compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to <hi>common ſenſe!</hi> They point out the beauty and uſefulneſs of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>his quality ſo forcibly and expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly, that you cannot poſſibly miſtake whoſe picture they are drawing with ſo flattering a pencil. The unhappy man, whoſe conduct has been ſo feelingly arraigned, perhaps acted from good, though miſtak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en motives—at leaſt, from motives of which his cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer has not capacity to judge: but the event was unfavourable, nay the action might be really wrong, and the vulgar maliciouſly take the opportunity of this ſingle indiſcretion, to lift themſelves nearer on a level with a character, which, except in this inſtance, has always thrown them at the moſt diſgraceful and mortifying diſtance.</p>
               <p>The elegant biographer of Collins, in his affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apology for that unfortunate genius, remarks,
<q>That the gifts of imagination bring the heavieſt ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>lties with unerring rectitude, or invariable propriety, requires a degree of firmneſs, and of cool attention, which does not always attend the higher gifts of the mind: yet difficult as nature herſelf ſeems to have rendered the taſk of regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity to genius, it is the ſupreme conſolation of dullneſs, and of folly, to point with gothic tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph to thoſe exceſſes which are the overflowing of faculties they never enjoyed.</q>
               </p>
               <p>What the greater part of the world mean by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe, will be generally found, on a cloſer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, to be art, fraud, or ſelfiſhneſs! That ſort of ſaving prudence which makes men extremely atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to their own ſafety, or profit—diligent in the purſuit of their own pleaſures or intereſts—and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly at their eaſe as to what becomes of the reſt of mankind. Furious, where their own property is concerned, philoſophers when nothing but the good of others is at ſtake, and perfectly reſigned under all calamities but their own.</p>

                  <pb n="74" facs="unknown:024452_0072_0FC746F8753C3838"/>When we ſee ſo many accompliſhed wits of the preſent age, as remarkable for the decorum of their lives, as for the brilliancy of their writings, we may believe, that next to principle, it is owing to their <hi>good ſenſe,</hi> which regulates and chaſtiſes their imginations. The vaſt conceptions which enable a true genius to aſcend the ſublimeſt heights, may be ſo connected with the ſtronger paſſions, as to give it a natu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Add to this, when it is conſidered with what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection the divine wiſdom has thought fit to ſtamp every thing human, it will be found, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence and infirmity are ſo inſeparably wound up in each other, that a man derives the ſoreneſs of temper, and irritability of nerve, which makes him uneaſy to others, and unhappy in himſelf, from thoſe exquiſite feelings, and that elevated pitch of thought, by which, as the apoſtle expreſſes it, on a more ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous occaſion, he is, as it were, out of the body.</p>
               <p>It is not aſtoniſhing, therefore, when the ſpirit is carried away by the magnificence of its own ideas,
<q>Not touch'd, but rapt—not weaken'd, but inſpir'd,</q>
that the frail body, which is the natural victim of pain, diſeaſe, and death, ſhould not always be able to follow the mind in its aſpiring flights, but ſhould be as imperfect as if it belonged only to an ordinary ſoul.</p>
               <p>Beſides, might not providence intend to humble human pride, by preſenting to our eyes ſo mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a view of the weakneſs and infirmity of even his beſt work? Perhaps man, who is already but a little lower than the angels, might, like the revolted ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, totally have ſhaken off obedience and ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his Creator, had not God wiſely tempered hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man excellence with a certain conſciouſneſs of its own imperfection. But though this inevitable alloy of weakneſs may frequently be found in the beſt cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters,
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:024452_0073_0FC7471444E89398"/>
yet how can that be the ſource of triumph and exaltation to any, which, if properly weighed, muſt be the deepeſt motive of humiliation to all? A good-natured man will be ſo far from rejoicing, that he will be ſecretly troubled, whenever he reads that the greateſt Roman moraliſt was tainted with avarice, and the greateſt Britiſh philoſopher with venality.</p>
               <p>It is remarked by Pope, in his eſſay on criticiſm, that,
<q>Ten cenſure wrong, for one that writes amiſs.</q>
But I apprehend it does not therefore follow, that to judge is more difficult than to write. If this were the caſe, the critic would be ſuperior to the poet, whereas it appears to be directly the contrary.
<q>The critic, (ſays the great champion of Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare) but faſhions the body of a work; the poet muſt add the ſoul, which gives force and direction to its actions and geſtures.</q>
It ſhould ſeem, that the reaſon why ſo many more judge wrong, than write ill, is becauſe the number of readers is beyond all proportion greater than the number of writers. Every man who reads, is, in ſome meaſure, a critic, and, with very common abilities, may point out real faults and material errors in a very well written book: but it by no means follows, that he is able to write any thing comparable to the work which he is capable of cenſuring. And unleſs the numbers of thoſe who write, and of thoſe who judge, were more equal, the calculation ſeems not to be quite fair.</p>
               <p>A capacity for reliſhing works of genius is the indubitable ſign of good taſte. But if a proper diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and ability to enjoy the compoſitions of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, entitle a man to the claim of reputation, it is ſtill a far inferior degree of merit to his who can invent and produce thoſe compoſitions, the bare diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of which gives the critic no ſmall ſhare of fame.</p>
               <p>The preſident of the royal academy, in his admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>diſcourſe</hi> on <hi>imitation,</hi> has ſet the folly of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on unaſſiſted genius, in the cleareſt light;
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:024452_0074_0FC74715C82B4730"/>
and has ſhown the neceſſity of adding the knowledge of others, to our own native powers, in his uſual ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and maſterly manner. "The mind," ſays he,
<q>is a barren ſoil—is a ſoil ſoon exhauſted, and will produce no crop, or only one, unleſs it be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually fertilized, and enriched with foreign mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Yet it has been objected, that ſtudy is a great ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to originality; but even if this were true, it would perhaps be as well that an author ſhould give us the ideas of ſtill better writers, mixed and aſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated with the matter in his own mind, as thoſe crude and undigeſted thoughts, which he values under the notion that they are original. The ſweeteſt honey neither taſtes of the roſe, the honey-ſuckle, nor the carnation, yet it is compounded of the very eſſence of them all.</p>
               <p>If in the other fine arts, this accumulation of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is neceſſary, it is indiſpenſably ſo in poetry. It is a fatal raſhneſs for any one to truſt too much to his own ſtock of ideas. He muſt invigorate them by exerciſe, poliſh them by converſation, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe them by every ſpecies of elegant and virtuous knowledge, and the mind will not fail to reproduce with intereſt thoſe ſeeds, which are ſown in it by ſtudy and obſervation. Above all, let every one guard againſt the dangerous opinion, that he knows enough: an opinion that will weaken the energy and reduce the powers of the mind, which, though once perhaps vigorous and effectual, will be ſunk to a ſtate of literary imbecility, by cheriſhing vain and preſumptuous ideas of its own independence.</p>
               <p>For inſtance, it may not be neceſſary that a poet ſhould be deeply ſkilled in the Linnaean ſyſtem; but it muſt be allowed, that a general acquaintance with plants and flowers will furniſh him with a delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and profitable ſpecies of inſtruction. He is not obliged to trace nature in all her nice and varied operations, with the minute accuracy of a Boyle, or the laborious inveſtigation of a Newton; but his <hi>good ſenſe</hi> will point out to him, that no inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:024452_0075_0FC7471ED0565B98"/>
portion of philoſophical knowledge is requiſite to the completion of his literary character. The ſciences are more independent, and require little or no aſſiſtance from the graces of poetry: but poetry, if ſhe would charm and inſtruct, muſt not be ſo haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; ſhe muſt be contented to borrow of the ſciences, many of her choiceſt alluſions; and many of her moſt graceful embelliſhments; and does it not magnify the character of true poeſy, that ſhe includes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in herſelf all the ſcattered graces of every ſeparate art?</p>
               <p>The rules of the great maſters in criticiſm may not be ſo neceſſary to the forming a good taſte, as the examination of thoſe original mines from whence they drew their treaſures of knowledge.</p>
               <p>The three celebrated eſſays on the art of poetry do not teach ſo much by their laws as by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples; the dead letter of their rules is leſs inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive than the living ſpirit of their verſe. Yet theſe rules are to a young poet, what the ſtudy of loga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithms is to a young mathematician; they do not ſo much contribute to form his judgment, as afford him the ſatisfaction of convincing him that he i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> right. They do not preclude the difficulty of the operation; but at the concluſion of it, furniſh him with a f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ller demonſtration that he has proceeded on proper principles. When he has well ſtudied the maſters in whoſe ſchools the firſt critics formed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and fancies he has caught a ſpark of their divine flame, it may be a good method to try his own compoſitions by the teſt of the critic rules, ſo far, indeed, as the mechaniſm of poetry goes. If the examination be fair and candid, this trial, like the touch of Ithuriel's ſpear, will detect every la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent error, and bring to light every favourite fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Good taſte always ſuits the meaſure of its admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the merit of the compoſition it examines. It accommodates its praiſes, or its cenſure, to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence of a work, and appropriates it to the nature of it. General applauſe, or indiſcriminate abuſe, is
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:024452_0076_0FC7472043266968"/>
the ſign of a vulgar underſtanding. There are certain blemiſhes which the judicious and good-natured read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er will candidly overlook. But the falſe ſublime, the tumour which is intended for greatneſs, the diſtorted figure, the puerile conceit, and the incongruous meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor, theſe are defects for which ſcarcely any other kind of merit can atone. And yet there may be more hope of a writer (eſpecially if he be a young one) who is now and then guilty of ſome of theſe faults, than of one who avoids them all, not through judgment, but feebleneſs, and who, inſtead of deviating into er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, is continually falling ſhort of excellence. The mere abſence of error implies that moderate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior degree of merit with which a cold heart and a phlegmatic taſte will be better ſatisfied than with the magnificent irregularities of exalted ſpirits. It ſtretches ſome minds to an uneaſy extenſion, to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to attend to compoſitions ſuperlatively excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; and it contracts liberal ſouls to a painful nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowneſs to deſcend to books of inferior merit. A work of capital genius, to a man of an ordinary mind, is the bed of Procruſtes to one of a ſhort ſtature; the man is too little to fill up the ſpace aſſigned him, and undergoes the torture in attempting it: and a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, or low production to a man of bright talents, is the puniſhment inflicted by Mezentius; the living ſpirit has too much animation to endure patiently to be in contact with a dead body.</p>
               <p>Taſte ſeems to be a ſentiment of the ſoul, which gives the bias to opinion; for we feel before we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect. Without this ſentiment, all knowledge, learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and opinion, would be cold, inert materials; whereas they become active principles when ſtirred, kindled, and inflamed by this animating quality.</p>
               <p>There is another feeling, which is called enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſm. The enthuſiaſm of ſenſible hearts is ſo ſtrong, that it only yields to the impulſe with which ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing objects act on it; but ſuch hearts help on the effect by their own ſenſibility. In a ſcene where Shakeſpeare and Garrick give perfection to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the feeling heart does not merely accede to
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:024452_0077_0FC74721B5699D50"/>
the delirium they occaſion: it does more; it is ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured of it; it ſolicits the deluſion; it ſues to be deceived, and grudgingly cheriſhes the ſacred trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of its feelings. The poet and performer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in carrying us
<q>Beyond this viſible diurnal ſphere.</q>
They bear us aloft in their airy courſe, with unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted rapidity, if they meet not with any obſtruction from the coldneſs of our own feelings. Perhaps on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a few fine ſpirits can enter into the detail of their writing and acting: but the multitude do not enjoy leſs acutely, becauſe they are not able philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally to analyſe the ſources of their joy or ſorrow. If the others have the advantage of judging, theſe have at leaſt the privilege of feeling: and it is not from complaiſance to a few leading judges, that they burſt into peals of laughter, or melt into delightful agony; their hearts decide, and that is a deciſion from which there lies no appeal. It muſt, however, be confeſſed, that the nicer ſeparations of character, and the lighter and almoſt imperceptible ſhades which ſometimes diſtinguiſh them, will not be intimately reliſhed, unleſs there be a conſonancy of taſte as well as feeling in the ſpectators; though, where the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are principally concerned, the prophane vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar come in for a larger portion of the univerſal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, than critics and connoiſſeurs are willing to allow them.</p>
               <p>Yet enthuſiaſm, though the natural concomitant of genius, is no more genius itſelf, than drunkenneſs is cheerfulneſs: and that enthuſiaſm, which diſcovers itſelf on occaſions not worthy to excite it, is the mark of a wretched judgment and a falſe taſte.</p>
               <p>Nature produces innumerable objects: to imitate them, is the province of genius; to direct thoſe imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, is the property of judgment; to decide on their effects, is the buſineſs of taſte. For taſte, who ſits as ſupreme judge on the productions of genius, is not ſatisfied when ſhe merely imitates nature; ſhe muſt alſo, ſays an ingenious French writer, imitate
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:024452_0078_0FC747233830F2E0"/>
                  <hi>beautiful</hi> nature. It requires no leſs judgment to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject than to chooſe, and genius might imitate what is vulgar, under pretence that it was natural, if taſte did not carefully point out thoſe objects which are moſt proper for imitation. It alſo requires a very nice diſcernment to diſtinguiſh veriſimilitude from truth; for there is a truth in taſte nearly as conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive as demonſtration in mathematics.</p>
               <p>Genius, when in full impetuoſity of its career, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten touches on the very brink of error; and is, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, never ſo near the verge of the precipice, as when indulging its ſublimeſt flights. It is in thoſe great, but dangerous moments, that the curb of vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant judgment is moſt wanting: while ſafe and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber dulneſs obſerves one tedious and inſipid round of tireſome uniformity, and ſteers equally clear of ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centricity and of beauty. Dulneſs has few redundan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to retrench, few luxuriancies to pru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, and few irregularities to ſmooth. Theſe, though errors, are the errors of genius, for there is rarely redundancy without plenitude, or irregularity without greatneſs. The exceſſes of genius may eaſily be retrenched, but the deficiencies of dulneſs can never be ſupplied.</p>
               <p>Thoſe, who copy from others, will doubtleſs be leſs excellent than thoſe who copy from nature. To imitate imitators, is the way to depart too far from the great original herſelf. The later copies of an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graving retain fainter and fainter traces of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, to which the earlier impreſſions bore ſo ſtrong a reſemblance.</p>
               <p>It ſeems very extraordinary, that it ſhould be the moſt difficult thing in the world to be natural; and that it ſhould be harder to hit off the manners of real life, and to delineate ſuch characters as we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with every day, than to imagine ſuch as do not exiſt.

               <p>People do not always know what taſte they have, till it is awakened by ſome correſponding object; nay, genius itſelf is a fire, which in many minds

would never blaze, if not kindled by ſome external cauſe.</p>
               <p>Nature, that munificent mother, when ſhe beſtows the power of judging, accompanies it with the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of enjoying. The judgment, which is clear ſighted, points out ſuch objects as are calculated to inſpire love; and the heart inſtantaneouſly attaches itſelf to whatſoever is lovely.</p>
               <p>In regard to literary reputation, a great deal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the ſtate of learning in the particular age or nation, in which an author lives. In a dark and ignorant period, moderate knowledge will entitle its poſſeſſor to a conſiderable ſhare of fame; whereas, to be diſtinguiſhed in a polite and lettered age, requires ſtriking parts and deep erudition.</p>
               <p>When a nation begins to emerge from a ſtate of mental darkneſs, and to ſtrike out the firſt rudiments of improvement, it chalks out a few ſtrong but incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect ſketches, gives the rude out-lines of general art, and leaves the filling up to the leiſure of happier days, and the refinement of more enlightened times. Their drawing is a rude <hi>Sbozzo,</hi> and their poetry wild minſtrelſy.</p>
               <p>Perfection of taſte is a point which a nation no ſooner reaches, than it overſhoots; and it is more difficult to return to it, after having paſſed it, than it was to attain, when they fell ſhort of it. Where the arts begin to languiſh after having flouriſhed, they ſeldom, indeed, fall back to their original bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bariſm: but a certain feebleneſs of exertion takes place, and it is more difficult to recover them from this dying languor to their proper ſtrength, than it was to poliſh them from their former r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

which he has not power to uſe, but is obliged to ſee with the eyes, and hear through the ears of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men.</p>
               <p>A writer of correct taſte will hardly ever go out of his way, even in ſearch of embelliſhment; he will ſtudy to attain the beſt end by the moſt natural means; for he knows that what is not natural cannot be beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, and that nothing can be beautiful out of its own place; for an improper ſituation will convert the moſt ſtriking beauty into a glaring defect. When, by a well-connected chain of ideas, or a judicious ſucceſſion of events, the reader is ſnatched to
<q>Thebes or Athens,</q>
what can be more impertinent than for the poet to obſtruct the operation of the paſſion he has juſt been kindling, by introducing a conceit which contradicts his purpoſe, and interrupts his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! Indeed, we cannot be tranſported, even in idea, to thoſe places, if the poet does not manage ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droitly as not to make us ſenſible of the journey: the inſtant we feel we are travelling, the writer's art fails, and the delirium is at an end.</p>
               <p>Proſerpine, ſays Ovid, would have been reſtored to her mother Ceres, had not Aſcalaphus ſeen her ſtop to gather a golden apple, when the terms of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration were, that ſhe ſhould taſte nothing. A ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pregnant with inſtruction for lively writers, who, by neglecting the main buſineſs, and going out of the way for falſe gratifications, loſe ſight of the end they ſhould principally keep in view. It was this falſe taſte that introduced the numberleſs <hi>concetti,</hi> which diſgrace the brighteſt of the Italian poets; and this is the reaſon, why the reader only feels ſhort and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted ſnatches of delight, in peruſing the bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant but unequal compoſitions of Arioſto, inſtead of that unbroken and undiminiſhed pleaſure, which he conſtantly receives from Virgil, from Milton, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally from Taſſo. The firſt mentioned Italian is the Atalanta, who will interrupt the moſt eager ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer, to pick up the glittering miſchief; while the Mantuan and the Britiſh bards, like Hippomenes, preſs on warm in the purſuit, and unſeduced by temptation.</p>

                  <pb n="83" facs="unknown:024452_0081_0FC74742083CB038"/>A writer of real taſte will take great pains in the perfection of his ſtyle, to make the reader believe that he took none at all. The writing, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be moſt eaſy, will be generally found to be leaſt imutable. The moſt elegant verſes are the moſt eaſily retained; they faſten themſelves on the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, without its making any effort to preſerve them, and we are apt to imagine, that what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered with eaſe, was written without difficulty.</p>
               <p>To conclude: genius is a rare and precious gem, of which few know the worth; it is fitter for the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet of the connoiſſeur, than for the commerce of mankind. Good ſenſe is a bank-bill, convenient for change, negociable at all times, and current in all places. It knows the value of ſmall things, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders that an aggregate of them makes up the ſum of human affairs. It elevates common concerns into matters of importance, by performing them in the beſt manner, and at the moſt ſuitable ſeaſon. Good ſenſe carries with it the idea of equality, while genius is always ſuſpected of a deſign to impoſe the burden of ſuperiority; and reſpect is paid to it with that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance which always attends other impoſts, the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er orders of mankind generally repining moſt at de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, by which they are leaſt liable to be affected.</p>
               <p>As it is the character of genius to penetrate with a lynx's beam into unfathomable abyſſes and uncre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated worlds, and to ſee what is <hi>not,</hi> ſo it is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of good ſenſe to diſtinguiſh perfectly, and judge accurately what realy <hi>is.</hi> Good ſenſe has not ſo piercing an eye, but it has as clear a ſight. It does not penetrate ſo deeply, but as far as it <hi>does</hi> ſee, it diſcerns diſtinctly. Good ſenſe is a judicious mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic, who can produce beauty and convenience out of ſuitable means; but genius (I ſpeak with reverence of the immeaſurable diſtance) bears ſome remote re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance to the divine architect, who produced per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of beauty without any viſible materials, <hi>who ſpake, and it was created;</hi> who ſaid, <hi>let it be, and it was.</hi>

            <div type="preface">
               <head>PREFACE.</head>
               <p>THAT the ſubſequent letters were written by a tender father, in a declining ſtate of health, for the inſtruction of his daughters, and not intended for the public, is a circumſtance which will recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them to every one who conſiders them in the light of admonition and advice. In ſuch domeſtic intercourſe, no ſacrifices are made to prejudices, to cuſtoms, to faſhionable opinions. Paternal love, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal care, ſpeak their genuine ſentiments, undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed and unreſtained. A father's zeal for his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's improvement, in whatever can make a woman amiable, with a father's quick apprehenſion of the dangers that too often ariſe, even from the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that very point, ſuggeſt his admonitions, and render him attentive to a thouſand little graces and decorums, which would eſcape the niceſt moraliſt who ſhould undertake the ſubject on unintereſted ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. Every faculty is on the alarm, when the objects of ſuch tender affection are concerned.</p>
               <p>In the writer of theſe letters, paternal tenderneſs and vigilance were doubled, as he was at that time ſole parent; death having before deprived the young
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:024452_0083_0FC74745EA1091E8"/>
ladies of their excellent mother. His own precari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtate of health inſpired him with the moſt tender ſolicitude for their future welfare; and though he might have concluded, that the impreſſions made by his inſtructions and uniform example could never be effaced from the memory of his children, yet his anxiety for their orphan condition ſuggeſted to him this method of continuing to them thoſe advantages.</p>
               <p>The editor is encouraged to offer this treatiſe to the public, by the very favourable reception which the reſt of his father's works have met with. The comparative view of the ſtate of man and other ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, and the eſſay on the office and duties of a phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, have been very generally read; and, if he is not deceived by the partiality of his friends, he has reaſon to believe they have met with general approbation.</p>
               <p>In ſome of thoſe tracts, the author's object was to improve the taſte and underſtanding of his reader; in others, to mend his heart; in others, to point out to him the proper uſe of philoſophy, by ſhowing its application to the duties of common life. In all his writings, his chief view was the good of his fellow-creatures; and as thoſe among his friends, in whoſe taſte and judgment he moſt confided, think the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of this ſmall work will contribute to that general deſign, and at the ſame time do honour to his memory, the editor can no longer heſitate to comply with their advice, in communicating it to the public.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>YOU had the misfortune to be deprived of your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at a time of life when you were inſenſible of your loſs, and could receive little benefit either from her inſtruction or her example. Before this comes to your hands, you will likewiſe have loſt your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>I have had many melancholy reflexions on the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:024452_0084_0FC747487729B058"/>
and helpleſs ſituation you muſt be in, if it ſhould pleaſe God to remove me from you, before you ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at that period of life, when you will be able to think and act for yourſelves. I know mankind too well; I know their falſehood, their diſſipation, their coldneſs to all the duties of friendſhip and humanity. I know the little attention paid to helpleſs infancy. You will meet with few friends diſintereſted enough to do you good offices, when you are incapable of making them any return, by contributing to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt or their pleaſure, or even to the gratification of their vanity.</p>
               <p>I have been ſupported under the gloom naturally ariſing from theſe reflexions, by a reliance on the goodneſs of that providence which has hitherto pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved you, and given me the moſt pleaſing proſpect of the goodneſs of your diſpoſitions; and by the ſecret hope, that your mother's virtues will entail a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on her children.</p>
               <p>The anxiety I have for your happineſs, has made me reſolve to throw together my ſentiments relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your future conduct in life. If I live for ſome years, you will receive them with much greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, ſuited to your different geniuſes and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions. If I die ſooner, you muſt receive them in this very imperfec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> manner,—the laſt proof of my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
               <p>You will all remember your father's fondneſs, when perhaps every other circumſtance relating to him is forgotten. This remembrance, I hope, will induce you to give a ſerious attention to the advices I am now going to leave with you. I can requeſt this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention with the greater confidence, as my ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, on the moſt intereſting points that regard life and manners, were entirely correſpondent to your mother's, whoſe judgment and taſte I truſted much more than my own.</p>
               <p>You muſt expect that the advices which I ſhall give you, will be very imperfect, as there are many name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs delicacies in female manners, of which none but a woman can judge. You will have one advantage
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:024452_0085_0FC74749C6F16B88"/>
by attending to what I am going to leave with you; you will hear, at leaſt for once in your lives, the genuine ſentiments of a man who has no intereſt in flattering or deceiving you. I ſhall throw my reflex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions together without any ſtudied order, and ſhall only, to avoid confuſion, range them under a few ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral heads.</p>
               <p>You will ſee, in a little treatiſe of mine juſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, in what an honourable point of view I have conſidered your ſex,—not as domeſtic drudges, or the ſlaves of our pleaſures, but as our companions and equals—as deſigned to ſoften our hearts and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh our manners—and, as Thomſon finely ſays,
<q>
                     <l>To raiſe the virtues, animate the bliſs,</l>
                     <l>And ſweeten all the toils of human life.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall not repeat what I have there ſaid on this ſubject, and ſhall only obſerve, that from the view I have given of your natural character and place in ſociety, there ariſes a certain propriety of conduct, peculiar to your ſex. It is this peculiar propriety of female manners, of which I intend to give you my ſentiments, without touching on thoſe general rules of conduct by which men and women are equally bound.</p>
               <p>While I explain to you that ſyſtem of conduct which I think will tend moſt to your honour and happineſs, I ſhall, at the ſame time, endeavour to point out thoſe virtues and accompliſhments which render you moſt reſpectable and moſt amiable in the eyes of my own ſex.</p>

               <p>THOUGH the duties of religion, ſtrictly ſpeaking, are equally binding on both ſexes, yet certain differences in their natural character and education, render ſome vices in your ſex particularly odious. The natural hardneſs of our hearts, and ſtrength of our paſſions, inflamed by the uncontrouled licence we are too often indulged with in our youth, are apt to render our manners more diſſolute, and make us leſs
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:024452_0086_0FC74753ECBA0320"/>
ſuſceptible of the finer feelings of the heart. Your ſuperior delicacy, your modeſty, and the uſual ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of your education, preſerve you, in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, from any temptation to thoſe vices to which we are moſt ſubjected. The natural ſoftneſs and ſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of your diſpoſitions particularly fit you for the practice of thoſe duties where the heart is chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. And this, along with the natural warmth of your imagination, renders you peculiarly ſuſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible of the feelings of devotion.</p>
               <p>There are many circumſtances in your ſituation that peculiarly require the ſupports of religion, to enable you to act in them with ſpirit and propriety. Your whole life is often a life of ſuffering. You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not plunge into buſineſs, or diſſipate yourſelves in pleaſure and riot, as men too often do, when under the preſſure of misfortunes. You muſt bear your ſorrows in ſilence, unknown and unpitied. You muſt often put on a face of ſerenity and cheerfulneſs, when your hearts are torn with anguiſh, or ſinking in deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair. Then your only reſource is in the conſolations of religion. It is chiefly owing to theſe, that you bear domeſtic misfortunes better than we do.</p>
               <p>But you are ſometimes in very different circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that equally require the reſtraints of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The natural vivacity, and perhaps the natural vanity of your ſex, is very apt to lead you into a diſſipated ſtate of life, that deceives you under the appearance of innocent pleaſure; but which in reality waſtes your ſpirits, impairs your health, weakens all the ſuperior faculties of your minds, and often ſullies your reputations. Religion, by checking this diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, and rage for pleaſure, enables you to draw more happineſs, even from thoſe very ſources of amuſement, which, when too frequently applied to, are often productive of ſatiety and diſguſt.</p>
               <p>Religion is rather a matter of ſentiment than rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning. The important and intereſting articles of faith are ſufficiently plain. Fix your attention on theſe, and do not meddle with controverſy. If you get into that, you plunge into a chaos, from which
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:024452_0087_0FC74754E9068870"/>
you will never be able to extricate yourſelves. It ſpoils the temper, and, I ſuſpect, has no good effect on the heart.</p>
               <p>Avoid all books and all converſations that tend to ſhake your faith on thoſe great points of religion which ſhould ſerve to regulate your conduct, and on which your hopes of future and eternal happineſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend.</p>
               <p>Never indulge yourſelves in ridicule on religious ſubjects, nor give countenance to it in others by ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diverted with what they ſay. This, to people of good-breeding, will be a ſufficient check.</p>
               <p>I wiſh you to go no further than the ſcriptures for your religious opinions. Embrace thoſe you find clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly revealed. Never perplex yourſelves about ſuch as you do not underſtand, but treat them with ſilent and becoming reverence. I would adviſe you to read on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch religious books as are addreſſed to the heart, ſuch as inſpire pious and devout affections, ſuch as are proper to direct you in your conduct, and not ſuch as tend to entangle you in the endleſs maze of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſyſtems.</p>
               <p>Be punctual in the ſtated performance of your pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate devotions, morning and evening. If you have any ſenſibility or imagination, this will eſtabliſh ſuch an intercourſe between you and the Supreme Being, as will be of infinite conſequence to you in life. It will communicate an habitual cheerfulneſs to your tempers, give a firmneſs and ſteadineſs to your virtue, and enable you to go through all the viciſſitudes of human life with propriety and dignity.</p>
               <p>I wiſh you to be regular in your attendance on pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic worſhip, and in receiving the communion. Allow nothing to interrupt your public or private devotions, except the performance of ſome active duty in life, to which they ſhould always give place. In your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour at public worſhip, obſerve an exemplary at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and gravity.</p>
               <p>That extreme ſtrictneſs which I recommend to you in theſe duties, will be conſidered by many of your acquaintance as a ſuperſtitious attachment to forms;

               <p>Cultivate an enlarged charity for all mankind, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may differ from you in their religious opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.

               <p>Show your regard to religion by a diſtinguiſhing reſpect to all its miniſters, of whatever perſuaſion, who do not, by their lives, diſhonour their profeſſion; but never allow them the direction of your conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, leſt they taint you with the narrow ſpirit of their party.</p>
               <p>The beſt effect of your religion will be a diffuſive humanity to all in diſtreſs. Set apart a certain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of your income as ſacred to charitable pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. But in this, as well as in the practice of every other duty, carefully avoid oſtentation. Vanity is always defeating her own purpoſes. Fame is one of the natural rewards of virtue. Do not purſue her, and ſhe will follow you.</p>
               <p>Do not confine your charity to giving money. You may have many opportunities of ſhowing a tender and

compaſſionate ſpirit, where your money is not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. There is a falſe and unnatural refinement in ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, which makes ſome people ſhun the ſight of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very object in diſtreſs. Never indulge this, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly where your friends or acquaintances are concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Let the days of their misfortunes, when the world forgets or avoids them, be the ſeaſon for you to exerciſe your humanity and friendſhip. The ſight of human miſery ſoftens the heart, and makes it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: it checks the pride of health and proſperity, and the diſtreſs it occaſions, is amply compenſated by the conſciouſneſs of doing your duty, and by the ſecret endearment which nature has annexed to all our ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathetic ſorrows.</p>
               <p>Women are greatly deceived, when they think they recommend themſelves to our ſex, by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference about religion. Even thoſe men who are themſelves unbelievers, diſlike infidelity in you. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man, who knows human nature, connects a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious taſte in your ſex with ſoftneſs and ſenſibility of heart; at leaſt; we always conſider the want of it as a proof of that hard and maſculine ſpirit, which, of all your faults, we diſlike the moſt. Beſides, men conſider your religion as one of their principal ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities for that female virtue in which they are moſt intereſted. If a gentleman pretends an attachment to any of you, and endeavours to ſhake your religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous principles, be aſſured he is either a fool, or has deſigns on you, which he dares not openly avow.</p>
               <p>You will probably wonder at my having educated you in a church different from my own. The reaſon was plainly this: I looked on the differences between our churches to be of no real importance, and that a preference of one to the other was a mere matter of taſte. Your mother was educated in the church of England, and had an attachment to it; and I had a prejudice in favour of every thing ſhe liked. It never was her deſire, that you ſhould be baptiſed by a cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyman of the church of England, or be educated in that church. On the contrary, the delicacy of her regard, to the ſmalleſt circumſtance that could affect

me in the eye of the world, made her anxiouſly inſiſt it might be otherwiſe. But I could not yield to her in that kind of generoſity. When I loſt her, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſtill more determined to educate you in that church; as I feel a ſecret pleaſure in doing every thing that appears to me to expreſs my affection and veneration for her memory. I draw but a very faint and imperfect picture of what your mother was, while I endeavour to point out what you ſhould be.<note n="*" place="bottom">The reader will remember, that ſuch obſervations as reſpect equally both the ſexes, are all along as much as poſſible molded.</note>

               <head>Conduct and Behaviour.</head>
               <p>ONE of the chief beauties, in a female character, is that modeſt reſerve, that retiring delicacy, which avoids the public eye, and is diſconcerted even at the gaze of admiration. I do not wiſh you to be inſenſible to applauſe; if you were, you muſt become, if not worſe, at leaſt leſs amiable women: but you may be dazzled by that admiration which yet rejoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces your hearts.</p>
               <p>When a girl ceaſes to bluſh, ſhe has loſt the moſt powerful charm of beauty. That extreme ſenſibility which it indicates, may be a weakneſs and incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance in our ſex, as I have too often felt, but in yours it is peculiarly engaging. Pedants, who think themſelves philoſophers, aſk why a woman ſhould bluſh, when ſhe is conſcious of no crime? It is a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient anſwer, that nature has made you to bluſh when you are guilty of no fault, and has forced us to love you, becauſe you do ſo.—Bluſhing is ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neceſſarily an attendant on guilt, that it is the uſual companion of innocence.</p>
               <p>This modeſty, which I think ſo eſſential in your ſex, will naturally diſpoſe you to be rather ſilent in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, eſpecially in a large one.—People of ſenſe and diſcernment will never miſtake ſuch ſilence for dull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. One may take a ſhare in converſation without uttering a ſyllable. The expreſſion in the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:024452_0091_0FC7475DED079680"/>
ſhows it, and this never eſcapes an obſerving eye.</p>
               <p>I ſhould be glad that you had an eaſy dignity in your behaviour at public places, but not that confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent eaſe, that unabaſhed countenance, which ſeems to ſet the company at defiance. If, while a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is ſpeaking to you, one of ſuperior rank addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes you, do not let your eager attention and viſible preference betray the flutter of your heart: let your pride on this occaſion preſerve you from that mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, into which your vanity would ſink you. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that you expoſe yourſelves to the ridicule of the company, and affront one gentleman only to ſwell the triumph of another, who perhaps thinks he does you honour in ſpeaking to you.</p>
               <p>Converſe with men even of the firſt rank with that dignified modeſty which may prevent the approach of the moſt diſtant familiarity, and conſequently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent them from feeling themſelves your ſuperiors.</p>
               <p>Wit is the moſt dangerous talent you can poſſeſs. It muſt be guarded with great diſcretion and good nature; otherwiſe it will create you many enemies. Wit is perfectly conſiſtent with ſoftneſs and delicacy; yet they are ſeldom found united. Wit is ſo flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to vanity, that they who poſſeſs it, become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicated, and loſe all ſelf-command.</p>
               <p>Humour is a different quality. It will make your company much ſolicited; but be cautious how you indulge it. It is often a great enemy to delicacy, and a ſtill greater one to dignity of character. It may ſometimes gain you applauſe, but will never procure you reſpect.</p>
               <p>Be even cautious of diſplaying your good ſenſe. It will be thought you aſſume a ſuperiority over the reſt of the company. But if you happen to have any learning, keep it a profound ſecret, eſpecially from the men, who generally look with a jealous and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant eye on a woman of great parts, and a culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated underſtanding.</p>
               <p>A man of real genius and candour is far ſuperior to this meanneſs; but ſuch a one will ſeldom fall in

               <p>Beware of detraction, eſpecially where your own ſex are concerned. You are generally accuſed of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing particularly addicted to this vice—I think, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly. Men are equally guilty of it when their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts interfere. As your intereſts more frequently claſh, and as your feelings are quicker than ours, your temptations to it are more frequent: for this reaſon be particularly tender of the reputation of your own ſex, eſpecially when they happen to rival you in our regard. We look on this as the ſtrongeſt proof of dignity and true greatneſs of mind.</p>
               <p>Show a compaſſionate ſympathy to unfortunate wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, eſpecially to thoſe who are rendered ſo by the villainy of men. Indulge a ſecret pleaſure, I may ſay pride, in being the friends and refuge of the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, but without the vanity of ſhowing it.</p>
               <p>Conſider every ſpecies of indelicacy in converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as ſhameful in itſelf, and as highly diſguſting to us. All double entendre is of this ſort. The diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteneſs of men's education allows them to be divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a kind of wit, which yet they have delicacy enough to be ſhocked at, when it comes from your mouths, or even when you hear it without pain and contempt.—Virgin purity is of ſuch a delicate na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that it cannot bear certain things without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamination. It is always in your power to avoid theſe. No man, but a brute or a fool, will inſult a woman with converſation which he ſees gives her pain; nor will he dare to do it, if ſhe reſent the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury with a becoming ſpirit. There is a dignity in conſcious virtue, which is able to awe the moſt ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and abandoned of men.</p>

                  <pb n="96" facs="unknown:024452_0093_0FC7477F7888E298"/>You will be reproached perhaps with prudery. By prudery is uſually meant an affectation of delicacy: Now I do not wiſh you to affect delicacy; I wiſh you to poſſeſs it: at any rate, it is better to run the riſk of being thought ridiculous than diſguſting.</p>
               <p>The men will complain of your reſerve. They will aſſure you, that a franker behaviour would make you more amiable. But, truſt me, they are not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere when they tell you ſo. I acknowledge, that on ſome occaſions it might render you more agreeable as companions, but it would make you leſs amiable as women—an important diſtinction, which many of your ſex are not aware of. After all, I wiſh you to have great eaſe and openneſs in your converſation; I only point out ſome conſiderations which ought to regulate your behaviour in that reſpect.</p>
               <p>Have a ſacred regard to truth. Lying is a mean and deſpicable vice. I have known ſome women of excellent parts, who were ſo much addicted to it, that they could not be truſted in the relation of any ſtory, eſpecially if it contained any thing of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous, or if they themſelves were the heroines of the tale. This weakneſs did not proceed from a bad heart, but was merely the effect of vanity, or an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridled imagination. I do not mean to cenſure that lively embelliſhment of a humourous ſtory, which is only intended to promote innocent mirth.</p>
               <p>There is a certain gentleneſs of ſpirit and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners extremely engaging in your ſex—not that indiſcriminate attention, that unmeaning ſimper, which ſmiles on all alike. This ariſes either from an affectation of ſoftneſs, or from perfect inſipidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>There is a ſpecies of refinement in luxury, juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to prevail among the gentlemen of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, to which our ladies are yet as great ſtrangers as any women upon earth; I hope, for the honour of the ſex, that they may ever continue ſo; I mean, the luxury of eating. It is a deſpicable, ſelfiſh vice in men; but in your ſex it is beyond expreſſion indeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and diſguſting.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="unknown:024452_0094_0FC74781002C0588"/>Every one, who remembers a few years back, is ſenſible of a very ſtriking change in the attention and reſpect formerly paid by the gentlemen to the ladies: their drawing-rooms are deſerted: and after dinner and ſupper, the gentlemen are impatient till they retire. How they came to loſe this reſpect, which nature and politeneſs ſo well entitle them to, I ſhall not here particularly enquire. The revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of manners in any country depend on cauſes very various and complicated. I ſhall only obſerve, that the behaviour of the ladies in the laſt age was very reſerved and ſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>A fine woman, like other fine things in nature, has her proper point of view, from which ſhe may be ſeen to moſt advantage. To fix this point requires great judgment, and an intimate knowledge of the human heart. By the preſent mode of female man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, the ladies ſeem to expect that they ſhall regain their acendency over us—by the fulleſt diſplay of their perſonal charms—by being always in our eye at public places—by converſing with us, with the ſame unreſerved freedom as we do with one another —in ſhort, by reſembling us as nearly as they poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly can.—But a little time and experience will ſhow the folly of this expectation and conduct.</p>
               <p>The power of a fine woman over the hearts of men, of men of the fineſt parts, is even beyond what ſhe conceives. They are ſenſible of the pleaſing illuſion; but they cannot, nor do they wiſh to diſſolve it. But if ſhe is determined to diſpel the charm, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> certainly is in her power; ſhe may ſoon reduce the angel to a very ordinary girl.</p>
               <p>There is a native dignity in ingenuous modeſty to be expected in your ſex, which is your natural pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection from the familiarities of the men, and which you ſhould feel previous to the reflexion, that it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

of beauty ſhould be reſerved to bleſs the arms of the happy man to whom you give your heart, but who, if he has the leaſt delicacy, will deſpiſe them if he knows that they have been proſtituted to fifty men before him. The ſentiment, that a woman may allow all innocent freedoms, provided her virtue is ſecure, is both groſsly indelicate and dangerous, and has proved fatal to many of your ſex.</p>
               <p>Let me now recommend to your attention that elegance, which is not ſo much a quality itſelf, as the high poliſh of every other. It is what diffuſes an ineffable grace over every look, every motion, every ſentence you utter; it gives that charm to beauty, without which it generally fails to pleaſe. It is partly a perſonal quality, in which reſpect it is the gift of nature; but I ſpeak of it principally as a quality of the mind. In a word, it is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of taſte in life and manners—every virtue and every excellency in their moſt graceful and amiable forms.</p>
               <p>You may perhaps think, that I want to throw eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſpark of nature out of your compoſition, and to make you entirely artificial. Far from it. I wiſh you to poſſeſs the moſt perfect ſimplicity of heart and manners.

               <head>Amuſements.</head>
               <p>EVERY period of life has amuſements which are natural and proper to it. You may indulge the variety of your taſtes in theſe, while you keep with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the bounds of that propriety which is ſuitable to your ſex.</p>
               <p>Some amuſements are conducive to health; as vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous kinds of exerciſe: ſome are connected with qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities really uſeful; as different kinds of women's

work, and all the domeſtic concerns of a family: ſome are elegant accompliſhments; as dreſs, dancing, muſic, and drawing. Such books as improve your underſtanding, enlarge your knowledge, and cultivate your taſte, may be conſidered in a higher point of view than mere amuſements. There are a variety of others, which are neither uſeful nor ornamental, ſuch as play of different kinds.</p>
               <p>I would particularly recommend to you thoſe exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes that oblige you to be much abroad in the open air, ſuch as walking, and riding on horſeback. This will give vigour to your conſtitutions, and a bloom to your complexions. If you accuſtom yourſelves to go abroad always in chairs and carriages, you will ſoon become ſo enervated, as to be unable to go out of doors without them. They are, like moſt articles of luxury, uſeful and agreeable when judiciouſly uſed; but, when made habitual, they become both inſipid and pernicious.</p>
               <p>An attention to your health is a duty you owe to yourſelves and to your friends. Bad health ſeldom fails to have an influence on the ſpirits and temper. The fineſt geniuſes, the moſt delicate minds, have very frequently a correſpondent delicacy of bodily conſtitution, which they are too apt to neglect. Their luxury lies in reading and late hours, equal enemies to health and beauty.</p>
               <p>But though good health be one of the greateſt bleſſings of life, never make a boaſt of it, but enjoy it in grateful ſilence. We ſo naturally aſſociate the idea of female ſoftneſs and delicacy with a coreſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent delicacy of conſtitution, that when a woman ſpeaks of her great ſtrength, her extraordinary ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, her ability to bear exceſſive fatigue, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coil at a deſcription in a way ſhe is little aware of.</p>

to fill up, in a tolerably agreeable way, ſome of the many ſolitary hours you muſt neceſſarily paſs at home. It is a great article in the happineſs of life, to have your pleaſures as independent of others as poſſible.</p>
               <p>By continually gadding abroad, in ſearch of amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, you loſe the reſpect of all your acquaintances, whom you oppreſs with thoſe viſits, which, by a more diſcreet management, might have been courted.</p>
               <p>The domeſtic economy of a family is entirely a woman's province, and furniſhes a variety of ſubjects for the exertion both of good ſenſe and good taſte. If you ever come to have the charge of a family, it ought to engage much of your time and attention; nor can you be excuſed from this by any extent of fortune, though, with a narrow one, the ruin that follows the neglect of it may be more immediate.</p>
               <p>I am at the greateſt loſs what to adviſe you in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to books. There is no impropriety in your reading hiſtory, or cultivating any art or ſcience to which genius or accident lead you. The whole vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of nature lies open to your eye, and furniſhes an infinite variety of entertainment. If I was ſure that nature had given you ſuch ſtrong principles of taſte and ſentiment as would remain with you, and influence your future conduct, with the utmoſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure would I endeavour to direct your reading in ſuch a way as might form that taſte to the utmoſt perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of truth and elegance.
<q>But when I reflect how eaſy it is to warm a girl's imagination, and how difficult deeply and permanently to affect her heart—how readily ſhe enters into every refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſentiment, and how eaſily ſhe can ſacrifice them to vanity or convenience</q>
—I think I may very probably do you an injury by artificially crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a taſte, which, if nature never gave it you, would only ſerve to embarraſs your future conduct. I do not want to <hi>make</hi> you any thing: I want to know what nature has made you, and to perfect you o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="101" facs="unknown:024452_0098_0FC73DA842AB49E0"/>
as your hearts ſo thoroughly approve, that you would not forego them for any conſideration this world could offer.</p>
               <p>Dreſs is an important article in female life. The love of dreſs is natural to you, and therefore it is proper and reaſonable. Good ſenſe will regulate your expenſe in it; and good taſte will direct you to dreſs in ſuch a way, as to conceal any blemiſhes, and ſet off your beauties, if you have any, to the greateſt advantage. But much delicacy and judgment are required in the application of this rule. A fine wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhows her charms to moſt advantage, when ſhe ſeems moſt to conceal them. The fineſt boſom in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not ſo fine as what imagination forms. The moſt perfect elegance of dreſs appears always the moſt eaſy, and the leaſt ſtudied.</p>
               <p>Do not confine your attention to dreſs to your pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic appearances. Accuſtom yourſelves to an habitual neatneſs, ſo that in the moſt careleſs undreſs, in your moſt unguarded hours, you may have no reaſon to be aſhamed of your appearance. You will not eaſily believe how much we conſider your dreſs as expreſſive of your characters. Vanity, levity, ſlovenlineſs, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, appear through it. An elegant ſimplicity is an equal proof of taſte and delicacy.</p>
               <p>In dancing, the principal points you are to attend to, are eaſe and grace. I would have you to dance with ſpirit; but never allow yourſelves to be ſo far tranſported with mirth, as to forget the delicacy of your ſex. Many a girl dancing in the gaiety and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence of her heart, is thought to diſcover a ſpirit ſhe little dreams of.</p>
               <p>I know no entertainment that gives ſuch pleaſure to any perſon of ſentiment or humour, as the theatre. But I am ſorry to ſay, there are few Engliſh comedies a lady can ſee, without a ſhock to delicacy. You will not readily ſuſpect the comments gentlemen make on your behaviour on ſuch occaſions. Men are often beſt acquainted with the moſt worthleſs of your ſex, and from them too readily form their judgment of the reſt. A virtuous girl often hears very indelicate

Yet this is, moſt ungenerouſly, aſcribed to that command of features, and that ready preſence of mind, which you are thought to poſſeſs in a degree far beyond us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or, by ſtill more malignant obſervers, it is aſcribed to hardened effrontery.</p>
               <p>Sometimes a girl laughs with all the ſimplicity of unſuſpecting innocence, for no other reaſon but being infected with other people's laughing: ſhe is then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to know more than ſhe ſhould do. If ſhe does happen to underſtand an improper thing, ſhe ſuffers a very complicated diſtreſs; ſhe feels her modeſty hurt in the moſt ſenſible manner, and at the ſame time is aſhamed of appearing conſcious of the injury. The only way to avoid theſe inconveniencies, is never to go to a play that is particularly offenſive to delicacy. Tragedy ſubjects you to no ſuch diſtreſs. Its ſorrows will ſoften and ennoble your hearts.</p>
               <p>I need ſay little about gaming, the ladies in this country being as yet almoſt ſtrangers to it. It is a ruinous and incurable vice; and as it leads to all the ſelfiſh and turbulent paſſions, is peculiarly odious in your ſex. I have no objection to your playing a little at any kind of game, as a variety in your amuſements, provided that what you can poſſibly loſe is ſuch a trifle as can neither intereſt you, nor hurt you.</p>
               <p>In this, as well as in all important points of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, ſhow a determined reſolution and ſteadineſs. This is not in the leaſt inconſiſtent with that ſoftneſs and gentleneſs ſo amiable in your ſex. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it gives that ſpirit to a mild and ſweet diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without which it is apt to degenerate into inſipidity.

                  </gap>oice of friends will be of the utmoſt conſequence to you, as they may aſſiſt you by their advice and good offices. But the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate gratification which friendſhip affords to a warm, open, and ingenuous heart, is of itſelf a ſufficient motive to court it.</p>
               <p>In the choice of your friends, have your principal regard to goodneſs of heart and fidelity. If they alſo poſſeſs taſte and genius, that will ſtill make them more agreeable and uſeful companions. You have particular reaſon to place confidence in thoſe who have ſhown affection for you in your early days, when you were incapable of making them any return. This is an obligation for which you cannot be too grateful. When you read this, you will naturally think of your mother's friend, to whom you owe ſo much.</p>
               <p>If you have the good fortune to meet with any who deſerve the name of friends, unboſom yourſelves to them with the moſt unſuſpicious confidence. It is one of the world's maxims, never to truſt any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with a ſecret, the diſcovery of which could give you any pain: but it is the maxim of a little mind and a cold heart, unleſs where it is the effect of fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent diſappointments and bad uſage. An open tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, if reſtrained but by tolerable prudence, will make you, on the whole, much happier than a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, ſuſpicious one, although you may ſometimes ſuffer by it. Coldneſs and diſtruſt are but the too certain conſequences of age and experience: but they are unpleaſant feelings, and need not be anticipated before their time.</p>
               <p>But however open you may be in talking of your affairs, never diſcloſe the ſecret of one friend to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. Theſe are ſacred depoſits, which do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to you, nor have you any right to make uſe of them.</p>
               <p>There is another caſe, in which I ſuſpect it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to be ſecret, not ſo much from motives of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as delicacy; I mean in love matters. Though a woman has no reaſon to be aſhamed of an attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:024452_0101_0FC73DAFB6438A60"/>
to a man of merit, yet nature, whoſe authority is ſuperior to philoſophy, has annexed a ſenſe of ſhame to it. It is even long before a woman of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy dares avow to her own heart that ſhe loves; and when all the ſubterfuges of ingenuity to conceal it from herſelf fail, ſhe feels a violence done both to her pride and to her modeſty. This, I ſhould ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, muſt always be the caſe where ſhe is not ſure of a return to her attachment.</p>
               <p>In ſuch a ſituation, to lay the heart open to any perſon whatever, does not appear to me conſiſtent with the perfection of female delicacy. But perhaps I am in the wrong. At the ſame time I muſt tell you, that, in point of prudence, it concerns you to attend well to the conſequences of ſuch a diſcovery. Theſe ſecrets, however important in your own eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ion, may apper very trifling to your friend, who poſſibly will not enter into your feelings, but may rather conſider them as a ſubject of pleaſantry. For this reaſon, love ſecrets are of all others the worſt kept. But the conſequences to you may be very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, as no man of ſpirit and delicacy ever valued a heart much hacknied in the ways of love.</p>
               <p>If, therefore, you muſt have a friend to pour out your heart to, be ſure of her honour and ſecrecy. Let her not be a married woman, eſpecially if ſhe lives happily with her huſband. There are certain unguarded moments, in which ſuch a woman, though the beſt and worthieſt of her ſex, may let hints eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, which, at other times, or to any other perſon than her huſband, ſhe would be incapable of; nor will a huſband in this caſe feel himſelf under the ſame obligation of ſecrecy and honour, as if you had put your confidence originally in himſelf, eſpecially on a ſubject which the world is apt to treat ſo lightly.</p>
               <p>If all other circumſtances are equal, there are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious advantages in your making friends of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The ties of blood, and your being ſo much united in one common intereſt, form an additional bond of union to your friendſhip. If your brothers ſhould have the good fortune to have hearts ſuſcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:024452_0102_0FC73DB135CC3F50"/>
of friendſhip, to poſſeſs truth, honour, ſenſe, and delicacy of ſentiment, they are the fitteſt and moſt unexceptionable confidants. By placing confidence in them, you will receive every advantage which you could hope for from the friendſhip of men, without any of the inconveniencies that attend ſuch connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with our ſex.</p>
               <p>Beware of making confidants of your ſervants. Dignity not properly underſtood very readily degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates into pride, which enters into no friendſhip, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it cannot bear an equal, and is ſo fond of flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery as to graſp at it even from ſervants and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants. The moſt intimate confidants, therefore, of proud people, are valets-de-chambre and waiting wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Show the utmoſt humanity to your ſervants; make their ſituation as comfortable to them as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: but if you make them your confidants, you ſpoil them, and debaſe themſelves.</p>
               <p>Never allow any perſon, under the pretended ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of friendſhip, to be ſo familiar as to loſe a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per reſpect to you. Never allow them to teaze you on any ſubject that is diſagreeable, or where you have once taken your reſolution. Many will tell you, that this reſerve is inconſiſtent with the freedom which friendſhip allows: but a certain reſpect is as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in friendſhip as in love. Without it you may be liked as a child, but you will never be beloved as an equal.</p>
               <p>The temper and diſpoſition of the heart in your ſex make you enter more readily and warmly into friendſhips than men. Your natural propenſity to it is ſo ſtrong, that you often run into intimacies which you ſoon have ſufficient cauſe to repent of; and this makes your friendſhips ſo very fluctuating.</p>
               <p>Another great obſtacle to the ſincerity, as well as ſteadineſs of your friendſhips, is the great claſhing of your intereſts, in the purſuits of love, ambition, or vanity. For theſe reaſons, it would appear, at firſt view, more eligible for you to contract your friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips with the men. Among other obvious advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of an eaſy intercourſe between the two ſexes,
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:024452_0103_0FC73DB870373B30"/>
it occaſions an emulation and exertion in each to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel and be agreeable; hence their reſpective excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies are mutually communicated and blended. As their intereſts in no degree interfere, there can be no foundation for jealouſy, or ſuſpicion of rivalſhip. The friendſhip of a man for a woman is always blended with tenderneſs, which he never feels for one of his own ſex, even where love is in no degree concerned. Beſides, we are conſcious of a natural title you have to our protection and good offices, and therefore we feel an additional obligation of honour to ſerve you, and to obſerve an inviolable ſecrecy, whenever you confide in us.</p>
               <p>But apply theſe obſervations with great caution. Thouſands of women of the beſt hearts and fineſt parts have been ruined by men who approach them under the ſpecious name of friendſhip. But ſuppoſing a man to have the moſt undoubted honour, yet his friendſhip to a woman is ſo near a-kin to love, that if ſhe be very agreeable in her perſon, ſhe will probably very ſoon find a lover, where ſhe only wiſhed to meet a friend. Let me here, however, warn you againſt that weakneſs ſo common among vain women—the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, that every man, who takes particular notice of you, is a lover. Nothing can expoſe you more to ridicule than the taking up a man on the ſuſpicion of being your lover, who perhaps never once thought of you in that view, and giving yourſelves thoſe airs ſo common among all ſilly women on ſuch occaſions.</p>
               <p>There is a kind of unmeaning gallantry much prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed by ſome men, which, if you have any diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, you will find really very harmleſs. Men of this ſort will attend you to public places, and be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to you by a number of little obſervances, which thoſe of a ſuperior claſs do not ſo well underſtand, or have not leiſure to regard, or perhaps are too proud to ſubmit to. Look on the compliments of ſuch men as words of courſe, which they repeat to every agreeable woman of their acquaintance. There is a familiarity they are apt to aſſume, which a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per dignity in your behaviour will be eaſily able to check.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="unknown:024452_0104_0FC73DBB60D1F658"/>There is a different ſpecies of men whom you may like as agreeable companions, men of worth, taſte, and genius, whoſe converſation, in ſome reſpects, may be ſuperior to what you generally meet with among your own ſex. It will be fooliſh in you to deprive yourſelves of an uſeful and agreeable acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, merely becauſe idle people ſay he is your lover. Such a man may like your company, without having any deſign on your perſon.</p>
               <p>People whoſe ſentiments, and particularly whoſe taſtes correſpond, naturally like to aſſociate together, although neither of them have the moſt diſtant view of any further connexion. But as this ſimilarity of minds often gives riſe to a more tender attachment than friendſhip, it will be prudent to keep a watchful eye over yourſelves, leſt your hearts become too far engaged before you are aware of it. At the ſame time, I do not think that your ſex, at leaſt in this part of the world, have much of that ſenſibility which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to ſuch attachments. What is commonly called love among you is rather gratitude, and a partiality to the man who prefers you to the reſt of your ſex; and ſuch a man you often marry, with little of either perſonal eſteem or affection. Indeed, without an unuſual ſhare of natural ſenſibility, and very peculiar good fortune, a woman in this country has very little probability of marrying for love.<note n="*" place="bottom">Theſe obſervations are hap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It is a maxim laid down among you, and a very prudent one it is, that love is not to begin on your part; but is entirely to be the conſequence of our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to you. Now, ſuppoſing a woman to have ſenſe and taſte, ſhe will not find many men to whom ſhe can poſſibly be ſuppoſed to bear any conſiderable ſhare of eſteem. Among theſe few, it is very great chance if any of them diſtinguiſhes her particularly. Love, at leaſt with us, is exceedingly capricious, and will not always fix, where reaſon ſays it ſhould. But ſuppoſing one of them ſhould become particularly
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:024452_0105_0FC73DBDFB4128B0"/>
attached to her, it is ſtill extremely improbable that he ſhould be the man in the world her heart moſt approves of.</p>
               <p>As, therefore, nature has not given you that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited range in your choice which we enjoy, ſhe has wiſely and benevolently aſſigned to you a greater flexibility of taſte on this ſubject. Some agreeable qualities recommend a gentleman to your common good liking and friendſhip. In the courſe of his acquaintance, he contracts an attachment to you. When you perceive it, it excites your gratitude: this gratitude riſes into a preference: and this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, perhaps, at laſt advances to ſome degree of attachment, eſpecially if it meets with croſſes and difficulties; for theſe, and a ſtate of ſuſpenſe, are very great incitements to attachment, and are the food of love in both ſexes. If attachment was not excited in your ſex in this manner, there is not one of a million of you, that could ever marry with any degree of love.</p>
               <p>A man of taſte and delicacy marries a woman, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he loves her more that any other. A woman of equal taſte and delicacy marries him becauſe ſhe eſteems him, and becauſe he gives her that prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. But if a man unfortunately becomes attached to a woman whoſe heart is ſecretly pre-engaged, his attachment, inſtead of obtaining a ſuitable return, is particularly offenſive; and if he perſiſts to teaze her, he makes himſelf equally the object of her ſcorn and averſion.</p>
               <p>The effects of love among men are diverſified by their different tempers. An artful man may coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit every one of them ſo eaſily, as to impoſe on a young girl of an open, generous, and feeling heart, if ſhe be not extremely on her guard. The fineſt parts in ſuch a girl may not always prove ſufficient for her ſecurity. The dark and crooked paths of cunning are unſearchable and inconceivable to an honourable and elevated mind.</p>
               <p>The following, I apprehend, are the moſt genuine effects of an honourable paſſion among the men, and
<pb facs="unknown:024452_0106_0FC73DC046F839B8"/>
                  <pb n="109" facs="unknown:024452_0107_0FC73DC1B5B28178"/>
the moſt difficult to counterfeit. A man of delicacy often betrays his paſſion by his too great anxiety to conceal it, eſpecially if he has little hopes of ſucceſs. True love, in all its ſtages, ſeeks concealment, and never expects ſucceſs. It renders a man not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful, but timid to the higheſt degree, in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour to the woman he loves. To conceal the awe ſhe inſpires him with, he may ſometimes affect pleaſantry; but it ſits aukwardly on him, and he quickly relapſes into ſeriouſneſs, if not into dullneſs. He magnifies all her real perfections in his imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and is either blind to her failings, or converts them into beauties. Like a perſon conſcious of guilt, he is jealous that every eye obſerves his; and to avoid this, he ſhuns all the little obſervances of common gallantry.</p>
               <p>His heart and his character will be improved in every reſpect by his attachment. His manners will become more gentle, and his converſation more agreeable: but diffidence and embarraſſment will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways make him appear to diſadvantage in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of his miſtreſs. If the faſcination continue long<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it will totally depreſs his ſpirits, and extinguiſh every active, vigorous, and manly principle of his mind. You will find this ſubject beautifully and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetically painted in Thomſon's Spring.</p>
               <p>When you obſerve, in a gentleman's behaviour, theſe marks which I have deſcribed above, reflect ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly what you are to do. If his attachment be agreeable to you, I leave you to do as nature, good ſenſe, and delicacy ſhall direct you. If you love him, let me adviſe you never to diſcover to him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he full extent of your love, no not although you marry him. That ſufficiently ſhows your preference, which is all he is entitled to know. If he has delicacy, he will aſk for no ſtronger proof of affection, for your ſake; if he has ſenſe, he will not aſk it for his own. This is an unpleaſant truth; but it is my duty to let you know it. Violent love cannot ſubſiſt, at leaſt cannot be expreſſed, for any time together, on both ſides; otherwiſe the certain conſequence, however
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:024452_0108_0FC73DC83672F700"/>
concealed, is ſatiety and diſguſt. Nature in this caſe has laid the reſerve on you.</p>
               <p>If you ſee evident proofs of a gentleman's attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and are determined to ſhut your heart againſt him, as you ever hope to be uſed with generoſity by the perſon who ſhall engage your own heart, treat him honourably and humanely. Do not let him lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in a miſerable ſuſpenſe; but be anxious to let him know your ſentiments with regard to him.</p>
               <p>However people's hearts may deceive them, there is ſcarcely a perſon that can love for any time, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out at leaſt ſome diſtant hope of ſucceſs. If you really wiſh to undeceive a lover, you may do it in a variety of ways. There is a certain ſpecies of eaſy familiarity in your behaviour, which may ſatisfy him, if he has any diſcernment left, that he has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to hope for. But perhaps your particular tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per may not admit of this: you may eaſily ſhow that you want to avoid his company; but if he be a man whoſe friendſhip you wiſh to preſerve, you may not chooſe this method, becauſe then you loſe him in every capacity. You may get a common friend to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain matters to him, or fall on many other devices, if you be ſeriouſly anxious to put him out of ſuſpenſe.</p>
               <p>But if you be reſolved againſt every ſuch method, at leaſt do not ſhun opportunities of letting him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain himſelf. If you do this, you act barbarouſly and unjuſtly. If he brings you to an explanation, give him a polite, but reſolute and deciſive anſwer. In whatever way you convey your ſentiments to him, if he is a man of ſpirit and delicacy, he will give you no further trouble, nor apply to your friends for their interceſſion. This laſt is a method of court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which every man of ſpirit will diſdain. He will never whine nor ſue for your pity: that would mortify him almoſt as much as your ſcorn. In ſhort, you may poſſibly break ſuch a heart, but you can never bend it. Great pride always accompanies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy, however concealed under the appearance of the utmoſt gentleneſs and modeſty, and is the paſſion of all others the moſt difficult to conquer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="unknown:024452_0109_0FC73DCD84BB2A98"/>There is a caſe where a woman may coquette juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifiably to the utmoſt verge which her conſcience will allow. It is where a gentleman purpoſely declines to make his addreſſes, till ſuch time as he thinks himſelf perfectly ſure of her conſent. This, at bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, is intended to force a woman to give up the undoubted privilege of her ſex, the privilege of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing; it is intended to force her to explain herſelf, in effect, before the gentleman deigns to do it, and by this means to oblige her to violate the modeſty and delicacy of her ſex, and to invert the cleareſt order of nature. All this ſacrifice is propoſed to be made merely to gratify a moſt deſpicable vanity in a man, who would degrade the very woman whom he wiſhes to make his wife.</p>
               <p>It is of great importance to diſtinguiſh whether a gentleman who has the appearance of being your lover, delays to ſpeak explicitly, from the motive I have mentioned, or from a diffidence inſeparable from true attachment. In the one caſe, you can ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſe him too ill; in the other, you ought to uſe him with great kindneſs: and the greateſt kindneſs you can ſhow him, if you are determined not to liſten to his addreſſes, is to let him know it as ſoon as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
               <p>I know the many excuſes with which women en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to juſtify themſelves to the world, and to their own conſciences, when they act otherwiſe. Sometimes they plead ignorance, or at leaſt uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, of the gentleman's real ſentiments. That may ſometimes be the caſe. Sometimes they plead the decorum of their ſex, which enjoins an equal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour to all men, and forbids them to conſider any man as a lover till he has directly told them ſo. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps few women carry their ideas of female delicacy and decorum ſo far as I do. But I muſt ſay, you are not entitled to plead the obligation of theſe virtues, in oppoſition to the ſuperior ones of gratitude, juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and humanity. The man is entitled to all theſe, who prefers you to the reſt of your ſex, and perhaps whoſe greateſt weakneſs is this very preference.
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:024452_0110_0FC73DCF43041070"/>
The truth of the matter is, vanity, and the love of admiration, is ſo prevailing a paſſion among you, that you may be conſidered to make a very great ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice whenever you give up a lover, till every art of coquetry fails to keep him, or till he forces you to an explanation. You can be fond of the love, when you are indifferent to, or even when you deſpiſe the lover.</p>
               <p>But the deepeſt and moſt artful coquetry is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by women of ſuperior taſte and ſenſe, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage and fix the heart of a man whom the world and whom they themſelves eſteem, although they are firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly determined never to marry him. But his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation amuſes them, and his attachment is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt gratification to their vanity: nay, they can ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be gratified with the utter ruin of his fortune, fame, and happineſs. God forbid I ſhould ever think ſo of all your ſex! I know many of them have prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, have generoſity and dignity of ſoul, that ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate them above the worthleſs vanity I have been ſpeaking of.</p>
               <p>Such a woman, I am perſuaded, may always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert a lover, if ſhe cannot give him her affections, into a warm and ſteady friend, provided he is a man of ſenſe, reſolution, and candour. If ſhe explain her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with a generous openneſs and freedom, he muſt feel the ſtroke as a man; but he will likewiſe bear it as a man: what he ſuffers, he will ſuffer in ſilence. Every ſentiment of eſteem will remain: but love, though it requires very little food, and is eaſily ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited with too much, yet it requires ſome. He will view her in the light of a married woman; and though paſſion ſubſides, yet a man of a candid and generous heart always retains a tenderneſs for a woman he has once loved, and who has uſed him well, beyond what he feels for any other of her ſex.</p>
               <p>If he has not confided his own ſecret to any body, he has an undoubted title to aſk you not to divulge it. If a woman chooſe to truſt any of her compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with her own unfortunate attachments, ſhe may, as it is her own affair alone: but if ſhe has any gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:024452_0111_0FC73DD0B7A42BD0"/>
or gratitude, ſhe will not betray a ſecret which does not belong to her.</p>
               <p>Male coquetry is much more inexcuſable than fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, as well as more pernicious; but it is rare in this country. Very few men will give themſelves the trouble to gain or retain any woman's affections, unleſs they have views on them either of an honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able or diſhonourable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ind. Men employed in the purſuits of buſineſs, ambition, or pleaſure, will not give themſelves the trouble to engage a woman's affections, merely from the vanity of conqueſt, and of triumphing over the heart of an innocent and defence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs girl. Beſides, people never value much what is entirely in their power. A man of parts, ſentiment, and addreſs, if he lay aſide all regard to truth and humanity, may engage the hearts of fifty women at the ſame time, and may likewiſe conduct his coquetry with ſo much art, as to put it out of the power of any of them to ſpecify a ſingle expreſſion that could be ſaid to be directly expreſſive of love.</p>
               <p>This ambiguity of behaviour, this art of keeping one in ſuſpenſe, is the great ſecret of coquetry in both ſexes. It is the more cruel in us, becauſe we can carry it to what length we pleaſe, and continue it as long as we pleaſe, without your being ſo much as at liberty to complain or expoſtulate; whereas we can break our chain, and force you to explain, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we become impatient of our ſituation.</p>
               <p>I have inſiſted the more particularly on this ſubject of courtſhip, becauſe it may moſt readily happen to you at that early period of life, when you can have little experience or knowledge of the world; when your paſſions are warm, and your judgments not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at ſuch full maturity as to be able to correct them. I wiſh you to poſſeſs ſuch high principles of honour and generoſity, as will render you incapable of deceiving, and at the ſame time to poſſeſs that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>A woman in this country, may eaſily prevent the firſt impreſſions of love; and every motive of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence

and delicacy ſhould make her guard her heart againſt them, till ſuch time as ſhe has received the moſt convincing proofs of the attachment of a man of ſuch merit, as will juſtify a reciprocal regard. Your hearts, indeed, may be ſhut inflexibly and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manently againſt all the merit a man can poſſeſs. That may be your misfortune, but cannot be your fault. In ſuch a ſituation, you would be equally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt to yourſelf and your lover, if you gave him your hand, when your heart revolted againſt him. But miſerable will be your fate, if you allow an attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſteal on you before you are ſure of a return; or, what is infinitely worſe, where there are wanting thoſe qualities which alone can inſure happineſs in a married ſtate.</p>
               <p>I know nothing that renders a woman more deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, than her thinking it eſſential to happineſs to be married. Beſides the groſs indelicacy of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent, it is a falſe one, as thouſands of women have experienced. But if it were true, the belief that it is ſo, and the conſequent impatience to be married, is the moſt effectual way to prevent it.</p>
               <p>You muſt not think from this, that I do not wiſh you to marry; on the contrary, I am of opinion, that you may attain a ſuperior degree of happineſs in a married ſtate, to what you can poſſibly find in any other. I know the forlorn and unprotected ſituation of an old maid, the chagrin and peeviſhneſs which are apt to infect their tempers, and the great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of making a tranſition, with dignity and cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, from the period of youth, beauty, admiration, and reſpect, into the calm, ſilent, unnoticed retreat of declining years.</p>
               <p>I ſee ſome unmarried women, of active, vigorous minds, and great vivacity of ſpirits, degrading them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; ſometimes by entering into a diſſipated courſe of life, unſuitable to their years, and expoſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the ridicule of girls, who might have been their grand-children; ſometimes by oppreſſing their acquaintances by impertinent intruſions into their private affairs; and ſometimes by being the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gators
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:024452_0113_0FC73DDB20BB6500"/>
of ſcandal and defamation. All this is owing to an exuberant activity of ſpirit, which, if it had found employment at home, would have rendered them reſpectable and uſeful members of ſociety.</p>
               <p>I ſee other women, in the ſame ſituation, gentle, modeſt, bleſſed with ſenſe, taſte, delicacy, and every milder feminine virtue of the heart, but of weak ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, baſhful, and timid; I ſee ſuch women ſinking into obſcurity and inſignificance, and gradually loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every elegant accompliſhment; for this evident reaſon, that they are not united to a partner who has ſenſe, and worth, and taſte, to know their value; one who is able to draw forth their concealed quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and ſhow them to advantage; who can give that ſupport to their feeble ſpirits, which they ſtand ſo much in need of; and who, by his affection and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, might make ſuch a woman happy, in exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every talent, and accompliſhing herſelf in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry elegant art that could contribute to his amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, I am of opinion, that a married ſtate, if entered into from proper motives of eſteem and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will be the happieſt for yourſelves, make you moſt reſpectable in the eyes of the world, and the moſt uſeful members of ſociety: but I confeſs I am not enough of a patriot, to wiſh you to marry for the good of the public;—I wiſh you to marry for no other reaſon but to make yourſelves happier. When I am ſo particular in my advices about your conduct, I own my heart beats with the fond hopes of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you worthy the attachment of men who will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve you, and be ſenſible of your merit. But hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven forbid you ſhould ever relinquiſh the eaſe and independence of a ſingle life, to become the ſlaves of a fool or a tyrant's caprice.</p>
               <p>As theſe have always been my ſentiments, I ſhall do you but juſtice, when I leave you in ſuch inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent circumſtances, as may lay you under no temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to do from neceſſity what you would never do from choice. This will likewiſe ſave you from that cruel mortification to a woman of ſpirit, the ſuſpicion
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:024452_0114_0FC73DDCCA2C0100"/>
that a gentleman thinks he does you an honour or a favour, when he aſks you for his wife.</p>
               <p>If I live till you arrive at that age when you ſhall be capable to judge for yourſelves, and do not ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alter my ſentiments, I ſhall act towards you in a very different manner from what moſt parents do. My opinion has always been, that when that period arrives, the parental authority ceaſes.</p>
               <p>I hope I ſhall always treat you with that affection and eaſy confidence which may diſpoſe you to look on me as your friend; in that capacity alone I ſhall think myſelf entitled to give you my opinion; in the doing of which, I ſhould think myſelf highly crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, if I did not, to the utmoſt of my power, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to diveſt myſelf of all perſonal vanity, and all prejudices in favour of my particular taſte. If you did not chooſe to follow my advice, I ſhould not, on that account, ceaſe to love you as my children: though my right to your obedience was expired, yet I ſhould think nothing could releaſe me from the ties of nature and humanity.</p>
               <p>You may, perhaps, imagine, that the reſerved beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour which I recommend to you, and your appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeldom at public places, muſt cut off all opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of your being acquainted with gentlemen; I am very far from intending this. I adviſe you to no reſerve, but what will render you more reſpected and beloved by our ſex. I do not think public places ſuited to make people acquainted together: they can only be diſtinguiſhed there by their looks and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal behaviour; but it is in private companies alone, where you can expect eaſy and agreeable converſation, which I ſhould never wiſh you to decline. If you do not allow gentlemen to become acquainted with you, you can never expect to marry with attachment on either ſide. Love is very ſeldom produced at firſt ſight, at leaſt it muſt have, in that caſe, a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtifiable foundation. True love is founded on eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem, in a correſpondence of taſtes and ſentiments, and ſteals on the heart imperceptibly.</p>
               <p>There is one advice I ſhall leave you, to which I
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:024452_0115_0FC73DDE447B7600"/>
beg your particular attention:—Before your affections come to be in the leaſt engaged to any man, examine your tempers, your taſtes, and your hearts, very ſeverely, and ſettle in your own minds, what are the requiſites to your happineſs in a married ſtate; and, as it is almoſt impoſſible that you ſhould get every thing you wiſh, come to a ſteady determination what you are to conſider as eſſential, and what may be ſacrificed.</p>
               <p>If you have hearts diſpoſed by nature for love and friendſhip, and poſſeſs thoſe feelings which enable you to enter into all the refinements and delicacies of theſe attachments, conſider well, for heaven's ſake, and as you value your future happineſs, before you give them any indulgence. If you have the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune (for a very great misfortune it commonly is to your ſex) to have ſuch a temper and ſuch ſentiments deeply rooted in you, if you have ſpirit and reſolution to reſiſt the ſolicitations of vanity, the perſecution of friends (for you will have loſt the only friend that would never perſecute you,) and can ſupport the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of the many inconveniences attending the ſtate of an old maid, which I formerly pointed out, then you may indulge yourſelves in that kind of ſentimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal reading and converſation which is moſt correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to your feelings.</p>
               <p>But if you find, on a ſtrict ſelf-examination, that marriage is abſolutely eſſential to your happineſs, keep the ſecret inviolable in your own boſoms, for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons I formerly mentioned: but ſhun, as you would do the moſt fatal poiſon, all that ſpecies of read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and converſation which warms the imagination, which engages and ſoftens the heart, and raiſes the taſte above the level of common life: if you do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, conſider the terrible conflict of paſſions this may afterwards raiſe in your breaſts.</p>
               <p>If this refinement once takes deep root in your minds, and you do not obey its dictates, but marry from vulgar and mercenary views, you may never be able to eradicate it entirely, and then it will embit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all your married days. Inſtead of meeting with
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:024452_0116_0FC73DE007309F38"/>
ſenſe, delicacy, tenderneſs, a lover, a friend, an equal companion, in a huſband, you may be tired with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipidity and dulneſs; ſhocked with indelicacy, or mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by indifference. You will find none to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate, or even underſtand your ſufferings; for your huſbands may not uſe you cruelly, and may give you as much money for your clothes, perſonal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe, and domeſtic neceſſaries, as is ſuitable to their fortunes. The world would therefore look on you as unreaſonable women, and that did not deſerve to be happy, if you were not ſo. To avoid theſe complicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed evils, if you are determined at all events to marry, I would adviſe you to make all your reading and amuſements of ſuch a kind, as do not affect the heart nor the imagination, except in the way of wit or humour.</p>
               <p>I have no view by theſe advices to lead your taſtes; I only want to perſuade you of the neceſſity of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your own minds, which, though ſeemingly very eaſy, is what your ſex ſeldom attain on many impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant occaſions in life, but particularly on this of which I am ſpeaking. There is not a quality I more anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly wiſh you to poſſeſs, than that collected, deciſive ſpirit, which reſts on itſelf, which enables you to ſee where your true happineſs lies, and to purſue it with the moſt determined reſolution. In matters of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, follow the advice of thoſe who know them bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than yourſelves, and in whoſe integrity you can confide: but in matters of taſte, that depend on your own feeling, conſult no one friend whatever, but conſult your own hearts.</p>
               <p>If a gentleman makes his addreſſes to you, or gives you reaſon to believe he will do ſo, before you allow your affections to be engaged, endeavo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r, in the moſt prudent and ſecret manner, to procure from your friends every neceſſary piece of information concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him; ſuch as his character for ſenſe, his morals, his temper, fortune<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and family; whether it is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed for parts and worth, or for folly, knave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and loathſome hereditary diſeaſes. When your friends inform you of theſe, they have fulfilled their
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:024452_0117_0FC73DE7DDC8B5C8"/>
duty. If they go farther, they have not that defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence for you, which a becoming dignity on your part would effectually command.</p>
               <p>Whatever your views are in marrying, take every poſſible precaution to prevent their being diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. If fortune and the pleaſures it brings, are your aim, it is not ſufficient that the ſettlements of a join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and children's proviſions be ample, and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſecured; it is neceſſary that you ſhould enjoy the fortune during your own life. The principal ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty you can have for this, will depend on your marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a good-natured, generous man, who deſpiſes mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and who will let you live where you can beſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy that pleaſure, that pomp and parade of life, for which you married him.</p>
               <p>From what I have ſaid, you will eaſily ſee that I could never pretend to adviſe whom you ſhould mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but I can with great confidence adviſe whom you ſhould not marry.</p>
               <p>Avoid a companion that may entail any hereditary diſeaſe on your poſterity, particularly (that moſt dreadful of all human calamities) madneſs. It is the height of imprudence to run into ſuch a danger, and, in my opinion, highly criminal.</p>
               <p>Do not marry a fool; he is the moſt intractable of all animals; he is led by his paſſions and caprices, and is incapable of hearing the voice of reaſon. It may probably, too, hurt your vanity to have huſbands for whom you have reaſon to bluſh and tremble every time they open their lips in company. But the worſt circumſtance that attends a fool, is his conſtant jeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſy of his wife being thought to govern him. This renders it impoſſible to lead him; and he is continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally doing abſurd and diſagreeable things, for no other reaſon but to ſhow he dares do them.</p>
               <p>A rake is always a ſuſpicious huſband, becauſe he has only known the moſt worthleſs of your ſex. He likewiſe entails the worſt diſeaſes on his wife and children, if he has the misfortune to have any.</p>
               <p>If you have a ſenſe of religion yourſelves, do not think of huſbands who have none. If they have toler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:024452_0118_0FC73DEB251BADF8"/>
underſtandings, they will be glad that you have religion, for their own ſakes, and for the ſake of their families; but it will ſink you in their eſteem. If they are weak men, they will be continually teaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſhocking you about your principles.—If you have children, you will ſuffer the moſt bitter diſtreſs, in ſeeing all your endeavours to form their minds to virtue and piety, all your endeavours to ſecure their preſent and eternal happineſs, fruſtrated and turned into ridicule.</p>
               <p>As I look on your choice of a huſband to be of the greateſt conſequence to your happineſs, I hope you will make it with the utmoſt circumſpection. Do not give way to a ſudden ſally of paſſion, and dignify it with the name of love.—Genuine love is not founded in caprice; it is founded in nature, on honourable views, on virtue, on ſimilarity of taſtes and ſympathy of ſouls.</p>
               <p>If <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ou have theſe ſentiments, you will never marry any one, when you are not in that ſituation, in point of fortune, which is neceſſary to the happineſs of either of you. What that competency may be, can only be determined by your own taſtes. It would be ungenerous in you to take advantage of a lover's attachment, to plunge him into diſtreſs; and if he has any honour, no perſonal gratification will ever tempt him to enter into any connexion which will render you unhappy. If you have as much between you, as to ſatisfy all your demands, it is ſufficient.</p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude with endeavouring to remove a difficulty which muſt naturally occur to any woman of reflexion on the ſubject of marriage. What is to become of all thoſe refinements of delicacy, that dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of manners, which checked all familiarities, and ſuſpended deſire in reſpectful and awful admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? In anſwer to this, I ſhall only obſerve, that if motives of intereſt or vanity have had any ſhare in your reſolutions to marry, none of theſe chimerical notions will give you any pain: nay, they will very quickly appear as ridiculous in your own eyes, as they probably always did in the eyes of your huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands.
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:024452_0119_0FC73DEC767ED9F8"/>
They have been ſentiments which have float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in your imagination, but have never reached your hearts. But if theſe ſentiments have been truly ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine, and if you have had the ſingular happy fate to attach thoſe who underſtand them, you have no reaſon to be afraid.</p>
               <p>Marriage, indeed, will at once diſpel the enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment raiſed by external beauty; but the virtues and graces that firſt warmed the heart, that reſerve and delicacy which always left the lover ſomething fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to wiſh, and often made him doubtful of your ſenſibility or attachment, may and ought ever to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main. The tumult of paſſion will neceſſarily ſubſide: but it will be ſucceeded by endearment, that affects the heart in a more equal, more ſenſible, and tender manner. But I muſt check myſelf, and not indulge in deſcriptions, that may miſlead you, and that too ſenſibly awake the remembrance of my happier days, which, perhaps, it were better for me to forget for ever.</p>
               <p>I have thus given you my opinion on ſome of the moſt important articles of your future life, chiefly calculated for that period when you are juſt entering the world. I have endeavoured to avoid ſome pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarities of opinion, which, from their contradiction to the general practice of the world, I might reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably have ſuſpected were not ſo well founded. But, in writing to you, I am afraid my heart has been too full, and too warmly intereſted, to allow me to keep this reſolution. This may have produced ſome em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſments and ſome ſeeming contradictions. What I have written has been the amuſement of ſome ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary hours, and has ſerved to divert ſome melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly reflexions.—I am conſcious I undertook a taſk to which I was very unequal; but I have diſcharged a part of my duty.—You will, at leaſt, be pleaſed with it, as the laſt mark of your father's love and attention.</p>

            <p>WAS there any probability that a letter from me would be permitted to reach <hi>your hand alone,</hi> I ſhould not have choſen this leaſt eligible method of writing to you. The public is no way concerned in family affairs, and ought not to be made a party in them; but my circumſtances are ſuch, as lay me under the neceſſity of either communicating my ſentiments to the world, or of concealing them <hi>from you:</hi> the latter would, I think, be the breach of an indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble duty, which obliges me to waive the impropriety of the former.</p>
            <p>A long train of events, of a moſt extraordinary na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, conſpired to remove you very early from the tender care of an affectionate mother. You were too young to be able to form any right judgment of her conduct; and ſince that time it is very probable that it has been repreſented to you in a moſt unfavourable light. The general prejudice againſt me I never gave myſelf the uſeleſs trouble of any endeavour to remove. I do not mean to infer from hence, that the opinion of
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:024452_0121_0FC73DEF753F4578"/>
others is of no material conſequence; on the contrary, I would adviſe you always to remember, that, next to the conſciouſneſs of acting right, the public voice ſhould be regarded; and to endeavour by a prudent behaviour, even in the moſt trifling inſtances, to ſecure it in your favour. The being educated in a different opinion, was a misfortune to <hi>me.</hi> I was indeed early and wiſely taught, that virtue was the one thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and that without it no happineſs could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected either in this, or in any future ſtat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of exiſtence; but, with this good principle, a miſtaken one was at the ſame time inculcated, namely, that the ſelf-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation ariſing from conſcious virtue was alone ſufficient; and, that the cenſures of an ill-natured world, ever ready to calumniate, when not founded on truth, were beneath the concern of a perſon whoſe actions were guided by the ſuperior motive of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the will of heaven.</p>
            <p>This notion, ſtrongly imbibed before reaſon had gained ſufficient ſtrength to diſcover its fallacy, was the cauſe of an inconſiderate conduct in my ſubſequent life, which marked my character with a diſadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous impreſſion. To you I ſhall ſpeak with the moſt unreſerved ſincerity, not concealing a fault which you may profit by the knowledge of; and therefore I freely own, that in my younger years, ſatisfied with keeping ſtrictly within the bounds of virtue, I took a fooliſh pleaſure in exceeding thoſe of prudence, and was ridiculouſly vain of indulging a latitude of beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, into which others of my age were afraid of launching: but then, in juſtice to myſelf, I muſt at the ſame time declare, that this freedom was only taken in public company; and ſo extremely cautious was I of doing any thing which appeared to me a juſt ground for cenſure, that I call heaven to witneſs, your father was the firſt man whom I ever made any private aſſignation with, or even met in a room a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; nor did I tak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> that liberty with him till the moſt ſolemn mutual engagement, the matrimonial ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, had bound us to each other. My behaviour, then, he has frequently ſince acknowledged, fully
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:024452_0122_0FC73DF81AD67008"/>
convinced him I was not only innocent of any crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal act, but of every vicious thought; and that the outward freedom of my deportment, which proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed merely from a great gaiety of temper, and from a very high flow of ſpirits, never broke (if the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion may be allowed) into the formal rules of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum. To ſum up the whole in a few words, my private conduct was what the ſevereſt prude could not condemn; my public, ſuch as the moſt finiſhed coquet alone would have ventured upon: the latter only could be known to the world, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, from thence muſt their opinion be taken. You will therefore eaſily be ſenſible, that it would not be favourable to me; on the contrary, it gave a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral prejudice againſt me: and this has been ſince made uſe of as an argument to gain credit to the malicious falſehoods laid to my charge. For this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, convinced by long experience that the greater part of mankind are ſo apt to receive, and ſo wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to retain a bad impreſſion of others, that, when it is once eſtabliſhed, there is hardly a poſſibility of removing it through life; I have, for ſome years paſt, ſilently acquieſced in the diſpenſations of providence, without attempting any juſtification of myſelf; and, being conſcious that the infamous aſperſions caſt on my character were not founded on truth, I have ſat down content with the certainty of an open and perfect acquittal of all vicious diſpoſitions, or crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal conduct, at that great day, when all things ſhall appear as they really are, and when both our actions, and the moſt ſecret motives for them, will be made manifeſt to men and angels.</p>
            <p>Had your father been among the number of thoſe who were deceived by appearances, I ſhould have thought it my duty to leave no method uneſſayed to clear myſelf in his opinion; but that was not the caſe.

to obey; and that others, even ſince our ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, were occaſioned by ſome particular inſtances of his behaviour, which rendered it impoſſible for me to act with ſafety in any other manner. To <hi>him</hi> I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal for the truth of this aſſertion, who is conſcious of the meaning that may hereafter be explained to you. Perfectly acquainted with my principles and with my natural diſpoſition, his heart, I am convinced, never here condemned me. Being greatly incenſed that my father's will gave to me an independent fortune; which will, he imagined, I was acceſſary to, or at leaſt that I could have prevented; he was thereby laid open to the arts of deſigning men, who, having their own intereſt ſolely in view, worked him up into a deſire of revenge, and from thence, upon probable circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, into a public accuſation: though that public accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation was ſupported only by the ſingle teſtimony of a perſon, whoſe known falſehood had made him a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times declare that he would not credit her oath in the moſt trifling incident; yet, when he was diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of the additional evidence he might have been flattered with the hope of obtaining, it was too late to recede. This I ſincerely believe to be the truth of the caſe, though I too well know his <hi>tenacious</hi> temper, to expect a preſent juſtification; but, whenever he ſhall arrive on the verge of eternity, if Reaſon holds her place at the awful moment, and if religion has then any power on his heart, I make no doubt, he will at that time acquit me to his children; and with truth he muſt then confeſs, that no part of my behaviour to him ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the treatment I have met with.</p>
            <p>Sorry am I to be under the neceſſity of pointing out faults in the conduct of another, which are, perhaps, long ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ce repented of, and ought in that caſe to be as much forgotten as they are moſt truly forgiven. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven knows, that, ſo far from retaining any degree of reſentment in my heart, the perſon breathes not, whom I wiſh to hurt, or to whom I would not this moment render every ſervice in my power. The injuries which I have ſuſtained, had I no children, ſhould contentedly be buried in ſilence till the great day of retribution;
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:024452_0124_0FC73DFAB7360C68"/>
but, in juſtice to you, to them, and myſelf, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on me, as far as poſſible, to efface the falſe impreſſions, which by ſuch ſilence, might be fixed on your mind, and on thoſe of your brothers and ſiſters, whom I include with you. To this end, it will be neceſſary to enter into a circumſtantial hiſtory of near fifteen years, full of incidents of a nature ſo uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon as ſcarcely to be credible. This, I am convinced, will effectually clear me, in your opinion, of the imputations I now lie under; and it will prove, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to a demonſtration, the true cauſe of thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings againſt me that were couched under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended motives, as injurious to my reputation as they were falſe in themſelves.</p>
            <p>But this muſt be deferred ſome time longer. You are all yet too young to enter into things of this kind, or to judge properly of them. When a few years ſhall, by ripening your underſtandings, remove this objection, you ſhall be informed of the whole truth, moſt impartially and without diſguiſe. 'Till then ſuſpend your belief of all that may have reached your ears with regard to me, and wait the knowledge of thoſe facts, which my future letters will reveal for your information.</p>
            <p>Thus much I thought it neceſſary to premiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning myſelf, though foreign to the deſign of <hi>this epiſtle,</hi> which is only to remind you that you have ſtill an affectionate mother, who is anxious for your welfare, and deſirous of giving you ſome advice with regard to your conduct in life. I would lay down a few precepts for you, which, if attended to, will ſupply as far as it is in my power to ſupply, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation of a conſtant and tender maternal care. The addreſs is <hi>to you</hi> in particular, your ſiſters being yet too young to receive it; but my intention is for the equal ſervice of you all.</p>
            <p>You are juſt entering, my dear girl, into a world full of deceit and falſehood, where few perſons or things appear in their true character. Vice hides her deformity with the borrowed garb of virtue; and, though diſcernible to an intelligent and careful ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver,
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:024452_0125_0FC73DFC58A0FE20"/>
by the unbecoming awkwardneſs of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment under it, ſhe paſſes on thouſands undetected. Every preſent pleaſure uſurps the name of happineſs, and as ſuch deceives the unwary purſuer. Thus one general maſk diſguiſes the whole face of things; and it requires a long experience, and a penetrating judgment, to diſcover the truth. Thrice happy they, whoſe docile tempers improve from the inſtructions of maturer age, and who thereby attain ſome degree of this neceſſary knowledge, while it may be uſeful in directing their conduct!</p>
            <p>The turn which your mind may now take, will fix the happineſs or miſery of your future life; and I am too nearly concerned for your welfare, not to be moſt ſolicitouſly anxious that you may be early led into ſo juſt a way of thinking, as will be productive to you of a prudent, rational behaviour, and which will ſecure to you a laſting felicity. You were old enough before our ſeparation, to convince me that heaven has not denied you a good natural under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. This, if properly cultivated, will ſet you above that trifling diſpoſition, too common among the female world, which makes youth ridiculous, maturity inſignificant, and old age contemptible. It is therefore needleſs to enlarge on that head, ſince good ſenſe is there the beſt adviſer; and, without it, all admonitions or directions on the ſubject would be as fruitleſs as to lay down rules for the conduct or for the actions of an ideot.</p>
            <p>There is no room to doubt but that ſufficient care will be taken to give you a polite education; but a religious one is ſtill of greater conſequence. Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary as the former is for your making a proper figure in the world, and for your being well accepted in it, the latter is yet more ſo, to ſecure to you the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the greateſt and beſt of Beings; on whoſe favour depends your everlaſting happineſs. Let there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your duty to GOD be ever the firſt and principal object of your care. As your Creator and Governor, he claims adoration and obedience; as your Father and Friend, he demands ſubmiſſive duty and affection.
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:024452_0126_0FC73E042FCCE488"/>
Remember that from this common parent of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe you received your life; that to his general pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence you owe the continuance of it; and to his bounty you are indebted for all the health, eaſe, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, or enjoyments, which help to make that life agreeable. A ſenſe of benefits received natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſpires a grateful diſpoſition, with a deſire of making ſuitable returns. All that can here be made, for innumerable favours every moment beſtowed, is a thankful acknowledgment, and a willing obedience. In theſe be never wanting. Make it an invariable rule to begin and end the day with a ſolemn addreſs to the Deity. I mean not by this, what is commonly, with too much propriety, called <hi>ſaying of prayers,</hi> namely, a cuſtomary repetition of a few good words, without either devotion or attention; than which nothing is more inexcuſable and affrontive to the Deity; it is the homage of the heart that can alone be accepted by him. Expreſſions of our abſolute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence on, and of our entire reſignation to him— thankſgivings for the mercies already received—peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for thoſe bleſſings it is fit for us to pray for—and interceſſions for all our fellow creatures, compoſe the principal parts of this duty; which may be compriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a very few words, or may be more enlarged upon, as the circumſtances of time and diſpoſition may render moſt ſuitable; for it is not the length, but the ſincerity and attention of our prayers that will make them efficacious. A good heart, joined to a tolerable underſtanding, will ſeldom be at a loſs for proper words with which to clothe theſe ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: and all perſons being beſt acquainted with their own particular circumſtances, may reaſonably be ſuppoſed beſt qualified for adapting their petitions and acknowledgments to them; but for thoſe who are of a different opinion, there are many excellent forms of prayer already compoſed. Among theſe, none that I know of, are equal to doctor Hoadley's, the late biſhop of Wincheſter, which I recommend to your peruſal and uſe. In the preface to them, you
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:024452_0127_0FC73E078E515C08"/>
will find better inſtructions on this head, than I am capable of giving; and to theſe I refer you.</p>
            <p>It is acknowledged that our petitions cannot in any degree alter the intention of a being, who is in himſelf invariable, and without a poſſibility of change: all that can be expected from them is, that, by bettering ourſelves, they will render us more proper objects of his favourable regard: and this muſt neceſſarily be the reſult of a ſerious, regular, and conſtant diſcharge of this branch of our duty; for it is ſcarcely poſſible to offer up our ſincere and fervent devotions to heaven every morning and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, without leaving on our minds ſuch uſeful im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions as will naturally diſpoſe us to a ready and cheerful obedience, and will inſpire a filial fear of offending, the beſt ſecurity virtue can have. As you value your own happineſs, let not the force of bad examples ever lead you into an habitual diſuſe of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret prayer; nor let an unpardonable negligence ſo far prevail on you, as to make you reſt ſatisfied with a formal, cuſtomary, inattentive repetition of ſome w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>l-choſen words: let your heart and attention al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways go with your lips; and experience will ſoon convince you, that this permiſſion of addreſſing the ſupreme being is the moſt valuable prerogative of human nature; the chief, nay the only ſupport under all the diſtreſſes and calamities to which this ſtate of ſin and miſery is liable; the higheſt rational ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction the mind is capable of on this ſide the grave; and the beſt preparative for everlaſting happineſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it. This is a duty ever in your own power; and therefore you only will be culpable by the omiſſion of it.</p>
            <p>Public worſhip may not always be ſo: but when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is, do not wilfully neglect the ſervice of the church, at leaſt on Sundays; and let your behaviour there be adapted to the ſolemnity of the place, and to the intention of the meeting. Regard neither the actions nor the dreſs of others: let not your eyes rove in ſearch of acquaintance; but in the time of divine ſervice avoid, as much as poſſible, all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plimental
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:024452_0128_0FC73E08F6D9EA78"/>
civilities, of which there is too great an intercourſe, in moſt of our churches. Remember that your only buſineſs there is to pay a ſolemn act of devotion to Almighty God, and let every part of your conduct be ſuitable to this great end. If you hear a good ſermon, treaſure it in your memory, that you may reap all the benefit it was capable of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting; if you ſhould hear but an indifferent one, ſome good things muſt be in it; retain thoſe, and let the remainder be buried in oblivion. Ridicule not the preacher, who, no doubt, has done his beſt, and who is rather the object of pity than of contempt, for having been placed in a ſituation of life, to which his talents were not equal: he may perhaps be a good man, though he is not a great orator.</p>
            <p>I would alſo recommend to you the early and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent participation of the communion, or what is commonly called receiving the ſacrament, as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſible duty of every chriſtian. There is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of our religion more ſimple, plain, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible than this, as delivered to us by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our: and moſt of the elaborate treatiſes written on the ſubject have ſerved only to puzzle and to diſturb weak minds, by throwing the dark veil of ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and of human invention over a plain, poſitive command, given by him in ſo explicit a manner as to be eaſily comprehended by the meaneſt capacity, and which is doubtleſs in the power of all his ſincere followers to pay an acceptable obedience to. Nothing has more contributed to the neglect of this duty, than the numerous well-meaning books that have been written to enjoin a month's or a week's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, as previouſly neceſſary to the due perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it: by theſe means filling the minds of many with needleſs terror, putting it even out of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of ſome to receive it at all, and inducing great numbers to reſt ſatisfied with doing it only once or twice a year, on ſome high feſtival; whereas it was certainly the conſtant cuſtom of the apoſties and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive chriſtians on every Sunday; and it ought to be received by us as often as it is adminiſtered in the
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:024452_0129_0FC73E0B9E4E6858"/>
church we frequent, which in moſt places is but once in a month. Nor do I think it excuſable, at any time, to turn our backs upon the table we ſee prepared for that purpoſe, on pretence of not being fit to partake worthily of it. The beſt, the only true preparation for this, and for every other part of religious duty, is a good and virtuous life, by which the mind is conſtantly kept in ſuch a devotional frame, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire but a little recollection to be ſuited to any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular act of worſhip or of obedience that may oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally offer: and without a good and virtuous life, there cannot be a greater or more fatal miſtake than to ſuppoſe that a few days or weeks ſpent in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation and prayer will render us at all the more acceptable to the Deity, or that we ſhould be thereby better fitted for any one inſtance of that duty which we muſt univerſally pay, to be either approved by him, or to be advantageous to ourſelves: I would not therefore adviſe you to read any of thoſe weekly preparatives, which are too apt to lead the mind into error, by teaching it to reſt in a mere ſhadow of piety, wherein there is nothing rationally ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory. The beſt books which I have ever met with on this ſubject, are biſhop Hoadly's <hi>Plain account of the nature and end of the ſacrament of the Lord's ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> and Nelſon's <hi>Great duty of frequenting the chriſtian ſacrifice.</hi> To the former are annexed the prayers which I before mentioned: theſe are well worth your attentive peruſal: the deſign of the inſtitution is therein fully explained, agreeable both to ſcripture and to reaſon; ſtript of that veil of myſtery which has been induſtriouſly thrown over it by deſigning or by miſtaken men; and it is there laid as plainly open to every capacity, as it was at firſt left us by our great maſter. Read <hi>theſe books</hi> with due attention: you will there find every neceſſary inſtruction con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the right, and every reaſonable inducement to the conſtant and to the conſcientious performance of it.</p>
            <p>The ſincere practice of religious duties naturally leads to the proper diſcharge of the ſocial, which
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:024452_0130_0FC73E0CBAA99BD0"/>
may be all comprehended in that one great general rule of <hi>doing unto others as you would they ſhould do unto you;</hi> but of theſe more particularly hereafter. —I ſhall firſt give you my advice concerning <hi>employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> it being of great moment to ſet out in life in ſuch a method as may be uſeful to yourſelf and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial to others.</p>
            <p>Time is invaluable; its loſs is irretrievable! The remembrance of having made an ill uſe of it muſt be one of the ſharpeſt tortures to thoſe who are on the brink of eternity! and what can yield a more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing retroſpect, than whole years idled away in an irrational, inſignificant manner, examples of which are continually before our eyes! Look on every day as a blank ſheet of paper put into your hands to be filled up: remember the characters will remain to endleſs ages, and that they never can be expunged; be careful therefore not to write any thing but what you may read with pleaſure a thouſand years after. I would not be underſtood in a ſenſe ſo ſtrict as might debar you from any innocent amuſement, ſuitable to your age, and agreeable to your inclination. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions, properly regulated, are not only allowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they are abſolutely neceſſary to youth, and are never criminal, but when taken to exceſs; that is, when they engroſs the whole thought, when they are made the chief buſineſs of life: they then give a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſte to every valuable employment, and by a ſort of infatuation, leave the mind in a ſtate of reſtleſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience from the concluſion of one 'till the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of another. This is the unfortunate diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of many. Guard moſt carefully againſt it, for nothing can be attended with more pernicious conſequences. A little obſervation will convince you that there is not, among the human ſpecies, a ſet of more miſerable beings, than thoſe who cannot live out of a conſtant ſucceſſion of diverſions. Theſe people have no comprehenſion of the more ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory pleaſure to be found in retirement: thought is inſupportable, and conſequently ſolitude muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable to them; they are a burden to themſelves,
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:024452_0131_0FC73E108159B400"/>
and a peſt to their acquaintance, by vainly ſeeking for happineſs in company, where they are ſeldom ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable: I ſay vainly, for true happineſs exiſts only in the mind; nothing foreign can give it. The ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to be attained by what is called a gay life, is a ſhort forgetfulneſs of miſery, to be felt with accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated anguiſh in every interval of reflexion. This reſtleſs temper is frequently the product of a too eager purſuit of pleaſure in the early part of life, to the neglect of thoſe valuable improvements which would lay the foundation of a more ſolid and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent felicity. Youth is the ſeaſon for diverſions; but it is alſo the ſeaſon for acquiring knowledge, for fixing uſeful habits, and for laying in a ſtock of ſuch well-choſen materials, as may grow into a ſerene happineſs, which will increaſe with every added year of life, and will bloom in the fulleſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in the decline of it. The great art of edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation conſiſts in aſſigning to each its proper place, in ſuch a manner that the one ſhall never become irkſome by intrenching on the other.—Our ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion having taken from me the pleaſing taſk of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring, to the beſt of my ability, to ſuit them occaſionally, as might be moſt conducive both to your profit and pleaſure, it only remains for me to give you general rules, which, indeed, accidents may make it neceſſary ſometimes to vary; thoſe however muſt be left to your own diſcretion; and I am convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you have a ſufficient ſhare of underſtanding to be very capable of making advantageouſly ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual regulations for yourſelf, if the inclination is not wanting.</p>
            <p>It is an excellent method to appropriate the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholly to improvement; the afternoon may then be allowed to diverſions. Under this laſt head, I place company, books of the amuſing kind, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining productions of the needle, as well as plays, balls, cards, &amp;c. which more commonly go by the name of diverſions: the afternoon, and evening till ſupper, may by theſe be employed with innocence and propriety; but let not one of them ever be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:024452_0132_0FC73E11F62A8BF0"/>
to intrude on the former part of the day, which ſhould be always devoted to more uſeful employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. One half hour, or more, either before or immediately after breakfaſt, I would have you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly give to the attentive peruſal of ſome rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pious author, or to ſome part of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with which, and indeed with the whole ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, you ought to make yourſelf perfectly acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as the baſis on which your religion is founded. From this practice you will reap more real benefit, than can be ſuppoſed by thoſe who have never made the experiment. The other hours may be divided among thoſe neceſſary and polite acquiſitions which are ſuitable to your ſex, age, and to your rank in life.—Study <hi>your own language</hi> thoroughly, that you may ſpeak correctly, and write grammatically: do not content yourſelf with the common uſe of words, which cuſtom has taught you from the cradle, but learn from whence they are derived, and what are their proper ſignifications.—<hi>French</hi> you ought to be as well acquainted with as with <hi>Engliſh:</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> might, without much difficulty, be added.—Acquire a good knowledge of hiſtory; that of your own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try firſt, then of the other European nations; read them not with a view to amuſe, but to improve your mind; and to that end make reflexions on what you have read, which may be uſeful to yourſelf, and will render your converſation agreeable to others.— Learn ſo much of <hi>geography</hi> as to form a juſt idea of the ſituation of places, mentioned in any au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor: and this will make hiſtory more entertaining to you.</p>
            <p>It is neceſſary for you to be perfect in <hi>the firſt four rules of arithmetic:</hi> more you can never have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for, and the mind ſhould not be burdened with needleſs application.—<hi>Muſic</hi> and <hi>drawing</hi> are accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments well worth the trouble of attaining, if your inclination and genius lead to either: if not, do not attempt them; for it will be only much time and great labour unprofitably thrown away; it being next to impoſſible to arrive at any degree of perfection in
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:024452_0133_0FC73E1AB1B74798"/>
thoſe arts, by the dint of perſeverance only, if a good ear and a native genius be wanting.—The ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of <hi>natural philoſophy</hi> you will find both pleaſing and inſtructive; pleaſing, from the continual new diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries to be made of the innumerably various beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of nature, a moſt agreeable gratification of that deſire of knowledge wiſely implanted in the human mind; and highly inſtructive, as thoſe diſcoveries lead to the contemplation of the great Author of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whoſe wiſdom and goodneſs ſo conſpicuouſly ſhine through all his works, that it is impoſſible to reflect ſeriouſly on them, without admiration and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</p>
            <p>Theſe, my dear, are but a few of thoſe mental im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements I would recommend to you. Indeed there is no branch of knowledge that your capacity is equal to, and which you have an opportunity of acquiring, that, I think, ought to be neglected. It has been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected againſt all female learning, beyond that of houſehold economy, that it tends only to fill the minds of the ſex with a conceited vanity, which ſets them above their proper buſineſs; occaſions an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference to, if not a total neglect of, their family affairs; and ſerves only to render them uſeleſs wives, and impertinent companions. It muſt be confeſſed, that ſome reading ladies have given but too much cauſe for this objection; and could it be proved to hold good throughout the ſex, it would certainly be right to confine their improvements within the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row limits of the nurſery, of the kitchen, and the confectionary: but, I believe, it will, upon examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, be found, that ſuch ill conſequences proceed chiefly from too great an imbecility of mind to be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of much enlargement, or from a mere affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of knowledge, void of all reality. Vanity is never the reſult of underſtanding. A ſenſible woman will ſoon be convinced, that all the learning her ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt application can make her miſtreſs of, will be, from the difference of education, in many points, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to that of a ſchoolboy: this reflexion will keep her always humble, and will be an effectual check to
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:024452_0134_0FC73E1BB93946D8"/>
that loquacity which renders ſome women ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable companions.</p>
            <p>The management of all domeſtic affairs is certainly the proper buſineſs of woman; and, unfaſhionably ruſtic as ſuch an aſſertion may be thought, it is not beneath the dignity of any lady, however high her rank, to know <hi>how</hi> to educate her children, to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern her ſervants; how to order an elegant table with economy, and to manage her whole family with prudence, regularity, and method. If in theſe ſhe is defective, whatever may be her attainments in any other kinds of knowledge, ſhe will act out of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter; and, by not moving in her proper ſphere, ſhe will become rather the object of ridicule than of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation. But I believe it may with truth be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, that the neglect of theſe domeſtic concerns has much more frequently proceeded from an exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant love of diverſions, from a ridiculous fondneſs for dreſs and gallantry, or from a miſtaken pride, that has placed ſuch duties in a ſervile light, from whence they have been conſidered as fit only for the employment of dependants, and below the attention of a fine lady, than from too great an attachment to mental improvements: yet, from whatſoever cauſe ſuch a neglect proceeds, it is equally unjuſtifiable. If any thing can be urged in vindication of a cuſtom unknown to our anceſtors, which the prevalence of faſhion has made ſo general among the modern ladies; I mean, that of committing to the care and diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary power of different ſervants, the ſole manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of family affairs: nothing, certainly, can be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged in defence of ſuch an ignorance, in things of this nature, as renders a lady incapable of giving proper directions on all occaſions; an ignorance, which, in ever ſo exalted a ſtation, will render her contemptible, even to thoſe ſervants, on whoſe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and fidelity ſhe, in fact, becomes dependent for the regularity of her houſe, for the propriety, elegance, and frugality of her table: which laſt arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle is ſeldom regarded by ſuch ſort of people, who too frequently impoſe on thoſe by whom they are
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:024452_0135_0FC73E1E54074608"/>
thus implicitly truſted. Make yourſelf, therefore, ſo thoroughly requainted with the moſt proper method of conducting a family, and with the neceſſary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe which every article, in proportion to their number, will occaſion, that you may come to a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable certainty of not being materially deceived, without the ridiculous drudgery of following your ſervants continually, and meanly peeping into every obſcure corner of your houſe: nor is this at all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to attain, as it requires nothing more than an attentive obſervation.</p>
            <p>It is of late, in moſt great families, become too much the cuſtom, to be long upon the books of every tradeſman they employ. To aſſign a reaſon for this is foreign to my purpoſe; but I am certain it would, in general, be better both for themſelves, and for the people they deal with, never to be on them at all; and what difficulty or inconvenience can ariſe, in a well-regulated family, from commiſſioning the ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard or houſe-keeper to pay for every thing at the time when it is brought in? This obſolete practice, though in itſelf very laudable, is not at preſent, and perhaps never may be again, authoriſed by faſhion: however, let it be a rule with you to contract as few debts as poſſible: moſt things are to be purchaſed both better in their kind, and at a lower price, by paying for them at the time of purchaſing. But if, to avoid the ſuppoſed trouble of frequent trifling diſburſements, you chooſe to have the leſſer articles thrown together in a bill, let a note of the quantity and price be brought with every ſuch parcel: file theſe notes, compare them with the bill when deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in, and let ſuch bills be regularly paid every quarter: for it is not reaſonable to expect, that a tradeſman ſhould give longer credit, without making up the intereſt of his money by an advanced price on what he ſells: and be aſſured, if you find it incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to pay at the end of three months, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience muſt ariſe from living at too great an expenſe, and will conſequently increaſe in ſix months, and grow ſtill greater at the end of the year. By
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:024452_0136_0FC73E1F7A7C5DC8"/>
making ſhort payments, you will become the ſooner ſenſible of ſuch a miſtake, and you will find it at firſt more eaſy to retrench any ſupernumeraries than af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having been long habituated to them.</p>
            <p>If your houſe is ſuperintended by an houſe-keeper, and your ſervants are accountable to her, let your houſe-keeper be accountable to yourſelf, and let her be entirely governed by your directions. Carefully examine her bills, and ſuffer no extravagances or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary articles to paſs unnoticed. Let theſe bills be brought to you every morning: what they contain will then be eaſily recollected without burdening your memory; and your accounts being ſhort will be adjuſted with leſs trouble and with more exactneſs. Should you at any time have an upper ſervant, whoſe family and education were ſuperior to that ſtate of ſubjection to which ſucceeding misfortunes may have reduced her, ſhe ought to be treated with peculiar indulgence: if ſhe has underſtanding enough to be converſible, and humility enough always to keep her proper diſtance, leſſen, as much as poſſible, every painful remembrance of former proſpects, by look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on her as an humble friend, and making her an occaſional companion. But never deſcend to converſe with thoſe whoſe birth, education, and early views in life were not ſuperior to a ſtate of ſervitude; their minds being in general ſuited to their ſtation, they are apt to be intoxicated by any degree of familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to become uſeleſs and impertinent. The ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, which very many ladies have contracted, of talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to and conſulting with their women, has ſo ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that ſet of ſervants, that few of them are to be met with, who do not commence their ſervice by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their unaſked opinion of your perſon, dreſs, or management, artfully conveyed in the too generally accepted vehicle of flattery; and, if they are allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this, they will next proceed to offer their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice on any occaſion that may happen to diſcompoſe or ruffle your temper: check, therefore, the firſt appearance of ſuch impertinence, by a reprimand ſufficiently ſevere to prevent a repetition of it.</p>

               <pb n="140" facs="unknown:024452_0137_0FC73E24705F02C8"/>Give your orders in a plain, diſtinct manner, with good nature joined to a ſteadineſs that will ſhow they muſt be punctually obeyed. Treat all your domeſtics with ſuch mildneſs and affability, that you may be ſerved rather out of affection than fear. Let them live happily under you. Give them leiſure for their own buſineſs, time for innocent recreation, and more eſpecially for attending the public ſervice of the church, to be inſtructed in their duty to God; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which you have no right to expect the diſcharge of that owing to yourſelf. When wrong, tell them calmly of their faults; if they amend not after two or three ſuch rebukes, diſmiſs them: but never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to paſſion and ſcolding, which is inconſiſtent with a good underſtanding, and beneath the dignity of a gentlewoman.</p>
            <p>Be very exact in your hours, without which there can be no order in your family; I mean thoſe of riſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, eating, &amp;c.

Be always dreſt at leaſt half an hour before dinner. Having men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned this important article, I muſt be allowed a little digreſſion on the ſubject.</p>
            <p>Whatever time is taken up in dreſs, beyond what is neceſſary to decency and cleanlineſs, may be looked upon, to ſay no worſe, as a vacuum in life.

A com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with faſhion, ſo far as to avoid the affectation of ſingularity, is neceſſary: but to run into the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme of faſhions, more eſpecially thoſe which are inconvenient, is the certain proof of a weak mind. Have a better opinion of yourſelf, than to ſuppoſe you can receive any additional merit from the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious ornaments of dreſs. Leave the ſtudy of the

Look upon all beyond this as immaterial in itſelf, any further than as the different ranks of mankind have made ſome diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in habit generally eſteemed neceſſary; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that it is never the dreſs, however ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, which reflects dignity and honour on the perſon: it is the rank and merit of the perſon that give con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to the dreſs. But to return:—</p>
            <p>It is your own ſteadineſs and example of regulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that alone can preſerve uninterrupted order in your family. If, by forgetfulneſs or inattention, you at any time ſuffer your commands to be diſobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with impunity, your ſervants will grow upon ſuch neglect into a habit of careleſſneſs, till repeated faults, of which this is properly the ſource, rouſe you into anger, which an even hand would never have made neceſſary. Be not whimſical or capricious in your likings: approve with judgment, and condemn with reaſon; that acting right may be as certainly the means of obtaining your favour, as the contrary of incurring your diſpleaſure.</p>
            <p>From what has been ſaid, you will ſee, that in order to the proper diſcharge of your domeſtic du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, it is abſolutely neceſſary for you to have a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect knowledge of every branch of houſehold econo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, without which you can neither correct what is wrong, approve what is right, nor give directions with propriety. It is the want of this knowledge, that reduces many a fine lady's family to a ſtate of
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:024452_0139_0FC73E2EA38DBAF8"/>
the utmoſt confuſion and diſorder, on the ſudden re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of a managing ſervant, till the place is ſupplied by a ſucceſſor of equal ability. How much out of character, how ridiculous muſt a miſtreſs of a family appear, who is entirely incapable of giving practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal orders on ſuch an occaſion! Let that never be <hi>your</hi> caſe! Remember, my dear, this is the only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per temporal buſineſs aſſigned you by Providence, and in a thing ſo indiſpenſably needful, ſo eaſily at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, where ſo little ſtudy o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> application is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to arrive at the moſt commendable degree of it, the want even of perfection is almoſt inexcuſable. Make yourſelf miſtreſs of the theory, that you may be able the more readily to reduce it into practice; and when you have a family to command, let the care of it always employ your principal attention, and let every part of it be ſubjected to your own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection.</p>
            <p>If you riſe early, a cuſtom I hope you have not left off ſince you were with me, if you waſte no unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary time in dreſſing, and if you conduct your houſe in a regular method, you will find many vacant hours unfilled by this material buſineſs; and no objection can be made to your employing thoſe in ſuch improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the mind, as are m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt ſuitable to your ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius and inclination. I believe no man of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will think, that, under ſuch regulations, a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man will either make a leſs agreeable companion, a leſs uſeful wife, a leſs careful mother, or a worſe miſtreſs of a family, for all the additional know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge her induſtry and application can acquire.</p>
            <p>The morning being always thus advantageouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, the latter part of the day, as I before ſaid, may be given to relaxation and amuſement. Some of theſe hours may be very agreeably and uſefully employed by entertaining books; a few of which, in the Engliſh language, I will mention to you, as a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimen of the kind I would recommend to your peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal; and I ſhall include ſome others, religious and inſtructive.</p>

            <p>From theſe you may form a judgment of that ſort of reading which will be both uſeful and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to you. I have named only thoſe <hi>practical ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> which, I thought, would more directly influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence your conduct in life. <hi>Our rule of faith</hi> ſhould be taken from the ſcripture alone, which we muſt underſtand for ourſelves; therefore the controverted opinions of others ſerve, in general, rather to puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle than to improve the mind.</p>
            <p>Of <hi>novels</hi> and <hi>romances,</hi> very few are worth the trouble of reading: ſome of them, perhaps, do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a few good morals; but they are not worth the finding, where ſo much rubbiſh is intermixed. Their moral parts, indeed, are like ſmall diamonds among mountains of dirt and traſh, which, after you have found them, are too inconſiderable to anſwer the pains of coming at; yet, ridiculous as theſe fictitious tales generally are, they are ſo artfully managed as to excite an idle curioſity to ſee the concluſion, by which means the reader is drawn on, through a tire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome length of fooliſh adventures, from which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knowledge, pleaſure, or profit, can accrue, to the common cataſtrophe of a wedding. The moſt I have met with of theſe writings, to ſay no worſe, it is little better than the loſs of time to peruſe. But ſome of them have more pernicious conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. By drawing characters that never exiſt in life, by repreſenting perſons and things in a falſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant light, and by a ſeries of improbable cauſes
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:024452_0142_0FC73E32F8C5FF20"/>
bringing on impoſſible events, they are apt to give a romantic turn to the mind, which is often productive of great errors in judgment, and of fatal miſtakes in conduct. Of this I have ſeen frequent inſtances, and therefore adviſe you ſcarcely ever to meddle with any of them.</p>
            <p>In juſtice, however, to a late ingenious author, this letter muſt not be reprinted, without my acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that, ſince the laſt edition was publiſhed, I have accidentally met with one exception to my ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rule, namely, <hi>The Vicar of Wakefield.</hi> That novel is equally entertaining and inſtructive, without being liable to any of the objections that occaſioned the above reſtriction. This poſſibly may not be the only exceptionable piece of the kind; but as I have not met with any other, among a number I have peruſed, a ſingle inſtance does not alter my opinion of that ſort of writing; and I ſtill think, the chance is perhaps a thouſand to one againſt the probability of obtaining the ſmalleſt degree of advantage from the reading any of them, as well as that very few are to be found, from which much injury may not be received.</p>
            <p>Works of the needle, that employ the fancy, may, if they ſuit your inclination, be ſometimes a pretty amuſement: but let this employment never extend to large pieces, beyond what can be accompliſhed by yourſelf without aſſiſtance. There is not a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er extravagance under the ſpecious name of good houſewifery, than the furniſhing of houſes in this manner. Whole apartments have been ſeen thus ornamented by the ſuppoſed work of a lady, who, perhaps, never ſhaded two leaves in the artificial foreſt, but has paid four times its value to the ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al people employed in bringing it to perfection. The expenſe of theſe tedious pieces of work I ſpeak of experimentally, having, many years paſt, undertaken one of them, which, when finiſhed, was not worth fifteen pounds; and by a computation ſince made, it did not coſt leſs than fifty, in the hire and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the people employed in it. This, indeed,
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:024452_0143_0FC73E39C4E2B798"/>
was at the age of ſeventeen, when the thoughtleſs inexperience of youth could alone excuſe ſuch a piece of folly.—<hi>Embroideries in gold, ſilver, or ſhades of ſilk,</hi> come within a narrower compaſs. Works of that kind, which may, without calling in expenſive aſſiſtance, or tiring the fancy, be finiſhed in a ſummer, will be a well-choſen change of amuſement, and may, as there are three of you, be made much more agreeable, by one alternately reading aloud, while the other two are thus employed.—All kinds of what is called <hi>plain-work,</hi> though no very polite accompliſhment, you muſt be ſo well verſed in, as to be able to cut out, make, and mend your own linen. Some fathers, and ſome huſbands, chooſe to have their daughters and their wives thus attired in the labour of their own hands, and, from a miſtaken notion, believe this to be the great criterion of frugal economy. Where that happens to be the inclination or opinion of either, it ought always to be readily complied with: but, excluſive of ſuch a motive, I ſee no other that makes the practical part neceſſary to any lady; excepting, indeed, where there is ſuch a narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of fortune as admits not conveniently the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſervant, to whom ſuch exerciſes of the needle much more properly appertain.</p>
            <p>The theatre, which, by the indefatigable labour of the inimitable Mr. Garrick, has been brought to very great perfection, will afford you an equally rational and improving entertainment. Your judgment will not now be called in queſtion, your underſtanding affronted, nor will your modeſty be offended by the indecent ribaldry of thoſe authors, who, to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in wit, have added the want of good ſenſe and of good manners. Faults of this kind, which, from a blameable compliance with a corrupted taſte, have ſometimes crept into the works of good wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, are, by his prudent direction, generally recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied or omitted on the ſtage. You may now ſee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the beſt plays performed in the beſt manner. Do not, however, go to any that you have not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore heard the character of: be preſent only at thoſe
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:024452_0144_0FC73E3C944EC6B8"/>
which are approved by perſons of underſtanding and virtue, as calculated to anſwer the proper end of the theatre, namely, that of conveying inſtruction in the moſt pleaſing method. Attend to the ſentiment, apply the moral, and then you cannot, I think, paſs an evening in a more uſeful, or in a more entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diverſion.</p>
            <p>Dancing may alſo take its turn, as a healthful exerciſe, as it is generally ſuitable to the taſte and gaiety of young minds.</p>
            <p>Part of the hours appropriated to relaxation muſt of neceſſity be leſs agreeably taken up in the paying and receiving viſits of mere ceremony and civility; a tribute, by cuſtom authorized, by good manners enjoined. In <hi>theſe,</hi> when the converſation is only inſignificant, join in it with an apparent ſatisfaction. Talk of the elegance of a birth-day ſuit, the pattern of a lace, the judicious aſſortment of jewels, the cut of a ruffle, or the ſet of a ſleeve, with an unaffected eaſe; not according to the rank they hold in your eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation, but proportioned to the conſequence they may be of in the opinion of thoſe you are converſing with. The great art of pleaſing is to appear pleaſed with others; ſuffer not then an ill-bred abſence of thought, or a contemptuous ſneer, ever to betray a conſcious ſuperiority of underſtanding, always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of ill-nature and diſlike. Suit yourſelf to the capacity and to the taſte of your company, when that taſte is confined to harmleſs trifles: but where it is ſo far depraved as to delight in cruel ſarcaſms on the abſent, to be pleaſed with diſcovering the blemiſhes in a good character, or in repeating the greater faults of a bad one, religion and humanity in that caſe forbid the leaſt degree of aſſent. If you have not any knowledge of the perſons thus unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily ſacrificed to envy or to malice, and conſequently are ignorant as to the truth or falſehood of ſuch aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, always ſuſpect them to be ill-grounded, or, at leaſt, greatly exaggerated. Show your diſappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation by a ſilent gravity, and by taking the firſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to change the ſubject. But where any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:024452_0145_0FC73E3DD1E8C720"/>
with the character in queſtion gives room for defending it, let not an ill-timed complaiſance prevail over juſtice: vindicate injured innocence with all the freedom and warmth of an unreſtrained bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence; and where the faults of the guilty will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of palliation, urge all that truth can allow in mitigation of error. From this method, beſides the pleaſure ariſing from the conſciouſneſs of a ſtrict con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the great rule of <hi>doing as you would be done by,</hi> you will alſo reap to yourſelf the benefit of being leſs fre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If, unfortunately, you have ſome acquaintance, whoſe malevolence of heart no ſentiment of virtue, no check of good-manners, can reſtrain from theſe malicious ſallies of ill-nature, to them let your viſits be made as ſeldom, and as ſhort as decency will permit; there being neither benefit nor ſatisfaction to be found in ſuch company, among whom only cards may be introduced with any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. On this account, it will be proper for you to know how to play at the games moſt in uſe; becauſe it is an argument of great folly to engage in any thing without doing it well; but this is a diverſion which, I hope, you will have no fondneſs for, as it is in itſelf, to ſay no worſe, a very inſignificant amuſement.</p>
            <p>With perſons for whom you can have no eſteem, good-breeding may oblige you to keep up an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of ceremonious viſits; but politeneſs enjoins not the length or frequency of them. Here inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be followed without a breach of civility: there is no tax upon intimacy but from choice; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

A plauſible behaviour often, upon a ſuperficial knowledge, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates a prepoſſeſſion in favour of particulars, who, upon a nearer view, may be found to have no claim to eſteem. The forming a precipitate judgment ſometimes leads into an unwary intimacy, which it
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:024452_0146_0FC73E3F03C77BC8"/>
may prove abſolutely neceſſary to break off: and yet that breach may be attended with innumerable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences; nay, perhaps, with very material and laſting ill conſequences: prudence, therefore, here enjoins the greateſt circumſpection.</p>
            <p>Few people are capable of friendſhip; and ſtill fewer have all the qualifications one would chooſe in a friend. The fundamental point is a virtuous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; but to that ſhould be added a good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, a ſolid judgment, ſweetneſs of temper, ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs of mind, freedom of behaviour, and ſincerity of heart. Seldom as theſe are to be found united, never make a boſom friend of any one greatly defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in either. Be ſlow in contracting friendſhip, and invariably conſtant in maintaining it.

The weakneſſes, the pains of the body may be inexpreſſibly alleviated by the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of a perſon, by affection endeared, by reaſon approved—whoſe tender ſympathy partakes your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, and ſhares your enjoyments—who is ſteady in the correction, but mild in the reproof of your faults—like a guardian angel, ever watchful to warn you of unforeſeen danger, and, by timely admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to prevent the miſtakes incident to human frailty and to ſelf-partiality: this is the true office of friendſhip. With ſuch a friend, no ſtate of life can be abſolutely unhappy; but, deſtitute of ſome ſuch connexion, heaven has ſo formed our nature for this intimate ſociety, that amidſt the affluence of fortune, and in the flow of uninterrupted health, there will be an aching void in the ſolitary breaſt, which can never otherwiſe know a plenitude of happineſs.</p>

            <p>Happy is her lot, who in a huſband finds this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable friend! Yet ſo great is the hazard, ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportioned the chances, that I could almoſt wiſh the dangerous die was never to be thrown for any of you: but as probably it may, let me conjure you all, my dear girls, if ever any of you take this moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant ſtep in life, to proceed with the utmoſt care and with deliberate circumſpection. Fortune and family it is the ſole province of your father to direct in: he, certainly, has always an undoubted right to a negative voice, though not to a compulſive one. As a child is very juſtifiable in the refuſal of her hand, even to the abſolute command of a father, where her heart cannot go with it; ſo is ſhe extremely culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in giving it, contrary to his approbation. Here I muſt take ſhame to myſelf; and for this unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fault, I do juſtly acknowledge that the ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ill conſequences of a moſt unhappy marriage were the proper puniſhment. This, and every other error in my own conduct, I do, and ſhall, with the utmoſt candour, lay open to you; ſincerely praying that you may reap the benefit of my experience, and that you may avoid thoſe rocks, which, either by careleſſneſs, or ſometimes, alas, by too much caution, I have ſplit againſt! But to return:—</p>
            <p>The chief point, to be regarded in the choice of <hi>a companion for life,</hi> is a really virtuous principle, an unaffected goodneſs of heart. Without this, you will
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:024452_0148_0FC73E4795728250"/>
be continually ſhocked by indecency, and pained by impiety. So numerous have been the unhappy vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tims to the ridiculous opinion, "<hi>A reformed libertine makes the beſt huſband<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </hi>" that, did not experience dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evince the contrary, one would believe it impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for a girl, who has a tolerable degree of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon underſtanding, to be made the dupe of ſo erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous a poſition, which has not the leaſt ſhadow of reaſon for its foundation, and which a ſmall ſhare of obſervation will prove to be falſe in fact. A man, who has been long converſant with the worſt ſort of women, is very apt to contract a bad opinion of, and a contempt for, the ſex in general. Incapable of eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeming any, he is ſuſpicious of all—jealous without cauſe—angry without provocation—and his own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed imagination is a continual ſource of ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. To this is frequently joined a bad habit of body, the natural conſequence of an irregular life, which gives an additional ſourneſs to the temper. What rational proſpect of happineſs can there be with ſuch a companion? And that this is the general character of thoſe who are called reformed rakes, obſervation will certify. But, admit there may be ſome exceptions, it is a hazard upon which no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate woman would venture the peace of her whole future life. The vanity of thoſe girls, who believe themſelves capable of working miracles of this kind, and who give up their perſons to men of libertine principles, upon the wild expectation of reclaiming them, juſtly deſerves the diſappointment which it will generally meet with; for, believe me, a wife is, of all perſons, the leaſt likely to ſucceed in ſuch an attempt. Be it your care to find that virtue in a lover, which you muſt never hope to form in a huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. Good-ſenſe and good-nature are almoſt equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly requiſite. If the former is wanting, it will be next to impoſſible for you to eſteem the perſon, of whoſe behaviour you have cauſe to be aſhamed; and mutual eſteem is as neceſſary to happineſs in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried ſtate as mutual affection: without the latter, every day will bring with it ſome freſh cauſe of vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation;
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:024452_0149_0FC73E49C0CF90B8"/>
'till repeated quarrels produce a coldneſs, which will ſettle into an irreconcileable averſion, and you will become not only each other's torment, but the object of contempt to your family and to your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance.</p>
            <p>This quality of good-nature is, of all others, the moſt difficult to be aſcertained, on account of the general miſtake of blending it with good-humour, as if they were in themſelves the ſame; whereas, in fact, no two principles of action are more eſſentially different. And this may require ſome explanation.— By good-nature I mean, that true benevol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nce which partakes in the felicity of all mankind; which promotes the ſatisfaction of every individual within the reach of its ability; which relieves the diſtreſſed, comforts the afflicted, diffuſes bleſſings, and communicates hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, as far as its ſphere of action can extend; and which, in the private ſeenes of life, will ſhine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous in the dutiful ſon, the affectionate huſband, the indulgent father, the faithful friend, and the compaſſionate maſter both to man and beaſt: while good humour is nothing more than a cheerful, pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deportment, ariſing either from a natural gaiety of mind, or from an affectation of popularity, join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to an affability of behaviour, the reſult of good-breeding, and a ready compliance with the taſte of every company. This kind of mere good-humour is, by far, the moſt ſtriking quality; 'tis frequently miſtaken for, and complimented with, the ſuperior name of real good-nature. A man by this ſpecious appearance has often acquired that appellation, who, in all the actions of his private life, has been a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe, cruel, revengeful, ſullen, haughty tyrant. Let them put on the cap, whoſe temples fit the galling wreath! On the contrary, a man of a truly benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent diſpoſition, and formed to promote the happineſs of all round him, may ſometimes, perhaps from an ill habit of body, an accidental vexation, or from a commendable openneſs of heart, above the meanneſs of diſguiſe, be guilty of little ſallies of peeviſhneſs, or of ill-humour, which, carrying the appearance of
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:024452_0150_0FC73E4CD98756E0"/>
ill-nature, may be unjuſtly thought to proceed from it, by perſons who are unacquainted with his true cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and who take ill-humour and ill-nature to be ſynonimous terms, though, in reality, they bear not the leaſt analogy to each other. In order to the forming a right judgment, it is abſolutely neceſſary to obſerve this diſtinction, which will effectually ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure you from the dangerous error of taking the ſhadow for the ſubſtance; an irretrievable miſtake, pregnant with innumerable conſequent evils!</p>
            <p>From what has been ſaid, it plainly appears, that the crite<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> on of this amiable virtue is not to be tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en from the general opinion; mere good-humour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to all intents and purpoſes, ſufficient in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular to eſtabliſh the public voice in favour of a man utterly devoid of every humane and benevolent affection of heart. It is only from the leſs conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſcenes of life, the more retired ſphere of action, from the artleſs tenor of domeſtic conduct, that the real character can with any certainty be drawn. Theſe, undiſguiſed, proclaim the man: but, as they ſhun the glare of light, nor court the noiſe of popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar applauſe, they paſs unnoticed, and are ſeldom known 'till after an intimate acquaintance. The beſt method, therefore, to avoid deception in this caſe, is to lay no ſtreſs on outward appearances, which are too often fallacious, but to take the rule of judging from the ſimple, unpoliſhed ſentiments of thoſe, whoſe dependent connexions give them an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable certainty; who not only ſee, but hourly feel the good or bad effects of that diſpoſition to which they are ſubjected. By this I mean, that if a man is equally reſpected, eſteemed, and beloved by his tenants, by his dependents and domeſtics—from the ſubſtantial farmer to the laborious peaſant—from the proud ſteward to the ſubmiſſive wretch, who, thankful for employment, humbly obeys the menial tribe—you may juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude he has that true good-nature, that real bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, which delights in communicating felicity, and enjoys the ſatisfaction it diffuſes. But if by theſe he is deſpiſed and hated, ſerved merely from a
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:024452_0151_0FC73E4F7B520130"/>
principle of fear, devoid of affection—which is very eaſily diſcoverable—whatever may be his public cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, however favourable the general opinion, be aſſured, that his diſpoſition is ſuch as can never be productive of domeſtic happineſs.—I have been the more particular on this head, as it is one of the moſt eſſential qualifications to be regarded, and of all others the moſt liable to be miſtaken.</p>
            <p>Never be prevailed with, my dear, to give your hand to a perſon, defective in theſe material points. Secure of virtue, of good-nature, and underſtanding in a huſband, you may be ſecure of happineſs. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the two former, it is unattainable: without the latter, in a tolerable degree, it muſt be very imperfect.</p>
            <p>Remember, however, that infallibility is not the property of man, or you may entail diſappointment on yourſelf, by expecting what is never to be found. The beſt men are ſometimes inconſiſtent with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. They are liable to be hurried, by ſudden ſtarts of paſſion, into expreſſions and actions which their cooler reaſon will condemn. They may have ſome oddities of behaviour, ſome peculiarities of temper; they may be ſubject to accidental ill-humour, or to whimſical complaints blemiſhes of this kind of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſhade the brighteſt character: but they are never deſtructive of mutual felicity, unleſs when they are made ſo by an improper reſentment, or by an ill-judged oppoſition. Reaſon can never be heard by paſſion; the offer of it tends only to inflame the more. When cooled, and in his uſual temper, the man of underſtanding, if he has been wrong, will ſuggeſt to himſelf all that could be urged againſt him: the man of good-nature will, un-upbraided, own his error: immediate contradiction is, therefore, wholly unſerviceable, and highly imprudent; and after repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition equally unneceſſary and injudicious. Any pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarities in the temper or behaviour ought to be properly repreſented in the tendereſt and in the moſt friendly manner, and if the repreſentation of them is made diſcreetly, it will generally be well taken: but if they are ſo habitual as not eaſily to be altered,
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:024452_0152_0FC73E5110D51CD0"/>
ſtrike not too often upon the unharmonious ſtring: rather let them paſs as unobſerved: ſuch a chearful compliance will better cement your union; and they may be made eaſy to yourſelf, by reflecting on the ſuperior good qualities by which theſe trifling faults are ſo greatly overbalanced.—You muſt remember, my dear, theſe rules are laid down, on the ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your being united to a perſon who poſſeſſes the three eſſential qualifications for happineſs before-mentioned. In this caſe, no farther direction is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, but that you ſtrictly perform the duty of a wife, namely, to love, to honour, and obey. The two firſt articles are a tribute ſo indiſpenſibly due to merit, that they muſt be paid by inclination; and they naturally lead to the performance of the laſt, which will not only be an eaſy but a pleaſing taſk, ſince nothing can ever be enjoined by ſuch a perſon that is in itſelf improper, and few things will, that can with any reaſon be diſagreeable to you.</p>
            <p>Here ſhould this ſubject end, were it not more than poſſible for you, after all that has been urged, to be led by ſome inferior motive, to the neglect of the primary caution; and that, either <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The being united to a man of irreligious principles makes it impoſſible to diſcharge a great part of the proper duty of a wife. To name but one inſtance, obedience will be rendered impracticable by frequent injunctions inconſiſtent with and contrary to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er obligations of morality. This is not ſuppoſition, but is founded upon facts, which I have too often ſeen and can atteſt. Where this happens, the reaſons for non-compliance ought to be offered in a plain, ſtrong, good-natured manner; there is, at leaſt, the chance of ſucceſs from being heard; but ſhould thoſe reaſons be rejected, or the hearing of them be refuſed, and ſilence on the ſubject enjoined—which is moſt probable, few people caring to hear what they know to be right, when determined not to appear convinced by it—obey the injunction, and urge not the argument farther: keep, however, ſteady to your principles, and ſuffer neither perſuaſion nor threats to prevail on you to act contary to them. All commands repugnant to the laws of chriſtianity, it is your indiſpenſible duty to diſobey; all requeſts that are inconſiſtent with pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or incompatible with the rank and character which you ought to maintain in life, it is your inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt to refuſe. A compliance with the former would be criminal; a conſent to the latter highly indiſcreet; and it might thereby ſubject you to general cenſure: for a man capable of requiring from his wife what he knows to be in itſelf wrong, is equally capable of throwing the whole blame of ſuch miſconduct on her, and of afterwards upbraiding her for a behaviour, to which he will, upon the ſame principle, diſown that he has been acceſſary. Many ſimilar inſtances have come within the compaſs of my own obſervation. In
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:024452_0154_0FC73E58756AED40"/>
things of a leſs material nature, that are neither cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal in themſelves nor pernicious in their conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, always acquieſce, if inſiſted on, however diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable they may be to your own temper and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Such a compliance will evidently prove that your refuſal in the other caſes, proceeds not from a ſpirit of contradiction, but merely from a juſt regard to that ſuperior duty, which can never be infringed with impunity.

               </gap> likely method, in time, to make a favourable impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. But, if you ſhould fail of ſuch ſucceſs, you will at leaſt enjoy that ſatisfactory ſelf-approbation, which is the inſeparable attendant of a truly religious and rational deportment.</p>
            <p>Should the painful taſk of dealing with a moroſe, tyrannical temper be aſſigned you, there is little more to be recommended, than a patient ſubmiſſion to an evil which admits not of a remedy. Ill-nature is increaſed, obſtinacy confirmed, by oppoſition: the leſs ſuch a temper is contradicted, the more ſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble will it be to thoſe who are under its baneful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence. When all endeavours to pleaſe are ineffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and when a man ſeems determined to find fault with every thing, as if his chief pleaſure conſiſted in tormenting thoſe about him, it requires a more than common degree of patience and reſolution to forbear uttering reproaches, which ſuch a behaviour may be juſtly allowed to deſerve: yet it is abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the maintaining any tolerable degree of eaſe, not only to reſtrain all expreſſions of reſentment, but to withhold even thoſe diſdainful looks which are apt to accompany a contemptuous ſilence; and they both equally tend only to increaſe the malady. This infernal delight in giving pain is moſt unwearied in the ſearch of matter for its gratification, and can ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther find, or unaccountably can form it, in almoſt all the occurrences of life; but, when ſuffered, unob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed and unregarded, to run its malicious courſe, it will quickly vent its blunted arrows, and will die of diſappointment; while all endeavours to appeaſe,
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:024452_0155_0FC73E5FBB181128"/>
all complaints of unkindneſs, will but ſharpen againſt yourſelf the weapon's edge, and, by proving your ſenſibility of the wound, will give the wiſhed-for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to him who inflicts it. Prudence, in this caſe, directs more than ordinary circumſpection, that every part of your behaviour may be as blameleſs as poſſible, even to the abſtaining from the leaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of evil; and after you have, to the utmoſt of your power, ſtrove to merit approbation, expect not to meet with it: by theſe means you will eſcape the mortification of being diſappointed, which, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten repeated, is apt to give a gloomy ſourneſs to the temper, incompatible with any degree of content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. You muſt, ſo ſituated, learn to be ſatisfied with the conſciouſneſs of acting right, according to your beſt abilities, and, if poſſible, you ſhould look with an unconcerned indifference on the reception of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unſucceſsful attempt to pleaſe.</p>
            <p>This, it muſt be owned, is a hard leſſon of philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy: it requires no leſs than an abſolute command over the paſſions; but let it be remembered, that ſuch a command will itſelf moſt amply recompenſe every difficulty: it will compenſate every pain, which it may coſt you to obtain it: beſides, it is, I believe, the only way to preſerve any tranquillity of mind, under ſo diſagreeable a connexion.</p>
            <p>As the want of underſtanding is by no art to be concealed, by no addreſs to be diſguiſed, it might be ſuppoſed impoſſible for a woman of ſenſe to unite her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to a perſon whoſe defect, in this inſtance, muſt render that ſort of rational ſociety which conſtitutes the chief happineſs of ſuch an union, impoſſible; yet, here, how often has the weakneſs of female judgment been conſpicuous! The advantages of great ſuperiority in rank or fortune have frequently prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo irreſiſtable a temptation, as, in opinion, to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh not only the folly but even the vices of its poſſeſſor: a grand miſtake, ever tacitly acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a ſubſequent repentance, when the expected pleaſures of affluence, equipage, and all the glittering pomp of uſeleſs pageantry have been experimentally
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:024452_0156_0FC73E60C5DB1988"/>
found inſufficient to make amends for the want of that conſtant ſatisfaction, which reſults from the ſocial joy of converſing with a reaſonable friend! But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever weak this motive muſt be acknowledged, it is more excuſable than another, which, I fear, has ſometimes had an equal influence on the mind; I mean ſo great a love of ſway, as to induce her to give the preference to a perſon of weak intellectuals, in hopes thereby of holding, uncontrouled, the reins of government. The expectation is, in fact, ill-grounded obſtinacy: and pride being generally the companion of folly, the ſillieſt people are uſually the moſt tenacious of their opinions, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the hardeſt of all others to be managed: but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the contrary, the principle is in itſelf bad: it tends to invert the order of nature, and to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act the deſign of Providence.</p>
            <p>A woman can never be ſeen in a more ridiculous light, than when ſhe appears to govern her huſband. If, unfortunately, the ſuperiority of underſtanding is on her ſide, the apparent conſciouſneſs of that ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority betrays a weakneſs, that renders her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible in the ſight of every conſiderate perſon, and it may, very probably, fix in his mind a diſlike never to be eradicated. In ſuch a caſe, if it ſhould ever be your own, remember that ſome degree of diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is commendable, ſo far as to let your huſband's defect appear unobſerved. When he judges wrong, never flatly contradict, but lead him inſenſibly into another opinion, in ſo diſcreet a manner that it may ſeem entirely his own; and let the whole credit of every prudent determination reſt on him, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging the fooliſh vanity of claiming any merit to yourſelf. Thus a perſon of but an indifferent capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city may be ſo aſſiſted as, in many inſtances, to ſhine with a borrowed luſtre, ſcarcely diſtinguiſhable from the native, and, by degrees, he may be brought into a kind of mechanical method of acting properly, in all the common occurrences of life. Odd as this poſition may ſeem, it is founded in fact; and I have ſeen the method ſucceſsfully practiſed by more than
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:024452_0157_0FC73E623B130FE8"/>
one perſon, where a weak mind, on the governed ſide, has been ſo prudently ſet off as to appear the ſole director; like the ſtatue of the Delphic god, which was thought to give forth its own oracles, while the humble prieſt, who lent his voice, was by the ſhrine concealed, nor ſought a higher glory than a ſuppoſed obedience to the power he would be thought to ſerve.</p>
            <p>From hence it may be inferred, that by a perfect propriety of behaviour, eaſe and contentment, at leaſt, are attainable with a companion who has not the moſt exalted underſtanding: but then, virtue and good-nature are preſuppoſed, or there will be nothing to work upon.</p>
            <p>A vicious, ill-natured fool being ſo untractable and tormenting an aſſociate, there needs only to add jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy to the compoſition, to make the curſe complete. This paſſion, once ſuffered to get footing in the heart, is hardly ever to be extirpated: it is a conſtant ſource of torment to the breaſt that gives it reception, and is an inexhauſtible fund of vexation to the object of it. With a perſon of this unfortunate diſpoſition, it is prudent to avoid the leaſt appearance of conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. A whiſper in a mixed company, a meſſage given in low voice to a ſervant, have, by the power of a diſturbed imagination, been magnified into a material injury. Whatever has the air of ſecrecy raiſes terror in a mind naturally diſtruſtful. A per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, unreſerved openneſs, both in converſation and behaviour, ſtarves the anxious expectation of diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and may very probably lead into an habitual confidence, the only antidote againſt the poiſon of ſuſpicion. It is eaſier to prevent than remove a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ill impreſſion; and, conſequently, it is much wiſer to be ſometimes deficient in little points of civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which, however indifferent in themſelves, may happen unaccountably to claſh with the eaſe of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whoſe repoſe it is both your duty and intereſt to promote. It is much more commendable, contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to incur the cenſure of a trifling diſpoſition, by a circumſtantial, unaſked relation of inſignificant inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:024452_0158_0FC73E63B7B95D98"/>
than to give any room for apprehending the leaſt degree of reſerve. Such a conſtant method of proceeding, together with a reaſonable compliance, is the moſt likely to cure this painful turn of mind; for, by with-holding every ſupport that could give ſtrength to it, the want of matter to feed on may probably in time cauſe its extinction. If, unhappily, it is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional, ſo interwoven with the ſoul as to become, in a manner, inſeparably united with it, nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains but to ſubmit patiently to the will of heaven, under the preſſure of an unalterable evil; to guard carefully againſt the natural conſequence of repeated undeſerved ſuſpicions, namely, a growing indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which too frequently terminates in averſion; and, by conſidering ſuch a ſituation as a trial of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and reſignation, to receive the comfort that muſt ariſe from properly exerciſing one of the moſt exalted of the chriſtian virtues. I cannot diſmiſs this ſubject without adding a particular caution <hi>to yourſelf</hi> concerning it.</p>
            <p>Jealouſy is, on ſeveral accounts, ſtill more inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable in a woman. There is not any thing that ſo much expoſes her to ridicule, or ſo much ſubjects her to the inſult of affrontive addreſſes: it is an inlet to almoſt every poſſible evil, the fatal ſource of innumer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able indiſcretions, the ſure deſtruction of her own peace, and is frequently the bane of her huſband's affection. Give not a momentary harbour to its ſhadow in your heart; fly from it, as from the face of a fiend, that would lead your unwary ſteps into a gulf of unalterable miſery. When once embarked in the matrimonial voyage, the fewer faults you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover in your partner, the better. Never ſearch after what it will give you no pleaſure to find; never deſire to hear what you will not like to be told; therefore avoid that tribe of impertinents, who, either from a malicious love of diſcord, or from the meaner, though leſs criminal motive of ingratiating themſelves by gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying the blameable curioſity of others, ſow diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wherever they gain admittance; and by telling unwelcome truths, or, more frequently, by inſinuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

invented falſehoods, injure innocent people, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb domeſtic union, and deſtroy the peace of families. Treat theſe emiſſaries of Satan with the contempt they deſerve; hear not what they offer to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, but give them at once to underſtand, that you can never look on thoſe as your friends, who ſpeak in a diſadvantageous manner of that perſon whom you would always chooſe to ſee in the moſt favourable light. If they are not effectually ſilenced by ſuch rebukes, be inacceſſible to their viſits, and break off all acquaintance with ſuch incorrigible peſts of ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who will be ever upon the watch to ſeize an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded opportunity of diſturbing your repoſe.</p>
            <p>Should the companion of your life be guilty of ſome ſecret indiſcretions, run not the hazard of being told by theſe malicious meddlers, what, in fact, it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for you never to know: but if ſome unavoidable accident betrays an imprudent correſpondence, take it for a mark of eſteem, that he endeavours to conceal from you what he knows you muſt, upon a principle of reaſon and religion, diſapprove: and do not, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering your acquaintance with it, take off the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint which your ſuppoſed ignorance lays him under, and thereby, perhaps, give a latitude to undiſguiſed irregularities. Be aſſured whatever accidental ſallies the gaiety of inconſiderate youth may lead him into, you can never be indifferent to him, whilſt he is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to preſerve your peace, by concealing what he imagines might be an infringement of it. Reſt then ſatisfied, that time and reaſon will moſt certainly get the better of all faults which proceed not from a bad heart; and that, by maintaining the firſt place in his eſteem, your happineſs will be built on too firm a foundation to be eaſily ſhaken.</p>
            <p>I have been thus particular on the choice of a huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and on the material parts of conduct in a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried life, becauſe thereon depends not only the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, but often the eternal felicity of thoſe who enter into that ſtate; a conſtant ſcene of diſagreement, of ill-nature and quarrels, neceſſarily unfitting the mind for every religious and ſocial duty, by keeping it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

a diſpoſition directly oppoſite to that chriſtian piety, to that practical benevolence and rational compoſure, which alone can prepare it for everlaſting happineſs.</p>
            <p>Inſtructions on this head, conſidering your tender age, may ſeem premature, and ſhould have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, 'till occaſion called for them, had our ſituation allowed me frequent opportunities of communicating my ſentiments to you; but that not being the caſe, I chooſe, in this epiſtle, at once to offer you my beſt advice in every circumſtance of great moment to your well being, both here and hereafter, leſt at a more proper ſeaſon it may not happen to be in my power. You may defer the particular conſideration of this part, 'till the deſign of entering into a new ſcene of life may make it uſeful to you; which, I hope, will not be for ſome years; an unhappy marriage being more generally the conſequence of a too early engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, before reaſon has gained ſufficient ſtrength to form a ſolid judgment, on which only a proper choice can be determined. Great is the hazard of a miſtake, and irretrievable the effects of it! Many are the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees between happineſs and miſery! Abſolute miſery, I will venture to affirm, is to be avoided by a proper behaviour, even under all the complicated ills of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man life; but to arrive at that proper behaviour, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the higheſt degree of chriſtian philoſophy. And who would voluntarily put themſelves upon a ſtate of trial ſo ſevere, in which not one of a thouſand has been found able to come off victorious? Between this and poſitive happineſs there are innumerable ſteps of comparative evil; each has its ſeparate conflict, variouſly difficult, differently painful, under all which a patient ſubmiſſion and a conſcious propriety of beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour is the only attainable good. Far ſhort, indeed, of poſſible temporal felicity is the eaſe ariſing from hence! Reſt not content with the proſpect of ſuch eaſe, but fix on a more eligible point of view, by aiming at true happineſs; and, take my word, <hi>that</hi> can never be found in a married ſtate, without the three eſſential qualifications already mentioned, vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, good-nature, and good-ſenſe, in a huſband.
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:024452_0161_0FC73E6FB67CAB60"/>
Remember, therefore, my dear girl, this repeated caution, if you ever reſolve on marriage, never to give your hand to a man who wants either of them, whatever other advantages he may be poſſeſſed of; ſo ſhall you not only eſcape all thoſe vexations which thouſands of unthinking mortals hourly repent of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought upon themſelves; but, moſt aſſuredly, if it is not your own fault, you will enjoy that uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted domeſtic harmony, in the affectionate ſociety of a virtuous companion, which conſtitutes the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſatisfaction of human life. Such an union, found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on reaſon and religion, cemented by mutual eſteem and tenderneſs, is a kind of faint emblem, if the compariſon may be allowed, of the promiſed reward of virtue in a future ſtate; and moſt certainly, it is an excellent preparative for it, by preſerving a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect equanimity, by keeping a conſtant compoſure of mind, which naturally lead to the proper diſcharge of all the religious and ſocial duties of life, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring road to everlaſting peace. The firſt have been already ſpoken to; it remains only to mention ſome few of the latter.</p>
            <p>Among theſe, ECONOMY may, perhaps, be thought improperly placed; yet many of the duties we owe to ſociety being often rendered impracticable by the want of it, there is not ſo much impropriety in rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it under this head, as may at firſt be imagined. For inſtance, a man who lives at an expenſe beyond what his income will ſupport, lays himſelf under a neceſſity of being unjuſt, by with-holding from his creditors what they have a right to demand from him as their due, according to all laws both human and divine: and thereby he often entails ruin on an innocent family, who, but for the loſs ſuſtained by his extravagance, might have comfortably ſubſiſted on the profits of their induſtry. He likewiſe puts it out of his own power to give that relief to the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, which, by the laws of humanity, they have a right to expect; the goods of fortune being given, as a great divine excellently obſerves, for the uſe and ſupport of others, as well as for the perſon on whom
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:024452_0162_0FC73E7159619EA0"/>
they are beſtowed. Theſe are ſurely great breaches of that duty we owe to our fellow-creatures, and are effects very frequently and naturally produced by the want of economy.</p>
            <p>You will find it a very good method, ſo to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late your ſtated expenſes as to bring them always one-fourth part within your certain annual income: by theſe means you will avoid being at any time diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed by unforeſeen accidents, and you will have it more eaſily in your power materially to relieve thoſe who deſerve aſſiſtance. But the giving trifling ſums, <hi>indiſcriminately,</hi> to ſuch as appear neceſſitous, is far from being commendable; it is an injury to ſociety; it is an encouragement to idleneſs, and helps to fill the ſtreets with lazy beggars, who live upon miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied bounty, to the prejudice of the induſtrious poor. Theſe are uſeful members of the commonwealth; and on them ſuch benefactions might be ſerviceably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed. Be ſparing, therefore, in this kind of indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminate donations; they are too conſtantly an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant relief to the receivers, ſuppoſing them really in want; and, frequently repeated, they amount to a conſiderable ſum in the year's account. The proper objects of charity are thoſe, who by unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able misfortunes have fallen from affluent circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances into a ſtate of poverty and diſtreſs; thoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, who, by unexpected diſapointments in trade, are on the point of being reduced to an impoſſibility of carrying on that buſineſs, on which their preſent ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence and their future proſpect in life depend, from the incapacity of raiſing an immediate ſum to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount the difficulty; and thoſe who, by their utmoſt induſtry, can hardly ſupport their families above the miſeries of want; or who, by age or by illneſs, are ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered incapable of labour. Appropriate a certain part of your income to the relief of theſe real diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes. To the firſt, give as largely as your circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances will allow; to the ſecond, after the example of an excellent prelate of our own church, lend, if it is in your power, a ſufficient ſum to prevent the threatened ruin, on condition of being repaid the
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:024452_0163_0FC73E72E015E5D0"/>
loan, without intereſt, if Providence enables them, by future ſucceſs, to do it with convenience. The ſame method may be uſed where indigence renders induſtry unavailable, by depriving it of the means to lay in a ſmall original ſtock to be improved. Never take a note of hand or any acknowledgment of ſuch loan, leſt what you intended for a benefit, ſhould be afterwards made the inſtrument of ruin to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, by a different diſpoſition in your ſucceſſor. But ſuch aſſiſtance ought not to be given to any, without a thorough knowledge of their character, and having good reaſon to believe them not only induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious, but ſtrictly honeſt, which will be a ſufficient obligation on them for the repayment: and the ſums ſo repaid ought to be laid by, 'till an opportunity again offers of making them in like manner ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to others. The latter ſort, who are able to work, may, by a ſmall addition to the profits of their own labour, be reſcued from miſery, and may be put into a comfortable way of ſubſiſtence. Thoſe who, by age or by infirmity, are rendered utterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of ſupporting themſelves, have an undoubted right, not only to the neceſſaries, but even to ſome of the conveniencies of life, from all, whom Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence has placed in the more happy ſtate of affluence and independence.</p>
            <p>As your fortune and ſituation are yet undetermin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I have purpoſely laid down ſuch rules as may be adapted to every ſtation. A large fortune gives greater opportunity of doing good, and of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating happineſs in a more extenſive degree: but a ſmall one is no excuſe for with-holding a proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate relief from real and deſerving objects of compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. To aſſiſt them is an indiſpenſible duty of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity. The firſt and great commandment is, to love God with all your heart; the ſecond, to love your neighbour as yourſelf: <hi>Whoſo ſeeth his brother in need, and ſhutteth up his bowels of compaſſion, how dwelleth the love of God in him?</hi> or how the love of his neighbour? If deficient in theſe primary duties, vain are the hopes of acceptance, built on a partial
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:024452_0164_0FC73E7AA84DCB78"/>
obedience to the leſſer branches of the law!—Inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is often pleaded as an excuſe for the want of charity, by perſons who make no ſcruple of daily la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing on their pleaſures, what, if better applied, might have made an indigent family happy through life. Theſe perſons loſe ſight of real felicity, by the miſtaken purſuit of its ſhadow: the pleaſures, which engroſs their attention, die in the enjoyment, are often ſucceeded by remorſe, and always by ſatiety; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the true joy, the ſweet complacency reſulting from benevolent actions, increaſes by reflexion, and muſt be immortal as the ſoul. So exactly, ſo kindly is our duty more to coincide with our preſent as well as future intereſt, that incomparably more ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will accrue to a conſiderate mind from denying it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf even ſome of the agreeables of life, in order the more effectually to relieve the unfortunate, than could ariſe from a full indulgence of every temporal gratification.</p>
            <p>However ſmall your income may be, remember that a part of it is due to merit in diſtreſs. Set by an annual ſum for this purpoſe, even though it ſhould oblige you to abate ſome neceſſary expenſe to raiſe the fund: by this method, perſons of ſlender fortune have been enabled to do much good, and to give happineſs to many. If your ſtock will not admit of frequent draughts upon it, be the more circumſpect with regard to the merit of thoſe you relieve, that bounties, not in your power to repeat often, may not be miſapplied. But if Providence, by a more ample fortune, ſhould bleſs you with a larger ability of being ſerviceable to your fellow-creatures, prove yourſelf worthy of the truſt repoſed in you, by making a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per uſe of it. Wide as your influence can extend, turn the cry of diſtreſs and danger into the ſong of joy and ſafety; feed the hungry, clothe the naked, comfort the afflicted, give medicine to the ſick, and, with either, beſtow all the alleviation their unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate circumſtances can admit of. Thus may you truly make a friend of the unrighteous mammon. Thus you may turn the periſhable goods of fortune
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:024452_0165_0FC73E7DEBA53BA8"/>
into everlaſting bleſſings. Upon earth you will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take that happineſs you impart to others; and you will lay up for yourſelf <hi>treaſures in heaven, where neither moth nor ruſt can corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor ſteal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A perſon who has once experienced the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of a right action, will be led by the motive of preſent ſelf-intereſt, as well as by future expectation, to the continuance of it. There is no injunction of chriſtianity that a ſincere chriſtian, by obedience, will not find ſo calculated, as to be directly, in ſome meaſure, its own reward.</p>
            <p>The forgiveneſs of injuries, to which is annexed the promiſe of pardon for our own offences, (and which is required by the goſpel, not only ſo far as to forbear all kinds of retaliation, but alſo to render us equally diſpoſed to ſerve with our utmoſt power thoſe perſons who have wilfully injured us, as if no ſuch injury had been received from them) has by ſome been accounted a hard precept<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet the difficulty of it ariſes merely from, and is proportionable to, the badneſs of the heart by which it is ſo eſteemed. A good diſpoſition finds a ſuperlative pleaſure in return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good for evil; and, by an inexpreſſible ſatisfaction of mind in ſo doing, feels the preſent reward of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: whereas a ſpirit of revenge is incompatible with happineſs, an implacable temper being a conſtant torment to its poſſeſſor; and the man who returns an injury, feels more real miſery from the rancour of his own heart, than it is in his power to inflict upon another.</p>
            <p>Should a friend wound you in the moſt tender part, by betraying a confidence repoſed, prudence forbids the expoſing yourſelf to a ſecond deception, by placing any future truſt in ſuch a perſon. But though here all obligations of intimacy ceaſe, thoſe of benevolence and humanity remain ſtill in full force, and are equally binding, and call for every act of ſervice and aſſiſtance, even to the ſuffering a leſſer evil yourſelf, in order to ſecure a much greater good to the perſon by whom you have been thus ill-uſed. This

is in general allowed to be the duty of every indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual to all, as a member of ſociety; but it is particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtanced in the preſent caſe, to ſhow, that not even a breach of friendſhip, the higheſt of all provocations, will cancel the duty, at all times equally and unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably binding—the duty of promoting both the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and eternal happineſs of all your fellow creatures by every method in your power.</p>
            <p>It has been by many thought impertinent at any time to offer unaſked advice; the reaſon of which maybe chiefly owing to its being too frequently ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with a ſupercilious air, that implies a conceited conſciouſneſs of ſuperior wiſdom: it is the manner, therefore, more than the thing itſelf, which gives diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt.</p>
            <p>If thoſe, with whom you have any degree of inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, are guilty of what to you appears either wrong or indiſcreet, ſpeak your opinion to them with free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, though you ſhould even loſe a nominal friend by ſo doing. Silence makes you, in ſome meaſure, an acceſſary to the fault: but having thus once diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged your duty, reſt there: they are to judge for themſelves: to repeat ſuch admonitions is both uſeleſs and impertinent, and they will then be thought to proceed rather from pride than from good nature. To the perſons concerned only are you to ſpeak your diſapprobation of their conduct: when they are cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by others, ſay all that truth or probability will permit in their juſtification.</p>
            <p>It often happens, that upon an accidental quarrel between friends, they ſeparately appeal to a third perſon. In ſuch caſe, alternately take the oppoſite ſide, alleging every argument in favour of the abſent party, and placing the miſtakes of the complainer in the ſtrongeſt light. This method may probably at firſt diſpleaſe, but is always right, as it is the moſt likely to procure a reconciliation. If that takes place, each, equally obliged, will thankfully approve your conduct: if not, you will have the ſatisfaction of, at leaſt, endeavouring to have been the reſtorer of peace. A contrary behaviour, which generally proceeds
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:024452_0167_0FC73E8037C98268"/>
from the mean deſire of pleaſing by flattery, at the expenſe of truth, often widens a trifling breach into open and irreconcileable enmity. People of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition are the worſt ſort of incendiaries, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt plague of human ſociety, becauſe the moſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to be guarded againſt, from their always wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſpecious diſguiſe of pretended approbation and friendſhip to the preſent, and equally deceitful reſentment againſt the abſent perſon or company.</p>
            <p>To enumerate all the ſocial duties would lead me too far; ſuffice it therefore, my dear, in a few words to ſum up what remains.</p>
            <p>Let truth ever dwell upon your tongue.</p>
            <p>Scorn to flatter any, and deſpiſe the perſon who would practice ſo baſe an art upon yourſelf.</p>
            <p>Be honeſtly open in every part of your behaviour and converſation.</p>
            <p>All, with whom you have any intercourſe, even down to the meaneſt ſtation, have a right to civility and good-humour from you. A ſuperiority of rank or fortune is no licenſe for a proud, ſupercilious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour: the diſadvantages of a dependant ſtate are alone ſufficient to labour under; 'tis both unjuſt and cruel to increaſe them, either by a haughty deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or by the unwarrantable exerciſe of a caprici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous temper.</p>
            <p>Examine every part of your conduct towards others by the unerring rule of ſuppoſing a change of places. This will certainly lead to an impartial judgment. Do then what appears to you right, or, in other words, <hi>what you would th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Be religious without hypocriſy, pious without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm.</p>
            <p>Endeavour to merit the favour of God by a ſincere and uniform obedience to whatever you know, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, to be his will; and ſhould afflictive evils be permitted to cloud the ſun-ſhine of your brighteſt days, receive them with ſubmiſſion; ſatisfied that a

being equally wiſe, omniſcient, and beneficent, at once ſees and intends the good of his whole creation; and that every general or particular diſpenſation of his providence, towards the rational part of it, is ſo calculated as to be productive of ultimate happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which nothing but the miſbehaviour of indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals can prevent to themſelves.</p>
            <p>This truth is ſurely an unanſwerable argument for abſolute reſignation to the will of God; and ſuch a reſignation, founded upon reaſon and choice, not enforced by neceſſity, is unalterable peace of mind, fixed on too firm a baſis to be ſhaken by adverſity. Pain, poverty, ingratitude, calumny, and even the loſs of thoſe we hold moſt dear, may each tranſiently affect, but, united, cannot mortally wound it. Upon this principle, you will find it poſſible not only to be content, but cheerful, under all the diſagreeable cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances this ſtate of probation is liable to; and, by making a proper uſe of them, you may effectually remove the garb of terror from the laſt of all tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral evils. Learn, then, with grateful pleaſure to meet approaching death as the kind remover of every pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſenſation, the friendly guide to perfect and to everlaſting happineſs.</p>
            <p>Believe me, this is not mere theory. My own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience every moment proves the fact undeniably true. My conduct, in all thoſe relations which ſtill ſubſiſt with me, nearly as human imperfection will allow, is governed by the rules here laid down for you; and it produces the conſtant rational compoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>re, which conſtitutes the moſt perfect felicity of human life: for with truth I can aver, that I daily feel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably more real ſatisfaction, more true content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in my preſent retirement, than the gayeſt ſcenes of feſtive mirth ever afforded me. I am pleaſed with this life, without an anxious thought for the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it; and am happy in the hope of hereafter exchanging it for a life infinitely better. My ſoul, unſtained by the crimes unjuſtly imputed to me, moſt ſincerely forgives the malicious authors of theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations: it anticipates the future pleaſure of an open

acquittal, and, in that expectation, loſes the pain of preſent and undeſerved cenſure. By this is meant the inſtance that was made the ſuppoſed foundation for the laſt of innumerable injuries which I have received, through him, from whom I am conſcious of having deſerved the kindeſt treatment. Other faults, no doubt, I might have many; to him I had very few: nay, for ſeveral years, I cannot, upon reflexion, accuſe myſelf of any thing but of a too abſolute, too unreſerved obedience to every injunction, even where plainly contrary to the dictates of my own reaſon. How wrong ſuch a compliance was, has been clearly proved by many inſtances, in which it has been ſince moſt ungenerouſly and moſt ungratefully urged as a circumſtantial argument againſt me.</p>
            <p>It muſt, indeed, be owned, that for the two or three laſt years, tired with a long ſeries of repeated inſults, of a nature almoſt beyond the power of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination to conceive, my temper became ſoured: a conſtant, fruitleſs endeavour to oblige was changed into an abſolute indifference about it; and ill humour occaſioned by frequent diſappointment—a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence I have experimentally warned you againſt— was perhaps ſometimes too much indulged. How far the unequalled provocations may be allowed as an excuſe for this, heaven only muſt determine, whoſe goodneſs has thought fit to releaſe me from the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſituation; though by a method, at preſent, not the moſt eligible, as it is the cauſe of a ſeparation <hi>from my children alſo,</hi> and thereby has put it out of my power to attend, in the manner I could have wiſhed, to their education; a duty that inclination would have led me with equal care and pleaſure more amply to fulfil, had they continued under my direction. But as Providence has thought fit other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to determine, contented I ſubmit to every diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, convinced that all things are ordered for the beſt, and that they will, in the end, work together for good to them that fear God, and who ſincerely endeavour to keep his commandments. If in theſe
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:024452_0170_0FC73E8979DF52A8"/>
I err, I am certain it is owing to a miſtake in the judgment, not to a defect of the will.</p>
            <p>Thus have I endeavoured, my dear girl, in ſome meaſure, to compenſate both to you and to your ſiſters the deprivation of a conſtant maternal care, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing you according to my beſt ability, in the moſt material parts of your conduct through life, as parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly as the compaſs of a letter would allow me.

            <head>THE LADIES' LIBRARY. Advice of a Mother to her Daughter.</head>
            <byline>By the Marchioneſs de Lambert.</byline>
            <p>THE world has, in all ages, been very negligent in the education of daughters; all their care is laid out entirely upon the men; and, as if the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were a diſtinct ſpecies, they leave them to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves without any helps, without thinking that they compoſe one half of the world; that the two ſexes are neceſſarily united together by alliances; that the women make either the happineſs or miſery of the men, who always feel the want of having them rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable; that they are a great means of the riſe and ruin of families; that they are entruſted with the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation of the children in their early youth, a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of life in which they receive the livelieſt and deepeſt impreſſions. What would they have them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire into their children, when, from their very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, they are left themſelves in the hands of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernantes, who, as they are generally taken out of the low world, inſpire them with low ſentiments, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage all the timorous paſſions, and form them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

them down from the mother to the children, than how to ſecure their eſtates by entails. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, therefore, is ſo much miſtaken as the educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they give to young women: they deſign them to pleaſe; they give them no inſtructions but for the ornament and graces of the body; they flatter their ſelf-love; they give them up to effeminacy, to the world and to falſe opinions; they give them no lectures of virtue and fortitude: ſurely it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable or rather downright madneſs to imagine that ſuch an education ſhould not turn to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice.</p>
            <p>It may be neceſſary, my daughter, to obſerve all the outward rules of <hi>decorum;</hi> but this is not enough to gain you the eſteem of the world; 'tis the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the mind that form the character of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; that lead the underſtanding; that govern the will; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>at ſecure the reality and duration of all our virtues: but religion ſhould be the principle and foundation of theſe ſentiments. When religion is once engraven on our heart, all the virtues will na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally flow from that ſource; all the duties of life will be regularly practiſed in their reſpective order. 'Tis not enough for the conduct of young perſons, to oblige them to do their duty; they muſt be brought to love it. Authority is a tyrant only over the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward behaviour; it has no ſway over the inward ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents. When one preſcribes a conduct, we ſhould repreſent the reaſons and the motives of it, and give them a reliſh for what we adviſe them.</p>
            <p>'Tis ſo much for our intereſt to practiſe virtue, that we ſhould never conſider it as our enemy, but rather as the ſource of happineſs, of glory, and of peace.</p>
            <p>You are juſt coming into the world: enter it, my daughter, with ſome principles: you cannot fortify yourſelf too much againſt what you will meet with there: bring along with you all your religion: nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh it in your heart by your ſentiments; confirm it in your mind by proper reflexions, and by reading adapted to encourage it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="177" facs="unknown:024452_0173_0FC73E9326677F48"/>There is nothing more neceſſary, and indeed more happy for us than to keep up a ſentiment that makes us love and hope; that gives us a proſpect of an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable futurity; that reconciles all times; that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures all the duties of life; that anſwers for us to ourſelves, and is our guarantee with regard to others. What a ſupport will you find from religion under the misfortunes that threaten you! for a certain number of misfortunes muſt fall to your ſhare. 'Twas a ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of one of the ancients,
<q>That he wrapped him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up in the mantle of his virtue:</q>
Wrap yourſelf up in that of your religion; it will be a great help to you againſt the weakneſs of youth, and a ſure refuge in your riper years.</p>
            <p>Women, who have cultivated their underſtanding with nothing but the maxims of the world, are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented at laſt with an univerſal blank, and find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a terrible want of thought and employment, the moſt irkſome ſituation in life. As they advance in age, the world quits them, and reaſon tells them they ſhould quit the world; but where muſt they go for relief? The time paſt furniſhes us with regrets, the preſent with inquietudes, and the time to come with fears. Religion alone calms all our uneaſineſs, and comforts us under all misfortunes: by uniting you to God, it reconciles you with the world, and yourſelf too.</p>
            <p>A young perſon, when ſhe comes into the world, frames to herſelf an high notion of the happineſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for her. She ſets herſelf to obtain it; 'tis the ſource of all her cares. She is always on the hunt after her notion, and in hopes of finding a perfect happineſs: this is the occaſion of lightneſs and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy.</p>
            <p>The pleaſures of the world are deceitful; they promiſe more than they perform; the queſt of them is full of anxiety: their enjoyment is far from yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any true ſatisfaction, and their loſs is attended with vexation.</p>
            <p>To fix your deſires, think that no ſolid or laſting happineſs is to be found any where but in your own
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:024452_0174_0FC73E9477BAA1D0"/>
breaſt. Honours and riches have no charms that are laſting for any length of time: their poſſeſſion extends our view, and gives us new deſires. Pleaſures, when they grow familiar, loſe their reliſh. Before you have taſted them, you may do without them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as enjoyment makes that neceſſary to you, which was once ſuperfluous, and you are worſe at your eaſe than you were before. By enjoying them you grow uſed to them, and when you loſe them, they leave you nothing but emptineſs and want. What affects us ſenſibly is the paſſage from one circumſtance of life to another; the interval between a miſerable ſeaſon and a happy one. The ſenſe of pleaſure wears off as ſoon as we grow habituated to it. 'Twould be a great advantage, if reaſon could at once lay before us all that is neceſſary for our happineſs. Experience brings us back to ourſelves; ſpare yourſelf that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>d lay it early down for a maxim, with a firmneſs and reſolution to determine your conduct, that
<q>true felicity conſiſts in peace of mind, in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and in the diſcharge of our duty.</q>
Let us not fancy ourſelves happy, my daughter, till we feel our pleaſures of this ſort flow from the bottom of our ſoul.</p>
            <p>Theſe reflexions ſeem too ſtrong for a young per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and are proper for a riper age: however, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you are capable of them; and beſides, I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing myſelf. We cannot engrave the precepts of wiſdom too deeply in our hearts; the impreſſions that they make are always too light; but it can't be denied that ſuch as uſe themſelves to make reflexions, and fortify their hearts with principles, are in a fairer way to virtue than ſuch as neglect them. If we are unhappy enough to be defective in the practice of our duty, let us at leaſt not be wanting in our affection to it: let us then, my daughter, make uſe of theſe precepts for a continual help to our virtue.</p>
            <p>'Tis commonly ſaid, there are two prejudices with which every body muſt comply: religion and honour. 'Tis a wrong expreſſion to call religion a prejudice. A prejudice is an opinion that may be ſubſervient to
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:024452_0175_0FC73E98F5BA5560"/>
error as well as truth; the term ought never to be applied but to things that are uncertain; and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not ſo.</p>
            <p>Honour is, indeed, an invention merely human; yet nothing is more real than the evils that people ſuffer who would get rid of it; 'twould be dangerous to ſhake it off; we ſhould rather do all we can to fortify a ſentiment that ought to be a rule to our conduct, ſince nothing is more deſtructive of our quiet, or makes our life more unequal, than to think one way and act another. Poſſeſs your heart as much as is poſſible with ſentiments for the conduct that you ought to obſerve; fortify this prejudice of honour in your mind; you cannot be too ſcrupulouſly nice on this ſubject.</p>
            <p>Never warp in the leaſt from theſe principles; never entertain a notion, as if the virtue of women was a virtue only enjoined by cuſtom; nor allow yourſelf to think you have ſufficiently diſcharged your obligations if you can but eſcape the eyes of the world. There are two courts before which you muſt inevitably appear in judgment, your conſcience and the world; you may poſſibly get clear of the world, but you can never get clear of conſcience. Secure her teſtimony in favour of your honeſty; 'tis what you owe to yourſelf; but withal do not neglect the approbation of the public; for a contempt of reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion naturally leads to a contempt of virtue.</p>
            <p>When you are a little acquainted with the world, you will find that there is no need of the ſanctions and terror of laws to keep you within the bounds of your duty: the example of ſuch as have deviated from it, and the calamities that have ever attended them, is enough to ſtop any inclination in the midſt of its career; for there is no coquet but muſt own, if ſhe would be ſincere, that it is the greateſt misfortune in the world to be forgotten and neglected.</p>
            <p>Shame is a paſſion that might be of excellent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to us, if we managed it well: I do not mean that falſe ſhame which only ſerves to diſturb our quiet, without being of any ſervice to our behaviour;
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:024452_0176_0FC73E9D14C419E0"/>
I ſpeak of that which keeps us from evil, out of fear of diſhonour: we muſt confeſs, this ſhame is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the ſureſt guard of the women's virtue; there are very few virtuous for virtue itſelf.</p>
            <p>There are ſome great virtues, which, when they are carried to a certain degree, make a great many defects be overlooked; ſuch as extraordinary valour in the men, and extreme modeſty in the women. Agrippina, the wife of Germanicus, was excuſed of all her faults on account of her chaſtity. This princeſs was ambitious and haughty; but, ſays Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,
<q>all her paſſions were conſecrated by her chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity.</q>
            </p>
            <p>If you are ſenſible and nice in the point of repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, if you are apprehenſive of being attacked as to eſſential virtues, there is one ſure mean to calm your fears, and ſatisfy your nicety; 'tis to be virtuous. Be ſure always to keep well with yourſelf; 'tis a ſure income of pleaſures; and will gain you praiſe, and a good reputation beſides; in a word, be but truly virtuous, and you'll find admirers enough.</p>
            <p>The virtues that make a figure in the world do not fall to the women's ſhare; their virtues are of a ſimple and peaceable nature: fame will have nothing to do with us. 'Twas a ſaying of one of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, that "the great virtues are for the men!" he allows the women nothing but the ſingle merit of being unknown; and
<q>ſuch as are moſt praiſed, (ſays he) are not always the perſons that deſerve it beſt; but rather ſuch as are not talked of at all.</q>
The notion ſeems to me to be wrong; but to reduce this maxim into practice, I think it beſt to avoid the world and making a figure, which always ſtrikes at modeſty, and be contented with being one's own ſpectator.</p>
            <p>The virtues of the women are difficult, becauſe they have no help from glory to practiſe them. To live at home—to meddle with nothing but one's ſelf and family—to be ſimple, juſt, and modeſt—are pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful virtues, becauſe they are obſcure. One muſt have a great deal of merit, to ſhun making a figure, and a
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:024452_0177_0FC73E9E63D58DB0"/>
great deal of courage to bring one's ſelf to be virtuous only to one's own eyes. Grandeur and reputation ſerve for ſupports to our weakneſs, for ſuch, in reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is our deſire to diſtinguiſh and raiſe ourſelves. The mind reſts in the public approbation: but true glory conſiſts in being ſatisfied without it. Let it not enter, then, into the motives of your actions: 'tis enough that it is the recompence of them.</p>
            <p>Be aſſured, my daughter, that perfection and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs cling together; that you can never be happy but by virtue, and ſcarcely ever unhappy but by ill conduct. Whoſoever examine themſelves ſtrictly, will find that they never had any grievous affliction, but they occaſioned it themſelves by ſome fault, or by being wanting in ſome duty. Anxiety always follows the loſs of innocence: but virtue is ever attended with an inward ſatisfaction, that is a conſtant ſpring of felicity to all its votaries.</p>
            <p>Do not, however, imagine that your only virtue is modeſty; there are abundance of women that have no notion of any other, and fancy, that by practiſing it they diſcharge all the duties of ſociety: they think they have a right to neglect all the reſt, and to be as proud and cenſorious as they pleaſe. Anne of Bretagne, a proud and imperious princeſs, made Lewis XII. ſuffer exceedingly; and the good prince was uſed to ſay when he ſubmitted to her humour, "we muſt pay dear for the women's chaſtity." Make nobody pay for yours; think rather that it is a virtue which regards only yourſelf, and loſes its greateſt luſtre, if it be not attended with the other virtues.</p>
            <p>We ſhould be very tender in our modeſty; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward corruption paſſes from the heart to the mouth, and occaſions looſe diſcourſe. The moſt violent paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions have need of modeſty to ſhow themſelves in a ſeducing form: it ſhould diſtinguiſh itſelf in all your actions; it ſhould ſet off and embelliſh all your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>They ſay, that when Jove formed the paſſions, he aſſigned every one of them its diſtinct abode. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty

            <p>Let the chief part of your finery then be modeſty: it has great advantages; it ſets off beauty, and ſerves for a veil to uglineſs: modeſty is the ſupplement of beauty. The great misfortune of uglineſs, is, that it ſmothers and buries the merit of women. People do not go to look in a forbidding figure for the engaging qualities of the mind and heart; 'tis a very difficult affair, when merit muſt make its way, and ſhine through a diſagreeable outſide.</p>
            <p>You do not want graces to make you agreeable; but you are no beauty: this obliges you to lay up a ſtock of merit: the world will compliment you with nothing. Beauty has great advantages. One of the ancients ſaid of it, that it was
<q>a ſhort tyranny, and the greateſt privilege in nature; that handſome perſons carry letters of recommendation in their looks.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Beauty inſpires a pleaſing ſentiment, which prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes people in its favour. If you have made no ſuch impreſſions, you muſt expect to be taken to pieces. Take care that there be nothing in your air or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to make any body think that you do not know yourſelf: an air of confidence, in an ordinary figure, is ſhocking enough. Let nothing in your diſcourſe or dreſs look like art; at leaſt, let it not be eaſy to find it out; the moſt refined art never lets itſelf be ſeen.</p>
            <p>You are not to neglect the accompliſhments and ornaments proper to make you agreeable; for women are deſigned to pleaſe; but you ſhould rather think
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:024452_0179_0FC73EA71BC33550"/>
of acquiring a ſolid merit, than of employing your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in trifling things. Nothing is ſhorter than the reign of beauty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nothing is more melancholy than the latter part of the lives of women, who never knew any thing but that they were handſome. If any body makes their court to you for the ſake of your agreeable accompliſhments, make their regards centre in friendſhip, and ſecure the continuance of that friendſhip by your merits.</p>
            <p>'Tis a difficult matter to lay down any ſure rules to pleaſe. The graces, without merit, cannot pleaſe long: and merit, without the graces, may command the eſteem of men, but can never move them. Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, therefore, muſt have an amiable merit, and join the graces to the virtues. I do not confine the merit of women merely to modeſty; I give it a much larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er extent. A valuable woman exerts the manly vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of friendſhip, probity, and honour, in the punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual diſcharge of all her obligations. An amiable wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhould not only have the exterior graces but all the graces of the heart and fine ſentiments of the mind. There is nothing ſo hard as to pleaſe, without being ſo intent upon it, that it ſhall look a little like coquetry. Women generally pleaſe the men of the world more by their faults than their good qualities. The men are for making their advantages of the weakneſſes of amiable women: they would have nothing to do with their virtues; they do not care to eſteem them; they had much rather be amuſed by perſons of little or no merit, than be forced to admire ſuch as are virtuous.</p>
            <p>One muſt know human nature, if one deſigns to pleaſe. The men are much more affected with what is new, than with what is excellent: but the flower of novelty ſoon fades; what pleaſed when it was new, ſoon diſpleaſes when it grows common. To keep up this taſte of novelty, we muſt have a great many reſources and various kinds of merit within ourſelves; we muſt not ſtick only at the agreeable ccompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: we muſt ſtrike their fancy with a variety of graces and merits, to keep up their inclinations, and
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:024452_0180_0FC73EA97A8FC688"/>
make the ſame object afford them all the pleaſures of inconſtancy.</p>
            <p>Women are born with a violent deſire to pleaſe. As they find themſelves barred from all the ways that lead to glory and authority, they take another road to arrive at them, and make themſelves amends by their agreeableneſs. Beauty impoſes on the perſon that has it, and infatuates the ſoul; yet remember, that there is but a very ſmall number of years differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between a fine woman and one that is no longer ſo. Get over this exceſſive deſire to pleaſe; at leaſt keep from ſhowing it. We muſt not be extravagant in our dreſs, or let it take up all our time; the real graces do not depend on a ſtudied finery: we muſt ſubmit to the mode as a troubleſome ſort of ſlavery, but comply with it no more than we are obliged in decency. The mode would be reaſonable, if it could be fixed to a point of perfection, convenience, and gracefulneſs; but to be always changing, is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, rather than politeneſs and a good taſte.</p>
            <p>A good taſte avoids all exceſſive niceneſs; it treats little things as little ones, and gives itſelf very little trouble about them. Neatneſs is, indeed, agreeable, and deſerves to be ranked among things that are grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; but it commences littleneſs, when it is carried to an exceſs: it is a much better temper to be careleſs in things of little conſequence, than to be too nice about them.</p>
            <p>Young perſons are very ſubject to the ſpleen; as they are quite deſtitute of knowledge, they run with eagerneſs towards ſenſible objects; their ſpleen, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, is the leaſt evil they have to dread: exceſſive joys are no part of the train of virtue. All violent and moving pleaſures are dangerous. Though one is diſcreet enough not to break through the rules of decency, and to keep within the bounds of modeſty; yet when the heart is once moved with the pleaſure it feels, a ſort of ſoftneſs diffuſes itſelf over the ſoul, and takes away its reliſh for every thing that is called virtue; it ſtops and makes you cool in the practice of your duty. A young perſon does not ſee the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:024452_0181_0FC73EAAF9754250"/>
of this flattering poiſon, the leaſt miſchief of which is to diſturb the quiet of life, to deprave the taſte, and render all ſimple pleaſure inſipid. When one ſees a young perſon happy enough not to have had her heart touched (as there is a natural diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in us to a union, and this diſpoſition has not been exerciſed), ſhe eaſily complies, and gives her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf naturally to the perſon deſigned for her.</p>
            <p>Be very cautious on the article of plays, and the like public diverſions. There is no dignity in ſhowing one's ſelf continually, nor is it an eaſy matter to preſerve a ſtrict modeſty in a conſtant hurry of diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. It is miſtaking one's intereſt to frequent them: If you have beauty, you muſt not wear out the taſte of the world by ſhowing yourſelf continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally: you muſt be ſtill more reſerved if you want graces to ſet you off; beſides, the conſtant uſe of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions leſſens the reliſh of them.</p>
            <p>When all your life has been ſpent in pleaſures, and they come to leave you, either becauſe your taſte for them is over, or becauſe your reaſon forbids you the enjoyment of them, your mind finds itſelf in a moſt uneaſy ſituation for want of employment. If you would, therefore, have your pleaſures and amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments laſt, uſe them only as diverſions to relieve you after more ſerious occupations. Entertain your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with your own reaſon; keep up that correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and the abſence of pleaſures will not leave you any time upon your hands, nor any hankering after them.</p>
            <p>It behoves us, therefore, to huſband our taſtes; there is no reliſhing life without them: but innocence only can preſerve them in their integrity; irregularity is ſure to deprave them.</p>
            <p>When we have found a heart, we make an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of every thing, and turn it into a ſource of pleaſures. We come frequently to pleaſures with a ſick's man's palate: we fancy ourſelves nice, when we are only ſurfeited and out of taſte. When we have not ſpoiled our mind and heart by ſentiments that ſeduce the fancy, or by any flaming paſſion, it
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:024452_0182_0FC73EB15A58B870"/>
is eaſy to find delight; health and innocence are the true fountains of joy. But when we have had the misfortune to habituate ourſelves to vehement plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, we become inſenſible to moderate ones. We ſpoil our taſte by diverſions, and uſe ourſelves ſo much to violent pleaſures, that we cannot take up with ſuch as are ſimple and regular.</p>
            <p>We ſhould always dread ſuch great emotions of the ſoul as leave us flat and out of ſorts. Young perſons have the greater reaſon to fear them, in that they are leſs capable of reſiſting what flatters their ſenſe. "Temperance," ſaid one of the ancients, "is the beſt caterer for luxury." With this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, which makes the health both of mind and body, one has always a pleaſing and an equal joy; one has no need of diverſions and expenſe; reading, work, and converſation, afford a purer joy than all the train of the greateſt pleaſures. In a word, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent delights are of moſt advantage; they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ready at hand; they are beneficent, and are never purchaſed at too dear a rate. Other pleaſures flatter, but they do miſchief: they alter the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the mind, and ſpoil it like that of the body.</p>
            <p>Be regular in all your views and in all your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; it would be happy if our fortune was ſuch as to make computation of our income unneceſſary; but as yours is narrow, it obliges you to be regular. Be diſcreet in the article of your expenſes; if you do not obſerve a moderation in them, you will ſoon ſee your affairs in diſorder: as ſoon as you lay aſide economy, you can anſwer for nothing.</p>
            <p>Pompous living is the high road to ruin; and the ruin of people's fortune is almoſt always followed with corruption of manners: but in order to be regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, it is no way neceſſary to be covetous. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that avarice is of little ſervice, and diſhonours a perſon infinitely. All that one ſhould aim at, in a regular management, is to avoid the ſhame and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice that always attend an irregular conduct. We muſt retrench ſuperfluous expenſes only to be in a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:024452_0183_0FC73EB353E7CF58"/>
condition to afford ſuch as decency, friendſhip, and charity engage us to make.</p>
            <p>It is good order, and not the looking into little matters, that turns to any great account. Pliny, when he ſent his friend back a bond for a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſum which his father owed him, with a general acquittance, told him,
<q>I have but a ſmall eſtate, and am obliged to be at great expenſes; but my frugality ſerves for a fund to ſupply me wherewith to do the ſervice that I render to my friends.</q>
Borrow from your fancies and diverſions, that you may have ſomething to gratify the ſentiments of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity, which every perſon of a genteel ſpirit ought to have.</p>
            <p>Never mind the wants that vanity creates.
"We muſt be"
they ſay, "like others;" this <hi>like</hi> goes a vaſt way. Have a nobler emulation, and allow nobody <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o have more honour, probity, and integrity than yourſelf. Be always ſenſible of the neceſſity of virtue: poorneſs of ſoul is worſe than poverty of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
            <p>Whilſt you are young, form your reputation; raiſe your credit; put your affairs in order: you would have more trouble about it in another ſeaſon of life. Charles the fifth uſed to ſay, that
<q>fortune loved young folks.</q>
In the time of youth, all the world offer themſelves to you, and lend you a helping hand: young people govern without thinking of it. But in more advanced age, you have no helps from any quarter; you have no longer that bewitching charm which has an influence on every body: you have nothing for you but reaſon and truth, which do not ordinarily govern the world.</p>
            <p>"You are going," ſaid Montaigne to ſome young people,
<q>towards reputation and credit; but I am returning back.</q>
When you ceaſe to be young, you have no acquiſition left you to make, but in point of virtue. In all your undertakings and actions, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways aim at the higheſt perfection; form no project, and ſet about nothing without ſaying to yourſelf, "Could not I do better?" By this means you will
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:024452_0184_0FC73EB662667520"/>
inſenſibly contract a habit of juſtice and virtue, which will make the practice thereof eaſier to you. Do what Seneca adviſed his friend Lucilius: "Chooſe," ſaid he to him,
<q>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mong great men ſome one that you think is moſt to be admired: do nothing but in his preſence; give him an account of all your actions.</q>
Happy the man that is eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed enough to be pitched on for this purpoſe! This is the more eaſy, becauſe young folks have a natural diſpoſition to imitation. They run leſs hazard when they chooſe their patterns from antiquity, where we generally meet with none but great exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. Among the moderns it may have its incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences; the copies of them very rarely ſucceed. It has been ſaid long ago, that every copy ought to tremble before its original; they never follow it but at a diſtance: and yet it takes away your natural character, which is generally the trueſt and the moſt ſimple. You are apt to grow negligent as to yourſelf, when you fix yourſelf to a model; beſides, a great part of our faults come from imitation. Learn then to reverence and ſtand in awe of yourſelf: let your ſcrupulouſneſs be your own cenſor.</p>
            <p>Uſe all your application to make yourſelf happy in your ſtation of life; improve all the means you have: you loſe a thouſand advantages for want of it. It is our attention, and comparing of things, that makes us happy.</p>
            <p>The more addreſs and capacity you have, the more will you make of your circumſtances, and the more will you extend your pleaſures. It is not poſſeſſion that makes us happy; it is enjoyment; and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment lies in attention.</p>
            <p>If people knew how to enjoy themſelves in their condition, they would not be troubled either with ambition or envy, and would be bleſſed with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect tranquillity: but we do not live enough in the preſent moment; our deſires and hopes are always puſhing us on towards futurity.</p>
            <p>There are two ſorts of madmen in the world; the one always live upon futurity, and feed themſelves
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:024452_0185_0FC73EB8812AF340"/>
with nothing but hopes; and as they are not wiſe enough to calculate them rightly, they paſs their lives in a continual miſtake. Reaſonable perſons are never taken up with any deſires, but ſuch as are within their reach: they often gain their point, and though they ſhould be miſtaken, they would eaſily conſole them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under the diſappointment; they know likewife that our fondneſs for things wears off upon the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of them, or ceaſes upon ſeeing the impoſſibility of obtaining what we deſire: wiſe men always make themſelves eaſy with ſuch reflexions. There is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort of madmen, that make too much of the preſent, and take no manner of care for futurity; they ruin their fortune, their reputation, and their taſte of life, by not managing them diſcreetly. Men of ſenſe join theſe two times together; they enjoy the preſent, and yet do not neglect the future.</p>
            <p>It is a duty, my daughter, to employ our time; but what uſe do we make of it? Few people know how to value it as it deſerves.
<q>Account to your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</q>
ſays one of the ancients,
<q>for every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your time; that after making a juſt uſe of the preſent, you may have leſs occaſion for the future.</q>
Time flies with rapidity: learn to live, that is, to make a good uſe of your time; but life is ſpent too often in vain hopes, in queſt of fortune, or in waiting for it. All mankind feel the vanity of their condition, always taken up without being ever ſatisfied. Remember, that life does not conſiſt in the ſpace of time that you live, but in the uſe you ſhould make of it: conſider, that you have a mind to cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate and feed with truth—a heart to purify and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate—and a religious worſhip to pay to the Deity.</p>
            <p>As the firſt years of life are precious, remember, daughter, to make an advantageous uſe of them. While the mind eaſily receives impreſſions, embelliſh your memory with valuable things, and conſider, that you are laying in a proviſion for your whole life. The memory is formed and improved by exerciſing it.</p>
            <p>Curioſity is a ſentiment that you ſhould not ſtifle: it wants only to be managed, and placed on a right
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:024452_0186_0FC73EB9F7DA4378"/>
object. Curioſity is a knowledge begun, which makes you advance farther and quicker in the road of truth: it is a natural diſpoſition that meets inſtruction half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: it ſhould not be ſtopped by lazineſs and love of eaſe.</p>
            <p>It is very uſeful for young perſons to employ their time in ſolid ſciences; the Greek and Roman hiſtory elevate the mind, and raiſe the courage by the great actions that we ſee there related. We ought not to be ignorant of the hiſtory of our own country. I ſhould not even blame a little philoſophy, eſpecially the new, if one has a capacity for it; it helps to give you a clear judgment, to diſtinguiſh your ideas, and to teach you to think juſtly. I would likewiſe have a little morality: by the bare reading of Cicero, Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and others, one gets a taſte for virtue: it makes an inſenſible impreſſion on us, that is of great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to our morals. The inclination to vice is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by the example of ſo many virtues, and you will rarely find an evil diſpoſition have any reliſh for this ſort of reading. We do not love to ſee what is always upbraiding and condemning us.</p>
            <p>As for languages, though a woman ought to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with ſpeaking that of her own country, I ſhould not thwart the inclination one might have for Latin. It opens you a gate to all the ſciences: it lets you into converſation with the beſt part of the world in all ages. Women are ready enough to learn Italian: but I think it dangerous; it is the language of love: the Italian writers are not very correct; you ſee in all their works a jingle of words, and a looſe imagination, inconſiſtent with a juſt way of thinking.</p>
            <p>Poetry may produce ſome inconveniencies: I ſhould however be loth to forbid the reading of the fine tragedies of Corneille: but the beſt of them often give you lectures of virtue, and leave you an impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of vice.</p>
            <p>The reading of romances is ſtill more dangerous: I would not have them much uſed; they inure the mind to falſehoods. Romances having no foundation of truth to ſupport them, warm the imagination, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:024452_0187_0FC73EBEA0E34BD8"/>
modeſty, put the heart in diſorder, and if a young perſon have but the leaſt diſpoſition to tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they hurry on and fire her inclination. One ſhould not increaſe the charms and deluſions of love; the more it is ſofte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> dangerous it is. I would not forbid them; all prohibitions intrench upon liberty, and raiſe the deſire: but we ſhould, as much as we are able, uſe ourſelves to ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> teach one nothing but a vaſt deal of vanity: they depreſs the activity of the ſoul. If you have a very warm and active ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, and a curioſity which nothing can ſtop, it is much better to employ theſe diſpoſitions in the ſciences, than to run the hazard of their being turned to ſerve your paſſions: but remember, that a young lady ſhould have almoſt as nice a modeſty in the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of ſciences, as ſhe has with regard to vice.</p>
            <p>Guard yourſelf therefore againſt the inclination of ſetting up for a virtuoſo; do not amuſe yourſelf in running after vain ſciences, and ſuch as are above your reach. Our ſoul is much better qualified for enjoyment than it is for knowledge; we have all the knowledge that is proper and neceſſary for our well being; but we will not ſtick there; we are ſtill run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning after truths that were not deſigned for us.</p>
            <p>Before we engage in enquiries, that are above our capacities, we ſhould know the juſt extent of our underſtanding, and what rule we ſhould have for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terming our perſuaſion: we ſhould learn to diſtinguiſh between opinion and knowledge, and ſhould have reſolution enough to doubt, when we have no clear notion of things, as well as courage to be ignorant of what ſurpaſſes us.</p>
            <p>The better to prevent a vain opinion of our capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and abate a confidence in our underſtanding, let us conſider that the two principles of all our
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:024452_0188_0FC73EC2246D5140"/>
knowledge, reaſon and the ſenſes, want ſincerity, and often deceive us. The ſenſes impoſe on reaſon; and reaſon miſleads them in its turn. Theſe are our two guides, and both of them lead us out of the way. Such reflexions ſhould naturally put us out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit with abſtracted ſciences; it is much better for us to employ our time in uſeful points of knowledge.</p>
            <p>Docility is a quality very neceſſary for a young perſon, who ſhould never have much confidence in herſelf: but this docility muſt not be carried too far. In point of religion, indeed, it muſt ſubmit to autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; but on any other ſubject it muſt receive nothing but from reaſon and evidence. By carrying docility too far, you do an injury to your reaſon; you make no uſe of your own judgment and underſtanding, which are impared for want of exerciſe. You ſet too narrow bounds to your ideas, when you confine them to thoſe of other people. The teſtimony of men only deſerves credit in proportion to the degree of certainty which they have acquired by examining into facts. There lies no preſcription againſt truth: it is for all perſons and all times. In a word, as a great man ſays,
<q>To be a chriſtian, one muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve implicitly: but to be a wiſe man, one muſt ſee clearly.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Accuſtom yourſelf to exerciſe your underſtanding, and make more uſe of it than of your memory. We <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We fancy that we have made a great progreſs, when we load our memory with hiſtories and facts; but this is of very little ſervice to perfect our underſtanding. We muſt uſe ourſelves to thinking.

            <p>Among our ſex the art of thinking is a ſort of dormant talent. Hiſtorical facts, and the opinions of philoſophers, will not defend you againſt a cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity that preſſes you: you will not find yourſelf much the ſtronger for them. When an affliction comes upon you, you have recourſe to Seneca and Epicte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus:

Is it for their reaſon to give you conſolation? Is it not rather the buſineſs of your own? Make uſe of your own ſtock; in the calm of life, make a proper proviſion againſt the time of affliction, which you are ſure to meet with: you will find yourſelf much better ſupported by your own reaſon than by that of other people.</p>
            <p>If you can govern your imagination, and make it ſubmit to reaſon and truth, it will be a great ſtep towards your perfection and happineſs. Women are generally governed by their imagination; as they are not employed in any thing ſolid, and are not in the courſe of their lives troubled either with the care of their fortune, or the management of their affairs, they give themſelves up entirely to their pleaſures. Plays, dreſs, romances, and inclinations, all depend upon imagination. I know well enough, that if you keep it within due bounds, you take ſo much off from your pleaſures; for imagination is the ſource of them; and the things that pleaſe us moſt, derive from her the charm and illuſion in which all their agreeableneſs conſiſts: but for one pleaſure of her creating, what evils doth ſhe not make us ſuffer? She ſtands continually between truth and us: Reaſon dares not ſhow herſelf, where imagination bears the ſway. We ſee only as ſhe pleaſes; and thoſe that are led by her, know what they ſuffer from her by woful experience. It would be a very happy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to make with her, to give her back all her pleaſures on condition that ſhe made you feel none of her pains: in a word, there is nothing ſo incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with happineſs, as a fine, lively, and too heated imagination.</p>
            <p>Poſſeſs yourſelf with a true notion of things, and take not up with the ſentiments of the people: form your own judgment without giving into received opinions, and get over the prejudices of your infancy. When you feel yourſelf under any uneaſineſs, take the following method: I have found the uſe of it: Examine into the occaſion of your trouble; ſtrip it of all the diſguiſe that is about it, and of all the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidery
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:024452_0190_0FC73EC84152CE60"/>
of imagination, and you will find that it is generally nothing at all, or at leaſt great allowances are to be made. Value things only according to their real worth. We have a great deal more reaſon to complain of our falſe notions than of our fortune; it is very frequently not ſo much things that hurt us, as the opinion we have of them.</p>
            <p>In order to be happy, we muſt think rightly: we owe a great reſpect to the common opinions, when they concern religion; but we ought to think very differently from the vulgar in what regards morality and the happineſs of life. By the vulgar, I mean every body that has a low and vulgar way of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the court is filled with ſuch ſort of creatures; and the world talks of nothing but fortune and credit; all the cry there is,
<q>Go on, make haſte forward;</q>
whereas wiſdom ſays,
<q>Take up with ſimple things; chooſe an obſcure but quiet life; get out of the hurry of the world; avoid a croud.</q>
Fame is not all the recompenſe of virtue; the main part of it lies in the teſtimony of your own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. A great virtue is ſurely enough to comfort you for the loſs of a little glory.</p>
            <p>Be aſſured, that the greateſt ſcience is to know how to be independent. "I have learnt," ſaid one of the ancients,
<q>to be my own friend, ſo I ſhall never be alone.</q>
You muſt provide yourſelf ſome reſources againſt the inquietudes of life, and ſome equivalent for the goods you had depended on. Secure yourſelf a retreat and a place of refuge in your own breaſt; you can always return thither, and be ſure to find yourſelf again. When the world is leſs neceſſary to you, it will have leſs power over you: when you do not, by ſome ſolid inclinations place your dependence on yourſelf, you depend upon every thing elſe.</p>
            <p>Uſe yourſelf to ſolitude: there is nothing more uſeful and neceſſary to weaken the impreſſion that ſenſible objects make upon us. You ſhould therefore from time to time retire from the world to be alone. Aſſign ſome hours in the day for reading, and for

making your own reflexions. "Reflexion," ſays a father of the church,
<q>is the eye of the ſoul; it lets light and truth into it.</q>
—
<q>I will lead him into ſolitude,</q>
ſays wiſdom,
<q>and there I will ſpeak to his heart.</q>
It is there, indeed, where truth gives her inſtructions; where prejudices vaniſh, where prepoſſeſſion wears off, and where opinion, that governs all, begins to loſe its influence. When one conſiders the uſeleſſneſs and inſignificancy of life, one is forced to ſay with Pliny,
<q>It is much better to paſs one's life in doing nothing at all, than in doing trifles of nothing.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I have told you already, daughter, that happineſs conſiſts in peace of mind: you cannot enjoy the pleaſures of the mind without health of mind: every thing almoſt is a pleaſure to a ſound mind. If you would live with tranquillity, theſe are the rules you are to obſerve. The firſt is, not to give yourſelf up to things that pleaſe; to uſe them only occaſionally; not to expect too much from the men, for fear of being diſappointed; to be your own principal friend. Solitude too will inſure you tranquillity, and is a friend to wiſdom: it is within you, that peace and truth take up their abode. Avoid the great world; there is no ſecurity in it; it always awakens ſome ſentiment or other that we had almoſt cruſhed; there are but too many people in it that encourage looſeneſs; the more one converſes with it, the more authority do one's paſſions gain: it is hard to reſiſt the attack of vice, when it comes ſo well attended: in a word, one comes back from it much weaker, leſs modeſt, and more unjuſt, for having been among the men. The world eaſily inſtils its poiſon into tender ſouls. We ſhould likewiſe ſhut up all the avenues to the paſſions; it is much eaſier to keep them off, than van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh them; and though one ſhould be happy enough to baniſh them, yet from the time that they made their impreſſion, they make us pay dear for their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode. The firſt motions of them is what cannot be refuſed to nature; but ſhe often carries her influence too far; and when you come to yourſelf again, you find abundant reaſon to repent.</p>

            <p>A favourite, raiſed to the height of grandeur, was ſhowing his riches to a friend. As he took out a box, he ſaid to him,
<q>Here it is that my treaſure lies.</q>
His friend preſſed him to ſhow it him, and he allowed him to open the box: there was nothing in it but an old ragged coat. His friend ſeemed ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed at it: the favourite ſaid to him,
<q>When for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune ſhall ſend me back to my original condition, I am ready for it.</q>
What a noble reſource it is to conſider every thing at the worſt, and feel fortitude enough in one's ſelf to ſtand the ſhock!</p>
            <p>How ſtrongly ſoever you wiſh for any thing, begin with examining the thing you wiſh: ſet before your eyes the good which it promiſes you, and the evils that follow it: remember the paſſage of Horace,
<q>Pleaſure goes before you, but keeps her retinue out of ſight.</q>
You will ceaſe to fear, as ſoon as ever you ceaſe to deſire. Depend upon it a wiſe man does not run after felicity, but makes his own happineſs: it muſt be your own doing, and it is in your own power. Remember, that a very ſmall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will ſerve for all the real wants of life; but there muſt be an infinite deal to ſatisfy the imaginary wants of opinion; and that you will much ſooner reduce your deſires to the level of your fortune, than raiſe your fortune to the level of your deſires. If honours and riches could ſatiate us, we might heap them up; but the thirſt of them increaſes by acquiring them: he that deſires moſt, is certainly the moſt indigent.</p>
            <p>Young perſons live upon hope. M. de la Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foucault ſays,

            <p>Our ſelf-love makes us blind to ourſelves, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhes all our defects. We live with them as we do with the perfumes that we wear; we do not ſmell them; they only incommode others: to ſee them in their right light we muſt ſee them in other people.

Examine your own nature, and make the beſt of your defects: there is none of them but may be tacked to ſome virtues, and be made to favour them. Morality does not propoſe to deſtroy nature, but to perfect it. Are you vain-glorious? Make uſe of that ſentiment to raiſe yourſelf above the weakneſſes of your ſex, and to avoid the faults that abaſe it. Every unruly paſſion has a pain and ſhame annexed to it, which ſolicit you to quit it. Are you timorous? Turn that weakneſs into prudence; let it keep you from expoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yourſelf. Are you laviſh? Do you love to give? It is eaſy to turn prodigality into generoſity. Give with choice and judgment; but do not neglect indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent people: lend when it is neceſſary; but give to ſuch as cannot return your kindneſs; by ſo doing you ſtrike in with your inclination, and do good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: there is no weakneſs, but, if you pleaſe, vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue can make a good uſe of it.</p>

               </gap> make you ſenſible of your little ſtock of merit, inſtead of fretting and oppoſing the opinion that you have of yourſelf to the injuſtice which you pretend has been done you, conſider that the perſons who are the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of it are better able to judge of you than you are yourſelf; that you ſhould ſooner believe them than ſelf-love, which always flatters; and that with regard to what concerns yourſelf, your enemy is nearer truth than you are: that you ſhould have no merit in your own eyes, but what you have in other
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:024452_0194_0FC73ED447B9BCC8"/>
people's. One has too great a diſpoſition to flatter one's ſelf, and men are too near themſelves, to judge impartially in the caſe.</p>
            <p>Theſe are general precepts for oppoſing the vices of the mind: but your firſt care ſhould be to perfect your heart and your ſentiments: it depends on your heart to make your virtue ſure and laſting; it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly that which forms your character; and to make yourſelf miſtreſs of it, obſerve this method. When you feel yourſelf agitated with a ſtrong and violent paſſion, deſire it to allow you a little time, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound with your weakneſs. If, without hearing it a moment, you are for ſacrificing every thing to your reaſon and your duty, there is room to fear that your paſſion may rebel, and grow ſtronger than ever. You are under its command, and muſt manage it with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs: you will receive more help than you think, from ſuch a conduct: you will find ſome ſure remedies even in your paſſion. If it be that of hatred, you will ſee that you have not altogether ſo much reaſon to hate and revenge yourſelf, as you at firſt imagined. If, by misfortune, it be the contrary ſentiment that has ſeized you, there is no paſſion which furniſhes you ſurer remedies againſt itſelf.</p>
            <p>If your heart has the misfortune to be attacked by love, theſe are the remedies to ſtop its progreſs: think that its pleaſures are neither ſolid nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant; they quit you; and if this was all the harm they would do you, 'tis enough. In paſſions, the ſoul propoſes itſelf an object, and is more intimately unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it either by deſire or enjoymemt, than it is to its own being; it places all its felicity in its poſſeſſion, and all its miſery in the loſs of the object. Yet this felicity of the imagination, this good of the ſoul's choice, is neither ſolid nor laſting: it depends upon others; it depends upon yourſelf; and you cannot anſwer either for others or for yourſelf.</p>
            <p>Love, in the beginning, offers you nothing but flowers, and hides all the danger from you; it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes on you; it always takes ſome form which is not its own: the heart being in ſecret intelligence with
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:024452_0195_0FC73ED6DAD9C780"/>
it, conceals its inclination from you, for fear of alarming your reaſon and modeſty. You fancy it a mere amuſement; it is only the perſon's wit or good ſenſe that pleaſes us. In a word, love is almoſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways unknown, till he has got the maſtery. As ſoon as he comes to be felt, fly that inſtant, and hearken not to the complaints of your heart. Love is not rooted out of the ſoul with ordinary efforts; it has too many partizans within us: as ſoon as it has ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed you, every thing is on its ſide againſt you, and nothing will ſerve you againſt love. It is the moſt cruel ſituation a rational perſon can be in— where there is nothing to ſupport you—where you have no ſpectator but yourſelf. You muſt ſummon up your courage immediately; and remember, that you muſt make a much more ſorrowful uſe of it, if you yield to your paſſion in the leaſt.</p>
            <p>Reflect upon the fatal conſequences of paſſions, and you will find but too many examples to inſtruct you: but we are often convinced of our miſtake, without being cured of our paſſion. Reckon up, if poſſible, the evils that flow from love: it impoſes on the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; it fills the ſoul and the ſenſes with trouble; it takes away the flower of innocence; it ſtuns virtue; it blaſts the reputation, ſhame being almoſt always the conſequence of love. Nothing debaſes you to ſuch a degree, and ſinks you ſo much below your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as the paſſions. They degrade you: there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but reaſon that can maintain your dignity. It is far more unhappy to ſtand in need of one's cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to bear a misfortune, than to avoid it. The pleaſure of doing one's duty is a comfort to you; but never applaud yourſelf, for fear of being hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled. Remember, that you carry your enemy about with you; adhere ſtrictly to a conduct that may anſwer for you to yourſelf. Avoid plays and paſſionate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations; you muſt not ſee what you would not feel; muſic, poetry, all this is of the retinue of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual pleaſure. Uſe yourſelf to reading on ſolid ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, to fortify your reaſon.</p>
            <p>Do not converſe with your imagination. It will
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:024452_0196_0FC739CA54056590"/>
paint love to you with all its charms. It is all ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction and illuſion, when ſhe makes the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: there is always a great drawback, when you quit her to come to the reality. St. Auguſtine has given us a deſcription of his condition, when he was inclined to quit love and pleaſures. He ſays, that what he loved, preſented itſelf to him under a charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing figure: he repreſents what paſſed in his heart in ſuch moving terms, that there is no reading it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger. One muſt paſs ſlightly over the pictures of pleaſure; ſhe is always to be feared, even at the very time we are taking meaſures againſt her; and when we are fulleſt of the diſaſters ſhe has occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we are ſtill to miſtruſt ourſelves. The paſſion is apt to get ground by the examining of one's ſelf; forgetfulneſs is the only ſecurity to be taken againſt love. You muſt call yourſelf ſeriouſly to account, and ſay,
<q>What do I mean to do with the inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that is ſeizing me? Are not ſuch and ſuch miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes ſure to attend me, if I have the weakneſs to yield to it?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Borrow forces and ſuccour from your enemy and the very nature of love. If you would not flatter him, he will ſupply you with them. Strip him of all the charms that your fancy gives him; lend him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; give him no favour; and you will ſee he will have but little left.—After this, think no more of him; take a firm reſolution to fly from him; and depend-upon it, we are as ſtrong as we reſolve to be. Diverſion and ſimple amuſements are neceſſary; but we muſt ſhun all pleaſures that affect the heart.</p>
            <p>It is not always our faults that ruin us, but the manner of our conduct, after we have committed them. An humble acknowledgment of our faults diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arms reſentment, and ſtops the violence of anger. Women that have had the misfortune to deviate from their duty, to break through decorum, to part with their virtue and modeſty, owe ſo much regard to cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and ought to have ſuch a ſenſe of their breach of chaſtity, as to appear with a mortified air. It is a ſort of ſatisfaction that the public expect from
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:024452_0197_0FC739CE620EE328"/>
them; they are ſure to remember your faults, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you appear to forget them. Repentance inſures a change of your conduct; prevent the malignity which is natural to mankind; put yourſelf in the place that their pride allots you; they would have you humbled; and when you have made yourſelf ſo to their hands, they will have no more to ſay to you: but ſhe that is proud after committing faults, calls them to mind, and makes them immortal.</p>
            <p>Let us now paſs, my daughter, to the ſocial duties. I thought I was in the firſt place to draw you out of the common education and the prejudices of child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and that it was neceſſary to fortify your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and give you ſome ſolid principles to ſupport you. I thought moſt of the diſorders of life were owing to falſe opinions; that falſe opinions produced looſe ſentiments; and that when the underſtanding is not enlightened, the heart is expoſed to paſſions; that there muſt be ſome truths fixed in the mind to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve us from error; and that one muſt have ſome ſentiments in the heart to keep out the paſſions. When you have once a knowledge of truth, and a love for juſtice, there is no danger of all the other virtues.</p>
            <p>The firſt duty of civil life is to take care of others; ſuch as live only for themſelves, fall into contempt, and are neglected by every body. If you require too much from others, they will refuſe you every thing, their friendſhip, their affections, and their ſervices. Civil life is a mutual intercourſe of good offices: the moſt valuable part of mankind go ſtill further: by promoting the happineſs of others, you inſure your own; 'tis the trueſt politics to think in this manner.</p>
            <p>Nothing can be more odious than people that make every body ſee that they live only for themſelves. An extravagant ſelf-love is the ſource of great crimes; ſome degrees lower it occaſions vices: but let there be ever ſo little a ſpice of it in a perſon, it impairs all the virtues and charms of ſociety.</p>
            <p>'Tis impoſſible to make a friendſhip with perſons who have a predominant ſelf-love, and take care to ſhow it: and yet we can nver ſtrip ourſelves of it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely;
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:024452_0198_0FC739D1608C65C0"/>
as long as we are attached to life, we ſhall be attached to ourſelves.</p>
            <p>But there is a qualified ſelf-love that is not exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed at the expenſe of others.</p>
            <p>We fancy we exalt ourſelves by depreſſing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> equals: this makes us cenſorious and envious. Good<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y. Do good when it is in your power; ſpeak well of all the world, and never judge with rigour. Such acts of goodneſs and generoſity, frequently repeated, will gain you at leaſt a great and excellent reputation. All the world is engaged to commend you, to extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate your defects, and enhance your good qualities. You ſhould found your reputation upon your own vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and not upon the demerit of others: conſider that their good qualities take nothing at all from you, and that the diminution of your reputation can be imputed to no body but yourſelf.</p>
            <p>One of the things that contributes moſt to make us unhappy, is, that we depend too much upon the men; 'tis the ſource too of our injuſtice. We pick quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels with them, not on account of what they owe us, or of what they have promiſed us, but on account of what we have hoped from them. We depend abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely upon our hopes, which occaſion us abundance of diſappointments.</p>
            <p>Be not raſh in your judgments and give no ear to calumnies: never give in to the firſt appearance of things, nor be in haſte to condemn any body. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that there are things probable which are not true, as there are things true, which are not probable.</p>
            <p>We ſhould, in our private judgments, imitate the equity of ſolemn judgments. Judges never decide without having examined, heard, and confronted the witneſſes with the parties concerned. But we, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any commiſſion, ſet up for umpires of reputation: and every proof is ſufficient, every authority appears good, when the buſineſs is to condemn. Prompted by our natural malignity, we fancy that we give our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves what we take away from others: hence ariſe
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:024452_0199_0FC739D28ADC0B68"/>
animoſities and enmities; for every thing is ſure to be known.</p>
            <p>Be equitable, therefore, in your judgments; the ſame juſtice that you do to others, they will return to you. Would you have them think and ſpeak well of you, never ſpeak ill of any body.</p>
            <p>Civility, which is an imitation of charity, is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the ſocial virtues: it puts you above others, when you have it in a more eminent degree; but it is practiſed and maintained at the expenſe of ſelf-love. Civility is always borrowing ſomething from your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and turning it to the advantage of others. 'Tis one of the great bonds of ſociety, and the only quality that makes one ſafe and eaſy in the intercourſe of life.</p>
            <p>We naturally love to govern; 'tis an unjuſt incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Whence have we our right to pretend to exalt ourſelves above others? There is but one juſt and allowable ſuperiority; 'tis that which virtue gives you; have more goodneſs and generoſity than others: be beforehand with them, more in ſervices than bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits; 'tis the way to raiſe yourſelf. A great diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſtedneſs makes you as independent, and raiſes you higher than the ampleſt fortune: nothing ſinks us ſo much, as a fondneſs for our own intereſt.</p>
            <p>The qualities of the heart have the greateſt concern in the commerce of life. The underſtanding does not endear us to others; and you frequently ſee men very odious with great parts; they are for giving you a good opinion of themſelves; they are for getting an aſcendant over and depreſſing others.</p>
            <p>Though humility has only been conſidered as a chriſtian virtue, it muſt be owned to be a ſocial virtue; and ſo neceſſary a one, that without it, 'tis a very tickliſh matter to have to do with you. 'Tis the conceit that you have of yourſelf, which makes you maintain your rights with ſo much arrogance, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench on thoſe of other people.</p>
            <p>We muſt never be ſtrict in calling any body to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. Exact civility does not inſiſt on all that is due to you. Do not be afraid of being before-hand
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:024452_0200_0FC739D643060858"/>
with your friends: if you have a mind to be a true friend, never inſiſt on any thing too ſtiffly; but that your behaviour may not be inconſiſtent, as it expreſſes your inward diſpoſition, make often ſerious reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on your weakneſſes, and take yourſelf to pieces. This examination will make you entertain ſentiments of humility for yourſelf, and of indulgence with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to others.</p>
            <p>Be humble without being baſhful. Shame is a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret pride; and pride is an error with regard to one's own worth, and an injuſtice with regard to what one has a mind to appear to others.</p>
            <p>Reputation is an advantage very deſirable; but it is a weakneſs to court it with too much ardour, and do nothing but with a view to it. We ought to content ourſelves with deſerving it. We ſhould not diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age ſenſibility for glory; 'tis the ſureſt help we have to virtue; but the buſineſs is to make choice of true glory.</p>
            <p>Accuſtom yourſelf to ſee what is above you without either admiration or envy; and what is below you without contempt. Do not let the pomp of greatneſs impoſe on you. None but little ſouls fall down and worſhip grandeur. Admiration is only due to virtue.</p>
            <p>To uſe yourſelf to value men by their proper qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, conſider the condition of a perſon loaded with honours, dignities, and riches, who ſeems to want nothing at all, but really wants every thing, by being deſtitute of true goods, of thoſe internal qualities that are neceſſary to the enjoyment and uſe of them. He ſuffers as much as if his poverty was real, ſo long as he has the ſenſe of poverty, and is wiſhing for more. "There is nothing worſe," ſays one of the ancients,
<q>than poverty in the midſt of riches, becauſe the evil lies in the mind.</q>
The man that is in this ſituation, feels all the evils of opinion, without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the goods of fortune. He is blinded by error, and tormented by his paſſions: while a reaſonable perſon, who has nothing at all, but ſubſtitutes wiſe and ſolid reflexions to ſupply the place of riches and
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:024452_0201_0FC739D7C0A89C10"/>
honours, enjoys a tranquillity which nothing can equal. The happineſs of the one, and the miſery of the other, come only from their different manner of thinking.</p>
            <p>If you find yourſelf diſpoſed to reſentment and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, ſtrive to keep down that ſentiment; there is nothing ſo mean as to revenge one's ſelf. If you meet with ill-treatment from any body, you owe them only contempt; 'tis a debt eaſy to be paid. If they have offended you only in ſlight matters, you owe them indulgence: but there are certain ſeaſons in life, when you muſt meet with injuries—ſeaſons when the friends for whom you have done moſt, fall foul upon and condemn you: in ſuch a caſe, after having done all you can, to undeceive them, do not be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate in diſputing with them. One ought to court the eſteem of one's friends: but when you find peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that will only view you through their prejudices<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when you have diſputes with ſuch hot and fiery ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations as will admit of nothing but what favours their injuſtice, you have nothing to do but retire and ſet your heart at reſt. Do what you will, you'll get nothing from them but diſcontent. When you thus ſuffer from their ill-uſage and ſhame of recanting, comfort yourſelf in your innocence, and the aſſurance that you have not offended. Think, that if your worth was not greater at the time they raiſed you, it is not at all leſs now they are for cruſhing you: you ſhould, without being more mortified at it, pity them, and not be exaſperated, if poſſible, but ſay,
<q>They ſee in a wrong light.</q>
Conſider that with good qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities one may at leaſt get over reſentment and envy. Let the hopes you draw from virtue, keep up your courage, and be your conſolation.</p>
            <p>Do not think of revenging yourſelf any way but by uſing more moderation in your conduct, than thoſe that attack you, have malice. None but ſublime ſouls are touched with the glory of pardoning injuries.</p>
            <p>Set yourſelf to deſerve your own eſteem, the better to conſole yourſelf for the eſteem which others deny you. You can allow yourſelf but one ſort of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance;
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:024452_0202_0FC739DA0656AA58"/>
'tis that of doing good to ſuch as have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended you: 'tis the moſt exquiſite revenge, and the only one that is allowable. You gratify your paſſion, and you intrench upon no virtue. Ceſar has ſet us an example of it. His lieutenant Labienus deſerted from him at a time that he ſtood in moſt need of him, and went over to Pompey, leaving great riches in Ceſar's camp. Ceſar ſent them after him, with a meſſage to tell him,
<q>that was the manner of Ceſar's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.</q>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis prudent to make a good uſe of other people's faults, even when they do us miſchief; but very often they only begin the wrongs, and we finiſh them; they give us indeed a right againſt themſelves, but we make an ill uſe of it: we are for taking too much advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of their faults. This is an injuſtice and a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence that makes the ſtanders-by againſt us. If we ſuffered with moderation, all the world would be for us, and the faults of thoſe that attack us, would be doubled by our patience.</p>
            <p>When you know that your friends have not treated you as they ought, take no notice of it. As ſoon as ever you ſhow that you perceive it, their malignity increaſes, and you give a looſe to their hatred: whereas by diſſembling it, you flatter their ſelf-love; they enjoy the pleaſure of impoſing on you; they fancy themſelves your ſuperiors, as long as they are not diſcovered; they triumph in your miſtake, and feel another pleaſure in not ruining you quite. By not letting them ſee that you know them, you give them time to repent and come to themſelves; and there needs nothing but a ſeaſonable piece of ſervice, and a different manner of taking things, to make them more attached to you than ever.</p>
            <p>Be inviolable in your word. But to gain it an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire confidence, remember that you muſt be extremely ſcrupulous in keeping it. Show your regard to truth even in things indifferent; and conſider that there is nothing ſo deſpicable as to deviate from it. 'Tis a common ſaying, that lying ſhows that people deſpiſe God, and ſtand in fear of man; and that the man
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:024452_0203_0FC739E05D96A948"/>
who ſpeaks truth, and does good, reſembles the Diety. We ſhould likewiſe avoid ſwearing; the bare word of an honeſt perſon ſhould have all the credit and authority of an oath.</p>
            <p>Politeneſs is a deſire of pleaſing: nature gives it, education and the world improve it. Politeneſs is a ſupplement to virtue. They ſay it came into the world, when that daughter of heaven abandoned it. In ruder times, when virtue bore a greater ſway, they knew leſs of politeneſs: it came in with volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſs; it is the daughter of luxury and delicacy. It has been diſputed, whether it approaches neareſt to vice or virtue. Without pretending to decide the queſtion, or define politeneſs: may I be allowed to ſpeak my ſentiments of it? I take it to be one of the greateſt bonds of ſociety, as it contributes moſt to the peace of it; 'tis a preparation to charity, and an imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, too, of humility. True politeneſs is modeſt; and, as it aims to pleaſe, it knows that the way to carry its point, is to ſhow that we do not prefer ourſelves to others, but give them the firſt rank in our eſteem.</p>
            <p>Pride keeps us off from ſociety: our ſelf-love gives us a peculiar rank, which is always diſputed with us. Such a high eſteem of ourſelves, as makes others feel it, is almoſt always puniſhed with an univerſal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. Politeneſs is the art of reconciling agreeably what we owe to others, and what one owes to one's ſelf; for theſe duties have their bounds, which when they exceed, 'tis flattery with regard to others, and pride with regard to yourſelf. It is the moſt ſeduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quality in nature.</p>
            <p>The moſt polite perſons have generally a good deal of ſweetneſs in their converſation, and engaging qualities: 'tis the girdle of Venus; it ſets off, and gives graces and charms to all that wear it; and with it, you cannot fail to pleaſe.</p>
            <p>There are ſeveral degrees of politeneſs. You carry it to a higher point in proportion to the delicacy of your way of thinking. It diſtinguiſhes itſelf in all your behaviour, in your converſation, and even in your ſilence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="208" facs="unknown:024452_0204_0FC739E26709E580"/>Perfect politeneſs forbids us to diſplay our parts and talents with aſſurance; it even borders upon cruelty, to ſhow one's ſelf happy when we have cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain misfortunes before our eyes. Converſation in the world is enough to poliſh our outward behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; but there muſt be a good deal of delicacy to form a politeneſs of mind. A nice politeneſs, formed with art and taſte, will make the world excuſe you a great many failings, and improve your good qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities. Such as are defective in point of behaviour, have the greater need of ſolid qualities, and make ſlower advances in gaining a reputation. In a word, politeneſs coſts but little, and is of vaſt advantage.</p>
            <p>Silence always becomes a young perſon. There is a modeſty and dignity in keeping it; you ſit in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon others, and run no hazard yourſelf. But guard yourſelf againſt a proud and inſulting ſilence; it ſhould be the reſult of your prudence, and not the conſequence of your pride. But as there is no hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our peace always, it is fit for us to know, that the principal rule for ſpeaking well, is to think well.</p>
            <p>When your notions are clear and diſtinct, your diſcourſe will be ſo too; let a proper decorum and modeſty run through it. In all your diſcourſes, pay a regard to received cuſtoms and prejudices. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions declare the ſentiments of the heart, and the ſentiments form the behaviour.</p>
            <p>Be particularly careful not to ſet up for a joker; 'tis an ill part to act; and by making others laugh, we ſeldom make ourſelves eſteemed. Pay a great deal more attention to others, than to yourſelf, and think how to ſet them out, rather than to ſhine your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. We ſhould learn how to liſten to other people's diſcourſe, and not betray an abſence of mind either by our eyes or our manner. Never dwell upon ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. If you chance to tell any, do it in a genteel and cloſe manner; let what you ſay be new, or at leaſt give it a new turn. The world is full of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that are dinning things into your ears, without ſaying any thing to entertain the mind. Whenever we ſpeak, we ſhould take care either to pleaſe or
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:024452_0205_0FC739E6413C2980"/>
inſtruct. When you call for the attention of the company, you ſhould make them amends by the agr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of what you ſay. An indifferent diſcourſe cannot be too ſhort.</p>
            <p>You may approve what you hear; but ſhould very ſeldom admire it: admiration is proper to blockheads. Never let your diſcourſe have an air of art and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; the greateſt prudence lies in ſpeaking little, and ſhowing more diffidence of one's ſelf, than of other people. An upright conduct, and a reputation for probity, gains more confidence and eſteem, and, at the long-run, more advantages, too, in point of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, than any by-ways. Nothing makes you ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the greateſt matters, and raiſes you ſo much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bove others, as an exact probity.</p>
            <p>Uſe yourſelf to treat your ſervants with kindneſs and humanity. 'Tis a ſaying of one of the ancients, "that we ought to conſider them as unhappy friends." Remember that the vaſt difference between you and them, is owing merely to chance—never make them uneaſy in their ſtate of life, or add weight to the trouble of it. There is nothing ſo poor and mean as to be haughty to any body that is in your ſervice.</p>
            <p>Never uſe any harſh language. It ſhould never come out of the mouth of a delicate and polite per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Servitude being ſettled in oppoſition to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural equality of mankind, it behoves us to ſoften it. What right have we to expect our ſervants ſhould be without faults, when we give them inſtances every day of our own? Let us rather bear with them. When you ſhow yourſelf in all your humours and fits of paſſion (for we often lay ourſelves open before our ſervants) how do you expoſe yourſelf to them? (an you have any right afterwards to reprimand them? A mean familiarity with them is indeed ever to be avoided; but you owe them aſſiſtance, advice, and bounties ſuitable to their condition and wants.</p>
            <p>One ſhould keep up authority in one's family; but it ſhould be a mild authority. We ſhould not indeed always threaten without puniſhing, for fear of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our threats into contempt: but we ſhould not
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:024452_0206_0FC739E83A8907F8"/>
call in authority, till perſuaſion has failed. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that humanity and chriſtianity put all the world on the ſame foot. The impatience and heat of youth, joined to the falſe notion they give you of yourſelf, make you look upon your ſervants as crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of a different ſpecies; but how contrary are ſuch ſentiments to the modeſty that you owe to your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and the humanity you owe to others!</p>
            <p>Never reliſh or encourage the flattery of ſervants; and to prevent the impreſſion which their fawning ſpeeches, frequently repeated, may make upon you, conſider that they are hirelings paid to ſerve your weakneſſes and pride.</p>
            <p>If by misfortune, daughter, you ſhould not think fit to follow my advice and precepts, though they be loſt upon you, they will ſtill be uſeful to myſelf, as laying me under new obligations. Theſe reflexions are freſh engagements to me to exert myſelf in the way of virtue. I fortify my reaſon even againſt my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; for I am now under a neceſſity of following it, or elſe I expoſe myſelf to the ſhame of having known it, and yet been falſe to it.</p>
            <p>There is nothing, my daughter, more mortifying than to write upon ſubjects that put me in mind of all my faults. By laying them open to you, I give up my right to reprimand you; I furniſh you with arms againſt myſelf. And I allow you freely to uſe them, if you ſee any vices in me inconſiſtent with the virtues that I recommend to you; for all advice and precepts want authority, when they are not ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by example.</p>

            <head>THE LADIES' LIBRARY. Letter on the Government of the Temper. To a young Lady.</head>
            <byline>By Mrs. Chapone.</byline>
            <p>A great Point of Importance to your future happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, my dear, is what your parents have, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, been continually attentive to from your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, as it is impoſſible to undertake it too early— I mean the due regulation of your temper. Though you are in a great meaſure indebted to their forming hands for whatever is good in it, you are ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, no doubt, as every human creature is, of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſities to ſome infirmity of temper, which it muſt now be <hi>your own</hi> care to correct and to ſubdue; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the pains that have hitherto been taken with you, may all become fruitleſs: and, when you are your own miſtreſs, you may relapſe into thoſe faults, which were originally in your nature, and which will require to be diligently watched and kept under, through the whole courſe of your life.</p>
            <p>If you conſider, that the conſtant tenor of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel precepts is to promote love, peace, and good-will among men, you will not doubt that the cultivation of an amiable diſpoſition is a great part of your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious duty; ſince nothing leads more directly to the breach of charity, and to the injury and moleſtation
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:024452_0208_0FC739EFF759A5B0"/>
of our fellow-creatures, than the indulgence of an ill temper. Do not, therefore, think lightly of the offences you may commit, for want of a due command over it, or ſuppoſe yourſelf reſponſible for them to your fellow-creatures only; but be aſſured, you muſt give a ſtrict account of them all to the Supreme Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of the world, who has made this a great part of your appointed trial upon earth.</p>
            <p>A woman, bred up in a religious manner, placed above the reach of want, and out of the way of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and ſcandalous vices, can have but few tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the flagrant breach of the divine laws. It particularly concerns her, therefore, to underſtand them in their full import, and to conſider, how far ſhe treſpaſſes againſt them, by ſuch actions as appear trivial, when compared with murder, adultery, and theft, but which become of very great importance, by being frequently repeated, and occurring in the daily tranſactions of life.</p>
            <p>The principal virtues or vices of a woman muſt be of a private and domeſtic kind. Within the circle of her own family and dependants lies her ſphere of action—the ſcene of almoſt all thoſe taſks and trials, which muſt determine her character, and her fate here, and hereafter. Reflect for a moment, how much the happineſs of her huſband, children, and ſervants, muſt depend on her temper; and you will ſee that the greateſt good, or evil, which ſhe ever may have in her power to do, may riſe from her cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting or indulging its infirmities.</p>
            <p>Though I wiſh the principle of duty towards God to be your ruling motive in the exerciſe of every virtue, yet, as human nature ſtands in need of all poſſible helps, let us not forget how eſſential it is to preſent happineſs, and to the enjoyment of this life, to cultivate ſuch a temper as is likewiſe indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly requiſite to the attainment of higher felicity in the life to come. The greateſt outward bleſſings can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not afford enjoyment to a mind ruffled and uneaſy within itſelf. A fit of ill-humour will ſpoil the fineſt entertainment, and is as real a torment as the
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:024452_0209_0FC739F3E37197D8"/>
moſt painful diſeaſe. Another unavoidable conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of ill-temper is the diſlike and averſion of all who are witneſſes to it, and, perhaps, the deep and laſting reſentment of thoſe, who ſuffer from its effects. We all, from ſocial or ſelf-love, earneſtly deſire the eſteem and affection of our fellow-creatures; and indeed our condition makes them ſo neceſſary to us, that the wretch, who has forfeited them, muſt feel deſolate and undone, deprived of all the beſt enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and comforts the world can afford, and given up to his inward miſery, unpitied and ſcorned. But this can never be the fate of a good-natured perſon: whatever faults he may have, they will generally be treated with lenity; he will find an advocate in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry humane heart; his errors will be lamented ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than abhorred; and his virtues will be viewed in the faireſt point of light: his good-humour, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of great talents or acquirements, will make his company preferable to that of the moſt bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant genius, in whom this quality is wanting: in ſhort, it is almoſt impoſſible that you can be ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloved by any body, without this engaging pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, whatever other excellencies you may poſſeſs: but, with it, you will ſcarcely fail of finding ſome friends and favourers, even though you ſhould be deſtitute of almoſt every other advantage.</p>
            <p>Perhaps you will ſay,
<q>all this is very true, but our tempers are not in our own power—we are made with different diſpoſitions, and, if mine is not not amiable, it is rather my unhappineſs than my fault.</q>
This, my dear, is commonly ſaid by thoſe who will not take the trouble to correct themſelves. Yet be aſſured, it it a deluſion, and will not avail in our juſtification before him.
<q>who knoweth where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we are made,</q>
and of what we are capable. it is true, we are not all equally happy in our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions: but human virtue conſiſts in cheriſhing and cultivating every good inclination, and in check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſubduing every propenſity to evil. If you had been born with a bad temper, it might have been made a good one, at leaſt with regard to its
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:024452_0210_0FC739F5C3901C00"/>
outward effects, by education, reaſon, and principle: and, though you are ſo happy as to have a good one while young, do not ſuppoſe it will always continue ſo, if you neglect to maintain a proper command over it. Power, ſickneſs, diſappointments or world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cares, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ay corrupt and embitter the fineſt diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if they are not counteracted by reaſon and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>It is obſerved, that every temper is inclined, in ſome degree, either to paſſion, peeviſhneſs, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy. Many are ſo unfortunate as to be inclined to each of the three in turn: it is neceſſary, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to watch the bent of our nature, and to apply the remedies proper for the infirmity to which we are moſt liable. With regard to the firſt, it is ſo injurious to ſociety, and ſo odious in itſelf, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the female character, that one would think ſhame alone would be ſufficient to preſerve a young woman from giving way to it; for it is as unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her character to be betrayed into ill behaviour by <hi>paſſion</hi> as by <hi>intoxication</hi>; and ſhe ought to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of the one, as much as of the other. Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, meekneſs, and patience, are her peculiar diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctions; and an enraged woman is one of the moſt diſguſting ſights in nature.</p>
            <p>It is plain, from experience, that the moſt paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate people can command themſelves, when they have a motive ſufficiently ſtrong—ſuch as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of thoſe they fear, or to whom they particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly deſire to recommend themſelves: it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no excuſe to perſons, whom you have injured by unkind reproaches, and unjuſt aſperſions, to tell them you were in a paſſion: the allowing yourſelf to ſpeak to them in a paſſion, is a proof of an inſolent diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, which the meaneſt of your fellow-creatures would have a right to reſent. When once you find yourſelf heated ſo far as to deſire to ſay what you know would be provoking and wounding to another, you ſhould immediately reſolve either to be ſilent, or to quit the room, rather than give utterance to any thing dictated by ſo bad an inclination. Be aſſured,
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:024452_0211_0FC739F73640E698"/>
you are then unfit to reaſon or to reprove, or to hear reaſon from others. It is therefore your part to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire from ſuch an occaſion of ſin; and wait till you are cool, before you preſume to judge of what has paſſed. By accuſtoming yourſelf thus to conquer and diſappoint your anger, you will by degrees, find it grow weak and manageable, ſo as to leave your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at liberty. You will be able to reſtrain your tongue from evil, and your looks and geſtures from all expreſſions of violence and ill-will. Pride, which produces ſo many evils in the human mind, is the great ſource of paſſion. Whoever cultivates in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a proper humility, a due ſenſe of his own faults and inſufficiencies, and a due reſpect for others, will find but ſmall temptation to violent or unreaſonable anger.</p>
            <p>In the caſe of real injuries, which juſtify and call for reſentment, there is a noble and generous kind of anger, a proper and neceſſary part of our nature, which has nothing in it ſinful or degrading. I would not wiſh you inſenſible to this; for the perſon, who feels not an injury, muſt be incapable of being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly affected by benefits. With thoſe, who treat you ill without provocation, you ought to maintain your own dignity. But, in order to do this, while you ſhow a ſenſe of their improper behaviour, you muſt preſerve calmneſs and even good-breeding—and thereby convince them of the impotence, as well as injuſtice of their malice. You muſt alſo weigh every circumſtance with candour and charity, and conſider whether your ſhowing the reſentment deſerved, may not produce ill conſequences to innocent perſons—as is almoſt always the caſe in family quarrels—and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it may not occaſion the breach of ſome duty, or neceſſary connexion, to which you ought to ſacrifice even your juſt reſentments. Above all things, take care that a particular offence to you does not make you unjuſt to the general character of the offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſon. Generous anger does not preclude eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem for what is really eſtimable, nor does it deſtroy good will to the perſon of its object: it even inſpires
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:024452_0212_0FC73A007153BF20"/>
the deſire of overcoming him by benefits, and wiſhes to inflict no other puniſhment than the regret of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing injured one, who deſerved his kindneſs: it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways placable, and ready to be reconciled, as ſoon as the offender is convinced of his error; nor can any ſubſequent injury provoke it to recur to paſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obligations, which had been once forgiven. But it is perhaps unneceſſary to give rules for this caſe.— The conſciouſneſs of injured innocence naturally produces dignity, and uſually prevents exceſs of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Our paſſion is moſt unruly, when we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of blame, and when we apprehend that we have laid ourſelves open to contempt. Where we know we have been wrong, the leaſt injuſtice in the degree of blame imputed to us, excites our bittereſt reſentment; but, where we know ourſelves fault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, the ſharpeſt accuſation excites pity or contempt, rather than rage. Whenever therefore you feel yourſelf very angry, ſuſpect yourſelf to be in the wrong, and reſolve to ſtand the deciſion of your own conſcience before you caſt upon another the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is perhaps due to yourſelf. This ſelf-examination will at leaſt give you time to cool, and, if you are juſt, will diſpoſe you to balance your own wrong with that of your antagoniſt, and to ſettle the account with him on equal terms.</p>
            <p>Peeveſhneſs, though not ſo violent and fatal in its immediate effects, is ſtill more unamiable than paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and, if poſſible, more deſtructive of happineſs, in as much as it operates more continually. Though the fretful man injures us leſs, he diſguſts us more than the paſſionate one— becauſe he betrays a low and little mind, intent on trifles, and engroſſed by paltry ſelf-love, which knows not how to bear the very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of any inconvenience. It is ſelf-love then, which we muſt combat, when we find ourſelves aſſaulted by this infirmity; and by voluntarily endur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inconveniencies, we ſhall habituate ourſelves to bear them with eaſe, and good humour, when occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by others. Perhaps this is the beſt kind of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious mortification, as the chief end of denying our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:024452_0213_0FC73A01C6A8E138"/>
any innocent indulgences muſt be to acquire a habit of command over our paſſions and inclinations, particularly ſuch as are likely to lead us into evil. Another method of conquering this enemy is to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract our minds from that attention to trifling cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, which uſually creates this uneaſineſs. Thoſe who are engaged in high and important pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits are very little affected by ſmall inconveniences. The man whoſe head is full of ſtudious thought or whoſe heart is full of care, will eat his dinner with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing whether it was well or ill dreſſed, or whether it was ſerved punctually at the hour or not: and though abſence from the common things of life is far from deſirable—eſpecially in a woman—yet too minute and anxious an attention to them ſeldom fails to produce a teazing, mean, and fretful diſpoſition. I would therefore wiſh your mind to have always ſome objects in purſuit worthy of it; that it may not be engroſſed by ſuch as are in themſelves ſcarce worth a moment's anxiety. It is chiefly in the decline of life, when amuſements fail, and when the more importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate paſſions ſubſide, that this infirmity is obſerved to grow upon us—and perhaps it will ſeldom fail to do ſo, unleſs carefully watched and counteracted by reaſon. We muſt then endeavour to ſubſtitute ſome purſuits in the place of thoſe, which can only engage <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s in the beginning of our courſe. The purſuit of glory and happineſs in another life, by every means of improving and exalting our own minds, becomes more and more intereſting to us, the nearer we draw to the end of all ſublunary enjoyments. Reading, reflexion, rational converſation, and, above all, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with God, by prayer and meditation, may preſerve us from taking that anxious intereſt in the little comforts and conveniencies of our remaining days, which uſually gives birth to ſo much fretfulneſs in old people. But though the aged and infirm are moſt liable to this evil—and they alone are to be pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied for it—yet we ſometimes ſee the young, the healthy, and thoſe who enjoy moſt outward bleſſings, inexcuſably guilty of it. The ſmalleſt diſappointment
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:024452_0214_0FC73A033AC2ADC8"/>
in pleaſure, or difficulty in the moſt trifling employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will put wilful young people out of temper, and their very amuſements frequently become ſources of vexation and peeviſhneſs. How often have I ſeen a girl, preparing for a ball, or for ſome other public appearance—unable to ſatisfy her own vanity—fret over every ornament ſhe put on, quarrel with her maid, with her clothes, her hair; and growing ſtill more unlovely as ſhe grew more croſs, be ready to fight with her looking-glaſs, for not making her as handſome as ſhe wiſhed to be! She did not conſider that the traces of this ill-humour on her countenance would be a greater diſadvantage to her appearance than any defect in her dreſs—or even than the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt features enlivened by joy and good-humour. There is a degree of reſignation neceſſary even to the enjoyment of pleaſure; we muſt be ready and willing to give up ſome part of what we could wiſh for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can enjoy that which is indulged to us. I have no doubt that ſhe, who frets all the while ſhe is dreſſing for an aſſembly, will ſuffer ſtill greater un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs when ſhe is there. The ſame craving, reſtleſs vanity will there endure a thouſand mortifications, which in the midſt of ſeeming pleaſure, will ſecretly corrode her heart; whilſt the meek and humble ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally find more gratification than they expected, and return home pleaſed and enlivened from every ſcene of amuſement, though they could have ſtaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from it with perfect eaſe and contentment.</p>
            <p>Sullenneſs, or obſtinacy, is perhaps a worſe fault of temper than either of the former—and, if indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, may end in the moſt fatal extremes of ſtubborn melancholy, malice and revenge. The reſentment which, inſtead of being expreſſed, is nurſed in ſecret, and continually aggravated by the imagination, will, in time, become the ruling paſſion; and then, how horrible muſt be his caſe, whoſe kind and pleaſurable affections are all ſwallowed up by the tormenting as well as deteſtable ſentiments of hatred and revenge? —

—Brood not over a reſentment which perhaps was at firſt ill grounded, and which is undoubtedly heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened by an heated imagination. But, when you have firſt ſubdued your own temper, ſo as to be able to ſpeak calmly, reaſonably, and kindly, then expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late with the perſon you ſuppoſe to be in fault—hear what ſhe has to ſay; and either reconcile yourſelf to her, or quiet your mind under the injury, by the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of chriſtian charity. But if it ſhould appear that you yourſelf have been moſt to blame, or if you have been in an error, acknowledge it fairly and handſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: if you feel any reluctance to do ſo, be certain that it ariſes from pride, to conquer which is an abſolute duty—"A ſoft anſwer turneth away wrath:" and a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous confeſſion oftentimes more than atones for the fault which requires it. Truth and juſtice demand that we ſhould acknowledge conviction, as ſoon as we feel it, and not maintain an erroneous opinion, or juſtify a wrong conduct, merely for the falſe ſhame of confeſſing our paſt ignorance. A falſe ſhame it undoubtedly is, and as impolitic as unjuſt; ſince your error is already ſeen by thoſe who endeavour to ſet you right: but your conviction, and the candour and generoſity of owning it freely, may ſtill be an honour to you, and would greatly recommend you to the perſon with whom you diſputed. With a diſpoſition ſtrongly inclined to ſullenneſs or obſtinacy, this muſt be a very painful exertion; and to make a perfect conqueſt over yourſelf may at once perhaps appear impracticable, while the zeal of ſelf juſtification, and the abhorrence of blame, are ſtrong upon you. But, if you are ſo unhappy as to yield to your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, at one time, do not let this diſcourage you from renewing your efforts. Your mind will gain ſtrength from the conteſt; and your internal enemy will by degrees be forced to give ground. Be not afraid to revive the ſubject, as ſoon as you find yourſelf able to ſubdue your temper; and then frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:024452_0216_0FC73A06F67BBD18"/>
lay open the conflict you ſuſtained at the time; by this you will make all the amends in your power for your fault, and will certainly change the diſguſt you have given into pity at leaſt, if not admiration. Nothing is more endearing than ſuch a confeſſion:— and you will find ſuch a ſatisfaction in your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs, and in the renewed tenderneſs and eſteem you will gain from the perſon concerned, that your taſk for the future will be made more eaſy, and your reluctance to be convinced, will on every occaſion grow leſs and leſs.</p>
            <p>The love of truth, and a real deſire of improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ought to be the only motives of argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and, where theſe are ſincere, no difficulty can be made of embracing the truth, as ſoon as it is perceived. But, in fact, people oftener diſpute from vanity and pride, which make it a grievous mort<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>fication to allow that we are the wiſer for what we have heard from another. To receive advice, reproof, and inſtruction, properly, is the ſureſt ſign of a ſincere and humble heart—and ſhows a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind, which commands our reſpect and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, while it appears ſo willingly to yield to us the ſuperiority.</p>
            <p>Obſerve, notwithſtanding, that I do not wiſh you to hear of your faults without pain: ſuch an indifference would afford ſmall hopes of amendment. Shame and remorſe are the firſt ſteps to true repentance; yet we ſhould be willing to bear this pain, and thankful to the kind hand that inflicts it for our good. Nor muſt we, by ſullen ſilence under it, leave our kind phyſician in doubt, whether the operation has taken effect or not, or whether it has not added another malady, inſtead of curing the firſt. You muſt conſider, that thoſe who tell you of your faults, if they do it from motives of kindneſs and not of malice, exert their friendſhip in a painful office, which muſt have coſt them as great an effort as it can be to you to acknowledge the ſervice; and, if you refuſe this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, you cannot expect that any one, who is not abſolutely obliged to it by duty, will a ſecond

time undertake ſuch an ill-requited trouble. What a loſs would this be to yourſelf!—how difficult would be our progreſs to that degree of perfection, which is neceſſary to our happineſs, was it not for the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance we receive from each other!—this certainly is one of the means of grace held out to us by our merciful judge, and, if we reject it, we are anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for all the miſcarriages we may fall into for want of it.</p>
            <p>I know not, whether that ſtrange caprice, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality of taſte and behaviour, ſo commonly attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to our ſex, may be properly called a fault of temper—as it ſeems not to be connected with, or ariſing from our animal frame, but to be rather the fruit of our own ſelf-indulgence, degenerating by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees into ſuch a wantonneſs of will as knows not how to pleaſe itſelf. When, inſtead of regulating our actions by reaſon and principle, we ſuffer our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be guided by every ſlight and momentary impulſe of inclination, we ſhall, doubtleſs, appear ſo variable and inconſtant, that nobody can gueſs, by our behaviour to-day, what may be expected from us to-morrow; nor can we ourſelves tell whether what we delighted in a week ago, will now afford us the leaſt degree of pleaſure. It is in vain for others to attempt to pleaſe us—we cannot pleaſe ourſelves, though all we could wiſh for waits our choice: and thus does a capricious woman become
<q>ſick of her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, through very ſelfiſhneſs:</q>
And, when this is the caſe, it is eaſy to judge how ſick others muſt be of her, and how contemptible and diſguſting ſhe muſt appear. This wretched ſtate is the uſual conſequence of power and flattery. May my dear child never meet with the temptation of that exceſſive and ill-judged indulgence from a huſband, which ſhe has happily eſcaped from her parents, and which ſeldom fails to reduce women to the miſerable condition of a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured child, always unhappy from having nobody's will to ſtudy but its own! The inſolence of ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands for yourſelf, and ſuch diſregard to the choice and inclinations of others, can ſeldom fail to make
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:024452_0218_0FC73A1173908020"/>
you as many enemies as there are perſons obliged to bear with your humours; whilſt a compliant, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, and contented diſpoſition would render you happy in yourſelf, and beloved by all your compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions—particularly by thoſe, who live conſtantly with you; and, of what conſequence this is to your happineſs, a moment's reflexion will convince you. Family friendſhips are the friendſhips made for us, if I may ſo ſpeak, by God himſelf. With the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt intentions, he has knit the bands of family love, by indiſpenſable duties; and wretched are they who have burſt them aſunder by violence and ill-will, or worn them out by conſtant little diſobligations, and by the want of that attention to pleaſe, which the preſence of a ſtranger always inſpires, but which is ſo often ſhamefully neglected towards thoſe, whom it is moſt our duty and intereſt to pleaſe. May you, my dear, be wiſe enough to ſee that every faculty of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, every engaging qualification, which you poſſeſs, is exerted to the beſt advantage for thoſe, whoſe love is of moſt importance to you—for thoſe who live under the ſame roof, and with whom you are connected for life, either by the ties of blood, or by the ſtill more ſacred obligations of a voluntary engagement.</p>
            <p>To make you the delight and darling of your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, ſomething more is required than barely to be exempt from ill temper and troubleſome humours. The ſincere and genuine ſmiles of complacency and love muſt adorn your countenance. That ready com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance, that alertneſs to aſſiſt and oblige, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates true affection, muſt animate your beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and endear your moſt common actions. Polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs muſt accompany your greateſt familiarities, and reſtrain you from every thing that is really offenſive, or which can give a moment's unneceſſary pain. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, which is ſo apt to grow dull and inſipid in families, nay, in ſome to be almoſt wholly laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, muſt be cultivate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of whatever may conduce to the improvement or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent entertainment of each other.</p>
            <p>Reading, whether apart or in common, will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh uſeful and pleaſing ſubjects; and the ſprightli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of youth will naturally inſpire harmleſs mirth and native humour, if encouraged by a mutual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of diverting each other, and making the hours paſs agreeably in your own houſe: every amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that offers will be heightened by the partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of theſe de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If you have any acquired talent of entertainment, ſuch as muſic, painting, or the like, your own family are thoſe before whom you ſhould moſt wiſh to excel, and for whom you ſhould always be ready to exert yourſelf; not ſuffering the accompliſhments which you have gained, perhaps by their means, and at their expenſe, to lie dormant, till the arrival of a ſtranger gives you ſpirit in the performance. Where this laſt is the caſe, you may be ſure vanity is the only mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the exertion: A ſtranger will praiſe you more: But how little ſenſibility has that heart, which is not more gratified by the ſilent pleaſure painted on the countenance of a partial parent, or of an affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate brother, than by the empty compliments of a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor, who is perhaps inwardly more diſpoſed to cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſe and ridicule than to admire you!</p>
            <p>I have been longer in this letter than I intended; yet it is with difficulty I can quit the ſubject, becauſe I think it is ſeldom ſufficiently inſiſted on, either in books or in ſermons—and becauſe there are many perſons weak enough to believe themſelves in a ſafe and innocent courſe of life, while they are daily har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſing every body about them by their vexatious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours. But you will, I hope, conſtantly bear in mind, that you can never treat a fellow creature unkindly, without offending the kind Creator and Father of all —and that you can no way render yourſelf ſo accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to him as by ſtudying to promote the happineſs of others, in every inſtance, ſmall as well as great— The favour of God, and the love of your companions,
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:024452_0220_0FC73A1445473DF8"/>
will ſurely be deemed rewards ſufficient to animate your moſt fervent endeavours; yet this is not all: the diſpoſition of mind, which I would recommend, is its own reward, and is in itſelf eſſential to happineſs. Cultivate it therefore, my dear child, with your ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt diligence—and watch the ſymptoms of ill-tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, as they riſe, with a firm reſolution to conquer them, before they are even perceived by any other perſon. In every ſuch inward conflict, call upon your Maker to aſſiſt the feeble nature he hath given you—and ſacrifice to <hi>Him</hi> every feeling that would tempt you to diſobedience: So will you at length attain that true chriſtian meekneſs which is bleſſed in the ſight of God and man,
<q>which has the promiſe of this life, as well as of that which is to come.</q>
Then will you pity, in others, thoſe infirmities, which you have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered in yourſelf; and will think yourſelf as much bound to aſſiſt, by your patience and gentleneſs, thoſe who are ſo unhappy as to be under the dominion of evil paſſions, as you are to impart a ſhare of your riches to the poor and miſerable.</p>

            <p>THE hurry and impertinence of receiving and paying viſits on account of your marriage, being now over, you are beginning to enter into a courſe of life, where you will want much advice to divert you from falling into many errors, fopperies, and follies, to which your ſex is ſubject.

I have long wiſhed you might come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; becauſe I hoped, that from the goodneſs of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>our diſpoſition, and by following the counſel of wiſe friends, you might, in time, make yourſelf worthy of him. Your parents were ſo far in the right, that they did not produce you much into the world, whereby you avoided many wrong ſteps which others have taken, and have fewer ill impreſſions to be removed. But they failed, as it is generally the caſe, in too much neglecting to cultivate your mind; without which it is impoſſible to acquire or preſerve the friendſhip and eſteem of a wiſe man, who ſoon grows weary of acting the lover, and treating his wife like a miſtreſs, but wants a reaſonable compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:024452_0222_0FC73A1BF3E4C658"/>
and a true friend, through every ſtage of his life. It muſt be therefore your buſineſs to qualify yourſelf for thoſe offices; wherein I will not fail to be your director, as long as I ſhall think you deſerve it, by letting you know how you are to act, and what you are to avoid.</p>
            <p>And beware of deſpiſing or neglecting my inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whereon will depend not only your making a good figure in the world, but your own real happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as well as that of the perſon who ought to be the deareſt to you.</p>
            <p>I muſt therefore deſire you, in the firſt place, to be very ſlow in changing the <hi>modeſt behaviour</hi> of a <hi>virgin:</hi> It is uſual in young wives, before they have been many weeks married, to aſſume a bold, forward look and manner of talking, as if they intended to ſignify in all companies, that they were no longer girls, and conſequently that their whole demeanor, before they got a huſband, was all but a countenance and conſtraint upon their nature; whereas, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, if the votes of wiſe men were gathered, a very great majority would be in favour of thoſe ladies, who, after they were entered into that ſtate, rather choſe to double their portion of modeſty and reſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs.</p>
            <p>I muſt likewiſe warn you ſtrictly againſt the leaſt degree of <hi>fondneſs</hi> to your huſband, before any wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs whatſoever, even before your neareſt relations, or the very maids of your chamber. This proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is ſo exceedingly odious and diſguſtful to all who have either good breeding or good ſenſe, that they aſſign two very unamiable reaſons for it: the one is groſs hypocriſy; and the other has too bad a name to mention. If there is any difference to be made, your huſband is the loweſt perſon in company, either at home or abroad; and every gentleman preſent has a better claim to all marks of civility and diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from you. Conceal your eſteem and love in your own breaſt, and reſerve your kind looks and language for private hours, which are ſo many in the four and twenty, that they will afford time to
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:024452_0223_0FC73A1EF2950538"/>
employ a paſſion as exalted as any that was ever deſcribed in a <hi>French</hi> romance.</p>
            <p>Upon this head, I ſhould likewiſe adviſe you to differ in practice from thoſe ladies who affect abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of <hi>uneaſineſs</hi> while their huſbands are abroad— ſtart with every knock at the door—and ring the bell inceſſantly for the ſervants to let in their maſter; will not eat a bit at dinner or ſupper, if the huſband happens to ſtay out; and receive him at his return, with ſuch a medley of chiding and kindneſs, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſing him where he has been, that a ſhrew from <hi>Billingſgate</hi> would be a more eaſy and eligible com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion.</p>
            <p>Of the ſame leaven are thoſe wives, who, when their huſbands are gone a journey, muſt have a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter every poſt, upon pain of fits and hyſterics; and a day muſt be fixed for their return home, without the leaſt allowance for buſineſs, or ſickneſs, or acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, or weather: upon which, I can only ſay, that in my obſervation, thoſe ladies who are apt to make the greateſt clutter on ſuch occaſions, would liberally have paid a meſſenger for bringing them news, that their huſbands had broken <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>You will perhaps be offended, when I adviſe you to abate a little of that violent paſſion for <hi>fine clothes,</hi> ſo predominant in your ſex. It is a little hard, that ours, for whoſe ſake you wear them, are not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to be of your council. I may venture to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, that we will make an abatement at any time of four pounds a yard in a brocade, if the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies will but allow a ſuitable addition of care in the <hi>cleanlineſs</hi> and ſweetneſs of their perſons. For the ſatirical part of mankind will needs believe, that it is not impoſſible to be very fine and very filthy; and that the capacities of a lady are ſometimes apt to fall ſhort in cultivating cleanlineſs and finery together. I ſhall only add, upon ſo tender a ſubject, what a pleaſant gentleman ſaid concerning a ſilly woman of quality; that nothing could make her ſupportable but cutting off her head; for his ears were offended by her tongue, and his noſe by her hair and teeth.</p>

               <pb n="228" facs="unknown:024452_0224_0FC73A215B8BDD58"/>I am wholly at a loſs how to adviſe you in the choice of <hi>company,</hi> which, however, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> a point of as great importance as any in your life. If your general acquaintance be among ladies, who are your equals or ſuperiors, provided they have nothing of what is commonly called an ill reputation, you think you are ſafe; and this, in the ſtile of the world, will paſs for good company. Whereas I am afraid it will be hard for you to pick out one female ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance in this town, from whom you will not be in manifeſt danger of contracting ſome foppery, affectation, vanity, folly, or vice. Your only ſafe way of converſing with them is, by a firm reſolution to proceed, in your practice and behaviour, directly contrary to whatever they ſhall ſay and do: and this I take to be a good general rule, with very few ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions. For inſtance: in the doctrines they uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally deliver to young married women for managing their huſbands—their ſeveral accounts of their own conduct in that particular, to recommend it to your imitation—the reflexions they make upon others of their ſex for acting differently—their directions how to come off with victory upon any diſpute or quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel you may have with your huſband—the arts, by which you may diſcover and practiſe upon his weak ſide—when to work by flattery and inſinuation—when to melt him with tears, and when to engage with a high hand. In theſe, and a thouſand other caſes, it will be prudent to retain as many of their lectures in your memory as you can, and then determine to act in full oppoſition to them all.</p>
            <p>I hope your huſband will interpoſe his authority to limit you in the trade of <hi>viſiting;</hi> half a dozen fools are in all conſcience as many as you ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire; and it will be ſufficient for you to ſee them twice a year: For I think the faſhion does not exact, that viſits ſhould be paid to friends.</p>
            <p>I adviſe that your company at home ſhould conſiſt of men, rather than women. To ſay the truth, I never yet knew a tolerable woman to be fond of her own ſex. I confeſs, when both are mixed and well

               </gap>hoſen, and put their beſt qualities forward, there may be an intercouſe of civility and good-will; which, with the addition of ſome degree of ſenſe, can make converſation or any amuſement agreeable. But a knot of ladies got together by themſelves, is a very ſchool of impertinence and detraction, and it is well if thoſe be the worſt.</p>
            <p>Let your men-acquaintance be of your huſband's choice, and not recommended to you by any ſhe-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions; becauſe they will certainly fix a coxcomb upon you; and it will coſt you ſome time and pains before you can arrive at the knowledge of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing ſuch a one from a man of ſenſe.</p>
            <p>Never take a <hi>favourite waiting-maid</hi> into your ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet-council, to entertain you with hiſtories of thoſe ladies whom ſhe hath formerly ſerved, of their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions and their dreſſes; to inſinuate how great a fortune you brought, and how little you are allowed to ſquander; to appeal to her from your huſband, and to be determined by her judgment, becauſe you are ſure it will be always for you; to receive and diſcard ſervants by her approbation or diſlike; to engage you, by her inſinuations, into miſunderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with your beſt friends; to repreſent all things in falſe colours, and to be the common emiſſary of ſcandal.</p>
            <p>But the grand affair of your life will be to gain and preſerve the friendſhip and eſteem of your <hi>huſband.</hi> You are married to a man of good education and learning, of an excellent underſtanding, and an exact taſte. It is true, and it is happy for you, that theſe qualities in him are adorned with great modeſty, a moſt amiable ſweetneſs of temper, and an unuſual diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to ſobriety and virtue. But neither good-nature nor virtue will ſuffer him to eſteem you againſt his judgment; and though he is not capable of uſing you ill, yet you will in time grow a thing indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and perhaps contemptible, unleſs you can ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the loſs of youth and beauty with more durable qualities. You have a very few years to be young and handſome in the eyes of the world; and as few
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:024452_0226_0FC73A2A8AF30638"/>
months to be ſo in the eyes of a huſband, who is not a fool; for I hope you do not ſtill dream of charms and raptures, which marriage ever did, and ever will, put a ſudden end to. Beſides your's was a match of prudence and common good-liking, without any mixture of that ridiculous paſſion, which has no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but in play-books and romances.</p>
            <p>You muſt therefore uſe all endeavours to attain to ſome degree of thoſe accompliſhments which your huſband moſt values in other people, and for which he is moſt valued himſelf. You muſt improve your mind, by cloſely purſuing ſuch a method of ſtudy as I ſhall direct or approve of. You muſt get a collection of hiſtory and travels, which I will recommend to you, and ſpend ſome hours every day in reading them, and making extracts from them, if your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory be weak. You muſt invite perſons of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and underſtanding to an acquaintance with you, by whoſe converſation you may learn to correct your taſte and judgment; and when you can bring yourſelf to comprehend and reliſh the good ſenſe of others, you will arrive in time to think rightly your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and to become a reaſonable and agreeable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion. This muſt produce in your huſband a true rational love and eſteem for you, which old age will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ot diminiſh. He will have regard for your judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and opinion in matters of the greateſt weight; you will be able to entertain each other without a third perſon to relieve you by finding diſcourſe. The endowments of your mind will even make your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon more greeable to him: and when you are alone, your time will not lie heavy upon your hands, for want of ſome trifling amuſement.</p>
            <p>As little reſpect as I have for the generality of your ſex, it hath ſometimes moved me with pity, to ſee the lady of the houſe forced to withdraw imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after dinner, and this in families where there is not much drinking; as if it were an eſtabliſhed maxim, that women are incapable of all conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. In a room where both ſexes meet, if the men are diſcourſing upon any general ſubject, the
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:024452_0227_0FC73A2DB91985F0"/>
ladies never think it their buſineſs to partake in what paſſes, but in a ſeparate club entertain each other with the price and choice of lace, and ſilk, and what dreſſes they liked or diſapproved at the church or the play-houſe. And when you are among yourſelves, how naturally, after the firſt compliments, do you apply your hands to each other's lappets and ruffles, and mantua's, as if the whole buſineſs of your lives, and the public concern of the world depended upon the cut or colour of your dreſſes. As divines ſay, that ſome people take more pains to be damned, than it would coſt them to be ſaved; ſo your ſex employs more thought, memory and application, to be fools, than would ſerve to make them wiſe and uſeful. When I reflect on this, I cannot conceive you to be human creatures, but a ſort of ſpecies hardly a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree above a monkey; which has more diverting tricks than any of you; is an animal leſs miſchievous and expenſive; might in time be a tolerable critic in velvet and brocade; and, for aught I know, would equally become them.</p>
            <p>I would have you look upon finery as a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry folly, as all great ladies did, whom I have ever known: I do not deſire you to be out of the faſhion, but to be the laſt and leaſt in it. I expect that your dreſs ſhall be one degree lower than your fortune can afford; and in your own heart I would wiſh you to be an utter contemner of all diſtinctions which a finer petticoat can give you; becauſe it will neither make you richer, handſomer, younger, better natured, more virtuous, or wiſe, than if it hung upon a peg.</p>
            <p>If you are in company with men of learning, though they happen to diſcourſe of arts and ſciences out of your compaſs, yet you will gather more advantage by liſtening to them, than from all the nonſenſe and frippery of your own ſex; but if they be men of breeding as well as learning, they will ſeldom e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in any converſation where you ought not to be a hearer, and in time have your part. If they talk of the manners and cuſtoms of the ſeveral kingdoms of Europe, of travels into remoter nations, of the ſtate
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:024452_0228_0FC73A2EC447EAB0"/>
of their own country, or of the great men and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Greece and Rome; if they give their judgment upon Engliſh and French writers, either in verſe or proſe, or of the nature and limits of virtue and vice, it is a ſhame for an Engliſh lady not to reliſh ſuch diſcourſes, not to improve by them, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, by reading and information, to have her ſhare in thoſe entertainments, rather than turn aſide, as it is the uſual cuſtom, and conſult with the woman who ſits next her, about a new cargo of fans.</p>
            <p>It is a little hard, that not one gentleman's daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in a thouſand ſhould be brought to read or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand her own natural tongue, or to be a judge of the eaſieſt books that are written in it; as any one may find, who can have the patience to hear them, when they are diſpoſed to mangle a play or a novel, where the leaſt word out of the common road is ſure to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concert them. It is no wonder, when they are not ſo much as taught to ſpell in their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hildhood, nor can ever attain to it in their whole lives. I adviſe you therefore to read aloud, more or leſs, every day to your huſband, if he will permit you, or to any other friend, (but not a female one) who is able to ſet you right; and as for ſpelling, you may compaſs it in time, by making collections from the books you read.</p>
            <p>I know very well that thoſe, who are commonly called learned women, have loſt all manner of credit by their impertinent talkativeneſs and conceit of themſelves: but there is an eaſy remedy for this, if you once conſider, that after all the pains you may be at, you never can arrive, in point of learning, to the perfection of a ſchool-boy. The reading I would adviſe you to, is only for improvement of your own good ſenſe, which will never fail of being mended by diſcretion. It is a wrong method, and ill choice of books, that makes thoſe learned ladies juſt ſo much worſe for what they have read. And therefore it ſhall be my care to direct you better, a taſk for which I take myſelf to be not ill-qualified; becauſe I have ſpent more time, and have had more opportunities than many others, to obſerve and diſcover from what ources the various follies of women are derived.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="233" facs="unknown:024452_0229_0FC73A3053589B30"/>Pray obſerve how inſignificant things are the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon race of ladies, when they have paſſed their youth and beauty; how contemptible they appear to the men, and yet more contemptible to the younger part of their own ſex; and have no relief but in paſſing their afternoons in viſits, where they are never accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and their evenings at cards among each other; while the former part of the day is ſpent in ſpleen and envy, or in vain endeavours to repair, by art and dreſs, the ruins of time. Whereas I have known la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies at ſixty, to whom all the polite part of the court and town paid their addreſſes, without any farther view than that of enjoying the pleaſure of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</p>
            <p>I am ignorant of any one quality that is amiable in a man, which is not equally ſo in a woman: I do not except even modeſty and gentleneſs of nature. Nor do I know one vice or folly which is not equally deteſtable in both. There is, indeed, one infirmity which ſeems to be generally allowed you, I mean that of <hi>cowardice:</hi> yet there ſhould ſeem to be ſomething very capricious, that when women profeſs their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration for a colonel or a captain on account of his valour, they ſhould fancy it a very graceful, becoming quality in themſelves to be afraid of their own ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, to ſcream in a barge when the weather is calmeſt, or in a coach at the ring; to run from a cow at a hundred yards diſtance; to fall into fits at the ſight of a ſpider, an earwig, or a frog. At leaſt, if cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardice be a ſign of cruelty, (as it is generally grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) I can hardly think it an accompliſhment ſo deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as to be thought worth improving by affectation.</p>
            <p>And as the ſame virtues equally become both ſexes, ſo there is no quality whereby women endeavour to diſtinguiſh themſelves from men, for which they are not juſt ſo much the worſe, except that only of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedneſs; which, however, as you generally ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage it, is nothing elſe but affectation or hypocriſy. For as you cannot too much diſcountenance thoſe of our ſex, who preſume to take unbecoming liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties before you; ſo you ought to be wholly uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained

               </gap>en, when you have had ſufficient experience of their diſcretion.</p>
            <p>There is never wanting in this town, a tribe of bold, ſwaggering, rattling ladies, whoſe talents paſs among coxcombs for wit and humour; their excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy lies in rude, ſhocking expreſſions, and what they call <hi>running a man down.</hi> If a gentleman in their company happens to have any blemiſh in his birth or perſon, if any misfortune hath befallen his family or himſelf, for which he is aſhamed, they will be ſure to give him broad hints of it without any provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I would recommend you to the acquaintance of a common proſtitute, rather than to that of ſuch termagants as theſe. I have often thought that no man is obliged to ſuppoſe ſuch creatures to be women; but to treat them like inſolent raſcals diſguiſed in female habits, who ought to be ſtript and kicked down ſtairs.</p>
            <p>I will add one thing, although it be a little out of place, which is to deſire, that you will learn to value and eſteem your huſband for thoſe good qualities which he really poſſeſſeth, and not to fancy others in him which he certainly hath not. For although this latter is generally underſtood to be a mark of love, yet it is indeed nothing but affectation or ill judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is true, he wants ſo very few accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that you are in no great danger of erring on this ſide; but my caution is occaſioned by a lady of your acquaintance, married to a very valuable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whom yet ſhe is ſo unfortunate as to be always commending for thoſe perfections to which he can leaſt pretend.</p>
            <p>I can give you no advice upon the article of <hi>expenſe,</hi> only I think you ought to be well informed how much your huſband's revenue amounts to, and be ſo good a computer as to keep within it, in that part of the management which falls to your ſhare; and not to put yourſelf in the number of thoſe politic ladies, who think they gain a great point, when they have teized their huſbands to buy them a new equipage, a laced head, or a fine petticoat, without once conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
