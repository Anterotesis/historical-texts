            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE FAIR SOLITARY, OR FEMALE HERMIT.</head>
            <p>AT a viſit Alicia and ſome ladies of her acquaintance, paid Belinda at her country ſeat, a motion was made to put the horſes to the coach and take an airing. The ſeaſon of the year admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of getting out early, and their journey was to a meadow by a river ſide, with a large wood at the end. On one ſide of this wood was a pretty ſteep rock, on the top of which ſtood an hermitage, and at the foot of the rock ran a pretty broad ſtream, which ſeemed to forbid a farther paſſage. This wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter riſes from a torrent, which falls from the hill on the rocks. The murmuring noiſe it makes, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the natural caſcades it forms, in the gloom of the wood, preſents the eye with as agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able an entertainment as the moſt cultivated ſpot of ground can do.</p>
            <p>"This is my uſual walk, ſays Belinda, I like the ſilence of the place—It inſpires a ſoothing melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly.
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:047094_0005_10224C1462D37F30"/>
Hither I often repair alone, or without any company but my thoughts."</p>
            <p>"But do you never meet with the Hermit, and have you not yet ventured into his habitation?" ſaid one of the ladies. "I have not had a ſight of him yet," anſwered ſhe.</p>
            <p>Well, ſaid Alicia, I love theſe hermits, and ſhould be glad of a little talk with one of them. A way of life ſo much out of the common courſe makes me fancy, that they muſt needs be either vaſtly ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to, or very much below other men.</p>
            <p>Here the company alighted, and walked over a green, cloſe by the ſide of a brook. On going fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they came to a place, where the tall poplars which grew on the banks of the river hung very much over, and by their bending, formed a kind of a bridge, at the foot of which appeared a ſmall path in the rock, by which the aſcent was eaſy to the top; but whether made by nature, or contrived by art, is uncertain.</p>
            <p>The ladies, guided by their curioſity, followed this ſmall track, and ſoon got to the door of the hermitage. They ſaw at the ſame time a tall hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome woman haſtily enter this rural habitation, and pull the wicket after her; upon which, ſaid they, ſince women are admitted here, we may alſo claim the ſame right. Accordingly they knocked at the door, but nobody would anſwer. Continuing how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to make a loud noiſe, and giving thereby to underſtand that they would not be denied, the ſame perſon they had ſeen before, came out, and told them, that her little dwelling was not worthy the notice of ladies of their faſhion. They made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that their buſineſs was with the Hermit who lived there, and that they muſt ſee him; upon which the woman, perceiving it would be in vain to make any further reſiſtance, opened the door, but at the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:047094_0006_10224C17204CFF48"/>
ſame time told them that they would find nobody there but herſelf. The company ſtepped in haſtily, and having ſoon looked over the little cottage, which was plain and homely, but neat, were indeed much ſurprized to find no other perſon but the woman.</p>
            <p>"Our curioſity increaſes, ſays Belinda:—How can you live here by yourſelf? What an odd ſort of life is this for a woman, and what could make you embrace it? The more I view you, the more my aſtoniſhment increaſes. By your age and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance you ſeem unfit for ſo wild a dwelling, you might be an ornament to cities."—And indeed through a dejected air, and a ſweet modeſt coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, ſhe diſcovered much beauty. "Alas! re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the Solitary, I am unable to anſwer ſuch compliments. I am almoſt a ſtranger to the uſual language of the world, neither have I, during four years abode in this retreat, ſeen or converſed with any human creature."—Who then ſupplies you with the neceſſaries of life? aſked they.—"A young woman, returned ſhe, who had an affection for me, would fain have accompanied me hither, but, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a family, ſhe could not leave it. However, ſhe is ſettled in a neighbouring town, whence ſhe brings me twice a week more than is ſufficient for the ſupport of a life, which I wiſh I had, and which I ought to have loſt long ago."</p>
            <p>Theſe words were followed by a flood of tears, which, together with her appearance and diſtreſs, ſoon gained her the compaſſion of her fair gueſts. "In ſeeing you, cried they, it is impoſſible to avoid pitying you, whilſt the intereſt we take in your misfortunes intitles us to their recital. Let their cauſe be what it will, we ſhall ſtill pity you. If you are wretched through the fault of others, we
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:047094_0007_10224C18B3C4B368"/>
will join in your reſentment; if by your own, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune only ſhall be to blame, and you ſhall never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear guilty in our eyes."</p>
            <p>"Your indulgence and good-nature, ladies, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied ſhe, will not reconcile me to myſelf. I have quitted the world to ſhun my own being, but am ſtill always preſent to myſelf. I thought that, when I ſhould no longer have witneſſes to my follies, I might then poſſibly forgive and forget them.—But, mercileſs to myſelf, I am ever condemning and puniſhing them. The ſilence of theſe woods brings them freſher to my mind, and adds new feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their ſting. Diſengaged from all things elſe, they alone are the employment of my whole leiſure time."—"Perhaps, fair lady," reſumed Alicia, "it is an over delicacy only that makes you thus cruel to yourſelf. However, you cannot well refuſe the recital of your misfortunes to people that already take ſo large a ſhare in them."</p>
            <p>She would have excuſed herſelf, but the ladies, whoſe curioſity was greatly raiſed, aſſuring her they would not leave her till ſhe had acquainted them with her unfortunate hiſtory, ſhe began thus.</p>
            <p>"Since, then, ladies, you inſiſt upon it, I ſhall give you a plain narrative of my life, in which, though I may not have the merit of appearing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent in your eyes, I ſhall at leaſt have that of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſincere.—I am born of a noble family. My father had the happineſs of having ſerved his king and country well, in many important occaſions, and enjoyed great places at court; but, meeting after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards with ſome injuſtice in having a rival preferred to a poſe he thought his due, he grew highly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted. At that very time he had done the king of S—a conſiderable piece of ſervice, ſo that, thinking all his obligations to his country, and an ungrateful prince, cancelled by the unjuſt treatment
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:047094_0008_10224C1B2250FD08"/>
he had met with, he engaged in a rebellion that was raiſed againſt him. As he had the chief command in a great province, it was an eaſy matter for him to bring about a change of maſters amongſt the people of his government; he was very indifferent about making terms for himſelf. The ſervices he was doing the cauſe, and a large province he was ſubduing, were his hoſtages and ſecurities for the promiſes they made him, whilſt on our part we had nothing but bare words to depend upon. In the meanwhile all our eſtates and preferments were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited; in lien of which we had only fine promiſes, which were but indifferently performed. I was then very young, had loſt my mother, and was the delight of my father. I had an only brother, ſome years older than myſelf, who went to the army with my father, and learned the art of war under his direction.</p>
            <p>As for myſelf, I was to be ſent to one of thoſe houſes that are deſtined for the education of young ladies, but the princeſs Zaide, whoſe huſband had formerly commanded in our province, being very intimate with my father, begged of him to leave me with her, which he conſented to. This lady was fond of children, they were her chief diverſion, and ſhe had but one ſon. I was brought up with as much care as if I had been her own daughter: ſhe appointed me governeſſes and proper maſters, who cultivated all my good inclinations. She took a kind of pleaſure and amuſement in dreſſing me, and often gave little entertainments to the young children of my age. I had the good luck to pleaſe in them, and always ſtrove to out do even what was thought <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in the reſt.</p>
            <p>The prince Camillus (that was her ſon's name) was <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> years older than I. He had a noble and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>. We lived together, and whenever
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:047094_0009_10224C1CF7351A38"/>
he had done with his maſters, he would ſeek my company with great fondneſs. In all his actions he gave me a remarkable preference over my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions. As I advanced in age, the graces, I am told, were not wholly unmindful of my perſon, and his liking to me increaſed every day. I too early experienced the pleaſure of being loved, and found a ſatisfaction in it. It is an unhappy thing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract ſuch an habit from our infancy.</p>
            <p>Prince Camillus's friends had deſigned him for the duke of * * *'s daughter. Her name was Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leria: ſhe was the heireſs of the family, ſo that an ample fortune and diſtinguiſhed titles made her a match worthy of him. He was often conducted to pay his court to her; ſhe likewiſe came to wait on the old princeſs, and we often met together at our little plays and entertainments. She was hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and could not bear the remarkable preference our young lover gave me: in revenge ſhe would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten reflect with ſcorn and contempt on my fortune; but the prince's commendations and my glaſs made me perfectly eaſy; for I was already of an age to find a ſatisfaction in being handſome.</p>
            <p>His reluctance to viſit the lady Valeria ſoon grew remarkable. Hitherto we had lived together with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any manner of conſtraint, and his attachment to me had been looked upon as of no conſequence; but as it increaſed every day, it began to grow ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and he was therefore forbid to enter my apartment.</p>
            <p>His love quickened by this prohibition. He grew ſad and melancholy, and as he was of a hot and fiery temper, the reſtraint that was laid upon his inclinations acted upon his health in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that he fell ſick. His mother was greatly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed at the accident. Valeria came too ſeveral times to viſit him, but he paid her regard with ſo
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:047094_0010_10224C1FC6E390A8"/>
much coldneſs, that ſhe was prodigiouſly nettled at the return. In the mean while his illneſs gamed ſo much upon him, that other conſiderations were laid aſide to apply to the ſaving of his life. He was therefore allowed to ſee me, and I was accordingly conducted to his apartment by the women who had the care of me. The ſight of me had a ſpeedier effect upon him than all the art of the phyſicians, and his health returned in proportion to the liberty he had of being in my company. His mother, however, was revenged on me for the neceſſity ſhe was reduced to of allowing an intercourſe, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of which were ſo much dreaded. She no longer retained the ſame tender friendſhip for me; the commendations that were beſtowed on me, and with which ſhe was formerly ſo well pleaſed, now grew offenſive to her, and I was often puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for being liked too much.</p>
            <p>The prince, having at laſt perfectly recovered his health, became in a ſhort time the moſt accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lord in the court. He began now to aſſume an air of haughtineſs and independence, and ſlight the aſſiſtance of his maſters, but retained ſtill an infinite reſpect for his mother; though I was the limit of his obedience. He obeyed her in every thing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in what related to me.</p>
            <p>At length ſhe expoſtulated the matter one day with him, and aſked what he meant at laſt to do by his attachment for me? "Every thing, madam, anſwered he; for when I meet with birth, virtue and beauty in the object of my affections, I think I may, without bluſhing, own my paſſion and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther intentions." So ſmart and reſolute an anſwer made her tremble: ſhe repreſented to him the great diſtance there was between him and me, the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes of my family, the loſs of our preferments, and the forfeiture of our eſtates; to all which he
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:047094_0011_10224C21EA451F08"/>
replied, "There fortune only is to blame, not ſhe; and may you not too, madam, be a little in fault, to ſet ſo high a value on that ſort of advantages which do not depend on us?"—"But, anſwered the princeſs, you find in Valeria both thoſe you are taken with, and the others you reproach me with making too great an account of." "Oh, madam! replied the young prince, my heart and your eyes are widely different in their judgments. You ſee, but I feel; and whatever inequality there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween perſons, love brings them all to a level."</p>
            <p>The princeſs now ſaw that there was no time to be loſt, but that I muſt be ſent out of the way, and accordingly I was put into a houſe deſigned for a retreat from the world. The prince was no ſooner appriſed of the news, but he flew to the place, and threatened the perſons appointed for my keepers to have recourſe to the laſt extremities, if they did not produce me. His menaces were of no effect; they perſiſted in their refuſal, and proteſted they would let no body ſee me without an order from the princeſs, his mother. He went to her next, and ſpoke with a tranſport of heat, which offended her. He ſaid, that he was not obliged to her for a life ſhe was endeavouring to make ſo wretched; that the happineſs of his days would be to unite his fortune with mine, and that her power did not extend to an empire over the mind; and, upon her attempting to ſet before him her authority and his duty, he told her ſmartly, that the heart had rights and dues of its own, apart from all others.</p>
            <p>The princeſs was prudent: ſhe ſaw it would be in vain to ſtruggle againſt the ſtream: and therefore told <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> that ſhe would ſacrifice her <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> to her regard for him, that ſhe looked upon him as a perſon out of order, who claimed her pity; but that he could not refuſe <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to be ſix month with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:047094_0012_1022AA36ABD45258"/>
ſeeing me, ſince ſuch a compliance would coſt him the leſs, as the campaign was approaching, and he muſt ſet out to take upon him the command of the troops the king had thought ſit to truſt him with; and that ſhe was perſuaded the paſſion that poſſeſſed him, had not quite extinguiſhed the love of glory in his ſoul.—This, indeed, was true; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver man enjoyed thoſe two ſentiments in a higher degree; neither did the one in the leaſt take from the other.</p>
            <p>He could not well deny the princeſs, but aſſured her withal that his paſſion was not to be leſſened by time, and that reflection, which never fails curing ordinary flames, would but increaſe his.</p>
            <p>Whatever he could ſay to the contrary, ſhe was ſtill in hopes that time and abſence would do much for her, and therefore now bent her thoughts on endeavouring to divert one idea by another. She procured him a moſt magnificent equipage, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for his retinue the moſt pompous attendants that could be found, and joined to theſe ſeveral old officers who had behaved beſt in the king's ſervice, to train him up to greatneſs. Nothing was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten that might inſpire him with the love of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and, as he had a vaſt ſhare of honour, he did not heſitate to embrace a courſe ſo much becoming his birth. He prepared therefore to ſet out for the army, where his ſenſe of glory was equalled by the ſhining opportunities he had to purſue it.</p>
            <p>A young man of merit who belonged to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſoon became his confidant. He was born of a good family, and could take the liberty of often diſcourſing him about his preſent ſituation, and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying his being abandoned to a paſſion, which, as it diſtracted his mother, ſo it might likewiſe caſt a ſtain upon his own reputation. Love, he told him, was not juſtifiable in great men till they had paid
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:047094_0013_1022AA3A88CD6EE8"/>
the tribute due to glory, and that it might indeed be a ſtate of paſſage in the life of an hero, but that glory was a qualification that claimed a laſting place therein. "Deſcended from the blood you ſpring from, continued he, and with the merit you poſſeſs, you have vaſt expectations of courage and magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity to anſwer."</p>
            <p>This was in vain, he was not to be heard yet.—The prince was abandoned to a deſpair, from which every thing might be feared. He had often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to the place of my confinement, and, not having been able to obtain a ſight of me, had with difficulty been withheld from the laſt violences.—His confidant Timander, who ſoothed his anguiſh by his gentleneſs, and the complaiſant diſcharge of the truſt he placed in him, promiſed him at laſt to bring me a letter from him. Accordingly he wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the princeſs, and repreſented to her, that it was neceſſary to compound a little with the prince's grief; that were ſhe to inſiſt upon a ſtrict compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with her orders, and exact obedience with too much rigour, ſhe might drive him to the greateſt extremities; that ſhe ought not to put her power in competition with the force of love, nor ſet up her rights againſt thoſe of the heart, for neither were to be controuled by authority; that the prince ought to be pitied and diverted by ſome great object, without being made ſenſible of their deſign; and that in exalted and haughty ſouls there were great reſources to be found to work them to our ends. He concluded by acquainting her, that the prince had deſired him to bring me a letter, that he was accordingly come to receive her orders, and that as to himſelf, ſhe might reſt aſſured ſhe had nothing to fear from the confidence her ſon placed in him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:047094_0014_1022AA3C4BBF4B30"/>
The princeſs having yielded to theſe arguments, Timander came and found me melancholy and thoughtful. Your beauty, madam, ſaid he, makes ſtrange work already. Is this the firſt trial of your ſkill? I gave him no anſwer, but what he could read in my confuſed countenance and baſhful looks. However, continued he, here is a letter the prince has ordered me to deliver into your hands.—I muſt not take it, ſaid I, and am extremely ſorry for the effect, what you are pleaſed to call beauty, has had upon him. I know what I am, and at how great a diſtance the misfortunes of my family place me from him. I am bound by the ties of gratitude and reſpect to the princeſs, his mother; and if my eyes have had the misfortune to pleaſe him, my heart has had no ſhare in the deſign. Therefore tell him I beſeech him to forget me. Timander here again preſſed me to receive the billet he had obtained leave to bring me; and the perſon whoſe care I was under, bidding me take and read it, I accordingly opened it, and found theſe words:</p>
            <p>"Nothing, madam, but the paſſion you have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired in me can exceed the affliction I am under. Expreſſions are too poor for what I feel. You are perſecuted for my ſake, and your ſufferings alone cauſe all the tortures that diſtract me. I now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover my love without diſguiſe or reſerve, a boldneſs I borrow from the innocence of my intentions;—and as every thing oppoſes my deſigns, my deſires become the more inflamed, and my reſolutions the better confirmed. Are not you formed, madam, to be loved? In you I find all my excuſes.—When a man loves as much as I do, the greateſt pleaſure he can feel, is to find that he loves with the juſteſt reaſon: and this, madam, is a ſatisfaction I muſt owe you all the moments of my life."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:047094_0015_1022AA3EF953A0F0"/>
Well, madam, ſays Timander, will you not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour us with an anſwer to this billet?—I do not think it at all proper, anſwered I.—Why ſo, add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he, you are not forbid it?—My duty to myſelf, returned I, forbids it.</p>
            <p>After an hour's converſation he took his leave, and deſired to know what he ſhould tell the prince? Tell him, ſaid I, that I have a grateful heart, and am moved with his ſorrow; but that, in the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances we are in, the beſt thing for him to do is, to think no more of me, and for me to forget him, if I can. He went back to the prince with this anſwer, which did not ſeem to diſpleaſe him.</p>
            <p>Returning to my chamber, I read the prince's letter over again with a concern of tenderneſs, which would have given him the higheſt ſatisfaction.—Not long after this meſſage, I heard he was upon his departure for the army. His mother had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured him the moſt ſplendid equipage in the world, and purchaſed him one of the firſt poſts in the army. She was, by this, opening a door to honours, and he was ſetting out with diſtinction in the road to glory. Timander called once more upon me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his departure, and brought this ſecond letter.</p>
            <p>"I am departing for the army, madam. I muſt anſwer the call of glory to reach the throne of love, and become worthy of you. I therefore fancy you are the prize I am going to conquer.—But alas! love is not to be merited, and I muſt abandon my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to a grief worthy of your abſence and my heart. Do but think, madam, that I am without you: that will be ſufficient to deſerve your pity.—I would ſacrifice my life to my evil ſtars, but that I know it is conſecrated to you, and love will claim an account of it at my hands."</p>
            <p>Timander painted, in the livelieſt colours, the diſtreſs the prince was in. The picture affected me
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:047094_0016_1022AA4196D96938"/>
prodigiouſly. I felt my boſom rent by a thouſand different agitations. I thought myſelf vaſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to him: I had hopes, fears, and even deſires; yet all theſe paſſions were not well diſtinguiſhed in my ſoul. I was flattered with the prince's love; but then again I was too much reminded of the diſtance between him and me. This ſtartled my pride, and, when ſelf-opinion took up the ſcales to weigh our merits, I own I did not find myſelf ſo vaſtly beneath him. It is true, I might indeed have renounced an alliance I was made to buy at too high a price, but in the attempt the prince's love and diſtreſs ſtopped me ſhort.—He was ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing his greatneſs to me, and I my pride to him. He had not been long in the army before he gave proofs of his bravery. In him courage was joined with a great ſhare of ſenſe and prudence (though the latter was ſtill confined to his head, and had not yet reached his heart) whilſt reading and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection ſupplied his want of experience; all which gave reaſon to hope he would one day be a great general.</p>
            <p>There was a great battle fought a few days after his arrival. The enemies finding themſelves hard preſſed in the poſt they occupied, and fearing to be attacked in their intrenchments, reſolved to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand with us. Accordingly having made all the previous diſpoſitions to a battle, they fell upon us at a time, when by their ſituation we would have thought they ſhould only have kept on the defenſive. However, they came up like deſperadoes, determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſell dearly their lives, and victory had long remained doubtful, when the left wing, which my father commanded, began at laſt to give way.—The prince, who was at the head of the infantry, flew immediately to his aſſiſtance. He found him wounded, fallen under his horſe, and all about him
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:047094_0017_1022AA4428E9C140"/>
either dead, or put to flight. He ran to him, lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him from the ground, re-mounted him on a ſpare horſe, bound up his wound with his handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, and rallying the troops, charged briſkly the enemy, routed them entirely, and obtained a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete victory, which coſt them all their artillery and baggage, beſides a great number of priſoners.</p>
            <p>My father began to feel his hurt after he was out of the heat of the action, and was obliged to be carried to his tent, where the ſurgeons ſearched his wound, and found it very conſiderable. The firſt thing he did was, to enquire after the perſon to whom he owed his life, and being told that it was the prince who had thus ſaved him, he could not conquer his concern for being ſo greatly obliged to him: is it poſſible, ſaid he, that I muſt be ſo infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely in his debt? All the time of his illneſs, the prince never ceaſed his generous offices; he ſent for the moſt eminent ſurgeons to dreſs his wound; had his own officers to wait on him, and more than once offered him his purſe, which he conſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to accept. Word was ſent me of my father's wound, how I owed his life to the prince, and of all the kind offices he had received from him during his illneſs. On this, the infinite regard and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I had for ſo dear a parent, made me think I might ſend the prince my acknowledgements, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out treſpaſſing againſt the rules of decency. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, without conſulting any body, I wrote him the following letter.</p>
            <p>"I don't think I tranſgreſs the laws of decency, by thus expreſſing the grateful ſenſe of my obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to you for having preſerved a life ſo precious to me as is that of a father, whom I honour beyond all expreſſion.—Alas! Sir, muſt eſteem, gratitude, and natural ſentiments all join to force a heart, which would have choſen to yield only to its incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:047094_0018_1022AA46B3F0BCD8"/>
and your tenderneſs? Fame is already wholly taken up with you. For this am I to thank glory alone, and muſt not love claim ſome ſhare of the debt?"</p>
            <p>I feared a long while for my father's life; but at laſt he gave ſome hopes of a recovery, to haſten which he cauſed himſelf to be carried into the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, whither I followed immediately to wait on him, and employ my cares for a health that was ſo dear to me.</p>
            <p>The prince returned covered with glory. He often came in a friendly manner to viſit my father, and I found him ſtill the ſame towards me as when we parted. I acknowledged the obligations I lay under, and the ſentiments of gratitude he could claim from me; but theſe expreſſions offended him. I muſt have no returns but from your heart, ſaid he: delicacy of ſentiments is an attendant of love, which quickens all its pleaſures, though it often prepares us many vexations. But what muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of me, if with ſentiments ſo natural, ſo ſtrong, and ſo fond as mine, you ſhould not anſwer them, and I could inſpire you with nothing but thoughts of gratitude?—Yet, replied I, I muſt not entertain any others.</p>
            <p>There began now to be ſome talk of peace, and the prince, notwithſtanding his youth, held ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed a rank, that he was called into all the conſultations held upon that ſubject. They ended at laſt in a general pacification, and the prince took particular care to have my father included in the treaty. Accordingly, by virtue of a general am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, and a ſeparate article for our family, our eſtates were to be reſtored to us as well as the places my father held before the war, which he was left at liberty either to take poſſeſſion of again, or to accept of an equivalent in lieu thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:047094_0019_1022AA4999CA18B8"/>
My father's health returned with the ſatisfaction of once more ſeeing his family in a flouriſhing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. The peace occaſioned an univerſal joy throughout the kingdom, and nothing was thought of at court, but the celebrating of it by feſtivals and rejoicings. My father now left the country to take a houſe in town, and ſet up an equipage ſuitable to his birth. As I was already paſſed my childhood, he took me home, but deſired a lady of his acquaintance, who had loſt her huſband, and had ſuffered from the frowns of fortune, to come and live with us, and have an eye over my conduct. Her name was Leonora: I was ordered to ſhow her as much obedience as if ſhe were my mother: ſhe had a great ſhare of underſtanding, had ſeen the world, and took care that I did not ſtir a ſtep with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her.</p>
            <p>Very ſoon after, I was preſented to the queen. Her majeſty received me with great kindneſs, treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me with diſtinction, and ſaid very handſome things of my perſon.</p>
            <p>The whole winter ſeaſon was ſpent in diverſions. The queen was young, and had a taſte for pleaſures. There was not an aſſembly but what ſhe was ſo kind as to admit me into, and I ſhowed away with pretty good ſucceſs. Prince Camillus made likewiſe one at every ball that was given. He danced exceeding well; his perſon was above any lord's at court, and the glory he had acquired in the late campaign, ſeemed to caſt a new luſtre on him. I had the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of hearing him praiſed, and he the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of finding his choice univerſally approved.—Whenever we were dancing together, buſy whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perings behind us declared how every body agreed in pronouncing us made for one another.</p>
            <p>The princeſs Valeria bore with impatience the figure I made at court, and the queen's kindneſs to
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:047094_0020_1022AA4D2F121C20"/>
me, but much more the prince's fondneſs. She fell into ſo deep a melancholy, that I could not help pitying her condition. Her paſſion glowed in her eyes; a ſecret langour was ſpread over her whole perſon; grief preyed upon her beauty; and, though Nature intended her fair, Love had now ordered it otherwiſe. She had handſome features, but a wan and pale look robbed them of all their charms.</p>
            <p>She comforted herſelf by eaſing her mind to a young relation who lived with her, and had her confidence. One day as I was walking in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace garden with Leonora, we eſpied the princeſs and her confidant entering into a pretty dark grove, upon which I propoſed to my friend to follow them. Accordingly we ſtept after, and entered a ſide alley next to that where ſhe was ſitting with her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion. She ſpoke with heat enough to be heard. What, ſaid ſhe, would you have me do with myſelf? I live but for him, and yet I ſhall never gain his love.—Forgive him this piece of levity, ſaid the other, he will ſoon return to you. How? replied Valeria, you would have me not concerned at his uſage! And you call levity a natural paſſion which he cannot reſiſt! A paſſion, to which he ſacrifices his love to me, his glory, his fortune, and all he owes to the beſt of mothers! My heart has too often found his excuſes: when we love, we forgive long; but you do not ſee him with eyes as intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as mine. What cold inſenſibility has he not ſhown for my pains!—There is a kind of meanneſs in feeling and ſuffering for thoſe that do not feel for us. I can no longer bear the rackings of my heart, and the ſtinging reproaches of my pride; I muſt, I will ſilence them, and fall upon ſome me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod worthy of me. What may that be? anſwered her relation. Why, to retire forever from court,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:047094_0021_1022AA4EB9808520"/>
replied ſhe;—She could not proceed further, a flood of tears interrupting her ſpeech.—Strange reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! anſwered her confidante; you would puniſh yourſelf, becauſe another is guilty! Here, night coming on, they withdrew.</p>
            <p>I ſeemed ſo affected with the princeſs's affection, that Leonora could not help expreſſing her ſurprize. What! ſaid ſhe to me, muſt one enter into a rival's grief?—I never feared her, replied I, and, as I have had nothing to diſpute with her, I cannot now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the ill-natured pleaſure of triumphing in her diſtreſs. The prince's heart was tendered me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my wiſhing or deſiring it; and therefore, as ſhe gives me neither fear nor uneaſineſs, I cannot hate her. I have ſome ſhare of good-nature, and muſt pity her condition.</p>
            <p>At my return home I found one of the queen's gentlemen, who brought me word, that ſhe had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged me to an entertainment the king was to give, on account of the marriage of the princeſs Flavia, one of her majeſty's relations; that in caſe I had not jewels enough, ſhe would ſend me ſome, and deſired to know what I might want. I told him I had a ſuit of green velvet and gold, which would do very well with a ſet of rubies, if I could get them. I withdrew afterwards to prepare my dreſs, and, out of complaiſance to her majeſty, took more pains about it than otherwiſe I would have done.</p>
            <p>The day appointed for this magnificent enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, was ſpent in all manner of diverſions.—There was a play acted in the evening, which was followed by a grand ſupper and a ball; and nothing in the world could be more gallant and better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted. The princeſs Flavia looked perfectly charming: for, though ſhe is not a regular beauty, ſhe has ſo much youth and bloom, with ſo beautiful
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:047094_0022_1022AA504813BBD8"/>
a colour, that ſhe may ſurpaſs others handſomer than herſelf.</p>
            <p>About the middle of the ball there was a great ſtir at the door, which engaged the attention and eyes of the whole company. It was the duke of Praxede who was juſt arriving from the army. His coming was quite unexpected; he had made a ſhining campaign, had beaten the enemy, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the room with an air of confidence, ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his natural valour and good mein. I had never ſeen him before: he was not better acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with me; and, in caſting his eyes towards me, I heard him ſay ſome very fine things. His words, his looks, and the very found of his voice threw my ſoul into an agitation, which I had never felt before. The prince and he were then at variance; they were both driving towards the ſame goal, and each other's rival in glory and merit; upon which account they had been ſeparated, and the court had not thought fit to employ them both in the ſame army.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as he arrived, the princeſs Flavia offered him her hand to dance: he took me next, but I was ſo confuſed, that had I dared, I would have refuſed his civility.</p>
            <p>All the time the ball laſted, he kept his eyes conſtantly on me: I turned mine from him, and would fain refuſe him my looks, as a favour he had no right to. However, he took me ſeveral times to dance, and made himſelf ſo remarkable, that it was thought he did it on purpoſe to ſpite the prince. You may be ſure I had no ſhare in the deſign, and indeed, as ſoon as the ball was over, I ran home in great haſte, and the prince left the company to conduct me.</p>
            <p>"Your charms, madam, ſaid he, (when at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſpeak) operate on every body, and the duke

of Praxede comes to ſwell the number of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts. Indeed, Sir, replied I, his affecting to take me ſo often to dance, and his ſtaring at me, has given me a great deal of uneaſineſs.—But why ſo, madam? anſwered he. So much care, never to caſt a look towards him, ſhows that you dreaded his eyes, and was diffident of your own. A perſon that feels nothing, is always free and open; and over-acting our part, on certain occaſions, often betrays a conſciouſneſs of not being always right. But, replied I, what would you quarrel with me about? I never ſaw him before in my life.—That may be, anſwered he again, but he has ſeen you, and you were handſomer than uſual to-day: nay, he loves you, and that alone, even though you were not guilty, is enough to make me wretched."</p>
            <p>Ever after this the prince watched me with a caution that gave me offence. The duke on his part followed me every where, and I always found him ready to catch my looks in all public places. The prince was informed of all his ſteps; he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came peeviſh and ſuſpicious, and, though he could lay nothing to my charge, yet he was not ſatisfied with me. He thought the duke very inſolent to pretend to a perſon, to whom he had been ſo long engaged; but for my part, I own I fancied he wanted only to teaze and alarm the prince, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that, he thought if I could not ſerve the purpoſe of his heart, I might at leaſt gratify his vanity. Such a notion was highly offenſive to me, and therefore I ſhunned him carefully. The prince himſelf took notice of this; whereupon I opened my mind to him one day, telling him I could not believe I was any ways concerned in his grief, ſince, were it ſo, it would be doing me the higheſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice; to which he anſwered, "You do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſeem to join with the duke againſt me; you
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:047094_0024_1022AA56996C8B80"/>
avoid him, and ſhow me even a greater regard than ever, and yet you are guilty: nay, you are ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing it, and you would fain, by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of kindneſs, make amends for the wrongs you are doing me.—Good Heavens, cried I, what then is my crime!—You love the duke, anſwered he: yes, Mademoiſelle, you doat on him, and 'tis I that muſt inform you thereof. I know I am going to appear whimſical and ridiculous, and juſtify all your wrongs. I provide you with weapons againſt myſelf, which you will turn to a proper uſe. I ſee and feel the whole of my wretchedneſs, but I am driven to it." All this was attended by a flood of tears, and taking leave he told me further, that he was going to conceal his diſtraction and deſpair from my ſight.</p>
            <p>He left me in a greater confuſion than I can well deſcribe: I found I wanted to ſhake off my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and durſt not yet enquire into the cauſe of the various emotions I felt raiſed in my breaſt; when having thrown myſelf on a couch, Leonora entered the room.</p>
            <p>I was ſurprized at her coming, and aſhamed ſhe ſhould be witneſs of my diſorder. Which ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, Come, ſaid ſhe, recover yourſelf: I ſee you would conceal your uneaſineſs and ſentiments from my knowledge; but you are to blame. Don't take me for a ſevere cenſor, that would condemn all your motions, but look upon me as a friend on whom you may depend, and one capable of comforting and conducting you in the moſt delicate circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of your life. Do not fancy I ſhall make a crime of your ſenſibility. A heart may be ſenſible and innocent too; and, to merit your confidence, by my example, I am willing to let you into mine. Here ſhe pauſed a while, and ſeemed to repent hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gone ſo far; but I preſſed her with ſo much
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:047094_0025_1022AA592C694340"/>
tenderneſs to proceed in her ſtory, that ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued thus:</p>
            <p>I am acquainted with love, and have but too dearly paid the tribute due to that little god.—You have no doubt heard of the misfortunes of my family, and how I loſt my huſband and brother both at the ſame time. The one was the ſupport, and the other the hope of our houſe. My brother was taken in arms againſt his ſovereign, and left his head upon a ſcaffold. Soon after my huſband paid with his life a victory he gained over the enemies of the ſtate. Thus was I in one moment ſtript of all my preſent advantages and hopes to come; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to lament a dead huſband in place, and much eſteemed, and to ſue for a brother's life and honour. But alas! he forfeited both together, with his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, ſo that I was left without wealth or fortune. The notions of greatneſs diſappeared, and all the charms that are the attendants of a diſtinguiſhed ſtation in life, vaniſhed in an inſtant. I found my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf forſaken and without ſupport, and my only hopes were, that, having been expoſed to the frowns of fortune, I ſhould at leaſt be forgotten by love; but both joined forces to perſecute me. Diſpenſe me, madam, with the reſt—</p>
            <p>And now, ladies, though every thing ſhe ſaid is ſtill freſh in my memory, from my having been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry attentive to this mark of confidence ſhe gave me (wherein ſhe acted very artfully to come at my heart and ſecret) yet as ſhe is unknown to you, the repetition will not perhaps be thought very mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, therefore you will give me leave to drop her hiſtory here—By no means, ſaid we all, pray let us know the reſt of Leonora's adventures: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Solitary continued in theſe words:</p>
            <p>—We like to be let into the weakneſſes of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple we eſteem. We always long to reſemble them
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:047094_0026_1022AA5BB7CA70B0"/>
in ſomething; if their eminent qualities leave <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> far behind, their foibles bring us to a nearer <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. That is no ſmall comfort, and in my particular cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, it was too important for my repoſe, to find a friend in a perſon who had been ſet as a watch over my actions. The confidence ſhe was going to place in me, was a kind of ſecurity that anſwered for her, and I was in thoſe moments, when a ſecret lies ſo heavy on the heart. I longed to ſpeak to her of what I felt, and was too happy to find in her, not only advices for my conduct, but the ſame dear weakneſſes which render us more indulgent towards thoſe of other people. I preſſed her there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to proceed.</p>
            <p>You will then, ſaid ſhe, have the full extent of my ſecret. I am very much afraid the recital will make all my wounds bleed afreſh, and give new life to my paſſion; but however, that ſhall not prevent my complying with your requeſt. My ſentiments being the only pleaſure left me, I will indulge them in their full career. They are indeed of a quite new nature. Olindo in Taſſo is quoted as a model of ſentiments. He is made to ſay, that he deſires much, hopes little, and aſks nothing; but for my part I neither wiſh, hope, nor aſk at all. My paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is ſupported by nothing; it ſubſiſts, feeds, and increaſes by itſelf: and thus have I for a long time been taken up with a ſentiment moſt ſingular in its kind.</p>
            <p>I ſaw at a friend's ſome years ago, the count * * *, you will excuſe me telling his name. To me he appeared a moſt amiable perſon, though, with ſo great ſhare of the qualifications of the mind, perſonal advantages would be leſs requiſite. From the firſt moment I beheld him he engaged my at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, (which is doing a great deal with me)
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:047094_0027_1022AA5F8DEC7018"/>
and I continued ſeeing him both at my friend's and my own houſe. There was at that time a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that laid ſome pretenſions to my heart. We had formerly been on the point of marriage, and, when my family had diſpoſed of my liberty in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of my late huſband, he had been afflicted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond expreſſion. His ſtars had decreed he ſhould ever love me; therefore, unable yet to reſolve to give me over, he ſtill diverted his ſorrow with the notion that my heart did not go along with my hand. His eſteem and reſpect for me had indeed ſtopped and repreſſed his ſentiments, but he was ever watching mine, and telling me every day, that if I diſpoſed of them to another, he ſhould die with grief.</p>
            <p>He ſoon obſerved, that my regard for the count was changing into tenderneſs; my eyes had inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt me, and revealed my ſecret: and upon this he vented himſelf in reproaches that very much offended me.</p>
            <p>All this was yet unperceived by the happy man. Not but that he ſeemed to have ſome ſlender incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation for me, and I was ready prepared to reject his declaration, if he ſhould make any. He has ſince been fully revenged for my idle reſolution.—If he had any ſentiments at all, they have ſtopt ſhort, whilſt mine have had their full run. It was long before I could be clear in what I felt. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens! how artfully doth the heart in thoſe caſes conceal its inclination, not to alarm our reaſon and modeſty? It is a bare nothing at firſt: it is the mind we are taken with; and, in ſhort, till love has got the maſtery, he remains almoſt always un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known. He ſoon diſcovered himſelf to me in all his power; and the diſorder, which the preſence of the count always threw me into, made me ſenſible of my defeat.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:047094_0028_1022AA63A89655C8"/>
About that time all my misfortunes came ſhower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon me, and, as I have told you, I loſt my huſband and brother. It was the moſt complete and ſtrongeſt felt diſtreſs in the world. My friend, who often came to comfort me, uſed to bring the count with her at a time when I ſaw no body; and I found, to the ſhame of my grief, that he alone was able to ſuſpend it.</p>
            <p>I was afterwards plunged into a world of affairs; my family ruined; my brother periſhing with all the infamy of guilt and rebellion, and none but I to aſſiſt him, and ſave all I could out of the ruins of the family. I was in hopes that ſo many trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles would at leaſt wear out the ſentiment I nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in my heart, but my misfortunes ever kept up a ſtrong remembrance of it.</p>
            <p>After many years vexation, time, without the help of reaſon, effected what the latter had not been able to compaſs; for we muſt own, to the ſhame of our affliction, that it doth not laſt forever. In ſhort, having made the moſt of the wrecks of my fortune, I hoped to enjoy a little quiet. But I had loſt the repoſe of the heart, and, when reſtored to myſelf, I found I was wholly ſunk in love. An active hurrying life had, indeed, encroached on its rights; but I have paid dear for it ſince. I could no longer miſtake my ſituation; I was forced to own it, and begin to ſettle with myſelf.</p>
            <p>Moſt women, void of thought or deſign of action, are hurried away by the firſt ſentiment that pleaſes them. But for my part I conſidered what I had to do, and, after weighing the count's character and my own, found that I muſt abſolutely avoid him: and, to ſhow you that my reſolution was grounded on knowledge, I will draw you his pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.—But no: I am not in a condition to paint him ſuch as he is. Love would needs conduct the
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:047094_0029_1022AA611739EC40"/>
pencil, and I could not ſuffer any want of merit in the object of my affections.</p>
            <p>But, ſaid I, interrupting her, how is it poſſible that with a heart, overflowing with ſo great a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, you ſhould have made no attempts towards ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſpiring the ſame in his, or expreſſing your own to him?—I have my anſwer ready, replied ſhe.</p>
            <p>I was born with a heart greatly ſuſceptible of tenderneſs, but yet at the ſame time with a deal of pride. The one cannot be gratified but at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe of the other. To make me happy, they ought both to agree, which is a difficult matter; and my condition is ſtill more miſerable when my glory is wounded, than when my heart bleeds; and I have therefore reſolved to gratify it. Had I ſhown my ſentiments, and they been ſlighted, I ſhould have died with grief; and that was my reaſon for avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him. I was ſure of my lips, but could not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for my eyes; and yet, whilſt I was ſhunning his looks, I was ever ſeeking for them. What ſtorm would they not raiſe in my ſoul, when my eyes happened to glance on him! My tenderneſs and pride always ſtepped in between him and me. The one forced me towards him, the other with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held my fondneſs; and theſe different impreſſions gave me a confuſed and baſhful air, which I was afraid might betray me. Yet there is not one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my life, wherein my heart doth not require, and I refuſe him to its eager deſires. My ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are as violent now, as when new; and more than once an increaſe of tenderneſs has exhauſted the whole ſtock of courage I had collected by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection. My thoughts are ſtill on him without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion. He falls in between every object and me; in all the projects I form, I have him ſtill in view: I fancy his eſteem is to be the reward of all the good I do, and I prize it yet more than all the
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:047094_0030_1022AA65336E07E8"/>
tender ſentiments I am able to ſuppoſe in him. I have ſet myſelf the hardeſt taſk in the world, a ſtrictneſs of behaviour that denies me even the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of imagination; but eſpecially, I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to avoid him, and accordingly keep my word with myſelf.</p>
            <p>One heart alone is unequal to ſo mighty a ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle; and a friend who viſited me often, ſeeing me penſive and melancholy, at laſt wreſted my ſecret from me. The confeſſion coſt me as much as if it had been ſomething criminal. He endeavoured to quiet my timorouſneſs, and ſaid—Do you think we owe as much fidelity to this whim of honour im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by cuſtom, as to the other which is the real attendant of virtue? Believe me, madam, the world is not too hard, you owe it but the appearances of decorum, no more is required of you.—I cannot be of your way of thinking, anſwered I, and I have never met with a woman good for any thing, after once throwing off the prejudice of honour. Be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſides, I have more regard for myſelf than for the world: I ſtand in need of my own good opinion, and the teſtimony of my conſcience is more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to me, than all the ſuffrages of the public.—But will you, ſaid he again, fall a ſacrifice to your paſſion? You muſt either get the better of, or yield to it.—If my heart could have obeyed me, replied I, I ſhould have got rid of it long ago, but I can bring it to no manner of terms. Nay, ſcarce can I forgive my ſenſibility, and it is you that have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called me to the attention I owe myſelf.</p>
            <p>But after all, madam, an inclination is not a thing that depends on us; it inſinuates into our hearts without our leave: paſſions ſeize and hold us in their power as long as they pleaſe, and the whole guilt lies in the uſe we make of them. What
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:047094_0031_1022AA69E7BB95C8"/>
have I not done to tear him from my heart? I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to leave my native country, and go over to a foreign court. I thought change of place and objects, might give a new turn to my ideas; but love, more diligent than me, flew and overtook me on the road. Seeing therefore, that all my precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were uſeleſs, and my affairs requiring my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence at home, I returned back. Next I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to force myſelf into a liking to ſome perſons that made their addreſſes to me, hoping to weaken one paſſion by another, and thus at laſt to give them both the ſlip. But alas! all to no purpoſe. I have ſacrificed every thing to my imaginary love, and my fidelity to this phantaſm of a paſſion, is proof againſt all. It is really wonderful what lengths I have gone with this mere idea. I have perſonalized it, ſo that I keep a ſocial intercourſe with it; nay, we have our quarrels and reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: at other times again we are upon eaſier terms, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, my melancholy being then more ſoothing, I <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>uld not barter it for the higheſt gratifications of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>eaſure. It is love alone that can give thoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>earing fits of ſadneſs which we enjoy with thanks. My ideas are ſo ſtrong, that there are moments when I fancy him near me, and love wears away the whole ſpace that ſeparates us.</p>
            <p>Would you know what has led me to this exceſs of paſſion? It is my extreme ſeverity to myſelf.—It is not thoſe that yield, who love moſt, but thoſe who reſiſt. All you deny the ſenſes, adds to the hoard of tenderneſs. I was let looſe to the exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerations of my mind, and, as poſſeſſion ſeldom furniſhes all the gratifications our deſires lend it, I have loved not in proportion to the merit I have found, but to that which I imagined.</p>
            <p>I heard much, about that time, that the count had an affair with a lady; a new addition to my
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:047094_0032_1022AA6B7232D480"/>
grief, My paſſion, I fancied, gave me a right over his. When we love dearly, we would fain be loved again, and always fancy ourſelves worthy of ſuch a return. I was as much piqued at his amour, as if he had really been guilty of an infidelity to me, and his affection for another raiſed a barrier be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and me. From his engagement he ſhifted to another. From thence I fancied he was inconſtant, and neither ſerious nor reſpectful of love, and I found I was doomed to the laborious taſk of effacing from my heart a ſentiment that was deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engraven in it. But alas! even now, a hundred times a day I ſay I will forget him, and ſay it, but to think ſtill more of him. What muſt I do with the vaſt ſtock of love thus ſwelling in my heart?—Lovers are often cured by reflections; but mine diſtemper me the more, and reaſon is too weak to aſſiſt me againſt my paſſion.—But it is too much expatiating upon what I feel. What, madam, muſt you now think of me? Or what impreſſions does my madneſs make upon you?—Think! replied I, why, that it is a ſort of conſolation to find ſo eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable a perſon as you, in ſome ſhape, partaking of my weakneſs.—</p>
            <p>After all this, now ſuffer me, madam, reſumed ſhe, to do my office, (for it is what we muſt do ſometimes) by deſiring you to conſider, that, though I have not fallen into the greateſt precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of love, I have nevertheleſs been exceſſively miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable. From a conduct tolerably laudable, what advantages have I reaped? Myſelf the only wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſo many difficulties and ſtrugglings. In love every thing of this nature is loſt, becauſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, beſides that the heart is never well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed again after having been once agitated with that paſſion. How amiable and deſirable is virtue, even barely with regard to our repoſe! Take the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:047094_0033_1022AA6E08595FF8"/>
moſt fortunate paſſions, and ſum up, if poſſible, all the alarms, the pangs, the anxieties, the fears, the jealouſies that attend them: lay all theſe aſide, and leave to love none but its pure joys; how few will they appear? Yet, for the ſhadow of theſe few pleaſures, we vitiate our taſte, and loſe the reliſh of true pleaſures for all our lives. Pardon, madam, this ſmall touch of morality. If, by laying myſelf open to you as I have now done, I have forfeited the privilege of giving advice, I hope by a mutual confidence to regain a new right to your heart, and make myſelf believed a friend free from ſuſpicion.</p>
            <p>Here I was going, in return, to unboſom my ſoul to her, in full liberty, in regard to my ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when we were told that my father wanted us. Having waited on him, he aſked me in a rough angry tone, what I had done to prince Camillus? "His mother has been telling me this moment, continued he, that he grieves moſt terribly, and you are taxed with being the cauſe of it: it is very cutting, ſays ſhe to me, firſt to bear ſo much againſt my will, my ſon's paſſion for your daughter, and then to find that very paſſion ſerves but to make him unhappy. I believe you too much my friend, not to join with me in breaking an engagement which is not at all agreeable to me, and you are too much a man of honour not to think rather of ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling the duties of gratitude, than of aggrandizing your family at the expenſe of the friendſhip you owe me. Since, therefore, your daughter helps us by her ill-treatment of my ſon, let us, concluded ſhe, complete a rupture, which we durſt not have attempted without her concurrence; and for this purpoſe I beg of you to carry, or ſend her down into the country. I anſwered, that I deſired her to be perſuaded that no intereſts were dearer to me than her own; that I had nothing more at heart
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:047094_0034_1022AA7096A69D50"/>
than to give her ſatisfaction, and that I ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately order you away. Therefore, Mademoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle, get yourſelf ready to ſet out for my country ſeat in two or three days. The gratitude and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity I owe the princeſs prevent my talking to you in the ſtrain of an offended father, but I had rather ſerve her than you. Certainly, purſued he, turning to Leonora, who had followed me, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can come up to my daughter's ingratitude to an amiable prince, who has a violent paſſion for her, who ſacrifices the greateſt advantages to his love, and is the ſupport of our tottering family. When the princeſs, his mother, out of indulgence to him and kind regard to me, is going to give a conſent which coſts her ſo much, ſhe, my daughter, alone raiſes an obſtacle to an affair, which the ought to buy at the expenſe of half her life!—Oh! in ſpite of reſolution, I ſhall loſe my temper, anger reſumes its rights, and will have vent! Begone, and never more appear in my ſight." I would have anſwered, but he was too much exaſperated, and I found the beſt way was to withdraw imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to my chamber. Leonora ſtaid however ſome time behind, to try to pacify him, but his paſſion ran ſo high, and his rage was ſo violent, that ſhe found it a hard matter to calm him.</p>
            <p>That very moment the prince came to pay him a viſit, and finding him prodigiouſly ruffled, aſked him the reaſon of his diſcompoſure: "My daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, replied the old gentleman, has been unhappy enough to diſpleaſe you, for which I cannot pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh her too much, and therefore have juſt now or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered her away into the country." The prince immediately threw himſelf at his feet to beg I might be allowed to ſtay, but my father replied, that his word was too ſtrongly engaged to the princeſs ever to go from it. The prince aſſured
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:047094_0035_1022AA736831DB20"/>
him I was no ways guilty: "Muſt parents, ſaid he, interfere in the quarrels of lovers, which have often no other foundation but their delicacy? It is I, ſir, that am in fault. Love is never ſatisfied, and often unjuſt. But at leaſt give me leave to ſee your daughter.—You have it, my lord, replied my father.—Well, then, continued the prince, I will go to my mother, and entreat her to deſire you herſelf to break off this cruel journey.—Were ſhe even to order it, anſwered my father, it would be all to no purpoſe. She might think you and I are of a party in it; and I owe more to my honour than to any conſideration whatever."</p>
            <p>Leonora had withdrawn, when ſhe ſaw the prince enter my father's cloſet, though not ſo far but ſhe overheard this part of their converſation, after which ſhe came up to my room, where ſhe found me ſinking under a dejection of ſpirits that cannot be expreſſed. "O my dear, cried I, my father's anger diſtracts me; but what afflicts me moſt is, that he is not angry without a cauſe. Alas! but a moment ago you were talking of the trials of love: could I have thought I was deſtined to be ſo ſoon an inſtance of them?" Leonora on this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated to me what the prince had ſaid to my father, but his generoſity and virtue ſerved only to add to my guilt and affliction.</p>
            <p>The prince that moment entered my room, and finding me drowned in tears;—Though I am ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the cauſe of thoſe tears, ſaid he, and dare not flatter myſelf they are meant for me, yet, madam, you are afflicted, and that is a ſufficient motive for me to partake in your ſorrow.—My lord, replied I, abandon a wretched creature that diſturbs the tranquillity of your family: do not add your conſtancy to my load of misfortunes. You have already done too much for me and it is time

to think of yourſelf, and what you owe the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs your mother.—Why will you, madam, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he, ever take upon you the care of my duty? It no longer becomes you to affect ſuch a generoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity. This laſt ſpeech offended me.—What, ſir, do you mean by this, ſaid I, and what am I accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of?—I accuſe you of nothing, replied the prince, and you will never find a perſecutor in me. In the piques of lovers, the delicacy of the perſon in fault is always ſufficient revenge to the injured; I aſk no other: but at leaſt, Mademoiſelle, help us not to loſe you. I have not been able to prevail with your father. It is the firſt time in my life I have ſeen him angry with you, and I muſt die with grief, if he continues much longer in the ſame temper.</p>
            <p>Here I was told that one of the princeſs Flavia's gentlemen wanted to ſpeak with me. He brought me word that her highneſs had engaged me for a party of hunting the next day. I deſired Leonora to go and know my father's pleaſure what I muſt do. His anſwer was—To be ſure ſhe muſt obey the princeſs: ſince ſhe has done her the honour to name her for the party, ſhe ought to go.—I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſent the gentleman back with my thanks to the princeſs, and to aſſure her I would not fail to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with her orders.</p>
            <p>I was now obliged to get my things ready and think of my dreſs, but indeed I was very little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for joy. One of the inconveniencies of a court is, that we muſt have the ſentiments that reign there, or do as if we had them; ſo that, of ten under an outward appearance of mirth, the inward anguiſh of the heart is concealed.</p>
            <p>I joined the company the next day—a very heavy heart, but diſſembled my uneaſineſs by ſaying I had had a violent head-ache. Nothing in the world could be more gallant than our hunting match,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:047094_0037_1022AA788F1A6CB0"/>
which was to conclude with an entertainment at a pleaſure ſeat in the country. The ladies made a very fine appearance on horſeback. My father, who neglected nothing that could give an addition of graces to my perſon, had made me learn to ride, and my dreſs was blue, trimmed with gold. I was liked better than I could have wiſhed, and the princeſs, who was very obliging, complimented me upon it in the handſomeſt manner in the world.—The firſt perſons my eyes glanced on were the prince and the duke, very regularly paying their court to her highneſs. My confuſion was inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible: I was at a loſs how to diſpoſe of my looks; the prince was obſerving me, and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed my diſorder.</p>
            <p>The chace began at laſt, and the duke contrived means to get near me. When he came up, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed ſo much uneaſineſs at his ſight, that he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew very reſpectfully, ſaying, I hope, then, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, you will take for done, all the ſervices I do not render you.</p>
            <p>When the ſport was over, the company repaired to a country ſeat, which was finely illuminated; and, as ſoon as they arrived, the ladies withdrew to the apartments prepared for them, in order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh themſelves, and ſhift their dreſſes. Here, pulling out my handkerchief, I found a letter in my pocket, without being able to know how it came there; and, juſt as I was reading it, the prince ſtepped into my chamber. I hid it in a great hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but he perceived my confuſion, and ſaid to me, I find, madam, I am troubleſome, and ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore withdraw. The time was now come for my evil deſtiny to prevail over my life.</p>
            <p>When I had changed cloaths, I was obliged to go down to the company. How difficult a matter it is to put on a pleaſant air with a bleeding heart!
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:047094_0038_1022AA7A19AAD8B8"/>
In the courſe of the converſation I told the princeſs I was going down into the country. She aſked me upon what account; I replied, my father was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſpend a few weeks of the ſpring at his ſeat, and aſſured her I ſhould carry with me the moſt grateful ſenſe of the obligations I lay under to her goodneſs. She inquired likewiſe how far the houſe might be; and upon my telling her that it was but two or three leagues off, ſhe had the complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance to promiſe to come down and ſee me. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived all theſe marks of diſtinction as I ought.—The duke was preſent when I mentioned my jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and ſeemed to expreſs a concern. But as for the prince, he did not appear the whole evening, which gave me much uneaſineſs. The company went to cards; there was alſo a concert in the drawing-room, whither I followed the princeſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I found my account better with the muſic: for there I had nothing to do but feel and be ſilent. Supper was ſerved up; every thing was in the moſt magnificent taſte; and there was a grand ball after.</p>
            <p>The duke made the moſt brilliant and graceful appearance in the world at this entertainment, and I own I found myſelf poſſeſſed with quite new ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, which I perceived very well were thoſe the prince had been ſo long requiring of me in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, but which till then I had been utterly unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with. Though I was very ſorry not to ſee him, becauſe his abſence was a ſure ſign of his diſcontent. Yet I could not help finding myſelf more at caſe for a moment: my looks and ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments had a greater liberty of action, and I ſaw with ſorrow, though not without a mixture of joy, the moſt violent paſſion written in the duke's eyes. Whenever I happened to be his partner, he was thought to dance better than uſual, and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:047094_0039_1022AA7EC8078EA8"/>
made us repeat together ſeveral dances, which ſhe fancied we performed better than the reſt.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, he was endeavouring to pleaſe, and was, perhaps, very ſenſible that he did ſo.</p>
            <p>After the ball was over, I hurried home to my apartment, whither Leonora, who had been ſo kind as to keep always with me, alſo followed. As ſoon as I ſaw her, I ordered my maids to retire, and then ſhe began to tell me, how dearly I was like to pay for the moment's pleaſure I had had. I gave her an account of all that had paſſed, but ſhe knew it better than myſelf, having obſerved me all the time. I ſhowed her the letter I had received, and told her how the prince had ſurprized me reading it, and that no doubt he ſuſpected it came from the duke of Praxede. Indeed, anſwered ſhe, you are to be pitied, madam; but what can be done for you? We ſpent part of the night in conſulting upon the different methods I could take, but day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light appearing before we could fix on any, we went to our beds unreſolved.</p>
            <p>The prince called upon Leonora betimes in the morning: It is perhaps ill-mannerly, madam, ſaid he, to come ſo early to diſturb people that go to bed by day-light. He had, it ſeems, paſſed the night on a terrace that lay under my window, and had ſeen how late we had ſat up together; he knew alſo all that had happened at the ball, having been preſent in diſguiſe. He expreſſed a lively and deep concern to Leonora, telling her how he had caught me reading a letter, which upon ſight of him, I had put up with a diſorder that had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed me, and, upon my friend's endeavouring to diſſuade him from the notions he had formed of that letter, he anſwered, I do not ſeek to accuſe her, and ſhould be very ſorry to have any cauſe to do it. Alas! far from it: ſo great was my good
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:047094_0039_1022AA7EC8078EA8"/>
opinion of her ſincerity, that ſhe might have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted any thing upon the ſtrength of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence.—What then is it you complain of, replied Leonora, what hath ſhe done more than common civility required? (for, as to the letter affair, ſhe made him believe he was miſtaken, and folks in love are eaſily deceived). I cannot, anſwered he, ground either my ſuſpicions, or even my diſcontent, on any thing certain; but a ſecret foreboding diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbs my heart: my fears are not quieted by her love, and, when ſhe is with the duke, methinks I ſee in her eyes a ſomething ſhe never hath with me. Leonora was not wanting in her endeavours to calm thoſe apprehenſions. He begged her to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain leave of my father to viſit me in the country, and aſſured her at parting, that his ſuſpicions and uneaſineſſes on my account ſhould never reach him, and that he would owe nothing to paternal author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, nor accept of my hand if my heart did not tender it.</p>
            <p>The prince having obtained the liberty he deſired, I ſat out without daring to take leave of my father, and under his diſpleaſure I found myſelf more eaſy in the country. Our ſeat was a noble building, though not in the modern taſte: there was a large park, fine woods, and pleaſant water. Nature ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every where at liberty, without being forced by art. I was in hopes that the calm tranquillity that reigned in this place might diffuſe itſelf into my ſoul: but, alas! the paſſions delight in ſilence, they increaſe and ſtrengthen by ſolitude. I found myſelf with diſpoſitions till then unknown, and in a diſorder and agitation, which nevertheleſs had a ſecret charm.</p>
            <p>Leonora often intruded upon my ſolitary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to rouze me out of my reveries, and oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly reproach me with ſhunning her. Then, ſaid I,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:047094_0041_1022AA82DD4001B0"/>
I muſt alſo ſhun myſelf, for you are my ſole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. But the truth is, that all my time is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to beſtow on what I feel of late.—Your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, anſwered ſhe, might be better employed on the misfortunes love has in ſtore for you. I know my advices will be in vain againſt a growing paſſion, but, though uſeleſs, I ſtill owe them to you: conſider, madam, continued ſhe, that you are wanting to every thing that is moſt ſacred, to your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to your father, and what is ſtill more, to the moſt lovely prince in the world, and to the trueſt and beſt proved paſſion that ever was; and for whom? For one you do not know, and who will moſt aſſuredly render your life miſerable. You muſt not fancy, that all paſſions carry their excuſes with them.—Here we were interrupted and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I was very ſenſible ſhe was in the right, but her reaſon and mine were both too weak to help me. She was threatening me with misfortunes, and troubling my life, without effectually arming me againſt my evil deſtiny.</p>
            <p>I do not know by what enchantment every thing about me ſerved the duke. I cannot tell whether he had bribed any of my people, but I met with marks of his paſſion in every place. Once I found a letter on my toilet; at other times verſes would be offered to my view in the woods and moſt bye places, whither I liked to retire. Here is the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I have ſpoken of. At firſt I made a ſcruple of unfolding it; and, had it been poſſible, would have ſent it back whence it came, unopened: but we can hardly deny ourſelves a pleaſure that preſents itſelf, and the receiving of which is to be unknown. I therefore opened it, and read theſe words:</p>
            <p>"I tremble, Mademoiſelle, to appear before you, and am under a dread of your diſpleaſure; yet what makes my crime, ought to be my excuſe—I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:047094_0042_1022AA8468217000"/>
forbear telling you that you have taught me to love, without knowing yourſelf thoſe tender ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments you have taught me. Though, were you to judge of yourſelf only by the paſſion you have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired in me, you could not be ignorant that you are the moſt adorable creature in the world. But by the infinite ſenſe I have of your worth, methinks I am ſtill placing you at a greater diſtance from me. I have a love and reſpect which you only can inſpire, and which no one but myſelf is capable of feeling."</p>
            <p>The next day as I was going to ſit down by a large canal in a grove, I found this other letter on a ſeat of green turf, on which I uſed to reſt myſelf.</p>
            <p>"You need not be under any fear on my account, Mademoiſelle. The ſentiments you have raiſed in me have all the warmth of paſſion, with the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of virtue. I dare glory in the avowing them, and will believe I have no other merit but what is derived from them. Let the diſintereſtedneſs of my affection plead in its behalf; ſince there can be no greater proof of love, than to be more eager to love than to be loved again. For my part, I am rewarded for my paſſion by what I feel, and am pleaſed with the expectation of happier days:—Judge, then, madam, if I can ever fail of honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and reſpecting you."</p>
            <p>Another day this third billet was offered to my view in a cloſet, whither I uſed to retire.</p>
            <p>"I paſs the days and nights under your walls, and, though I cannot live from the place that holds my bliſs, I know not how to approach; all the ways that lead to my charmer appear full of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties. But even this becomes an advantage, ſince finding you at laſt, muſt claim ſome merit.—I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not return to court; I have not power to diſcharge my duty there:—and think, wherever you are not,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:047094_0043_1022AA8901662F50"/>
I am obliged to no duty but that of regretting your abſence. Much leſs can I ſeek for pleaſure. Can any be found without you? I find at leaſt there is none for me in the world but where you are. In you alone, love has centered all my hopes, my wiſhes, and my pleaſures.—Will you not then, through pity, relieve what I ſuffer through love?"</p>
            <p>Thus every thing ſpoke in his behalf, and was ever reminding me of what I could not forget. I believed eaſily the agreeable truths that cloſed with my deſires. He was by degrees uſing me to hear him talk of his paſſion, and inſenſibly gaining upon my delicacy and baſhfulneſs, whilſt I allowed and forgave my loving him.</p>
            <p>A few days after my arrival in the country, the counteſs Emilia came to ſee me. She was a friend of the family's, and had always expreſſed a high friendſhip for me. She brought with her a very amiable daughter, who, after the firſt acquaintance, obſerving that I was alone, and might be glad of company, offered very kindly to ſtay behind with me, if I would but aſk her mamma leave. At any other time I ſhould have been very glad of ſuch an offer, but I was now ſo melancholy, and ſo much taken up with my paſſion, that, though ſometimes I endeavoured to divert my thoughts, I ſtill fell into my old way, and my tenderneſs made me believe that I owed myſelf wholly and entirely to my ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of love, and that to deviate from them was no better than an infidelity. However, I could not well decline aſking her of her mother, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made the propoſal, which ſhe readily came into.</p>
            <p>I diverted my new companion as well as I could. We ſoon contracted a familiarity with one another, and yet ſhe was not open with me, but ſeemed rath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er penſive and taken up with ſomething at heart.
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:047094_0044_1022AA8B929EC4F8"/>
I did not chooſe to let her know I perceived it, for fear of giving her uneaſineſs, nor preſs to be let in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her ſecrets, becauſe I was glad her reſervedneſs towards, gave me a right of behaving in the ſame manner to her. She would often be alone, which pleaſed me much, as I had thereby the liberty and opportunity of being ſo too.</p>
            <p>Going one day into her apartments, I was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurprized to find the duke with her, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they both perceived the diſorder his preſence threw me into. At firſt I had a great mind to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it, but contained myſelf upon reflection, that, not being acquainted with the ſecret of my heart, ſhe could mean no harm in introducing the duke. I could not hinder her from ſeeing her friends at my houſe, and the duke, knowing nothing of what I had ſuffered upon his account, could have no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of diſobliging me by a viſit to a lady of his acquaintance. Theſe reaſons calmed my reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.—I made but a ſhort ſtay with them, and ran immediately after to Leonora. I told her I had juſt ſeen the duke in my friend's apartment, and what concern it gave me, leſt my father and the prince ſhould think I had an hand in it, begging her to tell me what I had beſt do. She knew me too well to ſuſpect any artifice in my conduct. My fears anſwered for me; and ſhe knew I could feel, but that was all. She therefore told me ſhe would wait on my father with an account of the whole of the matter, and would take his orders how to act, but that ſhe was pretty ſure he would ſuſpect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing further.</p>
            <p>It fell out accordingly. He was perſuaded that it was a mere chance accident, and, that as it was not poſſible to turn out of doors a young lady of my friend's quality, ſo was it likewiſe impoſſible to prevent her receiving what viſits ſhe pleaſed in her
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:047094_0045_1022AA8D1B311328"/>
apartment; but he deſired her never to be one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from me. They agreed alſo that he ſhould now and then take a trip down to us, to conceal from the world the knowledge of my diſgrace with him, and prevent people's talk about it to my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage.</p>
            <p>Leonora's return made me eaſy as to my father, but I was certain all our precautions would avail nothing with the prince, and that he wou'd not hearken to reaſon like the old gentleman. Going into my room, I found a letter laid upon a couch, and indeed few days paſſed without my receiving ſome, one way or another. I opened it, and read theſe words:</p>
            <p>"I appear no more at court, Mademoiſelle, out of regard for my love. I cannot help thinking my paſſion is legible in my eyes, and by looking at me I fancy every body can diſcover that you are the perſon I adore.—What! muſt I make a ſecret of loving you? The only merit I would boaſt of is a high ſenſe of your value, and a reſpect equal to your worth.—My ſentiments, madam, want only to be felt, and I words to expreſs them."</p>
            <p>Ever after I avoided going into my friend's apartment, but ſhe was fonder of my company than ever. You ſhun me, ſaid ſhe, one day, you have found out the duke's inclination to you, and fancy me deep in ſome plot againſt you; but do me the juſtice to believe, that though he is very much my friend, I am incapable of acting any part unworthy of you, or myſelf.—But, ſaid I, where did you get acquainted with this man, for I am ſure I have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeen him at your houſe!—I have known him a long while, replied ſhe, and the reaſon of your not ſeeing him was, becauſe he was at the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> at the time you <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> us. I became acquainted with him at the marchioneſs * * *, and ſhall one day or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:047094_0046_1022AA8EA5B9FD50"/>
tell you the hiſtory of our friendſhip; but at preſent give me leave to inform you, that he feels the ſtrongeſt paſſion for you. What part therefore will you have me act? Will you not take it amiſs if I receive his profeſſions to deliver them to you? Tell me how I can ſerve you. If this doth not pleaſe you, and his love is offenſive, I will have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more to ſay to him. My friend was much too hard for me. She wanted to know the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of my ſoul, and people in love are apt to be communicative, for theſe two ſentiments always go hand in hand. Beſides, ſhe was a ſiſter perſon to make a confidante of, than Leonora, our ages agreeing better with one another. I therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſomed my ſoul, and told her my ſecret upon honour not to mention a word of it to the duke, which ſhe promiſed, and I am willing to believe ſhe has kept her word with me. I informed her without reſerve of all I have related to you: my ſtory ſurprized and affected her much, and ſhe gave me new aſſurances of doing nothing but what I ſhould think ſit.</p>
            <p>The next day we took a walk at a ſmall diſtance from our ſeat. It was a very fine place. Whilſt we were abroad, prince Camillus came to pay us a viſit, but was told I was gone out. He thought, I ſuppoſe, that in the country one was always to be met with at home, and could not conceive, that having ſo large and fine a park, we ſhould go to ſeek a walk abroad. Yet, had he thought proper, he might have been ſatisfied of the truth. If he had but aſked the ſervants, they could have told him, where I was. But, without making the leaſt inquiry he went away in a paſſion, and the next day ſent me the following letter.</p>
            <p>"Love led me yeſterday to your ſolitude. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoiſelle, but even Capid <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> met with a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment.
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:047094_0047_1022AA938118CAD0"/>
I found nothing but a melancholy ſolitude, every thing that could pleaſe was fled with you. However, do not fear that my complaints ſhall ever more come to diſturb your pleaſures. No; I value them as your's: though I cannot taſte any, where you are abſent, may you ſtill partake of a great deal where I am far off; proofs of love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come offenſive when we are not in a diſpoſition to make them a return."</p>
            <p>That very evening we took a walk by ourſelves; my friend made me vaſt proteſtations of friendſhip, and ſpoke with great ſenſibility of all I had men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to her. Our converſation was long and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but at laſt it grew late, and we were obliged to return homewards.</p>
            <p>As we were walking back to the caſtle, I heard a noiſe near me, and was mightily ſurprized to find myſelf ſtopped by ſomebody that lay at my feet.—I gave a ſhriek, upon which a voice, which I ſoon knew for the duke's, ſaid—Do not be frightened, madam, I am no enemy.—Yes, ſir, anſwered I, you muſt be one, cruelly thus to expoſe me.—You will not be expoſed, replied he; nobody can know I am here, and your reputation is dearer to me than my paſſion: but what can I do with the mighty ſtore of love you have inſpired me with?—I now turned to my friend, and aſked whether ſhe had a hand in this piece of treachery?—No, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, anſwered he for her, ſhe has no manner of ſhare in what I do, and it is from the innocence and purity of my ſentiments alone I have borrowed this preſumption. He then threw himſelf again at my feet, and ſaid the moſt paſſionate things in the world. I would have got from him, and called my friend, but could not ſtir, ſomething inviſible, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, too prevailing, ſeized my ſoul, and my legs refuſed to perform their office. Fortunately I had
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:047094_0048_1022AA950CEEC2B0"/>
not power to ſpeak, and therefore only anſwered him with my heart, but my eyes would eaſily have betrayed their meaning, could he have ſeen them. In ſhort, he perſuaded me of his paſſion. Heavens! what did he not ſay, and how did it not affect me? But, at laſt, my friend informing us that day-light was approaching, and that we muſt part, he aſked leave to return again the next day. I had not power to deny him, and withdrew in a diſorder and agitation that cannot be expreſſed.</p>
            <p>I paſſed the remainder of the night awake, and was never taken up with ſuch a variety of ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: for joy, grief, hopes, fear, and remorſe, took their turns, and raiſed ſuch a ſtorm in my breaſt, that day appeared before ſleep could approach my eyelids.</p>
            <p>I went very early to my friend's apartment, and finding her penſive and ſorrowful, enquired into the reaſon. I ſhall be loth to tell it you, anſwered ſhe, but yet I cannot betray the confidence you repoſe in me, and ſhould think myſelf wanting in my obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to you, if I did not acquaint you with the duke's engagements. What! cried I, has he then placed his affections elſewhere? Perhaps that is all over, replied ſhe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you are capable of effacing the deepeſt impreſſions; but, however, hear me out if you can: I am going to reveal to you his ſecret and my own.—Sure, ſaid I, it is not you that he is in love with?—No, madam, replied ſhe haſtily, compoſe yourſelf and hear me; for you muſt know the bottom, in order to take the courſe that can ſit you beſt.</p>
            <p>I have known the duke ſome time. He was ſomewhat forward in courting an acquaintance with me, and got one of my relations to introduce him. I was aſtoniſhed that a man of his youth, and ſo taken up with gay pleaſures, ſhould come to ſeek a
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:047094_0049_1022AA9797D132D0"/>
perſon much retired, and who thought more of leading a rational life, than one diverſified with mirth and gaiety. I enquired therefore into his views, and ſelf-love made me believe, that, not being a bad match as to fortune, they might relate to me. But I was not long in that error. You know there's a friendſhip between madam L* * * and me. She is very amiable. I ſuſpected his aſſiduity at our houſe might be meant for her, and accordingly, by often talking to him about her, and telling him all the handſome things I could think of her, I was ſoon convinced that his fondneſs was all intended for that friend. The diſcovery nettled me a little; I avoided ſome time enquiring why, and my heart would fain have ſpared me an inſight into my weakneſs; but, as I feared its ſurprizes, I was not deceived, and thought I muſt apply the neceſſary remedies.</p>
            <p>At firſt I made a reſolution never to ſee him more. Alas! it would have proved more for my ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, had I followed this, than the conduct I after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards impoſed upon myſelf.</p>
            <p>Indeed, fancying I could do ſtill better, I ſet about wreſting his ſecret from him, and was even at the advance of the whole expenſe of the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, by telling him the misfortune I had had to loſe the Marquis * * *, with whom my family had entered into ſome engagements relating to a match between us; how ſenſibly I had been affected with the breaking off of the intended alliance; with what regret I forbid him my doors, when decency and the commands of my relations would no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger allow of his viſits; how much this conduct in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed my paſſion; and how I found by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that ſeverity ſerves love, and ſtrengthens the impreſſion. I made him this confidence, with a view of placing an eternal obſtacle between him and
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:047094_0050_1022AA9923CCF678"/>
my own heart. I likewiſe gave by this a pretence and excuſe to my ſorrow, and aſcribed to another, the effects of my paſſion for him.</p>
            <p>This confidence diſpleaſed him; whether it was contrary to his deſigns, or that his vanity had been flattered with the belief that my heart inclined to him; but yet I thought I perceived he had ſome ſecret views, and would have it in his power to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt me when he ſhould think fit.—It is pretty much the way of the men to have ſome object in reſerve, after letting their imaginations rove, and loſing their taſte for their preſent pleaſures.</p>
            <p>My confidence had quite a contrary effect to what I imagined, for he became eager and fond.—He was inconſolable, as he ſaid, at my having ſuch ſentiments for another; and when I told him, that it took nothing from him, he thought me guilty of want of delicacy in not underſtanding there were paſſions of eſteem infinitely above thoſe of the ſenſes. The truth was, I wanted no other from him, but the difficulty lay in convincing me that his was of that kind. Whatever he could ſay, I did not believe him the more for it, and there were even ſome moments when I eſteemed him the leſs on that account. He continued always in the ſame ſtrain, and, had I been willing to flatter my ſelf-love, I might have believed that I had inſpired him with a very ſublime paſſion. But this did not ſatisfy me; I wanted to come to ſome concluſion, and fix my ſituation by his.</p>
            <p>Many ways offered to that end. I was miſtreſs of his ſecret. He had intruſted me with his repoſe, had deſired me to direct him; and I could without treachery, act a part conſiſtent with my intereſt, by refuſing to ſerve him in his amour. Another would have taken the opportunity to be revenged of the
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:047094_0051_1022AA9B0C3054B0"/>
preference given to a rival, and nothing was eaſier than this, for my friend was timorous; ſhe was afraid of the world and her family; ſhe feared the duke himſelf, and I had nothing to do but to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge her in her own way.</p>
            <p>A more worthy conduct, however, preſented itſelf at the ſame time. I kept off all the low reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we women are ſuſceptible of. I examined his caſe and my own, and did not find him guilty in feeling for another, what I could have wiſhed he had felt for me. I thought it was my buſineſs to puniſh myſelf for a miſplaced affection, by turning it to his advantage, and that my affection ought to be pure and powerful enough to be aſſiſting in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him more happy in another. I laid aſide all my tenderneſs, and forgot my own intereſt, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to impoſe upon myſelf the moſt difficult conduct in the world, which, however, I have hitherto been able to keep up to. I fancied, that if he could be touched by an honourable behaviour, I ſhould thereby make a worthy friend of him; and that, however, if it was all loſt upon him, it would not be ſo for me. In ſhort, my deluded imagination has ſerved him ſo well, that it has been able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade me, that nothing would be more worthy of me than to conquer myſelf.</p>
            <p>I therefore ſet about advancing his intereſt with my friend, as if on their happineſs the whole of mine had depended. I ſpoke to lady L * * * of the great paſſion he had for her. I painted it in the ſtrongeſt colours, and drew a picture, ſketched by truth, but ornamented by love. My friend was ſomewhat prepoſſeſſed againſt him, but I found means to combat her prejudices. I calmed her fears; I anſwered for him; I took all upon myſelf; I touched her heart; I moved her inclination to tenderneſs, and relieved her modeſty. In ſhort,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:047094_0052_1022AAA1DA8AFF88"/>
when he came to ſee her, he had nothing to do, but to finiſh what I had ſo well begun. He found the impreſſion ready made to his hands.</p>
            <p>There were, indeed, ſome moments when I could not help thinking the part I had acted very much out of character. "I am wanting to every thing, ſaid I; I act againſt my own principles; I forget the regard I owe to myſelf, and know no other duty, but that of expreſſing my attachment to him. What a ſcene is this for indifferent people to ſee?"—Yet, when I conſulted my heart and affections, I thought there could be nothing greater than to give him up to another. I judged of the merit of my conduct by what it coſt me. Thus, without regard to myſelf, without the leaſt tender concern for my own ſituation, I have admitted no thought, but that of effecting his happineſs.</p>
            <p>There was a time when I hoped to enjoy the ſad comfort of ſeeing him no more: he ſeemed to have taken ſome diſguſt, and I adviſed him to break off with my friend and me. That was leſs cruel, in my opinion, than the laborious taſk I had taken upon me. Indeed I ſuſpected he was at this time in love with madam C * * * *, but he would not own it.</p>
            <p>In the mean while I was attentive to every thing that happened. I watched all his ſteps and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and was ready to magnify every fault he committed, through the deſire I had of finding him guilty; and indeed I was not in humour to invent excuſes for him.</p>
            <p>But, at laſt, after an eclairciſſement, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, and became fonder than ever of my friend. I now found how cutting it was to know the object of our affections attached to ſomething perfect; yet, far from allowing my intereſt to encroach on the juſtice I owed my friend, my delicacy, and fear
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:047094_0053_10224BFD9D43F950"/>
of being wanting to her, increaſed her merit with me. Ever ſince they admitted me into their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, I cannot reproach myſelf with having once thought of what would have been for my own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. All my advice has been ſincere, and has ſerved their intereſts againſt my own heart; ſo that the greateſt paſſion that ever was, has all along been ſubſervient to friendſhip. I have thought on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of conquering my inclinations, and puniſhing my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for a paſſion, which it was not in my power to ſuppreſs, ſince the heart involuntarily yields to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions.</p>
            <p>On a time, the duke would fain have perſuaded me he had changed his mind, and was always tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me things very much to my friend's diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. This loſt him my eſteem. He redoubled his complaiſance to me: when ſhe was preſent, he would ſeem fonder of me, than of her: he offered me a preference which might have flattered my vanity. He followed me in all places; he grew jealous of every thing that came near me, and his jealouſy was real, for he would have been very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to loſe me. But he conducted a paſſion and a deſign alike; a perſon leſs upon her guard might have miſtaken the one for the other, but my mind could ſee all his faults, though my heart was not yet ſenſible of them.—</p>
            <p>If I had not ſpoke, during this long narrative, it was becauſe I really had not power to do it; and my friend, quite intent upon her ſtory, had not taken notice of the condition I was in all the while. But now, unable to bear any longer, I gave a ſhrick, and cried out—It is enough. Oh! tell me no more;—and with that, the violent conſtraint I had put upon myſelf, having quite exhauſted my ſpirits, I ſunk down in a ſwoon, and was a long while in the arms of my women without recovering from
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:047094_0054_1022AAA506C4AE68"/>
my fit; but, to my misfortune, they recalled me at laſt to life.</p>
            <p>Scarce had I opened my eyes, and began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover my ſpirits, but a great noiſe and buſtle was heard about the houſe, and ſome of my maids left me to run and ſee what it might be. But as they did not return, and the loud cries continued, I leaned upon the arm of one of them, and ſtaggered towards the place from whence they proceeded.—Juſt as I got to the hall, I ſaw four men bringing in another bathed in his blood, whom, as he turned his head towards me, I knew to be the prince.—This ſight almoſt rivetted me to the ground; but, making an effort, I moved forwards to follow the mournful ſpectacle. They laid him on a couch in the parlour, and I made ſigns to the ſervants to run for help, for I could ſcarce ſpeak. The prince ſeeing me, turned his expiring eyes towards me, and ſaid—I have not been able to touch your heart, madam, nor convince you of my love: I ſhall, however, die contented, if in my laſt moments I can perſuade you that no one ever loved you ſo truly as I have, though a more happy man puts me in the condition I am now in.—At this inſtant the eyes of all preſent, who were not a few, flaſhed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me with indignation, but I was yet more hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to myſelf than to them; and Leonora, who came running at the noiſe, ſeeing my condition, dragged me away from this diſmal ſight.</p>
            <p>I was led up to my chamber. I begged of her, however, to go and take care of the prince, and to ſend away with all expedition for the ableſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons that could be got. They had already taken care of that, and as we were not at a great diſtance from town, they were not long in coming. They examined his wounds, and found them mortal.—I
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:047094_0055_1022AAA69C9D93A8"/>
ſent every moment to know his condition, but could ſee very well by the looks of my women that there was no hopes of him.</p>
            <p>My friend came at laſt, and, by the grief ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, I gueſſed the prince's condition.—It is the duke, ſaid ſhe to me, that has fought him.—Can you, anſwered I, be the bearer of ſuch cruel news!—Why, replied ſhe, you muſt be informed of what is become a public talk, that you may be able to regulate yourſelf accordingly.—Though ſhe was in the right, I could not help thinking her cruel to talk ſo; but grief is often unjuſt. I begged her to return to the prince's aſſiſtance, and not to leave him.</p>
            <p>I then withdrew to my cloſet, with one of my women, in whom I confided moſt, and, throwing myſelf on a couch, ſaid, "I have nothing more to do in this world, and yet am not allowed to bring death to my relief! What a cruelty to be obliged to ſupport life under ſuch circumſtances!—But, come; I have always depended upon your attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to me; follow me. I can no longer endure the ſight of human kind.—Whither, madam, muſt we go? replied ſhe.—No matter where, anſwered I, provided I avoid the eyes of all my acquaintance." The girl endeavoured to oppoſe my deſign, but to no purpoſe. I opened a door on the back ſtairs that led to the garden, and was going out, when ſhe ſtopped me, by telling me how improper it would be to go away with the cloaths I had on, and all my jewels about me, deſiring me to ſtay at leaſt till ſhe had dreſſed me in one of her plaineſt ſuite. I was perſuaded, and bid her make haſte, not being able to tarry a moment longer in this fatal houſe. "But, will you not wait the utmoſt of the prince's fate, reſumed ſhe again, and muſt not that, madam, regulate your deſtiny'"—Alas,
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:047094_0056_1022AAA9833D8F30"/>
anſwered I, doſt thou not hear the diſmal ſhricks of the whole family, too expreſſive of his not having one moment longer to live.</p>
            <p>Saying theſe words, I flew down ſtairs. We paſſed the garden without meeting any body, and got out by a back door that opened into a large wood. The day was beginning to cloſe: I walked ſome time without uttering a word: ſhame and fear ſunk all my ſpirits. At laſt, quite ſpent and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, I fell to the ground, and leaned my head on the lap of the woman that attended me. The poor creature was inconſolable to ſee me in that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. She ſpoke, but I neither anſwered nor hearkened to her. The night grew dark and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal. Overpowered by grief and wearineſs, I fell aſleep as I lay, for nature will take care of herſelf, and will loſe nothing of her dues.</p>
            <p>I opened my eyes juſt as the day began to break, and my misfortunes glaring afreſh with the light, I was filled with horror when I ſaw them diſtinctly. I recalled them all to my mind. I loſe an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed prince, ſaid I; I have not loved him, when his paſſion, meeting with a return of mine, might have made us happy, and I adore him now I am on the point of loſing him! Mercileſs love means to revenge him, and make me the object of its moſt cruel perſecutions.—And by what hand do I loſe him? By the hand of a perfidious man, who perhaps, has never loved me. I have been the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim of his vanity. My life, my reputation, all is to be enveloped in the odium of guilt. I ſhall be confounded with thoſe of my ſex, who have forſak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en glory and forfeited their honour. What a heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaking ſtory for a father, whoſe delight and darling I once was! But in what condition muſt the prince's mother be, ſhe who lived but for him? Muſt it be my fate to involve ſo many people in
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:047094_0057_1022AAAC1B3E9C00"/>
my misfortunes? Why do I fly? It would be too happy for me to be ſacrificed to their juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment.—And, indeed, in ſome moments, I was for going back to offer myſelf to their fury, but then again, ſhame getting the better of my deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate reſolution, I could think of nothing but hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing myſelf from their eyes, and ſeeking ſome for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn cave, where I might ſpend the remainder of my days.—"But after all, ſaid I again to myſelf, what is my crime, good God! thou knoweſt the bottom of all hearts. An involuntary paſſion hath entered my ſoul. I have rejected and oppoſed its gratifications. I never have tranſgreſſed my duty nor modeſty. What then am I puniſhed for?"</p>
            <p>The young woman that bore me company, was all this while melting into tears. "Alas, madam, ſaid ſhe, what reſolution are you taking? So fair and ſo young, what are you not going to expoſe yourſelf to?—Perhaps, replied I, I ſhall meet with, ſome friendly villain who will deprive me of a life, which the Deity orders me to retain as a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. No, anſwered ſhe, you can find no enemies amongſt men; but if you will be ruled by me, I have a ſiſter ſettled in a ſmall town not far off; I will conduct you to her; you will not be known, and will be leſs diſagreeable there, than thus wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about from place to place."</p>
            <p>I took her advice; we ſet out, and in a little time arrived at the place, whither ſhe deſigned to carry me. Her ſiſter received us very kindly;—I went for her friend, as it had been agreed between us; I found them buſy in marrying one of their children. But, on the wedding-day, as I did not chooſe to be ſeen by the company, I went out ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the morning, with my companion, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of taking an airing, and, walking by the edge of a little hill, I ſaw a wood. I took a fancy <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

go into it, and perceiving a hut, which my friend told me was an hermitage, I went up to it, and found it open. A ſhepherd, that was attending his flock near the place, informed us, that the hermit, who uſed to inhabit it, was thought to be lately dead in going his rounds about the country. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this information, I ſtepped in, and finding it convenient for my purpoſe, cried out immediately to my maid—"This is a dwelling kind fortune of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers me; here I am determined to ſpend the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of my ſorrowful days." I have according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put my project in execution, and, to this day, ladies, no body but you have been here to interrupt my ſolitude and grief.</p>
