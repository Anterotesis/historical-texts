            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>A REVISAL and correction of "E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſtus," literally tranſlated by a native of Germany, lately arrived in Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania, gave riſe to the following piece. The happy ſimplicity of the German original, written in one act by the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated Geſner, ſuggeſted an enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the plan. A new character is added, ſongs are introduced, and the dialogue ſo modelled, as to be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered (it is preſumed) pleaſing to an American ear.</p>

                     <p>MERCY on me! what is become of Simon? Some bad accident or other has happened to the poor, dear fellow. What ſhall we do, if he ſhould never return? No victuals in the houſe; no meſſenger to go for any, and little, very little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney remaining. I never ſuſpected, when I turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed cook, that things would come to this paſs. Our family at times might as well have a coach with a fifth wheel to it, as a cook. Now and then we get a comfortable meal; now and then, I ſay. But in general we lead the life of a dog—hunger and eaſe.—Falſe-hearted Simon! thou worſt of cannibals! thus to deſert maſter and miſtreſs, our promiſing young gentleman, and thy own Debby—The fellow is certainly taking his ſwing in ſome tavern or other, drinking, and gormandizing; or perhaps making love to ſome draggled-tail'd—But I'll match him; I'll match him.</p>

The birds ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver over my head, as if unapprehenſive of my gun, whilſt the deer, no longer timid, feed in ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſeem to defy my feeble efforts. Once more let me enter my cottage; the abode—O Heaven!—the abode of innocence and afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                     <p>Incomparable woman! how piouſly reſigned to, the will of Heaven! Alone, ſhe indulges in the extreme of ſorrow; but at my approach the ſmiles of conjugal affection add new luſtre to her charms. Joy ſeems to triumph on her countenance, leſt grief ſhould lour on mine. The wife is ſtudious to cheer the boſom of her deſponding huſband, whilſt the woman and the mother feels internally all the horrors of her ſituation. Such virtue is entitled to reward. But as for me, O! that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs were my lot only!—that I alone were doom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to miſery—provided that ſhe and my ſon were happy! Our poverty increaſes. Age, accelerated by grief and ſickneſs, advances with rapid ſtrides. My money is nearly exhauſted; and alas! I have no credit. Deſerted by my father, from whom can

I expect relief? The exertions of my induſtry have been deſtroyed by the late ſtorm. Twelve years have elapſed, ſince I entreated forgiveneſs from my father in a letter fraught with filial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition. Alas! can the fault, which I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, excuſe his ſeverity? Deteſting treachery towards a woman, who united herſelf to me in conſequence of my moſt ſolemn promiſes, I have diſcharged the duty of a man of honour, although in ſo doing I acted contrary to his commands. Not all the glare of riches, not all the pride of dominion, could have ſoothed the horrors of my mind, had I conſigned to obloquy and diſgrace a woman, who juſtly lays claim to univerſal eſteem. But let me not deſpond. Nature will aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert her rights, and the heart of my father muſt at length relent. My ſon approaches! Gracious Heaven! to what miſery may he not be expoſed! I will conceal my ſorrow, and aſſume the ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of contentment, whilſt anguiſh preys upon my heart. Hitherto ſecluded from the world, his converſation is neceſſarily puerile, but his heart, I truſt, is good, and his underſtanding not defective.</p>

I do not wiſh, they ſhould ſee me yet awhile—But why ſo, Simon!—A bad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is the reaſon; otherwiſe the ſight of your beſt friends would be as agreeable to you as ever.—What a buſtle in my boſom! My heart is in a terrible uproar. It ſtrikes againſt my ſide like a tennis-ball;—and my pulſe too—it gallops like a troop of horſe. My breaſt feels as if a mountain were on it. Simon! you are a cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard!—not I; I am no coward; a little afraid or

ſo.—If I am a knave, I am at leaſt a well-meaning, praiſe-worthy ſort of a knave. I have acted from the beſt of principles; a wiſh to relieve the diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Who calls me a robber?—I ſay, he is a good for nothing, lying ſon of a—I am an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, truſt-worthy, tender-hearted fellow. So, Mr. Conſcience! I beg of you to be quiet, and give me no further trouble. If I had committed this robbery—I ſay, if I had made free with the old gentleman's purſe from bad motives—why—it might have been called a robbery. But as I acted from pure, diſintereſted motives—it is no robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at all; not in the leaſt. Intention and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances quite alter the nature of things. I'll be hanged, if there is any crime at all in it. Yet— I do not know how it happens—I tremble in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry limb, as if I deſerved to be hanged indeed. I would not for the world old Deborah ſhould ſee me. She would ſwear the gallows was in my face.
<stage>(Taking a purſe out of his pocket.)</stage>
Here is the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no!—What charming muſic it makes in the old green purſe! This will put Debby in tune, and make her pot boil merrily for ſome weeks at leaſt. But it was obtained unjuſtly—and on the high-way too—if I had tricked a man out of it in the way of a bargain, there would have been no harm done— But to act ſo barefacedly!—Simon! you old knave! you will certainly pay for this one day or another. Good Mr. Conſcience! forgive me for this time—it is my firſt offence—and I will never do ſo any more. You pull an honeſt fellow's heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrings ſo ſeverely, that I vow and proteſt, it is better to die peaceably with hunger, than to live in luxury after having once offended you. It is very true, that, becauſe our worthy family are in a ſtarving condition, I did preſume to aſk a traveller—perhaps rather in a peremptory ſtyle—for
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:022638_0020_0FB9B6B0AF8DF728"/>
a trifle, of which he can be in no great want. He will ſoon have recourſe to his bureau, which will make him ample amends for the pityful ſum I bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from him. But after all is it not a burning ſhame, that the rich ſhould wallow in exceſs, whilſt my worthy maſter, his charming Amelia, the young gentleman, their ſon; and honeſt Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, not forgetting greaſy Deborah—are ready at times to periſh with hunger in theſe regions of miſery? I ſay, it is a ſcandalous thing; and who dares ſay to tne contrary?—O Lud! O Lud!— I hear ſomebody coming.—No—What a ſimple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton I am!—Simon! take heart; you have given proofs of courage; you muſt now diſplay your wiſdom. But, as I hate to be croſs-queſtioned, let me think on what I may ſafely ſay.—Honeſt Simon! ſtick to the truth.—You old fool! do you mean to tie the rope about your own neck?—A hard tax upon my veracity!—I'll tell him—what? That will never do—worſe, and worſe, you block-head!—I am at my wits ends. I'll tell him—yes— this will do; now I have it. I'll tell him, that a great man, whom I do not know, met me—I have forgot where—and aſked me, if I was yet in Mr. George Wilſon's ſervice; told me, that he had heard lately of his diſtreſſed circumſtances; piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him much—and a great deal more to the ſame purpoſe—and ſo—this good, worthy gentleman— Who is coming?—Only Mr. William—I am ſo ſtinted in time, that I fear I ſhall make but a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry piece of work of it. Whilſt I am thinking of a plauſible ſtory, I will trifle away a minute or two with this over-grown boy, who knows no more of the world, than if he did not belong to it.—Honeſt Simon, I fear after all, you will turn out but a pitiful liar, and a paltry politician.</p>
