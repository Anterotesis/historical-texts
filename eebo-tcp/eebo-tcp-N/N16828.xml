            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PARTICULAR ELECTION AND FINAL PERSEVERANCE <hi>VINDICATED.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>CONTROVERSY is generally complained of, and peace is earneſtly ſought; but often in a way, which denies to all others the liberty we claim for ourſelves. The revealed will of God is the only perfect law of liberty; but how little is it believed and obeyed by mankind. Both the Hebrew and Chriſtian churches, were to be wholly governed by it; and when the firſt King of Iſrael preſumed to violate a plain command of God, and then thought to atone for it by acts of worſhip, he was guilty of <hi>rebellion,</hi> which is as the ſin of <hi>witchcraft.</hi> 1 Sam. xv. 23. And in like way Myſtery Babylon, by her <hi>ſorceries, has deceived all nations,</hi> and in her was found the <hi>blood of prophets,</hi> and <hi>of ſaints, and of all that were ſlain upon the earth.</hi> Rev. xviii. 23, 24. Yet theſe extenſive terms are ſo limited by carnal reaſoners, that none of them, in any nation, will allow themſelves to be of that bloody city. And at the ſame time they are for extending general words of grace, beyond any li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits; and are ready to accuſe us with making God deceitful, if we hold that he did not deſign the merits of his Son, equally for all mankind. If we enquire then, why all are not ſaved? the general
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:021663_0004_0FB500C6EF9B5120"/>anſwer is, that they would not receive that ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or if they did for a while, and then turned away from it, God rejects and deſtroys them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for. We readily grant that God always rewards the righteous, and never deſtroys any for any thing but ſin and iniquity; but this cannot content many, without we will allow that grace hath put power into the wills of all mankind, to become righteous, and to obtain ſalvation, when they ſhall pleaſe to ſet about it in earneſt. The fruit of which is, that men <hi>neglect the great ſalvation, becauſe they love dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs rather than light. Yea, every one that doeth evil, hateth the light.</hi> Heb. ii. 3. John iii. 19, 20. And when any are brought to obey the truth, and ſo come to the light, every art is made uſe of, to get them into darkneſs again, if poſſible.</p>
            <p>This has been remarkably the caſe in the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern parts of America. Many of their teachers were ſo dark as to ſwear profanely, drink to exceſs, and follow gaming; and at the ſame time to preach up <hi>do and live</hi> to their people. But the light of the pure goſpel, produced ſome reformation among them above forty years ago; and it has greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed ſince 1768, as I was well informed, when I was called to travel and preach in Virginia and North-Carolina, laſt winter. But after this refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation had ſpread extenſively, the followers of Mr. John Weſley introduced his writings againſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular election and final perſeverance, and thereby greatly obſtructed the work. I was therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted to publiſh a brief anſwer thereto. His firſt piece on that ſubject, was publiſhed above fifty years ago, under the title of <hi>Free grace,</hi> and it was cloſed with a hymn called, <hi>Univerſal redemption,</hi> and therein he ſays,</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:021663_0005_0FB500C7C1E0ED30"/>
               <l>Thine eye ſurvey'd the fallen race,</l>
               <l>When ſunk in ſin they lay,</l>
               <l>Their miſery call'd for all thy grace,</l>
               <l>But Juſtice ſtop'd the way.</l>
               <l>Mercy the fatal bar remov'd,</l>
               <l>Thy only Son it gave,</l>
               <l>To ſave a world ſo dearly lov'd,</l>
               <l>A ſinful world to ſave.</l>
               <l>For every man he taſted death,</l>
               <l>He ſuffered once for all,</l>
               <l>He calls as many ſouls as breathe,</l>
               <l>And all <hi>may</hi> hear the call.</l>
               <l>A power to chuſe, a will t'obey,</l>
               <l>Freely his grace <hi>reſtores;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>We all may find the living way,</l>
               <l>And call the Saviour ours.</l>
            </q>
            <p>He denied that man had any <hi>natural</hi> liberty of will left, after the fall, until it was <hi>reſtored</hi> by grace. This he more explicitly did in a pamphlet on pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination, election and reprobation, publiſhed in 1776; and ſaid upon it, "We believe, that in the moment Adam fell, he had no freedom of will left; but that God, when of his own free grace he gave the promiſe of a Saviour to him and his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, graciouſly reſtored to mankind a liberty and power to accept of proffered ſalvation." P. 16. But if the fall took all <hi>natural</hi> liberty of choice from man, until grace reſtored it, then the fall releaſed him from the authority of the law of God, as it was firſt given to him, and he never hath been under it ſince, but under grace. The beaſts are not under that law, becauſe they never had the powers of thinking and choice, as rational creatures have; and if men are not under that law, what are they better then beaſts? Yea, do they not <hi>corrupt</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:021663_0006_0FB500D0055D0FE8"/>more than brute beaſts, that know and obey their owners? Jude, 10. Iſaiah i. 2—4. And if all freedom of will is from grace, then it is only by grace that any have power to ſin againſt God, as none can ſin againſt him who have no natural li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of will. This opinion is moſt plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by the caſe of the fallen angels, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had any grace revealed to them; yet the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſinneth from the beginning,</hi> and all wilful ſinners are <hi>children of the devil,</hi> in oppoſition to all thoſe who are <hi>born of God.</hi> John iii. 8—10. In the ſame book Mr. Weſley ſays,
<list>
                  <item>"1. God's love was the cauſe of his ſending his Son to die for ſinners.</item>
                  <item>2. Chriſt's dying for ſinners is the cauſe of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel's being preached.</item>
                  <item>3. The preaching of the goſpel is the cauſe (or means) of our believing.</item>
                  <item>4. Our believing is the cauſe or condition of our juſtification.</item>
                  <item>5. The knowing ourſelves juſtified through his blood, is the cauſe of our love to Chriſt.</item>
                  <item>6. Our love to Chriſt is the cauſe of our obedience to him.</item>
                  <item>7. Our obedience to Chriſt is the cauſe of his becoming the author of eternal ſalvation to us."</item>
               </list>
P. 8.</p>
            <p>And is not this a going about to eſtabliſh our own righteouſneſs? For Moſes deſcribeth the righteouſneſs which is of the law, <hi>That the man who doth thoſe things, ſhall live by them.</hi> This is a <hi>zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.</hi> Rom. x. 2—5. Mr. Weſley goes on to ſay, "I ſhall now briefly ſhew the dreadful abſurdities that follow from ſaying <hi>Chriſt died only for the elect.</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>If Chriſt died not for all, then unbelief is no ſin in them that finally periſh; ſeeing there is not any thing for thoſe men to believe unto ſalvation for whom Chriſt died not.</item>
                  <item>2. If Chriſt died not for all men,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:021663_0007_0FB500D960AD3818"/>then it would be a ſin in the greateſt part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to believe he died <hi>for them;</hi> ſeeing it would be to believe a lie.</item>
                  <item>3. If Chriſt died not for thoſe that are damned, then they are not damned for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief; otherwiſe you ſay, that they are damned for not believing a lie.</item>
                  <item>4. If Chriſt died not for all, then thoſe who obey Chriſt, by going and preaching the goſpel to every creature, as glad tidings of grace and peace, of great joy <hi>to all people,</hi> do ſin thereby, in that they go <hi>to moſt people</hi> with a lie in their mouth.</item>
                  <item>5. If Chriſt died not for all men, then God is not in earneſt in <hi>calling all men every where to repent;</hi> for what good could repentance do thoſe, for whom Chriſt died not?</item>
                  <item>6. If Chriſt died not for all, then why does he ſay, <hi>He is not willing that any ſhould periſh?</hi> Surely he is willing, yea reſolved that moſt men ſhould periſh; elſe he would have died for them alſo.</item>
                  <item>7. How ſhall God judge the world by the man Chriſt Jeſus, if Chriſt did not die for the world? or how ſhall he judge them according to the goſpel, when there was never any goſpel or mercy for them?"</item>
               </list>
P. 14.</p>
            <p>Anſwer, If Chriſt died with a deſign to ſave all men, why are not all ſaved? Can the devil cheat him of a great part of his purchaſe? Or can men defeat his merciful deſigns? No, ſay many, he died for all, and he will finally ſave all. Others go farther, and conclude that a God of infinite goodneſs could not give exiſtence to any creature that ſhall be miſerable without end; but that he will finally deliver every child of Adam from hell, though many of them will be tormented therein for <hi>ages of ages.</hi> But how is their deceit here diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered? Fallen angels were as really the creatures of God, as fallen men; yet no ſalvation was ever
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:021663_0008_0FB500E1E711E848"/>revealed for them, but they are reſerved in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting chains under darkneſs, unto the judgement of the great day. And this is a clear evidence againſt ungodly men, who turn grace into laſcivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. Jude 4, 6. God was ſo far from ever proclaiming atonement to all men, without any exception, that he ſaid, <hi>The ſoul that doth ought preſumptuouſly, the ſame reproacheth the Lord; and that ſoul ſhall be cut off from among his people.</hi> And for ſuch preſumption, Korah and his company pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed moſt terribly. Num. xv. 30. xvi. 1—3, 31—34. And teachers who privily brought dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable hereſies into the Chriſtian church, were <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous</hi> and <hi>ſelf-willed,</hi> under the name of <hi>liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> They <hi>deſpiſed government,</hi> and <hi>periſhed in the gainſaying of Core.</hi> 2 Peter, ii. 1, 10, 19. Jude 11. For if the inability of debtors and criminals, could releaſe them from the authority of the laws, until rulers would give them power to bring the government to their own terms, how would all <hi>dominion be deſpiſed!</hi> Theſe <hi>filthy dreamers</hi> have now filled the world with Babylonian confuſion. Jude 8. The Jews called it <hi>hereſy</hi> in Paul, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in and obey Jeſus, as a lawgiver above Moſes. Acts xxiv. 14. And this is the firſt place where the word hereſy is uſed in the Bible; and if we obſerve what is ſaid in the laſt chapter in it, of ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery man who ſhall add to, or take from its words, muſt we not conclude that all men who do ſo, and violently impoſe their inventions upon others, are guilty of hereſy? The head of the church of Rome aſſumed God's place in the church, and exalted himſelf above God, who never could violate his <hi>promiſe</hi> or his <hi>oath,</hi> or <hi>entice</hi> any into ſin; and how juſtly are all thoſe given up to ſtrong deluſion, who
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:021663_0009_0FB500E2F4F937E0"/>practiſe either of theſe evils? 2 Theſſ. ii. 3—12. Heb. vi. 18. James i. 13—15. And how happy ſhould we ſoon be, if theſe iniquities were exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from our land?</p>
            <p>True believers are ſo far from preſuming upon the ſecret deſigns of God, that when the ſame are revealed, they dare not make his deſigns, but his laws, the rule of their conduct. Though his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of removing Saul, and making David King over Iſrael, was clearly revealed, yet David refuſed to kill Saul, when greatly provoked thereto, becauſe he had no direction to do it. Neither did David aſſume the regal power over Iſrael, until each tribe freely received him as their King by a ſolemn covenant. But the envious Jews, no ſooner had it declared to them, that Jeſus was to die for that nation, than from that day forth, they took counſel together for to put him to death. John xi. 53. Hereby we may ſee the plain difference between true believers and reprobates. For unto the pure all things are pure; but unto the defiled and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing, is nothing pure; but even their mind and conſcience is defiled. They profeſs that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and diſobedient, and unto every good work <hi>reprobate.</hi> Titus i. 15, 16. In this way, teachers who turn grace into laſciviouſneſs, deny the only Lord God, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Jude 4. But many are deceived by them, becauſe in words they profeſs to know him. Since Chriſt was exalted to the right hand of the Father, his only prieſts upon earth, are <hi>elect</hi> according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Spirit unto obedience, and ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the blood of Jeſus Chriſt.—Being born
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:021663_0010_0FB500E44C64E9A0"/>again, not of corruptible ſeed, but incorruptible, by the word of God which liveth and abideth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. Theſe are a <hi>choſen</hi> generation, a royal prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, an holy nation, a peculiar people, that they ſhould ſhew forth the praiſes of him who hath call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them out of darkneſs into his marvellous light. 1 Peter, i. 2, 23. ii. 5, 9. But Mr. Weſley, in his piece on predeſtination, election, and reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſays, "They were choſen through belief of the truth, and called to believe it by the goſpel; therefore they were not choſen before they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, much leſs before they had a being." P. 5. And in his ſermon from Rom. viii. 29, 30, he ſays, "Good looking on all ages from the creation to the conſummation as a moment, and ſeeing at once whatever is in the hearts of all the children of men, knows every one that does or does not believe in every age or nation. Yet what he knows, whether faith or unbelief, is in no wife cauſed by his knowledge. Men are as <hi>free</hi> in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving or not believing, as if he did not know it at all." P. 6.</p>
            <p>I readily grant that his knowledge does not cauſe any ſin, which is altogether of the creature. The angels who fell, <hi>kept not their firſt eſtate, but left their own habitation.</hi> Jude 6. And thoſe who ſtood were <hi>elect angels.</hi> 1 Tim. v. 21. And ſin came into human nature by violating a known command; and Adam was a <hi>figure</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, and therefore death reigned over all his poſterity, many of whom never committed any actual tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, as he did. And the word <hi>as,</hi> ſo often uſed in this affair, cannot be true in any ſenſe, if both Adam and Chriſt were not heads and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of all the ſeed of each. It is certain that
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:021663_0011_0FB500E5C724EB20"/>Adam was not a figure of Chriſt, as he conveyed death and ruin to his poſterity by a <hi>juſt ſentence of law;</hi> for Chriſt conveys life and ſalvation to ſouls by a free <hi>gift of grace.</hi> Neither could Adam be a figure of Chriſt, in the great things that he did by <hi>one offence;</hi> for Chriſt atoned for <hi>many offences;</hi> therefore <hi>where ſin abounded, grace did much more abound.</hi> Rom. v. 12.—21. Even to the <hi>reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the dead.</hi> 1 Cor. xv. 21, 22. I ſay the word <hi>as</hi> cannot be true in theſe places, unleſs thoſe two men acted for all their ſeed. Many would have it, that this word cannot be true unleſs Chriſt atoned for as many as fell in Adam; but certain death came upon all Adam's race, while multitudes hold that ſalvation by Chriſt is <hi>uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> and depends upon the wills of individuals. In this view they would make Chriſt vaſtly infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to Adam, whoſe doings were efficacious, and the doings of Chriſt exceeding precarious, upon their plan. And they who hold that Chriſt will finally ſave all the race of Adam from hell, yet imagine that the creature's ſufferings muſt ſave them, and not the efficacy of the death and grace of Chriſt. Or if they hold that he will ſave all from future ſufferings, they hold alſo that he hath now ſaved them from the authority of the law of God, which Adam never did. By the ſentence of it, every child of Adam returns to the duſt, the righteous as well as the wicked; ſo that if the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Chriſt are not efficacious for the final ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his ſeed, it cannot truly be ſaid that <hi>as</hi> in Adam all die, <hi>even ſo</hi> in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive. Adam was <hi>made upright;</hi> but Solomon could not tell how many <hi>inventions</hi> his children would ſeek out. Eccle. vii. 29. A darling one
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:021663_0012_0FB500F35BF8B4A0"/>in our day is, that a man cannot be worthy of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or puniſhment, unleſs he hath power in his will to become righteous when he pleaſeth. And if ſo, then faith would be of himſelf, and not the <hi>gift of God,</hi> directly againſt the truth of his word. Eph. ii. 8. Boaſting could not be excluded in ſuch a caſe, as it is by the <hi>law of faith.</hi> Rom. iii. 27. So that this controverſy is not with poor worms, but with the eternal God. His <hi>will</hi> was as really exerciſed in raiſing up Pharaoh and others, and ſuffering them to go far in their rebellion, and in oppreſſing the ſaints; as it was in finally deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the former and ſaving the latter. But the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt this doctrine, was and is, <hi>Why doth he yet find fault? for who hath ever reſiſted his will?</hi> This was the language of thoſe who followed after the law of righteouſneſs, but did not attain to it, becauſe they ſought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. Rom. ix. 16—32. Yea, and thoſe who do ſo are exceeding <hi>partial</hi> in the law.</p>
            <p>Mr. Weſley, in his book called, <hi>Predeſtination calmly conſidered,</hi> ſays, "I believe election to be conditional, as well as the reprobation oppoſite thereto. I believe the eternal decree concerning both, is expreſſed in thoſe words, <hi>He that believeth ſhall be ſaved: he that believeth not, ſhall be damned.</hi> And this decree without doubt God will not change, and man cannot reſiſt." P. 10. But where did he make any ſuch decree? In the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel commiſſion, he ſays, <hi>He that believeth and is baptiſed ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Mark xvi. 16. But men have preſumed to alter that decree, ever ſince the third century; before which no man hath proved that infant baptiſm was ever named in the world.
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:021663_0013_0FB500F4C4E017B8"/>By baptiſm believers <hi>put on Chriſt.</hi> Gal. iii. 27. Which no one can do for another, any more than one can be ſaved or damned for another in eternity. Chriſt is the only lawgiver to his church, and when Kings ſhall become nurſing fathers to her, they will <hi>bow down</hi> to his authority therein. Iſaiah xlix. 23. And how great is the difference betwixt a nurſe and a whoremaſter. The good tidings to Zion is, <hi>Thy God reigneth.</hi> And <hi>with the heart man believeth unto righteouſneſs, and with the mouth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion is made unto ſalvation.</hi> Iſaiah III. 7. Rom. x. 10, 15. And none will be owned by him in the laſt day, who are now aſhamed to confeſs him before men. Mat. x. 32, 33. And if God look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on all ages as a moment, how could he elect per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and then reject them again in that moment? Yet Weſley ſays, "One who is a true believer, or, in other words, one who is holy or righteous in the judgment of God himſelf, may nevertheleſs finally fall from grace." P. 49.</p>
            <p>His firſt argument to prove this aſſertion is taken from God's ſaying, When the righteous turneth away from his righteouſneſs, and committeth ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, in his treſpaſs that he hath treſpaſſed, and in his ſin that he hath ſinned, in them ſhall he die. Ezek. xviii. 24. From whence Weſley ſays, "One who is righteous in the judgment of God himſelf, may finally fall from grace." P. 51. Anſwer, God never promiſed to ſupport any one in an unrighteous way; neither will he deſtroy any true penitent, for his own ſins, or for the iniquity of his fathers; and if God cannot ſpeak of theſe things in a conditional way, without having the final event uncertain in his own infinite mind un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the creature decides it, then this argument may
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:021663_0014_0FB500F64DE962D8"/>ſtand, and not elſe. And if the creature could diſappoint the Creator, then we ſhould fear man more than God. A horrible evil! A ſecond ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is drawn from 1 Tim. i. 18, 19, from whence it is ſaid, "Obſerve,
<list>
                  <item>1. Theſe men had once the faith that produceth a <hi>good conſcience,</hi> which they had, or they could not have <hi>put it away.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. They <hi>made ſhipwreck</hi> of the faith, which neceſſarily implies the total and final loſs of it."</item>
               </list>
P. 51. But in the ſame chapter it is ſaid, The end of the commandment is charity, out of a pure heart, and of a good conſcience, and of faith unfeigned; from which ſome having ſwerved, have turned aſide unto vain jangling; deſiring to be teachers of the law, underſtanding neither what they ſay, nor whereof they affirm. And if men cannot be greatly enlightened and reformed by the Spirit of truth, and yet afterwards ſwerve from it and put it away, without ever being born again, then this argument may ſtand, and not otherwiſe. His third argument is framed from Rom. xi. 17, &amp;c. Upon which he ſays, "Thoſe who are grafted into the ſpiritual, inviſible church, may nevertheleſs finally fail." P. 53. To which I reply, That the unbelieving Jews failed from the viſible church, and ſaving faith was neceſſary to graft the Gentiles into it, who ought not to be high-minded, but fear, as is very evident from this paſſage; and God ſays, I will put my fear in their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me. Jer. xxxii 40. And who will dare to contradict him! Mr. Weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley takes his fourth argument from John xv. 1—6, from whence he infers, "That true believers, who are branches of the true vine, may nevertheleſs fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally fall." P. 55. But as Chriſt is the only head
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:021663_0015_0FB500F7B67CDE28"/>of the true church, many may be viſible branches in him, and yet be caſt into the fire for their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfulneſs, while living branches are purged and made more fruitful. And to ſuch Chriſt ſaid in the ſame chapter, Ye have not <hi>choſen</hi> me, but I have <hi>choſen</hi> you, and ordained you, that you ſhould go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit ſhould remain. Afterwards he ſaid to the Father, <hi>Of them which thou gaveſt me have I loſt none.</hi> John xviii. 9. Yet, fifthly, Mr. Weſley brings 2 Peter ii. 20, 21, to prove that "Thoſe who by the inward know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt, have eſcaped the pollutions of the world, may yet fall back into thoſe pollutions and periſh everlaſtingly." P. 56. But all ought to know, that the dog who returns to his vomit again, and the ſow that was waſhed to her wallowing in the mire, never had their natures changed, though their behaviour was ſo for a while. Therefore we are warned againſt giving the holy things of the church to dogs, ſwine or wolves, as far as we can diſcover them by their fruits. Mat. vii. 6, 15. His ſixth argument is taken from Heb. vi. 4—8. p. 56. But we may ſee that the perſons here ſpoken of, are like ground which beareth <hi>thorns and briars,</hi> and are entirely diſtinct from ſouls who receive the ſeed into <hi>good</hi> ground. Mat. xiii. 23. Our author takes his ſeventh argument from Heb. x. 38, which he ſays, if rightly tranſlated, is, "If the juſt man that lives by faith draws back, my ſoul ſhall have no pleaſure in him." P. 58. But we ought to know, that living by faith, and drawing back, are too oppoſite things; and the firſt is here urged as an effectual guard againſt the laſt. Eighth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, our opponant brings Heb. x. 26—29, to prove "That thoſe who are ſanctified by the blood of
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:021663_0016_0FB500FE75D1D8E8"/>the covenant, may yet periſh everlaſtingly." P. 62. But though perſons who ſin <hi>wilfully</hi> againſt the laws, blood and Spirit of Chriſt, will have a much ſorer puniſhment than they who died without mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy under the law of Moſes, yet this cannot prove that any ſuch perſon was ever truly regenerated. However, after quoting many more ſcripture warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings againſt diſobedience and apoſtacy, Mr. Weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley lets us know, that he would not have us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this doctrine by itſelf, "but as it ſtands in connection with unconditional reprobation, that mill-ſtone which hangs about the neck of your whole hypotheſis." P. 65.</p>
            <p>From whence we may ſee, that the plain lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of revelation is of no avail with him againſt his horrid ideas of reprobation. When any try to put that terrible word out of their minds, he ſays, "To think about a <hi>certain number</hi> of ſouls, whom <hi>alone</hi> God hath decreed to ſave, in that very thought reprobation lurks: it entered your heart the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that entered: it ſtays as long as that ſtays; and you cannot ſpeak that thought, without ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reprobation. True, it is covered with fig-leaves, ſo that a heedleſs eye may not obſerve it to be there. But if you narrowly obſerve, uncondi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional election cannot appear, without the cloven foot of reprobation." P. 9. Anſwer, We well know that the doctrine of particular election, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, that the reſt of mankind are left to periſh in their ſins, as God might juſtly have dealt with us all. But this idea is rejected by Mr. Weſley. And when it was ſaid, "You know in your own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, God might juſtly have paſt by you," he ſaid, "I deny it. That God might <hi>juſtly,</hi> for my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs to his grace, have <hi>given me up</hi> long <hi>ago,</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:021663_0017_0FB500FF9F4CAA30"/>I grant: but this conceſſion ſuppoſes me to have had that grace, which you ſay a reprobate never had." P. 18. Anſwer, We are far from believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that all the <hi>natural</hi> liberty of men is by grace, as he hath aſſerted; for God ſays, In the laſt days perilous times ſhall come; for men ſhall be lovers of their ownſelves, covetous, boaſters, proud, blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers, diſobedient to parents, unthankful, unho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without natural affection, truce-breakers, falſe accuſers, incontinent, fierce deſpiſers of thoſe that are good, traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleaſures more than lovers of God; having a form of godlineſs, but denying the power thereof: from ſuch turn away.—Theſe reſiſt the truth; <hi>reprobate</hi> concerning the faith. 2 Tim. iii. 1—8. This is a moſt exact deſcription of the reprobates of our day. But I am far from thinking that grace gave them a power to love themſelves above God and their neighbours, and to run into all this wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs under a form of godlineſs, while they deny the power thereof. Yea, do not all thoſe deny the power of it, who deny particular election and final perſeverance? Mr. Weſley ſays, "I have heard, that God the Father made a covenant with his Son, before the world began, wherein the Son agreed to ſuffer ſuch and ſuch things, and the Father to give him ſuch and ſuch ſouls for a recompenſe: that in conſequence of this, thoſe ſouls <hi>muſt</hi> be ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and thoſe only, ſo that all others <hi>muſt</hi> be damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed." This idea of the covenant he rejects, and ſays, "The tenor of it is this; Whoſoever believeth unto the end, ſo as to ſhew his faith by his works, I the Lord will reward that ſoul eternally: but whoſoever will not believe, and conſequently dieth in his ſins, I will puniſh him with everlaſting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction."
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:021663_0018_0FB50102627D3D28"/>P. 44, 45. And what difference is there between this and ſaying, <hi>The man that doth them ſhall live in them?</hi> They who turn the goſpel into this ſenſe, are <hi>bewitched.</hi> Gal. iii. 1, 12. As to the covenant, Jeſus ſaid, <hi>I lay down my life for the ſheep.—Ye believe not, becauſe ye are not of my ſheep, as I ſaid unto you. My ſheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me; and I give unto them eternal life, and they ſhall never periſh, neither ſhall any pluck them out of my hand. My Father who gave them me, is greater than all, and none is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand. Jeſus lift up his eyes to heaven, and ſaid, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son alſo may glorify thee. As thou haſt given him power over all fleſh, that he ſhould give eternal life to as many as thou haſt given him.</hi> John x. 15, 26—29. xvii. 1, 2. If particular election, and final perſeverance, are not contained in theſe paſſages, I know not what can be intended therein. And as Mr. Weſley and his followers are ſo vehement againſt that doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and tell of ſhewing their faith by their works, it is needful to examine ſome of their works con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning America.</p>
            <p>In November 1763, Mr. Weſley ſaid in his <hi>Journal,</hi> "Many have been convinced of ſin, many juſtified, and many backſliders healed. But the peculiar work of this ſeaſon has been, what St. Paul calls <hi>The perfecting of the ſaints.</hi> Many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in London, in Briſtol, in York, and in vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous parts both of England and Ireland, have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced ſo deep and univerſal a change, as it had not before entered into their hearts to receive. After a deep conviction of inbred ſin, of their total fall from God, they have been ſo filled with faith
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:021663_0019_0FB50103C9F1B338"/>and love (and generally in a moment) that ſin va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and they found from that time no pride, anger, deſire or unbelief. They could rejoice ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, pray without ceaſing, and in every thing give thanks. Now whether we call this the <hi>deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> or <hi>ſuſpenſion</hi> of ſin, it is a glorious work of God: ſuch work, as conſidering both the depth and extent of it, we never ſaw in theſe kingdoms before. It is poſſible, ſome who ſpoke in this manner, were miſtaken, and it is certain, ſome have loſt what they then received." That many of them were miſtaken, can eaſily be believed; much eaſier than to believe that any of them were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and then fell from it. For as long as their controverſy in Britain, about taxing America, was carried on by words, Mr. Weſley openly appeared in our favour; but when they came to blows, he ſhifted ſides, and exerted all his extenſive influence in that <hi>bloody cauſe;</hi> and ſo did Mr. John Fletcher, an author much eſteemed by that ſect. Mr. Weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley was in the city of Briſtol in September 1774, and highly recommended to his friends a pamphlet wrote by M. P. entitled, <hi>An argument in defence of the excluſive right claimed by the colonies to tax them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi> But when the ſword was drawn the next year, Mr. Weſley took out the ſubſtance of a piece wrote by Dr. J. entitled, <hi>Taxation no tyranny,</hi> and added ſome warm reflections of his own, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed the whole as his own, to inflame all his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers againſt us. Therefore a Baptiſt miniſter in Briſtol, publiſhed a brief anſwer to him, with a men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe facts, under the name of Americanus. Hereupon Weſley reprinted his pamphlet, with a preface, in which he ſaid, "The book which this writer ſays I ſo ſtrongly recommended, <hi>I never yet
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:021663_0020_0FB50106D94B43F8"/>ſaw with my eyes.</hi> The words which he ſays I ſpoke, <hi>never came out of my lips."</hi> Two of his friends in Briſtol, each wrote to him, that they knew he herein wronged the truth, yet he refuſed to make any public retraction, until Mr. Caleb Evans, the ſaid Baptiſt miniſter, publiſhed a letter to him in a newſpaper; and then he ſaid,</p>

            <p>But did he let go perſonal reflections? Mr. Evans's reply is before me, wherein he ſays, "Your inſinuating that I have taken more from Mr. P. that you have from Dr. J. is an artifice to cover
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:021663_0021_0FB5010849BA8E08"/>your own plagiariſm, too thin not to be ſeen through by the moſt ſuperficial. It is not <hi>fact.</hi> I have not taken a line from that or any other author without acknowledging it. But when you pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed your addreſs, you gave not even a hint of having taken any part of it from Dr. J. or any other writer." Thus did Mr. Weſley exert all his influence, to aſſiſt Great-Britain in her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to bind us in all caſes whatever. And had they ſucceeded therein, we ſhould have been in as bad a caſe, as he ſays Adam was before a Saviour was revealed to him. Yea, as much worſe as fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the hands of unmerciful men, is worſe than being in the hands of a merciful God. And theſe men are ſtill purſuing us, with attempts to rob us of our only hope in Chriſt, and alſo of the liberty wherewith he hath made us free. For in 1784, M. Weſley and his followers publiſhed a book in England, which they call, <hi>The Sunday ſervice in North-America.</hi> Three orders of miniſters are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed therein, who are to have the whole power of receiving and excluding church members, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out calling any vote of the brethren; and when the loweſt order of thoſe miniſters is to be ordained, they ſay to him, "Will you reverently obey them to whom the charge and government over you is committed, following with a glad mind and will their godly admonitions? Anſwer, I will endeavour ſo to do, the Lord being my helper." P. 283. Soon after which they publiſhed a pamphlet, entitled, "A form of diſcipline, for the miniſters, preachers, and members of the Methodiſt epiſcopal church in America; conſidered and approved at a conference held at Baltimore, in the State of Maryland, on Monday the 27th of December, 1784; in which
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:021663_0022_0FB50110433ED750"/>the reverend Thomas Coke, L. L. D. and the reverend Francis Aſbury, preſided." In their firſt ſection they ſay,
<list>
                  <item>Queſt. 1. What was the riſe of Methodiſm, ſo called, in Europe? Anſw. In 1729, two young men, reading the Bible, ſaw they could not be ſaved without holineſs, followed after it, and invited others ſo to do. In 1737, they ſaw likewiſe, that men are juſtified before they are ſanctified; but ſtill holineſs was their object. God then thruſt them out, to raiſe an holy people.</item>
                  <item>Queſt. 2. What was the riſe of Methodiſm, ſo called, in America? Anſw. During the ſpace of thirty years paſt, certain perſons, members of the ſociety, emigrated from England and Ireland, and ſettled in various parts of this country. About twenty years ago, Philip Embary, a local preacher from Ireland, began to preach in the city of New-York, and formed a ſociety of his own countrymen and the citizens. About the ſame time, Robert Strawbridge, a local preacher from Ireland, ſettled in Frederick county, in the ſtate of Maryland, and preaching there, formed ſome ſocieties. In 1769, Richard Boardman and Joſeph Pilman, came to New-York, who were the firſt regular Methodiſt preachers on the continent. In the latter end of the year 1771, Francis Aſbury and Richard Wright, of the ſame order, came over.</item>
                  <item>Queſt. 3. What may we reaſonably believe to be God's deſign, in raiſing up the preachers called Methodiſts? Anſw. To reform the continent, and ſpread ſcripture ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs over theſe lands. As a proof hereof, we have ſeen in the courſe of fifteen years a great and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious work of God, from New-York through the Jerſies, Pennſylvania, Maryland, Virginia, North and South Carolina, even to Georgia."</item>
               </list>
And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:021663_0023_0FB501160713EB90"/>they admit any man to preach in their ſociety, they ſay to him, "Have you faith in Chriſt? are you going on to perfection? do you expect to be made perfect in love in this life?" After which they ſay, "We are all agreed, we may be ſaved from all ſin before death." P. 13, 30. Thus a ſociety, many of whoſe laws are contrary to the laws of Chriſt, and whoſe head is in Great-Britain, are ſpreading their influence in America, and have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready tried to get ſome of their leaders elected in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſtate Legiſlature in Virginia, if not in other States.</p>
            <p>The law of Chriſt puts all <hi>Elders</hi> in the church upon a level, and ſays to the whole community, <hi>All of you be ſubject one to another, and be clothed with humility, for God reſiſteth the proud, and giveth grace unto the humble.</hi> 1 Peter v. 1—5. And when Chriſt came a light into the world, the only perſons that believed on him, <hi>were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God. Except a man be born again he cannot ſee the kingdom of God.</hi> John i. 12, 13. iii. 3. But ever ſince the riſe of the man of ſin, teachers have claimed a power of office above the church, which none could convey to others but officers; and alſo a power in their wills to bring children into the kingdom of God, without their own knowledge or choice. And to this day men are exceeding tenacious of this arbitrary power. The followers of Mr. Weſley ſay, in their form of diſcipline, "Queſt. 1. How is a biſhop conſtituted? Anſwer, By the election of the majority of the conference, and the laying on of hands of a biſhop, and the elders preſent.—Queſtion 5. If by death, expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or otherwiſe there be no biſhop remaining in
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:021663_0024_0FB50118C5C9C020"/>our church, what method ſhall be purſued? An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, Let the conference immediately elect a biſhop, and let the elders, or any three of them, conſecrate him to his office." The Preſbyterians hold biſhops and elders to be equal, but both above the church, and in this way many hold their ſucceſſion of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice from the old biſhops in England. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident of their univerſity in Connecticut, in a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon before the Legiſlature of that State, ſaid of the firſt miniſters in New-England, "The induc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the miniſters of the firſt churches, was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by lay-brethren, and this was called ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but ſhould be conſidered what in reality it was, only induction or inſtalment of thoſe who were veſted with official power. Theſe were all ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before by the biſhops in England."<note n="*" place="bottom">Stiles's election ſermon, May 8, 1783, p. 61.</note> Another of their noted miniſters ſaid to the Baptiſts the ſame year, "To be conſiſtent with yourſelves, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not look on any of us as Chriſtians, or any church in the world but your own denomination, to be a church of Chriſt; all the world but yourſelves, are in a ſtate of paganiſm; not one baptized per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in it except yourſelves: not one miniſter of the goſpel, but your own; and when you rebap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize thoſe in adult years, which we have baptized in their infancy, you and they jointly renounce that Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, whom we adore and worſhip, as the only living and true God, and on whom we depend for all our ſalvation."<note n="†" place="bottom">Huntington's addreſs, p. 23.</note> And a Preſbyterian miniſter in North-Carolina, though more charitable, yet ſays of the Baptiſts, "They made their appearance in Germany ſoon after the reformation began; but the preſent race of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:021663_0025_0FB5011A37DE1BD8"/>are happily very unlike the furious and blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirſty bigots who wore the name at that time.— Conſidering that they have no written ſtandard of orthodoxy, and that their preachers are men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a liberal education, I have often ſat with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and pleaſure to hear them ſo ſound in doctrine as they really are."<note n="*" place="bottom">Pattillo's ſermons, 1788, P. 47, 48.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed it may juſtly be matter of thankful won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to all, conſidering the errors of learned mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters on every hand. For if our civil rulers ſhould now declare, that they derived their office power from Great-Britain, and that the people of America had only inducted them into their offices to which they had a prior right, what a confuſion ſhould we ſoon be in! But this is not the worſt of our caſe; for all who have renounced the only living and true God, are pagans, and the covenant of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, on which infant baptiſm is built, required Iſrael to deſtroy all the pagans in Canaan, and to ſeize upon their eſtates. And from the bloody imagination, that Chriſtians had a right to do the like, came the late war. The church of Rome acted upon this bloody imagination, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til England revolted from her in 1533, and ſet up their king as the head of their church. The inhabitants of Munſter in Germany did the like the ſame year. Yet the madneſs of Munſter, becauſe it was ſoon defeated, hath been caſt upon all believers through the world, who refuſed to put baptiſm before faith in Chriſt. And it is now ſaid, "In church government the Baptiſts have adopted the <hi>independent</hi> plan; the inconveniency of which they often experience, as it provides no
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:021663_0026_0FB501225B892DD8"/>final and deciſive judge of controverſy, nor tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to pronounce in hereſy or falſe doctrine. But the diſtinguiſhing characteriſtic of the baptiſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion is their excluding infant, and practiſing only adult baptiſm, and making it their great term of communion, excluding all other Chriſtians from the Lord's table among them, and not ſuffering their members to communicate with other church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. How they can acknowledge any other people to be a church of Chriſt, and yet continue this bar of ſeparation, is not to be accounted for; and we muſt leave them under the weight of this diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, until themſelves are pleaſed to remove it.<note n="*" place="bottom">Ibid. P. 48, 49.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Here all may ſee that it is much eaſier to charge others with inconſiſtency, than to act conſiſtently ourſelves. For theſe three laſt authors profeſs the doctrine of particular election and final perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, and yet they blame us, becauſe we dare not practically allow, that perſons may be brought into the covenant of grace without their own knowledge or choice, many of whom fall away and periſh forever. They alſo condemn the <hi>indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> plan of government in the church, though they celebrate it in the ſtate. But there can be no government in the ſtate if officers therein are not inveſted with power to compel delinquents to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to their lawful judgments; but the votes of officers in the church, are no more than the votes of the brethren, and the whole community have no more power in this reſpect than to exclude unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy members from their communion. And to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low miniſters a power of office in any church, which that church could not give, and cannot take away,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:021663_0027_0FB501290BD64600"/>is to make them <hi>lords over God's heritage,</hi> inſtead of being examples to the flock. We are ſo far from denying the viſible Chriſtianity of all who do not ſee with us about baptiſm, that we view it as a point of vaſt importance, that none ſhould be baptiſed but viſible Chriſtians. <hi>If any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his.</hi> Without it they are not Chriſtians; yet many contend with us becauſe we dare not ſay the contrary in practice. All who have received that Spirit, ought to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in water. Rom. vi. 4. viii. 9. Acts. x. 47, 48. I believe that the diſpenſing with the plain laws of Chriſt, and the forcibly impoſing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of men in his worſhip, is the ſcarlet col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oured beaſt which ſupports the whore of Babylon. It was, and is not, yet is. It will change into all ſhapes, as circumſtances and inclinations carry men. God hath many people in this myſterious city; but his voice from heaven is, <hi>Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her ſins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.</hi> The writings of the <hi>apoſtles,</hi> who have explained the <hi>prophets,</hi> and all centre in Jeſus Chriſt, is the only <hi>foundation</hi> of his church; and they will triumph over Babylon when ſhe falls. Eph. ii. 19. Rev. xvii. 3, 5, 8. xviii. 4, 20. Early warning was given, againſt grievous wolves, and perverſe ſchiſmatics; to avoid whom God, and the word of his grace is our only ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Acts xx. 29—32. The <hi>perfection</hi> of the holy ſcriptures is held up as what muſt be continued in, if we would get out of the perils which love to ſelf, under a form of godlineſs, hath brought upon theſe laſt days. 2 Tim. iii. 1—5, 14—17. In thoſe writings we have no mention of any inſtance
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:021663_0028_0FB5012AB9FDBBD0"/>of baptiſm without a perſonal profeſſion of faith and repentance; nor of any one who was admitted into the Chriſtian church without water baptiſm.</p>
            <p>The followers of George Fox, who have formed a large ſociety without it, have ſet up a rule in themſelves above the holy ſcriptures. A late writer of theirs, after attempting to excuſe George Fox for ſaying the ſoul was <hi>infinite,</hi> and trying to prove their opinion of an inward rule from the firſt chapter of the goſpel of John, without being able clearly to do it, ſaid, "Is not the apoſtle John's Greek as ordinary as G. Fox's Engliſh?"<note n="*" place="bottom">Phipps againſt Newton; reprinted at Philadelphia, 1783, P. 191, 203.</note> Thus he would ſet the leader of their ſect on a level with the oracles of God! And it is well known that the majority of them held with Great-Britain in her late bloody attempts againſt American liberty; and alſo are ſtrongly ſet againſt the doctrine of particular election and final perſeverance. And can any men be found upon earth, who deny that doctrine, and yet make conſcience of obeying the following plain rules of ſcripture? In Jeſus Chriſt, neither circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion availeth any thing, nor uncircumciſion, but faith which worketh by love. And they that are Chriſt's, have crucified the fleſh, with the affections and luſts. Bear ye one another's burdens, and ſo fulfil the law of Chriſt. Let him that is taught in the word, communicate unto him that teacheth, in all good things. For in Chriſt Jeſus neither circumciſion availeth any thing, nor uncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but a new creature. Gal. v. 6, 23. vi. 2, 6, 15, 16. God calls his covenant with Abraham, The covenant of circumciſion. And Abraham had
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:021663_0029_0FB5012C69723EA8"/>no right to circumciſe any ſtranger, until he had bought him as a ſervant with money. Acts vii. 8. Gen. xvii. 13. But the goſpel ſays to Zion, Ye ſhall be redeemed without money. Thy God reigneth. Iſaiah lii. 3, 7. Rom. x. 15. He pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed the church with his own blood. Acts xx. 28. And after he had done it, he ſaid, Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is nothing, and uncircumciſion is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God. Ye are bought with a price, be not ye the ſervants of men. I have written unto you, not to keep com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, if any man that is called a brother, be a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner, with ſuch an one, no not to eat. 1 Cor. v. 2. vii. 19, 23. Let no man deceive you with vain words; for becauſe of theſe things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of diſobedience. Be not ye therefore partakers with them. Have no fellowſhip with the unfruitful works of darkneſs, but rather reprove them. Eph. v. 6, 7, 11. Every tree is known by his own fruit; for of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble-buſh gather they grapes. A good man out of the good treaſure of his heart, bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treaſure of his heart, bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth ſpeaketh. And why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I ſay? Luke vi. 43—46. When the blade ſprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares alſo.—Let both grow together until the harveſt. The field is the world; the good ſeed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one. Mat. xiii. 26, 30, 38.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:021663_0030_0FB5013410E98760"/>
In theſe plain ſcriptures, the covenant of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion is repealed, by the name which God gave to it; and the church and world are clearly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, as two different judicatories; the one to exclude all who appear by their fruits to be forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cators, covetous, railers, drunkards, or extortioners, from their fellowſhip; the other to let them grow together with the children of the kingdom, in the world, until the end of it, only puniſhing ſuch as work ill to their neighbours. Rom. xiii. 1—10. And fighting and oaths are allowed of in this latter government. John xviii. 36. Heb. vi. 16. And wars will not fully come to an end, until the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhall freely receive the <hi>law from Zion,</hi> and <hi>guile</hi> ſhall be baniſhed from the church. A loud cry will then be heard, <hi>Babylon is fallen, is fallen.</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cah iv. 1—10. Rev. xiv. 1—8. The covenant of circumciſion will no more be called the covenant of grace, nor men be bewitched, as the Galatians were, with the practice of confounding works and grace together. God never injured Cain, in giving ſaving faith to Abel, nor the Midianites, who were of the ſeed of Abraham, in electing Iſrael for his church; neither did he injure Korah, or the child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren of Reuben, Jacob's firſt born, in electing Aaron and his lawful ſeed for prieſts: and he never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured any man in uniting the prieſtly and kingly offices in Jeſus Chriſt, and in ſouls who are born again, who are the only kings and prieſts in the goſpel church. Heb. v. 4—6. Rev. i. 5, 6. v. 10. And no others have any right to be members there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; and they all ought ever to be like little child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, inſtead of ſtriving who ſhould be the greateſt. Mat. xviii. 3, 4. None can have a right in the
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:021663_0031_0FB5013AE3FDA750"/>kingdom of God, who do not receive it as a little child. Mark x. 15. Such are glad of gifts. But Mr. Weſley has flatly denied that God could juſtly have paſſed him by, and not have given him pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in his will to believe, which is his notion of grace. Wages can be recovered by law, but a gift is beſtowed on whom, and in what manner the giver pleaſeth. Therefore God ſays, Is it not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil becauſe I am good? So the laſt ſhall be firſt, and the firſt laſt; for many are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but <hi>few choſen.</hi> Mat. xx. 15, 16.</p>
            <p>This is the true idea of <hi>election,</hi> which men have an amazing quarrel againſt. For if it depends en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely upon the <hi>will</hi> of God, whether he will ſave any of us, or not, then we can have no encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſet up our <hi>wills</hi> againſt him. If we do ſo, he can blaſt all our ſchemes as he pleaſeth; and when we come to die, he may then chuſe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he will hear our cries for mercy or not. Yea, he hath aſſured us that he will not hear our cries then, if we now <hi>delight in ſcorning, and hate know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi> Prov. i. 20—29. Giving diligence in the believing purſuit of virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, godlineſs, brotherly kindneſs and charity, is the only way to make our <hi>calling and election ſure;</hi> while heretics are <hi>ſelf-willed,</hi> under the name of <hi>liberty.</hi> 2 Peter i. 5—11. ii. 1, 10, 19. Our Lord hath ſet before us an example of <hi>great faith,</hi> which may encourage us in this purſuit. Luke vii. 1—9. Here obſerve,
<list>
                  <item>1. That this Roman centurion took all his encouragement from God, as he revealed himſelf in his Son, and none of it from any imaginary worthineſs in the creature. <hi>I
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:021663_0032_0FB5013CBABDE720"/>am not worthy that thou ſhouldſt enter under my roof; wherefore neither thought I myſelf worthy to come unto thee.</hi> Yet he believed that Jeſus, of his own infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite mercy, would grant relief.</item>
                  <item>2. He was careful to ſeek it in a lawful way; and before the death of Chriſt, it was <hi>unlawful</hi> for a member of that church to keep company with other nations. Acts x. 28. Therefore he would not violate the law of God, even to ſave life.</item>
                  <item>3. He believed that Jeſus could do it when abſent, as well as if he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. <hi>Say in a word, and my ſervant ſhall be healed.</hi> Herein his faith was much greater than the faith of Martha, Mary, or of Thomas the apoſtle. John xi. 21, 32. xx. 29. He clearly acted by faith, and not by ſight.</item>
                  <item>4. He made good uſe of his reaſon to ſtrengthen his faith, and not to weaken or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it, as is the caſe with multitudes.</item>
               </list>
He ſaid, <hi>I alſo am a man ſet under authority, having under me ſoldiers; and I ſay unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my ſervant, Do this, and he doth it.</hi> And if an unworthy ſinner, with a commiſſion from a heathen power, could be thus obeyed, what can be too hard for the Captain of our ſalvation!</p>
            <p>He took not on him the nature of angels, but the ſeed of Abraham, that through death he might deſtroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil, and deliver them who through fear of death were all their life-time ſubject to bondage. Every diſcovery of ſin and want ſhould ſpeed our flight to the throne of his grace, that we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain mercy and find grace to help in time of need. For he is able to ſave them to the uttermoſt, that come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:021663_0033_0FB5013E373D0590"/>make interceſſion for them. Heb. ii. 14—18. iv. 16. vii. 25. His only temple here below is in them who are <hi>poor, and of a contrite ſpirit, and tremble at his word.</hi> And if their brethren pretend a regard to the glory of God, in hating of them, and caſting them out, yet he ſays, I ſhall appear to your joy, and they ſhall be aſhamed. Iſaiah lxvi. 1—5. The firſt Chriſtian martyr ſealed this teſtimony with his blood. Acts vii. 48—51. And others overcame the great <hi>accuſer,</hi> by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their teſtimony, and they loved not their lives unto the death. And when their <hi>ſouls</hi> ſhall be raiſed, the devil will be bound, and be caſt into the bottomleſs pit, out of which the beaſt came who kills the two witneſſes. Rev. xi. 7. xii. 11. xx. 1—4. The word of God, both by Moſes and the Lamb, is as clear as <hi>glaſs,</hi> and as powerful as <hi>fire;</hi> and they who obtain the victory over the beaſt, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, ſtand and act joyfully upon the ſea of glaſs, mingled with fire. 2 Cor. iii. 18. Jer. xxiii. 29. Rev. xv. 2, 3. Covetouſneſs is idolatry. Col. iii. 5. And to deſtroy idolatry Elijah ſaid, How long halt ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two opinions? if the Lord be God, follow him; and if Baal, then follow him; which point was decided by <hi>fire from heaven.</hi> 1 Kings xviii. 21, 39. And way for the firſt coming of our Lord was prepared by a man who came in the <hi>Spirit and power of Elijah.</hi> Mal. iv. 1, 2, 5. Luke i. 17. And way for his ſecond coming will be prepared, by the raiſing of the <hi>ſouls</hi> of the old martyrs; which I think means the reſurrection of their <hi>Spirit and power in the churches.</hi> For God gave them not
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:021663_0034_0FB5014855024008"/>the ſpirit of fear, but of power, of love, and of a a ſound mind. 2 Tim. i. 7. Even ſuch love as to ſacrifice their lives, before they would violate any rule of truth or equity.</p>
            <p>All the world have now ſeen, that love is a vaſtly more powerful principle of action than fear. For as long as the Americans were afraid of deſtruction or ſlavery, their union and activity defeated all the attempts of their enemies; but no ſooner was that fear removed, than the love of riches, hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors and pleaſures, prevailed over contracts and oaths, and filled the land with diſcord, treachery and infidelity. By the love of money, vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers have erred from the truth, and pierced them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves through with many ſorrows. And our only remedy is, Not to truſt in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy. That we do good, that we be rich in good works, ready to diſtribute, willing to communicate; laying up in ſtore a good foundation againſt the time to come, that we may lay hold on eternal life. 1 Tim. vi. 9—19.</p>
