            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>TO GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE.</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>TO argue with a man who has renounced the uſe and authority of reaſon, and whoſe phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy conſiſts in holding humanity in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, is like adminiſtring medicine to the dead, or endeavouring to convert an Atheiſt by ſcripture. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, Sir, your inſenſibility of feeling and reflecting. It is the prerogative of animals. And no man will envy you thoſe honours, in which a ſavage only can be your rival and a bear your maſter.</p>
            <p>As the generoſity of this country rewarded your brother's ſervices laſt war with an elegant monument in Weſtminſter Abbey, it is conſiſtent that ſhe ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow ſome mark of diſtinction upon you. You certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſerve her notice, and a conſpicuous place in the catalogue of extraordinary perſons. Yet it would be pity to paſs you from the world in ſtate, and conſign you to magnificent oblivion among the tombs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out telling the future beholder why. Judas is as much known as John, yet hiſtory aſcribes their fame to very different actions.</p>
            <p>Sir William hath undoubtedly merited a monument: But of what kind, or with what inſcription, where placed or how embelliſhed, is a queſtion that would puzzle all the Heralds of St James's in the profoundeſt mood of hiſtorical deliberation. We are at no loſs, Sir, to aſcertain your real character, but ſomewhat perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how to perpetuate it's identity, and preſerve it
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:015951_0003_0F9B236F79003D48"/>
uninjured from the transformations of time or miſtake. A ſtatuary may give a falſe expreſſion to your buſt, or decorate it with ſome equivocal emblems, by which you may happen to ſteal into reputation and impoſe upon the hereafter traditionary world. Ill nature or ridicule may conſpire, or a variety of accidents com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine, to leſſen, enlarge, or change Sir William's fame; and no doubt but he who has taken ſo much pains to be ſingular in his conduct, would chooſe to be juſt as ſingular in his exit, his monument and his epitaph.</p>
            <p>The uſual honours of the dead, to be ſure, are not ſufficiently ſublime to eſcort a character like you to the republic of duſt and aſhes; for however men may differ in their ideas of grandeur or government here, the grave is nevertheleſs a perfect republic. Death is not the monarch of the dead, but of the dying. The moment he obtains a conqueſt he loſes a ſubject, and, like the fooliſh King you ſerve, will, in the end, war himſelf out of all dominion.</p>
            <p>As a proper preliminary towards the arrangement of your funeral honors, we readily admit your new rank of <hi>Knighthood.</hi> The title is perfectly in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and is your own, more by merit than creation. There are Knights of various orders from the Knight of the Windmill to the Knight of the Poſt. The former is your patron for exploits, and the latter will aſſiſt you in ſettling your accounts. No honorary ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle could be more happily applied! The ingenuity is ſublime! And your royal maſter hath diſcovered more genius in fitting you therewith, than in generating the moſt finiſhed figure for a button, or diſcanting on the properties of a button-mould.</p>
            <p>But how, Sir, ſhall we diſpoſe of you? The inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Statuary is exhauſted, and Sir William is yet unprovided with a monument. America is anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to beſtow her funeral favors upon you, and wiſhes to do it in a manner that ſhall diſtinguiſh you from all the deceaſed heroes of the laſt war. The <hi>Egyptian method of embalming</hi> is not known to the preſent age, and hieroglyphical pageantry hath out-lived the ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:015951_0004_0F9B23A338E1E7A8"/>
of decyphering it. Some other method, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, muſt be thought of to immortalize the new Knight of the Windmill and Poſt. Sir William, thanks to his ſtars, is not oppreſſed with very delicate ideas. He has no ambition of being wrapt up and handed about in myrrh, aloes and caſſia. Leſs charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able odors will ſuffice; and it fortunately happen<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, that the ſimple genius of America hath diſcovered the art of preſerving bodies and embelliſhing them to<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, with much greater frugality than the ancients. In a balmage, Sir, of humble tar, you will be as ſecure as Pharoah, and in a hieroglyphic of feathers rival in finery all the mummies of Egypt.</p>
            <p>As you have already made your exit from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral world, and by numberleſs acts both of paſſionate and deliberate injuſtice engraved an "HERE LYETH" on your deceaſed honor, it muſt be meer affectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in you to pretend concern at the humours or opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of mankind reſpecting you. What remains<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of you may expire at any time. The ſooner the better. For he who ſurvives his reputation, lives out of ſpite to himſelf, like a man liſtening to his own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.</p>
            <p>Thus entombed and ornamented I leave you to the inſpection of the curious, and return to the hiſtory of your yet ſurviving actions.—The character of Sir William hath undergone ſome extraordinary revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſince his arrival in America. It is now fix'd and known; and we have nothing to hope from your candor or to fear from your capacity. Indolence and inability have too large a ſhare in your compoſition ever to ſuffer you to be any thing more than the hero of little villainies and unfiniſhed adventures. That, which to ſome perſons appeared moderation in you at firſt, was not produced by any real virtue of your own, but by a contraſt of paſſions dividing and holding you in perpetual irreſolution. One vice will frequently expel another without the leaſt merit in the ma<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n, as powers in contrary directions reduce each other to reſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="unknown:015951_0005_0F9B23A3F967EC40"/>It became you, to have ſupported a dignified ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of character; to have ſhewn a ſuperior liberality of ſoul; to have won reſpect by an obſtinate perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in maintaining order, and to have exhibited, on all occaſions, ſuch an unchangeable graciouſneſs of conduct, that while we beheld in you the reſolution of an enemy we might admire in you the ſincerity of a man. You came to America under the high-ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing titles of Commander and Commiſſioner; not only to ſuppreſs what you called rebellion by arms, but to ſhame it out of countenance by the excellence of your example. Inſtead of which, you have been the patron of low and vulgar frauds, the encourager of Indian cruelties; and have imported a cargo of vices blacker than thoſe you pretended to ſuppreſs.</p>
            <p>Mankind are not univerſally agreed in their deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of right and wrong; but there are certain actions which the conſent of all nations and individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als hath branded with the unchangeable name of MEANNESS. In the liſt of human vices we find ſome of ſuch a refined conſtitution, that they cannot be carried into practice without ſeducing ſome virtue to their aſſiſtance; but <hi>meanneſs</hi> hath neither alliance nor apology. It is generated in the duſt and ſweepings of other vices, and is of ſuch a hateful figure that all the reſt conſpire to diſown it. Sir William, the Commiſſioner of George the Third, hath at laſt vouchſafed to give it rank and pedigree. He has placed the fugitive at the Council Board, and dubbed it companion of the order of knighthood.</p>
            <p>The particular act of meanneſs which I allude to in this deſcription, is forgery. You, Sir, have abetted and patroniſed the forging and uttering counterfeit continental bills. In the ſame New-York news-papers in which your own proclamation under your maſter's authority was publiſhed, offering, or pretending to offer, pardon and protection to the inhabitants of theſe States, there were repeated advertiſements of counterfeit money for ſale, and perſons who have come officially from you and under ſanction of your flag, have been taken up in attempting to put them off.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="unknown:015951_0006_0F9B23A4B9A2CA90"/>A conduct ſo baſely mean in a public character is without precedent or pretence. Every nation on earth, whether friends or enemies, will unite in deſpiſing you. 'Tis an incendiary war upon ſociety which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can excuſe or palliate—An improvement upon beggarly villainy—and ſhews an inbred wretchedneſs of heart made up between the venomous malignity of a ſerpent and the ſpiteful imbecility of an inferior reptile.</p>
            <p>The laws of any civilized country would condemn you to the gibbet without regard to your rank or titles, becauſe it is an action foreign to the uſage and cuſtom of war; and ſhould you fall into our hands, which pray God you may, it will be a doubtful mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whether we are to conſider you as a military pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner or a priſoner for felony.</p>
            <p>Beſides, it is exceedingly unwiſe and impolitic in you, or any perſons in the Engliſh ſervice, to promote, or even encourage, or wink at, the crime of forgery in any caſe whatever. Becauſe, as the riches of England, as a nation, is chiefly in paper, and the far greater part of trade among individuals is carried on by the ſame medium, that is, by notes and drafts on one another, they, therefore, of all people in the world ought to endeavour to keep forgery out of ſight, and, if poſſible, not to revive the idea of it. It is danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to make men familiar with a crime which they may afterwards practiſe to much greater advantage againſt thoſe who firſt taught them. Several officers in the Engliſh army have made their exit at the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows for forgery on their agents; for we all know, who know any thing of England, that there is not a more neceſſitous body of men, taking them generally, than what the Engliſh officers are. They contrive to make a ſhew at the expence of the taylor, and appear clean at the charge of the waſher-woman.</p>
            <p>England hath at this time nearly two hundred mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions pounds ſterling of public money in paper, for which ſhe hath no real property, beſides a large cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of bank notes, bank poſt bills, and promiſſary
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:015951_0007_0F9B23A579230B70"/>
notes and drafts of private bankers, merchants and tradeſmen. She hath the greateſt quantity of paper currency and the leaſt quantity of gold and ſilver of any nation in Europe; the real ſpecie, which is about ſixteen millions ſterling, ſerve only as change in large ſums, which are always made in paper, or for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in ſmall ones. Thus circumſtanced, the nation is put to its wit's ends, and obliged to be ſevere al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to criminality, to prevent the practice and growth of forgery. Scarcely a ſeſſion paſſes at the Old Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, or an execution at Tyburn, but witneſſeth this truth. Yet you, Sir, regardleſs of the policy which her neceſſity obliges her to adopt, have made your whole army intimate with the crime. And as all ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, at the concluſion of a war, are too apt to carry into practice the vices of the campaign, it will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably happen, that England will hereafter abound in forgeries, to which Art, the practitioners were firſt ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated under your authority in America. You, Sir, have the honor of adding a new vice to the military catalogue; and the reaſon, perhaps, why the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was reſerved for you, is, becauſe no General be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was mean enough even to think of it.</p>
            <p>That a man whoſe ſoul is abſorbed in the low traffic of vulgar vice, is incapable of moving in any ſuperior region, is clearly ſhewn in you by the event of every campaign. Your military exploits have been without plan, object or deciſion. Can it be poſſible that you or your employers can ſuppoſe the poſſeſſion of Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia to be any ways equal to the expence or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the nation which ſupports you? What advantages does England derive from any atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of yours? To <hi>her</hi> it is perfectly indifferent what place you are in, ſo long as the buſineſs of conqueſt is unperformed and the charge of maintaining you remains the ſame.</p>
            <p>If the principal events of the three campaigns be attended to, the balance will appear ſtrongly againſt you at the cloſe of each; but the laſt, in point of importance to us, hath exceeded the former two. It
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:015951_0008_0F9B23A71A89CED8"/>
is pleaſant to look back on dangers paſt, and equally as pleaſant to meditate on preſent ones when the way out begins to appear. <hi>That</hi> period is now arrived, and the long doubtful winter of war is changing to the ſweeter proſpects of victory and joy. At the cloſe of the cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign in ſeventy-five, you were obliged to retreat from Boſton. In the ſummer ſeventy-ſix, you appeared with, a numerous fleet and army in the harbour of New-York. By what miracle the Continent was preſerved in that ſeaſon of danger is a ſubject of admiration! If inſtead of waſting your time againſt Long-Iſland, you had run up the North River and landed any where above New-York, the conſequence muſt have been, that either you would have compelled General Waſhington to fight you with very unequal numbers, or he muſt have ſuddenly evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated the city with the loſs of nearly all the ſtores of the army, or have ſurrendered for want of proviſions, the ſituation of the place naturally producing one or other of theſe events.</p>
            <p>The preparations made to defend New-York were, nevertheleſs, wiſe and military; becauſe your forces were then at ſea, their numbers uncertain; ſtorms, ſickneſs, or a variety of accidents might have diſabled their coming, or ſo diminiſhed them on their paſſage, that thoſe which ſurvived would have been incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of opening the campaign with any proſpect of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; in which caſe, the defence would have been ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and the place preſerved; for cities that have been raiſed from nothing with an infinitude of labor and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, are not to be thrown away on the bare probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of their being taken. On theſe grounds, the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations made to maintain New-York were as judicious as the retreat afterwards. While you, in the interim, let ſlip the <hi>very</hi> opportunity which ſeemed to put conqueſt in your power.</p>
            <p>Through the whole of that campaign you had nearly double the forces which General Waſhington immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commanded. The principal plan, at that time, on our part, was to wear away the ſeaſon with as little loſs as poſſible, and to raiſe the army for the next year. Long-Iſland, New-York, Ports Waſhington and Lee were
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:015951_0009_0F9B23A7F46FE788"/>
not defended, after your ſuperior force was known, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any expectation of their being finally maintained, but as a range of out works, in the attacking of which, your time might be waſted, your numbers reduced, and your vanity amuſed by poſſeſſing them on our retreat. It was intended to have withdrawn the garriſon from Fort Waſhington after it had anſwered the former of thoſe purpoſes, but the fate of that day put a prize into your hands without much honour to yourſelves.</p>
            <p>Your progreſs through the Jerſeys was accidental; you had it not even in contemplation, or you would not have ſent ſo principal a part of your force to Rhode-Iſland be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand. The utmoſt hope of America in the year ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty-ſix reached no higher than that ſhe might not <hi>then</hi> be conquered. She had no expectation of defeating you in that campaign. Even the moſt cowardly Tory allowed, that, could ſhe withſtand the ſhock of <hi>that</hi> ſummer her independence would be paſt a doubt. You had <hi>then</hi> great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the advantage of her. You were formidable. Your military knowledge was ſuppoſed to be compleat. Your fleets and forces arrived without an accident. You had neither experience nor reinforcements to wait for. You had nothing to do but to begin, and your chance lay in the firſt vigorous onſet.</p>
            <p>America was young and unſkilled. She was obliged to truſt her defence to time and practice; and hath, by meer dint of perſeverance, maintained her cauſe, and brought her enemy to a condition, in which, ſhe is now capable of meeting him on any grounds.</p>
            <p>It is remarkable that in the campaign of ſeventy-ſix, you gained no more, notwithſtanding your great force, than what was given you by conſent or evacuation, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Fort Waſhington: While every advantage obtained by us was by fair and hard fighting. The defeat of Sir Peter Parker was compleat. The conqueſt of the Heſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans at Trenton by the remains of a retreating army, which, but a few days before, you affected to deſpiſe, is an inſtance of heroic perſeverance very ſeldom to be met with. And the victory over the Britiſh troops at Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, by a harraſſed and wearied party, who had been engaged the day before and marched all night without refreſhment, is attended with ſuch a ſcene of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:015951_0010_0F9B23A878CD9488"/>
and ſuperiority of Generalſhip, as will ever give it a place on the firſt line in the hiſtory of great actions.</p>
            <p>When I look back on the gloomy days of laſt winter and ſee America ſuſpended by a thread, I feel a triumph of joy at the recollection of her delivery, and a reverence for the characters which ſnatched her from deſtruction. To doubt <hi>now</hi> would be a ſpecies of infidelity, and to forget the inſtruments which ſaved us <hi>then</hi> would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude.</p>
            <p>The cloſe of that campaign left us with the ſpirits of conquerors. The Northern diſtricts were relieved by the retreat of General Carleton over the lakes. The army under your command were hunted back and had their bounds preſcribed. The Continent began to feel its mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary importance, and the winter paſſed pleaſantly away in preparations for the next campaign.</p>
            <p>However confident you might be on your firſt arrival, the courſe of the year ſeventy-ſix gave you ſome idea of the difficulty, if not impoſſibility, of conqueſt. To this reaſon I aſcribe your delay in opening the campaign in ſeventy-ſeven. The face of matters, on the cloſe of the former year, gave you no encouragement to purſue a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretionary war as ſoon as the ſpring admitted the taking the field; for though conqueſt, in that caſe, would have given you a double portion of ſame, yet the experiment was too hazardous. The Miniſtry, had you failed, would have ſhifted the whole blame upon you, charged you with having acted without orders, and condemned at once both your plan and your execution.</p>
            <p>To avoid thoſe misfortunes, which might have involved you and your money accounts in perplexity and ſuſpicion, you prudently waited the arrival of a plan of operations from England, which was, that you ſhould proceed for Philadelphia by the way of Cheſapeak, and that Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goyne, after reducing Ticonderoga, ſhould take his route by Albany, and, if neceſſary, join you.</p>
            <p>The ſplendid laurels of the laſt campaign have flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in the North. In that quarter America hath ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized the world, and laid the foundation of her this year's glory. The conqueſt of Ticonderoga (if it may be called a conqueſt) has, like all your other victories,
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:015951_0011_0F9B23A938E21688"/>
led on to ruin. Even the proviſions taken in that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, (which by General Burgoyne's return was ſufficient in bread and flour for nearly 5000 men for ten weeks, and in beef and pork for the ſame number of men for one month) ſerved only to haſten his overthrow, by enabling him to proceed for Saratoga the place of his deſtruction. A ſhort review of the operations of the laſt campaign will ſhew the condition of affairs on both ſides.</p>
            <p>You have taken Ticonderoga and marched into Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia. Theſe are all the events which the year hath produced on your part. A trifling campaign indeed, compared with the expences of England and the conqueſt of the Continent. On the other ſide, a conſiderable part of your Northern force has been routed by the New-York militia under General Herkimer. Fort Stanwix hath bravely ſurvived a compounded attack of ſoldiers and ſavages, and the beſiegers have fled. The battle of Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nington has put a thouſand priſoners into our hands, with all their arms, ſtores, artillery and baggage. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Burgoyne in two engagements has been defeated; himſelf, his army, and all that were his and theirs are now ours. Ticonderoga and Independence are retaken, and not the ſhadow of an enemy remains in all the Northern diſtricts. At this inſtant we have upwards of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thouſand priſoners, between ſixty and ſeventy pieces of braſs ordnance, beſides ſmall arms, tents, ſtores, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In order to know the real value of thoſe advantages we muſt reverſe the ſcene, and ſuppoſe General Gates, and the force he commanded, to be at your mercy as pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, and General Burgoyne with his army of ſoldiers and ſavages to be already joined to you in Pennſylvania. So diſmal a picture can ſcarcely be looked at. It hath all the traces and colourings of horror and deſpair; and excites the moſt ſwelling emotions of gratitude by exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting the miſeries we are ſo graciouſly preſerved from.</p>
            <p>I admire this diſtribution of laurels around the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. It is the earneſt of future union. South-Carolina has had her day of ſuffering and of fame; and the other Southern States have exerted themſelves in proportion to the force that invaded or inſulted them. Towards the cloſe of the campaign in ſeventy-ſix, theſe middle States
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:015951_0012_0F9B23A9FAECD6C0"/>
were called upon and did their duty nobly. They were witneſſes to the almoſt expiring flame of human freedom. It was the cloſe ſtruggle of life and death. The line of inviſible diviſion; and on which, the unabated fortitude of a Waſhington prevailed, and ſaved the ſpark, that has ſince blazed in the North with unrivalled luſtre.</p>
            <p>Let me aſk, Sir, what great exploits have you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed? Through all the variety of changes and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities which this war hath produced, I know no one action of yours that can be ſtiled maſterly. You have moved in and out, backward and forward, round and round, as if valor conſiſted in a military jig. The hiſtory and figure of your movements would be truly ridiculous could they be juſtly delineated. They reſemble the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors of a puppy purſuing his tail; the end is ſtill at the ſame diſtance, and all the turnings round muſt be done over again.</p>
            <p>The firſt appearance of affairs at Ticonderoga wore ſuch an unpromiſing aſpect, that it was neceſſary, in July, to detach a part of the forces to the ſupport of that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which were otherwiſe deſtined or intended to act againſt you, and this, perhaps, has been the means of poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poning your downfal to another campaign. The deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one army at a time is work enough. We know, Sir, what we are about, what we have to do, and how to do it.</p>
            <p>Your progreſs from Cheſapeak was marked by no ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital ſtroke of policy or heroiſm. Your principal aim was to get General Waſhington between the Delaware and Schuylkill and between Philadelphia and your army. In that ſituation, with a river on each of his flanks, which united about five miles below the city, and your army above him, you could have intercepted his rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcements and ſupplies, cut off all his communication with the country, and, if neceſſary, have diſpatched aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance to open a paſſage for General Burgoyne. This ſcheme was too viſible to ſucceed, for had General Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington ſuffered you to command the open country above him, I think it a very reaſonable conjecture that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of Burgoyne would not have taken place, becauſe you could, in that caſe, have relieved him. It was therefore
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:015951_0013_0F9B23AAB9406328"/>
neceſſary, while that important victory was in ſuſpence, to trepan <hi>you</hi> into a ſituation, in which you could only be on the defenſive without the power of affording him aſſiſtance. The manoeuvre had its effect and Burgoyne was conquered.</p>
            <p>There has been ſomething unmilitarily paſſive in you from the time of your paſſing the Schuylkill and getting poſſeſſion of Philadelphia to the cloſe of the campaign. You miſtook a trap for a conqueſt, the probability of which has been made known to Europe, and the edge of your triumph taken off by our own information long before.</p>
            <p>Having got you into this ſituation, a ſcheme for a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral attack upon you at Germantown was carried into execution on the fourth of October, and though the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs was not equal to the excellence of the plan, yet the attempting it proved the genius of America to be on the riſe and her power approaching to ſuperiority The obſcurity of the morning was your beſt friend, for a fog is always favorable to a hunted enemy. Some weeks after this, you, likewiſe, planned an attack on General Waſhington while at Whitemarſh, marched out with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite parade, but on finding him preparing to attack you the next morning, you prudently cut about and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to Philadelphia with all the precipitation of a man conquered in imagination.</p>
            <p>Immediatly after the battle of Germantown, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of Burgonye's defeat gave a new policy to affairs in Penſylvania, and it was judged moſt conſiſtent with the general ſafety of America to wait the iſſue of the Northern campaign. Slow and ſure is ſound work. The news of that victory arrived in our camp on the 18th of October, and no ſooner did the ſhout of joy and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the thirteen cannon reach your ears, than you reſolved upon a retreat, and the next day, that is, on the 19th, withdrew your drooping army into Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia. This movement was evidently dictated by fear; and carried with it a poſitive confeſſion that you dreaded a ſecond attack. It was hiding yourſelf among women and children, and ſleeping away the choiceſt part of a campaign in expenſive inactivity. An army in a city can
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:015951_0014_0F9B23AB78EA7328"/>
never be a conquering army. The ſituation admits only of defence. It is meer ſhelter; and every military pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in Europe will conclude you to be eventually defeated.</p>
            <p>The time when you made this retreat was the very time you ought to have fought a battle, in order to put yourſelf in a condition of recovering in Pennſylvania what you had loſt at Saratoga. And the reaſon why you did not, muſt be either prudence or cowardice; the former ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes your inability, and the latter needs no explanation. I draw no concluſions, Sir, but ſuch as are naturally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from known and viſible facts, and ſuch as will always have a being while the facts which produced them remain unaltered.</p>
            <p>After this retreat a new difficulty aroſe which exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited the power of Britain in a very contemptible light, which was the attack and defence of Mud-Iſland. For ſeveral weeks did that little unfiniſhed fortreſs ſtand out againſt all the attempts of Admiral and General Howe. It was the fable of Bender realized on the Delaware. Scheme after ſcheme and force upon force were tried and defeated. The garriſon, with ſcarce any thing to cover them but their bravery, ſurvived in the midſt of mud, ſhot and ſhells, and were at laſt obliged to give it up more to the powers of time and gun-powder than to the military ſuperiority of the beſiegers.</p>
            <p>It is my ſincere opinion that matters are in a much worſe condition with you than what is generally known. Your maſter's ſpeech at the opening of Parliament is like a ſoliloquy on ill luck. It ſhews him to be coming a little to his reaſon, for ſenſe of pain is the firſt ſymptom of recovery in profound ſtupefactions. His condition is deplorable. He is obliged to ſubmit to all the inſults of France and Spain without daring to know or reſent them, and thankful for the moſt trivial evaſions to the moſt humble remonſtrances. The time <hi>was</hi> when he could not <hi>deign</hi> an anſwer to a petition from America, and the time now <hi>is</hi> when he dare not <hi>give</hi> an anſwer to an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front from France. The capture of Burgoyne's army will ſink his conſequence as much in Europe as in America. In his ſpeech he expreſſes his ſuſpicions at the warlike preparations of France and Spain, and as he has only
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:015951_0015_0F9B23AC3A653030"/>
the one army which you command to ſupport his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter in the world with, it remains very uncertain when, or in what quarter, it will be moſt wanted or can be beſt employed, and this will partly account for the great care you take to keep it from action and attacks, for ſhould Burgoyne's fate be yours, which it probably will, England may take her endleſs farewell not only of all America but of all the Weſt-Indies.</p>
            <p>Never did a nation invite deſtruction upon itſelf with the eagerneſs and ignorance with which Britain has done. Bent upon the ruin of a young and unoffending country, ſhe hath drawn the ſword that hath wounded herſelf to the heart, and in the agony of her reſentment hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied a poiſon for a cure. Her conduct towards America is a compound of rage and lunacy; ſhe aims at the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of it, yet preſerves neither dignity nor cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter in her methods to obtain it. Were government a mere manufacture or article of commerce immaterial by whom it ſhould be made or ſold, we might as well em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy her as another, but when we conſider it as the fountain from whence the general manners and morality of a country take their riſe, that the perſons entruſted with the execution thereof are by their ſerious example and authority to ſupport theſe principles, how abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly abſurd is the idea of being hereafter governed by a ſet of men who have been guilty of forgery, perjury, treachery, theft, and every ſpecies of villainy which the loweſt wretches on earth could practiſe or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. What greater public curſe can befal any country than to be under ſuch authority, and what greater bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than to be delivered therefrom. The ſoul of any man of ſentiment would riſe in brave rebellion againſt them and ſpurn them from the earth.</p>
            <p>The malignant and venemous tempered Gen. Vaughan has amuſed his ſavage fancy in burning the whole own of Kingſton, in York government, and the late Governor of that State, Mr. Tryon, in his letter to General Parſons, has endeavoured to juſtify it, and declared his wiſh to burn the houſes of every Committee-man in the country. Such a confeſſion from one who was once entruſted with the powers of civil government, is a reproach to the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:015951_0016_0F9B23ACF9C1C058"/>
But it is the wiſh and the declaration of a man whom anguiſh and diſappointment have driven to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, and who is daily decaying into the grave with conſtitutional rottenneſs.</p>
            <p>There is not in the compaſs of language a ſufficiency of words to expreſs the baſeneſs of your King, his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry and his Army. They have refined upon villainy till it wants a name. To the fiercer vices of former ages they have added the dregs and ſcummings of the moſt finiſhed raſcality, and are ſo compleatly ſunk in ſerpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine deceit, that there is not left among them <hi>one</hi> gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous enemy.</p>
            <p>From ſuch men and ſuch maſters may the gracious hand of Heaven preſerve America! And though the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings ſhe now endures are heavy and ſevere, they are like ſtraws in the wind compared to the weight of evils ſhe would feel under the government of your King, and his penſioned Parliament.</p>
            <p>There is ſomething in meanneſs which excites a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of reſentment that never ſubſides, and ſomething in cruelty which ſtirs up the heart to the higheſt agony of human hatred; Britain hath filled up both theſe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters till no addition can be made, and hath not repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation left with us to obtain credit for the ſlighteſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. The will of God hath parted us, and the deed is regiſtered for eternity. When ſhe ſhall be a ſpot ſcarcely viſible among the nations, America ſhall flouriſh the favorite of Heaven and the friend of mankind.</p>
            <p>For the domeſtic happineſs of Britain and the peace of the world I wiſh ſhe had not a foot of land but what is circumſcribed within her own iſland. Extent of domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath been her ruin, and inſtead of civilizing others hath brutalized herſelf. Her late reduction of India under Clive and his ſucceſſors, was not ſo properly a conqueſt as an extermination of mankind. She is the only power who could practiſe the prodigal barbarity of tying men to the mouths of loaded cannon and blowing them away. It happens that General Burgoyne, who made the report of that horrid tranſaction in the Houſe of Commons, is now a priſoner with us, and though an enemy, I can appeal to him for the truth of it, being
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:015951_0017_0F9B23ADB8C971F0"/>
confident that he neither can nor will deny it. Yet Clive received the approbation of the laſt Parliament.</p>
            <p>When we take a ſurvey of mankind we cannot help curſing the wretch, who, to the unavoidable misfortunes of nature ſhall wilfully add the calamities of war. One would think there were evils enough in the world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtudying to increaſe them, and that life is ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhort without ſhaking the ſand that meaſures it. The hiſtories of Alexander, and Charles of Sweden, are the hiſtories of human devils; a good man cannot think of their actions without abhorrence nor of their deaths without rejoicing. To ſee the bounties of Heaven de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, the beautiful face of nature laid waſte, and the choiceſt works of creation and art tumbled into ruin, would fetch a curſe from the ſoul of piety itſelf. But in this country the aggravation is heightened by a new combination of affecting circumſtances. America was young, and, compared with other counties, was virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. None but a Herod of uncommon malice would have made war upon infancy and innocence, and none but a people of the moſt finiſhed fortitude dared, under thoſe circumſtances, have reſiſted the tyranny. The natives, or their anceſtors, had fled from the former op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of England, and with the induſtry of bees had changed a wilderneſs into a habitable world. To Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain they were indebted for nothing. The country was the gift of Heaven, and God alone is their Lord and Sovereign.</p>
            <p>The time, Sir, will come when you, in a melancholy hour, ſhall reckon up your miſeries by your murders in America. Life, with you, begins to wear a clouded aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect. The viſion of pleaſurable deluſion is wearing away, and changing to the barren wild of age and ſorrow. The poor reflection of having ſerved your King will yield you no conſolation in your parting moments He will crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the ſame undiſtinguiſhed aſhes with yourſelf, and have ſins enough of his own to anſwer for. It is not the farcical benedictions of a Biſhop, nor the cringing hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy of a court of Chaplains, nor the formality of an act of Parliament, that can change guilt into innocence, or make the puniſhment <hi>one</hi> pang the leſs. You may,
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:015951_0018_0F9B23AE7ACECB58"/>
perhaps, be unwilling to be ſerious, but this deſtruction of the goods of Providence, this havoc of the human <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, and this ſowing the world with miſchief, muſt be accounted for to him who made and governs it. To us they are only preſent ſufferings, but to him they are deep rebellions.</p>
            <p>If there is a ſin ſuperior to every other it is that of willful and offenſive war. Moſt other ſins are circumſcribed within narrow limits, that is, the power of <hi>one</hi> man cannot give them a very general extenſion, and many kind of ſins have only a mental exiſtence from when no infection ariſes; but he who is the author of a war, lets looſe the whole contagion of Hell, and opens a vein that bleeds a nation to death. We leave it to England and Indians to boaſt of theſe honors; we feel no thirſt for ſuch ſavage glory; a nobler flame, a purer ſpirit animates America. She hath taken up the ſword of virtuous defence; ſhe hath bravely put herſelf between Tyranny and Freedom, between a curſe and a bleſſing, determined to expel the one, and protect the other.</p>
            <p>It is the object only of war that makes it honorable And if there were ever <hi>a juſt</hi> war ſince the world began, it is this which America is now engaged in. She invaded no land of yours. She hired no mercenaries to burn your towns, nor Indians to maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre their inhabitants. She wanted nothing from you and was indebted for nothing to you; and thus circumſtanced, her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence is honorable and her proſperity certain.</p>
            <p>Yet it is not on the <hi>juſtice</hi> only, but likewiſe on the <hi>import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> of this cauſe that I ground my ſeeming enthuſiaſtical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of our ſucceſs. The vaſt extenſion of America makes her of too much value in the ſcale of Providence, to be caſt, like a pearl before ſwine, at the feet of a European iſland; and of much leſs conſequence would it be that Britain were ſunk in the ſea than that America ſhould miſcarry. There has been ſuch a chain of extraordinary events in the diſcovery of this country at firſt, in the peopling and planting it afterwards, in the rearing and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> it to its preſent State, and in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of it through the preſent war, that no man can doubt, but Providence hath ſome nobler end to accompliſh than the gratification of the petty Elector of Hanover or the ignorant and inſignificant King of Britain.</p>
            <p>As the blood of the martyrs hath been the ſeed of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Church, ſo the political perſecutions of England will, and
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:015951_0019_0F9B23AF390968F0"/>
hath already enriched America with induſtry, experience, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and importance. Before the preſent aera ſhe was a meer chaos of uncemented Colonies, individually expoſed to the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages of the Indians and the invaſion of any power that Britain ſhould be at war with. She had nothing ſhe could call her own. Her felicity depended upon accident. The convulſions of Europe might have thrown her from one conqueror to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till ſhe had been the ſlave of all and ruined by every one; for until ſhe had ſpirit enough to become her own maſter, there was no knowing to which maſter ſhe ſhould belong. <hi>That</hi> pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, thank God, is paſt, and ſhe is no longer the dependent, diſunited Colonies of Britain, but the independent and united States of America, knowing no maſter but Heaven and herſelf. You or your King may call this "Deluſion," "Rebellion," or what name you pleaſe. To us it is perfectly indifferent. The iſſue will determine the character and Time will give it a name as laſting as his own.</p>
            <p>You have now, Sir, tried the fate of three campaigns, and can fully declare to England, that nothing is to be got on your part but blows and broken bones, and nothing on hers but waſte of trade and credit and an encreaſe of poverty and taxes. You are now only where you might have been two years ago without the loſs of a ſingle ſhip, and yet not a ſtep the forwarder towards the conqueſt of the Continent; becauſe, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready hinted, "An army in a city can never be a conquering army." The full amount of your loſſes ſince the beginning of the war exceeds twenty thouſand men, beſides millions of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for which you have nothing in exchange. Our expences, though great, are circulated within ourſelves. Yours is a direct ſinking of money, and that from both ends at once, firſt in hiring troops out of the nation, and in paying them afterwards, becauſe the money in neither caſe can return again to Britain. We are already in poſſeſſion of the prize, you only in ſuit for it. To us it is a real treaſure, to you it would be only an empty triumph. Our expences will repay themſelves with ten fold intereſt, while yours entail upon you everlaſting poverty.</p>
            <p>Take a review, Sir, of the ground you have gone over, and let it teach you policy, if it cannot honeſty. You ſtand but on a very tottering foundation. A charge of the Miniſtry in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land may probably bring your meaſures into queſtion and your head to the block. Clive, with all his ſucceſſes, had ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:015951_0020_0F9B23AFF8BB1240"/>
in eſcaping, and yours being all a war of loſſes, will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford you leſs pretenſions and your enemies more grounds for impeachment.</p>
            <p>Go home, Sir, and endeavor to ſave the remains of your ruined country by a juſt repreſentation of the madneſs of her meaſures. A few moments well applied may yet preſerve her from political deſtruction. I am not one of thoſe who wiſh to ſee Europe in a flame, becauſe I am perſuaded ſuch an event will not ſhorten the war. The rupture, at preſent, is confined between the two powers of America and England. England finds ſhe cannot conquer America, and America has no wiſh to conquer England. You are fighting for what you can never obtain, and we defending what we mean never to part with. A few words, therefore, ſettle the bargain. Let England mind her own buſineſs and we will mind ours. Govern yourſelves and we will govern ourſelves. You may then trade where you pleaſe unmoleſted by us, and we will trade where we pleaſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moleſted by you; and ſuch articles as we can purchaſe of each other better than elſewhere may be mutually done. If it were poſſible that you could carry on the war for twenty years you muſt ſtill come to this point at laſt, or worſe, and the ſooner you think of it the better it will be for you.</p>
            <p>My official ſituation enables me to know the repeated inſults which Britain is obliged to put up with from foreign powers, and the wretched ſhifts ſhe is driven to, to gloſs them over. Her reduced ſtrength and exhauſted coffers in a three years war with America have given a powerful ſuperiority to France and Spain. She is not now a match for them—But if neither counſels can prevail on her to think, nor ſufferings awaken her to reaſon, ſhe muſt e'en go on, till the honor of England becomes a proverb of contempt, and Europe dub her the Land of Fools.</p>

            <head>TO THE INHABITANTS OF AMERICA.</head>
            <p>WITH all the pleaſure with which a man exchanges bad company for good, I take my leave of Sir William and return to you. It is now nearly three years ſince the tyranny of Britain received its firſt repulſe by the arms of America. A period, which has given birth to a new world and erected a monument to the folly of the old.</p>
            <p>I cannot help being ſometimes ſurpriſed at the complimentary references which I have ſeen and heard made to ancient hiſtories and tranſactions. The wiſdom, civil governments, and ſenſe of honor of the States of Greece and Rome, are frequently held up as objects of excellence and imitation. Mankind have lived for very little purpoſe, if, at this period of the world, they muſt go two or three thouſand years back for leſſons and examples. We do diſhonorary injuſtice to ourſelves by placing them in ſuch a ſuperior line. We have no juſt authority for it, neither can we tell why it is that we ſhould ſuppoſe ourſelves inferior.</p>
            <p>Could the miſt of antiquity be taken away, and men and things viewed as they then really were, it is more than proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that they would admire us, rather than we them. America has ſurmounted a greater variety and combination of difficulties than, I believe, ever ſell to the ſhare of any one people in the ſame ſpace of time, and has repleniſhed the world with more uſeful knowledge and founder maxims of civil government than were ever produced in any age before. Had it not been for Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica there had been no ſuch thing as freedom left throughout the whole univerſe. England hath loſt hers in a long chain of right reaſoning from wrong principles, and it is from this country now ſhe muſt learn the reſolution to redreſs herſelf, and the wiſdom Low.</p>
            <p>The Grecians and Romans were ſtrongly poſſeſſed of the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of liberty but <hi>not</hi> the <hi>principle,</hi> for at the time they were determined not to be ſlaves themſelves, they employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their power to enſlave the reſt of mankind. But this diſtinguiſhed aera is blotted by no one miſanthropical vice. In ſhort, if the principle on which the cauſe is founded, the univerſal bleſſings that are to ariſe from it, the difficulties that accompanied it, the wiſdom with which it has been debated, the fortitude by which it has been ſupported, the ſtrength of the power we had to oppoſe, and the condition in which we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:015951_0022_0F9B23B178C416D8"/>
it, be all taken in one view, we may juſtly ſtile it the moſt virtuous and illuſtrious revolution that ever graced the hiſtory of mankind.</p>
            <p>A good opinion of ourſelves is exceedingly neceſſary in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate life, but abſolutely neceſſary in public life, and of the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt importance in ſupporting natural character. I have no notion of yielding the palm of the United States to any Grecians or Romans that were ever born. We have equalled the braveſt in times of danger, and excelled the wiſeſt in the conſtruction of civil governments, <hi>no one in America excepted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this agreeable eminence let us take a review of preſent affairs. The ſpirit of corruption is ſo inſeparably interwoven with Britiſh politics, that their Miniſtry ſuppoſe all mankind are governed by the ſame motive. They have no idea of a people ſubmitting even to temporary inconvenience from an attachment to rights and privileges. Their plans of buſineſs are calculated <hi>by</hi> the hour and <hi>for</hi> the hour, and are uniform in nothing but the corruption which gives them birth. They never had, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have they at this time, any regular plan for the conqueſt of America by arms. They know not how to go about it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have they power to effect it if they could know. The thing is not within the compaſs of human practicability, for America is too extenſive either to be fully conquered or <hi>paſſively</hi> defended. But ſhe may be <hi>actively</hi> defended by defeating or mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing priſoners of the army that invades her. And this is the only ſyſtem of defence that can be effectual in a large country.</p>
            <p>There is ſomething in a war carried on by invaſion which makes it differ in circumſtances from any other mode of war, becauſe he who conducts it cannot tell whether the ground he gains, be for him, or againſt him, when he firſt makes it. In the winter ſeventy ſix General Howe marched with an air of victory through the Jerſeys, the conſequence of which was his defeat and General Burgoyne at Saratega experienced the ſame fate from the ſame cauſe. The Spaniards about two years ago were defeated by the Algerines in the ſame manner, that is, their firſt triumphs became a trap in which they were totally routed. And whoever will attend to the circumſtances and events of a war carried on by invaſion, will find, that any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vader, in order to be finally conquered muſt firſt begin to conquer.</p>
            <p>I confeſs myſelf one of thoſe who believe the loſs of Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia to be attended with more advantages than injuries. The
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:015951_0023_0F9B23B239BB9638"/>
caſe ſtood thus. The enemy imagined Philadelphia to be of more importance to us than it really was; for we all know that it had long ceaſed to be a port, not a cargo of goods had been brought into it for near a twelve month, nor any fix'd manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factories, nor even ſhip building carried on in it; yet as the enemy believed the conqueſt of it to be practicable, and to that belief added the abſurd idea that the ſoul of all America was centered there and would be conquered there, it naturally fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that their poſſeſſion of it, by not anſwering the end propoſed, muſt break up the plans they had ſo fooliſhly gone upon, and either oblige them to form a new one, for which their preſent ſtrength is not ſufficient, or to give over the attempt.</p>
            <p>We never had ſo ſmall an army to fight againſt, nor ſo fair an opportunity of final ſucceſs as <hi>now.</hi> The death wound is already given. The day is our own if we follow it up. The enemy by his ſituation is within our reach, and by his reduced ſtrength is within our power. The Miniſters of Britain may rage as they pleaſe, but our part is to conquer their armies. Let them wrangle and welcome, but let it not draw our atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the <hi>one</hi> thing needful. <hi>Here,</hi> in <hi>this</hi> ſpot is our buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be accompliſhed, our felicity ſecured. What we have now to do is as clear as light, and the way to do it is as ſtrait as a line. It needs not to be commented upon, yet, in order to be perfectly underſtood, I will put a caſe that cannot admit of a miſtake.</p>
            <p>Had the armies under the Generals Howe and Burgoyne been united and taken poſt at Germantown, and had the Northern army under General Gates been joined to that under General Waſhington at Whitemarſh, the conſequence would have been a general action; and if in that action we had killed and taken the ſame number of officers and men, that is, between nine and ten thouſand, with the ſame quantity of artillery, arms, ſtores, &amp;c. as have been taken to the Northward, and obliged General Howe with the remains of his army, that is, with the ſame number he now commands, to take ſhelter in Philadelphia, we ſhould certainly have thought ourſelves the greateſt heroes in the world; and ſhould, as ſoon as the ſeaſon permitted, have collected together all the force of the Continent and laid ſiege to the city, for it requires a much greater force to beſiege an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in a town than to defeat them in the field. The caſe <hi>now</hi> is juſt the ſame as if it had been produced by the means I have
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:015951_0024_0F9B23B2F94C4A08"/>
here ſuppoſed. Between nine and ten thouſand have been killed and taken, all their ſtores are in our poſſeſſion, and General Howe, in conſequence of that victory, has thrown himſelf for ſhelter into Philadelphia He, or his trifling friend Galloway, may form what pretences they pleaſe, yet no juſt reaſon can be given for their going into winter quarters ſo early as the 19th of October, but their apprehenſion of a defeat if they continued out, or their conſcious inability of keeping the field with ſafety. I ſee no advantage which can ariſe to America by hunting the enemy from State to State It is a triumph without a prize, and wholly unworthy the attention of a people determined to conquer. Neither can any State promiſe itſelf ſecurity while the enemy remain in a condition to tranſport themſelves from one part of the Continent to another. Howe likewiſe, cannot conquer where we have no army to oppoſe, therefore any ſuch removals in him are mean and cowardly, and reduces Britain to a common pilſerer. If he retreats from Philadelphia, he will be deſpiſed; if he ſtays, he may be ſhut up and ſtarved out, and the country, if he advances into it, may become his Saratoga. He has his choice of evils and we of opportunities. If he moves early, it is not only a ſign but a proof that he expects no rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement, and his delays will prove that he either waits for the arrival of a plan to go upon, or force to execute it, or both; in <hi>which</hi> caſe, our ſtrength will encreaſe more than his, therefore in <hi>any</hi> caſe we cannot be wrong if we do but proceed</p>
            <p>The particular condition of Pennſylvania deſerves the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the other States. Her military ſtrength muſt not be eſtimated by the number of inhabitants. Here are men of all nations, characters, profeſſions and intereſts. Here are the firmeſt Whigs, ſurviving like ſparks in the ocean<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unquenched and uncooled in the midſt of diſcouragement and diſaffection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Here are men loſing their all with chearfulneſs, and collecting <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and fortitude from the flames of their own eſtates. Here are others ſkulking in ſecret, many making a market of the times, and numbers who are changing Whig and Tory with the circumſtances or every day.</p>
            <p>It is by meer dint of fortitude and perſeverance that the Whigs of this State have been able to maintain ſo good a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and do even what they have <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. We want help, and the ſooner it can arrive the more effectual it will be. The invaded State, be it which it may, will always feel and additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:015951_0025_0F9B23B3B9F320F8"/>
burthen upon its back, and be hard ſet to ſupport its civil power with ſufficient authority: and this difficulty will always riſe or fall, in proportion as the other States throw in their aſſiſtance to the common cauſe.</p>
            <p>The enemy will moſt probably make many manoeuvres at the opening of this campaign, to amuſe and draw off the attention of the ſeveral States from the <hi>one thing needful.</hi> We may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to hear of alarms and pretended expeditions to <hi>this</hi> place and <hi>that</hi> place, to the Southward, the Eaſtward and the Northward, all intended to prevent our forming into one for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable body. The leſs the enemy's ſtrength is, the more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleties of this kind will they make uſe of. Their exiſtence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon it, becauſe the force of America, when collected, is ſufficient to ſwallow their preſent army up. It is therefore our buſineſs to make ſhort work of it, by bending our whole attention to <hi>this one principal point,</hi> for the inſtant that the main body under General Howe is defeated, all the inferior alarms throughout the Continent, like ſo many ſhadows, will follow his downfall.</p>
            <p>The only way to finiſh a war with the leaſt poſſible bloodſhed, or perhaps without any, is to collect an army, againſt the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of which, the enemy ſhall have no chance. By not doing this, we prolong the war, and double both the calamities and the expences of it. What a rich and happy country would America be, were ſhe, by a vigorous exertion, to reduce Howe as ſhe has reduced Burgoyne. Her currency would riſe to millions beyond its preſent value. Every man would be rich, and every man would have it in his power to be happy. And why not do theſe things? What is there to hinder? America is her own miſtreſs and can do what ſhe pleaſes.</p>
            <p>If we had not at this time a man in the field, we could, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, raiſe an army in a few weeks ſufficient to overwhelm all the force which General Howe at preſent commands. Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor and determination will do any thing and every thing. We began the war with this kind of ſpirit, why not end it with the ſame? Here, Gentlemen, is the enemy. Here is the army. The intereſt, the happineſs, of all America is centered in this half ruined ſpot. Come on and help us. Here are laurels, come and ſhare them. Here are Tories, come and help us to expel them. Here are Whigs that will make you welcome, and enemies that dread your coming.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="unknown:015951_0026_0F9B23B478D08E40"/>The worſt of all policy is that of doing things by halves. Penny-wiſe and pound fooliſh has been the ruin of thouſands. The preſent ſpring, if rightly improved, will free us from all our troubles, and ſave us the expence of millions. We have now only one army to cope with. No opportunity can be fairer; no proſpect more promiſing. I ſhall conclude this paper with a few outlines of a plan either for filling up the battalions with expedition, or for raiſing an additional force for any limited time, on any ſudden emergency.</p>
            <p>That in which every man is intereſted is every man's duty to ſupport. And any burthen which falls equally on all men, and, from which every man is to receive an equal benefit, is conſiſtent with the moſt perfect ideas of liberty. I would wiſh to revive ſomething of that virtuous animation which firſt called America into the field. Then every man was eager to do his part, and perhaps the principal reaſon why we have in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree fallen therefrom, is, becauſe we did not ſet a ſufficient value by it at firſt, but left it to blaze out of itſelf, inſtead of regulating and preſerving it by juſt proportions of reſt and ſervice.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe any State whoſe number of effective inhabitants were 80,000, ſhould be required to furniſh 3200 men towards the defence of the Continent on any very ſudden emergency.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Let the whole number of effective inhabitants be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into hundreds; then if each of thoſe hundreds turn out four men, the whole number of 3200 will be had.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, Let the names of each hundred men be entered in a book, and let four dollars be collected from each man, with as much more as any of the gentlemen whoſe abilities can afford it ſhall pleaſe to throw in, which gifts ſhall likewiſe be entered againſt the donors names.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, Let the ſums ſo collected be offered as a preſent, over and above the bounty of twenty dollars, to any four who may be inclined to propoſe themſelves as volunteers; if more than four offer, the majority of the ſubſcribers preſent ſhall deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine which; if none offers, then four out of the hundred ſhall be taken by lot, who ſhall be entitled to the ſaid ſums, and ſhall either go, or provide others that will, in the ſpace of ſix days.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly, As it will always happen, that in the ſpace of ground on which any hundred men ſhall live, there will always be a number of perſons who, by age and infirmity, are incapable of
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:015951_0027_0F9B23B5396F9D00"/>
doing perſonal ſervice, and as ſuch perſons are generally poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of the greateſt part of the property in any <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> their portion of ſervice, therefore will be to furniſh <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> with a blanket, which will make a regimental coat jacket and breeches, or cloaths in lien thereof, and another for a watch cloak and two pair of ſhoes—for however <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> people may be of theſe things matters not in caſes of this kind—Thoſe who live a ways in houſes can find many ways to keep them <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> warm, but it is a ſhame and a ſin to ſuffer a ſoldier in the field to want a blanket while there is one in the country.</p>
            <p>Should the cloathing not be wanted, the ſuperannuated or infirm perſons poſſeſſing property, may, in lieu thereof, throw in their money ſubſcriptions towards encreaſing the bounty, for though age will naturally exempt a perſon from perſonal ſervice, it cannot exempt him from his ſhare of the charge, becauſe the men are raiſed for the defence of property and liberty jointly.</p>
            <p>There never was a ſcheme againſt which objections might not be raiſed. But this alone is not a ſufficient reaſon for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. The only line to judge truly upon, is, to draw out and admit all the objections which can fairly be made, and place againſt them all the contrary qualities, conveniences and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, then by ſtriking a balance you come at the true cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of any ſcheme, principle or poſition.</p>
            <p>The moſt material advantages of the plan here <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> eaſe, expedition, and cheapne's; yet the men ſo raiſed <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> a much larger bounty than is any where at preſent given; becauſe all the expences, extravagance, and conſequent idleneſs of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruiting are ſaved or prevented. The country incurs up new debt, nor intereſt thereon; the whole matter being all ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled at <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and entirely done with. It is a ſubſcription anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the purpoſes of a tax, without either the charge or trouble of collecting. The men are ready for the field with the greateſt poſſible expoſition, becauſe it becomes the duty of the inhabitants themſelves, in every part of the country, to find up their proportion of men, inſtead of leaving it to a recruiting Serjeant, who, be he ever ſo induſtrious, cannot know always where to apply.</p>
            <p>I do not propoſe this as a regular digeſted plan, neither will the limits of this <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
