            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE general deſign is already known. But, as the pulpit is rather in dept to little Children, my particular deſign is to preach to them. I have often thought of taking this method, to impreſs their tender minds with the importance of early duty, in conſequence of ſeeing them ſo atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to inſtruction, when diſtinguiſhed by a particular addreſs: and, as often have been afraid of the attempt, left I ſhould not treat things according to their capacities, without being too free with the public rights of others. Their little opening minds are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of receiving ſome of the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant truths of the goſpel when they are eaſily connected, and plainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. And, though I cannot claim that tenderneſs, and inſtructive ſkill that are equal to the ſubject, yet I am
<pb facs="unknown:018195_0003_0FA5C02C020BE148"/>
induced to addreſs them in this public manner, becauſe I hope the divine bleſſing will ſucceed my intention, in anſwer to the unwearied prayers of chriſtians for their ſalvation. My hopes of ſome meaſure of ſucceſs, are alſo ſtrengthened from this conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that all faithful perſons who love to form the minds of little children for Chriſt, and give them to him with nurturing hands, will gratefully improve their advantages, in every department, to extend, and widen theſe inſtructions, and add a laſting influence to them, with line upon line, and precept upon precept, repeatedly, and continually.</p>
            <p>The method will contain two gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral branches: in the firſt place, I ſhall ſhew children, what it is to obey their parents in the Lord: and ſecondly in what reſpect, it is right or beautiful. And as the principal deſign, is to give inſtruction to little children, I take it for granted, the candid, improved mind will chuſe to hear them addreſſed, in their own plain, and familiar ſtyle: we ſhall therefore indulge freedom of thought, and ſimplicity of expreſſion.</p>
            <p>And now, my dear children, ſince the ſermon is to be preached to you, I aſk your diligent and careful attention
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:018195_0004_0FA5C02CCB881E30"/>

mind, like many others, older than you, who ought to ſet better examples. But, you muſt worſhip God in ſpirit, and in truth, and love his word with all the heart; and then Chriſt will love you, as the tender lambs of his flock.</p>
            <p>IN the firſt branch of diſcourſe, I am to ſhew you, what it is, to obey your parents in the Lord. And, to make it eaſy for you to underſtand. I will mention ſix things, which belong to the wicked claſs of children, that you muſt not indulge, if you intend to be dutiful.</p>
            <p>Firſt, To be dutiful children, you muſt not indulge a careleſs diſpoſition, reſpecting the directions of your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. For the careleſs temper is one cauſe of diſobedience. And, if you have a great deal of this temper, you will have the more diſobedience. Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs children treat the directions of their parents, as though not worthy of any notice. Even while in company with them, they often hear without at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention &amp; conſequently, without any more obedience to their directions, than to the blowing of the wind. And when they happen to be at a little diſtance, not only let them call a number of times, without giving an anſwer; at all
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:018195_0006_0FA5C02F01558998"/>
And what is this but diſobedience? What is it better than obedience to ſatan? For, he perſuades them not to anſwer, that he may learn them, not only to deceive, but to tell lies alſo. And hence it comes to paſs, when the parents have called with wearineſs, without receiving any anſwer from the child, and they enquire whether he did not hear, he has NO for an anſwer as quick as he can ſpeak. And when this is done, ſatan feels highly pleaſed, for he has not only learned him to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and deceitful, but to cover all over with a LYE. And this is ſatan's me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod with children<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he learns them one thing after another, till they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo acquainted with ſin, as to get by heart the moſt wicked leſſon he teaches. And, as ſoon as he prevails with children to be careleſs, he finds it eaſy to learn them to be forgetful, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and lye, and almoſt every thing he pleaſes in a ſhort time. You muſt not then indulge a careleſs diſpoſition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For the careleſs child is the undutiful one.</p>
            <p>Secondly, You muſt not indulge idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. For the idle ſpirit is unfriendly to obedience. The idle child cannot therefore be a dutiful one. And, idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:018195_0007_0FA5C02FD8BF6360"/>
is not only a bad thing in itſelf, but is the cauſe of a great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n any more. For when ſatan finds an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e child, he will ſoon have ſomething for him to do that is very wicked. He has a great deal of buſineſs, for id<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e children to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y are ſuch fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, wicked little creatures, that they a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ways love to do as he bid them, a thouſand times better than to obey their pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ents. There are many chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who obey ſatan ſteadily all day long, and hate with all their hearts to be obedient in the Lord. They love to eſcape the ſight of duty, and to keep at the greateſt diſtance from it: And, therefore, when a chi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d of this temper reads the bible, his catechiſm, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, his heart is ſtill in love with idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. He does not love to ſee the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if his parents keep it in a ſtrict, and holy manner, becauſe he takes no pleaſure in duty: But, if his parents diſregard the ſabbath, and make it a day of idleneſs, inſtead of holy reſting, then he loves to ſee it, for a play-day. He is very diligent at play, but has no diligence in duty. When, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is directed to do an errand, it ſeems as though idleneſs, and ſlothful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs together, would not let him move
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:018195_0008_0FA5C03078DF2C70"/>
a ſingle ſtep; but as ſoon as he ſees an opportunity to ſlide into play with diſobedient children, he is all life, and ſpirit, and goes as faſt as he can run. And, this is the child that is ſo unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as ſoon as he eſcapes the ſight of his parents. He not only neglects to do as he is directed, but ſtays a great while, though charged to return im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately; and frequently very much diſturbs the buſineſs of the family for ſome time. He acts as though he could not obey his parents too little, and ſatan too much. In ſhort, the idle creature is always in ſatan's path, and the devil cannot go a along without ſeeing him, or ſtumbling upon him. But, how fooliſh is it, for a child to go, &amp; wait for the devil to come along, to give him wicked thoughts, and tell him what to do next? How fooliſh, did I ſay? Rather, how very wicked? How diſhonorable to God, who hath made him to love, and obey his parents in the moſt dutiful manner? And how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to his own ſoul? and when children will indulge the idle diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp; throw themſelves in ſatan's way, they have nothing to expect, but God will give them up entirely, and let him lead them where he pleaſes, till he
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:018195_0009_0FA5C03142F85488"/>
leads them blind, right down to hell. Take care then, children, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw your feet from the path of idleneſs for it leads directly to deſtruction. I hope you will remember, that idleneſs was one of the great ſins of Sodom, for which ſo many people were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed with fire from heaven. And remember Lot's wife alſo, who became a pillar of ſalt, becauſe ſhe was ſo idle, as to look back, when God told her to make haſte, and eſcape for her life, leſt ſhe ſhould periſh with the reſt of the people. You muſt not then ſtand all the day idle, with the wicked, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake idleneſs, and love diligence, or you cannot be dutiful children. But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If you intend to obey your parents in the Lord, you muſt not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge the ſpirit of anger. For "Anger reſteth in the boſom of fools." And, fire, you not only reſemblethe the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry revengeful man, whoſe tongue and eyes are full of poiſon and ſpite, but the little malicious devils themſelves. You muſt therefore put away anger, and wrath, and every thing of that nature: for the dutiful child is as gentle, and meek as a lamb. He has the ſpirit of Chriſt, and does not love to be fretful, and peeviſh. And nothing alarms him

no humility in their hearts till they are made new creatures, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more common, than for them to obey their parents with his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. And this is the ſpirit, when they obey their parents only for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he ſake of being thought better than others. Their hearts are ſo proud, and vain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as to be delighted with empty praiſe. And they will often attend to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of their parents, for the ſake of gratifying the pride and vanity of their hearts, when nothing elſe is ſufficient to move them. But, this is poor obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence indeed, becauſe it is performed in pride, inſtead of humility:—And, little children will never appear beautiful, in the ſight of God, whoſe eye is fixed on the heart, till they are as humble as the duſt. As they are taken from the duſt, they can only pleaſe God, when they feel humble, and little, and love to do their duty for the ſake of the holy pleaſure they enjoy in it. And when this humble temper prevails, like little diligent bees, which fly from one low flower to another, to collect the richeſt honey, wherever they can find it, ſo humble little chidren will love to go from thing to thing, where they can ſerve God the moſt, and enjoy him

the beſt. Vain worthleſs praiſe is very lightly eſteemed; and the lovely exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the little Jeſus will be their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light:—When Chriſt was a child, he loved to obey his parents, not for the ſake of idle praiſe, but becauſe he loved his duty.—Duty was his delight— and therefore he conducted in ſuch a lovely inoffenſive manner, with ſo much wiſdom, and propriety, that as he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in ſtature, or grew up, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in favour with God, and man. He was loved by all, who loved the beauties of holineſs, and received the moſt laſting praiſes of the dutiful ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Here is an example for little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that will never fade away, but grow brighter and brighter: And you muſt forſake pride, and follow this example, if you intend to be dutiful children, and worthy of true praiſe, But,</p>
            <p>Fifthly, If you intend to be dutiful children, you muſt not indulge ſelfiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſs. For after all the ſoft, and pretty names which ſatan hath given it to deceive the world, it is the ſubſtance of all iniquity. And as the ſelfiſh man, who appears to be a chriſtian, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he intends to be happy forever, cannot be one, ſo the child who obeys
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:018195_0013_0FA5C03505ABBC88"/>
his parents, only to obtain rich clothes and fine things, cannot be dutiful. For, when a child is governed by this ſpirit, it is not his parents he loves, but the fine things he intends to obtain from them. And, hence this kind of obedience never laſts longer than the proſpect of private rewards. It always looks for pay, juſt like the obedience of the Jews. When Chriſt came into the world, and manifeſted his almighty power,—in ſo many miracles,—they were very agreeably ſtruck with him indeed:—For a little time, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to love him exceedingly, and were ſo fond of obeying, that they intended to have made him King. But what may we ſuppoſe, was the cauſe of ſo much love and reſpect? Were they in love with his true character, or ſomething elſe?—I will tell you, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, if you will attend:—They were in love with themſelves only, in the gratification of their unlawful deſires. They were in love with ſin, and lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chriſt only as the kingly ſervant of their pleaſures:—They loved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the moſt, and Chriſt only to defend them from their enemies, and increaſe their worldly grandeur. And if he had done according to their ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:018195_0014_0FA5C035D4A2C2B8"/>
deſires, they would have loved him extremely, no doubt. But this was impoſſible, becauſe he came to deſtroy the kingdom of ſatan, inſtead of buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it up —Therefore, as ſoon as he reproved them for their ſelfiſhneſs, and told them to give away their riches to the poor, and take up the croſs, and follow him in a holy manner, they were highly offended:—And not only ſo, but told the baſeſt lies about him they could invent. —and did every thing poſſible to r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>in his character; and make every body hate him:— But this was not all, for when he, in the moſt friendly loving manner, warned them of the danger of their ſelfiſhneſs, it ſo fired their hearts with hatred, and malice, that they put him to death without pity or tears. They ſhed the blood of God (for Chriſt was God) only becauſe he would not indulge them in ſin. O, ungreatful man! What haſt thou done! For Chriſt came into the world to ſave thee from hell, and give thee heaven, and when dying on the croſs, prayed for thy ſalvation! And what have you done, my children, or rather, what are you doing ſtill, who do not love Chriſt with all your hearts? But, let us not loſe ſight of the Jews.
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:018195_0015_0FA5C036F0CE9930"/>
What was all that love and obedience good for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which they ſhewed Chriſt, when they intended to have put a crown upon his head, and treated him as King? It was good for nothing, becauſe ſelfiſh:—And ſo all ſelfiſh obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience will change itſelf inſtantly into the moſt bitter ſpite and malice, when denied the thing it luſts after. This is the natural picture of ſelfiſh religion, And, I have given you this inſtance, to ſhew that all the ſelfiſh obedience of children to their parents, is of no value in the ſight of God. There are many children, who appear to lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is ſelfiſhneſs that makes children deſire, and aſk for things not proper for them to have; and reſentful when denied: It makes you uneaſy with the things you have, and fretful that you have not more: It is this that makes ſo much uneaſineſs with the conduct of parents, which is fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with ſo much diſobedience: It makes you ſo covetous, and loth to give, as your parents direct you, to poor little children, who have nothing but poverty, and rags:—It is ſelfiſhneſs that prevents your doing as you would be done by. In ſhort, it is the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of diſobedience, and as far as you are ſelfiſh, you cannot be dutiful chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.

more afraid of correction, than of faults is to love one's ſelf more than the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and honour of God, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be right. But there is a great deal of obedience, ſuch as it is, that is wholly indebted to the fear of correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and nothing elſe: And, hence the undutiful child, will often do as he is directed, when at the ſame time, if not afraid of correction, would pay no ſort of attention to the matter. But the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful child is as much afraid of faults as of correction: And more too, I believe we may ſay, as far as the dutiful diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition prevails: For he loves God with all his heart. And no reaſon can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven why a perſon, where things are wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly regulated, ſhould be afraid of unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved puniſhment, for God does not allow the offender to be puniſhed more than he deſerves: —And when parents, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

heart: For they were ſhapen in ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and conceived in ſin. Their hearts are full of nothing but enmity to God. As a young ſerpent has the nature of old one, ſo the little infant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> has the nature of a wicked man in his heart. And the hearts of old me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>AND, now I will mention ſix things that belong to the new heart, and you muſt have them all, or you will not obey your parents in the Lord.</p>
            <p>Firſt, You muſt love all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, For if you are not pleaſed with the entenſive nature of God's law, you will not love the fifth command, which is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> "Honour thy father and mother."—The fifth commandment and the text, contain one and the ſame thing. And certainly you muſt love this, or you will not be dutiful. But if you love the fifth, you will all the reſt; for they hang together, and make but one thing, which is love.— Therefore the ſcripture ſays,
<q>Love is the fulfilling o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But, to
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:018195_0024_0FA5C03F8FB97B70"/>
make it eaſy for you to ſee the neceſſity of loving the commandments to be du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, let me aſk: How can you be truly obedient, when directed by your parents, not to take God's holy name in vain, and not to uſe any wicked words, if you do not love the third commandment? You remember it is this—"Thou ſhalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain"—And, how can you be obedient in the Lord i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> you do not love the Lord's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments? While I am ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this commandment, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be amiſs to tell you, that the breach of it, is not only a great vice, but a growing one. How often do you hear men ſwear and curſe and damn each other to hell as though they juſt came up with their tongues red hot from the fire of damnation! And, how often do you hear little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren who juſt begin to run about ſtreet, ſpeak the language of hell plainer than any other? I doubt, my children, that you hear more of the language of hell than you do of heaven. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is this, people do not love the third commandment. See to it then, that you do not act like others, but love it. But, to paſs on: How can
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:018195_0025_0FA5C04077571958"/>
you be dutiful children in the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of the ſabbath, when you are told by your parents to be good chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, not to play, but attend to all the duties of it both at home and at meeting, if you do not love the fourth commandment? But as ſoon as you love the commandment, you will love to read the bible, and all other good books; the ſabbath will be your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and all the branches of duty which belong to it will be your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. For the proper direction of your parents is the commanding voice of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that points out your duty. It is juſt as though you heard him ſpeak to you, as plainly as you hear it thunder. For, he inſtructs them that they may inſtruct you.—And they are inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble if you are not inſtructed properly. Now then as the voice of parents, is the voice of God, you eaſily ſee you muſt love the commandments of God, or you will not obey your parents in the Lord. Inſtead of following the example of thoſe wicked children who ſaw Chriſt when on earth and heard him ſpeak, and yet were not obedient, you muſt obey him now, in loving all the directions of your parent. Nor, muſt you, by any means, treat aged
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:018195_0026_0FA5C04100D75118"/>
people, however poor, after the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of thoſe children who mocked Gods prophet as he went along; ſaying, "Go up thou bald head, go up thou bald head." For they were curſed in the name of the Lord, and torn to pieces by wild beaſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the breach of the fifth commandment. They did not love the commandment, and therefore did not chuſe to honour old age and reverence the good man by bowing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently before him. Here you have a glaring inſtance of the undutiful temper, and of God's diſpleaſure in conſequence of it. And both were written for your inſtruction. And would you be dutiful in the ſight of God, when your parents direct you in the moſt careful manner never to take the things of orhers with diſhoneſt hearts, you muſt love the eight commandment: This will make you honeſt worthy children. And then inſtead of taking the leaſt thing from your fellows, or carrying litte pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>

               </gap>ſted with all the treaſures of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. And not only ſo, but God would count you faithful, and "Commit to your truſt the true riches." And, would
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:018195_0027_0FA5C041CAEFDDA0"/>
you always maintain a ſacred regard to truth, in little things, as well as great ones<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you muſt have the ninth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand by heart, with love and delight. For the love of this command is the love of truth. And then inſtead of thoſe deceitful faces, thoſe falſe, and lying tongues, and that double dealing which looks one way and means ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which belong to the devil's chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, you will be the children of truth who will not lye nor deceive:—For, your words and actions will always ſhew the meaning of your hearts.— When we hear you ſpeak, we ſhall ſee your hearts: And when we ſee you act, we ſhall know your intentions.—Such a character as this is lovely indeed. It will bear the light. For it was Chriſt's character when a child, and worthy of the beſt imitation. And to be dutiful children it muſt be your's. For the deceitful, lying temper, and the dutiful temper do not agree any better than darkneſs and light. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, If you intend to be du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful children, you muſt love repentance for all your paſt diſobedience. It is probable you rather think, ſome of you, that you have not been diſobedient. But, if you have not new hearts you
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:018195_0028_0FA5C0428A8CE5B0"/>
have been very diſobedient in the ſight of God, however you have appeared to others: — You have violated the fifth commandment a great many times. — And, without the moſt heaaty repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, you are ſtill going on in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient path. A Child who is dutiful at preſent, is alſo penitent for all paſt diſobedience. And if you deſire to know what repentance is, or what you muſt do to repent, I will tell you as plainly as I can. It is to ſhun ſin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of indulging it in your hearts:— Thus when parents direct dutiful chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren not to keep company with the wicked<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they are very careful to eſcape their company, and avoid it by every method that is lawful. They are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to truſt their hearts in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the wicked, leſt they ſhould be tempted to evil. But, penitent obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient children love the company of each other for the ſake of that ſweet fellowſhip and agreement, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways take place between them. As birds of a feather flock together, ſo good children <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e to meet, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe about God, and Chriſt and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal things. And you may always know a good child by his company; and a wicked child two. For one
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:018195_0029_0FA5C04421AEB610"/>
makes choice of good company, and the other of bad. And, as ſoon as it is evident that a child loves the company of wicked children, there is great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of his ruin. And it is high time for his parents to take the beſt care of him they are able, leſt his deſtruction ſhould be charged to their neglect. I could give you the hiſtory of a little boy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if I had opportunity, who choſe the company of wicked children and was bent upon keeping ſuch company, contrary to the directions and moſt poſitive commands of his kind parents. And the longer he kept bad company, the more diſobedient he grew: For God gave him up to be diſobedient. At length he was too hardened to liſten to his mother, or regard his father. He came to the years of diſcretion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any diſcretion, and not a better man than child. For he was ſo baſe and ungrateful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as to mock his weeping mother when ſhe expreſſed her tears and concern reſpecting him: and not only ſo, but in a ſhort time was ſuch a daring monſter, as not only to threaten, but ſtrike his father in the face if he offered to reprove him. The kind aged father was grieved and cut to the heat to ſee his undutiful ſon, but was
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:018195_0030_0FA5C044C24204A8"/>
obliged to let him alone; for it was dangerous to ſpeak to him, he had ſuch a ſpiteful malicious temper. And what may we ſuppoſe has become of ſuch a creature? But there are more ſad examples of this nature than one. And it is not ſtrange, for there are a great many diſobedient children. And, if God ſhould leave all diſobedient chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to conduct in this manner, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy themſelves quickly, as he juſtly might, the world wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d ſoon be full of ſuch painful ſights. And let me tell you therefore, if you ſee the danger of early diſobedience, you are under grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter obligation to repent of it immeadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately. And I hope you will remember, that to repent of diſobedience, you muſt become obedient; and to repent of chuſing bad company, you muſt leave it and chuſe good company. So you muſt repent of all wicked courſes by forſaking them, and chuſing thoſe that are good. And then you will have that repentance which is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant companion of the dutiful temper. But, Thirdly, If you intend to be du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful chidren, you muſt love to be ſorry for your diſobedience. And if you only attend a moment, you will ſee the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of it. For you have been
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:018195_0031_0FA5C045E7E83F60"/>
great ſinners already, though you are little<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not only, in breaking the fifth commandment, but in many other things. You are apt to think, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> your ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s are very ſmall. But this is not true:— For your ſins are all committed againſt the great God. If God were little then your ſins would be little, but as God is great, and his commandments are great, and exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oad, all your ſins are great, every one of them. There is no ſuch thing as a little ſin: —Some ſins, it is true, are greater than others, but every ſin deſerves God's wrath and curſe both in this life, and that which is to come. Your ſins are great, like mountains upon mountains, not only higher than the clouds, and ſtars, but infinitely high. And they are more in number than the hairs of your heads. The angels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, whoſe knowledge is ſo extenſive, are not able to ſee the greatneſs of one little child's ſin, becauſe it is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt the infinitely great Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah. How ſorry then ſhould you be for ſin? It is impoſſible for your hearts to be too full of the deepeſt ſorrow. And, when God gives you dutiful hearts, you will feel ſorry, that you will hardly know what to do with yourſelves:—
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:018195_0032_0FA5C0482E6FAA30"/>
Sin will be your greateſt burden: —Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row will lye down with you. and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent your ſleep for hours together:—It will riſe with you, and feel like a heavy preſſing weight on your hearts. So I ſuppoſe the good child's heart is ſorry for ſin, all night, while he is aſleep. Godly ſorry cannot be ſlept away: — For it lives in the heart day and night, conſtantly. The good child is grieved, and out to the heart, that his kind pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents have been ſo much diſhonored by his paſt diſobedience. He cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give himſelf, that he hath been ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, idle, &amp; obſtinate; ſo pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, &amp; ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh; and ſo much in love with diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, as not to be afraid of any thing, but correction in conſequence of it.—And more than this, he won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſome times, that God can ſpare him a ſingle moment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and does not cut the thread of life, and let the weight of his ſins carry him down inſtantly to hell. He not only ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, but FEELS it to be entirely juſt for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God to puniſh him and all offenders, as their ſins de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve. Thus he lies low in the duſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a juſt and holy God, who is infinite<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y offended with him for ſin.—He looks up and admires the patience of God that prevents his fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:018195_0033_0FA5C048A71BE2F8"/>
he looks down, and plainly ſees what he deſerves, and does not feel rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to complain, if God's patience ſhould come to an end, and let him fall into the hands of ſtrict juſtice, and r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ap the wages of ſin. And when he feels in this manner, it is his choice to be wholly at the diſpoſal of an infinitely juſt, and merciful God, who can do no wrong. He is not afraid to truſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf entirely in the hand of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he knows what he will do with him. As he deſerves no good, he feels that God would not treat him unjuſtly to give him none, and that infinite mercy only can prevent all poſſible evils. Thus, my children, let me tell you and I hope you will remember it, all perſons feel who have new hearts, while they are thinking in a particular manner of God's juſtice, and their own ſinfulneſs. And I hope you will all know, what it is to have theſe feelings of heart. For you cannot be dutiful children, and chriſtians without. But let us h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſten to the next thing, for the connection between true ſorrow and joy is quicker than we can ſpeak.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, If you intend to be duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful children, you muſt love Chriſt with all the heart. For, God not only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:018195_0034_0FA5C0494659AFC8"/>
you to repent of ſin, and to be heartily humble, and ſorry for it, but to look, and fly to Chriſt immediately for ſalvation, in the moſt joyful ſenſe. It would be wrong for men to continue ſinners, if no ſalvation were provided for them at all. For, ſin is an unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thing. No one can juſtify Ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m for attempting to hide from God, and remaining his enemy a ſingle moment after he fell, though he ſaw <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion offered, and nothing but deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before him. For you can eaſily tell, if aſked, what elſe he ſhould have done. Nor can we juſtify the wicked ſpirits in hell for h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ing God any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, though he has no mercy for them. For it is wrong to ſin againſt a holy God, on earth, in hell, or any where e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e. Therefore, as Chriſt is moſt freely offered, to ſave you, not only from ſin, but from puniſhment too you cannot fly to him too ſoon, and with too much eagerneſs of heart for ſalvation. I don't mean to direct you to love Chriſt only to be ſaved from hell; for an undutiful child can do this, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main an enemy to Chriſt, when he has done —But you muſt love him to be ſaved from ſin with a holy believing love. And when you have that true
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:018195_0035_0FA5C04A06DC60D0"/>
ſorrow for ſin which I have juſt deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, you will hate ſin, and be more afraid of it than you are of hell, and will feel it to be an infinite privilege, to come to Chriſt to be ſaved from it. And, as Chriſt hath ſuffered the curſe, in his own body on the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oſs, that thoſe who believe and love him may be honorably ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>om it, your hearts ſhould feel warm with true thankfulneſs, that there is an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to eſcape the wrath and curſe of God.—As you have no righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of your own, you are under all poſſible obligations to accept of Chriſt, who is "The Lord ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> righteouſneſs." And ſince we are all nakedly expoſed to God's wrath, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Fifthly, If you intend to be duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful children, you muſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ove prayer. Prayer is humbly to aſk God, in the
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:018195_0036_0FA5C04AD3505218"/>
name of Chriſt, for all thoſe things which are proper for him to give. And good children love to pray. They love to offer up their deſires to God, for things agreeable to his will, in the name of Chriſt, with confeſſion of their ſins, and thankful acknowledgment of his mercy. They not only ſay their prayers, like little parrots, but pray with their hearts. They are peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and humble, and love the things they aſk for. When they aſk for mercy, they love mercy. They love and reverence the holy name of Chriſt, in which they pray. And, it is a great grief to them, that they have no more repentance, and humility in their prayers. They tremble at the thought of aſking amiſs. And thus they often pray God earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to teach them to pray, that they may come before him in a holy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable manner, without taking his name in vain. And you muſt pray in this holy manner, or God will not hear you. God will not hear the prayer of any one who regards iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in his heart. You muſt then make good prayers. There is no ſuch thing as a prayer, that is neither good, nor bad. For the conduct of reaſon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ble creatures is not indifferent;—And a
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:018195_0037_0FA5C04B8ADE5170"/>
bad prayer you muſt not make; You muſt make ſuch prayers as God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and that he will accep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of for Chriſt's ſake when made, and that will be acceptable at the great day:—And not thoſe, which he calls nothing, and are forbidden. They muſt all then be made in the name—in the love—and for the ſake of Chriſt: And then God will love you. And, if you can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs yourſelves without having a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by heart, you ſhould go alone into the cloſet, or ſome other ſecret place, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>here none can ſee or hear you but God, and after kneeling humbly before him, confeſs your ſins, and aſk for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the name of Chriſt. Pray for all you need: Pray for your parents, your brothers, and ſiſters, and every body. Pray that God would manifeſt his love abundantly in the ſalvation of ſinners, and that the whole world might be full of good people—And, if you can ſay nothing but the Lord's prayer, and the little ones in the primmer, go with love to Chriſt in your hearts, and ſay theſe. For God loves the little children of Chriſt, it gives him pleaſure to ſee them running to him with open hearts for what they need. For his fulneſs is infinite, and he delights to ſupply them.

You cannot tire God with holy prayer. And he will hear you pray at any time, and in any place whatever. As God is every where, you may pray any where. But as he loves order and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity: As the ſun riſes and ſets ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ſtrict order, you muſt be as ſteady and regular as time in du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt pray before you go to bed, and when you get up. Never let the day begin, or end, without improving the beſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to get down upon your little humble knees before God, in prayer. Morning and evening mercies, and wants, call for morning and evening thankſgiving &amp; prayer. And, no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but the ſinner, can be deaf to the call. But, ſuch deafneſs we muſt poſſeſs. For we ſhall ſoon end a ſhorr life in death, and leave time for eternity. As it is therefore not ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And how a good child can live without daily humble prayer, I believe nobody will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to tell, but the one who does not pray himſelf.

For, as the natural appetite of children will lead them to aſk their parents, for common food; ſo the holy appetite, and deſires of good children, will lead them to aſk their heavenly father every day for the bread of life. Hence, my children, when you feel appetites for natural food, night, and morning, it ſhou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d make you think of your needy ſouls, which will periſh without the bread of life. And the only way to get the bread of life is to aſk for it.—For he that aſketh receiveth. You will remember this in the mean time, that you muſt aſk in faith, and not aſk amiſs. Therefore God ſays, "Let not that man think that he ſhall receive any thing of the Lord." If you do not love Chriſt God will not love your prayers. But, I ſuppoſe ſome of you are ready to make the common, and idle excuſe, that you have no time to pray. But let me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you not to make this excuſe any more, unleſs you have no time to die, whether prepared or unprepared, I lately read the account of a little boy eleven years old, who often continued
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:018195_0040_0FA5C04DB6E519C0"/>
on his k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ees in prayer to God, half an hour, and an hour at a time. He tried to keep it a ſecret, that he went away, and prayed ſo much. But the family ſoon knew it, and a perſon one day having a mind to know what this ſweet child prayed for, went and liſtened;
<q>and heard him very earneſtly Pray for the church of God, and deſire that the goſpel might be ſpread over the whole world, that the people of God might be more and more holy, and that the kingdom of glory might be haſtened.</q>
This child found time to pray becauſe he loved it. It was his delight. And if prayer was your delight, you would find time alſo. For, God hath moſt certainly given us as much time as duty —He hath not commanded us to do any thing, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out allowing ſufficient time for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance. But, if you ſtill think you have not time to pray, let me aſk you a little ſhort queſtion; Have you time to play? The queſtion is anſwered.— And, what if you ſhould only ſpend half of the time in ſweet humble prayer to God that you ſpend, every day at play, what different children would you be? You would be little ſhining chriſtians, almoſt too good to live out of heaven any longer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="unknown:018195_0041_0FA5C04FEB924048"/>BUT ſince you may be called away by ſome perſon to attend to buſineſs before you have prayed in ſecret, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the knowledge of your parents and maſters, who have given you time for ſecret duties you ſhould take the firſt opportunity and go again, and if inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted ſtill, go the third time; and not only ſo, but the ſeventh time. Weary not in well doing, for i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> due ſeaſon ye ſhall reap, if ye faint not. And after proper attention, if you have time only to make the ſhorteſt prayer, whether in the houſe, or by the way if you make it with a good heart, God will hear you. There was a man, we read of, who only made this ſhort prayer,— "God me merciful to me a ſinner,"— and God heard, and anſwered him.— And if you only make ſuch a little Prayer as this, with a humble heart, God will hear and anſwer you as he did that penitent man.</p>
            <p>But let me tell you one thing: Don't pleaſe ſatan ſo much, as to ſtay alone, after you have done prayer, only to make people believe you love to pray. For this is deceitful, and nothing but hypocriſy. You may, if you have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="43" facs="unknown:018195_0042_0FA5C0501C2B3650"/>
and aſk yourſelf whether you have prayed with the heart? For examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a duty of the cloſet, as well as prayer. I ſpeak to you particularly on prayer, becauſe it is the firſt born of chriſtian duties. And the dutiful child not only loves it, but has a great many things to pray for. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God, and conſequently the directions of parents are many. And he loves to go to God for ſtrength to obey. And dutiful children can no more live without prayer, than they can without victuals and drink. As the children of Iſrael uſed to gather manna every day to feed their bodies; ſo the little children of Chriſt, who chuſe to keep themſelves from idols and vanities, love to gather heavenly manna every day to feed their ſouls. They cannot live on paſt food.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, if you intend to obey your parents in the Lord, you muſt do all theſe things that I have mentioned, and many more of the ſame nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, only to pleaſe the Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There is not a moment for the undutiful temper. And, as God made you, and your parents for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, you muſt love and honor them to pleaſe and reverence him, <q>Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, obey your parents in the Lord.</q> And, as the ſun riſes and ſhines, and never tires, nor reſts, ſo you muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, and continue to be dutiful</p>

It is pleaſant to ſee an elegant garden full of fruitful trees, uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful plants, and delightful flowers: So it is pleaſant to ſee jewels and dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds gliſten before the ſun; but, all theſe thin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s are not half ſo beautiful as little children, who obey their pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ents in the Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d. It is like apples of gold in pictures of ſilver, to ſee dutiful little children. It is one of the beauties of holin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſs. And, what I cannot do by words in ſetting forth this beauty, I hope you will do in actions. For du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:018195_0045_0FA5C05235D2A020"/>
conduct can ſpeak the beſt for it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. But in what this beauty conſiſts, I will attempt to ſhew in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, it is right for children to obey their parents in the Lord, becauſe they are ſo much indebted to them. God has made children greatly in debt to their parents indeed. Children are brought into the world by their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; and are little parts of their bodies, as limbs and branches are lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle parts of the tree.</p>
            <p>They are therefore in debt to them for their very beings. And not only ſo, but in debt for all the early f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>vours of life. God firſt gives good things to parents, and then diſpoſes them to imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rt to their children: And things are ſo wiſely ordered, that parents can no more forget their children than themſelves. They ſeem to love them as tenderly as themſelves. And, as little infants, and children, are ſo feeb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e and helpleſs, that they cannot take care of themſelves, what a great favour is it, that God hath given diſpoſitions to parents, to take care of them as they need. Little infants are ſome of the moſt helpleſs creatures in the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ld. Some little creatures can take
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:018195_0046_0FA5C0530D7F17E8"/>
care of themſelves very early. But, if parents do not take the greateſt care of their children when they firſt come into the world, they ſoon go out of it again.—</p>
            <p>The tender mother, who loves to hold the little babe in her arms, and feed, and nouriſh it, is made uſe of in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, to ſave its life.—And no one, I ſuppoſe, but tender parents themſelves, has any juſt views of the care and concern that are due to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, not only when infants, but for a number of years together, before they are fit to act for themſelves. And as children require a great deal of atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is eaſy to ſee, how much they would ſuffer, and how ſoon they would periſh, if neglected. What would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of you, if father and mother were taken away, and God ſhould not leave any kind perſon to take care of your little bodies and minds? You would ſoon become little ragged, naked crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And not only ſo; but very ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant too, and greatly expoſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to deſtruction. You therefore ſee, as you receive ſo many favours f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>om your parents that you are under great obligations to obey them. And, when you only remember, that all theſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:018195_0047_0FA5C053DF3C8560"/>
come to you from God, only through the hands of your parents, it is altogether right to obey them in the Lord. O, how good is God to little children, to open his bountiful hand ſo often to them, in the kindneſs they receive from their parents! And how grateful and dutiful ſhould they be when they think of it? And how often ſhould they think of it? Therefore, when dutiful brothers, and ſiſters think of the conſtant love and attention of parents, inſtead of being afraid, like undutiful children, that they ſhall do too much for them, they never think they can do enough. And they often have little virtuous contentions among themſelves, who ſhall do the moſt, and be the beſt child. And how charming is ſuch a ſight? But, above all things when they remember the goodneſs of God, in ſending Chriſt into the world with his grace, and giving pare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ts to train them up for him; how obedient will they be to their parents for Chriſt's ſake? They will love Chriſt becauſe they are baptized in his holy name, and honor their parents for his ſake, becauſe he hath diſpoſed their hearts to devote them ſo early to God. They love to find themſelves the children of
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:018195_0048_0FA5C05482384490"/>
chriſtian parents, and members of Chriſt's baptized and ſealed family. And like young Joſian, and little Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy, they early drink in the truths of ſcripture, and become wiſe unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. In ſhort, theſe children feel ſo full of gratitude to God for their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and favour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> they receive from them, that they don't know how to expreſs it faſt enough, even in dutiful obedience. And we need only aſk the queſtion:—How beautiful is it for the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> thus to conduct? But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is right for children to obey their parents in the Lord, that they may be ready to aſſiſt them as they grow old and helpleſs. As the wiſdom of providence hath made little children dependent on parents; ſo the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>me providence hath made aged help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs parents dependent on their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. And, they are as much obliged to aſſiſt their aged parent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in a help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſtate, as their parents were to aſſiſt them in their infancy. And, the only way to be properly prepared, to take a ſuitable care of aged parents, when they need as much waiting upon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as infants, is for children to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come dutiful. If you now love your parents in a dutiful manner, you will be pleaſed with an opportunity of wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:018195_0049_0FA5C0553ACB9ED8"/>
upon them when they cannot help themſelves.—For dutiful children always make kind and tender hearted men, eſpecially to helpleſs parents. And, as aged people loſe thoſe pretty engaging actions that belong to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and become a burden to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and often to others, you will need very dutiful hearts to diſpoſe you to wait upon them as God requires. And if you have not dutiful hearts, you will probably neglect them a great many times, when they will ſtand in great need of your beſt kindneſſes. But, if you have dutiful diſpoſitions, you will always embrace an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to comfort and help them, with the greateſt pleaſure.—You will love to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>end them when ſick, and to ſupply them if poor: and when old age makes them children in underſtanding, and mere infants in ſtrength, you will be as kind to them as though they were your own children. And this is beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, for the kindneſs of children to old people is one of their beſt comforts: Whereas the leaſt neglect grieves and wounds their hearts.—You may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber this, that the dutiful ſon treats his aged helpleſs parents, as he would wiſh to be treated if one himſelf. He loves the golden rule, and conducts accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:018195_0050_0FA5C0560057AD50"/>
which makes his conduct ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſo beautiful toward his childiſh parents. And if you intend to make this your rule, and wiſh to have things meaſured out to you in old age by it, you ſhould now take hold of it with your hearts, and be dutiful little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Thridly, It is right for chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to obey their parents in the Lord, that they may be the richeſt bleſſings to each other. As brothers, and ſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are as near alike as nature can make them, like ſo many branches of the ſame tree, they ſhould reſemble each other in love. Yes, little brothers and ſiſters, whoſe features and actions have ſuch a reſemblance, as to be the very images of their fathers, and pictures of their mothers, ſhould all be alike in love and friendſhip. All their little hearts ſhould make but one. And then they would be brothers and ſiſters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and the lovelieſt little creatures in the world. Therefore the ſcripture ſays,
<q>Behold how good, and how pleaſant it is, for brethren to dwell together in unity.</q>
It is like holy oil, and the moſt refreſhing dews. It is not only a little picture of the family of Chriſt on earth, but of heaven itſelf, that is full of love and unity. And the only way for children to live together
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:018195_0051_0FA5C0581CACED58"/>
in this ſweet and lovely manner is to be dutiful to their parents. For, if they are deſtitute of dutiful love, they will be of brotherly love alſo. The lattex cannot exiſt without the former. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dutiful children have ſuch unfriendly hearts that they have no holy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in aſſiſting one another, when there is an opportunity. But, rather chuſe to vex and croſs each other. And, hence it comes to paſs, that the peace of the family is often diſturbed with their contentions and quarrels. And it is often in vain for parents to attempt to make peace and friendſhip between them, when they are little, for they do not love their parents will enough to liſten to their counſel and directions. And, when they grow up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> inſtead of living together in love and friendſhip, they live in envy and malice hateful and ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing one another. Theſe are the contentious children who have ſo much difficulty in ſettleing the eſtate that is left by their parents. It is frequently the caſe, as ſoon as the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is dead, and buried, and hardly cold in the grave, that the conſuming fire of brotherly contention is blown up about their portions. One wants the moſt of the eſtate, and the other moſt, and a third at heart wants it all,
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:018195_0052_0FA5C05848F601A0"/>
though aſhamed to mention it. And thus the fire ſoon becomes too great for them to manage. And, if kind neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours cannot quench it, and ſettle matters betwen them, the law muſt take it in hand, and end the ſtrife.—But after all they hate each other, as long as they live: and often die with hatred in their hearts, and go to hell. You then ſee that you cannot be loving bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and ſiſters when little, and imu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual bleſſings afterwards, without the dutiful temper. But, if you become dutiful when little, you will live toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in peace and harmony like friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly birds and doves, without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. And ſurely if birds can live together in the ſame neſt without ſtrife little borthers and ſiſters, ſhould fill the houſe with nothing but love.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, It is right that you ſhould obey your parents in the Lord, that you may be bleſſings to all men. Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are not only under obligations to be bleſſings to their parents, to each other, and the families where they live but to be bleſſings to every body. But without the dutiful ſpirit, you will not. For inſtance, when the undutiful child gets into the company of others, inſtead of learning them to be dutiful from his example, he will learn them the contrary, as far as his influence
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:018195_0053_0FA5C05905B3D6C0"/>
reaches. As one ſinner deſtroys much good, ſo one bad child often ſpoils a whole family of children; and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently all the children of his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance —
<q>Evil communication cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts good manners.</q>
Hence if you would be a bleſſing to other children, you muſt ſet them good examples, and not bad ones.</p>
            <p>BUT let us, my children, look a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle forward:—What will ſoon become of the world, if children all make their appearance in public life with unduti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful tempers? For, as the fruits of the earth drop off every fall, and leave their litle ſeeds to come up in the ſpring, to produce more; ſo old people drop away very faſt; and, if children, like little tender plants, and blades, do not riſe up with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> dutiful diſpoſitions, to fill their vacant places, there is reaſon to fear, the world will ſoon be very ripe for deſtruction. For, we have nothing to expect of undutiful children, as faſt as they arrive at manhood, but the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="55" facs="unknown:018195_0054_0FA5C05A8ACB7168"/>
before ſwearing, curſing, and gaming, are the moſt pleaſant practices. The open violation of God's holy law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes their amuſement and common diverſion. And not only ſo, but a few years in the devil's ſchool, will learn a youth to laugh at hell, ſport with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, deny the bible, deſy death, and murder himſelf, and others, to be happy. O take care!</p>
            <p>But, on the other hand, what can be more promiſing and beautiful, than to ſee children riſing up with the dutiful temper? For preſently, like little tender buds and bloſſoms in the ſpring, they will yield the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt fruits. They will be the joy and crown of their parents, the hope of families, and the firmeſt pillars of the church and ſtate. I am willing, my little hearers, you ſhould know that you are very capable members of ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The uſefulneſs of aged people is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt paſt: But little more can be expected from them. Our expectations are placed on the riſing generation. And, we hope that ſome of you at leaſt will be the fineſt men and women in the world. Nor do we hope in vain, if you now become little chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians. For, if God ſhould ſpare your lives, and lead you into public life, you will be the jewels and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:018195_0055_0FA5C05B62C663B8"/>
of the age. And if all little children were to follow the lovely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, the temple of God would be as wide as the world, and time itſelf would almoſt ſtand ſtill, to hear them ſing the ſweat hoſanna,
<q>Beſſed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.</q>
And let us thank God with all our hearts, that the time is coming, when all the little children on earth will be holy. For the world will be bleſſed indeed. It will be heaven upon earth. In the mean time therefore let us be holy, and pray God to haſten on that glorious day. For he hath promiſed that Chriſt ſhall ſee the fruits of his love. And when providence is ready, it will ſhine. But,</p>
            <p>Fifthly, I have one thing more to mention, and I ſhall cloſe: It is right for little children to obey their parents in the Lord, that they may be ready for an early death. You ſhould be entirely willing to die, as ſoon as God pleaſes. Nor can you be ready too ſoon. You have often heard your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents ſay, the young may die ſoon; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="57" facs="unknown:018195_0056_0FA5C05C015FC6B0"/>
for time to come till we find it gone and out of ſight. It is but a little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from the cradle to the grave. A hand's breadth only. As ſoon as we begin to live, we begin to die. Short is the ſpace between the weeping in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, and the dying old man. But ſhorter ſtill between the birth and death of the ſame child. And no age eſcapes death. It mows down old and young. The great and ſilent congregation of the dead is made up of all ages, and ſizes of mankind; and if you think of it when w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſome of your little brothers, and ſiſters, died before your preſent age, and by this time are mouldered away to duſt. And you ſhould remember, tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſuddenly take you away while little. As I hinted at firſt, you may not live to ſee another ſabbath, nor another day. Death and health are not ſo far apart, as you ſometimes think. There is often but a ſtep between them. And not only ſo, but you may be well and dead the ſame moment. Time and eternity join: And you may go from life to endleſs happineſs or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery the ſame inſtant. How very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant then is it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be prepared for ſudden death? You muſt then be dutiful children. For, if you die without this ſpirit, what will become of your poor ſouls? You will not be carried to heaven in the arms of kind angels, but you muſt be ſent down to hell. And there you will lye in tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment till the judgment of the great day. Then you will be brought up in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, and anguiſh to be condemned, and forced immediately down again, with all the devils and damned crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And when in hell, there you muſt lye millions, and millions and millions of years. You m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt lye there an ENDLESS, ENDLESS FOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>EVER. You, and Judas, and all loſt creatures will wiſh you had never been born. For, to be in hell will be unſpeakable worſe, than not to be
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:018195_0058_0FA5C05D8AEAA5B0"/>
at all. It is, in ſhort, infinitely better not to be, than to be, and be damned. For, when you have been in hell as many millions of years, as there are ſtars in the ſkies, and as many mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions more as there are drops of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the ſea and little grains of duſt in the whole earth; after all this your torment will be only juſt begun, and no nearer the end. Can you bear it? O, no!! For you cannot even bear your hand in the fire a ſingle mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. What then will your poor ſouls do in hell? But I told you of this before, and don't know how to think of it. Yet this muſt be your portion if you will not be dutiful: For God is ſo holy, and powerful that you cannot eſcape his wrath if you live in ſin.</p>
            <p>BUT, if you obey your parents in the Lord, you will be ready to die at any time whatever. And if Chriſt ſhould ſend the meſſenger of death to call you this night before the bar of God, inſtead of being frighted at the proſpect, you might think of it with pleaſure: And ſay as a little child did once to her parents, while weeping over her, juſt before ſhe left the world. "My dear father and mother, don't mourn for me: You might well mourn for me if I were to go into utter darkneſs;
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:018195_0059_0FA5C05E426910C0"/>
but I am going to God in heaven. I long to be with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. O Lord let thy angels come and carry me." What a lovely child was this? But all children who love Chriſt may die in this manner. For the love of Chriſt triumphs over death, takes away its ſting, and makes the king of terrors appear as peaceable as a lamb. For if you die with the dutiful ſpirit, you will not be dragged down to hell by hateful devils, but the King of Glory will open the door of heaven and the loving angels will carry you immediatly in. And all the bleſſed company will rejoice, and meet you with open arms. A heaven, of eternal love and friendſhip will be your home. You will love God and he will love you.— You will be his children, and he will be your father. All will be love and happineſs. In this world you are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſin, pain diſtreſs, and death, but none of theſe will enter with you into heaven. They all belong to the other ſtate. In one word, you will be as holy and happy as children can be. For you will be like Chriſt, and will live with him, and enjoy him moſt ſweetly forever.
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:018195_0060_0FA5C05EF66C3488"/>
What then can be more beautiful, than for children to obey their parents in the Lord? What more lovely than to glorify God and enjoy him forever. For this is the chief end of man.</p>
            <p>But, as hinted before, I cannot ſhew how beautiful it is for children to obey their parents in the Lord. It is one of the ſweet beauties of holineſs. And the beauty of all beauties that children are capable of: and much better felt than deſcribed.—It is therefore the wann deſire of a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>l good people, that you ſhould taſte of this lovely beauty, then you will know what it is in reality and not before.</p>
            <p>I HAVE time to ſay only this; as Chriſt hath made me your miniſter, I hope you will find me faithful to your ſouls in giving proper <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For he will ſoon call me before the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-ſeat, to tell him in the preſence of angels and men, what inſtructions I have given little children as well as others. And as you muſt ſtand before the bar of God with me. I hope you will wiſely improve the good inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons you receive from parents, me, and others.

that the little heathen may not riſe up in judgement againſt you. We have, my tender children but a little while to live together. We ſhall ſoon die. And whether I ſhall live to ſee a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of you grow up, or be taken away the firſt, God only knows. But this we know, that we ſhall all quickly ſleep in the duſt. Pray then, let us not live as we ſleep, and dream life away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the improvement of it. But, let us wake up from the dead ſleep of ſin, and attend to duty with all our hearts.

and ſupplication. Let wiſdom keep your hearts, and true diſcretion guide your ſteps. Keep thy father's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment and forſake not the law of thy mother.</p>
            <p>I THOUGHT of a word to par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
