            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN the latter part of this Chapter, we have a mournful and yet manly <hi>Poem,</hi> which was compoſed by <hi>David</hi>; who was not only a <hi>mighty valiant Man, a man of War,</hi> but alſo <hi>the ſweet Pſalmiſt of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> an <hi>accompliſhed Poet,</hi> and one that could <hi>play well on an Inſtrument.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HE wrote this <hi>Military Elegy,</hi> on the mournful Occaſion of the overthrow and daughter of ſome of the People of the Lord,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:003589_0004_0FF833BF6260CFD0"/>
and particularly the <hi>tragical Death</hi> of <hi>Saul King of Iſrael,</hi> and his <hi>beloved Jonathan the King's Son.</hi>—</p>
            <p>There was <hi>War</hi> between the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> who were a <hi>valiant warlike People,</hi> and the <hi>Children of Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saul the King, (as becomes a brave General</hi>) led forth his Armies himſelf to the War: He marched and (as we may ſuppoſe) <hi>fought</hi> at the head of his <hi>armed Soldiers:</hi> He alſo took his <hi>Sons</hi> with him into the <hi>Camp</hi> and <hi>Field of Battle,</hi> and met the Forces of the <hi>Philiſtines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There enſued a <hi>bloody Battle</hi> between theſe <hi>gallant Armies</hi>: and alas! <hi>the Race is not to the ſwift, nor the Battle to the ſtrong.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Armies of the uncircumciſed prevailed and got the Day, and <hi>Iſrael fled before them, and fell down ſlain on the Mountains of Gilboa.</hi> 1 Sam. 31. <hi>begin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Philiſtines</hi> well knowing how to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue an Advantage, followed after <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſlew the <hi>valiant</hi> and <hi>worthy Sons</hi> of the King, even <hi>Jonathan, Abinadab,</hi> and <hi>Malchiſhua</hi>; and they wounded <hi>Saul</hi> the Lord's anointed with an <hi>Arrow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now when <hi>Saul</hi> ſaw the downfall of his heroic Sons, and many of his valiant Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, the overthrow of his Armies, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf wounded, and had in vain, asked his Armour-bearer to put an end to his Life, and ſo to his Anguiſh and Miſery, he fell on his

own Sword and died, <hi>as if he had not been anointed with Oyl</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Sam. 31 4.5. &amp; 11. v. of the Context.</note>.</p>
            <p>When the News of this was brought to <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Zicklag,</hi> by a young <hi>Amalekite, David and the Men that were with him rent their Cloths, and they mourned and wept and faſted until evening, for</hi> Saul <hi>and for</hi> Jonathan <hi>his Son, and for the People of the Lord, and for the Houſe of Iſrael, becauſe they were fallen by the Sword.</hi> Verſe 11 &amp; 12 of our Context.</p>
            <p>And when <hi>David</hi> had done Juſtice on the <hi>Amalekite,</hi> and was retired, he gave further Vent to his noble Paſſions, in this mournful and yet ſublime <hi>Funeral Song,</hi> at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of which ſtand the Words of our Text.</p>
            <p>In which he celebrates the <hi>Military Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments</hi> and <hi>Atchievements</hi> of theſe <hi>Heroes,</hi> and laments their Death.</p>
            <p>The Elegy is intirely <hi>Military,</hi> as one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves <note n="†" place="bottom">Rev. Mr. <hi>Symmes,</hi> in his <hi>Level lamented.</hi>
               </note>, and 'tis plain the deſign of it was, to fire the Ambition of the <hi>Militia</hi> of <hi>Judah,</hi> and ſtir up in them a <hi>Martial</hi> Spirit, to quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en them by <hi>Military Exerciſes,</hi> to endeavour to <hi>excel in warlike Skill and Accompliſhments</hi>; that they might equal and excel the Skill and Valour of thoſe Worthies, and riſe up in their ſtead, and boldly carry on the <hi>War</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Enemies, and avenge the Death of their <hi>King,</hi> his Sons, and the other valiant
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:003589_0006_0FF833C2E5EAA270"/>
Soldiers that fell with them; and retrieve the Honour and Credit they had loſt by this overthrow.</p>
            <p>Agreably,</p>
            <p>In the Text, he <hi>bad them teach the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Judah the Uſe of the Bow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>This, as <hi>Junius</hi> obſerves, expreſſes the Deſign of <hi>David,</hi> that this Song might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite and provoke them to addict themſelves to Martial Exerciſes, and to acquire Skill in the <hi>uſe of the Bow,</hi> which is here put for all warlike Weapons then in Faſhion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And for the ſame Reaſon and with the ſame View he tells them, that <hi>good Soldiers</hi> are the <hi>Beauty of Iſrael</hi>; he minds them of the Valour, of the Honour and Succeſs of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jonathan,</hi> and mentions other things in the Elegy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> was now upon the Death of <hi>Saul,</hi> not only <hi>Generaliſſimo of the Forces of Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>Captain of the Lord's Hoſts,</hi> but the <hi>King of Iſrael,</hi> tho' not yet in poſſeſſion of the <hi>Throne</hi> by the Act of <hi>Coronation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And notwithſtanding his Mourning, he was not forgetful of his Duty, nor unmindful of the Safety and Felicity, the Honour and Reputation of his Kingdom and People.</p>
            <p>But at the ſame time that he publiſhes this Song, he ſends forth this wiſe and proper <hi>Order</hi> and Command, or publiſhes this <hi>Law</hi> (as one calls it) therewith, to the Officers of the <hi>Troops</hi> and <hi>trained Bands,</hi> and to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

concerned in thoſe Affairs in the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi>; (as I may have occaſion to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve hereafter) that they ſhould take care that the Soldiers ſhould be taught the Art, Skill and Practice of War, the Uſe of <hi>Martial Weapons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He that writes this Hiſtory mentions this <hi>Order,</hi> as he enters on the Recitation of the <hi>Song,</hi> to the Honour of this great <hi>King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I think our Text may well be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood <hi>in this Senſe,</hi> both becauſe of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection &amp; Deſign of this Story and <hi>Elegy,</hi> and becauſe of the Idiom and Phraſe of the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> (as far as I can judge of it) tho' there are great Men that ſuppoſe this Expreſſion, <hi>He bad them teach the Children of Judah the Bow,</hi> means, he bad them teach them this <hi>Song,</hi> to which he prefixes the Title, <hi>Kaſheth,</hi> or the <hi>Bow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I can't ſatisfy my ſelf with that Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but allowing it, yet even the Patrons of it, allow the Poem to have the ſame View and Deſign, and ſo the former Senſe is ſtill good; and having good Authority on my ſide, I may be allowed to take my Text in that Senſe.</p>
            <p>And underſtanding it ſo, we may obſerve here,</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Judah</hi> was the <hi>Tribe</hi> to which <hi>David</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed; and his chief Dependance was upon them for Martial Exploits, and for Conſtancy and Fidelity to their Prince: They were alſo a profeſſing and religious People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They</hi> muſt then be firſt taught the <hi>Art of War</hi>; not that the other Tribes were to be neglected; a General will have his own Company good Soldiers.</p>

in this <hi>Poem</hi> for his Skill in the uſe of it, and the Exploits he had done by it. He had before this, his <hi>Artillery</hi> and <hi>Bow.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20.40.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> himſelf doubtleſs well underſtood it; and the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> were very expert and ſucceſsful in the uſe of it. By this they gained the Victory juſt before mentioned o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Iſrael</hi>: With the <hi>Bow</hi> they ſlew <hi>Saul</hi> and his Sons.</p>
            <p>'Tis poſſible <hi>Archery</hi> was not ſo much in uſe now among the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> as it had been; partly becauſe of the <hi>glorious Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory David</hi> had lately obtained over <hi>Goliah</hi> with a <hi>Sling</hi> and <hi>Stone,</hi> and partly becauſe <hi>Slings</hi> were <hi>cheaper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this was not out of Uſe; for ſome of them who <hi>came to David to Zicklag, who were mighty Men, and helpers of the War,</hi> were arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Bows</hi> as well as <hi>Slings,</hi> 1 Chron. 12.1, 2.</p>
            <p>But on this Occaſion, that they might not be inferiour to their Enemies in any part of <hi>Military Skill,</hi> or the uſe of any Weapon, and that they might fight and overcome the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies with their own Weapons, they were to be taught a more exact and perfect Skill in the <hi>uſe of the Bow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or as is generally thought, by <hi>Bow</hi> here is meant all <hi>Military Inſtruments,</hi> and ſo the Command is in general, teach them all the <hi>Art of War,</hi> and the uſe of every <hi>warlike Weapon,</hi> but <hi>eſpecially ſuch as will be of moſt
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:003589_0011_0FF833CAE543EEA8"/>
Advantage to fight againſt the bloody Philiſtines,</hi> and enable them to avenge the Death of their <hi>King,</hi> and the other brave <hi>Soldiers</hi> that fell with him.</p>
            <p>This experienced <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Commander</hi> knew very well of how much Importance it was to have a <hi>well diſciplined Army,</hi> of ſuch as were <hi>expert and skilful</hi> in the uſe of all <hi>Martial Weapons,</hi> to meet, fight and vanquiſh an Enemy that was ſuch.</p>
            <p>And 'tis not impoſſible but ſome defect of <hi>Diſcipline</hi> and <hi>Skill</hi> among the Soldiers of <hi>Judah,</hi> or ſome dejection of Spirits on this Overthrow, might excite him the more at this Time to give out this <hi>Command.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what was then reaſonable, honourable and beautiful among a People, is ſo now. If valiant and accompliſhed Soldiers were the Beauty and Safety of a People then, they are ſo in our Days.</p>
            <p>In further ſpeaking to theſe Words, I ſhall (by Divine Help) briefly conſider theſe three Things, (which naturally offer themſelves to our Thoughts) <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>It is very deſirable, and what God's People ought to take care of, that their</hi> Sons <hi>be taught and trained up in the</hi> Military Art and Skill; <hi>or that they be</hi> expert, accompliſhed and valiant Soldiers.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>I ſhall conſider what Influence the Example in our Text may have on thoſe who have (in our Days) the</hi> Command <hi>of the</hi> Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia. <hi>And</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:003589_0012_0FF833CC7471C418"/>Thirdly, <hi>That it is deſirable that a People be taught</hi> that Manner of warring, <hi>and Skill in uſing thoſe</hi> Weapons of War, <hi>which may be of moſt Service againſt the Enemies they have moſt Apprehenſions from.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I am to conſider, that 'tis very deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and what God's People ought to take care of, that their <hi>Sons</hi> be taught and trained up in the <hi>Military Art and Skill</hi>; or, that they be <hi>expert, accompliſhed and valiant Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſee this was one of the very firſt things this wiſe and prudent <hi>King</hi> took care of, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he became <hi>King,</hi> to give Orders that his Subjects ſhould bring up their <hi>Sons</hi> in <hi>Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Exerciſes,</hi> that they ſhould teach them the <hi>Martial Art,</hi> and the uſe of <hi>warlike Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons.</hi> He would have their <hi>young Men early</hi> taught it, and all grow more dexterous at it.</p>
            <p>And he puts into their Hands at the ſame Time this <hi>Poem,</hi> not only to eterniſe the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of his <hi>Heroes,</hi> but to <hi>fire</hi> their <hi>martial Courage,</hi> and ſtir them up to Emulation, and to fill them with deſires of acquiring the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> which belongs to <hi>skilful</hi> and <hi>brave Soldiers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Agreably he gives this <hi>Command,</hi> as we may ſuppoſe, not only to <hi>Soldiers</hi> and <hi>Field-Officers,</hi> but to the <hi>Civil Rulers,</hi> and to thoſe <hi>Parents</hi> that had <hi>Sons</hi> fit to be educated therein, as I have above obſerved.</p>

               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:003589_0013_0FF833CF5E779750"/>And there is as much Reaſon why our Sons at this Day ſhould be taught this <hi>Skill</hi> and <hi>Art,</hi> as there was in the Days of <hi>David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have ſeen and felt by unhappy Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that a People's Enjoyment of Goſpel Privileges, is no effectual Security againſt <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies</hi> and <hi>Wars</hi>: The Time is not (we may fear) yet come, when <hi>Men may beat their Swords into Plow ſhares, and their Spears into Pruning-hooks; that Nation ſhall not lift up Sword againſt Nation, neither ſhall they learn War any more</hi>

            <p>Neither is the <hi>Profeſſion of Religion</hi> in the leaſt inconſiſtent with a <hi>Military Spirit,</hi> and the <hi>Art of War</hi>: The moſt holy and wiſe of all Men have practiced War, and have been famous for their Valour and Atchievements therein, as <hi>Abraham, Moſes, Joſhua, David</hi> and others; and this Command was given to <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> God's own People.

               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:003589_0014_0FF833D14E98C548"/>Neither is this unſeaſonable at this Day; altho' thro' the abundant Goodneſs of <hi>GOD,</hi> by his Bleſſing on the wiſe <hi>Counſels</hi> and well ordered <hi>Negotiations</hi> of the <hi>beſt of Kings, our renowned and moſt rightful and gracious Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign GEORGE,</hi> there is now <hi>Peace</hi> in <hi>Europe,</hi> for which we bleſs GOD with all our Hearts.</p>
            <p>Nor becauſe, by the <hi>Bleſſing of God</hi> on the <hi>wiſe Adminiſtrations</hi> and <hi>prudent Managements</hi> of the <hi>Honourable Legiſlature</hi> of this <hi>Province,</hi> we have <hi>Peace</hi> in our <hi>Borders</hi> at preſent, and ſome proſpect of its continuance. <hi>Solomon</hi> had, and took care to have, <hi>Men of War, trained expert and valiant Soldiers,</hi> even in his <hi>peaceful Reign.</hi> 1 King. 9.22.

            <p>And who can tell what Changes there are in the right Hand of the <hi>Moſt High?</hi> or how ſoon we may again hear the <hi>Alarm of War,</hi> and be called forth to the <hi>Field of Battle</hi>?</p>
            <p>If we conſider our Backſlidings from, and our provoking Sins againſt <hi>God,</hi> we ſhall ſee but little Reaſon to hope for a long ſeries of <hi>Peace and Proſperity.</hi> And if we view the Actions and warlike Preparations of a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> who ſeem to make Peace only to gain Time to prepare for War; if we ſee what they are doing even within the <hi>Limits</hi> of our own <hi>Province</hi> (as is ſuppoſed) and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Principles that act them with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to us, whom they call <hi>Hereticks,</hi> tho' falſly, and the <hi>Incendiaries</hi> which are among them, I believe all will allow, that this is
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:003589_0015_0FF833D2DD4C0BB8"/>
not a Time to let the <hi>Military Spirit</hi> &amp; <hi>Skill</hi> intirely die and come to nothing among us; to let our <hi>Swords</hi> ruſt in their Scabbords, and our <hi>Guns</hi> grow unfit for Service, and be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely uncapable on any Occaſion to take up Arms, or have no Men that know how to handle or uſe Arms.</p>
            <p>And I hope that an ESSAY to revive Martial Exerciſes, Skill and Valour among us, will not be thought unſeaſonable, nor be unacceptable, (tho' coming from the <hi>moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualified of Chriſt's Miniſters</hi>) ſince I am called to ſuch a Service on this Occaſion.</p>
            <p>It appears then, that even in our <hi>Days</hi> and <hi>Land,</hi> God's People ought to take care to have their <hi>Sons</hi> taught the Military <hi>Art.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And perhaps there is as much need that ſuch a Command as our Text ſhould be giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to the <hi>Field Officers</hi> and to the <hi>Parents</hi> of <hi>New-England,</hi> as ever there was to any Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: For where ever was the <hi>Martial Spirit</hi> and <hi>Skill,</hi> and <hi>Military Exerciſes</hi> at a lower Ebb, than among us? and where ever was there a People that appeared leſs concerned about their own Defence and Safety, than we in general are?

            <p>And where ever was there a People more envied and maligned by other Nations than we are, except <hi>Iſrael</hi>?</p>
            <p>It would be a moſt beautiful and deſirea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

thing, to ſee a <hi>Military Spirit</hi> revive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us; and how neceſſary this may be found we know not, but may be too late convinced by the unhappy Conſequents of the want of it. How delightful and deſirable it is to have our Sons, <hi>Sons of Valour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown,</hi> expert and brave Soldiers, our <hi>Officers</hi> becoming their <hi>Poſts,</hi> and honoured in them. And as our Security gives Vigour and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to our Enemies, this would curb their Pride and damp their Spirits, and the <hi>Terror</hi> of our <hi>Arms</hi> might force them to be at Peace with us.

            <p>Our <hi>Sons</hi> then ſhould be acquainted with <hi>Military Exerciſes,</hi> and learn the <hi>Art of War</hi>; their Hands ſhould be taught to War, and their Fingers to fight. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144.1.

            </p>
            <p>Once more, their <hi>Martial Fire</hi> ſhould be <hi>kindled and blown up,</hi> and they ſhould learn to be cautious of running into <hi>needleſs Dangers,</hi> but yet when there is need, to <hi>deſpiſe Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and face their Enemies without Fear or Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardiſe,</hi> and <hi>boldly to jeopard their Lives unto the Death,</hi> (like <hi>Deborah's</hi> Soldiers, <hi>Judges,</hi> Chap. 5.) <hi>in the high places of the Field,</hi> when called to <hi>fight the Battles of the LORD, to fight for their Lives, Liberties, Religion, and Cities and People of their GOD.</hi> But</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> But the Example in our Text alſo reſpects ſuch as are honoured with <hi>Commiſſions</hi> under the CAPTAIN-GENERAL and Chief Commander.</p>
            <p>The Command in the Text may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be given particularly to them; and if it be incumbent on the <hi>chief Officers</hi> and the <hi>Legiſlature</hi> to give them <hi>Orders,</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands

and Laws for the <hi>Militia,</hi> ſurely they ſhould pay a due Honour and Regard to them.</p>
            <p>I may therefore with <hi>due deference</hi> ſay, this Matter belongs alſo to the other <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders</hi> of the <hi>Armies</hi> of this our <hi>Iſrael;</hi> to the <hi>Captains of Thouſands,</hi> and the <hi>Captains of Hundreds</hi>; or in the Language of the preſent Day, to the <hi>Colonels,</hi> to the <hi>Majors,</hi> to the <hi>Captains,</hi> &amp;c. every one that bears a <hi>Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> in the Field, is to uſe his Endeavour to <hi>revive</hi> and <hi>encourage Military Exerciſes,</hi> and the Martial Spirit, Art and Courage among us.</p>
            <p>And in order hereto, to labour to excel in <hi>warlike Skill,</hi> and make himſelf an <hi>accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Soldier,</hi> and Maſter of the <hi>Art of War,</hi> which he is to teach others; to take care to fill up and honour the Office he ſuſtains, and maintain the Dignity and Authority of it.</p>
            <p>If there be any <hi>Honour</hi> in your <hi>Commiſſions,</hi> as ſurely Sirs there is; then do not loſe it, nor let it ſuffer, and be brought into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, by ſlighting &amp; deſpiſing it your ſelves, and ſuffering others, or giving them Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to trample on it.</p>
            <p>I may ſay further, ſuch are to endeavour to inſtruct their Soldiers in the Art of War, and the Uſe of warlike Weapons, and make them expert therein: And in order hereto, to attend with dure Care, and in the proper Seaſons, on Military Exercies on Days of Troopings, Trainings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this for the
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:003589_0023_0FF833E0CECCE508"/>
true and noble End thereof; not for <hi>Sport</hi> and <hi>Mirth,</hi> nor to give magnificent <hi>Treats</hi> to your Soldiers, which is ſo deſtructive to Martial Skill and Valour, and ſo often fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates the great Ends of Trainings; but for the advancement of Military Art and Skill, and to fit your Soldiers for <hi>Actual Service.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I may ſay further, our Text may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to concern <hi>Parents</hi> and <hi>Maſters,</hi> they are to ſend their Children and Servants to <hi>Trainings,</hi> and by all proper Means endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to train them up in Military Exerciſes and Skill.</p>
            <p>And this <hi>Art</hi> and theſe <hi>Exerciſes</hi> are too <hi>noble, manly</hi> and <hi>honourable,</hi> to be below or unbecoming the Dignity of the greateſt. The excellent Example of our Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> who trained up all his Servants in the Affairs of War, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.14. ſhould excite us hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
            <p>And all Soldiers ought conſcientiouſly to attend their Duty herein: If they are to be <hi>taught,</hi> then they muſt endeavour to learn <hi>War.</hi> They are not to ſlight, nor careleſly neglect to attend, much leſs deſignedly avoid the Exerciſes preſcribed by Law, for their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation in this manly and neceſſary <hi>Art.</hi> They are not to come to the Field to mock and deride their Officers, nor meerly for Sport and Diverſion; but with hearty deſires and ſincere endeavours to acquaint themſelves with all the Exerciſes, and every part of the Art of War.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:003589_0024_0FF833E2BB970140"/>But 'tis time I proceed to the third and laſt Thing I propoſed for clearing the Text, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>That 'tis deſireable that a People ſhould be taught that</hi> Manner <hi>of</hi> warring, <hi>and the</hi> Uſe of thoſe Martial Weapons <hi>which may be of moſt Service againſt thoſe Enemies that they are moſt likely to have War with.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Philiſtines</hi> were an Enemy that the King and People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> at <hi>that time</hi> moſt feared; they had long been a Scourge to them; and they had a well trained Army, skilful in the <hi>Art,</hi> and expert in the Uſe and handling of the Weapons of War; bold in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturing, and couragious in fighting.</p>
            <p>Now a great part of their Strength lay in their Dexterity and Skill in the <hi>uſe of the Bow</hi>; they were <hi>expert Archers,</hi> as we learn from the Account of the <hi>Battle</hi> with <hi>Saul</hi> and his Armies, forecited 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 31. and as has been above noted.</p>
            <p>And now being <hi>fluſhed</hi> with the late <hi>Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> they were like to be undaunted in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Onſet,</hi> and therefore <hi>David</hi> would have his Soldiers now taught the <hi>uſe of the Bow</hi>; (but not ſo as to neglect the uſe of other Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons) that they might meet their Enemies with the ſame Weapon, and excel them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and vanquiſh them therewith.</p>
            <p>And this ſhows how proper and commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able 'tis for God's People to teach their Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, if not the very ſame Weapons that
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:003589_0025_0FF833E9204F4D20"/>
their Enemies uſe, yet at leaſt ſuch as are of moſt Service to fight againſt them with.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Sons</hi> are then not only to be taught the <hi>Art of War</hi> in general, but that manner of fighting and carrying on a War in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and the uſe of thoſe Weapons which are moſt likely to ſucceed in proſecuting a War, (if ever there be Occaſion, which God grant there never may) againſt the Enemies we have moſt Reaſon to fear that we may have War with. And the Caſe may be ſo with a People, that they may have Occaſion and Need to have their Soldiers acquainted with all ſorts of warring, all manner of fighting, and the uſe of all kinds of Military Weapons; they may have Occaſion to acquaint them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves not only with the Weapons and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of War with one, and that a neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nation, but with different and diſtant People: and may it not be ſo within this Land?</p>
            <p>And he will be a <hi>finiſhed Soldier,</hi> that can find, fight and conquer his Enemies in the Thicket of the Woods; and immediately fall into a marſhalled and regular Army, or into a diſciplined Troop, and fight and overcome in open Field; and alſo excel again on the mighty Deep, and underſtand the beſt Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of fighting on the <hi>Sea.</hi> And <hi>Soldiers</hi> ſhould not only learn to <hi>handle their Arms,</hi> and uſe their Weapons, but it becomes them to ſtudy their Enemies, to know the <hi>Weapons
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:003589_0026_0FF833EAAD5E0B50"/>
of War</hi> they <hi>uſe,</hi> and in which they are moſt <hi>expert</hi>; to know where their Strength lies, and ſo how they may with the greateſt Eaſe defend themſelves, and annoy and vanquiſh their Enemies.</p>
            <p>In this lies a very conſiderable part of the <hi>Accompliſhments</hi> of a <hi>Soldier.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame <hi>Weapons,</hi> the ſame Manner of <hi>fighting</hi> that the diſciplined Armies of <hi>Europe</hi> uſe and practice to Advantage, would not be ſo ſerviceable againſt the Enemies that have moſt troubled <hi>New-England.</hi> And ſo on the contrary.</p>
            <p>And ſince we are not ſure but we may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain be moleſted by them, or others like them; and ſince 'tis not impoſſible that we may be invaded by more regular Armies from beyond the Seas, and be called to fight with valiant and marſhalled Armies, and diſcipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Troops in the open Field; I would here (as my Text leads me) <hi>humbly offer</hi> to Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, whether it is not deſireable, and would not be prudent in this People of the LORD, and that even now tho' in a Time of Peace,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. <hi>That ſome of the young and valiant Sons of</hi> New-England, <hi>ſhould be trained up in the way of fighting, and the uſe of thoſe warlike In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments that would be of moſt Service in a

War againſt the</hi> Salvages of the Wilderneſs <hi>and their</hi> Confederates <note n="*" place="bottom">'Tis with ſingular Satisfaction to me, that His EXCELLENCY has in his great Wiſdom and Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Concern and Care for the laſting Peace and Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of this Province, recommended the ſame Thing that I have here humbly offered, to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable General Aſſembly, as I find in his Speech to the Honourable Court, on the 1ſt of <hi>June</hi> 1732. which I was not ſo happy as to ſee, till after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery of this Diſcourſe, it being printed the ſame Day.</note>?</p>
            <p>Might it not be of unſpeakable Service to this Land, if ſome of our brave, hardy and intrepid <hi>Youths,</hi> and others in our Frontier Towns and elſewhere, might be encouraged by ſome Means to acquaint themſelves more perfectly with the Woods, and that even in the Land of thoſe that have been our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and find out the <hi>Hants</hi> and <hi>lurking Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> of thoſe who have done us moſt hurt; that if ever they ſhould be called forth, they may know where and how to find out our Enemies, and fight and conquer them even when they are at <hi>home.</hi> That they inure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to <hi>Travel,</hi> and learn to endure <hi>Hardneſs</hi>; learn to <hi>travel</hi> in the <hi>Woods</hi> and <hi>Swamps,</hi> in which there is a great <hi>Art</hi>; and to know the <hi>Hills, Mountains</hi> and <hi>Rivers</hi>; that they may not be any where at a loſs; and alſo to make themſelves <hi>perfect</hi> in the <hi>uſe</hi> of thoſe Weapons which are moſt adapted to ſuch Services.</p>
            <p>We have ſeen ſomething of the Advantages
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:003589_0028_0FF833EF72CA80A0"/>
of this; and it is much to be wiſhed, that we might not be dejected, nor let ſuch a Spirit die among us for want of Countenance and Encouragement: And that altho' ſome ſuch mighty and valiant Soldiers <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>viz.</hi> The expert and valiant Capt. <hi>Lovewell, Robbins, Frye, Harwood, Fullam,</hi> and ſeveral others.</note> have fallen glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly fighting for us in the Fields of the Woods.</p>
            <p>And would it not alſo be of great Service to us, if <hi>Troops,</hi> which have been ſuch a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to theſe Enemies, and ſuch a Safe-guard to us in former Days, might be encouraged? and that a proper Proportion of our <hi>Soldiers</hi> might by ſuitably Exerciſes be made expert and skilful in every part of the Art of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging of and fighting with the <hi>Horſe</hi>? of which we have that Character given <hi>Job</hi> 39.19. and on.</p>
            <p>The Advantage hereof might be unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. If it were known among thoſe Nations, that we are every way prepared with expert and valiant <hi>Troopers</hi> and other Soldiers, this might happily prevent much Bloodſhed, and perhaps prevent there ever being another War. But if there ſhould be nothing of this Nature, we may well fear that they who have ſeldom or never been at Peace with us, but becauſe they feared our Forces, or to ſerve themſelves of us, will (when they ſee us careleſs) again get Heart and Courage, and moleſt us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:003589_0029_0FF833F102B9EBF8"/>And may we not think, that ſome of the Nations of the <hi>Indians</hi> have been (by God) left to prove us by, that we <hi>might know</hi> and <hi>to teach us War,</hi> as ſome of the Nations of <hi>Canaan</hi> were? <hi>Judges</hi> 3. <hi>begin.</hi> And ought we not to endeavour to anſwer God's juſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations from us herein?</p>
            <p>I would juſt ſay, Is it not to be wiſhed, that our <hi>Frontiers</hi> might be ſettled in a more defenſive Poſture? and that our <hi>Forts</hi> and <hi>Garriſons</hi> might be always kept in due <hi>Repair?</hi> ſtored with good Arms and Ammunition, and manned with expert effective and valiant Commanders and Soldiers?</p>
            <p>But after all, will it not be allowed in me, if I take this Opportunity unexpectedly put into my Hands by <hi>God,</hi> to ſay thus publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Is there not yet a more <hi>excellent</hi> Way? I mean to overcome and win over to us the <hi>Indian Tribes,</hi> by obſerving ſtrict Juſtice in our Commerce with them, and by not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them large Quantities of ſpirituous Drink, which is ſo deſtructive to moſt of that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? and by uſing all poſſible Means and Methods to inſtruct them in and win them over to, the true and holy <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi>?</p>
            <p>From what I know of that People, I am fully perſwaded that ſuch <hi>Wiſdom would be much better than Weapons of War</hi> with them, and more effectually ſubdue them under us.</p>
            <p>And it may be well worthy Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Enquiry, Whether we <hi>as a People,</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:003589_0030_0FF833F2F41DC430"/>
have done all that God expects of us in this reſpect? and whether God has not formerly ſuffered them to be <hi>Pricks in our Eyes, and Thorns in our Sides,</hi> to excite us to a greater Care and Concern for their precious and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Souls?</p>
            <p>It is a <hi>lamentable</hi> Truth <note n="*" place="bottom">I ſay this, becauſe I know it by unhappy Experience.</note>, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> do much to debauch them, and in a dreadful degree (by bad Counſel, and by giving and ſelling them <hi>inebriating Liquors,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Laws of <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>good Laws of this Land</hi> againſt ſo ſinful and deſtructive a Practice) prevent the Efficacy that it might be hoped the Goſpel might otherwiſe have upon them, where they enjoy it.

            <p>And will it not be pleaſing to God, and profitable even to us, if there be ſome <hi>effectual Way</hi> found, to have <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>well qualified Miſſionaries</hi> ſent among them? and that there be ſuch Encouragement given by thoſe who have the Management of this Affair put into their Hands by <hi>God,</hi> as would be effectual in ſome good meaſure, to excite <hi>ſuch</hi> among the <hi>Sons of the Prophets</hi> in our Land, who are Men <hi>well qualified</hi> with <hi>natural Strength of Body,</hi> and accompliſhed with the <hi>Endowments</hi> of good <hi>Literature</hi> and proper <hi>Diſpoſitions</hi> and

               <hi>Graces,</hi> to undertake a <hi>Service</hi> which will try the <hi>Powers</hi> and <hi>Graces</hi> of the greateſt Men? Tho' this be a <hi>Digreſſion,</hi> yet I hope my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Concern for ſome of that Nation, will be eſteemed a ſufficient Excuſe for me<note n="*" place="bottom">Here again I cannot forbear (with the greateſt <hi>Gratitude</hi> to <hi>God)</hi> to expreſs my very great Joy, to find in His EXCELLENCY's late Speech be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned, a Paragraph, wherein the Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement and Support of <hi>Miſſionaries</hi> among the <hi>Eaſtern Indians</hi> is recommended to the Honourable General Court. 'Tis with Admiration and Praiſe to <hi>God,</hi> that I read and hear what pious and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Perſons have done and are doing in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> for the Advancement of pure Religion among the <hi>Indians</hi> here: And I cannot but ardent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſh and pray, that this Province may join (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable to the pious Propoſal of his Excellency) and do all that is proper for the Advancement of that glorious Deſign, wherein the Honour of <hi>God</hi> and our own Felicity is ſo much concerned.</note>.</p>
            <p>I proceed to ſay,</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. <hi>Is it not very deſireable, and will it not be very honourable and profitable, that</hi> others <hi>be taught thoſe Military Exerciſes, and the uſe of thoſe Weapons that may be moſt ſuitable to encounter Regular Troops and diſciplined Armies in the open Field</hi>?</p>
            <p>Indeed 'tis proper that all <hi>Soldiers</hi> ſhould be taught <hi>this</hi>; and particularly thoſe that inhabit the <hi>Sea-Coaſts,</hi> and are moſt expoſed to the <hi>Invaſion</hi> of any foreign <hi>Prince</hi> or <hi>Power.</hi> Such ſhould be exerciſed and skilled in the <hi>Manner of fighting,</hi> and the uſe of thoſe <hi>Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:003589_0032_0FF833F75135DA70"/>
and that <hi>Armour</hi> which are moſt uſed among the warlike Nations round about. This is alſo of very great Importance, and 'tis pity it ſhould ever be diſcountenanced, diſcouraged or come to nothing.</p>
            <p>And I cannot be pleaſed with the Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch as argue, that becauſe this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable <hi>Artillery Company</hi> are not taught the Manner of fighting uſed by the <hi>Salvages in the Wilderneſs,</hi> ſo much as the more noble and manly Exerciſes of the more poliſhed and civilized Nations; and becauſe they are not called forth to fight in the Woods; that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they and their Exerciſes are to be ſligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and diſcountenanced; and that 'tis too great an Honour done to them <hi>annually,</hi> to keep up the Solemnities of this Day.</p>
            <p>Surely our honoured <hi>Fathers</hi> in the <hi>Civil Government</hi> and the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> did not think ſo: And if theſe Things were intirely laid aſide, 'tis much to be feared that in time our Caſe would be like that of <hi>Laiſh</hi> before-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I can't think but theſe Things have and may have an happy Influence on the Military Affairs of the Province, as long as they have the Smiles and Countenance of our honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Legiſlature,</hi> and of the venerable <hi>Miniſtry</hi> of the <hi>Province.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I may juſt add thirdly and laſtly,</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. <hi>Is it not proper and deſirable, that ſome among this People ſhould be taught the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods and the uſe of Inſtruments proper for</hi> Sea-Fight?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:003589_0033_0FF833F8DEAED7D8"/>Valiant and expert <hi>Admirals</hi> and <hi>Sea-Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> are as honourable and uſeful as Officers in the Field; and <hi>gallant</hi> Soldiers on the <hi>Seas</hi> are Men highly to be <hi>eſteemed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Engliſh Navy,</hi> and the <hi>unequalled Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers</hi> in the <hi>Britiſh Fleet,</hi> have been no ſmall part of the <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Safety</hi> of the Realm for a long Time; and 'tis pity we ſhould ever loſe the <hi>Command</hi> of the Seas.</p>
            <p>Would it not then be well, if our <hi>Sailors</hi> and thoſe of our Brethren who are called to do Buſineſs on the mighty Waters, might be made expert Soldiers alſo?</p>
            <p>Thus I have (as God has enabled me) conſidered this part of the holy Scriptures; and I think I have advanced nothing but what (without Force) flowed from it, in the Senſe I have underſtood it, and what is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable to the <hi>Analogy of Faith,</hi> and in ſome meaſure applicable to the <hi>Occaſion</hi> of <hi>this Day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Application</hi> ſhall be in few Words.</p>
            <p>And in general, Let what has been offered, ſerve to excite all the <hi>Lord's People</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to <hi>revive</hi> a <hi>Martial Spirit</hi> among the Children of <hi>New-England</hi>; and do what they can to encourage the teaching and acquiring the Military Art, Skill and Valour.</p>
            <p>This was the chief Deſign of our Text, and of this <hi>Elegy,</hi> (as all agree) even to ſtir up a warlike Spirit, Emulation and Valour, and quicken to teach and learn the Art of War among the Sons of <hi>Judah,</hi> as was before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:003589_0034_0FF833FAF23034A0"/>And my Deſign has been in this Diſcourſe, to advance the <hi>Glory of God</hi> in promoting the ſame good End; and I ſhall think I have been Inſtrumental in doing good Service for God and this his People, if this imperfect Diſcourſe may be bleſſed and made Service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to promote theſe Things.</p>
            <p>And will every one be intreated and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with to do what is proper in his Place, to promote Skill and Valour among our Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers?</p>
            <p>And the noble <hi>Example</hi> of this <hi>valorous and renowned General and King,</hi> is with Submiſſion, humbly propoſed to Your EXCELLENCY.</p>
            <p>And we truſt that the honourable General Court will be <hi>intreated</hi> to join herein, if not by making <hi>new Laws,</hi> even ſuch as might more effectually compel thoſe that are not to be drawn by a ſenſe of Honour and Duty to it, to endeavour to acquire <hi>Military Skill,</hi> by increaſing the Fines on Delinquents.</p>
            <p>Or if this be not thought proper, yet that there be ſome effectual Care taken, that the good <hi>Laws</hi> already provided may be duly executed; and not ſhamefully ſlighted, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected or evaded by Officers or common Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</p>
            <p>Again, will ſuch of whom it is expected that they make a <hi>Preſentation</hi> of the <hi>Names</hi> of thoſe who may be ſet at the <hi>Head</hi> of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Companies, (as Captains, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> be exhorted to take due Care therein, that they
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:003589_0035_0FF833FD4F69FBE0"/>
preſent ſuch as are every way qualified and accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>We would hope, that none will do any thing of that Importance for Favour or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, much leſs for the ſake of <hi>Gain</hi>: if they do, they muſt in a very great meaſure anſwer for the Defects of ſuch Officers, and bear the Reproach of it.</p>
            <p>For it is morally impoſſible for one <hi>Man</hi> perſonally to know the Character of every Man in ſuch a Province as this is.</p>
            <p>Further, Let all who have or may have the Honour to bear Commiſſions under the <hi>King</hi> in the <hi>Militia,</hi> be exhorted to honour your Poſts, whether higher or lower, and faithfully perform the <hi>Duties</hi> of them: Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to be <hi>expert, accompliſhed</hi> and moſt <hi>vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Soldiers your ſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here I would propoſe, Would it not be of Advantage in order hereto, if more of the Officers of the <hi>Militia</hi> would be pleaſed to liſt into the ARTILLERY-COMPANY?</p>
            <p>This <hi>Honourable Company</hi> was undoubtedly deſigned in its Original, to be a ſort of <hi>COL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEGE,</hi> to <hi>train up</hi> and <hi>Educate</hi> the <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>this People</hi> in <hi>Military Skill,</hi> and make them <hi>expert</hi> and valiant Soldiers <note n="*" place="bottom">See the <hi>Charter</hi> of this honourable Company, dated <hi>April</hi> 24. 1638. Thus careful were our Fathers to promote every thing that might be for the future Peace and Happineſs of their Poſterity.</note>.</p>
            <p>And many of the Commiſſion-Officers, the</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:003589_0036_0FF833FF4531DD50"/>Colonels, Majors, Captains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent and ſome of diſtant Regiments and Companies formerly (as I am told) did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to it; ſo that it was a <hi>Seminary</hi> of <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert Commanders,</hi> and was of extenſive Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceableneſs; and 'tis pity it ſhould not be ſo ſtill. Will then the Officers be intreated to join themſelves to it, and by this and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Means accompliſh themſelves more and more for the Offices they ſuſtain, and the Services expected from them.</p>
            <p>And then carefully and ſeaſonably attend Military Exerciſes, Days of Training, and the proper Buſineſs thereof; obſerve the Laws of the <hi>Militia,</hi> and endeavour to teach thoſe under you the Art of War: Maintain the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Authority of your Poſts, and ſuffer not your Selves and Offices to fall into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. Be known in your Offices, at leaſt in the <hi>Field.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And beware of every thing that may in the leaſt blemiſh your Character as <hi>Men of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> and as <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> Once more, be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to do what in you lies, by your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, Inſtructions and Authority, to keep your Soldiers from Intemperance and Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders on the Days ſet apart for Military Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, and on the Evenings following.</p>
            <p>And let the <hi>Miniſters of Chriſt</hi> do what is proper for them in their Place to encourage theſe Things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:003589_0037_0FF83400D04BFB58"/>And let Parents and Maſters alſo join here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; and let us not bring up our Children ſo tenderly and delicately, that they ſhall be unable to endure Hardneſs on any Occaſion.</p>
            <p>Finally, let all <hi>Soldiers</hi> be excited hence, duly, ſeriouſly and conſcientiouſly to attend <hi>Trainings,</hi> and all the <hi>Exerciſes</hi> in order to become good <hi>Soldiers</hi>: Don't ſlight nor ſhun them, nor attend them only for Diverſion, but make a Buſineſs of them in their Seaſon; and endeavour to make your ſelves Maſters of the <hi>Art of War.</hi> And O keep your ſelves from <hi>Effeminacy</hi> and <hi>Intemperance,</hi> which has been the ruin of ſo many Soldiers.</p>
            <p>All that now remains, is a more particular <hi>Application</hi> of theſe Things to the very <hi>anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and honourable Company</hi> who have called <hi>me</hi> to ſpeak to them in <hi>the Name of the LORD</hi> this Day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Honoured and much Eſteemed,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What has been now ſaid, has a ſingular Reference, and may (I think) with great Propriety be applied to <hi>You.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your <hi>Profeſſion</hi> as <hi>Soldiers</hi> is truly <hi>Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi> and much to be <hi>eſteemed</hi>; and alſo to be encouraged by all <hi>God's People</hi> in their ſeveral Stations and Relations: and your Exerciſes and Endeavours to make your ſelves accompliſhed Soldiers are laudable, and to be ſmiled upon, countenanced and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged.</p>

               <pb n="40" facs="unknown:003589_0038_0FF83402C5A6B378"/>And as this <hi>Company</hi> was many Years ſince erected, and very much honoured by the Magiſtrates of that Day, and favoured and countenanced by the Miniſtry; ſo it may be ſtill, if it be not in ſome meaſure owing to your ſelves.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Honourable General Court</hi> put great <hi>Honour</hi> upon this Company in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <note n="*" place="bottom">In the Privileges granted to it, and ſome Lands given to defray the Charges.</note>, and ſince; and they have lately put ſingular Marks of <hi>Reſpect</hi> on you; nor are the <hi>Ambaſſadors of Chriſt</hi> wanting in ſhowing you all that Regard that is proper for Men of our <hi>Character.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>GOD himſelf has alſo honoured your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, not only in the great Regards ſhown to expert and valiant Soldiers in the <hi>Sacred Oracles,</hi> but by taking to himſelf the Name of a <hi>Man of War,</hi> the <hi>Lord of Hoſts,</hi> the <hi>God of Armies,</hi> the <hi>Lord mighty in Battle,</hi> and the like.</p>
            <p>And hence it may be ſaid to you, undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> expect ſomething <hi>ſingular</hi> and <hi>extraordinary</hi> in and from <hi>you:</hi> You are to be <hi>skilful, expert</hi> and <hi>valiant Soldiers:</hi> 'tis expected that <hi>you</hi> be <hi>expert</hi> in the <hi>uſe of the Bow,</hi> or all Martial Weapons; that you la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to revive theſe <hi>Exerciſes,</hi> and the <hi>Art of War</hi>; and if a warlike Spirit decays every where elſe, we would hope to find it in the <hi>Artillery.</hi>

               <pb n="41" facs="unknown:003589_0039_0FF834052CD0A418"/>We lament every thing in this <hi>Company,</hi> that looks like a drawing back from that Martial Spirit Skill and Valour that was once your Glory.</p>
            <p>And 'tis much to be wiſhed, that more of the <hi>Commiſſion-Officers</hi> of the Regiments and Companies in the Country did belong to your Company, that they might be well (and they can't be too well) qualified and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed for the Poſts they ſuſtain, and the Service they are called to.</p>
            <p>And is not a <hi>Military Spirit,</hi> and a Love and Regard to the <hi>warlike Exerciſes</hi> and <hi>Art</hi> very much <hi>decay'd</hi> even in <hi>this Company?</hi> Are not your Days of <hi>Training</hi> very much diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, and thinly attended? have you not very many <hi>Delinquents</hi>?</p>
            <p>And have all that do attend, a due regard to promote <hi>Expertneſs</hi> in the Military Art in themſelves and others?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sirs,</hi> Conſider, you are <hi>Voluntiers</hi> herein, and you have Power by your <hi>Charter</hi> in ſome meaſure to regulate theſe Things.</p>

               <pb n="42" facs="unknown:003589_0040_0FF8340756155DB8"/>
and are <hi>effective Men,</hi> Men of known <hi>Loyalty, Vertue</hi> and <hi>Temperance</hi>?</p>
            <p>And when you chooſe your <hi>Officers,</hi> that you elect thoſe that are Men of a Marſhal and valiant Spirit, ſuch as you will willingly fight under if called to it; <hi>Men</hi> that are able to teach you the <hi>Art of War,</hi> and will do it; and ſuch as you may think can and will march before you, and lead you into the Field of Battle, and fight at the <hi>Head</hi> of your Company, and teach you Courage, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire you with Valour by their own Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?</p>
            <p>And ſuch as may be choſen, are to labour to be well qualified for what is juſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from them in ſuch Poſts and Stations.</p>
            <p>Further, as Endeavours to gain Dexterity and Expertneſs in the <hi>Art of War</hi> are truly laudable, ſo you are all to be exhorted, with Diligence to attend every Opportunity put into your Hands for the Advancement there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p>'Tis really diſhonourable for any of this <hi>Company</hi> to be <hi>Delinquents,</hi> when it may be helped.</p>
            <p>You may make Laws in a great meaſure for governing your ſelves; and 'tis in your Power to augment the <hi>Fines</hi>: and might it not be well to do it, if you ſhall find that a ſenſe of <hi>Honour</hi> and a love to theſe <hi>Exerciſes,</hi> and a deſire of the <hi>Glory</hi> of being <hi>expert</hi> and
