            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>GRATEFUL REFLEXIONS on the Divine Appearances in behalf of BRITAIN and its American Colonies, particularly in the Conqueſt of CANADA.</head>

               <q>
                  <hi>The</hi> LORD <hi>hath done great Things for us:</hi> whereof <hi>we are glad.</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>ONE grand Deſign of the <hi>holy Scriptures</hi> is to rebuke the common Stupidity of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate World, in not regarding the mighty Acts of Divine Providence; to call GOD to our Remembrance; and point our At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to his Agency, as the prime Efficient, the ſovereign Moderator of all Events, whether in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or moral World.—The Book of <hi>Pſalms,</hi> in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, is moſt excellently calculated to ſerve this important Deſign; eſpecially as Example carry's with it a peculiar Force, the moſt ſtriking and attractive to human Nature. For this Part of the ſacred Records very ſingularly abounds with admirable Patterns of devotional Exerciſes, Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Prayer and Praiſe: every where confeſſing and ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing GOD, in Character of the firſt Cauſe and ſupreme Agent, the original Creator and conſtant Preſerver, Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, Proprietor, and Lord of all; celebrating the
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:008599_0004_102F9552B44A4AA0"/>
Perfections of his Being and Government; recounting the Operations of his Hand; and rendering to Him all religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Honours and Acknowledgments,—many of which are in the Strain of Thankſgiving and Bleſſing,—which were recorded in Scripture for our Inſtruction and Imitation.</p>
            <p>In the Pſalm now before us (thought to be pen'd by <hi>Ezra,</hi> or ſome other Man of God, about the Time of the Jews Return from the Babyloniſh Captivity) we find the Church of Iſrael avouching the Agency of GOD in the glorious Tranſactions and happy Revolutions of that extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Day. They had lately ſeen very intereſting and ſurprizing Occurrences in Favour of Zion; which they contemplate with ſacred Pleaſure and Wonder. It is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votional Admiration and Joy they expreſs on this mirthful Occaſion; uttering their Words before the LORD, and aſcribing to Him the Praiſe of thoſe ſignal and proſperous Events they were now rejoycing in. <hi>The</hi> LORD (ſay they) <hi>hath done great Things for us:</hi> whereof <hi>we are glad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Amidſt the preſent Tumult of different and blending Paſſions, betwixt melancholy Reflections and pleaſant Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects intermingling with one another, on their ſudden e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merging out of Servitude and Sorrow, into Liberty &amp; Joy, they ſeemed to themſelves <hi>like them that dream.</hi> Their former <hi>Diſtreſs</hi> was ſo recent in every one's Memory, and had been ſo long &amp; heavy upon them, that they ſtill ſeem'd to feel it, and could hardly realize their actual Recovery out of it. Their preſent <hi>Enlargement</hi> was ſo ſudden, was attended with ſuch wonderful Circumſtances, and promiſed ſuch glorious Conſequences, ſuperiour to their higheſt and moſt ſanguine Expectations, that they were aſtoniſh'd at it, and could ſcarce "believe it for Joy." As it is ſtory'd of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> when miraculouſly deliver'd out of his Impriſonment, "He wiſt not that it was <hi>true,</hi> which was done by the Angel; but thought he ſaw a <hi>Viſion</hi>": ſo in the preſent Caſe, the People of God, marvellouſly reſcued from the Oppreſſion of the Enemy, and reſtored to glorious Liberty, ſay of themſelves, "We were like them that <hi>dream</hi>". They were even loſt in a pleaſing Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:008599_0005_102F955A3A8DCAB8"/>
and Amazement, to find their Mourning turned to <hi>Laughter</hi> ſo unexpectedly, and joyful Songs ſo ſuddenly ſucceeding their Tears and Groans. Such a Revolution ſeem'd almoſt incredible to them.</p>
            <p>The very <hi>Pagans</hi> round about them were alarm'd, and ſtruck with Surprize, to obſerve what Wonders the God of Iſrael had wrought for his Favourite-Nation. "Then ſaid they among the <hi>Heathen,</hi> The LORD hath done great Things for them". Such uncommon Events, and of ſo favourable an Aſpect, had Divine Providence effected in behalf of his People, that they became the Topic of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation every where; the ſtriking News apace flew abroad, and ſpread univerſal Surprize. The Heathen themſelves were not inſenſible of a Divine Interpoſition in this Affair; but ſaw and confeſs'd the Hand of the LORD working Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the Iſraelites. How much ſoever they hated the <hi>Jews,</hi> they were convinced, and could not but own, the LORD their GOD had ſignally appeared on their Side, and wrought Wonders for their Relief and Welfair.—Beſure, the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves were conſcious of this; and while their <hi>Pagan</hi> Neighbours made theſe Providential Wonders the Subject of common Talk only, the <hi>Jews</hi> acting in Character, in a juſt Correſpondence with their profeſs'd Attachment to the Service of the God of Heaven, and in Order properly to ſignify their Gratitude, as became a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple laid under ſuch diſtinguiſhing Obligations, made theſe Things the Matter of their <hi>devotional</hi> Acknowledgments; and in a Way of Addreſs to the GOD of Iſrael, they ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the grateful Confeſſion in our Text, "The LORD hath done great Things for us: whereof we are glad".</p>
            <p>The <hi>Heathen,</hi> that ſaw or heard of the ſtupendous Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of Providence which gave ſuch <hi>Gladneſs</hi> to the Jews, might be affected in a Way of Surprize: but ſtill might conceive little <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> and offer no Thanks to God, on the Occaſion; nay rather, from the Power of Prejudice and Superſtition, might give Way to invidious and indignant Paſſions, when they view'd theſe aſtoniſhing Events as the Products of a ſpecial Divine Agency in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:008599_0006_102F955C0DBB6D38"/>
of them who were Partakers of the Benefit; when they conſider'd theſe Wonders as wrought, not by any of their own gods, but by the GOD of the <hi>Jews,</hi> whom, in his ſuper-eminent Character of "the only living and true God, the Holy One of Iſrael", they were truly Haters of; and when they conſider'd the ſame as wrought in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of a Nation, whom, in their Character of "a holy Nation, and the peculiar People of the moſt High", the <hi>Heathen</hi> rather maligned and deſpiſed. However, while others might be vexed at theſe Things, and might envy the Jews, or at beſt only ſtand amazed at theſe great Events, the obliged People themſelves, conſcious of their being highly favoured of the Lord, took <hi>Pleaſure</hi> therein, and devoutly confeſſed GOD the Author of them; ſaying, "The LORD hath done great Things for us: whereof we are <hi>glad</hi>".</p>
            <p>As Chearfulneſs is uſually expreſs'd by Songs, and Thankſgiving is the proper Language of Joy, on the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of Divine Benefits, they expreſſed the <hi>Gladneſs</hi> of their Hearts in an Addreſs of <hi>Thanks,</hi> a Hymn of <hi>Praiſe;</hi> which is handed down to us in the inſpired Records. It is one of the "Songs of Zion", in which the Words of our Text occur. The People of God had been "ſowing in Tears", but were now "reaping in Joy": And their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Rejoycing</hi> was "after a godly ſort", as we may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume their antecedent <hi>Sorrowing</hi> had been. They "walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mournfully before the Lord", while "their Harps hung on the Willows", untuned to "ſing the Lord's Song" in their ſuffering State. But upon their Deliverance they "awaked up their Glory, and ſang, and gave Praiſe". They now "rejoyced before the Lord", and paid their grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Honours to the God of their Salvation. "Then (ſay they) was our Mouth filled with <hi>Laughter,</hi> and our Tongue with <hi>Singing</hi>". It is a Dictate of Reaſon, as well as a Precept of Revelation, "Is any <hi>merry?</hi> let him <hi>ſing Pſalms</hi>". This is univerſally the Temper and Tendency of devout Souls. They are diſpoſed to "ſanctify the Name of God" on all Occaſions of Mirth. Not reſting in <hi>Laughter,</hi> in natural and civil Merriment, the Children
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:008599_0007_102F955F3AE312C0"/>
of Zion have their devotional <hi>Singing.</hi> Not contented with entertaining one another, by ſinging Ballads or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſing Poems among themſelves, on the joyful Themes in View, they addreſs Heaven with ſacred "Pſalms, Hymns, and ſpiritual Songs, ſinging and making Melody in their Hearts to the LORD", in Proportion as they are "filled with the Spirit." So <hi>Mary</hi> ſaid, "My Soul doth <hi>magnify</hi> the Lord, and my Spirit hath <hi>rejoyced</hi> in God my Saviour."—And ſurely, it muſt be granted, this is <hi>our</hi> reaſonable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. "For it is good, to ſing Praiſes unto our God: for it is pleaſant, and Praiſe is comely".</p>
            <p>Verily "<hi>every Day</hi> we ſhould bleſs the Lord," and "rejoice in <hi>every good Thing</hi> which the Lord our God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoweth on us". But when he doeth great Things for us, as theſe furniſh us with Matter of exceeding Joy, ſo they ſhould proportionably warm our Hearts, and fill our Mouths with Praiſe; introducing the livelieſt Accents and moſt chearful Notes into our Songs of Joy, while extolling Him who is great and greatly to be praiſed. When God exalteth the Horn of his People, when he beautify's them with Salvation, crowns them with Loving-kindneſs, and marvellouſly operates in his Providence for their Safety and Welfair, he then expects they be abundantly joyful in Glory, and ſing aloud the high Praiſes of their Divine Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor. On ſuch Occaſions, very eminently, the Call from Heaven is in thoſe emphatical Strains—"Praiſe ye the Lord. Sing unto the Lord a new Song, and his Praiſe in the Congregation of Saints. Let Iſrael rejoyce in Him that made him: let the Children of Zion be joyful in their King.—"Praiſe him for his mighty Acts: praiſe him according to his excellent Greatneſs.—Declare his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings among the People; make mention that his Name is exalted. Sing unto the Lord; for he hath done excellent Things: be it known in all the Earth. Shout, thou Inhabitant of Zion; for great is the Holy One of Iſrael in the midſt of thee.—O clap Hands, all ye People; ſhout unto God with the Voice of Triumph. Sing Praiſes to God, ſing Praiſes. For God is King of all the Earth: ſing ye Praiſes with Underſtanding. The Shields of the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:008599_0008_102F9560D8BD1588"/>
Earth belong unto God: He is greatly exalted.—"Sing ye to the Lord; for he hath triumphed gloriouſly.—Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe ye Greatneſs unto God.—"O ſing unto the Lord a new Song: for he hath done marvellous Things; his right Hand, and his holy Arm hath gotten him the Victory.—"Sing unto the Lord with the Voice of a Pſalm: make a joyful Noiſe before the Lord, the King.—"Let Mount Zion rejoyce; let the Daughters of Judah be glad, becauſe of his Judgments.—"O give Thanks to Him who alone doeth great Wonders. O give Thanks unto the God of Heaven.—"Sing unto the Lord with Thankſgiving. Praiſe the Lord, O Jeruſalem: praiſe thy God, O Zion."—In this pathetic Language, and with much Re-iteration, the Scriptures urge the Duty of Praiſe, joyful Praiſe, and fervent Thankſgiving, to Him whoſe Name alone is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, and who doeth excellent Things, great and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous Things, without Number.</p>
            <p>In Conformity to theſe Divine Injunctions, that is the Saint's Diſpoſition and Reſolution, and his Heart's Deſire, in the Language of the holy Pſalmiſt—"Thou, Lord, haſt made me glad through thy Work: I will triumph in the Works of thy Hands. O Lord, how great are thy Works!—"I will extol thee, my God, O King; and I will bleſs thy Name for ever and ever. I will ſpeak of the glorious Honour of thy Majeſty, and of thy wondrous Works. My Mouth ſhall ſpeak the Praiſe of the Lord: and let all Fleſh bleſs his holy Name for ever and ever."—</p>
            <p>Not ſatisfy'd with his own perſonal Thankſgivings and Praiſes, or with thoſe of the happy <hi>Few,</hi> like-minded with himſelf, the good Man (with the Spirit of the Royal Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt) wiſhes, that "all the Earth" may ſing unto the Lord; that "all the Kindreds of the People" may give unto the Lord the Glory due to his Name; that "the People" may praiſe him, that "all the People" may praiſe him; that "every one that hath Breath" may praiſe the Name of the Lord.—</p>
            <p>Not only does he ſtir up his own Soul, and all that is within him, to bleſs the Lord; but conſcious of his Ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality to the heavenly Buſineſs, he calls in Help, and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:008599_0009_102F956279797488"/>
would fain aſſociate others with himſelf herein. He would have all unite their Praiſes with his, to honour God more ſuitably to his Greatneſs, and to the Worthineſs of the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, on receiving of great and common Salvations, great and general Benefits. The Man who is animated with the Pſalmiſt's excellent Spirit, is ready to reſound and echo to thoſe his pious and affectionate Exhortations—"O mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify the Lord with me, and let us exalt his Name toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.—"O come, let us ſing unto the Lord: let us make a joyful Noiſe to the Rock of our Salvation. Let us come before his Preſence with Thankſgiving and make a joyful Noiſe unto Him with Pſalms. For the Lord is a great God, and a great King above all gods.—"Bleſs the Lord, O houſe of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> bleſs the Lord, O houſe of <hi>Aaron;</hi> bleſs the Lord, O houſe of <hi>Levi;</hi> ye that fear the Lord, bleſs the Lord—"Kings of the Earth; and all people; Princes, and all Judges of the Earth; both young Men and Maidens, old Men, and Children; let them praiſe the Name of the Lord."—This now I think, muſt be the Voice of every pious Obſerver of the Times, and Lover of Zion, concurrent with the Voice of God in his Word and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, reſpecting our Nation and Land at this Day. For, with the ſtricteſt Propriety and upon the juſteſt Grounds, we may adopt the Language of our <hi>Text</hi> (and may we all, by a ſpecial Influence from the Spirit of Chriſt, unite in an Acknowledgement ſo appoſite to our Caſe, with the like Fervor of Devotion, Gratitude and holy Triumph, as did the Church that firſt made this exulting Speech!) <hi>The</hi> LORD <hi>hath done great Things for us:</hi> whereof <hi>we are glad.</hi>

            <p>What I have chiefly in View at preſent, is a brief Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognition of ſome remarkable Events, that have been plainly owing to the kind Interpoſition of a Divine Hand, for our Safety and Welfair: which alone may ſufficiently

evidence the LORD's having done <hi>great Things</hi> for us, and which loudly beſpeak a thankful Commemoration.</p>
            <p>Certainly GREAT BRITAIN is that happy Iſland, where many the moſt notable Tranſactions of a favourable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence have been ſeen, both in former and later Ages. To go but a little further back than one or two of the laſt Centuries—Among the memorable Events in Favour of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Nations, now ſo happily connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in one Kingdom, and among the laſting Glories of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> we may very juſtly ſet an Aſteriſm on that capital and leading Inſtance, the REFORMATION. Which was the Kingdom's Deliverance from the Tyranny of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and his deteſtable Enormities; the Church's Purification from Abundance of vile Errors, Idolatries and Superſtitions; the reſtoring of the Holy Bible to common Uſe; the ſpreading of Chriſtian Knowledge, and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of a more ſcriptural Worſhip than <hi>Britain</hi> for Ages before had ever ſeen; and in Conſequence of a Divine Bleſſing on Divine Inſtitutions, the Recovery of Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Souls from Darkneſs to Light, from Bondage to Liberty, and from Death to Life, in a moral and ſpiritual Senſe. A Work this, which muſt needs appear truly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing, if we review it in its Riſe and Beginning; if we trace it in its Progreſs; if we attend to its Conſequences and Effects; if we reflect, how it has been guarded and watched over by a ſpecial Providence, and carry'd ſafe thro' many a dangerous Criſis; how it has been ſupported againſt the moſt powerful Efforts of the combined Forces of Earth and Hell in Oppoſition to it; how it has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, when ſometimes fallen into Decay and Languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and even when threatned with utter Ruin, has been renewed and re-eſtabliſhed, if not further advanced, by ſome happy and ſeaſonable, but unexpected Turn of Affairs, in which have appeared very plain Signatures of a Divine Interpoſition. And thô the Reformation, ſo ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully begun, and ſo long ſubſiſting, has never been proſecuted to ſuch a Degree of Perfection, as to leave no Room for future Improvements and Refinements, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Scripture-Rule; yet was it, even from its firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:008599_0013_102F9571C4A018E8"/>
and in its loweſt State, ſuch a Wonder of Mercy to <hi>Britain,</hi> as deſerves to be had in everlaſting Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and juſtly claims a very thankful Mention when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we are thus in the ſolemn Aſſembly commemorating the great and manifold Mercies of God towards us.</p>
            <p>The ſhort Reign of that illuſtrious young Prince (our engliſh <hi>Joſiah</hi>) King EDWARD the ſixth, who ſtood at the Head of the Reformation in <hi>England,</hi> truly meriting his hereditary Title "the Defender of the Faith", and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving himſelf the Patron of pure Religion, as well as a conſpicuous Example of Royal Virtue and early Piety; his ſhort Reign, I ſay, if we had Leaſure to take a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular View of it, would preſent us with ſome of the moſt admirable Scenes of Providence, and entertain us with a pleaſing Variety of great Things done for the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Iſrael, eſpecially in the Conduct and Succeſs of that glorious En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, the Reformation, then ſo happily in Purſuit.</p>
            <p>And when, upon the Demiſe of that incomparable Royal Reformer, a <hi>Popiſh Queen,</hi> the infamous MARY, ſucceeded to the Crown, who ſet her ſelf to ruin the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Intereſt, and ſoon prevailed to reduce Things into the old Channel of Corruption; reviving the Hereſies and Idolatries, that had been exploded and purged away; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting Majeſty by an abject Submiſſion to a foreign Yoke, and reconciling her Court and Realm to his offended Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Rome;</hi> but kindling the Flames of Perſecution againſt the Puritan Reformers, and purſuing with Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance all ſuch as were brave and honeſt enough not to ſtrike in with her impious and tyrannous Meaſures; which drove great Numbers of her beſt Subjects into Exile, impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd Multitudes, ruin'd many a fair Eſtate, and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed many a precious Life;—O what a merciful Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Providence was it, by the <hi>Queen'</hi>s Deceaſe, to put a quick Period to her bloody Reign, and ſo to the moſt ſhocking Scenes of Horror!</p>
            <p>How admirable too was the Kindneſs of Heaven in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving at the ſame time a <hi>Proteſtant Princeſs,</hi> that illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:008599_0014_102F9577A5A6C370"/>
ELISABETH, for the Succeſſor, and haſtening her Advancement to the Throne! Which brought on a bleſſed Revolution in Politicks, and put a new Face upon religious Affairs; once more broke off the Realm from its Subjection to the See of <hi>Rome;</hi> purged the Church from thoſe groſſer Superſtitions in Worſhip, it had relapſed into; reſtored Truth in Doctrine; called home many famous Lights of the Reformation from foreign Parts, to which they had retired for Liberty of Conſcience, and for the Safety of their Perſons; and in ſhort, gave a freſh Revival to the Hopes of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, at a Juncture when all ſeem'd to be loſt.—How great, moreover, was the Goodneſs of God in diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this <hi>Proteſtant Queen,</hi> not only by endowing her with ſuperior Abilities for Government and War, but by giving her Length of Days; and ſo, prolonging her Reign (a Reign proſperous and full of Glory, tho' in ſome Reſpects not without its Clouds) to the firmer Eſtabliſhment of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion at Home, and its greater Security abroad! For <hi>Britain</hi> was then the common Aſylum of Proteſtant Refugees; and truly the Bulwark of the Proteſtant Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt.—In fine here, How marvellous was the Divine Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance for <hi>Britain,</hi> in the total Diſſipation and Deſtruction of the <hi>Spaniſh Armada,</hi> by a terrible Storm; when at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting an Invaſion, and threatning to carry all before it! That vaſtly numerous and powerful <hi>Fleet,</hi> which boaſted it ſelf <hi>invincible,</hi> and ſeem'd ſuperior to all Oppoſition; which therefore, had it not met with the ſignal Blaſts of a vindictive and reſiſting Providence, might have ſucceeded in its dreadful Errand, the ſubduing the Queen and her Realm to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Yoke; and ſo, might have been the unhappy Means of a triumphant Re-entrance of Popery, and a freſh Perſecution of Proteſtants, if not the utter Extinction of the Proteſtant Religion, in <hi>Britain,</hi> at leaſt.</p>
            <p>The next remarkable Inſtance I ſhall mention of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſing Providence on behalf of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Iſrael, occur'd in the following Reign, that of King JAMES the Firſt; and it was the ſo opportune Diſcovery of that horrid <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> commonly called <hi>Gun-powder Treaſon,</hi> juſt at the critical Moment, when ripe for Execution; which being happily
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:008599_0015_102F957966D45A78"/>
prevented, the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi> were wonderfully reſcued from a ſudden and univerſal Deſtruction by one fatal Stroke; that, had it taken Place, might eventually have proved the Deſtruction of Engliſh Liberty, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Proteſtant Faith, and have brought on new Triumphs of Papal Tyranny and Rage. Great indeed was the Deliverance <hi>Britain</hi> now receiv'd.</p>
            <p>In the Reign of King CHARLES the Firſt, when, under the too prevalent Influence of a <hi>Popiſh Queen,</hi> and the Counſels of a <hi>Popiſhly affected</hi> Party about the Court, ſuch large Strides were taken towards arbitrary Power, and when the Nation was groaning under ſuch Stretches and Abuſes of the Prerogative, and ſuch Incurſions upon Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and Property, to which violent and illegal Meaſures all the Calamities of that impolitic and improſperous Reign ſeem to have been radically &amp; primarily owing; what a ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Interpoſition of Divine Providence on behalf of a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſo injured and threatned with Ruin, was to be ſeen in that ſeaſonable and noble Stand, a ſpirited and free, but loyal <hi>Parliament</hi> made, in Support of civil Right, and for the Redreſs of national Grievances! And was there not viſibly the Hand of God in ſuch a general Coaleſcence and firm U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of all Ranks of People, Gentry and Commonalty, on the Side of the Oppoſition! And indeed it ſeems to have been the natural Right of the People, if not their indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable Duty, to adhere to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> at leaſt ſo long as they acted in Character, as authorized Guardians of the Community, as the public Conſervators of their legal Rights and civil Liberties, and went into none but true Patriotic Meaſures. Nor can I but ſuppoſe, the heroic <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary</hi> Stand then made, has had laſting good Effects, and <hi>Britain</hi> is reaping Advantages from it to this very Day.—In Addition to the civil Oppreſſions of that inglorious Reign, there were <hi>eccleſiaſtical</hi> Impoſitions, and in Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence hereof, violent Proſecutions of the <hi>Non-conforming</hi> Clergy (or Proteſtant <hi>Diſſenting</hi> Miniſters) which were the Means of driving Thouſands of the King's beſt Subjects over to theſe remote Regions of <hi>America,</hi> in View of a ſecure Retreat from the angry Storm; and ſo prov'd the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:008599_0016_102F957AF1AC7228"/>
unexpected Occaſion of ſome bleſſed Events, at once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging the Kingdom of CHRIST, and extending the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions of <hi>Britain,</hi> to the great Advancement of its Wealth, Strength and Glory, as at this Day.—And what is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful to reflect on, at the ſame Time <hi>the King's Heart,</hi> by the good Hand of God, was bowed to favour theſe his emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant Subjects with his <hi>Letters Patent,</hi> or <hi>Royal Charters,</hi> planning a good civil Government for them, and vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafing them ample Powers, Privileges, Immunities &amp; Rights; which have contributed ſignally to the Preſervation, Growth and Flouriſhing of the <hi>New-England</hi> Colonies, from whence a Series of vaſt Advantages and Benefits have been derived to the Mother-Kingdom.—The unhappy civil <hi>Wars,</hi> that ſo long ſubſiſted, between the King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and which were over-ruled in Providence to an amazing Iſſue; yet ſeem to have laid the Foundation for Conſequences, that not a little affected the Weal of the Nation, and have been ſubſervient to its Safety and Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity.—The <hi>tragical</hi> Fate of that unhappy KING has left a ſtanding Monument of the Abſurdity and Danger there is in a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Prince's giving Ear to <hi>Popiſh</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and the Folly of riſking his Crown by ſtraining his Prerogative, or neglecting his Parliament, or deſpiſing the Populace.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Interregnum</hi> that follow'd, however ſome Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances attending it, or ſome of its Tranſactions, might caſt a Gloom over it, yet I think, was not without a Mixture of ſuch Events in Providence, in that Day, as conſpired to advance the Glory and Felicity of <hi>Britain,</hi> and ſuch as may juſtly ſtrike the calm unprejudiced Reflector with Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration. How ſignally did the interpoſing Hand of God appear, in that, notwithſtanding the long-continued Rage of an inteſtine War, which ſo commonly corrupts the Manners of a People, there ſhould be ſuch Remains, yea, a viſible Increaſe, of Sobriety and Virtue in the Nation! That notwithſtanding ſuch Emulations and Claſhings among a Variety of Parties, and ſuch Changes in the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of civil Government, there ſhould be ſo much good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der maintained, and the Courſe of Juſtice ſo well preſerved!
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:008599_0017_102F957C87DDB7B8"/>
In ſhort, that there ſhould ſtill be ſo much of the Face of a Kingdom kept up, and ſo many Tokens of a flouriſhing Nation; ſuch a Degree of national Strength, of national Fame, and Influence abroad—and above all, ſuch an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Growth in Chriſtian Knowledge, and ſo many Signs of a proſperous State of Religion! How marvellous the Goodneſs of God to <hi>Britain,</hi> in not ſuffering either Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy or Tyranny at any Time to be its Ruin, but over-ruling the Miſchiefs of both to produce good Effects in the Iſſue!</p>
            <p>When the Reſtoration of Monarchy in the Perſon of King CHARLES the Second came on, it is obſervable, though together with this there was a Reſtoration of arbitrary Meaſures of Government, though a Deluge of Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Diſorders broke in with it, and though the Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Proteſtant Diſſenters was renewed and carried on with a high Hand, yet by a Divine over-ruling Providence Good was brought out of Evil, and <hi>Britain'</hi>s Happineſs the more advanced, and better ſecured, in the Event. For Inſtance, the Turning ſuch a Multitude of worthy <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates</hi> out of their Offices, becauſe they did not ſee Light to make ſolemn Renunciation of an important political <hi>Principle,</hi> which if ſincerely and univerſally <hi>abhorred,</hi> and the Contrary eſpouſed, there had no Place been left for ſuch a glorious Event as the <hi>Revolution,</hi> or the <hi>Proteſtant Succeſſion,</hi>—this doubtleſs had its Influence to confirm thoſe Gentlemen in their Attachment to <hi>Britiſh</hi> Liberty, and by their Example to diffuſe and perpetuate a generous Warmth in the ſame righteous Cauſe; which ſerved to pave the Way for thoſe <hi>glorious Events;</hi> that have been the effectual Means of its Recovery and Eſtabliſhment.—So, the Silencing ſuch a large Body of <hi>Nonconformiſt Miniſters,</hi> perhaps as uſeful and truly valuable a Sett of Goſpel-Preachers as any Nation was ever bleſs'd with, who were thruſt out of their Livings, driven into Corners, and miſerably harraſſed with penal Laws.—this eventually turned to the Honor of thoſe perſecuted Diſſenters, and the greater Credit of their Cauſe, as theſe hard Meaſures afforded them an Opportunity to ſignalize their Integrity,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:008599_0018_102F957E55753D88"/>
and give glorious Proofs of the Purity of their Zeal for a further Reformation.—The <hi>People</hi> alſo, who had been ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely engaged in the ſame Cauſe, became naturally now but the more attach'd to this perſecuted Cauſe, and to its ſuffering Patrons: and a growing Fervour of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ove to the Divine Word and Ordinances, in their purer Adminiſtration, eaſily drew them into private Aſſemblies for the Enjoyment of theſe bleſſed Privileges, by Means whereof the <hi>Diſſenting Intereſt</hi> was kept up. Nor could all the Oppoſition made ever prevail to ſuppreſs it: but rather ſerved to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and promote it; and in the final Reſult, this turned to the Eſtabliſhment and Security of the <hi>Diſſenting Intereſt,</hi> by being the Occaſion of bringing on a <hi>Legal Toleration,</hi> in a ſubſequent Reign; and thus, indeed, it turned in the Iſſue to the ſtrengthning of the <hi>Proteſtant Intereſt</hi> in general, by enforcing the Principles of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi> and ſtrengthning the Foundations on which it ſtands.—On the whole, the Conduct of Divine Providence in this Affair, I think, is greatly to be admired; and the Goodneſs of God in thus over-ruling the moſt adverſe Meaſures, rather to the Advantage of the noble Cauſe of civil Liberty and pure Religion.<note n="*" place="bottom">N.B. Some of the foregoing Reflexions were either for Brevity omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in delivering my Sermon, or elſe eſcaped me in the haſty compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it. But I could not avoid inſerting them in my Tranſcript for the Preſs, without ſome Injuſtice to the Subject, and perhaps as much to my ſelf.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Moſt of theſe Remarks are equally applicable to the Caſe as it ſtood in the next Reign, that of King JAMES the Second. I ſhall therefore only obſerve here in general, that as he was in Principle a zealous <hi>Papiſt,</hi> he was bent on the Reſtoring of Popery in <hi>Britain,</hi> but was ſtrangely infatuated in his Counſels, and left of God to purſue ſuch Meaſures, relative both to Church and State, as only ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to defeat his Intentions and fruſtrate his Hopes. For Inſtance, while he ſtrove, by various Methods, by Frowns and Flatteries, by Perſecutions, by illegal Diſpenſations &amp;c. to widen the Differences between his <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Subjects, with Reference to their religious Diſputes in ſpecial, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

gratifying one Party, and at other times courting the other, and all with an Aim to weaken the common Cauſe, theſe Managements only ſerved to draw their Attention to the common Danger, to drive the contending Parties nearer together, to make them willing to come to a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per among themſelves, and unite their Efforts for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Safety. And ſuch at length was the Union of the whole Nation in Oppoſition to the KING's Religion and Politicks, that an Invitation was ſent to that celebrated General and Politician, the PRINCE of <hi>Orange</hi> (the King's Son in Law) to come over to their Help, for the Redreſs of Grievances, the Reſcue of civil Liberty, and Security of the Proteſtant Intereſt. A Conduct highly becoming a free People, juſtifiable by the great Law of Self-Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in my Views of it, ſo near a-kin to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Oppoſition to King CHARLES the Firſt, that I know not how any can conſiſtently approve the one and condemn the other. This Precedent may ſuffice forever to ſilence all Pleas for indefeaſible hereditary Right, Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtance and paſſive Obedience; which have ſometimes made ſuch a Noiſe, but now ſeem happily laid aſleep. This Conduct, at leaſt, has declared the general Senſe of the Nation, and left a notable Teſtimony to the Cauſe of civil Liberty, and the Proteſtant Religion. In this a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Hand of God is to be ſeen and acknowledged.—This prepared the Way for the Nation's Deliverance. And a bleſſed Deliverance it was, when King JAMES, either through Conſciouſneſs of Guilt, or through Cowardize, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Apprehenſion of approaching Danger, made his <hi>Exit</hi> (as inglorious a one perhaps as that of his Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, though not in the ſame Manner) firſt abdicating his Crown, and then forſaking his Kingdom, and going into a kind of voluntary Exile. By which Means a civil War was happily prevented; and hereby, purſuant to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Right, the Nation was at Liberty to fill the vacant Throne by Election of a Succeſſor.</p>
            <p>And upon whom ſhould the Eyes of the Nation more naturally be turn'd, than their glorious Deliverer, who ſtood ſo nearly related to the Throne, eſpecially by his
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:008599_0020_102F958902DDFE58"/>
Conſort, the eldeſt Princeſs of the Blood? This wiſe and great <hi>Prince</hi> and his moſt amiable <hi>Conſort</hi> were accordingly by the united Voice of the Lords and Commons, with the general Conſent, conſtituted KING and QUEEN.—A ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing <hi>Revolution</hi> this, attended with ſuch Circumſtances, and follow'd with ſuch Conſequences, as loudly ſpeak it a Wonder of Mercy to <hi>Britain,</hi> and owing to a ſpecial In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition of Divine Providence!—This was an Event fruitful of abundant Happineſs and Glory to the Nation: particularly, in the Eſtabliſhment of <hi>civil Liberty,</hi> and Proviſion for the Security of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> by a Parliamentary Settlement of the <hi>Succeſſion</hi> to the Crown in the Proteſtant Royal Line; hereby greatly ſuperadding to the Security and Strength given to both by the then preſent, juſt, mild, Proteſtant Reign. For King WIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIAM's great and generous Soul, not ſatisfy'd with having reſcu'd <hi>Britain</hi> out of the Hands of it's Enemies, nor with making it happy, by ſecuring it's Religion and Liberty, during his own Reign, look'd forward, even to diſtant Futurity, and ſtudy'd how to perpetuate the ſame Happineſs in all following Reigns. As a Medium to this bleſſed Purpoſe, God put it into the King's Heart, to get the Crown legally entail'd, in ſuch a Manner, that <hi>Britain</hi> might hope for a glorious Race of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Princes,</hi> to ſway the Sceptre in Righteouſneſs and in Mercy.—And the Royal Favour, not reſtrain'd by Bigotry to any one Sett of the King's Proteſtant Subjects, but conducted by an impartial View to the public Good, procured an Act of Parliament to eſtabliſh a Toleration and Allowance of <hi>Proteſtant Diſſenters;</hi> to their great Relief and Quiet, as well as to the greater Advantage and firmer Security of the common Cauſe, wherein all, whoſe Hearts are truly Proteſtant, are conſtantly united.—However, while he eſteem'd it his Glory to rule over a free People, and conſulted the general Good in allowing a reaſonable Liberty to all his loyal Subjects; yet, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a true Father, he at the ſame time took Care to fence them about with wholeſome Laws, for the Security of good Manners, and would indulge none in a wicked Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs. His Heart appear'd warmly engaged in the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:008599_0021_102F958A90E50320"/>
noble Deſign of exalting the National Character, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the Genius of his People, by rectifying and raiſing their Morals. And it is not the leaſt among the Glories of his auſpicious Reign, that thoſe excellent "Societies for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of Manners" had their Riſe in it, and flouriſhed under his powerful Patronage.—Nor was his Royal Care limited to the Shores of <hi>Britain,</hi> but extended it ſelf to the remoteſt <hi>Britiſh</hi> Factories and Plantations beyond Sea. As a Father mindful of his Children abſent, the King ſought the Weal of his Proteſtant Subjects abroad, as well as at home, and was equally concerned to ſecure their Religion and Liberty. Where any of them were in Hazard of being ſeduced to <hi>Popery,</hi> and ſo of being drawn into Slavery, he was in Care to have them provided with a good Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; and where any Factory or Settlement had not Strength enough within it ſelf to procure and maintain the Miniſtry of the Word, he took Care to make Proviſion for their Aſſiſtance; and even for the Support of Proteſtant Miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to proſelyte the <hi>Heathen</hi> to Chriſtianity. On ſuch heroic Deſigns, and not on any little narrow Party. Views, was founded that Royal Inſtitution of the "Society for propagating the Goſpel in foreign Parts".—[Nor can I believe, it ever entred into the KING's generous Heart, that the Charities given on this noble Foundation, ſhould be principally applied to ſerve the Intention of reclaiming <hi>Proteſtant Diſſenters</hi> to the Epiſcopal Communion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at home or abroad. If ſuch Application of theſe Charities be juſtifiable in the latter Caſe, why not alſo in the former? Were the Experiment made of ſuch an Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>at Home,</hi> perhaps it might have the good Effect, to put the Application <hi>Abroad</hi> under a different Direction. But this by the Way.]—I go on to obſerve, how the benign Influences of the Royal Favour and Juſtice reach'd to us in theſe <hi>New-England</hi> Colonies. The King's loyal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects here, in the laſt preceeding Reigns, had been not only deprived of their invaluable Charter-Privileges, but cruelly harraſſed and oppreſſed by various deſpotic Meaſures, and in imminent Danger of loſing both their Religion &amp; Liberty. A Criſis, that no true Friend of either can review without ſome painful Feelings! But thrô the Mercy of an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:008599_0022_102F958C2238DD40"/>
Providence, theſe Colonies were delivered from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending Ruin, by Means of the glorious Revolution, and the happy Acceſſion of King WILLIAM to the Throne: who of his Royal Grace renewed or continued their Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and with a Paternal Pleaſure ſaw them caſed of their Grievances, and reſtored to a ſecure and proſperous State. Now were their Complaints turned into Songs, and they were <hi>like unto them that dream.</hi> They now found Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and Solace, in the undiſturbed Poſſeſſion of Liberty and Property, of their Laws, their civil Rights, and their religious Privileges; partaking largely in the National Happineſs, under the wiſe, the equal, the Proteſtant Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of King WILLIAM, whoſe Memory is bleſſed: And it may fitly be ſubjoined here, on whoſe Royal Head (even after the Loſs of his excellent Partner in the Throne) ſtill the Crown ſat ſafe and flouriſhing, to the Joy of his loyal Subjects, both at home and abroad. But his Enemies were covered with Shame, by finding themſelves fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in all their Attempts (whether in the Methods of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection and Invaſion, or of Aſſaſſination and Murder) to wreſt the Sceptre out of his Royal Hand, in order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place a fugitive and abjured King in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Throne. For it is very remarkable, how a gracious Providence watch'd over the Deliverer of the Nation, and the Shield of its Liberty, civil and ſacred; to defend his Perſon, to ſupport his Throne, and to crown his Reign with Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Fame, to the great Glory and Happineſs of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> and its Dependences.—Theſe ſurely are Wonders of interpoſing Mercy, never to be forgotten; ſuch as muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways make a diſtinguiſhing Figure in the Engliſh Story; and well deſerve a grateful Mention on this Occaſion.</p>
            <p>Nor was Queen ANNE's Reign, who next ſucceeded to the Crown, without thoſe Inſtances of a benevolent over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling Providence in Favour of <hi>Britain</hi> and its Colonies, that merit our grateful Reflexions. The peaceable Acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Princeſs to the Throne, upon the Foot of the late Revolution-Settlement of the Succeſſion, happily delivered the Kingdom at preſent from the painful Apprehenſion of a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Succeſſor. The Security of her
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:008599_0023_102F95920C3A2468"/>
Perſon, and the Support of the Proteſtant Succeſſion as then by Law eſtabliſhed, being the Objects of public At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and the common Care; her Reign likewiſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencing with a Variety of great Bleſſings and Glories, and proceeding for a while with a progreſſive Proſperity and very promiſing Appearances,—theſe Circumſtances gave further Encouragements to the Friends of the Proteſtant Succeſſion, and new Checks to the Hopes of its Enemies. It muſt be acknowledg'd, this female Reign was for a Courſe of Years very much ſignaliz'd and honoured in Providence. It was highly dignify'd in particular, by a juſt, a mild, a wiſe Adminiſtration of civil Government; by a Parliamentary Confirmation of the Revolution-Entail of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Crown; by a Ratification of the legal Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance or Toleration of Proteſtant Diſſenters; by the Union of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> in one common Kingdom, to the ſtrengthning their common Intereſts, in reſpect of civil Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and the Proteſtant Religion; by the Reduction of <hi>Port-Royal</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> which open'd the way for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt and Recovery of all <hi>Nova-Scotia;</hi>—in fine, by an almoſt incredible Series of prodigious Victories, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant Succeſſes in War, under the Conduct of that conſummate martial Genius, the <hi>Duke</hi> of MARLBO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ROUGH a General moſt deſervedly of the firſt Character in his Day.—But alas, in Proceſs of Time much of the Glory departed. Several of the laſt Years of this Reign make no very honorable or conſiſtent Figure in its Annals. The <hi>Queen,</hi> thrô ſome unhappy Weakneſs, was tempted to diſcard her old and beſt Servants; and a Change of her Miniſtry brought on a Change of her Meaſures. This Revolution in the public Counſels ſoon produced an Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the State of public Affairs, both at home and abroad. The <hi>Queen</hi> was betray'd into an inglorious Peace; at a Criſis, when her Majeſty's Sword, in the almoſt reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Hand of her brave General, had humbled the Pride of <hi>France,</hi> and "reduced its exorbitant Power nearly to its native Bounds, and had by the <hi>French</hi> King's own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion juſt cut open an Entrance into the very Heart of his Kingdom; which he acknowledg'd would have been
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:008599_0024_102F9599E41CB488"/>
of the moſt fatal Conſequence to him; and, no Doubt, would have for ever ſet us free from any Apprehenſions of his Power," though before ſo very formidable to all <hi>Europe,</hi> and the grand Support of the Pretender to her Majeſty's Crown; whoſe Hopes therefore had been for ever extinguiſhed, had that juſt and neceſſary War with <hi>France</hi> ſtill been proſecuted, with equal Vigour and Succeſs, as it was before the <hi>Queen</hi> was ſeduced to terminate it with an ill-judg'd and diſhonorable Peace: which, if She had long ſurvived it, might have been followed with a dreadful Train of evil Conſequences, both to <hi>Britain</hi> and its Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.—The <hi>Queen</hi> was betray'd into ſome perſecuting Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, relative to her Proteſtant diſſenting Subjects; which, if an interpoſing Providence had not hindred their taking Effect, would have open'd a Fountain of Miſchiefs to them and their Poſterity; and wou'd ſo far, at leaſt, have been an Injury and Diſgrace to the Nation. In a Word, the Plots of a ſtrong and reſtleſs Faction, in Oppoſition to her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Reign, and in Favour of an abjured Popiſh preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, began to produce ſome bad Effects, of a very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Tendency, and even threatned the very worſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtrophe; which I know not how any <hi>Proteſtant</hi> or <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> can reflect on without a ſenſible Pain.—But, in great Mercy to the Kingdom and its Dependencies, GOD, who is the Governor among the Nations, and in whoſe Hand our Breath is, by ſurprizing Means prevented the impend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Evil.—The Hand of Providence, in the ſudden Vaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Throne, and the unexpected general Union in immediately proclaiming the true Succeſſor by Law, made Way for the peaceful Acceſſion of the illuſtrious Houſe of HANOVER to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Crown, in the Perſon of his late Majeſty King GEORGE the Firſt.<note n="†" place="bottom">He was great Grandſon to King JAMES the Firſt; whoſe Daughter ELISABETH, the Conſort of that Proteſtant Elector <hi>Palatine,</hi> whom the Emperor ſtript of his Dominions, was the Mother of SOPHIA, Conſort to the Elector of <hi>Brunſwick</hi> and Duke of <hi>Hanover,</hi> who by her had this Son, King GEORGE I. born <hi>ANNO</hi> 1660, the Year of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second's Reſtoration, So that in that Day a kind Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence was preparing greater and better Things for <hi>Britain,</hi> than the Nation then dream'd of!</note> This at

But, as Iſrael ſang of old, "Bleſſed be the Lord, who hath not given us a Prey to their Teeth. Our Soul is eſcaped as a Bird out of the Snare of the Fowler: the Snare is broken, and we are eſcaped."</p>
            <p>As the Acceſſion of the preſent Royal Family to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Throne was thus at a critical Juncture, that ſpeaks a great Deliverance thereby given us, ſo it was attended with a Coincidence of favorable Circumſtances, and followed with a Train of national Benefits; ſuch as, if review'd in their juſt Light, would open to us very glorious Scenes of Providence, and evidence that God had therein ſhewed his People a Token for Good. What an Increaſe of Strength and Glory muſt it give <hi>Great Britain</hi>—What Weight to its Counſels—What Terror to its Arms—to have a Prince on the Throne, of ſuch ſuperior Wiſdom and Experience, of ſuch diſtinguiſhing Abilities for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and for War, of ſuch extenſive Fame and Influence abroad, and in ſuch high Eſteem at home, equally the Delight of his Friends, and the Dread of his Enemies!—What a Favor to the Nation, that the King brought with him to the Throne a numerous Progeny, which gave the joyful Proſpect of a long Race of Proteſtant Succeſſors to the Crown? And that he had his important Life ſo lengthned out, the more firmly to eſtabliſh the Tranquillity of his Kingdom, and the better to ſecure the Proteſtant Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion; to remove the Fears of its Friends, and daſh the Hopes of its Adverſaries?</p>
            <p>When King GEORGE, the Firſt by a ſudden Death was taken away, while on a Viſit to his <hi>German Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> what a favorable Circumſtance was it, that he left his Royal SON and Heir behind, immediately to take up the Reins of Government; who came to the Crown in maturity of Years, and with improv'd Qualifications for

Government,—and who having obtain'd Help from God, happily remains in the Throne to this Day!</p>
            <p>What Wonders of Mercy to <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Colonies, has GOD wrought from Time to Time in continuing this <hi>Proteſtant Royal Family</hi> in Poſſeſſion of the Throne; in ſecuring it againſt the repeated Invaſions of a <hi>Popiſh Pretender,</hi> abetted and aided by <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Hell;</hi> in ſuppreſſing once and again the Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of an infatuated Faction, enſlaved to the Deluſions of <hi>Popery,</hi> at beſt to the Notions of an <hi>indefeaſible hereditary Right</hi> of Princes, an <hi>uninterrupted Succeſſion</hi> of Biſhops, and the like; which ſometimes put them upon the moſt deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Conſpiracies and Rebellions; but all in vain! Their Counſels have ever been turned into Fooliſhneſs, their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts defeated, the King's Throne eſtabliſhed; &amp; the Hopes of his Enemies ſeem now extinguiſhed, or elſe their Reaſon awaken'd, ſo that at preſent they appear to be among the Quiet in the Land, and the old Diſtinctions of <hi>Tory</hi> and <hi>Whig, High</hi> Church and <hi>Low,</hi> ſeem to be much out of Date, and next to being bury'd in Oblivion.</p>
            <p>The prolonging of his preſent MAJESTY's important Life and Royal Abilities to ſo advanced an Age,—the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of ſo many Branches of the Royal Family,—the excellent Spirit &amp; Talents for Government ſo conſpicuous already in the Heir apparent,—the extraordinary Genius and Application of the prime Miniſter,—the uncommon Degree of Harmony in the great Court of Parliament;—the public Spirit of all Ranks in contributing ſo readily and liberally for the Support of a vigorous War;—the Eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment of a well-regulated Militia, and Revival of a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Spirit at home; the beſt diſciplin'd and brave Troops abroad; the moſt powerful Navy, that gives <hi>Britain,</hi> if not the Sovereignty of the Seas, yet at leaſt a Superiority, that its Enemies feel and own, and that gives it peculiar Advantages, as well to obſtruct and annoy them, as to facilitate its own Maritime Expeditions, to cover its Land-Enterprizes, and to protect its Fiſhery and Trade; the admirable Valour and Conduct of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Fleets and Armies, under the Command of great Generals and
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:008599_0027_102F959ECA2609A8"/>
great Admirals; the Unanimity of their Counſels, and inviolate Union of their military Efforts; and as the happy Fruit hereof, their late very ſignal and almoſt uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Courſe of Succeſſes; their heroic Exploits, both in the Sea and Land-Service; their Triumphs over the Enemy, in all Quarters of the World, wherever the War has reached; the large, the numerous, and very impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Acquiſitions of Territory (beſides the taking of many Fortreſſes and Ships of War) that have gloriouſly added to the Strength, as well as Extent of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Empire, but are ſo many depreſſing and very enfeebling Defalcati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the <hi>Gallic</hi> Dominions, which have perplexed the Counſels and confounded the ambitious Deſigns of <hi>France:</hi> and at the ſame time, what none can but obſerve, &amp; the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my muſt needs envy, the peaceful State of <hi>Britain</hi> within itſelf, its Freedom from Murmurs and Diſcontents, its Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity and Defence againſt hoſtile Invaſions and Depreda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, its few Loſſes by Sea or Land, its comparatively little Loſs of Blood, its extenſive and flouriſhing Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, its Improvement and Succeſs in gainful Huſbandry and in all Kinds of profitable Manufactures; and in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of all, its unrival'd Plenty and Opulence, which enables the Subject with ſuch a Degree of Eaſe to ſupply the manifold Exigences of his Majeſty's Service, and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully bear the Burden of ſo expenſive a War—This is an uncommon Accumulation of glorious Events, a rare Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of felicitating Circumſtances, that can be paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel'd perhaps in no other Kingdom this Day upon Earth. Theſe Things conſpire to reflect a ſuperlative Luſtre on the latter Years of the KING's Reign, and will make them ſhine with an unexampled Glory in the Annals of <hi>Great Britain.</hi>—Well may "the KING joy in God's Strength—"His Glory is great in God's Salvation—"Honour and Majeſty are put upon him—"On him the Crown flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and his Enemies are cloathed with Shame."—He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes GOD to be "his Strength and his Shield, and the Lifter up of his Head"; and calls upon his People by his Royal Example, as well as Proclamations, to give all the Praiſe to God moſt High, "whoſe is the Kingdom, and the Power, the Victory, and the Majeſty."</p>

And ſurely the marvellous Interpoſitions of an all-governing Providence in Favor of <hi>Britain,</hi> whether of former or later Date, appear (by this imperfect Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of them) to have been ſuch as challenge the moſt grateful Acknowledgements to our God; nor are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected on without Admiration, Joy and Praiſe, not only by thoſe reſiding in the Kingdom thus highly favored, but even by us in the Colonies, who, altho' at ſuch a Diſtance, have felt the kindly Influence of theſe national Salvations and Bleſſings.</p>
            <p>But now to come nigher home, I muſt beg your Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, while I briefly remind you of ſome Specialties in Divine Providence, that have a more immediate Aſpect on the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Colonies, and on <hi>New-England</hi> in particular; but which ultimately redound to the Advantage and Glory of <hi>Britain</hi> itſelf.</p>
            <p>"We have heard with our Ears, and our Fathers have told us", what great and good Things have formerly been done in Providence for the Inhabitants of the Villages in this new World, and eſpecially for thoſe in the Parts where we dwell—How God caſt out the Heathen Natives, by antecedent Wars among themſelves, and by various de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying Sickneſſes, "to prepare a Place of Habitation" for the firſt Founders of theſe engliſh Colonies—How he ſifted, as it were, whole Nations, to plant this Land with a right Seed—How he ſtirred up the Spirits of Multitudes (remote and unknown to one another) to emigrate from their native Country, to venture on a tedious and difficult Voyage acroſs the wide <hi>Atlantic,</hi> and come over to the uncultivated Regions of <hi>America,</hi> principally with a View to enjoy, unmoleſted, their Religion and Liberty, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the ſame to their Poſterity—How he raiſed up Friends to aſſiſt and animate them in their pious and heroic En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize—How he laid remarkable Reſtraints upon thoſe who were Enemies to the great Errand, on which our Anceſtors came over into this inhoſpitable Wilderneſs; and ſtruck a viſible Terror on the numerous lawleſs Sava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges around them, who quickly envy'd and maligned theſe

new Gueſts, but for a long Time dared not to hurt or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt them—How "they got not the Land by their own Sword, nor did their own Arm ſave them"—How won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful a Care the Lord their God, "under whoſe Wings they came to truſt," exerciſed over them in their Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs-State; ſcreening them from Dangers, relieving them in Diſtreſſes, ſupplying their Neceſſities, ſometimes very unaccountably, and almoſt miraculouſly—How he "mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply'd both Man and Beaſt," and provided for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing Numbers—How he "prevented his People with the Bleſſings of Goodneſs"; not only granting them great Deliverances, but great poſitive Good; in the Healthineſs of the Climate; in their Strength to labour; in the Produce of their Fields; in the Privileges, Liberties, and Benefits they enjoy'd both of a civil and eccleſiaſtical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, by Virtue of thoſe Royal Charter-Grants they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; in the pious Magiſtracy and the faithful Miniſtry they were favored with; in the College, and Schools, private as well as public for the training up of Youth, which were made the Preſervatives and Nurſeries of uſeful Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and good Manners, and which were long a ſingular Ornament and Characteriſtic of <hi>New-England;</hi>—in the comely Order and Harmony that generally ſubſiſted here, in Church and State, and in the Over-ruling of ſuch Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions as ſometimes happen'd, to a deſirable Iſſue; in the inteſtine Peace and Tranquillity enjoy'd here at a Time when a horrid civil War raged in the Mother-Country, and the Nation were all in Confuſion and Tumult among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;—in the notable Victories obtained over the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Natives, when they proceeded to commit Hoſtilities a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Engliſh; and in the Recovery of their Charter-Liberties, which had been taken away, at a Time of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Shipwrack of Charters, in an arbitrary Reign (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hinted) but were happily reſtored, when thoſe who envy'd them, imagin'd they had fallen Victims to their Malevolence, beyond all Hope of Relief.—In a Word it is wonderful, how our Fathers were enabled to go through the immenſe Fatigues, and ſupport the vaſt Expences of planting, cheriſhing, and defending theſe <hi>New-England</hi> Settlements, and that with little Aſſiſtance from Home, and
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:008599_0030_102F95AB192DF028"/>
no Charge to the Crown.—In theſe and many other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, the firſt Generations of this People experienced very ſignally the Care of an indulgent Providence. "Have I been a Wilderneſs unto Iſrael?" the Lord may now ſay, as to his People of old.</p>
            <p>And "the Goodneſs of God endureth continually". We of the preſent Generation, though "riſen up in our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Stead an Increaſe of ſinful Men", yet have not been forſaken of our Fathers God; but he is ſtill in ſome Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure with us, as he was with them. Though he has not left us altogether unpuniſhed for our growing Degeneracies, which ſo defile and expoſe the Land, yet neither has he left himſelf without a Witneſs, that He remembers the Love of our Eſpouſals, and hath ſtill a Kindneſs for the Poſterity of a People who had ſuffered for Righteouſneſs Sake.—We enjoy to this Day the great Privileges of God's Word and Houſe and Day, of the Miniſtry and Church-Order: nor are without thoſe ſpiritual Bleſſings, which ſhew that God's SPIRIT remaineth among us.—We ſtill enjoy the Benefits of Magiſtracy, good Laws, and civil Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, hedg'd about with our Royal Charters.—We ſtill enjoy the Advantage of Schools, and Means of Education, truly of ineſtimable Conſequence.—Superadded to all, God is cauſing his Goodneſs to paſs before us in a Variety of ſecular Enjoyments, terrene Bleſſings, and temporal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, which are ſo many Evidences of a continuing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential Care for our Safety &amp; Happineſs. Surely, Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is nigh to us; and in ſome deſirable Meaſure, Glory ſtill dwelleth in our Land. God has been crowing theſe latter Years with his Goodneſs, in very remarkable Inſtances, What Years of general Health have we ſeen, in our Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, in our Garriſons, in our Armies, in our Fleets, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thoſe waſting Sickneſſes that might have brought a Cloud on all our Affairs!—What Years of Plenty, what fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Seaſons, what ſuperabundant Harveſts, by the Bleſſing of God upon our extenſive Plantations, furniſhing us for large Exportation, while Enough has been left for a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Home-Conſumption!—What a remarkable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection on our Borders, Eaſt and Weſt, even where they
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:008599_0031_102F95ACA69B4530"/>
were wont ſometimes to get their Bread with the Peril of their Lives! What unmoleſted Roads! What untroubled Fields! What quiet Habitations, almoſt as ſecure as in Days of Peace! (I ſpeak of theſe <hi>Northern</hi> Provinces eſpecially; for it has been ſadly otherwiſe with ſome of the <hi>Southern.</hi>) At the ſame Time, what a Degree of Protection on our Sea-Coaſts, our Fiſhery, and Navigation! [I can't but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice here, thô out of Place, how that formidable naval Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament from <hi>France,</hi> in the laſt War, that came to viſit and annoy theſe parts, was by the Hand of God in Sickneſs and Storm amazingly deſtroyed; &amp; we marvellouſly deliver'd—The Deſign was, Revenge upon <hi>New-England,</hi> for the Reduction of CAPE-BRETON by our <hi>Provincial</hi> Forces.—Events ſo recent, I wonder they did not occur to my Mind before; and ſo great and intereſting, they ought never to be forgotten.] Verily, there has been as it were "a Wall of Fire" round about us.</p>
            <p>And thô in the Courſe of this War, God has ſometimes hid his Face, and not ſeem'd to "go out with our Armies", but ſaw fit to exerciſe and try us greatly, by inactive and fruitleſs Campaigns, by Repulſes, by Defeats, by Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, by Captivations, by Surrenders of our Fortreſſes, &amp;c. inſomuch that many began to deſpair of Succeſs, and upon a ſignal Occaſion not very long ſince, a general Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick run thrô the Country, from an Apprehenſion left the Enemy ſhould finally prevail againſt us, notwithſtanding our boaſted Superiority in Numbers, Skill and Valour: yet at Length we have had our Fears diſſipated; and no Room left for that old Complaint, "The Summer is ended, and we are not ſaved"!</p>
            <p>God hath in his own Time and Way (always the beſt and wiſeſt) returned, and viſited his People; put our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to Confuſion, and brought them down wonderfully. We behold them this Day repel'd from all their perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Encroachments, and his <hi>Britannic</hi> Majeſty's juſt Rights recovered and ſecured; his original View in this <hi>American</hi> War. Not only ſo, but beyond our moſt ſanguine Hopes at the Beginning, we behold his Majeſty's victorious Troops even treading upon the high Places of the Enemy; the Enemy quite ſubdued, and driven out of all their ſtrong
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:008599_0032_102F95AE3251A338"/>
Holds; the'r laſt Fortreſs now delivered up, and their whole Country ſurrendred to the KING of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> in the Perſon of his <hi>General,</hi>—the intrepid, the ſerene, the ſucceſsful AMHERST; that great General, to whom <hi>Louis-burgh</hi> ſurrendred at the Beginning of the Operations of his Majeſty's Arms in this Part of this World; the ſame to whom a Train of important Surrenders have ſince been made; and who now, by compleating the Reduction of all CANADA, has had the Honour to crown the glorious Atchievements of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Sword, and to ſhut up the Scenes of War, in <hi>North-America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In vain had there been repeated Attempts before, to effect what is now ſo happily accompliſhed. Long had it been the common Opinion (CARTHAGO <hi>eſt delenda</hi>) The <hi>American Carthage</hi> muſt be reduced, CANADA muſt be conquer'd: or we could hope for no laſting Quiet in theſe Parts. Long had this been the Object of our At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and the Matter of our Prayers: but judg'd an Event rather to be wiſhed, than hoped for. Yet now at length, through the good Hand of our God upon us, we ſee the happy Day of its Accompliſhment. We hear the joyful News,—not of this or the other <hi>Fortreſs</hi> of the Enemy reduced,—not of this or the other <hi>Town</hi> ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, but of their <hi>whole Country</hi> conquered, conquered by <hi>Britiſh</hi> Arms, and ſubjected to <hi>Britiſh</hi> Government.</p>
            <p>An Acquiſition this, of vaſt Importance to the Intereſt and Influence of <hi>Britain,</hi> and of the laſt Conſequence to the Safety and Happineſs of theſe its <hi>Colonies.</hi>—But after the ingenious Pieces already in your Hands, I need not offer a Word upon this Argument.—It ſeems, under God, "the future Security of our Privileges religious and civil, is put into our Hands", beyond the Reach of Envy; and we now have none to make us afraid.—And if we can find a Heart for ſo good &amp; great an Enterprize, a favorable Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity now preſents for propagating our <hi>Religion &amp; Liberty, civil Government</hi> and <hi>Goſpel-Order,</hi> among our new <hi>Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Subjects,</hi> and our old <hi>Allies.</hi> And if by the Bleſſing of God, they can be brought to taſte the Sweet and feel the good Effects of theſe ineſtimable Privileges, 'tis one happy Conſequence we may hope for, at leaſt, That it will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer

all Remains of Enmity between us, and procure a laſting Friendſhip for the future.—Such a <hi>Conqueſt</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon <hi>This</hi> which we are now celebrating, will make it <hi>doubly</hi> glorious, and add abundantly to the Joy we have on the preſent "glorious Occaſion", thô truly ſo in it ſelf, and perhaps not inferior in Glory to any of the Kind, this Day to be found in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Annals.</p>
            <p>I congratulate my Country upon ſo illuſtrious an Event, ſo felicitous a Concluſion of theſe martial Enterprizes, and upon the joyful Proſpects now before us.</p>
            <p>We join our <hi>Thanks</hi> with thoſe of the <hi>General,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">In the "<hi>Journal</hi> of the Proceedings of the Army under <hi>Gen.</hi> AMHERST", we find this Article among the <hi>Orders,</hi> dated "Camp before MONTREAL, <hi>Sept.</hi> 9" being the Day after the Surrender—<q>The GENERAL fees with infinite <hi>Pleaſure</hi> the Succeſs, that has crowned the indefatigable Efforts of his Majeſty's Troops, and faithful Subjects in <hi>America.</hi>—The three Armies are intituled to the General's <hi>Thanks</hi> on this Occaſion; and he aſſures them, that he will take the firſt Opportunity of acquainting his <hi>Majeſty</hi> with the Zeal and Bravery, which has always been exerted by the Officers and Soldiers, of the <hi>Regular</hi> and <hi>Provincial</hi> Troops, and alſo by his faithful <hi>Indian</hi> Allies.</q>
               </note>—to the brave TROOPS, that have fought our Battles for us, and been otherwiſe Inſtrumental in <hi>doing for us thoſe great Things, whereof we are glad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We owe our <hi>Thanks</hi> to the GENERAL himſelf, who has by his reſpectable Preſence and Example been the very Soul of this deciſive Enterprize, and in his Conduct and Succeſs united ſhines unrivald.</p>
            <p>We owe our <hi>Thanks</hi> to that great Patriotic MINISTER, firſt in the Direction of theſe Affairs, for his unweary'd At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the Intereſt of the Colonies, and his conſummate Care, both in planning theſe Expeditions, and in pointing out the proper Officers to have the Command.</p>
            <p>We owe our <hi>Thanks</hi> to the <hi>Provincial</hi> GOVERNMENTS, that have with ſo much Alacrity and Reſolution exerted themſelves in the moſt zealous Efforts to aſſiſt and promote his Majeſty's Service, on theſe Occaſions.</p>
            <p>We owe our <hi>Thanks</hi> to the Britiſh PARLIAMENT, for their liberal Grants, in Support of his Majeſty's wiſe Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and towards refunding the Expences of the Colonies,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:008599_0034_102F95B8A12371B8"/>
who otherwiſe muſt have ſunk under an immenſe Load of Debt.</p>
            <p>Above all, we owe our humble <hi>Thanks</hi> to his MAJESTY: and with loyal Hearts, full of joyous Gratitude, we <hi>bleſs the King</hi> for his Paternal Goodneſs in ſending ſuch effectual Aids to his <hi>American</hi> Subjects, in our diſtreſſed State, when we ſo needed the Royal Protection; as the Enemy were daily increaſing in their Advantages againſt us, and threatning our Ruin; which is now happily prevented, by the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Turn of Affairs, upon his MAJESTY's gracious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition.</p>
            <p>But ſtill our <hi>Thanks</hi> are not to centre &amp; determine here. No; they muſt riſe above all human Agents, and aſcend to the ſupreme Efficient, the God of Armies, the King of Kings, and the primary Source of every proſperous Event. "The Race is not to the Swift, nor the Battle to the Strong"; but "Victory is of the LORD". It is "through God", that our Forces "have done valiantly". It is God, who hath "trodden down our Enemies". It is God, who hath "given us Reſt", incircling us on all Sides. To the Majeſty of Heaven we are ſupremely indebted, for the glorious Salvations and Succeſſes we are this Day rejoycing in. To God moſt High therefore our humble <hi>Thanks</hi> are ſupremely owing; as indeed the Solemnity of this Day implicitly confeſſeth.</p>
            <p>Now then that "our Heads are lifted up above our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies round about", we ſhould raiſe our wondring Eyes &amp; our thankful Hearts up to God in the Heavens; "offering in his Tabernacle the Sacrifices of Joy"; with joyful Lips ſinging Praiſes to the LORD, who hath done for us all theſe <hi>great Things,</hi> whereof we are <hi>glad;</hi> but the Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereof we once look'd upon as hopeleſs; and for the <hi>one half</hi> or even any ſmall Part whereof, we ſhould have been very thankful, at leaſt very <hi>glad,</hi> ſome few Years ago. A Reflexion this, which may well exalt our Joy, warm our Gratitude, and raiſe every pious &amp; pleaſing Affection to an uncommon Height, while on an uncommon Occaſion we are preſenting our Thanks to the LORD, who hath done ſuch great Things for us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:008599_0035_102F95BA456A9CA8"/>
Worthy our Attention and Imitation is that Example of King <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> and his People's uniting their joyful. Thankſgivings to God, on an Occaſion ſomething ſimilar. The Scripture-Story (2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 20.) informs us, how "on the fourth Day" after a ſignal Conqueſt, the King and his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple on the Field of Action, <q>aſſembled themſelves, &amp; <hi>bleſſed the</hi> LORD. Then they returned every Man, and <hi>Jehoſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat</hi> in the Fore-front of them, to go again to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with <hi>Joy:</hi> for the LORD <hi>had made them to rejoyce over their Enemies.</hi>—And the Fear of GOD was on all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of thoſe Countries, when they had heard that the LORD had <hi>fought againſt the Enemies of Iſrael.</hi> So the Realm of <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> was <hi>quiet:</hi> for his <hi>God gave him Reſt round about.</hi>
               </q> The <hi>Succeſs</hi> they had, and their <hi>Joy</hi> upon it, are aſcribed to God, as equally the Author of both. Doubtleſs, as to the Royal General, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his People, it was that <hi>Joy</hi> which <hi>is the Fruit of the Spirit,</hi>—a religious Exultation, a "Rejoycing <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord</hi>", and "triumphing in <hi>his Praiſe</hi>". They triumphed and rejoyced <hi>over their Enemies;</hi> but ſtill in a Frame and Manner becoming ſuch as ſaw and owned the Hand of <hi>God</hi> in their Succeſs, and meant to "give Glory to his Name". This Scripture-Pattern ſerves to juſtify the preſent <hi>Feſtival;</hi> and recommends to our Practice the ſolemn, but chearful Duties, we are now called together joyntly to perform.</p>
            <p>Let us then give ourſelves, on this delightful Occaſion, to holy Rejoycing, Thanksgiving and Praiſe. Let us "<hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider</hi> how great Things God hath done for us", particularly reſpecting the important <hi>Conqueſt,</hi> whereof we are <hi>glad.</hi> Let us realiſe what abundant Reaſon we have to admire the Conduct of Divine Providence, relative to this Affair, view'd in its whole State, from its Beginning, through all its Progreſs, to its happy Termination. We ſhould take Notice of GOD's Goodneſs in putting into the <hi>King's</hi> Heart ſuch an earneſt Care for our Security and Welfair: and in guiding the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of the King's <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> to project the beſt Meaſures, and to employ the beſt Agents in executing the wife Plan of Operations. In ſhort, every Inſtance of good Conduct, and of Reſolution, and Fortitude, every Inſtance of Support
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:008599_0036_102F95BBD010CB00"/>
and Succeſs in this grand Affair, from its Commencement to its Concluſion, ſhould be taken Notice of, as the Effect of a propitious <hi>Providence</hi> ſuper-intending &amp; preſiding in it. Every advantageous Circumſtance, every ſubſervient and auxiliary Incident, as well as the grand and final Event, is to obſerved, as the Fruit of Divine Benignity. All tends to heighten the Glory and the Mercy of the Succeſs: and all conſpires to demand our grateful Acknowledgments to "the Lord of Hoſts" the ſupreme Author of Victory.</p>
            <p>We are called, on this Occaſion to ſing both of <hi>Mercy,</hi> and of <hi>Judgment;</hi> to ſing of both "to the Lord our God" to celebrate the Wonders of <hi>Mercy</hi> to us, and of <hi>Judgment</hi> on our Enemies.—Yea, his <hi>Judgments</hi> on ourſelves, in the general Calamity of War, and in particular Diſaſters, are not to be forgotten, even in our Songs of Praiſe. As mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and joyful Events are mingled in Providence, we ſhould have our Reflexions on both, in the Exerciſe of various Paſſions, correſponding to each. Antecedent <hi>humbling</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents might be deſign'd in Providence to prepare a juſt <hi>Allay</hi> to future Joys: And the <hi>Evil</hi> intermixed with the <hi>Good</hi> we receive at the Hand of the LORD, may well ſerve to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and qualify the <hi>Pleaſure</hi> his Benefits give us. It will be wife in us to to temper the Joy that now expands our Breaſts, by proper Reflexions on the inauſpicious and dark Appearances preceding our late Succeſſes, &amp; on the diſaſtrous Events attending them. One Circumſtance, in particular, ſhould not a little affect us, that human Life has ſo often been ſacrificed (by the Sword, or Diſeaſe, or Accident) in the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of <hi>Victory;</hi> and as Victory is apprehended to have been <hi>loſt,</hi> in one memorable Inſtance, by "the Fall of the Mighty,<note n="*" place="bottom">The brave Lord Howe. in that fruitleſs Attempt at <hi>Ticonderoga.</hi>
               </note> ſo it hath in ſeveral Inſtances been <hi>purchaſed</hi> at the Expence of ſome of the moſt precious Blood, in the Fall of heroic <hi>Generals</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Gen. WOLFE, and Gen. PRIDEAUX, who both expired amidſt Glory, in the near View of Conqueſt.</note> and other gallant Officers and Men. Theſe are ſtriking Events, at the Remembrance of which we can ſcarce refrain mingling Tears with our preſent Joys. But the Sorrow for <hi>former</hi> Loſſes, of this Kind, we muſt balance with the Joy of our laſt Succeſſes being obtained without any
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:008599_0037_102F95BD64661998"/>
ſuch aggravated Loſſes, and with an uncommonly ſmall Effuſion of Blood.—However, I think, no Reflexions whatever ſhould ſuppreſs our <hi>Joy</hi> on this grand Occaſion, though they may be needful to reſtrain &amp; moderate it.</p>
            <p>A Tranſport of Mind, on the News of a Conqueſt and Acquiſition, ſo big with Salvation and Bleſſing to one's Country as this we are now rejoycing in, is ſcarce avoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and is certainly allowable. And the more nearly we are intereſted in the Succeſs, naturally the more elevated will the Pleaſure be. In this Reſpect, though the Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the <hi>Pruſſian, Hanoverian,</hi> and <hi>Britiſh</hi> Arms in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> at this Day is juſt Matter of Joy and Praiſe; yet it is reaſonably to be expected, that Victory nearer <hi>Home,</hi> and more immediately affecting our ſelves, ſhould ſtrike our Minds with a ſingular Force, and that ſo great &amp; important a Conqueſt as that which occaſions this Day's Solemnity, ſhould open all the Springs of pleaſing Paſſions, and ſwell the Tide of Joy beyond its common Bounds.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, let it not be meerly a <hi>rejoycing over our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,</hi> nor only rejoycing in our own Proſperity. But let the Joy be ſublimated, ſpiritualized, and carried up to its proper ultimate Object, "the Captain of our Salvation," the Giver of Victory.—By all Means let us ſee to it, that our rejoycing on the preſent Occaſion be duly regulated—Not the meer Mirth of <hi>Brutes,</hi> centring in animal Pleaſures—Not the Mirth of <hi>Fools,</hi> conducted as if we had no Fear of God before our Eyes, and expreſſed only in Laughter &amp; Levity, in lawleſs Feaſting and Frolicking—Nor yet only the more ſober and temperate (but almoſt as carnal) Joy of <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,</hi> who honour God with joyful Lips, while yet in their Hearts and Lives they diſhonour Him; being in truth "evil and unthankful".—Nor let it be a proud and ſelf-boaſting Joy, as if "our own Arm had ſaved us", or our own Worthineſs had procured us the Victory. "Neither glory ye in Men."—"All ſuch Rejoycing is evil."—"But he that glorieth, let him glory in the LORD."</p>
            <p>Let our Rejoycing be manly, rational, ſpiritual, devotio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and "after a godly Sort", in all its Exerciſes &amp; Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.—Let the Joy of our Hearts tranſpire thro' our Lips in the moſt grateful Acknowledgments &amp; Praiſes to God, in the
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:008599_0038_102F95C0E814AA78"/>
Name of Jeſus Chriſt. Thus will our <hi>Joy</hi> be conſecrated, and turned into a <hi>Sacrifice;</hi> a "ſpiritual Sacrifice, accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God by Jeſus Chriſt". And the ſacred Pleaſure will be gradually increaſed by daily renewed Thankſgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Praiſes.—Only, at the ſame Time, "let our <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation</hi> be as becometh the Goſpel", that by our obedient Lives, as well as joyful and thankful Lips, we may teſtify our Delight in God, and prove the Sincerity of our Gratitude to Him. Surely the Call of Heaven to us at this Day is in ſuch Language as that (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 24.) "<hi>Only fear the Lord, and ſerve him in Truth: for conſider how great Things he hath done for you.</hi> Or, that (Pſal. 2. 11.) <hi>Serve the Lord with Fear, and rejoyce with Trembling.</hi> As God has been doing great Things for us, ſurely he expects great Things <hi>from</hi> us, in a way of practical Returns. And be it remembred, He that has done great Things <hi>for</hi> us, the ſame can alſo do great Things <hi>againſt</hi> us. We ſee, his almighty Hand can bring about great Changes in a little Time. And when we reflect on the Mutability of human Affairs, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with our Unworthineſs of Divine Favours, and our Deſert of Judgments, it becomes us to "rejoyce with Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling." In unſpotted Juſtice, God might have made our Enemies to rejoyce over us: and he may do it ſtill. What can we expect, but the Tokens of his Diſpleaſure, in this or ſome other tremendous Way, unleſs his Goodneſs effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally leadeth us to Repentance!</p>
            <p>To our Praiſes therefore let us add our <hi>Prayers,</hi> that Proſperity may be ſanctify'd to us, and made a prevailing Argument with us, from a Senſe of Ingenuity &amp; Gratitude, to ſerve the LORD with Gladneſs. Let us pray that the Spirit may be poured from on high, to reſtore Religion to a proſperous and victorious State. Let us implore a Divine Bleſſing on the King's Counſels and Efforts for a ſafe and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous Peace. But above all, let it be our Care and Prayer, that the Kingdom of the Son of God may be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; that the Conqueſts of his Power &amp; Grace over the Souls of Men may ſpread through the World; that there may be Glory to God in the higheſt, Peace on Earth, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will towards Men.</p>
