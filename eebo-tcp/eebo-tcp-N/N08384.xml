            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE valuable writings of that pious chriſtian, <hi>William Penn,</hi> of which I am a great admirer, as they appear to be written from the heart, with a view to promote the happineſs of mankind in general; I therefore ſincerely wiſh they were more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally read and attended to than I believe they are.— But being ſenſible that many are deprived of the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of his writings, from their inability to purchaſe them (being compriſed in two large and expenſive volumes)—I have thought it my duty to get this ſhort Extract printed, (containing a very intereſting Summons, &amp;c. to the World) in a ſmall pamphlet, for the benefit of ſuch who are not able to purchaſe his works, as well as the Public in general; to whom I beg leave to recommend it as what is of infinite concern to them.— I ſubſcribe myſelf a well-wiſher to the happineſs of mankind in general.</p>

Does he rule there? Then have you eternal life abiding in you: If not, you are not <hi>true Chriſtians.</hi> The <hi>ſpirit</hi> of <hi>truth</hi> leadeth into all <hi>truth;</hi> and the <hi>children of God</hi> are born of it, and led by it. But are you led into all the holy <hi>ways</hi> of <hi>truth,</hi> born of this eternal ſpirit?

               <hi>GOD hath ſo loved the world,</hi> that he hath ſent his only begotten <hi>Son</hi> into the world, that thoſe that believe on him, ſhould have eternal life. And this ſon is <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> the true <hi>light,</hi> that lighteth every one coming into the <hi>world;</hi> and they that abide not

in him the <hi>light,</hi> dwell in <hi>darkneſs,</hi> in <hi>ſin,</hi> and are under the region and ſhadow of death: Yea <hi>dead</hi> in <hi>ſin,</hi> and ſee not their own ſtates, neither perceive the ſad conditions of their own ſouls. They are blind to the things of God's kingdom, and unſenſible of true and ſpiritual <hi>life,</hi> and <hi>motion,</hi> what it is to live to God: And in that ſtate, are alienated from God, without true judgment and living knowledge; and under the curſe. For in Jeſus Chriſt, the <hi>light</hi> of the <hi>world,</hi> are hid all the treaſures of wiſdom and knowledge, redemption and glory; they are hid from the <hi>worldly chriſtian,</hi> from all that are captivated by the ſpirit and luſts of the world: And whoever would ſee them, (for therein conſiſt the things, that belong to their eternal peace) muſt come to Chriſt Jeſus the true <hi>light</hi> in their conſciences, bring their deeds to him, love him and obey him; whom God hath ordained a <hi>light to lighten the Gentiles, and for his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to the ends of the earth. Light and ſalvation</hi> are joined together, and none can come to ſalvation, but as they come firſt to the light, and ſubmit to the manifeſtation of it, which leadeth to ſalvation. For <hi>the nations of them that are ſaved, ſhall walk in the light of the lamb,</hi> Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> are alſo joined together: <hi>If we walk in the light, as God is in the light, the blood of Jeſus Chriſt his ſon cleanſeth us from all ſin.</hi> And <hi>light</hi> and <hi>life eternal</hi> are joined together: <hi>For in the word</hi> (that was with God in the beginning, and was God, by whom <hi>all things</hi> were made, that were made) <hi>was life, and the life was the light of men.</hi> And this is the teſtimony of Jeſus, <hi>I am the light of the world; he that followeth me, ſhall not abide in darkneſs, but have the light of life;</hi> yea, it is <hi>eternal life,</hi> to believe in him, in Chriſt the <hi>light,</hi> to receive, embrace, and to follow him. And <hi>that was the true light</hi> (ſaith the ſame beloved

diſciple) <hi>which lighteth every man, that cometh into the world.</hi> Now this <hi>light</hi> ſhineth in <hi>darkneſs,</hi> in the children of darkneſs, in their dark hearts, in their black ſouls, and defiled conſciences, but in this <hi>dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> they comprehend it not. Neither can man know the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>benefit</hi> of it, while he rebelleth againſt it; for the virtue and excellency of it is ſhut up and hid from the <hi>children</hi> of <hi>diſobedience.</hi> To as many as received him of old, gave he power to become the <hi>children</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> and they that did his will, knew his doctrine to be of God, and of power and efficacy to their ſalvation.</p>
            <p>But this is the great <hi>condemnation</hi> of the <hi>world</hi> at this day, that though <hi>God</hi> hath ſent his <hi>ſon</hi> a <hi>light</hi> into the hearts of all men and women, to manifeſt and reprove their evil deeds, and to ſave them; yet they love <hi>darkneſs,</hi> they love the luſts and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their vain hearts, better than this holy <hi>light,</hi> that is given unto them for <hi>ſalvation:</hi> They chuſe <hi>Barabbas</hi> rather than <hi>Jeſus.</hi> Yea they have ſet up other <hi>lights,</hi> than Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>God's</hi> great <hi>light;</hi> and other <hi>prophets</hi> than <hi>Chriſt,</hi> God's great <hi>prophet;</hi> and other <hi>prieſts</hi> than <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the <hi>High-Prieſt</hi> of the new covenant: But they are <hi>dark lights, falſe prophets,</hi> and <hi>blind prieſts. All that came before me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>are thieves and robbers:</hi> And all that pray, preach, ſing, worſhip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and not by the <hi>light</hi> and <hi>ſpirit</hi> of Jeſus, they go before Chriſt, before Chriſt cometh, before he prepareth their hearts, and toucheth their lips with a coal, from his heavenly altar; and perform worſhip in their own will, time and power, and ſtay not for his leadings. And therefore all ſuch rob <hi>Chriſt</hi> of his <hi>office,</hi> who is the <hi>leader</hi> of the true <hi>chriſtians,</hi> their heavenly <hi>High-Prieſt,</hi> to anoint them, and offer up their ſacrifice to God for them; and <hi>prophet,</hi> to let them ſee and know by his <hi>light,</hi> in

their hearts, what they ought to do according to the new and everlaſting covenant; <hi>I will write my law in their hearts, and put my ſpirit in their inward parts, and they ſhall be all taught of me, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this is the queſtion to the whole world called Chriſtians: <hi>Do you ſee with this divine light? Have you ſearched your hearts with it? And are you anointed by this High-Prieſt with his holy unction, that leadeth into all truth? Doth this heavenly prophet give you viſion, and reveal the father to you? Is he your eye, your head, your wiſdom? Do you live, move, and have your life and being in him, in praying, preaching, and ſinging,</hi> yea, <hi>in your whole converſation? Are you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed into his life and image? And have you heard his voice, and ſeen his ſhape? Are you witneſſes of his holy rebukes, his pure judgments, the ſhame and death of his croſs? Is he the fountain of your knowledge? The author of your faith?</hi> O conſider! <hi>Are you of thoſe, that have ſpoke with Jeſus? That have been taught in the ſchool of his holy croſs? Students in his heavenly academy? O have you drank of his cup, and been baptized with his baptiſm?</hi> Tell me in the fear of the Lord God, you that call yourſelves <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> doth he go before you, and lead you as a maſter teacheth his <hi>diſciples,</hi> and a <hi>Captain</hi> leadeth his <hi>ſoldiers?</hi> And do you follow him in all the weighty things of this life? And doth he order your minds, and rule your affections? If not, you are <hi>thieves</hi> and <hi>robbers;</hi> for you rob <hi>Chriſt</hi> of his <hi>office.</hi> For God hath appointed him to be the <hi>leader</hi> and <hi>ruler</hi> of all people; yea, 'tis God's decree; and thoſe that he leadeth not in their thoughts, words, and works, ſhall never come to God: For all muſt come to God by him, that is, by his <hi>light,</hi> and <hi>ſpirit</hi> ruling in their hearts, which ſanctifieth, regenerateth, and converteth the ſoul to God.</p>

Your worſhip God loatheth: A dog's neck, ſwines blood, yea to bleſs an idol, or kill a man, is altogether as acceptable with the Lord. O! God is wrath with the feigned worſhips, as well as common ungodlineſs of the world: Come to Chriſt's ſpirit, be led of it, and do not your own wills, but the will of Chriſt Jeſus; and then you ſhall know the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. For the true miniſtry and worſhip of God ſtand not in the will, wiſdom, or appointment of men, nor can they be performed by unregenerated men; but in the leadings of his eternal ſpirit, by whom all the faithful offer up themſelves, an accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſacrifice to God, not to live unto themſelves, but to him that hath purchaſed them. 'Tis true, Chriſt Jeſus died for the <hi>ungodly,</hi> but not that they ſhould continue <hi>ungodly, but take up his daily croſs and follow him. Chriſt</hi> (ſaith <hi>Peter) ſuffered for us, leaving us an example that we ſhould follow his ſteps:</hi> As he was in this world, ſo we ſhould be, not conformable to the rudiments, faſhions, and cuſtoms of this world, that paſs away; but transformed and renewed in our minds by the grace that he hath given us: Which <hi>grace bringeth ſalvation</hi> to all that obey it, <hi>teaching</hi> ſuch to deny all <hi>ungodlineſs and worldly luſts,</hi> and to <hi>live ſoberly, righteouſly, and Godly in this preſent</hi> evil <hi>world:</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>without holineſs, none ſhall</hi> ever <hi>ſee the Lord:</hi> That is God's decree.</p>
            <p>Wherefore be you not deceived, O you formal and titular Chriſtians; <hi>God will not be mocked: Such as you ſow, ſuch ſhall you reap at the hand of the Lord; yea,

for every idle word ſhall you give account in the day of judgment.</hi> Think not with yourſelves, you have Chriſt to your Saviour, and your are reconciled to God, through <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and that God looketh not upon you, as you are in yourſelves, but as in <hi>Chriſt;</hi> whilſt you walk not after the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> but after the <hi>fleſh:</hi> For the <hi>wages of ſin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord:</hi> To whom? Not to them that deſpiſe <hi>his light</hi> in their hearts, that grieve <hi>his ſpirit,</hi> and by a worldly converſation go on to crucify him; and who follow not Jeſus in the way of tribulation and regeneration. <hi>God is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity;</hi> and he looketh upon men and women to be, what they really are, and not what they imagine themſelves to be: Behold he cometh, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>Therefore be ye ſeperate from every evil way: Chriſt, the <hi>immaculate lamb of God,</hi> came not only to ſave men from wrath, but from ſin, which is the cauſe of wrath. <hi>Behold the lamb of God,</hi> ſaith John, <hi>which taketh away the ſin of the world:</hi> Not their ſin that will not believe in him, but the ſins of thoſe <hi>that are weary and heavy laden, that wait, hunger, thirſt, and cry for his ſalvation; whom God hath given for a light to lighten the Gentiles, and for his ſalvation to the ends of the earth.</hi> O you that are called by his ſacred
