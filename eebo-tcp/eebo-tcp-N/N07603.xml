            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <p>WE take the earlieſt opportunity after our being met together to give your excellency notice of it; and this we look upon to be the more neceſſary ſince our converſing upon the ſubject of a future congreſs has occaſioned an alteration of the place of meeting.
<note place="margin">An alteration of place propoſed.</note> A change in every reſpect ſo much more convenient to us, will, we flatter ourſelves, not be otherwiſe to you; the diſtance will, we underſtand, be the ſame, and the accommodations no doubt better: It was the intention of ſome of us to have gone up Savannah river by water, but the tediouſneſs of that paſſage has deterred us,
<note place="margin">Difficulty of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by water,</note> as the difficulty, if not impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
<note place="margin">Or by land, to Auguſta.</note> of conveying ourſelves, and the neceſſary conveniencies, by land, has made us lay aſide all thoughts of this alſo. The behaviour of ſome of the Indians to the king's ſubjects,
<note place="margin">And the ill beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the Indians, point out the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and their ill diſpoſition towards one another, points out too the propriety, of aſſembling them at ſome place where they will be under a greater check and controul, than they would be in ſo ſtraggling and ill-ſettled a place as Auguſta: but with regard to the Indians themſelves, we imagine the alteration will not be diſagreeable; they were before appriſed that Auguſta was pitched upon,
<note place="margin">Small-pox in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolina, the reaſon why Auguſta was at firſt propoſed.</note> becauſe the ſmall-pox was in Carolina; that diſorder having long ſince ceaſed, will be reaſon therefore ſufficient to aſſign for the change of place. The Chactahs,
<note place="margin">That obſtacle now removed.</note> Chicaſahs and Catawbas, are not at all likely to make objections; the Cherokees are extremely averſe to going to Auguſta; and if the Creeks ſhould entertain any jealouſy, the ſuperintendent will no doubt be able to convince them, that nothing is intended by the change of place, but to render the meeting more commodious to the governors, ſome of which have already come a great way, and will ſuffer unavoidably by proceeding farther. Capt. Stuart will either lodge the preſents at Auguſta, or order them back again, as may appear to him the moſt proper, when he has ſounded the Indians on this ſubject. We ſhould have been glad, if time would have permitted to have known your ſentiments upon this alteration; but the day appointed draws ſo near, that capt. Stuart thinks it proper to ſet off on thurſday, in order to be ready to receive ſuch Indians as may arrive. We are,</p>

                     <p>I HAVE juſt received yours of the 4th inſtant, acquainting me with an intended alteration of the place of meeting to hold the future congreſs. The change, if to be in Charles-Town, is certainly more convenient and agreeable to you, and it ever gives me pleaſure, when, in executing any part of my duty, I can do it in ſuch manner as may be moſt agreeable to thoſe concerned; though I muſt obſerve, that the difficulties thrown in the way, I conceive (on a trial) would not have proved ſo great as repreſented or imagined.

Mr. Stuart, in his letter to me, does not mention the leaſt difficulty or objection made by the Cherokees againſt Auguſta, but that they had received his invitation with the greateſt cordiality and joy. And I ſhould ſuppoſe the Chactahs and Chicaſahs would have no objections to a ſaving of three hundred miles travelling. You have omitted to mention the place, only in a poſtſcript ſay, "the Indians will be ordered to Dorcheſter." The time I preſume is now uncertain; but, when you are pleaſed to inform me of that and the place, I ſhall certainly attend, if health permits.

                     <p>WE have this morning been favoured with your letter of the 8th inſtant, upon which we think it juſt neceſſary to obſerve, that Auguſta, its ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations and ſecurity, muſt have been miſrepreſented to us; and beſides, that the getting there at all,
<note place="margin">Difficulty of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Auguſts very great.</note> with the leaſt degree of convenience to ourſelves, was ſcarce poſſible. Mr. Stuart might have omitted acquainting your excellency with the diſinclination of the Cherokees to meet at Auguſta,
<note place="margin">The Cherokees diſinclined to meet there, and propoſe Saludy old-town for the congreſs.</note> in conſequence of two of their nation being killed by the Creeks; but they expreſſed it ſtrongly to him, propoſed Saludy old-town for the congreſs, and determined to wait on the path in hopes of an alteration of place. We are in great hopes, that the late outrages committed by the upper Creeks are not the acts of the nation in general;
<note place="margin">Obſervations on the conduct of the Creek Indians.</note> but, if the generality were well inclined, they would either prevent, or puniſh, ſuch frequent repetitions of inſolence and murder. A letter of the 4th inſtant, which governor Boone has received from Auguſta,
<note place="margin">Information re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-Creeks would not come at all.</note> ſays, that none of the Creeks will be there, at the congreſs; if this was their reſolution before the place of meeting was changed, it looks as if they could not hope, that their offences would be forgiven them: With regard to the Chactahs and Chicaſahs, they are already on their route;

                     <p>LAST night I received a letter, ſent by an expreſs, from Auguſta, informing me,
<note place="margin">He ſays, the Wolf king is gone to Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacola—a bad omen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </note> that the Wolf king was gone to Penſacola, to make ſome demands relative to the ceded lands; and giving an account of the ſituation of affairs in the upper Creeks, which, to ſay no more, I think have not a very pleaſing aſpect,
<note place="margin">Calls his council, on the preſent criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſituation of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian affairs.</note> and made me determine to call the gentlemen of the council together, for their opinion on the preſent appearance of things amongſt the Indians, and what may be moſt proper to be done, for his majeſty's ſervice in general, and the ſafety of this province in particular, in caſe Mr. Stuart cannot prevail on the Creeks to proceed to Dorcheſter or Charles-Town. My laſt, by Joyner, I wrote immediately on the receipt of yours, on a ſuppoſition, and in hopes, that Mr. Stuart might prevail with the Creeks to proceed down: but, on the receipt of my letters laſt night, I began to reflect more fully on the conſequence of their refuſing to go any further; and the more I reflect on the critical ſituation of affairs with theſe Indians,
<note place="margin">Much evil to be expected, if the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians return in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt.</note> the more I am convinced of the danger that, in all probability, will attend their returning home diſguſted; and I very much fear they will not go down to Dorcheſter; they are not in a ſituation or humour to follow orders.—Nay, I am apprehenſive, if they ſhould hear of an intention to carry them down to Charles-Town, they will not come even to Auguſta, and therefore I have now wrote to lieutenant Barnard and Mr. Galphin, deſiring them to give Mr. Stuart their beſt aſſiſtance in the affair — Gentlemen at a diſtance, may not ſee or conſider this matter in the light it ſtrikes me; and a Creek war, may be as litle felt in Virginia, as the northern maſſacres are in this province; our commiſeration is of little ſervice to thoſe who feel and ſuffer; even North and South Carolina would feel little or nothing of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And his majeſty's council are unanimouſly and clearly of opinion,
<note place="margin">The council ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe him to meet the ſavages at Auguſta.</note> that, ſhould the Creek Indians refuſe to go down to Charles-Town, and return back from Auguſta diſpleaſed, at this critical conjuncture, it might be productive of the worſt conſequences, to his majeſty's ſervice in general, and the ſafety of this province in particular; and therefore, in order to prevent, if poſſible, the dangers that may attend their returning diſguſted, have adviſed me, in caſe the Indians refuſe to proceed to Charles-Town, to meet them at Auguſta, as the beſt, if not the only, method, to prevent further miſunderſtandings with them, and to promote his majeſty's moſt gracious intentions, and eſtabliſhing peace and friendſhip with them on a more firm baſis.</p>
                     <p>This advice entirely coincides with my own opinion; and I judge it altogether expedient for me to go up to Auguſta to meet them,
<note place="margin">He agrees with his council in that point.</note> in caſe they will not proceed to Charles-Town, and can be prevailed on to wait at Auguſta.</p>
                     <p>I ſend a perſon expreſs to acquaint your excellencies with this matter. If the Indians in general go to Charles-Town, I ſhall attend the congreſs there: If they will not go, it then ſeems abſolutely neceſſary for me to proceed to Auguſta,

                     <p>WE are this moment favoured with your letter of the 11th, by expreſs; and, after having ſeriouſly conſidered it, find no freſh intelligence but what our letter of yeſterday obſerved upon; nor conceive a difficulty or objection to be ſtarted by the Creeks,
<note place="margin">The Creeks objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to meet at Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter, balanced by the Cherokees diſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Auguſta.</note> againſt coming to Dorcheſter, but what may, and, according to our information, will be urged by the Cherokees, againſt their going to Auguſta; this, in great meaſure, induced us to change the place appointed. The ſuperintendent,

                        </gap> may be more beneficial to them to have the congreſs at Auguſta. You may obſerve, Sir, that they are not in a humour to follow orders: But if the Creeks, or any, after ſo ſolemn an invitation on the part of four provinces, ſhould be either refractory or ſulky, we cannot think, they ſhould be either careſſed or indulged. On the ſervice we are now ordered by the king,

than by convincing each nation of Indians, that the four ſouthern governors act in concurrence; every expreſſion of kindneſs will have additional weight, and the danger of breaking with us will be evidently greater; and this is certainly the ſpirit of the king's intentions: we therefore muſt beg you to exert your influence with the Creeks, that the congreſs may, as it was intended, be general. We have not heard from Mr. Stuart ſince he left this place, ſo that, at preſent, we may preſume, he ſees no further objection, though appriſed of all Indian intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.

                     <p>I GOT to this fort the 11th current,
<note place="margin">Only 60 Indians (Catawbas) at Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſta, the 11th of October.</note> where I found no other Indians than about ſixty Catawbas, including women and children, who had been here about two days before my arrival. On the thirteenth, in the morning, I received a letter, by expreſs, from lieutenant Taylor, dated 10th, referring me to the intelligence contained in the incloſed letter to your excellency, and which I imagine contains full accounts of what paſſes in that nation. I likewiſe ſend a duplicate of the talk ſent here from the lower Creeks, by the meſſenger of whom Mr. Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell wrote you,
<note place="margin">Little hopes of getting the ſavages to Dorcheſter.</note> with lieutenant Barnard's anſwer; by which your excellency, and the other governors, will be able to judge of their temper, and which gave me bad hopes of ſucceſs in endeavouring to perſuade them to go further.
<note place="margin">An upper Creek warrior, &amp;c. arrive 14th Oct and with them the Chicaſah leader, and a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal headman of the Chactahs.</note> Yeſterday in the morning, the upper Creek warrior Muſtiſicah, with the ſecond man of the Tuckabatchies, and a number of their followers, came here; with them were, the leader of the Chicaſahs, Pia-mattah; one conſiderable leading man of the Chactah nation called Red-Shoes, and about twenty Chicaſahs of note, and their followers: Colbert, who had arrived ſome days before them, informed me, that his reception, in the Chactah nation, had been moſt friendly; that many of the moſt conſiderable amongſt them had determined to accompany him down, but upon receiving news that two of their people were killed by the Creeks,
<note place="margin">Two Chactahs kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Creeks.</note> none thought proper to venture except this Red-Shoes. Colbert adds, that the treatment which he and the Chicaſahs received,
<note place="margin">Creeks inſolent to the Chicaſahs &amp; Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert their interpreter</note> in their way through the Creek nation, was extremely inſolent, and had made thoſe Indians extremely anxious to return home; accordingly, they preſſed me much to diſpatch them: I invited them to come to the fort this day,
<note place="margin">Chicaſahs, Creeks and Catawbas ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the change of place.</note> with the Catawbas and Creeks; I acquainted them with the alteration of the place of meeting propoſed, and the reaſons for it. The Chicaſah leader ſaid, he had come a great way upon my invitation, and found himſelf diſappointed;
<note place="margin">Chicaſah leader re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes to go further, yet not diſpleaſed.</note> that he was too much tired to go any farther, and ſhould return without taking any thing amiſs; that ſuch accidents were often not to be avoided; that he was glad he had ſeen me; and whenever he ſhould promiſe me any thing, I might depend upon meeting with no diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The next who ſpoke, was the ſecond man of the Creeks, who ſaid, that he had come punctually at the time, and to the place of appointment, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to have ſeen the governors; that it was their hunting ſeaſon, when they ſhould have been in the woods providing for their families, but that their time was taken up in this viſit, which they ſhould not think loſt, if I would deliver the king's talk to them, and diſpatch them immediately; that ſeveral of their own people had promiſed to attend the meeting, who were not come, but that it ſeemed to be the preſent prevailing cuſtom for men to ſpeak with two tongues.

I repeated the reaſons for altering the place of meeting, which I enlarged upon as much as the ſubject would admit, and deſired they would let me know, after conſidering the affair maturely, whether or not they would go to Dorcheſter: they did not heſitate a moment, but poſitively refuſed to go one ſtep further.
<note place="margin">Creeks alſo refuſe to go further.</note> I then aſked, if they would ſtay here 'till the return of a meſſenger I ſhould ſend to the governors? this, with great difficulty, the Creeks were prevailed upon to conſent to: they have agreed to wait here ten days,
<note place="margin">At laſt agree to wait ten days for the return of an expreſs.</note> at the expiration of which time, if they do not ſee the governors, or receive the king's meſſage from me, they are infallibly to go away. Lieutenant Barnard ſends an expreſs to governor Wright, who will be acquainted with what has paſſed, about the time this reaches your excellency's hands.

<note place="margin">The Creeks ſeem diſpoſed for war.</note> than at this time; and as thoſe who are now here, and who are ſuppoſed to be the beſt affected to us of any, are ſo jealous, there cannot be any room to hope, that others, who are hourly expected here, will conſent to go down to Dorcheſter: they are conſcious of their bad behaviour,

<note place="margin">A party of them gone to Penſacola, to preſcribe bounds to the Engliſh there.</note> are now gone to Penſacola, to circumſcribe the limits of the garriſon within ſuch a narrow compaſs as will hardly allow them garden room.</p>
                     <p>The Chicaſahs knew the determination of the Creeks to go no farther than this place (as all the Indians had received intimation of the alteration propoſed,
<note place="margin">They were before apprized of the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of place.</note> and had conſulted upon it, before they ſpoke with me). Pia mattah conſidered, that,

                        <note place="margin">Talk from the lower Creeks.</note>WE, headmen of the lower Creeks has heard bad talks, and are deſirous to hear the truth. When we were young men, the governor of Charles-Town always ſpoke good and friendly to us, and told us that the path ſhould be ſtraight and white to the nation; and it is our deſire it ſhould ſo continue,<note place="margin">They make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of friendſhip to the Engliſh.</note> and to let the governors ſee our good intentions. We, headmen of the lower towns, will ſtill hold the Engliſh faſt by the hand; it is the great God above that gave us the knowledge ſo to do. We have heard a word amongſt us, which has put us in a fright, and don't know what to do 'till we hear the truth.<note place="margin">But are alarmed at ſome bad talks ſpread among them.</note> We were intending down to Auguſta, 'till this news came up amongſt us; for we ſaw the great king's talk, and it was a very good one; we all got together to hear it, and, agreeable to the white people's deſire, we intended to go down; it was not we lower towns only that were ſent for, it was all the Engliſh friends, the upper towns, the Chicaſahs, Chactahs, &amp;c. We hear the upper towns does not intend to go down; and we are afraid, that if only we lower towns go, we might be detained 'till the upper towns came down,
<note place="margin">And afraid to loſe their horſes.</note> and thereby might loſe our horſes. Theſe three rivers are all one people, and the upper towns does not want to go down; but we don't throw away the white people's talk; and we deſire the governors to ſend us word,
<note place="margin">Therefore deſire to be diſpatched.</note> whether we lower towns may be diſpatched when we go down. When the governors ſees this talk, they may conſider, and think that we have ſome reaſon for not coming down at the time appointed. It ſeems you keep your talk very private, but there is nothing to be hid from we red people: there was a red man from the Tuckabatchies went down with the white people, and when he got to Auguſta, the white people deſired him to go back imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, and he came away according to their deſire; as he returned back, he overtook a gang of pack-horſes, and kept company with them to the Oakmuljees, and a white man told him ſeveral things, but whether it be true or not we cannot tell; this man that brings us this news, is an old man, and would not tell lies: we have heard,
<note place="margin">They ſuſpect that the governors want their lands.</note> that the governor of Charles-Town intends to buy our lands from us, as far as Ogeechie, and as high up as Broad-River; and the governor of Savannah intends to buy from us, as far as the fork of Alatamaha; and the governor of North-Carolina intends to buy as far as the Okonies: we lower people deſired this man not to ſpeak of this to any of the towns where the murder was committed, but keep it ſecret 'till we heard the truth: and we have ſent down a red man with the white man, and we deſire that the red man and white man may be paid for their trouble.</p>

The great king's deſign, in ordering all his governors to act in concert as one man, and in inviting all the nations bordering on theſe colonies, to hear his talk, was directly contrary to what you have heard; for we ſhall there declare, that your lands will not be taken from you; and this is to be done before you all, and not in ſecret, that no nation of Indians may be ignorant of his gracious intentions, and of his fatherly care of the red as well as the white. We have ſent this talk previous to our coming, but which we ſhall follow immediately, to convince you of our ſincerity, and to

                     <p>LAST night I was honoured with your excellencies letter of 15th current, incloſing a copy of governor Wright's letter of 11th and your anſwer; and before now governor Boone muſt have received my letter of 16th, by expreſs, in which I fully informed him of my tranſactions with the Indians, <note place="margin">Lower Creeks and Cherokees expected at Auguſts 20th of October.</note> and of their abſolute refuſal to proceed to Dorcheſter. The lower Creeks and Cherokees will be here this day, being only a few miles off. The upper Creeks, of whom a conſiderable number are here, <note place="margin">Upper Creeks per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in their reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which governs the Chicaſahs.</note> remain firm in their determination to proceed no further into the ſettlements, and their reſolution will determine the Chicaſahs.</p>

A regard to your excellencies conveniency, induced me to acquieſe in your propoſal of altering the place of meeting, and to uſe my utmoſt endeavours to reconcile the Indians to that meaſure, <note place="margin">Mr. Stuart ſuſpects the Indians to be privately tampered with by the traders.</note> although I then expreſſed a doubt of being able to prevail on the Creeks to proceed further into the ſettlements, having had no intelligence from the upper Creeks, Chactahs, and Chicaſahs, or anſwer to the invitation I ſent them, on the part, and by order, of the king, to meet your excellencies and me, upon the ſpecial ſervice we have in charge. I could not be certain of ſucceſs, and I did not doubt but your excellencies had reſolved on the meaſures to be purſued by you in caſe of a diſappointment. I am conſcious of having done my duty, by endeavouring to remove their jealouſies, and uſing every argument that occurred to me, to induce them to proceed. If the Indians be privately tampered with (which I ſuſpect) it muſt be by the traders, the very channel through which I am obliged to converſe with them. My beſt endeavours to engage the good offices of the traders, <note place="margin">And doubts his own influence as ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendent.</note> on this occaſion, have and ſhall not be wanting; but my influence may poſſibly be very inſufficient, for, as matters are now ſituated, they have nothing to fear or hope from my authority as ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendent: but perhaps Mr. Wright's endeavours may be more efficacious, and I learn that he is ſoon expected.</p>
                     <p>Upon the whole, as I ſhall uſe all poſſible means to accompliſh what I came about, if I fail, I hope to be free from cenſure and blame.</p>

19th. I arrived in the Oakchoys, and called all the headmen of the upper Creeks together, and was well treated there by pointing their guns at me.</p>
                           <p>23d. I ſet out for the Chactah nation. On the way I met with Mr. John Buckles, and three Chactahs, one of which went back with me.</p>
                           <p>29th. I arrived in the Chactah nation; and on my arrival I called all the headmen of the Chactahs together, and there delivered my meſſage: but none of the headmen of the French party would come to hear it. The talk was very agreeable to them of the Engliſh party, and they all with one conſent agreed to come down.</p>
                           <p>Auguſt 3d. I arrived in the Chicaſah nation. Two days before my arrival there, <note place="margin">A Chactah killed by the Creeks.</note> there came a Chactah fellow from the Breed camp, giving an account, that the Creeks had killed the Chactah that went to the Breed camp with Mr. Buckles, <note place="margin">The Chicaſah kill three French men, a Indian women, and take a negro boy.</note> and that he, the ſame fellow, narrowly made his eſcape. Four Chica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſahs that had been at war, and having ſtrayed from the reſt of their gang, came on a camp of people, and killed three Frenchmen and two Indian women, and took a negro boy alive.</p>

                           <p>12th. A runner came to me from the Chactahs, and acquainted me, that none of them would go down, on account of the Creeks being at war with them.</p>
                           <p>13th. This day I ſent a runner back. And on the 22d I received an anſwer, that none of them would go down, by reaſon of the Creeks killing one of their people, and threatening deſtruction to them all; and that, if they ſhould go down, it might be a detriment to their brethren the Chicaſahs, for which reaſon they referred it, and concluded to go to war, to take ſatisfaction for the man <note place="margin">The Chicaſahs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine to go to war againſt the Creeks.</note> they loſt.</p>

                  <p>THE governors and ſuperintendent obſerve with pleaſure the good diſpoſition with which you are come to this meeting,<note place="margin">Their behaviours applauded.</note> apparent in your talks and in your countenances; and the juſt ſenſe you ſhew of the great king's kind and fatherly intentions to you and all his red people and children.</p>
                  <p>In your anſwers to the talk delivered from him, you mention two points, to each of which you will now receive particular anſwers. The firſt relates to the trade carried on between the white people and your towns; the other to the lands on which the white people are ſettled. As to the trade, you have goods ſent among you by almoſt all the colonies over which we preſide;<note place="margin">Reasons why few traders go amongſt them.</note> but the prices you are inclined to give for goods are ſo ſmall, that few traders chooſe to carry goods into your towns: You muſt conſider, that if traders do not make an advantage of their goods, they will not carry them; you would do the ſame yourſelves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="36" facs="unknown:009706_0036_0F7A46760DAFDC48"/>
The trade of South Carolina ſtands on another footing.<note place="margin">And why a factory was ſettled at Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>howee.</note> At the time the path into your towns was but lately cleared from blood; to preſerve it clean, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the ſame miſchiefs from being repeated, which had been occaſioned by the madneſs of your young men, and the miſbehaviour of our traders, a factory was ſettled at Keehowee, and a trader whom we can depend upon for uſing you well eſtabliſhed there;<note place="margin">Keehowee a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and cheap place for goods.</note> plenty of goods are conſtantly kept for your ſupply, and the price as low or lower than any private trader can afford them: This regulation the province of South Carolina cannot alter, becauſe it has been laid before the king; it is in his power, and in his alone, to make an alteration; and until this is done, South-Carolina has not the power of lending private traders.</p>
                  <p>In North Carolina there are no Indian traders at all,<note place="margin">No Indian traders from North Carolina.</note> either to your nation or any other.</p>
                  <p>And as to Virginia,<note place="margin">Virginia traders at liberty to go among them or not.</note> the traders there are free to carry up their goods or not, as they find their advantage. There are no laws to compel them to go, or to<note place="margin">They cannot be compelled.</note>reſtrain them from going. Every man carries up his goods as he thinks proper, and ſets ſuch prices upon them, as he judges will anſwer his expence in carrying them up into your towns. You are alſo free to purchaſe them or not, as you approve of the prices ſet upon them. And all we have to add on this ſubject is, that the government of Virginia ſets no prices on the goods ſent up to you, but leaves you and the traders to agree upon the price in ſuch manner as is ſuitable to you both.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall now come to the other point relative to lands. You have complained of ſettlements being made on the part of Virginia to the weſtward of the New river, and deſire no further ſettlements may be made there. In order to comply ſtrictly with the great king's inſtructions, copies of which you have among you, and that we may in no ſhape deceive you, we will explain the ſtate of thoſe ſettlements.</p>
                  <p>By a former governor,<note place="margin">Lands run out explained.</note> and above twenty ſince, a large grant of lands in that part of the country was made to one col. Patten, who under that grant ſold out parcels of the land to people who ſettled there: In theſe ſettlements you have acquieſced without complaint to this time, as they are at a great diſtance from your country. Another large grant was alſo made by the great king juſt before the breaking out of the war with the French; but thoſe diſturbances prevented many perſons ſettling un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that grant,<note place="margin">No intruſion upon them made or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</note> and by the king's late inſtructions to the governor of Virginia no land can be granted even ſo far as the eaſtern banks of that river. And in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to that inſtruction not a foot has been ſince granted upon that river, ſo that you have nothing further to apprehend on that account. And we now take this opportunity to confirm you in your ſecurity, by aſſuring you, that on the return of the governor of Virginia into his colony, all treaties will be carefully examined, and punctually obſerved, and you may depend on ſtrict juſtice being done to you. It is poſſible, ſome idle perſons may ſit down on lands without any authority whatever:
<note place="margin">Any idle people ſettling upon them to be removed on complaint made.</note> But this you ought not to conſider as an act of the government, which does not nor ever will countenance and protect people ſettling in that manner, but heartily concur with you in removing them on complaint made by you to the governor for that purpoſe.</p>

                     <p>The removal of the French and Spaniards from the ceded places, which your lordſhip meant the Indians ſhould be apprized of by us, they were before ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with; this was unavoidable; the diſpatching of invitations to nations ſo remote as the Chactahs and Chicaſahs, neceſſarily took up a great deal of time, their conſultations upon them not much leſs, and their journey hither ſtill more; however, my lord, we do not apprehend, that their receiving the above intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence from other hands has been detrimental to the king's ſervice. The Chica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſahs, ever faithful to the Britiſh intereſt, are perfectly ſatisfied with the change. The Chactah leader, now in confederacy with the Chicaſahs, had before made repeated offers of declaring againſt the French, provided he was ſupplied with Engliſh goods; and ſeems well pleaſed with the neighbourhood of the Engliſh, whoſe aſſiſtance he had before courted: We have, in our reply to him, given him reaſon to expect, that, by the time he reaches home, there will be traders in his nation by the way of Mobile; and we beg leave to recommend to your lordſhip, that the Chactahs be ſupplied with goods from that quarter, as a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure neceſſary to confirm them in their preſent profeſſions, and to render them independent of the Creeks, againſt whom they may be a very uſeful check when their ſupplies are no longer ſo precarious, as they now are by paſſing through the Creek country. The Creeks had been repreſented to be very ill diſpoſed, the murders they had committed were frequent, and even ſubſequent to the receipt of your lordſhip's letter; and even ſince the holding of the congreſs, though amply ſupplied with proviſion, they have been accuſed of wantonly killing the people's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet their talks have been more friendly than we expected, and their voluntary offer of an augmentation of boundary to Georgia, upon the king's forgivenneſs of all paſt injuries being ſignified to them, ſuppoſing their profeſſions ſincere, and the chiefs of conſequence enough to act for the whole nation, which they declare they do, is certainly as ſtrong a proof as they can at preſent give of their good-will, it will be neceſſary, however, to mention to your lordſhip, that we have been privately cautioned, by the leader of the Chicaſahs, againſt confiding in the Creek profeſſions; he ſays he knows them, that nothing done here will be confirmed by the abſent leaders, in compariſon of whom the preſent chiefs are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable: The Cherokees, in their intelligence, have gone ſtill farther, but as they ſeem on the point of a war with the Creeks, their teſtimony is to be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. Though the talks will convey to your lordſhip our opinions of the 
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:009706_0043_0F7A467C0392C798"/>
different diſpoſitions or the Indians, yet we thought neceſſary to add thus much, and to acquaint your lordſhip, that the Cherokees ſeem very pacific, but morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied at the refuſal of traders from South-Carolina, which the act now in force there prevents their being gratified with. And we beg leave to obſerve to your lordſhip on this head, that the general promiſe of goods which we have made, by the king's orders, to the reſpective Indians, requires ſuch a performance as it is impoſſible, circumſtanced as we are, to be anſwerable for, for we have no coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive power over traders. Your lordſhip will pardon us for ſuggeſting, that there never was a time more ſeaſonable, for the eſtabliſhing the commerce with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, upon a general, ſafe, equitable footing, and which we are afraid will never be done by reſpective provinces. The Catawbas boundary as before agreed upon, is now confirmed, and they are well ſatisfied with it. Permit us to refer your lordſhip, for all further particulars of the congreſs, to the original papers which we ſhall have the honour of tranſmitting with the utmoſt diſpatch, and to hope that we have faithfully executed the king's commands, and approved ourſelves,</p>
