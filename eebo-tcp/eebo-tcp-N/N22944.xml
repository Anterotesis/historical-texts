            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>IT is propoſed to examine a little more the pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet made up, in <hi>England,</hi> by the republicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the eſſays of Publicola, aſcribed to Mr. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams, jun. and printed as from <hi>America,</hi> with the name of <hi>John Adams, Eſquire,</hi> in the title page.</p>
               <p>There is one paſſage in the pamphlet under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, which merits particular notice. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as it was written in 1791, when our preſent government was formed, it will appear to be a ſtrong and decided proteſt againſt the manner in which the federal conſtitution was actually accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed. It is in the twenty-fourth page, and runs thus: "If however," ſays our author, ſpeaking of a call of a convention by the Britiſh parliament, <q>we can ſuppoſe, that the parliament ſhould final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accede to the idea, that they are mere tyrants without the ſhadow of a right to the authority, which they have hitherto exerciſed; the only act which they could agree to, would be a vote to diſſolve themſelves, and leave the veſſel of the ſtate without either a pilot or a rudder.

               </p>
               <p>It is not our wiſh to adviſe <hi>for</hi> or <hi>againſt</hi> any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which regards the internal affairs of <hi>another</hi> country. It is only becauſe the papers of Publicola were offered to <hi>American</hi> conſideration, with a view, no doubt, to the adoption of the ideas they contain, that we obſerve upon them. Where they imply a condemnation of <hi>our</hi> meaſures to obtain this happy conſtitution, it is very fit and neceſſary that they be noticed with all our minds and with all our ſtrength.</p>
               <p>It is well known, that there was no authority in the <hi>Annapolis</hi> convention of 1786, to proceed upon any buſineſs, other than <hi>commercial.</hi> Yet they unanimouſly recommended to the ſtates, which had delegated them, to call another convention for <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> objects. This was done. The convention met at Philadelphia. The inſtrument, under which we enjoy our preſent happineſs, was formed by them, and the old confederated congreſs of 1787, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated the propoſed conſtitution to the ſtates, though one of its proviſions was contrary to the old articles of confederation—that, we mean, which ſet up a new confederation of nine adopting ſtates. It was, however, communicated to the ſtate legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and <hi>they all called conventions of the people to conſider, reject, or adopt it,</hi> though it is certain, that no ſtate conſtitution contained a power to take ſuch a meaſure. The people, however, did chooſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, and adopted the conſtitution at various times, from December 1787, until May 1790. The operation took almoſt three years, excluſively of the later caſe of Vermont, which was peculiarly circumſtanced.

               </p>
               <p>The ſymptoms and evidences of the real writer of the pamphlet referred to, we have already given. It is not at all doubted, that <hi>Publicola's</hi> eſſays, of which it is made up, are the work of Mr. Adams, jun. Nothing in the public or private character of this gentleman is known, which is a ſubject of cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. If there were any thing of that nature, <hi>it could have no place here.</hi> Some of the political ideas in the pamphlet appear to correſpond with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to hereditary government, evidenced or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified by an approbation of, and ſolicitude for, the Britiſh conſtitution, which has been ſtated as the <hi>great objection</hi> to the election of Mr. Adams.</p>
               <p>The teſtimony of Mr. Paine on the ſubject of Mr. Adams's ſentiments or diſpoſitions, ſo far as it may weigh with the electors, cannot, it is true, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as <hi>direct.</hi> He ſpeaks only of what he has been informed of from ſuch ſources as to fix his own belief. It is, however, a circumſtance of weight, taken in connection with what has been exhibited from Mr. Adams's books, with the contents of the "Diſcourſes upon <hi>Davila,"</hi> and with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

Mr. Paine's aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, that he has the authority of one or two perſons, for ſaying that Mr. Adams has declared, that <hi>the preſidency</hi> ſhould be made <hi>hereditary,</hi> in the family of Mr. Lund Waſhington. It is true, that the manner in which Mr. Paine has ſtated this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is ſuch as not to give all poſſible effect to the aſſertion. But though there may be wanting ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that ſerious ſimplicity of narrative or ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of facts, which aids the impreſſion, even of truth itſelf, yet the aſſertion is perfectly expreſs and clear, and it completely commits Mr. Paine. He may occaſionally be eccentric or extravagant, as men of great powers of language, animation, and genius not ſeldom are; but there appears no reaſon to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that he would give under his hand a wilful miſrepreſentation of fact, concerning an important ſubject, and relative to a public officer of high ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It is now four or five weeks ſince this aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was publiſhed in the gazettes. The circumſtance really was very favorable to Mr. Adams, as it afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him an opportunity to ſhew the community, that this and all other opinions or aſſertions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a predilection for hereditary power were untrue. When the anxieties of a virtuous community are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened, it is no leſs <hi>reaſonable</hi> than <hi>prudent,</hi> that they ſhould be removed by the exertions of all who can contribute to that end. But when they have particular relation to individuals, the attention to the anxieties of the community is rarely with-held, when it is in their power. Reſpect to the public feelings and ſolicitudes ought to produce all the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of that nature, which circumſtances will admit. The general inferences from ſilence are <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>irreſiſtible,</hi> and <hi>nothing</hi> occurs, that can dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh their force in the preſent caſe.</p>

Such an aſſertion concerning Mr. Adams has been in circulation for two years. It is known as well to the ſupporters as to the opponents of Mr. Adams. The influence of the opinion of its truth has long been, and now is, very conſiderable indeed. Being really known to the ſupporters of Mr. Adams, and, of courſe, to that gentleman himſelf, and there being no uſe whatever made of the long interval between its origination and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time, to remove the impreſſion and relieve the great anxiety and diſſatisfaction it produced in the public mind, the report remains to this hour in a ſtate of confirmation from the ſilence. It is an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute truth, that perſons, who had ſupported Mr. Adams's former elections, and who, according to every appearance, might have been willing to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port him again, have become ſincerely and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſolicitous for ſome other candidate.</p>
               <p>This very ſerious report of what was ſaid to thoſe ſenators, has occaſioned an alarm, which can never be allayed or ſuppreſſed, without the obvious and natural ſatisfaction, which ſo very important a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter requires.

               <p>IT would be a vain attempt to baniſh party from any government, arbitrary or free. The object of the prudent and the virtuous will ever be, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to mitigate the ſpirit, and to check its exceſſes and exaggerations. Party has ariſen to a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able height in the United States. <hi>Our well and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly balanced government,</hi> in which our preſident has applied his qualified negative oftener than <hi>the five laſt Britiſh monarchs,</hi> and in which the two houſes have negatived each other with an independent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, has kept us in order in a difficult and trying ſeaſon, and in a time of general agitation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion under monarchy in Europe. It is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable truth, that our various partizans have much miſrepreſented each other to their reſpective conſtituents, in a prejudiced and angry manner. Theſe circumſtances have very much contributed to the materials which Phocion has wrought up into his eſſays and pamphlet. A curſory notice of ſome facts and events, which have occurred in America, may tend to produce harmony and to remove preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices. Time, however, admits but little to be done to this uſeful end. It is certain and manifeſt, that <hi>the exciſe ſyſtem</hi> of revenue has been the moſt trying meaſure of the general government. Prejudice againſt it exiſted in many places, and from ſever<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <pb n="18" facs="unknown:030294_0018_0FE5AA4780170688"/>cauſes. It therefore behoved the true and prudent friends of the government, not to diſcountenance a mode of revenue, which <hi>a war</hi> would have render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed neceſſary to us, and which we have been obliged to uſe in peace. The inevitable difficulties were of themſelves too great. It is <hi>a fact,</hi> little known, that <hi>all</hi> the <hi>ſenators</hi> of North Carolina, South Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolina, and Virginia, voted for the paſſing of the bill, while three of the ſenators of the eaſtern ſtates voted againſt it, including <hi>both</hi> of thoſe from Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts. It muſt be added, that Mr. Jefferſon's particular friends in the ſenate, voted for the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. A ſimilar ſupport to the exciſe law took place in the other houſe, on the part of the ableſt and moſt influential friends of Mr. Jefferſon.</p>
               <p>The act of congreſs moſt important to <hi>the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency</hi> of the executive power, is that which enables the preſident to remove the officers of the executive government at his diſcretion. In proportion to the number of members in the houſe of repreſentatives, the votes from the ſouthward of Pennſylvania were more numerous than from the northward, and the names of Mr. Jefferſon's ableſt friends will alſo be found among the voters for this important act. Of ſuch magnitude is the law, that it is now greatly to be deſired that an amendment to the conſtitution, ſecuring the power to the preſident for ever, might be adopted. By ſtrengthening our elective chief we diminiſh the pleas for making him <hi>hereditary.</hi>

               <p>The ſubject of <hi>boundary</hi> was predicted by the malignant enemies of American union and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, as an abundant ſource of diſcord and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. Virginia had the oldeſt charter, and a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry broad one indeed. Yet ſhe has ſettled amicably with North Carolina, Maryland, and Pennſylvania, the great queſtions of boundary, conceding what ther ſtates maintain to this day in their favor.</p>

                  <hi>Connecticut</hi> alone has kept open <hi>one point</hi> with Pennſylvania, and <hi>another</hi> with <hi>New York.</hi> It may be affirmed, without the leaſt hazard, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal peace and harmony of this country has, <hi>in no inſtance,</hi> been ſo <hi>lightly</hi> hazarded as by the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Connecticut, in ſelling, for a few thouſand pounds, a claim to a quantity of valuable land, reckoned little ſhort of a million and a half of acres, in the ſtate of New York. If they had a right to it, <hi>deep, very deep</hi> indeed, has been the injury to their <hi>conſtituents.</hi> Becauſe the property is intrinſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally worth three or four millions of dollars. If they had <hi>not</hi> the right, the act of ſelling it comes under a <hi>denomination,</hi> which <hi>we forbear to name.</hi> It is important to obſerve, that the tranſaction took place in the laſt year.</p>
               <p>No diſpoſition to good government is admitted to exiſt in the ſouthern ſtates. Yet two eaſtern ſtates out of four, rejected the conſtitution in the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and of the four ſouthern ſtates only one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected. There was no inſtance of unanimity in adopting the conſtitution to the eaſtward. But Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey, Delaware, and Georgia, were unanimous, and the minority in Maryland was leſs than that of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut, <hi>the moſt unanimous</hi> eaſtern ſtate, being in Maryland only eleven.</p>
               <p>It is urged againſt ſome of the ſouthern ſtates, that they impeded the payment of debts, which the treaty of peace ſecured to the ſubjects of Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. It is, however, ſome extenuation, if the plea is inſufficient, that they pleaded the infraction of the treaty of 1783, concerning their negroes. And it is true, though little known, that Connecticut, without ſuch a plea, was found to have in full force in 1790, a law which, alſo interfering then on the ſcorce of debts with the treaty, was ſet aſide by the ſupreme court of the United States. It is alſo true, that the inſurrection of 1786, in Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:030294_0020_0FE5AA4DB2727590"/>was, in a great degree, owing to the operation of the courts of law, which, of courſe, decreed the payment of private debts to the creditor citizens from the debtor citizens of the ſame ſtate: not to perſons lately <hi>alien enemies,</hi> againſt whoſe govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a breach of treaty was alleged. The courts of law were declared by the inſurgents to be griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, and their ſuppreſſion was required. It has been ſaid that the ſouthern ſtates were indiſpoſed to the funding ſyſtem; but have they not paſſed laws to raiſe impoſts and even exciſes to diſcharge the intereſt and ſink the principal? Virginia, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, has paid the exciſe, <hi>on the produce of her ſoil,</hi> in an <hi>examplary</hi> manner, and to a large amount. If the tempers of ſome, and the very low ſales of their certificates by others, have occaſioned loud com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, have the ſame not appeared in the ſhape of inſurrection, in the ſtate of Maſſachuſetts?—It is well known that the payment of the public debt was among the chief cauſes of the inſurrection of 1786.</p>
               <p>Believe me, reſpectable fellow citizens, it is not to <hi>cenſure,</hi> not <hi>to raiſe a clamor</hi> againſt the eaſtern ſtates, that theſe things are mentioned; but, <hi>by ſelf-examination,</hi> to produce convictions of truth, and to renovate that <hi>"ſpirit of amity and mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion"</hi> which prevailed, alas, more in 1787, 1788, and 1789, than it has done for the laſt four years. Let us proceed to other facts.</p>
               <p>Much has been repreſented upon the ſubject of Mr. Jefferſon and the late printer of the National Gazette. It has been proved, upon the oath of Mr. Freneau, that there was no foundation for the idea of a connection or influence with or from Mr. Jef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferſon. This is abſolutely true. It has not been candidly laid before you. If Mr. Jefferſon meant to ſupport Mr. Freneau, it is extraordinary that he did not allow him the whole ſum of five hundred
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:030294_0021_0FE5AA4F429FA180"/>dollars per annum, when the legiſlature aſſigned that ſum for a clerkſhip, and when the linguiſt [Mr. Freneau] was obliged to procure tranſlations of <hi>Spaniſh, Portugueſe, German, Low-Dutch, Italian,</hi> or <hi>any</hi> other foreign papers, the department of ſtate might receive. It is doubted whether a man of equal talents could be obtained, for five hundred dollars, now.</p>
               <p>Why is it mentioned, that not only Mr Jefferſon, but a clerk, before in the office, underſtood <hi>French?</hi> Are there no other foreign languages but <hi>French,</hi> and could Mr. Jefferſon apply <hi>a ſecreiary's</hi> time to make tranſlations, which, it was known, the preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent would want, being unacquainted with the French? Other gentlemen of the executive govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who did not underſtand French, were to be conſulted on many affairs. To them alſo tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were neceſſary, as they likewiſe were for the two houſes of congreſs, and for promulgation to our citizens. If another clerk underſtood <hi>French,</hi> did he underſtand <hi>all</hi> other foreign languages?— was he <hi>critically</hi> well acquainted with <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French?</hi>—Though before in the office, had he not his time and talents fully employed in his proper buſineſs?</p>
               <p>The repreſentations concerning the caſe of Mr. Freneau, were ſo frequent and open in the gazettes, that it muſt have been known to the preſident. It cannot be doubted, that the affair was a ſubject of converſation between him and Mr. Jefferſon. If the preſident thought there was a propriety in Mr. Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neau's removal, or a neceſſity for it, he would <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly</hi> have ſaid ſo to the ſecretary of ſtate, and Mr. Jefferſon would <hi>as certainly</hi> have removed him on the preſident's wiſh. <hi>This ought to be concluſive with every man,</hi> and particularly with ſuch a writer as Phocion, who ſtudies to carry an appearance of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference and attachment to the chief magiſtrate. But,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:030294_0022_0FE5AAC15D39AC98"/>as in regard to opinions <hi>concerning French affaris,</hi> ſo in <hi>this caſe,</hi> the preſident himſelf has been inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately implicated in cenſure, to get at Mr. Jef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferſon. It would be frivolous to ſay, the preſident <hi>could not cauſe the diſmiſſion of a tranſlating clerk.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is with the greateſt regret; that we touch upon foreign topies, <hi>even in reply,</hi> but Phocion has made it neceſſary. It will be remembered, that Mr. Jefferſon was in France, when the meaſures of the firſt nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al aſſembly were taken. He ſaw the daily evidences of that enmity to the French revolution, which the deſpotic part of the combined powers manifeſted in 1788 and 1789, on account of the admiſſion of <hi>the French people,</hi> or <hi>tiers clat,</hi> into a ſhare of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. He ſaw, that the idea of a reform, <hi>in any degree through the agency of the people,</hi> excited the paſſions and exertions of the hereditary orders. He ſaw thoſe orders, headed by the blood relations of the king and queen of France, preparing to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in the internal affairs of France, and ultimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly threatening <hi>a partition</hi> of the kingdom, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the eſtabliſhment of any degree or portion of power in the people of France, as <hi>a part of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular order in Europe.</hi> He muſt have ſeen that the deſtruction of the power of the people in France, naturally led to ſimilar vies in regard to America. Such were the <hi>natural</hi> reflexions of Americans, diſpoſed to ſupport popular elective government, in theſe ſtates. If the <hi>proteſtant</hi> cauſe from 1755 to 1760, intereſted the freeſt of the civilized nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in the ſucceſs of the arbitrary princes who ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported it by their arms, as in the caſe of the laſt Pruſſian king, how natural was it to feel an intereſt in the ſucceſs of the French ſtruggle, which was maintained by hereditary deſpotic monarchs, againſt <hi>the new-born power of the people of Europe</hi> in the Gallic inſtance? It was manifeſt that the Americans, their conſtitution and their government, which are
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:030294_0023_0FE5AA5118292A58"/>
                  <hi>inſeparable,</hi> were intereſted, at leaſt, by prudence and policy, not to ſay by feeling.</p>
               <p>Such was the ſtate and courſe of things till 1793. No man can doubt <hi>the unity of opinion</hi> between <hi>the preſident</hi> and <hi>Mr. Jefferſon,</hi> which prevailed on French affairs. At that time a French agent, as little the friend of France as of America in his diplomatic conduct, gave this country the moſt juſt and ſerious cauſes of offence and uneaſineſs. Mr. Jefferſon muſt have been very early ſtruck with the extravagance and danger of Mr. Genet's conduct, for the firſt communication to that miniſter, from the ſecretary of ſtate, which was within a very few days after his arrival at the ſeat of government, clearly proves that Mr. Jefferſon decidedly and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly reſiſted the irregular and dangerous preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Mr. Genet. Theſe papers were officially communicated to the legiſlature by the preſident. Mr. Genet's firſt communication was of the 27th of May, and Mr. Jefferſon's reply was of the 5th of June. It appears from the latter, that he had <hi>before</hi> made an oral communication to Mr. Genet. In both theſe we ſee that Mr. Jefferſon had, in a conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liating, though a firm, explicit, and decided man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, maintained the independent rights and neutral duties of this government and nation. Theſe very decided and early communications, Phocion has carefully omitted, and only brings into view a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent communication to Mr. Governeur Morris, dated above ten weeks after, the firm ſpirit of which he endeavors to undervalue. This material omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Phocion juſtifies the pointed repetition of the remark, that he is a very prejudiced, and conſequently, a very deceiving and dangerous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant.</p>
               <p>It merits the particular conſideration of the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, that the duty Mr. Jefferſon had to perform,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:030294_0024_0FE5AA6A5A499D40"/>on this occaſion, was infinitely delicate and import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant. He knew that the preſident was as earneſt in his wiſhes for the ſucceſs of the French revolution, as a decided whig in a neutral chief magiſtracy, could poſſibly be. He moſt probably knew, too, that a republican common intereſt was perceived be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two countries, by the preſident—and the ſame impreſſion exiſted, no doubt, in his own mind. He knew that France was under a highly-excited revolutionary government and feeling, and that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary ſupplies and officers were engaged in France, and commiſſions of congreſs iſſued, and prizes ſold, in the French dominions, before the war of 1778, with England. Theſe were all contrary to the law of nations—ſubjected France to war, and would ſubject the United States. Though the French Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public might feel much therefore, the United States could not conſent to ſuch proceedings in their actual ſituation. The French agent was very extravagant in his language, and diſorderly, to an extreme, in his conduct. This could not be endur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; yet, a quarrel with France, was ſtudiouſly to be avoided; becauſe it would throw us into the arms of the combined monarchs, with whom we had <hi>no common feeling</hi>—no common <hi>intereſt</hi>—no ground, however ſlight, of common cauſe. This government, impreſſed with real friendſhip towards France, under the circumſtances ſtated, had to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, in a dignified manner, againſt the agent of that republic. It behoved us to take ground, which its own perfect ſoundneſs, and our arguments and firmneſs ſhould render impregnable. Let any man impreſſed with theſe views of the ſubject, examine Mr. Jefferſon's thirteen official letters, of June and July, 1793, to Mr. Genet, and let him alſo take up Mr. Jefferſon's letter (following thoſe) of the 16th Auguſt to Mr. Governeur Morris, and he will

So com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely was this done, that Mr. Genet has never ſince returned to France. No ſooner had theſe very difficult and painful ſcenes been well gone through, than the Britiſh order, againſt our trade, of June 1793, came forth and ſhewed us how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle it would have done for us to have been driven by a quarrel with France into the arms of England. While the agitations and injuries from thoſe orders were embarraſſing the buſineſs of the department of ſtate and the commerce of the country, a new and more alarming ſcene was opened before us. The ſchemes of the combined powers were extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. An explicit manifeſto of Great Britain of the 31ſt October 1793, was publiſhed, in which <hi>monarchical</hi> government was dictated to the French republic; and <hi>this only other republic upon earth,</hi> by virtue of an accompanying <hi>ſecret</hi> order of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh government, nearly of the ſame date (Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 6th, 1793) was to be ſacrificed, without notice, in its commerce, navigation, ſeamen, mercantile capital, ſupplies, and revenues. Yes, reſpectable electors, <hi>one</hi> of theſe republics was expreſsly to be <hi>ſubverted,</hi> and the <hi>other</hi> to be <hi>ruinouſly crippled and deranged</hi> by virtue of two acts, <hi>matured at the ſame time,</hi> and no doubt <hi>in due connexion,</hi> upon <hi>the ſame foreign council board!</hi> Theſe things are not repeated to inflame. But if a ſecretary of ſtate, who dealt firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with a groſsly offending foreign miniſter of that other republic, under ſuch trying circumſtances, is to ſuſtain <hi>imputed infamy,</hi> inſtead of imputed merit, from the pen of a ſelf-deceiving witneſs, it behoves us carefully to look back to the ſerious tranſaction
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:030294_0026_0FE5AAC315C73200"/>of the time. It is manifeſted to you, by our eleventh number, that the preſident has retained in <hi>his</hi> mind, the ſtrongeſt attachment to the principles of the French revolution, notwithſtanding all the miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of their agents. National intereſts are not altered by miniſterial errors or crimes. Mr. Jeffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon has done no more than the preſident. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrations of Phocion, on this account, are clearly implied execrations of both, for a judicious poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and moderation, by which the wildneſs of the ſons of Gallic LIBERTY, was not permitted to impair their wonted attachment to the revered PARENT.</p>

               <p>IT is manifeſt, that theſe additional pages can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly reach all the electors. Impediments of various kinds, not within the controul of the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, have prevented their being more early and much more full. The eſſays of Phocion carry evident marks of the preparation of years. Yet they ſeem to be more open to a complete refutation than any publication on ſo important a ſubject, which has ever been produced in America, from the palpable miſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and omiſſions of great matters of fact. The minuteneſs and diffuſion with which they are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, would render a detailed anſwer to him equally long. What he may propoſe to publiſh in defence of Mr. Adams's opinions in his pamphlet copy, we do not know; but we perceive that he has left his obſer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <p>Should he add no more in regard to that all-impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant object of our inveſtigation, we preſume it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he perceives the difficulty of the taſk. If he ſhould add more in the pamphlet than he ſubjects, in his eſſays, to general examination, it will evince a deſire to avoid the diſcuſſion.
