            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <hi>SUCH</hi> is the Malignity of Man's Nature in his <hi>fallen State,</hi> and ſo averſe is he from walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the <hi>ſtraight</hi> and <hi>even Path</hi> of <hi>TRUTH,</hi> that at every Turn he is inclinable to lean either to the Right-hand or to the Left; yea, ſuch as by the Work of God's Grace in their Hearts, and powerful Operation of his Spirit, have obtained an Entrance in this Way, are daily moleſted, and ſet upon on all Hands; ſome ſtriving to draw them the one Way, ſome ſhe other: And if through the Power of God they be kept <hi>faithful</hi> and <hi>ſtable,</hi> then are they ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated on both Sides; each likening or compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to the Worſt of their Enemies.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that are acquainted with the <hi>Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> may obſerve this to be the Lot of the Saints in all Ages; but eſpecially thoſe, whoſe Place it hath been to <hi>reform</hi> and <hi>reſtore</hi> the Ruins of the Houſe of God, when decayed, or any conſiderable Time have been liable to ſuch Cenſures: Hence thoſe that ſet about repairing of the Walls of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> were neceſſitated to work with the one Hand, and defend with the other.</p>

Chriſt is accuſed of the <hi>Jews</hi> as a <hi>Samaritan;</hi> and by the <hi>Samaritans</hi> quarrelled for being a <hi>Jew.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> is whipped and impriſoned by the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and upbraided with being a <hi>Jew,</hi> and teaching their Cuſtoms; the ſame <hi>Paul</hi> is hawled, and ready to be killed by the <hi>Jews,</hi> for breaking the Law, and defiling the Temple with the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> The like hath alſo befallen theſe <hi>faithful Witneſſes</hi> and <hi>Meſſengers,</hi> whom God has raiſed up in this Day to witneſs for his Truth, which hath long been in a great Meaſure hid; but now is again revealed, and many brought to be Witneſſes of it, who thereby are come to <hi>walk in the Light of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This People thus gathered, have not wanted thoſe Trials, that uſually accompany the Church of Chriſt, both on the Right-hand, and on the Left, each cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racterizing them in ſuch Terms, as they have judged would prove moſt to their Diſadvantage. From whence (as the Teſtimony of the falſe Witneſſes againſt our Lord did not agree neither do theſe againſt us) ſome will have us to be <hi>fooliſh, mad Creatures;</hi> others to be <hi>deep, ſubtil Politicians;</hi> ſome to be <hi>illiterate, ignorant Fellows;</hi> others to be <hi>learned, cunning Jeſuits,</hi> under a meer Vizard: Divers Profeſſors will have us to be only <hi>Penſioners of the Pope,</hi> undoubtedly <hi>Papiſts;</hi> but the Papiſts abhor us as <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks:</hi> Sometimes we are a <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly, confuſed Rabble,</hi> leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every one to do as they liſt, againſt all good <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;</hi> at other Times we <note n="*" place="margin">John Owen <hi>charges us with ſo much Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that tho' he writes againſt us in</hi> Latin, <hi>he fears we will not underſtand it. And</hi> Thomas Danſen <hi>about the ſame time accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes us of being</hi> Jeſuits, <hi>ſent from abroad under this Vizard.</hi>

are ſo much for Order, as we admit not Men to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe the Liberty of their own Judgments. Thus are our Reputations toſſed by the Envy of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries; which yet cannot but have this Effect upon ſober-minded People, as to ſee what MALICE works againſt us; and how theſe Men, by their contradictory Aſſertions concerning us, ſave us the Pains, while they <hi>refute one another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>True it is, we have laboured to walk amidſt theſe Extremities; and upon our appearing for the Truth, we have found Things <hi>good</hi> in themſelves <hi>abuſed</hi> on both Hands: For ſuch hath always been the Work of an <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> to keep up the <hi>Shadow</hi> of certain <hi>Truths;</hi> that there-through they might ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter other <hi>Evils.</hi> Thus the <hi>Jews</hi> made uſe of the Law and the Prophets to vindicate their <hi>Abuſes;</hi> yea, and to crucify <hi>Chriſt:</hi> And how much many <hi>Chriſtians</hi> abuſe the <hi>Scriptures</hi> and the <hi>Traditions</hi> of the Apoſtles, to uphold Things quite contrary to them, will in the General be readily acknowledged by moſt.</p>
            <p>But to deſcend more particularly; There be <hi>two Things</hi> eſpecially, both of which in their primitive Uſe were appointed; and did very much contribute towards the Edification of the Church: The one is,</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>The Power and Authority, which the Apoſtles had given them of Chriſt, for the gathering, building up, and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Church; by Virtue of which Power and Authority they alſo wrote the Holy Scriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. The other is, <hi>That Privilege given to every Chriſtian under the Goſpel, to be led and guided by the Spirit of Chriſt, and to be taught thereof in all Things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="unknown:007840_0005_102DB567674A3E28"/>
Now, both theſe in the Primitive-Church wrought effectually towards the ſame End of <hi>Edification;</hi> and did (as in their Nature they may, and in their, Uſe they ought to do) in a good Harmony very well conſiſt together: But by the Workings of Satan, and Perverſeneſs of Men, they are made to fight againſt and deſtroy one another. For on the one Hand the <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> that reſided in the Apoſtles, while it is annexed and entailed to an outward Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination and Succeſſion of Teachers, is made Uſe of to cloak and cover all Manner of Abuſes, even the Height of <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Superſtition.</hi> For by Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of this Succeſſion theſe Men claiming the like <hi>Infallibility,</hi> that was in the Apoſtles (though they be Strangers to any inward Work or Manifeſtation of the Spirit in their Hearts) will needs oblige all others to acquieſce and agree to their <hi>Concluſions,</hi> however different from, or contrary to, the Truths of the Goſpel; and yet for any to call ſuch Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in Queſtion, or examine them, is no leſs than a <hi>heinous Hereſy,</hi> deſerving <hi>Death,</hi> &amp;c. Or while the Revelation of God's Mind is wholly bound up to theſe Things already delivered in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures (as if God had ſpoke his <hi>laſt Words</hi> there to his People) we are put with our own <hi>natural Underſtandings</hi> to debate about the Meanings of them, and forced to interpret them, not as they plainly ſpeak, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Analogy of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Faith made by Men, not ſo much contrived to anſwer the Scriptures, as the Scriptures are ſtrained to vindicate it; which to doubt of, is alſo counted <hi>Hereſy,</hi> deſerving no leſs <note n="*" place="margin">

than Election out of our native Country, and to be robbed of the common Aid our Nativity entitles us to. And on this Hand, we may boldly ſay, both <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants</hi> have greatly gone aſide.</p>
            <p>On the other Hand, ſome are ſo great Pretenders to <hi>inward Motions</hi> and <hi>Revelations of the Spirit,</hi> that there are no Extravagancies ſo wild, which they will not cloak with them; and ſo much are they for every One's following their own Mind, as can admit of no <hi>Chriſtian Fellowſhip</hi> and <hi>Community,</hi> nor of that good <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> which the Church of Chriſt never was, nor can be without. This gives an open Door to all <hi>Libertiniſm,</hi> and brings great Reproach to the Chriſtian Faith. And on this Hand have foully fallen the <hi>German Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts,</hi> ſo called, <hi>John of Leyden, Knipperdolling,</hi> &amp;c. (in Caſe theſe monſtrous Things committed by them be ſuch as they are related) and ſome more moderate of that Kind have been found among the People in <hi>England,</hi> called <hi>Ranters:</hi> As it is true, the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> have been branded with both of theſe Extreams; it is as true, it hath been and is their Work to avoid them; and to be found in that even and good Path of the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> where all were (no doubt) led and acted by the Holy Spirit; and might all have <hi>propheſied one by one;</hi> and yet there was a <hi>Subjection of the Prophets to the Spirits of the Prophets.</hi> There was an <hi>Authority</hi> ſome had in the Church, and yet it was for <hi>Edification,</hi> and not for <hi>Deſtruction:</hi> There was an <hi>Obedience in the Lord</hi> to ſuch as were ſet over; and a being taught by ſuch, and et a knowing of the <hi>inward Anointing,</hi> by which ach Individual was to be led into all Truth.

                  <note place="margin">The End of the Law and Beginning of the Goſpel-Diſpenſation recited.</note> AFTER that the Lord God in his own appointed Time had ſeen meet to put an End to the Diſpenſation of the Law, which was delivered to the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of <hi>Moſes;</hi> through and by whom he did communicate unto them in the Wilderneſs from Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> divers Commandments, Ordinances, Appointments and Obſervations, according as they are teſtified in the Writings of the Law; it pleaſed him to ſend his own Son the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in the Fulneſs of Time; who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving perfectly fulfilled the Law, and the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs thereof, gave Witneſs to the Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the Goſpel. And having approved himſelf, and the Excellency of his Doctrine, by
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:007840_0009_102DB56B93FED5E0"/>
many great and wonderful Signs and Miracles, he ſealed it with his Blood; and triumphing over Death (of which it was impoſſible for him to be held) he cheriſhed and encouraged his deſpiſed Witneſſes, who had believed in him, in that he appeared to them, after he was raiſed from the Dead; comforting them with the Hope and Aſſurance of the <hi>pouring forth of his Spirit,</hi> by which they were to be led and ordered in all Things; in and by which, he was to be with them to the End of the World, not ſuffering the Gates of Hell to prevail againſt them. By which Spirit come upon them, they being filled, were emboldned to preach the Goſpel without Fear; and, in a ſhort Time, Thouſands were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Church; and the Multitude of them that believed, were of one Heart, and of one Soul, and great Love and Zeal prevailed, and there was nothing lacking for a Seaſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The divers Sorts of them that were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Apoſtles Days.</note> But all that were caught in the Net, did not prove good and wholeſome Fiſh; ſome were again to be caſt into that Ocean, from whence they were drawn: Of thoſe many that were called, all proved not choſen Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, fit for the Maſter's Uſe; and of all that were brought into the great Supper and Marriage of the King's Son, there were that were found without the Wedding-Garment.—Some made a ſhew for a Seaſon, and afterwards fell away; there were that drew back; there were that made Shipwreck of Faith, and of a good Conſcience: There were not only ſuch as did backſlide themſelves, but ſought to draw
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:007840_0010_102DB5AEC42320B8"/>
others into the ſame Perdition with themſelves, ſeeking to overturn their Faith alſo; yea, there were that brought in damnable Hereſies, even denying the Lord that bought them. And alſo of thoſe Members that became not wholly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt (for ſome were never again reſtored by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance) there were that were weak, and ſickly, and young; ſome were to be fed with Milk, and not with ſtrong Meat; ſome were to be purged, when the old Leaven received any Place; and ſome to be cut off for a Seaſon, to be ſhut out (as it were) of the Camp for a Time, until their Leproſy was healed, and then to be received in again.</p>
               <p>Moreover, as to <hi>Outwards,</hi> there was the Care of the Poor, of the Widow, of the Fatherleſs, of the Strangers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">The Order in the Church of God in the Outward.</note> who is the Head of the Body, the Church (for the Church is the Body of Chriſt, and the Saints are the ſeveral Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that Body) knowing in his infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, what was needful for the good ordering and diſpoſing all Things in their proper Place, and for preſerving and keeping all Things in their right Station, did, in the Diſpenſation and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of his Holy Spirit, miniſter unto every Member, a <hi>Meaſure of the ſame Spirit,</hi> yet diverſe according to Operation, for the Edification of the Body; ſome Apoſtles, ſome Teachers, ſome Paſtors, ſome Elders: There are old Men, there are young Men, there are Babes. For all are not Apoſtles, neither are all Elders, neither are all Babes; yet are all Members: And as ſuch,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:007840_0011_102DB56D1D487D90"/>
all have a Senſe and Feeling of the Life of the Body, which, from the Head, flows unto all the Body, <hi>as the Ointment of</hi> Aaron<hi>'s Beard, unto the Skirts of his Garment:</hi> And every Member has its Place and Station in the Body, ſo long as it keeps in the Life of the Body; and all have need one of another; yet is no Member to aſſume another Place in the Body, than God has given it; nor yet to grudge or repine its follow Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber's Place; but to be content with its own: For the uncomely Parts are no leſs needful than the comely; and the leſs honourable than the more honourable; which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> holds forth in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. from Verſe 13 to 30.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Ground of Rents and Diviſions.</note> Now the Ground of all Schiſms, Diviſions or Rents in the Body is, when as any Member aſſumes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Place than is allotted it; or being gone from the Life and Unity of the Body, and loſing the Senſe of it, lets in the Murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the Eye that watches for Evil, and not in holy Care over its Fellow Members: And then, inſtead of coming down to <hi>Judgment in itſelf,</hi> will ſtand up and <hi>judge its Fellow Members,</hi> yea, the whole Body, or thoſe whom God has ſet in a more honourable and eminent Place in the Body than itſelf. Such ſuffer not the Word of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation; and term the Reproofs of Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (which is the Way of Life) <hi>Impoſition</hi> and <hi>Oppreſſion,</hi> and are not aware how far they are in the Things they condemn others for; while they ſpare not to reprove and revile all their Fellow Members: Yet if they be but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed

               <p>Therefore having, according to my Meaſure, received an Opening in my Underſtanding as to theſe Things, from the Light of the Lord, and having been for ſome Time under the weighty Senſe of them, I find at this Inſtant a Freedom to commit them to Writing, for the more uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Benefit and Edification of the Church of Chriſt.</p>

as Fools and Mad, to thoſe that judged ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Man. But their Words and Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony pierced through into the inner Man in the Heart, and reached to that of God in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; whereby as many as were ſimple-hearted, and waited for the Redemption of their Souls, received them as the Meſſengers of the moſt high God; and their Words were unto them, not as the Words of Men, but as the Words of God; for in the receiving and embracing the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Truth through them, they felt their Souls eaſed, and the acceptable Day began to dawn in and upon them.</p>
               <p>Now what Evidence brought theſe Men to make their Teſtimony to be received? Did they entice? Did they flatter? Did they daub up? Did they preach Liberty to the Fleſh or Will of Man? Nay verily, they uſed no ſuch Method: Their Words were as Thunder-Bolts, knocking down all that ſtood in their Way, and pouring down the Judgment of God upon the Head of the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor every where. Did they ſpare the zealous Profeſſor more than the open Profane? Nay veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they condemned equally the Hypocriſy of the one, as well as the Profanity of the other; yet wanted they not Regard to the tender Seed and Plant of God in either. Did they give way? Did they yield to the Wiſdom of Man? To the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſs of the Serpent, that would reaſon Truth for themſelves, ſaying, <hi>I muſt ſtay, until I be convinced of this, and that, and the other Thing; I ſee not yet this to be wrong, or the other Thing to be my Duty?</hi> How did they knock down this Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Reaſoning by the Spirit of God, which
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:007840_0015_102DB57551B17EC8"/>
wrought mightily in them, ſhewing and holding forth, that this is the Day of the Lord that is dawned; that all are invited to come; that none ought to tarry behind; that that which ſo pleadeth is the ſame Spirit which of old Time ſaid in thoſe that were invited, <hi>I cannot come yet, I muſt firſt marry a Wife; I muſt go prove my Yoke of Oxen; I muſt go viſit my Poſſeſſions; let me firſt bury my dead Father.</hi> Did not the Lord through them teſtify and declare againſt theſe Things? And is there not a Cloud of Witneſſes, who felt the Enemy thus reaſoning to keep us in the Forms, Fellowſhips; falſe Worſhips, and fooliſh Faſhions of this World? But we felt, as we were obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, all theſe Things to be for Condemnation; and that, as we obeyed the pure Manifeſtation of the Light of Jeſus in our Hearts, there was no He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation. We might and ſhould have parted with all thoſe Things at the Firſt; and what occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch Scruples, was but that which drew back, through being unwilling to give pure Obedience to the Croſs of Chriſt: For as many as gave Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and believed in the Light, found no Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of ſtumbling; but ſuch as believed not were condemned already, becauſe they believed not in him that appeared. Now the Boldneſs,<note place="margin">The Courage of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers.</note> and Courage, and Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of theſe Meſſengers Teſtimony, wrought ſuch Aſtoniſhment, Fear and Amazement in the Hearts of ſuch as were ingenuous, that many began to be inwardly pricked, as in the Days of old, and the Foundations of many began to be ſhaken; and ſome that were aſleep were awakened, and many that were dead and buried in the Graves of Sin,

and Formality, and Superſtition, and Idolatry of all Sorts, were alarmed; and many were brought in from the Hedges, and the High-Ways, and the Truth was received by Thouſands with great Cheerfulneſs, and a Readineſs of Mind: And the Feet of thoſe were beheld to be beautiful upon the Mountains, that brought the glad Tidings of theſe good Things. And great Lowlineſs and Simplicity of Heart was upon ſuch that were newly convinced of the Truth, and deep Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation of Spirit, and Subjection to the Power, both in themſelves, and in thoſe who were over them in the Lord, and had gathered them into the Truth.</p>
               <p>But as it was in the Gatherings of old, ſo it alſo ſell out in this Day; all kept not their firſt Love: As among thoſe Thouſands, which <hi>Moſes</hi> led out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and carried through the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> who had ſung Praiſes to God upon the Banks of Salvation, many Carcaſes fell in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; ſome who murmured and longed to return again to the Fleſh-Pots of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and ſome for oppoſing and contradicting the Servant,<note place="margin">Oppoſition and—</note> and Servants of the Lord, whom the Lord had made Uſe of to lead them out of Bondage, in ſaying, <hi>Ye take too much upon you; Hath the Lord indeed only ſpoken by</hi> Moſes? <hi>Hath he not ſpoken alſo by us?</hi> And as among theſe Multitudes, which were gathered by the Apoſtles, there were many who continued not faithful to the End; ſome returned back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with the Sow to the Puddle, after they were waſhed: ſome embraced the preſent World; ſome again ſeparated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,<note place="margin">—Separation entring.</note> being ſenſual, and without the Spirit, <hi>deſpiſing Dominion, and

ſpeaking Evil of Dignities;</hi> their Mouths ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great ſwelling Words, being puffed up, and not abiding in theſe Things, which they were taught of the Apoſtles: So it is to be lamented, that among theſe many Thouſands, whom the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts whom God raiſed up in <hi>This</hi> Day (for the gathering of his Seed and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple out of ſpiritual <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi> into his pure Light and Life) did bring forth and gather, there are that have fallen upon the Right-hand and the Left. Some are turned back again into <hi>Egypt,</hi> running into the ſame Exceſs of Luſt and Riot, from whence they were once purified and redeemed: Some could not bear the Reproach of the Croſs of Chriſt; and were by and anon offended in him: Some could not bear the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations, Sufferings and Perſecutions, which came for the Truth's Sake; and the Seed in them was ſoon ſcorched with the Heat of the Day. And ſome not abiding in Subjection to the Truth in themſelves, were not contented with that Place and Station in the Body, which God had placed them in; but became vainly puffed up in their fleſhly Minds, intruding into thoſe Things which they have not ſeen: And would needs be <hi>Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi> given to Change, and introducing new Doctrines and Practices, not only differing,<note place="margin">Innovators cauſing Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions.</note> but contrary to what was already delivered in the Beginning; making Parties, cauſing Diviſions and Rents, ſtumbling the Weak, and denying, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing and reviling the Apoſtles and Meſſengers of Chriſt, the Elders of the Church, who loved not their Lives unto Death, but through much

Care, and Travel, and Watchings and Whippings and Bonds, and Beatings, in daily Jeopardy, gathered us by the mighty Power of God into the moſt precious Truth. Yet in all this there hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing befallen us, but that which hath been the antient Lot of the Church of Chriſt in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Times.</p>
               <p>Now He, that was careful for his Church and People in old Times,<note place="margin">The good Shepherd of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s Care over his Church and People.</note> hath not been wanting to us in our Day; but as he has again reſtored the Truth unto its primitive Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity and Simplicity, and as he has delivered our Underſtandings from theſe falſe Doctrines and Principles, which prevailed in the Apoſtacy; ſo he hath not gathered us to be <hi>As Sheep ſcattered without a Shepherd,</hi> that every one may run his own Way, and every one follow his own Will, and ſo to be as a confuſed Maſs or Chaos, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Order; but He, even the <hi>LORD</hi> hath alſo gathered, and is gathering us into the <hi>good Order, Diſcipline, and Government of his own Son, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> Therefore he hath laid Care upon ſome beyond others, <hi>who watch for the Souls of their Brethren, as they that muſt give Account.</hi>

This I prefix to warn all to beware of ſtumbling at Things which are innocent in themſelves; and that we may labour to hold the ſteady even Path of Truth, without running into either of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams. For that Jeſus Chriſt did appoint Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Government to be in the Church, is very clear from his plain Words, <hi>Matt.</hi> 18.15, 16, 17, 18.

I am partly confident, that no rational Man will deny, but that theſe naturally follow from the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-mentioned Scripture; and if there ſhould be any found ſo unreaſonable as to deny it, I could prove it by neceſſary and unevitable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences; which at preſent, as taking it for granted, I forbear to do. If it be reckoned ſo great a Crime to <hi>offend one of the little Ones,</hi> that it were better for him, than ſo do, that a <hi>Mill-ſtone were hanged about his Neck, and he were drowned in the Depth of the Sea;</hi> without Queſtion, to offend and gainſay the whole Flock, muſt be

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The End of Church-Order.</note> Now if there were no Order nor Government in the Church, what ſhould become of thoſe that tranſgreſs? How ſhould they be again reſtored? Would not this make all Reproving, all Inſtructing, all Caring for, and Watching over one another, void and null? Why ſhould Chriſt have deſired them to proceed after this Method? Why doth he place ſo much Weight upon the Judgment of the Church, as to make the refuſing of hearing it, to draw ſo deep a Cenſure after it; which he will not have to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the refuſing to hear one or two a-part, though the Matter be one and the ſame? And ſo, as to the ſubſtantial and intrinſick Truth of the Thing, there lies the ſame Obligation upon the Tranſgreſſor to hear that one, as well as all; for that one adviſeth him to that which is right and good, as well as the whole; and they do but homologate or confirm that which that one hath already aſſerted: Yet Jeſus Chriſt, who is the Author of Order, and not of Confuſion, will not have a Brother cut off, or reputed a <hi>Publican,</hi> for refuſing to hear one or two, but for refuſing to hear the Church. And if it be objected, <hi>That the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>and all other falſe Churches, make uſe of this Scripture, and cover their Perſecution, and Cruelty, and Oppreſſion by it; and thou ſayeſt no more than they ſay.</hi> I Anſwer; I ſuppoſe no Man will be ſo unreaſonable as to affirm, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> abuſing this Scripture, will<note place="margin">Objection.</note>

I am not now claiming Right to this Power, as due to us (that is reſerved for another Place;) but this, I ſay, is that which I now aver to be manifeſt from the Scripture-Teſtimony, and to be in itſelf an unqueſtionable Truth, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt intended there ſhould be Order and Government in his Church;</hi> which is the Thing at preſent in Hand to be proved; Which if it be ſo really true (as it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied) then I hope it will alſo neceſſarily follow, that ſuch, who really and truly are the Church of Chriſt, have Right to exerciſe this Order and Government.</p>

I anſwer, The Spirit of God leads us ſo to do; what can they ſay to the contrary? Nor is this a Practice any ways inconſiſtent with being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly and immediately led by the Spirit; for the Spirit of God doth now, as well as in the Days of old, lead his People into thoſe Things which are orderly, and of a good Report; for he is the God of Order, and not of Confuſion: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the holy Apoſtles judged it no Inconſiſtency with their being led by the Spirit, to appoint <hi>Men full of the Holy Ghoſt, and of Wiſdom, over the Buſineſs of the Poor.</hi> Now, if to be <hi>full of the Holy Ghoſt</hi> be a Qualification needful for this Employment; ſurely the Nature of their Employment was not to render this ſo needful a Qualification uſeleſs and ineffectual, as if they were not to be led by it.<note place="margin">The Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Apoſtles.</note>

Which is no other, but the giving of a general Intimation what the Needs are, that every one, as God moves their Hearts, and hath proſpered them (without Impoſition, Force or Limitation) may give towards theſe needful Uſes. In which Caſe theſe Murmurers at our good Order in ſuch Matters, may well think ſtrange at the Apoſtle: How preſſingly! how earneſtly doth he reiterate his Deſires and Provocations, ſo to ſpeak, in this Reſpect to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.2. and the eighth and ninth Chapters of the ſecond Epiſtle throughout!</p>

<pb n="47" facs="unknown:007840_0054_102DB5E9C7D22AB0"/>
yet he ſuppoſeth it ſafer to ſubmit to their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in ſuch Caſes, though it were by <hi>taking Wrong,</hi> or <hi>ſuffering Wrong,</hi> than to go before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to the greater Reproach of the Truth. We hope, though many Occaſions of this kind have fallen in among us, ſince we have been a People, none have had juſt Occaſion to decline our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And though ſome ſhould ſuppoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be wronged; yet if they ſhould bring their Matter before others, we might ſay, as the Apoſtle ſaith in the fore-mentioned Chapter, Ver. 7. <hi>This were thereby a Fault in them,</hi> and would evidence a greater Care of ſome outward Concern, than of the Honour and Intereſt of Truth; and therefore ſuch as have a tender Regard that way, would rather ſuffer what, to their Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, may ſeem wrong.

I ſay, ſuch as ſo do, firſt commit a certain Hurt, and Evil, in ſtaining the Honour and Reputation, of the Truth they profeſs, which ought to be dearer to us than our Lives. And even in that outward Matter, for which they thus do, they run a Hazard, not knowing whether Things ſhall carry, as they expect: If they loſe, they have a double Prejudice; if they gain, it is a too dear Rate, even with the Hurt of <hi>Truth's</hi> Reputation, which their outward Advantage can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make up.

We deſire not to propagate Hurt, and defile Peoples Minds, with telling them ſuch Things as tend not to edify; yet do we not ſo cover over, or ſmooth over any Wickedneſs, as not to deal roundly with the Perſons guilty, and cauſing them to take away the Scandal in their Acknowledgment before all, to whole Knowledge in hath come: Yet judge we not ourſelves obliged to <hi>tell that in</hi> Gath, <hi>or publiſh that in the Streets of</hi> Aſkelon, <hi>which make the Daughters of the Uncircumciſed rejoice;</hi> or ſtrengthen <hi>Atheiſts</hi> and <hi>Ranters</hi> in their Obdurateneſs, who feed more upon the Failings of the Saints, than to imitate their true Repentance.

For which,

beſides the poſitive Promiſe of Chriſt before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned (which is not without Blaſphemy to be called in Queſtion, or doubted of) I ſhall add theſe Reaſons. That ſeeing the Church of Chriſt is his Body, of which he is the Head, it were to make Chriſt negligent of his Body, who ſtiles himſelf the good Shepherd, and hath ſaid, <hi>He will never leave nor forſake his own;</hi> or elſe (which is worſe) it will infer a Poſſibility of <hi>Error,</hi> or <hi>Miſtake</hi> in Chriſt, in whom, as the Head, are the Eyes of the Body, by which it is to be ruled in all Things. <hi>Next,</hi> We never find in alt the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſince the Goſpel, that ever this was wanting; but that God ſtill gave infallible Judgment by his Spirit in ſome of the Reſpects above-mentioned. If the Tranſactions and Controverſies of the after Centuries be alledged, I will boldly affirm and prove, That there was never a true Judgment wanting, ſo long as the Nature and <hi>Eſſence</hi> of the true Church was retained: If any will needs affirm otherwiſe, let them ſhew me where, and I ſhall anſwer it. Though I deny not (that after the Myſtery of <hi>Iniquity</hi> did begin to work, or had ſo wrought, firſt by intermixing, and afterward by altogether forſaking the Nature of Truth, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining only the bare Name of the Church) but that there might be ſome ſcattered Ones, here and there one in a Nation, and now and then one in an Age, who, by the Power and Virtue of the Spirit of Life working in them, might be truly ſanctified; yet theſe were but as Witneſſes in Sackcloth, no ways ſufficient to give theſe Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, in which they were engroſſed, the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation <note place="margin">Witneſſes in Sackcloth.</note>

of the Church of Chriſt, coming no more under Obſervation by the Generality, nor having, as to them, any more Influence than ſome little or ſcarcely diſcernable Sparks of Fire in many great Heaps and Mountains of Aſhes. And thus much to prove, that where there is any Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering or Aſſembly, which truly and properly may be called the Church of Chriſt, the <hi>infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Judgment</hi> will never be wanting in Matters of Controverſy.</p>
               <p>

Since there are Strong and Weak, Babes and young Men, <hi>who have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the evil One, and in whom the Word of God abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi> ſuch are more able, when the Enemy beſets, to reſiſt (having already overcome) than others who are but yet wreſtling, and not Conquerors. Now, every Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy and Diſſention in the Church Comes from the Beſetments of the Enemy; yet if any of theſe ſtrong <note place="margin">From the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetments of the Enemy Diſſentions ariſe.</note>

or young Men, or powerful Members, go from their Station, it is not denied but that they are as weak as any; and it is pre-ſuppoſing their Faithfulneſs in their I lace that I thus affirm, and no otherwiſe. Nor vet do I limit the Lord to this Method: <hi>For in him are all the Treaſures both of our Wiſdom and Strength;</hi> and the weakeſt in his Hand are as ſtrong as the ſtrongeſt, who may now, as well as heretofore, kill a <hi>Goliah</hi> by the Hand of little <hi>David;</hi> yet we ſee the Lord doth ordinarily make uſe of the Strong to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Weak: And indeed, when ſuch as may be termed weak are ſo made uſe of, it alters the Nature of their Place, and conſtitutes them in a higher and more eminent Degree. For though it was little <hi>David,</hi> it was alſo he that was to be King of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Though the Apoſtles were mean Men among the <hi>Jews,</hi> yet they were ſuch as were to be the Apoſtles of the Lord of Glory; Inſtruments to gather the loſt Sheep of the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and to proclaim the acceptable Day of the Lord. And though <hi>Paul</hi> was once accounted the <hi>leaſt of all the Saints, a Child born out of due Time;</hi> yet was he him who was to be the greateſt Apoſtle of the <hi>Gentilès.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now then, let us conſider whom the Lord makes uſe of in the Affairs of the primitive Church, and through whom he gave forth his infallible Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Did he not begin firſt by <hi>Peter?</hi> He was the firſt that ſpake in the firſt Meeting they had, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. and who firſt ſtood up after the pouring forth of the Spirit; and who firſt appeared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Council of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and ſpake in Behalf of the Goſpel of Chriſt: Though I am far from
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:007840_0100_102DB65AACDD2738"/>
calling him (as ſome do) the Prince of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; yet I may ſafely ſay, he was one of the moſt <hi>antient</hi> and <hi>eminent,</hi> and to whom Chriſt, in a Manner ſomewhat more than ordinary, had recommended the Feeding of his Flock. We ſee alſo he was firſt made uſe of in preaching to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and what Weight his and <hi>James's</hi> Words had in the Conteſt about Circumciſion towards the bringing the Matter to a Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. Yet that we may ſee Infallibility was not inſeparably annexed to him, he was found blameable in a certain Matter, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.11. not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his Sentence was poſitively received in many Particulars.</p>
               <p>So alſo the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> argues from his ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of the Churches of <hi>Corinth</hi> and <hi>Galatia,</hi> that they ought to be Followers of him, and poſitively concludes in divers Things. And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Suppoſition, exhorts the Churches (both he and <hi>Peter</hi>) in many Paſſages heretofore men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned (which I will not, to avoid Repetition, again rehearſe) <hi>to obey the Elders that watch for them; to hold ſuch in Reputation, and to ſubmit themſelves to them that have addicted themſelves to the Miniſtry of the Saints,</hi> Cor. 16.15, 16.</p>
               <p>Alſo, we ſee how the Lord makes uſe of <hi>John,</hi> his beloved Diſciple, to inform and reprove the <hi>Seven Churches of Aſia;</hi> and no Doubt <hi>John</hi> (the reſt, by the uſual Computation, being at that time all removed) was then the moſt noted and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Elder alive: And, indeed, I mind not where, under the Goſpel, Chriſt hath uſed any other Method; but that he always, in revealing his Will, hath made uſe of ſuch as he himſelf had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:007840_0101_102DB65CF23DF040"/>

And God doth ſo furniſh thoſe whom he raiſes up, in a ſingular Manner, of which (as I ſaid) I mind no Inſtance in the <hi>New-Teſtament:</hi> And in the <hi>Old</hi> we ſee, though it was ſtrange that little <hi>David</hi> ſhould oppoſe himſelf to the great <hi>Goliah,</hi> yet he had, before that, killed both the Lion and the Bear, which was no leſs improbable; and which of all is moſt obſervable, was, before that Time, by the Appointment of God, and the Hand of the Prophet, anointed King of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the 16th and 17th Chapters of the Firſt of <hi>Samuel.</hi>

exerciſe that Place in the Body, which the Head moves them to, is not to uſurp Authority over their Fellow Members. As, on the other Hand, to ſubmit and obey (it being the Place of ſome ſo to do) is not a renouncing a being led by the Spirit, ſeeing the Spirit leads them ſo to do: And not to obey, in caſe the Judgment be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Truth, and the Spirit lead to it, is, no Doubt, both offenſive and ſinful.

                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Object of this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is two-fold, <hi>outwards</hi> and <hi>inwards.</hi> The <hi>Outwards</hi> relate mainly to the Care of the Poor, of Widows and Fatherleſs;

where may be alſo included Marriages, and the Removing of all Scandals in Things undeniably wrong. The <hi>Inwards</hi> reſpect an Apoſtacy, either in Principles or Practices that have a Pretence of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and that either in denying ſome Truths already received and believed, or aſſerting new Doctrines that ought not to be received. Which again (to ſub-divide) may either be in Things fundamental, and of great Moment; or in Things of leſs Weight in themſelves, yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from a wrong Spirit, and which in the natural and certain Conſequence of them, tend to make Schiſms, Diviſions, Animoſities, and in Sum, to break that Bond of Love and Unity that is ſo needful to be upheld and eſtabliſhed in the Church of Chriſt. Am here come alſo under this Conſideration all Emulations, Strifes, Backbit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and evil Surmiſings.</p>
