            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Author knows not whether it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to apologize for the extraordinary length of this Sermon, which ſo much exceeds the usual limits of public discourses; for it is only for the Reader to conceive, (by a fiction of the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if he pleases so to consider it,) that the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of the Audience indulged him with their attention during its delivery. The fact is, not being in the habit of writing his sermons, this discourse was not committed to paper till after it was delivered; so that the phraseology may probably vary, and the bulk be somewhat ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; but the substance is certainly retained.</p>
            <p>He muſt crave the indulgence of the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Public for having blended so little <hi>theology</hi> with it. He is fully aware, the chief attention of a Christian Minister should be occupied in explaining the doctrines, and enforcing the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, of genuine Christianity; nor is he charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, he hopes, in the exercise of his public func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, with any remarkable deviation from that rule of conduct; yet is he equally convinced, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursions into other topics are sometimes both lawful and necessary. The versality of error de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands a correspondent variety in the methods
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:037564_0003_100EDC83472CB350"/>of defending truth: and from whom have the public more right to expect its defence, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to the encroachment of error and Infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than from thoſe who profess to devote their studies and their lives to the advancement of virtue and Religion? Accordingly, a multitude of publications on these subjects equally power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in argument, and impressive in manner, have issued from Divines of different persuasions, which must be allowed to have done the utmoſt honor to the clerical profession. The most lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous statements of the evidences of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, on historical grounds, have been made; the petulant cavils of Infidels satisfactorily refut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and their ignorance, if not put to shame, at least amply exposed; so that Revelation, as far as truth and reason can prevail, is on all sides triumphant.</p>
            <p>There is one point of view, however, in which the respective systems remain to be examined, which, though hitherto little considered, is forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon our attention by the present conduct of our adversaries; that is, their <hi>Influence on So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</hi> The controversy appears to have taken a new turn. The advocates of Infidelity, baffled in the field of argument, though unwilling to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquish the contest, have changed their mode of attack, and seem less disposed to impugn the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority than to supersede the use of Revealed Religion, by giving such representations of man and of society as are calculated to make its sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions appear unreasonable and unnecessary. Their aim is not so much to discredit the pretensions
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:037564_0004_100EDC8552B4E508"/>of any particular Religion, as to set aside the principles common to all.</p>
            <p>To obliterate the sense of Deity, of moral sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and a future world, and by these means to prepare the way for the total subverſion of every institution, both social and religious, which men have been hitherto accustomed to revere, is evidently the principal object of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Sceptics; the firſt Sophiſts who have avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an attempt to govern the world without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcating the persuasion of a superior power. It might well excite our surprise, to behold an effort to shake off the yoke of Religion, which was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally unknown during the prevalence of gross superstition, reserved for a period of the world distinguished from every other by the possession of a Revelation more pure, perfect and better authenticated, than the enlightened sages of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity ever ventured to anticipate, were we not fully persuaded the immaculate holineſs of this Revelation is precisely that which renders it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gusting to men who are determined at all events to retain their vices. Our Saviour furnishes the Solution; <hi>they love darkness rather than light, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their deeds are evil; neither will they come to the light lest their deeds should be reproved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While all the Religions, the Jewish excepted, which, previous to the promulgation of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, prevailed in the world, partly the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of human policy, partly the offspring of ignorant fear, mixed with the mutilated re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of traditionary revelation, were favorable to the indulgence of some vices, and but feebly
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:037564_0005_100EDC86F674A4B0"/>restrained the practice of others; betwixt vice of every sort and in every degree, and the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of Jesus, there subsists an irreconcileable enmity, an eternal discord. The dominion of Chriſtianity being, in the very essence of it, the dominion of virtue, we need look no farther for the sources of hostility in any who oppose it, than their attachment to vice and disorder.</p>
            <p>This view of the controversy, if it be just, demonſtrates its supreme importance, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes the strongest plea with every one with whom it is not a matter of indifference whether vice or virtue, delusion or truth, govern the world, to exert his talents in whatever propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they are possessed, in <hi>contending earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints.</hi> In such a crisis, is it not best for Christians of all denominations, that they may better concentrate their forces againſt the common adversary, to suspend for the present their internal disputes, imitating the policy of wise states, who have never failed to consider the invasion of an enemy as the signal for terminating the contests of party? Internal peace is the best fruit we can reap from external danger. The momentous contest at issue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Christian Church and Infidels, may instruct us how trivial, for the most part, are the controverſies of its members with each other, and that the different ceremonies, opinions and practices, by which they are distinguished, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respond to the variety of feature and complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, discernible in the offspring of the same Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, among whom there subsists the greatest fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:037564_0006_100EDC88F0CD6880"/>likeneſs. May it please God so to dispose the minds of Christians of every visible church and community, <hi>that Ephraim no longer vexing Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, nor Judah Ephraim,</hi> the only rivalry felt in future may be, who shall most advance the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests of our common Christianity, and the only provocation sustained, <hi>that of provoking each other to love and good works!</hi> When, at the distance of more than half a century, Christianity was as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted, by a <hi>Woolston,</hi> a <hi>Tindal</hi> and a <hi>Morgan,</hi> it was ably supported both by Clergymen of the Established Church, and writers among Protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Dissenters; the labours of a <hi>Clarke</hi> and a <hi>Butler,</hi> were associated with those of a <hi>Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dridge,</hi> a <hi>Leland</hi> and a <hi>Lardner,</hi> with such equal reputation and success, as to make it evident that the intrinsic excellence of Religion needs not the aid of external appendages; but that, with or without a dowry, her charms are of sufficient power to fix and engage the heart.</p>
            <p>The writer of this discourse will feel himself happy, should his example stimulate any of his brethren, of ſuperior abilities, to contribute their exertions in so good a cause. His apology for not entering more at large, into the proofs of the being of a God,<note n="*" place="bottom">See an excellent Sermon on Atheism, by the Rev. Mr. <hi>Estlin, of Bristol,</hi> at whose meeting the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of this discourse was first preached. In the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon referred to, the argument for the existence of a Deity, is stated with the utmost clearness and precision, and the sophistry of <hi>Dupuis,</hi> a French Infidel, refuted in a very satisfactory manner.</note> and the evidences of Christian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity<note n="†" place="bottom">It is almost superfluous to name a work so univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally known as Dr. <hi>Paley's View of the Evidences of Christianity,</hi> which is, probably, without exception, the most clear and satisfactory statement of the Historical proofs of the Christian Religion, ever exhibited in any age or country.</note>,
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:037564_0007_100EDC8ABA4655C0"/>is, that these subjects have been already han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled with great ability by various writers, and that he wished rather to confine himself to one view of the subject, the total incompatibility of Sceptical principles with the existence of Society. Should his life be spared, he may probably, at ſome future time, enter into a fuller and more particular examination of the Infidel Philoſophy, both with respect to its speculative principles, and its practical effects; its influence on Society and on the individual. In the mean time, he humbly consecrates this discourse to the honour of that Saviour, who, when the means of a more liberal offering are wanting, commends the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow's mite.</p>

            <head>A SERMON ON EPHESIANS ii. 12.</head>
            <head type="sub">Without God in the world.</head>
            <p>AS the Chriſtian miniſtry is eſtabliſhed for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of men, throughout every age, in truth and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieneſs, it muſt adapt itſelf to the ever ſhifting ſcenes of the moral world, and ſtand ready to repel the attacks of impiety and error, under whatever form they may appear. The church and the world form two ſocieties ſo diſtinct, and governed by ſuch oppoſite principles and maxims, that, as well from this contrariety as from the expreſs warnings of ſcripture, true Chriſtians muſt look for a ſtate of warfare, with this conſoling aſſurance, that the Church, like the burning buſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held by Moſes in the land of Midian, may be encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed with flames, but will never be conſumed.</p>
            <p>When ſhe was delivered from the perſecuting power of Rome, ſhe only experienced a change of trials. The oppreſſion of external violence was followed by the more dangerous and inſidious attacks of internal enemies. The freedom of enquiry claimed and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted at the reformation, degenerated, in the hands of men who profeſſed the principles without poſſeſſing the ſpirit of the reformers, into a fondneſs for ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative refinements, and conſequently into a ſource of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037564_0010_100EDC90F3B0A2B0"/>diſpute, faction and hereſy. While proteſtants attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more to the points on which they differed, than to thoſe in which they agreed, while more zeal was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in ſettling ceremonies and defending ſubtleties, than in enforcing plain and revealed truths, the lovely fruits of peace and charity periſhed under the ſtorms of controverſy</p>
            <p>In this disjointed, and diſordered ſtate of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian church, they who never looked into the interior of Chriſtianity were apt to ſuſpect, that to a ſubject ſo fruitful in particular diſputes, muſt attach a general un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty, and that a religion founded on revelation, could never have occaſioned ſuch diſcordancy of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and practice amongſt its diſciples. Thus infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity is the joint offspring of an irreligious temper and unholy ſpeculation, employed, not in examining the evidences of Chriſtianity, but in detecting the vices and imperfections of profeſſing Chriſtians. It has paſſed through various ſtages, each diſtinguiſhed by higher gradations of impiety; for, when men arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly abandon their guide, and wilfully ſhut their eyes on the light of Heaven, it is wiſely ordained that their errors ſhall multiply at every ſtep, until their extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance confutes itſelf, and the miſchief of their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples works its own antidote. That ſuch has been the progreſs of infidelity will be obvious from a ſlight ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey of its hiſtory:</p>
            <p>Lord <hi>Herbert,</hi> the firſt and pureſt of our Engliſh free-thinkers, who flouriſhed in the beginning of the reign of Charles the firſt, did not ſo much impugn the doctrine or the morality of the ſcriptures, as attempt to ſuperſede their neceſſity, by endeavouring to ſhew, that the great principles of the unity of God, a moral government, and a future world, are taught with ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient clearneſs by the light of nature. <hi>Bolingbroke</hi> and others of his ſucceſſors, advanced much farther, and attempted to invalidate the proofs of the moral character of the Deity, and conſequently all expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037564_0011_100EDC92D0B17BB8"/>of rewards and puniſhments, leaving the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Being no other perfections than thoſe which belong to a firſt cauſe or Almighty contriver. After him, at a conſiderable diſtance, followed <hi>Hume,</hi> the moſt ſubtle, if not the moſt philoſophical of the deiſts, who, by perplexing the relations of cauſe and effect, boldly aimed to introduce an univerſal ſcepticiſm, and to pour a more than Egyptian darkneſs into the whole region of morals. Since his time, ſceptical writers have ſprung up in abundance, and infidelity has allured multitudes to its ſtandard; the young and ſuperficial by its dexterous ſophiſtry, the vain by the literary fame of its champions, and the profligate by the licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of its principles. Atheiſm, the moſt undiſguiſed, has, at length, begun to make its appearance.</p>
            <p>Animated by numbers and emboldened by ſucceſs, the infidels of the preſent day have given a new direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their efforts, and impreſſed a new character on the ever growing maſs of their impious ſpeculations.</p>
            <p>By uniting more cloſely with each other, by giving a ſprinkling of religion to all their literary productions they aim to engroſs the formation of the public mind, and, amidſt the warmeſt profeſſions of attachment to virtue, to effect an entire diſruption of morality from religion. Pretending to be the teachers of virtue and the guides of life, they propoſe to revolutionize the morals of mankind, to regenerate the world by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs entirely new, and to rear the temple of virtue, not merely without the aid of religion, but on the renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of its principles and the deriſion of its ſanctions. Their party has derived a great acceſſion of numbers and ſtrength, from events the moſt momentous and aſtoniſhing in the political world, which have divided the ſentiments of Europe betwixt hope and terror, and, however they may iſſue, have, for the preſent, ſwelled the ranks of infidelity. So rapidly, indeed, has it advanced ſince this criſis, that a great majority on the continent, and in England a conſiderable propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037564_0012_100EDC94C0250490"/>of thoſe who purſue literature as a profeſſion,<note n="*" place="bottom">By thoſe who purſue literature as a profeſſion, the Author would be underſtood to mean that numerous claſs of literary men who draw their principal ſubſiſtence from their writings.</note> may juſtly be conſidered as the open or diſguiſed abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of Atheiſm.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the ſceptical and religious ſyſtems, the inquiry at preſent is not ſo much which is the trueſt in ſpeculation, as which is the moſt uſeful in practice; or, in other words, whether morality will be beſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted, by conſidering it as part of a great and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive law, emanating from the will of a ſupreme, om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent legiſlator; or as a mere expedient adapted to our preſent ſituation, enforced by no other motives than thoſe which ariſe from the proſpects and intereſts of the preſent ſtate. The <hi>absurdity</hi> of Atheiſm having been demonſtrated ſo often and ſo clearly by many eminent men, that this part of the ſubject is exhauſted, I ſhould haſten immediately to what I have more particularly in view, were I not apprehenſive a diſcourſe of this kind may be expected to contain ſome ſtatement of the argument in proof of a Deity, which, therefore, I ſhall preſent in as few and plain words as poſſible.</p>
            <p>When we examine a watch, or any other piece of machinery, we inſtantly perceive marks of deſign. The arrangement of its ſeveral parts and the adaption of its movements to one reſult, ſhew it to be a contrivance; nor do we ever imagine the faculty of contriving to be in the watch itſelf, but in a ſeparate agent. If we turn from art to nature, we behold a vaſt magazine of contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, we ſee innumerable objects replete with the moſt exquiſite deſign. The human eye, for example, is formed, with admirable ſkill for the purpoſe of ſight; the ear for the function of hearing. As in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of art, we never think of aſcribing the power of contrivance to the machine itſelf, ſo we are certain
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037564_0013_100EDC969FF66368"/>the ſkill diſplayed in the human ſtructure is not a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of man, ſince he is very imperfectly acquainted with his own formation. If there be an inſeparable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation betwixt the ideas of a contrivance and a contriver, and it be evident in regard to the human ſtructure the deſigning agent is not man himſelf, there muſt undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be ſome ſeparate inviſible Being who is his former. This great Being we mean to indicate by the appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Deity.</p>
            <p>This reaſoning admits of but one reply. Why, it will be ſaid, may we not ſuppoſe the world has always continued as it is; that is, that there has been a conſtant ſucceſſion of finite beings, appearing and diſappearing on the earth from all eternity? I anſwer, whatever is ſuppoſed to have occaſioned this conſtant ſucceſſion, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive of an intelligent cauſe, will never account for the undeniable marks of deſign, viſible in all finite Beings; nor is the abſurdity of ſuppoſing a contrivance without a contriver diminiſhed by this imaginary ſucceſſion, but rather increaſed by being repeated at every ſtep of the ſeries.</p>
            <p>Beſides, an eternal ſucceſſion of finite beings involves in it a contradiction, and is, therefore, plainly impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. As the ſuppoſition is made to get quit of the idea of any one having exiſted from eternity, each of the beings in the ſucceſſion muſt have begun in time; but the ſucceſſion itſelf is eternal. We have then a ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of beings infinitely earlier than any being in the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion; or, in other words, a ſeries of beings running on <hi>ad infinitum,</hi> before it reached any particular being; which is abſurd.</p>
            <p>From theſe conſiderations, it is manifeſt there muſt be ſome eternal Being, or nothing could ever have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſted; and ſince the beings which we behold, bear in their whole ſtructure evident marks of wiſdom and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, it is equally certain that he who formed them is a wiſe and intelligent agent.</p>
            <p>To prove the unity of this great Being, in oppoſition
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:037564_0014_100EDC9875BABED8"/>to a plurality of Gods, it is not neceſſary to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to metaphyſical abſtractions: it is ſufficient to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the notion of more than one author of nature is inconſiſtent with that harmony of deſign which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vades her works, that it ſolves no appearances, is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by no evidence, and ſerves no purpoſe but to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſs and perplex our conceptions.</p>
            <p>Such are the proofs of the exiſtence of that great and glorious Being whom we denominate God; and it is not preſumption to ſay, it is impoſſible to find another truth in the whole compaſs of morals, which, according to the juſteſt laws of reaſoning, admits of ſuch ſtrict and rigorous demonſtration.</p>
            <p>But I proceed to the more immediate object of this diſcourſe, which, as has been already intimated, is not ſo much to evince the falſehood of Scepticiſm as a theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as to diſplay its miſchievous effects, contraſted with thoſe which reſult from the belief of a Deity, and a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtate. The ſubject viewed in this light, may be conſidered under two aſpects; the influence of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite ſyſtems on the principles of morals, and on the formation of character; the firſt may be ſtiled their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, the latter their equally important, but indirect, conſequence and tendency.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The ſceptical or irreligious ſyſtem ſubverts the whole foundation of morals. It may be aſſumed as a maxim, that no perſon can be required to act contrary to his greateſt good, or his higheſt intereſt, comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively viewed in relation to the whole duration of his being. It is often our duty to forego our own intereſt <hi>partially;</hi> to ſacrifice a ſmaller pleaſure for the ſake of a greater; to incur a preſent evil in purſuit of a diſtant good of more conſequence: in a word, to arbitrate, amongſt interfering claims of inclination, is the moral arithmetic of human life. But to riſque the happineſs of the whole duration of our being in any caſe whatever, admitting it to be poſſible, would be fooliſh, becauſe the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:037564_0015_100EDC9ACB925F30"/>ſacrifice muſt, by the nature of it, be ſo great as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the poſſibility of compenſation.</p>
            <p>As the preſent world, upon ſceptical principles, is the only place of recompence, whenever the practice of virtue fails to promiſe the greateſt ſum of preſent good, caſes which often occur in reality, and much oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ener in appearance, every motive to virtuous conduct is ſuperſeded, a deviation from rectitude becomes the part of wiſdom; and ſhould the path of virtue, in addition to this, be obſtructed by diſgrace, torment, or death, to perſevere would be madneſs and folly, and a violation of the firſt and moſt eſſential law of nature. Virtue on theſe principles, being in numberleſs inſtances, at war with ſelf-preſervation, never can or ought to become a fixed habit of the mind.</p>
            <p>The ſyſtem of Infidelity is not only incapable of arming virtue for great and trying occaſions; but leaves it unſupported in the moſt ordinary occurrences. In vain will its advocates appeal to a moral ſenſe, to bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence and ſympathy; in vain will they expatiate on the tranquillity and pleaſure attendant on a virtuous courſe; for it is undeniable that theſe impulſes may be overcome, and though you may remind the offender, that in diſregarding them he has violated his nature, and that a conduct conſiſtent with them is productive of much internal ſatisfaction; yet, if he reply that his taſte is of a different ſort, that there are other gratifications which he values more, and that every man muſt chooſe his own pleaſures, the argument is at an end.</p>
            <p>Rewards and puniſhments awarded by omnipotent power, afford a palpable and preſſing motive, which can never be neglected without renouncing the character of a rational creature; but taſtes and reliſhes are not to be preſcribed.</p>
            <p>A motive in which the reaſon of man ſhall acquieſce, enforcing the practice of virtue, at all times and ſeaſons, enters into the very eſſence of moral obligation; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern infidelity ſupplies no ſuch motive; it is, therefore,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:037564_0016_100EDC9C7A4CD5D0"/>eſſentially and infallibly a ſyſtem of enervation, turpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and vice.</p>
            <p>This chaſm in the conſtruction of morals, can only be ſupplied by the firm belief of a rewarding and avenging Deity, who binds duty and happineſs, though they may ſeem diſtant, in an indiſſoluble chain, without which whatever uſurps the name of virtue, is not a principle, but a feeling, not a determinate rule, but a fluctuating expedient, varying with the taſtes of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals, and changing with the ſcenes of life.</p>
            <p>Nor is this the only way in which Infidelity ſubverts the foundation of morals. All reaſoning on the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, pre-ſuppoſes a diſtinction betwixt inclinations and duties, affections and rules: the former prompt, the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter preſcribe; the former ſupply motives to action, the latter regulate and control it. Hence, it is evident, if virtue has any juſt claim to authority, it muſt be under the latter of theſe notions, that is, under the character of a law. It is under this notion, <hi>in fact,</hi> that its domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion has ever been acknowledged to be paramount and ſupreme.</p>
            <p>But without the intervention of a ſuperior will, it is impoſſible there ſhould be any moral laws, except in the lax, metaphorical ſenſe, in which we ſpeak of the laws of matter and motion: men being eſſentially equal, morality is, on theſe principles, only a ſtipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or ſilent compact, into which every individual is ſuppoſed to enter, as far as ſuits his convenience, and for the breach of which he is accountable to nothing but his own mind. His own mind is his law, his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal, and his judge.</p>
            <p>Two conſequences, the moſt diſaſtrous to ſociety, will inevitably follow the general prevalence of this ſyſtem; the frequent perpetration of great crimes, and the total abſence of great virtues.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In thoſe conjunctures which tempt avarice or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame ambition, when a crime flatters with the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of impunity and the certainty of immenſe advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:037564_0017_100EDC9E3585B0D0"/>what is to reſtrain an Atheiſt from its commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion? To ſay that remorſe will deter him, is abſurd; for remorſe, as diſtinguiſhed from pity, is the ſole off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of religious belief, the extinction of which is the great purpoſe of the infidel philoſophy.</p>
            <p>The dread of puniſhment or infamy from his fellow creatures, will be an equally ineffectual barrier, becauſe crimes are only committed under ſuch circumſtances as ſuggeſt the hope of concealment; not to ſay that crimes themſelves will ſoon loſe their infamy and their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, under the influence of that ſyſtem which deſtroys the ſanctity of virtue, by converting it into a low calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of worldly intereſt. Here the ſenſe of an ever-preſent Ruler and of an avenging Judge, is of the moſt awful and indiſpenſible neceſſity, as it is that alone which impreſſes on all crimes the character of folly, ſhews that duty and intereſt in every inſtance coincide, and that the moſt proſperous career of vice, the moſt brilliant ſucceſſes of criminality, are but an <hi>accumula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of wrath against the day of wrath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the frequent perpetration of great crimes is an inevitable conſequence of the diffuſion of ſceptical principles, ſo to underſtand this conſequence in its full extent, we muſt look beyond their immediate effects, and confider the diſruption of ſocial ties, the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of confidence, the terror, ſuſpicion and hatred, which muſt prevail in that ſtate of ſociety in which barbarous deeds are familiar. The tranquillity which pervades a well-ordered community, and the mutual good offices which bind its members together, is founded on an implied confidence in the indiſpoſition to annoy, in the juſtice, humanity and moderation of thoſe among whom we dwell; ſo that the worſt conſequence of crimes is, that they impair the ſtock of public charity and general tenderneſs. The dread and hatred of our ſpecies would infallibly be grafted on a conviction that we were expoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, every moment, to the ſurges of an unbridled fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocity, and that nothing but the power of the magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:037564_0018_100EDCA004DAF350"/>ſtood between us and the daggers of aſſaſſins. In ſuch a ſtate, laws deriving no ſupport from public man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, are unequal to the taſk of curbing the fury of the paſſions, which from being concentrated into ſelfiſhneſs, fear and revenge, acquire new force; terror and ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion beget cruelty, and inflict injuries by way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention; pity is extinguiſhed in the ſtronger impulſe of ſelf-preſervation; the tender and generous affections are cruſhed, and nothing is ſeen but the retaliation of wrongs, the fierce and unmitigated ſtruggle for ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority. This is but a faint ſketch of the incalculable calamities and horrors we muſt expect, ſhould we be ſo unfortunate as ever to witneſs the triumph of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern infidelity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This ſyſtem is a ſoil as barren of great and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime virtues, as it is prolific in crimes. By great and ſublime virtues are meant, thoſe which are called into action on great and trying occaſions, which demand the ſacrifice of the deareſt intereſts and proſpects of human life, and ſometimes of life itſelf; the virtues, in a word, which by their rarity and ſplendour draw admiration, and have rendered illuſtrious the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of patriots, martyrs, and confeſſors. It requires but little reflection to perceive, that whatever veils a future world, and contracts the limits of exiſtence within the preſent life, muſt tend, in a proportionable degree, to diminiſh the grandeur and narrow the ſphere of human agency.</p>
            <p>As well might you expect exalted ſentiments of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice from a profeſſed gameſter, as look for noble princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in the man whoſe hopes and fears are all ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on the preſent moment, and who ſtakes the whole happineſs of his being on the events of this vain and fleeting life. If he is ever impelled to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> of great atchievements in a good cauſe, it muſt be ſolely by the hope of fame; a motive which, beſides that it makes virtue the ſervant of opinion, uſually grows weaker at the approach of death, and
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:037564_0019_100EDCA27AE4D7E0"/>which, however it may ſurmount the love of exiſtence, in the heat of battle, or in the moment of public ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, can ſeldom be expected to operate with much force on the retired duties of a private ſtation.</p>
            <p>In affirming that infidelity is unfavourable to the higher claſs of virtues, we are ſupported as well by facts as by reaſoning. We ſhould be ſorry to load our adverſaries with unmerited reproach; but to what hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, to what record, will they appeal, for the traits of moral greatneſs, exhibited by their diſciples? Where ſhall we look for the trophies of infidel magnanimity, or atheiſtical virtue? Not that we mean to accuſe them of inactivity: they have recently filled the world with the ſame of their exploits; exploits of a different kind indeed, but of imperiſhable memory and diſaſtrous luſtre.</p>
            <p>Though it is confeſſed, great and ſplendid actions are not the ordinary employment of life, but muſt from their nature, be reſerved for high and eminent occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, yet, that ſyſtem is eſſentially defective which leaves no room for their cultivation. They are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, both from their immediate advantage and their remoter influence. They often ſave, and always illuſtrate, the age and nation in which they appear. They raiſe the ſtandard of morals; they arreſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of degeneracy; they diffuſe a luſtre over the path of life: monuments of the greatneſs of the human ſoul, they preſent to the world the auguſt image of virtue in her ſublimeſt form, from which ſtreams of light and glory iſſue to remote times and ages; while their commemoration, by the pen of hiſtorians and poets, awakens in diſtant boſoms the ſparks of kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred excellence.</p>
            <p>Combine the frequent and familiar perpetration of atrocious deeds, with the dearth of great and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous actions, and you have the exact picture of that condition of ſociety, which completes the degradation of the ſpecies; the frightful contraſt of dwarfiſh vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:037564_0020_100ED2869E53E2B0"/>and gigantic vices, where every thing good is mean and little, and every thing evil is rank and luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riant; a dead and ſickening uniformity prevails, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken only at intervals by volcanic eruptions of anarchy and crime.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Hitherto we have conſidered the influence of Scepticiſm on the principles of virtue; and have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to ſhew that it deſpoils it of its dignity, and lays its authority in the duſt: its influence on the formation of character remains to be examined. The actions of men are oftener determined by their charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than their intereſt: their conduct takes its colour more from their acquired taſte, inclinations and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, than from a deliberate regard to their greateſt good. It is only on great occaſions the mind awakes, to take an extended ſurvey of her whole courſe, and that ſhe ſuffers the dictates of reaſon to impreſs a new bias upon her movements; the actions of each day are, for the moſt part, links which follow each other in the chain of cuſtom. Hence the great effort of practical wiſdom is to imbue the mind with right taſtes, affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and habits; the elements of character, and maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of action.</p>
            <p>The excluſion of a Supreme Being and of a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intending Providence, tends directly to the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of moral taſte. It robs the univerſe of all finiſhed and conſummate excellence, even in idea. The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of perfect wiſdom and goodneſs, for which we are formed, and which kindles ſuch unſpeakable rapture in the ſoul, finding in the regions of ſcepticiſm nothing to which it correſponds, droops and languiſhes. In a world which preſents a fair ſpectacle of order and beauty, of a vaſt family nouriſhed and ſupported by an Almighty parent, in a world which leads the devout mind, ſtep by ſtep, to the contemplation of the firſt fair and the firſt good, the ſceptic is encompaſſed with nothing but obſcurity, meanneſs, and diſorder.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:037564_0021_100EDCA44786E910"/>
When we reflect on the manner in which the idea of Deity is formed, we muſt be convinced that ſuch an idea, intimately preſent to the mind, muſt have a moſt powerful effect in refining the moral taſte. Compoſed of the richeſt elements, it embraces, in the character of a beneficent parent, and Almighty ruler, whatever is venerable in wiſdom, whatever is awful in authority, whatever is touching in goodneſs.</p>
            <p>Human excellence is blended with many imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſeen under many limitations; it is beheld only in detached and ſeparate portions, nor ever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in any one character whole and entire: ſo that, when, in imitation of the ſtoics, we wiſh to form out of theſe fragments the notion of a perfectly wiſe and good man, we know it is a mere fiction of the mind, without any real being in whom it is embodied and realized. In the belief of a Deity theſe conceptions are reduced to reality: the ſcattered rays of an ideal excellence are concentrated, and become the real at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of that Being with whom we ſtand in the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt relation, who ſits Supreme at the head of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, is armed with infinite power, and pervades all nature with his preſence.</p>
            <p>The efficacy of theſe ſentiments, in producing and augmenting a virtuous taſte, will indeed be proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the vividneſs with which they are formed, and the frequency with which they recur; yet ſome benefit will not fail to reſult from them even in their loweſt degree.</p>
            <p>The idea of the ſupreme Being, has this peculiar pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, that as it admits of no ſubſtitute, ſo from the firſt moment it is impreſſed, it is capable of continual growth and enlargement. God himſelf is immutable; but our conception of his character is continually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving freſh acceſſions, is continually growing more extended and refulgent, by having transferred upon it new perceptions of beauty and goodneſs, by attracting to itſelf, as a centre, whatever bears the impreſs of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, order or happineſs. It borrows ſplendour from
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:037564_0022_100EDCA608F22940"/>all that is fair, ſubordinates to itſelf all that is great, and ſits enthroned on the riches of the univerſe.</p>
            <p>As the object of worſhip will always be, in a degree, the object of imitation, hence ariſes a fixed ſtandard of moral excellence, by the contemplation of which the tendencies to corruption are counteracted, the conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of bad example is checked, and human nature riſes above its natural level.</p>
            <p>When the knowledge of God was loſt in the world, juſt ideas of virtue and moral obligation diſappeared along with it. How is it to be otherwiſe accounted for, that in the poliſhed nations, and in the enlightened times of Pagan antiquity, the moſt unnatural luſts and deteſtable impurities were not only tolerated in private life,<note n="*" place="bottom">It is worthy of obſervation, that the elegant and philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phic <hi>Xenophon,</hi> in delineating the model of a perfect Prince in the character of Cyrus, introduces a Mede who had formed an unnatural paſſion for his hero, and relates the incident in a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feſtive humour, without being in the leaſt conſcious of any indelicacy attached to it. What muſt be the ſtate of manners in a country where a circumſtance of this kind, feigned, no doubt, by way of ornament, finds a place in ſuch a work?

The reaſon is this—the true character of God was unknown to the former, which, by the light of divine revelation, was imparted to the latter. The former caſt their deities in the mould of their own immagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in conſequence of which they partook of the vices and defects of their worſhippers: to the latter, no ſcope was left for the wanderings of fancy, but a pure and perfect model was preſcribed.</p>
            <p>Falſe and corrupt, however, as was the religion of the Pagans (if it deſerve the name) and defective, and often vicious, as was the character of their imaginary deities, it was ſtill better for the world, for the void of knowledge to be filled with theſe, than abandoned to a total Scepticiſm; for if both ſyſtems are equally falſe, they are not equally pernicious. When the fictions of heatheniſm conſecrated the memory of its legiſlators and heroes, it inveſted them for the moſt part with thoſe qualities which were in the greateſt repute. They were ſuppoſed to poſſeſs in the higheſt degree the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues in which it was moſt honourable to excel, and to be the witneſſes, approvers and patrons of thoſe perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in others, by which their own character was chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtinguiſhed. Men ſaw, or rather fancied they ſaw, in theſe ſuppoſed deities, the qualities they moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired dilated to a larger ſize, moving in a higher ſphere, and aſſociated with the power, dignity and happineſs of ſuperior natures. With ſuch ideal models before them, and conceiving themſelves continually acting under the eye of ſuch ſpectators and judges, they felt a real eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; their eloquence became more impaſſioned, their patriotiſm inflamed and their courage exalted.</p>
            <p>Revelation, by diſplaying the true character of God, affords a pure and perfect ſtandard of virtue; heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm, one in many reſpects defective and vicious; the faſhionable ſcepticiſm of the preſent day, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the belief of all ſuperior powers, affords no ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard at all. Human nature knows nothing better or higher than itſelf. All above and around it being
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:037564_0024_100EDCA9B4E38D00"/>ſhrouded in darkneſs, and the proſpect confined to the tame realities of life, virtue has no room upwards to expand, nor are any excurſions permitted into that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen world, the true element of the great and good, by which it is fortified with motives equally calculated to ſatisfy the reaſon, to delight the fancy, and to impreſs the heart.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Modern Infidelity not only tends to corrupt the moral taſte; it alſo promotes the growth of thoſe vices which are the moſt hoſtile to ſocial happineſs. Of all the vices incident to human nature, the moſt deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to ſociety are vanity, ferocity, and unbridled ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality; and theſe are preciſely the vices which Infidelity is calculated to cheriſh.</p>
            <p>That the love, fear, and habitual contemplation of a being infinitely exalted, or in other words, devotion is adapted to promote a ſober and moderate eſtimate of our own excellencies, is inconteſtible; nor is it leſs evident that the excluſion of ſuch ſentiments muſt be favorable to pride. The criminality of pride will, perhaps, be leſs readily admitted; for though there is no vice ſo oppoſite to the ſpirit of Chriſtianity, yet there is none which, even in the Chriſtian world, has, under various pretences, been treated with ſo much indulgence.</p>
            <p>There is, it will be confeſſed, a delicate ſenſibility to character, a ſober deſire of reputation, a wiſh to poſſeſs the eſteem of the wiſe and good, felt by the pureſt minds, and which is at the fartheſt remove from arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance or vanity. The humility of a noble mind ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dares to approve of itſelf, until it has ſecured the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of others. Very different is that reſtleſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of diſtinction, that paſſion for theatrical diſplay, which inflames the heart and occupies the whole atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of vain men. This, of all the paſſions, is the moſt unſocial, avarice itſelf not excepted. The reaſon is plain. Property is a kind of good, which may be more eaſily attained, and is capable of more minute ſubdivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, than fame. In the purſuit of wealth, men are led
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:037564_0025_100EDCAB679CFDC0"/>by an attention to their own intereſt to promote the welfare of each other; their advantages are reciprocal; the benefits which each is anxious to acquire for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he reaps in the greateſt abundance from the union and conjunction of ſociety. The purſuits of vanity are quite contrary. The portion of time and attention mankind are willing to ſpare from their avocations and pleaſures, to devote to the admiration of each other is ſo ſmall, that every ſucceſsful adventurer is felt to have impaired the common ſtock. The ſucceſs of one is the diſappointment of multitudes. For though there be many rich, many virtuous, many wiſe men, fame muſt neceſſarily be the portion of but few. Hence every vain man, every man in whom vanity is the ruling paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, regarding his rival as his enemy, is ſtrongly tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to rejoice in his miſcarriage and repine at his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</p>
            <p>Beſides, as the paſſions are ſeldom ſeen in a ſimple, unmixed ſtate, ſo vanity, when it ſucceeds, degenerates into arrogance; when it is diſappointed (and it is oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en diſappointed) it is exaſperated into malignity and corrupted into envy. In this ſtage the vain man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mences a determined miſanthrophiſt. He deteſts that excellence which he cannot reach. He deteſts his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and longs to be revenged for the unpardonable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice he has ſuſtained in their inſenſibility to his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. He lives upon the calamities of the world: the vices and miſeries of men are his element and his food.</p>
            <p>Virtue, talents and genius are his natural enemies, which he perſecutes with inſtinctive eagerneſs, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relenting hoſtility. There are who doubt the exiſtence of ſuch a diſpoſition; but it certainly iſſues out of the dregs of diſappointed vanity: a diſeaſe which taints and vitiates the whole character wherever it prevails. It forms the heart to ſuch a profound indifference to the welfare of others, that whatever appearances he may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, or however wide the circle of his ſeeming vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues may extend, you will infallibly find the vain man
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:037564_0026_100EDCAD352817E0"/>is his own centre. Attentive only to himſelf, abſorbed in the contemplation of his own perfections, inſtead of feeling tenderneſs for his fellow creatures as members of the ſame family, as beings with whom he is appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to act, to ſuffer, and to ſympathize; he conſiders life as a ſtage on which he is performing a part, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in no other light than ſpectators. Whether he ſmiles or frowns, whether his path is adorned with the rays of benificence or his ſteps are died in blood, an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to ſelf is the ſpring of every movement, and the motive to which every action is referred.</p>
            <p>His apparent good qualities loſe all their worth, by loſing all that is ſimple, genuine and natural: they are even preſſed into the ſervice of vanity, and become the means of enlarging its power. The truly good man is jealous over himſelf, leſt the notoriety of his beſt actions by blending itſelf with their motive, ſhould diminiſh their value; the vain man performs the ſame actions for the ſake of that notoriety. The good man quietly diſcharges his duty and ſhuns oſtentation; the vain man conſiders every good deed loſt that is not publicly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played. The one is intent upon realities, the other up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſemblances: the one aims to <hi>be</hi> virtuous, the other to <hi>appear</hi> ſo.</p>
            <p>Nor is a mind inflated with vanity more diſqualified for right action than juſt ſpeculation; or better diſpoſed to the purſuit of truth than the practice of virtue. To ſuch a mind the ſimplicity of truth is diſguſting. Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of the improvement of mankind, and intent only upon aſtoniſhing with the appearance of novelty, the glare of paradox will be preferred to the light of truth; opinions will be embraced, not becauſe they are juſt, but becauſe they are new: the more flagitious, the more ſubverſive of morals, the more alarming to the wiſe and good, the more welcome to men who eſtimate their literary powers by the miſchief they produce, and who conſider the anxiety and terror they impreſs as the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of their renown. Truth is ſimple and uniform,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:037564_0027_100EDCAF694045B0"/>while error may be infinitely varied; and as it is one thing to ſtart paradoxes, and another to make diſcoveries, we need the leſs wonder at the prodigious increaſe of modern philoſophers.</p>
            <p>We have been ſo much accuſtomed to conſider ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant ſelf-eſtimation merely as a <hi>ridiculous</hi> quality, that many will be ſurpriſed to find it treated as a vice, pregnant with ſerious miſchief to ſociety. But, to form a judgment of its influence on the manners and happineſs of a nation, it is neceſſary only to look at its effects in a family; for bodies of men are only collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of individuals, and the greateſt nation is nothing more than an aggregate of a number of families. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of a domeſtic circle, in which each member is elated with a moſt extravagant opinion of himſelf, and a proportionable contempt of every other, is full of little contrivances to catch applauſe, and whenever he is not praiſed is ſullen and diſappointed—what a picture of diſunion, diſguſt, and animoſity would ſuch a family preſent; how utterly would domeſtic affection be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, and all the purpoſes of domeſtic ſociety be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated! The general prevalence of ſuch diſpoſitions muſt be accompanied by an equal proportion of general miſery. The tendency of pride to produce ſtrife and hatred, is ſufficiently apparent, from the pains men have been at to conſtruct a ſyſtem of politeneſs, which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than a ſort of mimic humility, in which the ſentiments of an offenſive ſelf-eſtimation are ſo far diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed and ſuppreſſed, as to make them compatible with the ſpirit of ſociety; ſuch a mode of behaviour as would naturally reſult from an attention to the apoſtolic in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction: <hi>Let nothing be done through strife or vain glory: but, in lowliness of mind, let each esteem other better than themselves.</hi> But if the ſemblance is of ſuch importance, how much more uſeful the reality: if the mere garb of humility is of ſuch indiſpenſible neceſſity, that without it ſociety could not ſubſiſt, how much better ſtill would the harmony of the world be preſerved, were
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:037564_0028_100EDCB155EFE7E0"/>the condeſcenſion, deference, and reſpect, ſo ſtudiouſly diſplayed, a true picture of the heart?</p>
            <p>The ſame reſtleſs and eager vanity which diſturbs a family, when it is permitted in a great national criſis to mingle with political affairs, diſtracts a kingdom; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing into thoſe entruſted with the enaction of laws a ſpirit of raſh innovation and daring empiriciſm, a diſdain of the eſtabliſhed uſages of mankind, a fooliſh deſire to dazzle the world with new and untried ſyſtems of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, in which the precedents of antiquity and the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of ages are only conſulted to be trodden under foot; and into the executive department of government, a fierce contention for pre-eminence, an inceſſant ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle to ſupplant and deſtroy, with a propenſity to calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and ſuſpicion, proſcription and maſſacre.</p>
            <p>We ſhall ſuffer the moſt eventful ſeaſon ever witneſſed in the affairs of men, to paſs over our heads to very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle purpoſe, if we fail to learn from it ſome awful leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons on the nature and progreſs of the paſſions. The true light, in which the French revolution ought to be contemplated, is that of a grand experiment on human nature. Among the various paſſions which that revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has ſo ſtrikingly diſplayed, none is more conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than vanity; nor is it difficult, without adverting to the national character of the people, to account for its extraordinary predominance. Political power, the moſt ſeducing object of ambition, never before circulated through ſo many hands; the proſpect of poſſeſſing it was never before preſented to ſo many minds. Multitudes, who by their birth and education, and not unfrequently by their talents, ſeemed deſtined to perpetual obſcurity, were, by the alternate riſe and fall of parties, elevated into diſtinction, and ſnared in the functions of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The ſhort-lived forms of power and office glid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch rapidity through ſucceſſive ranks of degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, from the court to the very dregs of the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, that they ſeemed rather to ſolicit acceptance, than

               </note>: yet, as it was ſtill impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for all to poſſeſs authority, though none were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to obey, a general impatience to break the ranks and ruſh into the foremoſt ground, maddened and infuriated the nation, and overwhelmed law, order, and civiliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with the violence of a torrent.</p>
            <p>If ſuch be the miſchiefs both in public and private life reſulting from an exceſſive ſelf-eſtimation, it remains next to be conſidered whether providence has ſupplied any medicine to correct it; for as the reflection on ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies, whether real or imaginary, is always attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with pleaſure to the poſſeſſor, it is a diſeaſe deeply ſeated in our nature.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe there were a great and glorious Being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways preſent with us, who had given us exiſtence with numberleſs other bleſſings, and on whom we depended each inſtant, as well for every preſent enjoyment as for every future good; ſuppoſe again, we had incurred the juſt diſpleaſure of ſuch a Being, by ingratitude and diſobedience, yet that in great mercy he had not caſt us off, but had aſſured us he was willing to pardon and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore us, on our humble intreaty and ſincere repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; ſay, would not an habitual ſenſe of the preſence of this Being, ſelf-reproach for having diſpleaſed him, and an anxiety to recover his favour, be the moſt effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual antidote to pride? But ſuch are the leading diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries made by the Chriſtian Revelation, and ſuch the diſpoſitions which a practical belief of it inſpires.</p>
            <p>Humility is the firſt fruit of religion. In the mouth of our Lord there is no maxim ſo frequent as the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, <hi>Whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased, and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.</hi> Religion, and that alone, teaches <hi>absolute</hi> humility, by which I mean a ſenſe of our <hi>absolute</hi> nothingneſs in the view of
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:037564_0030_100EDCB5227BB688"/>infinite greatneſs and excellence. That ſenſe of inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority, which reſults from the compariſon of men with each other, is often an unwelcome ſentiment forced up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the mind, which may rather embitter the temper than ſoften it: that which devotion impreſſes, is ſooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and delightful. The devout man loves to lie low at the footſtool of his Creator, becauſe it is then he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the moſt lively perceptions of the divine excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and the moſt tranquil confidence in the divine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. In ſo auguſt a preſence, he ſees all diſtinctions loſt, and all beings reduced to the ſame level: he looks at his ſuperiors without envy, and his inferiors without contempt; and when from this elevation he deſcends to mix in ſociety, the conviction of ſuperiority, which muſt in many inſtances be felt, is a calm inference of the underſtanding, and no longer a buſy, importunate paſſion of the heart.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The wicked,</hi> ſays the Pſalmiſt, <hi>through the pride of their countenance, will not seek after God: God is not in all their thoughts.</hi> When we conſider the incredible vanity of the Atheiſtical ſect, together with the ſettled malignity, and unrelenting rancour with which they purſue every veſtige of religion—is it uncandid to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that its humbling tendency is one principal cauſe of their enmity; that they are eager to diſplace a Deity from the minds of men, that they may occupy the void; to crumble the throne of the Eternal into duſt, that they may elevate themſelves on its ruins; and that, as their licentiouſneſs is impatient of reſtraint, ſo their pride diſdains a ſuperior?</p>
            <p>We mentioned a ferocity of character, as one effect of ſceptical impiety. It is an inconvenience attending a controverſy with thoſe with whom we have few prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in common, that we are often in danger of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inconcluſively, for the want of its being clearly known and ſettled what our opponents admit, and what they deny. The perſons, for example, with whom we are at preſent engaged, have diſcarded humility and
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:037564_0031_100EDCB6B25C45E0"/>modeſty from the catalogue of virtues; on which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count we have employed the more time in evincing their importance; but whatever may be thought of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility as a <hi>virtue,</hi> it ſurely will not be denied that inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity is a moſt deteſtable <hi>vice;</hi> a vice, however, which ſcepticiſm has a moſt powerful tendency to inflame.</p>
            <p>As we have already ſhewn that pride hardens the heart, and that Religion is the only effectual antidote, the connection between irreligion and inhumanity is, in this view, obvious. But there is another light in which this part of the ſubject may be viewed, in my humble opinion, much more important, though ſeldom adverted to. The ſuppoſition that man is a moral and accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble being, deſtined to ſurvive the ſtroke of death, and to live in a future world in a never ending ſtate of happineſs or miſery, makes him a creature of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably more <hi>consequence,</hi> than the oppoſite ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. When we conſider him as placed here by an Almighty Ruler, in a ſtate of probation, and that the preſent life is his period of trial, the firſt link in a vaſt and interminable chain which ſtretches into eternity, he aſſumes a dignified character in our eyes. Every thing which relates to him becomes inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting; and to trifle with his happineſs is felt to be the moſt unpardonable levity. If ſuch be the deſtination of man, it is evident, that, in the qualities which fit him for it, his principal dignity conſiſts: his moral great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is his true greatneſs. Let the ſceptical principles be admitted, which repreſent him, on the contrary, as the offspring of chance, connected with no ſuperior pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and ſinking into annihilation at death, and he is a contemptible creature, whoſe exiſtence and happineſs are inſignificant. The characteriſtic difference is loſt betwixt him and the brute creation, from which he is no longer diſtinguiſhed, except by the vividneſs and muli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of his perceptions.</p>
            <p>If we reflect on that part of our nature which diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es us to humanity, we ſhall find that, where we have no particular attachment, our ſympathy with the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:037564_0032_100EDCB8ED7EE578"/>and concern for the deſtruction of ſenſitive beings, is in proportion to their ſuppoſed importance in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſcale; or, in other words, to their ſuppoſed capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of enjoyment. We feel, for example, much more at witneſſing the deſtruction of a man than of an inferior animal, becauſe we conſider it as involving the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of a much greater ſum of happineſs. For the ſame reaſon, he who would ſhudder at the ſlaughter of a large animal, will ſee a thouſand inſects periſh without a pang. Our ſympathy with the calamities of our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-creatures is adjuſted to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> proportions: for we feel more powerfully affected with the diſtreſſes of fallen greatneſs, than with equal or greater diſtreſſes ſuſtained by perſons of inferior rank; becauſe, having been accuſtomed to aſſociate with an elevated ſtation the idea of ſuperior happineſs, the loſs appears the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the wreck more extenſive. But the diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in importance, betwixt man and the meaneſt inſect, is not ſo great, as that which ſubſiſts betwixt man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as <hi>mortal</hi> and as <hi>immortal;</hi> that is, betwixt man as he is repreſented by the ſyſtem of Scepticiſm and that of Divine Revelation: for the enjoyment of the meaneſt inſect bears ſome proportion, though a very ſmall one, to the preſent happineſs of man; but the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of time bears none at all to that of eternity. The Sceptical ſyſtem, therefore, ſinks the importance of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man exiſtence to an inconceivable degree.</p>
            <p>From theſe principles reſults the following important inference, that, to extinguiſh human life by the hand of violence, muſt be quite a different thing in the eyes of a Sceptic from what it is in thoſe of a Chriſtian. With the Sceptic it is nothing more than diverting the courſe of a little red fluid called blood; it is merely leſſening the number by one of many millions of fugitive contemptible creatures: the Chriſtian ſees, in the ſame event, an accountable being cut off from a ſtate of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, and hurried, perhaps unprepared, into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his Judge, to hear that final, that irrevocable
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:037564_0033_100EDCBAAB01EB10"/>ſentence, which is to fix him for ever in an unalterable condition of felicity or woe. The former perceives in death nothing but its phyſical circumſtances; the latter is impreſſed with the magnitude of its moral conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. It is the moral relation which man is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to bear to a ſuperior power, the awful idea of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countability, the influence which his preſent diſpoſitions and actions are conceived to have upon his eternal deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny, more than any ſuperiority of intellectual powers, abſtracted from theſe conſiderations, which inveſt him with ſuch myſterious grandeur, and conſtitute the firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt guard on the ſanctuary of human life. This rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, it is true, ſerves more <hi>immediately</hi> to ſhew how the diſbelief of a future ſtate endangers the ſecurity of life; but though this be its <hi>direct</hi> conſequence, it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends by analogy much farther: ſince he, who has learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſport with the <hi>lives</hi> of his fellow-creatures, will feel but little ſolicitude for their welfare in any other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; but, as the greater includes the leſs, will eaſily paſs from this to all the inferior gradations of barbarity.</p>
            <p>As the advantage of the armed over the unarmed is not ſeen till the moment of attack, ſo in that tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quil ſtate of ſociety, in which law and order main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their aſcendancy, it is not perceived, perhaps not even ſuſpected, to what an alarming degree the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of modern infidelity leave us naked and defence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. But, let the ſtate be convulſed, let the mounds of regular authority be once overflowed, and the ſtill ſmall voice of law, drowned in the tempeſt of popular fury (events which recent experience ſhews to be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) it will then be ſeen that atheiſm is a ſchool of ferocity; and that having taught its diſciples to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mankind as little better than a neſt of inſects, they will be prepared, in the fierce conflicts of party, to trample upon them without pity, and extinguiſh them without remorſe.</p>

The only doubt that can ariſe is, whether the barbarities which have ſtained the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in that unhappy country are juſtly chargeable to the prevalence of atheiſm. Let thoſe who doubt of this recollect that the men, who, by their activity and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, prepared the minds of the people for that great change, <hi>Voltaire, D' Alembert, Diderot, Rosseau,</hi> and others, were avowed enemies of Revelation; that, in all their writings, the diffuſion of ſcepticiſm and of revolutionary principles went hand in hand; that the fury of the moſt ſanguinary parties was eſpecially point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the Chriſtian prieſthood and religious inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, without once pretending, like other perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, to execute the vengeance of God (whoſe name they never mentioned) upon his enemies; that their atrocities were committed with a wanton levity and brutal merriment; that the reign of atheiſm was avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly and expreſsly the reign of terror; that in the full madneſs of their career, in the higheſt climax of their horrors, they ſhut up the temples of God, aboliſhed his worſhip, and proclaimed death to be an eternal ſleep; as if, by pointing to the ſilence of the ſepulchre, and the ſleep of the dead, theſe ferocious barbarians
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:037564_0035_100EDCBE6EF5D9C0"/>meant to apologiſe for leaving neither ſleep, quiet, nor repoſe to the living.</p>
            <p>As the heathens fabled that Minerva iſſued full armed from the head of Jupiter; ſo no ſooner were the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations of atheiſtical philoſophy matured, than they gave birth to a ferocity which converted the moſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed people in Europe into a horde of aſſaſſins; the ſeat of voluptuous refinement, of pleaſure and of arts, into a theatre of blood.</p>
            <p>Having already ſhewn, that the principles of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity facilitate the commiſſion of crimes by removing the reſtraints of fear, and that they foſter the arrogance of the individual, while they inculcate the moſt deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picable opinion of the ſpecies; the inevitable reſult is, that a haughty ſelf-confidence, a contempt of mankind, together with a daring defiance of religious reſtraints, are the natural ingredients of the atheiſtical character; nor is it leſs evident that theſe are, of all others, the diſpoſitions which moſt forcibly ſtimulate to violence and cruelty.</p>
            <p>Settle it, therefore, in your minds, as a maxim ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be effaced or forgotten, that atheiſm is an inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, bloody, ferocious ſyſtem, equally hoſtile to every uſeful reſtraint, and to every virtuous affection; that, leaving nothing above us to excite awe, nor around us to awaken tenderneſs, it wages war with heaven and with earth; its firſt object is to dethrone God, its next to deſtroy man<note n="*" place="bottom">As human nature is the ſame in all ages, it is not ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing to find the ſame moral ſyſtems, even in the moſt diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar circumſtances, produce correſponding effects. <hi>Josephus</hi> remarks, that the Sadducees, a kind of Jewiſh infidels, whoſe tenets were the denial of moral government and a future ſtate, were diſtinguiſhed from the other ſects by their fero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. <hi>De Bell.

There is a third vice, not leſs deſtructive to ſociety than either of thoſe which have been already mentioned, to which the ſyſtem of modern infidelity is favourable; that is, unbridled ſenſuality, the licentious and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained indulgence of thoſe paſſions which are eſſential to the continuation of the ſpecies. The magnitude of theſe paſſions, and the ſupreme importance to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence as well as the peace and welfare of ſociety, have rendered it one of the firſt objects of ſolicitude with every wiſe legiſlature, to reſtrain them by ſuch laws, and to confine their indulgence within ſuch li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, as ſhall beſt promote the great ends for which they were implanted.</p>
            <p>The benevolence and wiſdom of the author of Chriſtianity are eminently conſpicuous in the laws he has enacted on this branch of morals; for, while he authoriſes marriage, he reſtrains the vagrancy and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>price of the paſſions, by forbidding polygamy and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce; and, well knowing that offences againſt the laws of chaſtity uſually ſpring from an ill-regulated imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he inculcates purity of heart. Among innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable benefits which the world has derived from the Chriſtian religion, a ſuperior refinement in the ſexual ſentiments, a more equal and reſpectful treatment of women, greater dignity and permanence conferred on the inſtitution of marriage, are not the leaſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; in conſequence of which the pureſt affections, and the moſt ſacred duties, are grafted on the ſtock of the ſtrongeſt inſtincts.</p>
            <p>The aim of all the leading champions of infidelity is, to rob mankind of theſe benefits, and throw them back into a ſtate of groſs and brutal ſenſuality. Mr. <hi>Hume</hi> aſſerts adultery to be but a ſlight offence <hi>when known, when secret,</hi> no crime at all. In the ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit he repreſents the private conduct of the profligate <hi>Charles,</hi> whoſe debaucheries polluted the age, as a juſt ſubject of panegyric. A diſciple in the ſame ſchool has lately had the unbluſhing effrontery to ſtigmatiſe
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:037564_0037_100EDCC20151FB70"/>marriage as the worſt of all monopolies; and, in a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative of his licentious amours, to make a formal apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy for departing from his principles, by ſubmitting to its reſtraints. The popular productions on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, which iſſue from the atheiſtical ſchool, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly directed to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Under every poſſible aſpect in which infidelity can be viewed, it extends the dominion of ſenſuality; it repeals and abrogates every law by which divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation has, under ſuch awful ſanctions, reſtrained the indulgence of the paſſions; the diſbelief of a Supreme Omniſcient Being which it inculcates, releaſes its diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples from an attention to the <hi>heart,</hi> from every care but the preſervation of outward decorum; and the excluſion of the devout affections and an unſeen world, leaves the mind immerſed in viſible, ſenſible objects.</p>
            <p>There are two ſorts of pleaſures, corporeal and mental: Though we are indebted to the ſenſes for all our perceptions <hi>originally,</hi> yet thoſe which are at the fartheſt remove from their <hi>immediate impressions,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the moſt elevation of the character; ſince, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as they are multiplied and augmented, the ſlaviſh ſubjection to the ſenſes is ſubdued. Hence the true and only antidote to debaſing ſenſuality is, the poſſeſſion of a fund of that <hi>kind of enjoyment</hi> which is independent of the corporeal appetites. Inferior in the perfection of ſeveral of his ſenſes to different parts of the brute creation, the ſuperiority of man over them all conſiſts in his ſuperior power of multiplying, by new combinations, his mental perceptions, and thereby of creating to himſelf reſources of happineſs, ſeparate from external ſenſation. In the ſcale of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the firſt remove from ſenſe are the pleaſures of reaſon and ſociety; the next, are the pleaſures of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion and religion. The former, though totally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct from thoſe of ſenſe, are yet leſs perfectly adapted to moderate their exceſſes than the laſt; as they are in
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:037564_0038_100EDCC3DD778888"/>a great meaſure converſant with viſible and ſenſible ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.—The religious affections and ſentiments are, in fact, and were intended to be the <hi>proper antagonist</hi> of ſenſuality, the great deliverer from the thraldom of the appetites; by opening a ſpiritual world, and inſpiring hopes, and fears, and conſolations, and joys, which bear no relation to the material and ſenſible univerſe. The criminal indulgence of ſenſual paſſions admits but of two modes of prevention; the eſtabliſhment of ſuch laws and maxims in ſociety as ſhall render lewd profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy impracticable or infamous, or, the infuſion of ſuch principles and habits as ſhall render it diſtaſteful: human legiſlatures have encountered the diſeaſe in the firſt, the truths and ſanctions of revealed religion, in the laſt, of theſe methods: to both of which the advocates of modern infidelity are equally hoſtile.</p>
            <p>So much has been ſaid by many able writers to evince the inconceivable benefits of the marriage inſtitution, that to hear it ſeriouſly attacked by men who ſtile themſelves philoſophers, at the cloſe of the eighteenth century, muſt awaken indignation and ſurpriſe. The object of this diſcourſe leads us to direct our attention particularly to the influence of this inſtitution on the <hi>civilization</hi> of the world.</p>
            <p>From the records of Revelation we learn, that mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, or the <hi>permanent union</hi> of the ſexes, was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by God, and exiſted under different modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the early infancy of mankind, without which they could never have emerged from barbariſm. For, conceive only what eternal diſcord, jealouſy, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence would enſue, were the objects of the tendereſt affections ſecured to their poſſeſſor by no law or tie of moral obligation; were domeſtic enjoyments diſturbed by inceſſant fear, and licentiouſneſs inflamed by hope. Who could find ſufficient tranquillity of mind, to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him to plan or execute any continued ſcheme of action, or what room for arts, or ſciences, or religion, or virtue, in that ſtate in which the chief earthly happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:037564_0039_100EDCC61D2E3318"/>was expoſed to every lawleſs invader: where one was racked with an inceſſant anxiety to keep what the other was equally eager to acquire? It is not probable in itſelf, independent of the light of ſcripture, that the benevolent author of the human race ever placed them in ſo wretched a condition at firſt: it is certain they could not remain in it long without being exterminated. Marriage, by ſhutting out theſe evils, and enabling every man to reſt ſecure in his enjoyments, is the great civilizer of the world; with this ſecurity the mind is at liberty to expand in generous affections, has leiſure to look abroad, and engage in the purſuits of knowledge, ſcience, and virtue.</p>
            <p>Nor is it in this way only that marriage inſtitutions are eſſential to the welfare of mankind. They are ſources of tenderneſs, as well as the guardians of peace. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the permanent union of the ſexes, there can be no permanent families: the diſſolution of nuptial ties in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves the diſſolution of domeſtic ſociety. But do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic ſociety is the ſeminary of ſocial affections, the cradle of ſenſibility, where the firſt elements are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of that tenderneſs and humanity, which cement mankind together, and which, were they entirely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed, the whole fabric of ſocial inſtitutions would be diſſolved.</p>
            <p>Families are ſo many centres of attraction, which preſerve mankind from being ſcattered and diſſipated by the repulſive powers of ſelfiſhneſs. The order of nature is, evermore, from particulars to generals. As, in the operations of intellect, we proceed from the contemplation of individuals to the formation of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral abſtractions, ſo in the developement of the paſſions in like manner, we advance from private to public af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, from the love of parents, brothers, and ſiſters, to thoſe more expanded regards which embrace the immenſe ſociety of human kind<note n="*" place="bottom">Arcti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

In order to render men benevolent, they muſt firſt be made tender: for benevolent affections are not the offspring of reaſoning; they reſult from that culture of the heart, from thoſe early impreſſions of tenderneſs, gratitude, and ſympathy, which the endearments of domeſtic life are ſure to ſupply, and for the formation of which it is the beſt poſſible ſchool.</p>
            <p>The advocates of infidelity invert this eternal order of nature. Inſtead of inculcating the private affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as a diſcipline by which the mind is prepared for thoſe of a more public nature, they ſet them in direct oppoſition to each other; they propoſe to build general benevolence on the deſtruction of individual tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to make us love the whole ſpecies more, by loving every particular part of it leſs. In purſuit of this chimerical project, gratitude, humility, conjugal, parental, and filial affection, together with every other ſocial diſpoſition, are reprobated; virtue is limited to a paſſionate attachment to the general good. Is it not natural to aſk, when all the tenderneſs of life is extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, and all the bands of ſociety are untwiſted, from whence this ardent affection for the general good is to ſpring?</p>
            <p>When this ſavage philoſophy has completed its work, when it has taught its diſciple to look with perfect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference on the offspring of his body and the wife of his boſom, to eſtrange himſelf from his friends, inſult his benefactors, and ſilence the pleadings of gratitude and pity, will he by thus diveſting himſelf of all that is human, be better prepared for the diſintereſted love of his ſpecies? Will he become a philanthropiſt only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he has ceaſed to be a man? Rather in this total
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:037564_0041_100EDCCA4D736BA0"/>exemption from all the feelings which humanize and ſoften, in this chilling froſt of univerſal indifference, may we not be certain ſelfiſhneſs, unmingled and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controuled, will aſſume the empire of his heart; and that under pretence of advancing the general good, an object to which the fancy may give innumerable ſhapes, he will be prepared for the violation of every duty, and the perpetration of every crime? Extended benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence is the laſt and moſt perfect fruit of the private affections; ſo that to expect to reap the former from the extinction of the latter, is to oppoſe the means to the end; is as abſurd as to attempt to reach the ſummit of the higheſt mountain, without paſſing through the intermediate ſpaces, or to hope to attain the heights of ſcience by forgetting the firſt elements of knowledge. Theſe abſurdities have ſprung, however, in the advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates of infidelity, from an ignorance of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſufficient to diſgrace even thoſe who did not ſtile themſelves philoſophers. Preſuming, contrary to the experience of every moment, that the affections are awakened by <hi>reasoning,</hi> and perceiving that the general good is an incomparably greater <hi>object in itself,</hi> than the happineſs of any limited number of individuals, they inferred that nothing more was neceſſary than to exhibit it in its juſt dimenſions, to draw the <hi>affections</hi> towards it; as though the fact of the ſuperior popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſneſs of China to Great Britain, needed but to be known, to render us indifferent to our domeſtic con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, and lead us to direct all our anxiety, to the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of that vaſt, but remote empire.</p>
            <p>It is not the province of reaſon to awaken new paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, or open new ſources of ſenſibility, but to direct us in the attainment of thoſe objects which nature has already rendered pleaſing, or to determine among the interfering inclinations and paſſions which ſway the mind, which are the fitteſt to be preferred.</p>
            <p>Is a regard to the general good then, you will reply, to be excluded from the motives of action? Nothing
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:037564_0042_100EDCCCC220B168"/>is more remote from my intention: but as the nature of this motive has, in my opinion, been much miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by ſome good men, and abuſed by others of a different deſcription, to the worſt of purpoſes, permit me to declare, in a few words, what appears to me to be the truth on this ſubject.</p>
            <p>The welfare of the whole ſyſtem of being muſt be allowed to be, <hi>in itself,</hi> the object of all others the moſt worthy of being purſued; ſo that, could the mind diſtinctly embrace it, and diſcern at every ſtep <hi>what action</hi> would infallibly promote it, we ſhould be furniſhed with a ſure criterion of right and wrong, an unerring guide, which would ſuperſede the uſe and neceſſity of all inferior rules, laws and principles.</p>
            <p>But this being impoſſible, ſince the good of the <hi>whole</hi> is a motive ſo looſe and indeterminate, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces ſuch an infinity of relations, that before we could be certain what action it preſcribed, the ſeaſon of action would be paſt; to weak; ſhort-ſighted mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, Providence has aſſigned a ſphere of agency, leſs grand and extenſive indeed, but better ſuited to their limited powers, by implanting certain <hi>affections</hi> which it is their duty to cultivate, and ſuggeſting particular rules to which they are bound to conform. By theſe proviſions, the boundaries of virtue are eaſily aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, at the ſame time that its ultimate object, the good of the whole, is ſecured; for, ſince the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the entire ſyſtem reſults from the happineſs of the ſeveral parts, the affections, which confine the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention <hi>immediately</hi> to the latter, conſpire in the end to the promotion of the former; as the labourer, whoſe induſtry is limited to a corner of a large building, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms his part towards rearing the ſtructure, much more effectually than if he extened his care to the whole.</p>
            <p>As the intereſt, however, of any limited number of perſons may not only not contribute, but may poſſibly be directly oppoſed to the general good; the intereſt of
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:037564_0043_100EDCCF460A3FD8"/>a family, for example, to that of a province, or, of a nation to that of the world; Providence has ſo order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, that in a well-regulated mind there ſprings up, as we have already ſeen, beſides particular attachments, <hi>an extended regard to the species,</hi> whoſe office is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſold; not to <hi>destroy</hi> and <hi>extinguish</hi> the more private affections, which is mental parricide; but firſt, as far as is conſiſtent with the claims of thoſe who are immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately committed to our care, <hi>to do good to all men;</hi> ſecondly, to exerciſe a jurisdiction and controul over the private affection, ſo as to prohibit their indulgence, whenever it would be attended with <hi>manifest detriment</hi> to the whole. Thus every part of our nature is brought into action; all the practical principles of the human heart find an element to move in, each in its different ſort and manner, conſpiring, without mutual colliſions to maintain the harmony of the world and the happineſs of the univerſe<note n="*" place="bottom">It is ſomewhat ſingular, that many of the faſhionable Infidels have hit upon a definition of virtue which perfectly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incides with that of certain metaphyſical divines in America, firſt invented and defended by that moſt acute reaſoner <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than Edwards.</hi> They both place virtue, excluſively, in a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for the general good, or, as Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> expreſſes it, <hi>love to Being in general;</hi> ſo that our love is always to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to the magnitude of its object in the ſcale of Being; which is liable to the objections I have already ſtated, as well as to many others, which the limits of this note will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to enumerate. Let it ſuffice to remark, 1. That vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, on theſe principles, is an utter impoſſibility: for the ſyſtem of Being, comprehending the great Supreme, is <hi>infinite,</hi> and therefore to maintain the proper proportion, the force of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular attachment muſt be infinitely leſs than the paſſion for the general good; but the limits of the human mind are not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of any emotions ſo infinitely different <hi>in degree.</hi> 2. Since <hi>our views</hi> of the extent of the univerſe are capable of perpetual enlargement, admitting the ſum of exiſtence is ever the ſame, we muſt return back at each ſtep to diminiſh the ſtrength of particular affections, or they will become diſproportionate, and conſequently on theſe principles vicious; ſo that the balance muſt be continually fluctuating, by the weights being taken out of one ſcale and put into the other. 3. If virtue conſiſt <hi>exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively</hi> in love to Being in general, or attachment to the general good, the particular affections are, to every purpoſe of virtue, uſeleſs, and even pernicious; for their immediate, nay their neceſſary tendency is, to attract to their objects a proportion of attention, which far exceeds their comparative value in the general ſcale. To allege that the <hi>general good</hi> is promoted by them will be of no advantage to the defence of this ſyſtem, but the contrary, by confeſſing that a greater ſum of happineſs is attained by a deviation from, than an adherence to, its prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; unleſs its advocates mean, by the love of Being in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, the ſame thing as the private affections, which is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found all the diſtinctions of language, as well as all the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of mind. Let it be remembered, we have no diſpute reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting what is the ultimate end of virtue, which is allowed on both ſides to be the greateſt ſum of happineſs in the univerſe; the queſtion is merely, what is <hi>virtue itſelf?</hi> or, in other words, what are the means appointed for the attainment of that end?
<p>There is little doubt, from ſome parts of Mr. <hi>Godwin's</hi> work, entitled <hi>"Political Juſtice,"</hi> as well as from his early habits of reading, that he was indebted to Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> for his principal arguments againſt the private affections; though, with a daring conſiſtence, he has purſued his principles to an extreme from which that moſt excellent man would have revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with horror. The fundamental error of the whole ſyſtem aroſe, as I conceive, from a miſtaken purſuit of ſimplicity; from a wiſh to conſtruct a moral ſyſtem without leaving ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſcope for the infinite variety of moral phoenomena and mental combination: in conſequence of which, its advocates were induced to place virtue <hi>excluſively</hi> in ſome <hi>one diſpoſition</hi> of mind; and, ſince the paſſion for the general good is undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the <hi>nobleſt</hi> and moſt extenſive of all others, when it was once reſolved to place virtue in any <hi>one thing,</hi> there remained lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle room to heſitate which ſhould be preferred. It might have been worth while to reflect, that in the natural world there are two kinds of attraction; one which holds the ſeveral <hi>parts</hi> of individual bodies in contact; another, which maintains the union of bodies themſelves with the general ſyſtem; and that, though the union in the former caſe is much more <hi>intimate</hi> than in the latter, each is equally eſſential to the order of the world. Similar to this is the relation which the public and private affections bear to each other, and their uſe in the moral ſyſtem.</p>

It is ſcarcely neceſſary to remark, that all the benefits, which might in any way flow from ſuperſtition, are ſecured to an incomparably greater degree by the belief of true Religion.
<p>"But among all the uſeful inſtitutions," ſays <hi>Polybius,</hi> "that demonſtrate the ſuperior excellence of the Roman go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, the moſt conſiderable, perhaps, is the opinion which people are taught to hold concerning the Gods; and that, which other men regard as an object of diſgrace, appears in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be the very thing by which this republic is chiefly ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. I mean ſuperſtition; which is impreſſed with all its terrors, and influences the private actions of the citizens, and the public adminiſtration of the ſtate, to a degree that can ſcarcely be exceeded.</p>
                  <p>"The ancients, therefore, acted not abſurdly, nor without good reaſon, when they inculcated the notions concerning the Gods, and the belief of infernal puniſhments; but much rather <hi>are thoſe of the preſent age to be charged with raſhneſs and abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity</hi> in endeavoring to extirpate theſe opinions; for, not to mention other effects that flow from ſuch an inſtitution, if, among the Greeks, for example, a ſingle talent only be intruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to thoſe who have the management of any of the public mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, though they give ten written ſureties, with as many ſeals, and twice as many witneſſes, they are unable to diſcharge the truſt repoſed in them with integrity. But the Romans, on the other hand, who in the courſe of their magiſtracies and in em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſies diſburſe the greateſt ſums, are prevailed on, by the ſingle obligation of an oath, to perform their duty with inviolable ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty. And as, in other ſtates, a man is rarely to be found whoſe hands are pure from public robbery, ſo, amongſt the Romans, it is no leſs rare to diſcover one that is tainted with this crime."</p>

Of whatever benefit ſuperſtition might formerly be productive, by the ſcattered particles of truth which it contained, theſe advantages can now only be reaped from the ſoil of true Religion; nor is there any other
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:037564_0047_100EDCD69946A460"/>alternative left than the belief of Chriſtianity, or abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Atheiſm. In the revolutions of the human mind, exploded <hi>opinions</hi> are often revived, but an exploded ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition never recovers its credit. The pretenſion to Divine Revelation is ſo auguſt and commanding, that, when its falſehood is once diſcerned, it is covered with all the ignominy of detected impoſture; it falls from ſuch a height (to change the figure) that it is inevitably crumbled into atoms. Religions, whether falſe or true, are not creatures of arbitrary inſtitution. After diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diting the principles of piety, ſhould our modern Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinkers find it neceſſary, in order to reſtrain the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of ferocity, to ſeek for a ſubſtitute in ſome popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſuperſtition, it will prove a vain and impracticable attempt: they may recal the names, reſtore the altars, and revive the ceremonies; but to re-kindle the ſpirit of Heatheniſm will exceed their power; becauſe it is impoſſible to enact ignorance by law, or to repeal, by le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative authority, the dictates of reaſon, and the right of ſcience.</p>

2. The efforts of infidels, to diffuſe the principles of infidelity among the common people, is another alarming ſympton peculiar to the preſent time. <hi>Hume, Bolingbroke</hi> and <hi>Gibbon</hi> addreſſed themſelves ſolely to the more poliſhed claſſes of the community, and would have thought their refined ſpeculations debaſed by an attempt to enliſt diſciples from among the populace. Infidelity has lately grown condeſcending: bred in the ſpeculations of a daring philoſophy, immured at firſt in the cloiſters of the learned, and afterwards nurſed in the lap of voluptuouſneſs and of courts; having at length reached its full maturity, it boldly ventures to challenge the ſuffrages of the people, ſolicits the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of peaſants and mechanics, and ſeeks to draw whole nations to its ſtandard.</p>
            <p>It is not difficult to account for this new ſtate of things. While infidelity was rare, it was employed as the inſtrument of literary vanity; its wide diffuſion having diſqualified it for anſwering that purpoſe, it is now adopted as the organ of political convulſion. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terary diſtinction is conferred by the approbation of a few; but the total ſubverſion and overthrow of ſociety demands the concurrence of millions.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The infidels of the preſent day are the firſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſts who have preſumed to innovate in the very <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> of morals. The diſputes on moral queſtions hitherto agitated amongſt philoſophers have reſpected the <hi>grounds</hi> of duty, not the <hi>nature of duty itself;</hi> or they have been merely metaphyſical, and related to the <hi>history</hi> of moral ſentiments in the mind, the ſources and principles from which they were moſt eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced; they never turned on the quality of thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions and actions which were to be denominated virtuous. In the firm perſuaſion that the love and fear of the Supreme Being, the ſacred obſervation of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and oaths, reverence to magiſtrates, obedience to parents, gratitude to beneſactors, conjugal fidelity, and parental tenderneſs, were primary virtues; and the
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:037564_0049_10117200303AAE00"/>chief ſupport of every commonwealth, they were una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous. The curſe denounced upon ſuch as remove ancient land marks, upon thoſe who call good evil and evil good, put light for darkneſs and darkneſs for light, who employ their faculties to ſubvert the eternal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctions of right and wrong, and thus to poiſon the ſtreams of virtue at their ſource, falls with accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated weight on the advocates of modern infidelity, and on them alone.</p>
            <p>Permit me to cloſe this diſcourſe with a few ſerious reflections. There is much, it muſt be confeſſed, in the apoſtacy of multitudes, and the rapid progreſs of infidelity, to awaken our fears for the virtue of the riſing generation; but nothing to ſhake our faith, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which ſcripture itſelf does not give us room to expect. The features which compoſe the character of apoſtates, their prophaneneſs, preſumption, lewdneſs, impatience of ſubordination, reſtleſs appetite for change, vain pretenſions to freedom and to emancipate the world, whilſt themſelves are the ſlaves of luſt, the weapons with which they attack Chriſtianity, and the ſnares they ſpread for the unwary, are depicted in the cleareſt colours by the pencil of prophecy. <hi>Knowing this first,</hi> ſays PETER, <hi>that there shall come, in the last days, scoffers, walking after their own lusts</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Peter, iii. v. 3.</note>. In the ſame epiſtle he more fully deſcribes the perſons he alludes to; <hi>as chiefly them that walk after the flesh, in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous are they, self-willed, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities; sporting themselves in their own deceivings, having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:037564_0050_10117204A177BBD8"/>who live in error; while they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Peter, ii.</note>. Of the ſame characters JUDE admoniſhes us, <hi>to remember that they were foretold as mockers, who should be in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts. These be they,</hi> he adds, <hi>who separate themselves</hi> (by apoſtacy) <hi>sensual, not having the spirit.</hi> Infidelity is an evil of ſhort duration. <hi>"It has,"</hi> as a judicious writer obſerves, <hi>"no individual subsistence given it in the system of prophecy. It is not a</hi> BEAST, <hi>but a mere pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid excrescence of the papal beast; an excrescence which, though it may diffuse death through every vein of the body on which it grew, yet shall die along with it</hi>

It is impoſſible that a ſyſtem, which, by vilifying every virtue, and embracing the patronage of almoſt every vice and crime, wages war with all the order and civilization of the world; which, equal to the eſtabliſhment of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, is armed only with the energies of deſtruction, can long retain an aſcendency. It is in no ſhape formed for perpetuity. Sudden in its riſe, and impetuous in its progreſs, it reſembles a mountain torrent, which is loud, filthy and deſolating; but, being fed by no peren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial ſpring, is ſoon drained off and diſappears. By permitting to a certain extent the prevalence of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, Providence is preparing new triumphs for reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. In afferting its authority, the preachers of the goſpel have hitherto found it neceſſary to weigh the proſpects of immortality againſt the intereſts of time, to ſtrip the world of its charms, to inſiſt on the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſs of pleaſure, the unſatisfying nature of rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, the emptineſs of grandeur, and the nothingneſs of
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:037564_0051_1011720624DA0178"/>a mere worldly life. Topics of this nature will always have their uſe; but it is not by ſuch repreſentations alone, that the importance of religion is evinced. The prevalence of impiety has armed us with new weapons in its defence.</p>
            <p>Religion being primarily intended to make men <hi>wise unto salvation,</hi> the ſupport it miniſters to ſocial order, the ſtability it confers on government and laws, is a <hi>subordinate species</hi> of advantage which we ſhould have continued to enjoy without reflecting on its cauſe, but for the developement of deiſtical principles and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment which has been made of their effects in a neighbouring country. It has been the conſtant boaſt of infidels, that their ſyſtem, more liberal and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous than Chriſtianity, needed but to be tried to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an immenſe acceſſion of human happineſs; and Chriſtian nations, careleſs and ſupine, retaining little of religion but the profeſſion, and diſguſted with its reſtraints, lent a favourable ear to theſe pretenſions.

            <p>We might aſk the patrons of infidelity, what fury impels them to attempt the ſubverſion of Chriſtianity? Is it that they have diſcovered a better ſyſtem? To what virtues are their principles favourable, or is there one which Chriſtians have not carried to a higher per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection than any of whom their party can boaſt? Have they diſcovered a more excellent rule of life, or a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hope in death, than that which the ſcriptures ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt? Above all, what are the pretenſions on which they reſt their claims to be the guides of mankind; or which embolden them to expect we ſhould trample upon the experience of ages, and abandon a religion, which has been atteſted by a train of miracles and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, in which millions of our forefathers have found a refuge in every trouble, and conſolation in the hour of death; a religion which has been adorned with the higheſt ſanctity of character and ſplendor of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, which enrols amongſt its diſciples the names of BACON, NEWTON, and LOCKE, the glory of their ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and to which theſe illuſtrious men were proud to dedicate the laſt and beſt fruits of their immortal ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius?</p>
            <p>If the queſtion at iſſue is to be decided by argument, nothing can be added to the triumph of Chriſtianity; if by an appeal to authority, what have our adverſaries to oppoſe to theſe great names? Where are the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels of ſuch pure, uncontaminated morals, unſhaken probity, and extended benevolence, that we ſhould be in danger of being ſeduced into impiety by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample? Into what obſcure receſſes of miſery, into what dungeons, have their Philanthropiſts penetrated, to lighten the fetters and relieve the ſorrows of the help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs captive? What barbarous tribes have their apoſtles
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:037564_0053_10117209405DEAF8"/>viſited, what diſtant climes have <hi>they</hi> explored, encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed with cold, nakedneſs and want, to diffuſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of virtue and the bleſſings of civilization? Or will they rather chuſe to wave their pretenſions to this extraordinary, and in their eyes, eccentric ſpecies of benevolence (for Infidels, we know, are ſworn enemies to enthuſiaſm of every ſort) and reſt their character on their political exploits, on their efforts to reanimate the virtue of a ſinking ſtate, to reſtrain licentiouſneſs, to calm the tumult of popular fury, and by inculcating the ſpirit of juſtice, moderation, and pity for fallen greatneſs, to mitigate the inevitable horrors of revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Our adverſaries will at leaſt have the diſcretion, if not the modeſty, to recede from this teſt.</p>
            <p>More than all, their infatuated eagerneſs, their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricidal zeal to extinguiſh a ſenſe of Deity, muſt excite aſtoniſhment and horror. Is the idea of an Almighty and perfect ruler, unfriendly to any paſſion which is conſiſtent with innocence, or an obſtruction to any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign which it is not ſhameful to avow? Eternal God! on what are thine enemies intent: what are thoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes of guilt and horror, that, for the ſafety of their performers, require to be enveloped in a dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which the eye of Heaven muſt not pierce!—Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable men! proud of being the offspring of chance; in love with univerſal diſorder, whoſe happineſs is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in the belief of there being no witneſs to their deſigns, and who are at eaſe only becauſe they ſuppoſe themſelves inhabitants of a forſaken and fatherleſs world!</p>
            <p>Having been led by the nature of the ſubject to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider chiefly, the manner in which ſceptical impiety af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the welfare of ſtates, it is the more requiſite to warn you againſt that moſt fatal miſtake of regarding religion as an engine of policy; and to recal to your recollection, that the concern we have in it, is much more as <hi>individuals</hi> than as <hi>collective bodies,</hi> and far leſs temporal than eternal. The happineſs it confers
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:037564_0054_1011720DF533CFE0"/>in the preſent life are bleſſings which it ſcatters by the way in its march to immortality. That future condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of being which it aſcertains, and for which its promiſes and truths are meant to prepare us, is the ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate end of human ſocieties, the final ſcope and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of preſent exiſtence, in compariſon of which all the revolutions of nations and all the viciſſitudes of time, are light and tranſitory. <hi>Godliness has,</hi> it is true, <hi>the promise of the life that now is,</hi> but chiefly <hi>of that which is to come.</hi> Other acquiſitions may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to make men great; but, be aſſured, the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of Jeſus is alone ſufficient to make them good and happy. Powerful ſources of conſolation and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, unſhaken fortitude amidſt the changes and pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations of the world, humility remote from meanneſs, and dignity unſtained by pride, contentment in every ſtation, paſſions pure and calm, with habitual ſerenity, full enjoyment of life, undiſturbed by the dread of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, or the fear of an hereafter, are its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable gifts. To theſe enjoyments, however, you will neceſſarily continue ſtrangers, unleſs you reſign yourſelves wholly to its power; for the conſolations of religion are reſerved to reward, to ſweeten and to ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulate to obedience. Many, without renouncing the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, without formally rejecting its diſtinguiſhing doctrines, live in ſuch an habitual vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olation of its laws, and contradiction to its ſpirit, that, conſcious they have more to fear than to hope from its truth, they are never able to contemplate it without terror. It haunts their imagination, inſtead of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillizing their hearts, and hangs with depreſſing weight on all their enjoyments and purſuits. Their religion, inſtead of comforting them under their troubles, is it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf their greateſt trouble, from which they ſeek refuge in the diſſipation and vanity of the world, until the throbs and tumults of conſcience force them back upon religion. Thus ſuſpended betwixt oppoſite powers, the ſport of contradictory influences, they are diſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified for the happineſs of both worlds, and neither en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:037564_0055_1011721103DB7CE0"/>the pleaſures of ſin, nor the peace of piety. Is it ſurpriſing to find a mind thus bewildered in uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and diſſatisfied with itſelf, court deception, and embrace with eagerneſs every pretext to mutilate the claims and enervate the authority of Chriſtianity, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting that it is the very eſſence of the religious prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to preſide and control, and that it is impoſſible to <hi>serve God and Mammon?</hi> It is this claſs of profeſſors, who are chiefly in danger of being entangled in the ſnares of infidelity.</p>
            <p>The champions of infidelity have much more reaſon to be aſhamed, than to boaſt, of ſuch converts. For what can be a ſtronger preſumption of the ſalſehood of a ſyſtem, than that it is the opiate of a reſtleſs conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; that it prevails with minds of a certain deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not becauſe they find it true; but becauſe they feel it neceſſary; and that in adopting it, they conſult leſs with their reaſon, than with their vices and their fears? It requires but little ſagacity to foreſee that ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations which originate in guilt, muſt end in ruin. Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels are not themſelves ſatisfied with the truth of their ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem; for, had they any ſettled aſſurance of its princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, in conſequence of calm diſpaſſionate inveſtigation, they would never diſturb the quiet of the world by their attempts to proſelyte; but would lament their own infelicity, in not being able to perceive ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient evidence for the truth of a religion, which fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes ſuch incentives to virtue, and inſpires ſuch exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hopes. Having nothing to ſubſtitute in the place of religion, it is abſurd to ſuppoſe that, in oppoſition to the collective voice of every country, age, and time, proclaiming its neceſſity, ſolicitude for the welfare of mankind impels them to deſtroy it.</p>
            <p>To very different motives muſt their conduct be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted. More like conſpirators than philoſophers, in ſpice of the darkneſs with which they endeavour to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round themſelves, ſome rays of unwelcome conviction will penetrate, ſome ſecret apprehenſions that all is not
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:037564_0056_10117213E25E7A28"/>right, will make themſelves felt, which they find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo effectual to quell as an attempt to enliſt freſh diſciples, who, in exchange for new principles, impart confidence, and diminiſh fear. For the ſame reaſon it is ſeldom they attack Chriſtianity by argument: their favourite weapons are ridicule, obſcenity and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; as the moſt miſerable outcaſts of ſociety are, of all men, found moſt to delight in vulgar merriment and ſenſeleſs riot.</p>
            <p>JESUS CHRIST ſeems to have <hi>his fan in his hand and to be thoroughly purging his floor;</hi> and nominal Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians will probably be ſcattered like chaff. But has <hi>real</hi> Chriſtianity any thing to fear? Have not the degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate manners, and corrupt lives, of multitudes in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, been, on the contrary, the principal occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſcandal and offence? Infidelity, without intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, is gradually removing this reproach: poſſeſſing the property of attracting to itſelf the morbid humours which pervade the Church, until the Chriſtian profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on the one hand is reduced to a ſound and healthy ſtate, and Scepticiſm on the other, exhibits nothing but a maſs of putridity and diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>In a view of the final iſſue of the conteſt, we ſhould find little cauſe to lament the aſtoniſhing prevalence of Infidelity, but for a ſolicitude for the riſing generation: to whom its principles are recommended by two mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, with young minds the moſt perſuaſive, the love of independence, and the love of pleaſure. With reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to the firſt, we would earneſtly entreat the young to remember, that by the unanimous conſent of all ages, modeſty, docility and reverence to ſuperior years, and to parents, above all, have been conſidered as their <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate virtues,</hi> a guard aſſigned by the immutable laws of God and nature on the inexperience of youth; and with reſpect to the ſecond, that Chriſtianity prohibits no pleaſures that are innocent, lays no reſtraints that are capricious; but that the ſobriety and purity which it enjoins, by ſtrengthning the intellectual powers, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:037564_0057_10117219729BCB98"/>the faculties of mind and body in undiminiſhed vigour, lay <hi>the surest</hi> foundation of preſent peace and future eminence. At ſuch a ſeaſon as this, it becomes an urgent duty on Parents, Guardians and Tutors, to watch, not only over the morals, but the principles of thoſe committed to their care; to make it appear that a concern for their eternal welfare is their chief concern, and to imbue them early with that knowledge of the evidences of Chriſtianity, and that profound reverence for the Scriptures, that with the bleſſing of God, (which with ſubmiſſion they may then expect) <hi>may keep them from this hour of temptation that has come upon all the world, to try them that dwell on the earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To an attentive obſerver of the ſigns of the times, it will appear one of the moſt extraordinary phaenomena of this eventful criſis, that amidſt the ravages of Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm and Infidelity, real Religion is evidently on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe. <hi>The Kingdom of God,</hi> we know, <hi>cometh not with observation;</hi> but ſtill there are not wanting mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt tokens of its approach. The perſonal appearance of the Son of God was announced by the ſhaking of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: his ſpiritual Kingdom, in all probability, will be eſtabliſhed in the midſt of ſimilar convulſions and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. The blaſphemous impiety of the enemies of God, as well as the zealous efforts of his ſincere wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers, will doubtleſs be overruled to accompliſh the purpoſes of his unerring providence: while, in inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the chaſtiſements of offended Deity on corrupt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities and nations, Infidelity marks its progreſs by devaſtation and ruin, by the proſtration of Thrones and concuſſion of Kingdoms; thus apalling the inhabitants of the world, and compelling them to take refuge in the Church of God, the true ſanctuary; the ſtream of divine knowledge unobſerved is flowing in new channels, winding its courſe among humble vallies, refreſhing thirſty deſerts, and enriching, with far other and higher bleſſings than thoſe of commerce, the moſt diſtant climes and nations, until, agreeably to the prediction of prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:037564_0058_1011721AF567FB58"/>the <hi>knowledge of the Lord shall fill and cover the whole earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Within the limits of this diſcourſe, it would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable to exhibit the evidences of Chriſtianity, nor is it my deſign; but there is one conſideration reſulting immediately from my text, which is entitled to great weight with all who believe in the one living and true God, as the ſole object of worſhip. The Epheſians, in common with other Gentiles, are deſcribed in the text as being, previous to their converſion, <hi>without God in the world;</hi> that is, without any juſt and ſolid acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with his character, deſtitute of the knowledge of his will, the inſtitutes of his worſhip, and the hopes of his favour; to the truth of which repreſentation whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver poſſeſſes the ſlighteſt acquaintance with Pagan anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, muſt aſſent; nor is it a fact leſs inconteſtible, that while human philoſophy was never able to aboliſh idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in a ſingle village, the promulgation of the Goſpel overthrew it in a great part (and that the moſt enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened) of the world. If the unity and perfections of God, together with his moral government and excluſive right to the worſhip of mankind, are truths, they cannot reaſonably be denied to be truths of the firſt importance, and infinitely to outweigh the greateſt diſcoveries in ſcience; becauſe they turn the hopes, fears and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts of man into a totally different channel from that in which they muſt otherwiſe flow. Wherever theſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples are firſt admitted, there a new dominion is erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and a new ſyſtem of laws eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>But ſince all events are under divine direction, is it reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that the great Parent, after ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his creatures to continue for ages ignorant of his true character, ſhould, at length, in the courſe of his providence, fix upon falſehood, and that alone, as the effectual method of making himſelf known; and that, what the virtuous exerciſe of reaſon in the beſt and wiſeſt men was never permitted to accompliſh, he ſhould confer on fraud and, deluſion the honour of ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting?
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:037564_0059_1011721C951B1F38"/>It ill comports with the majeſty of truth, or the character of God to believe he has built the nobleſt ſuperſtructure on the weakeſt foundation, or reduced mankind to the miſerable alternative, either of remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſtitute of the knowledge of himſelf, or of deriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it from the polluted ſource of impious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. We therefore feel ourſelves juſtified, on this occaſion, in adopting the triumphant boaſt of the great Apoſtle, <hi>Where is the wise, where is the scribe, where is the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puter of this world? hath not God made foolish the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of this world? for after that, in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.</hi>

               <hi>The fury of the moſt ſanguinary parties was eſpecially pointed againſt the Chriſtian prieſthood,</hi> &amp;c.]—The Author finds he has given great offence to ſome friends whom he highly eſteems, by applying the term <hi>Chriſtian prieſthood</hi> to the popiſh clergy. He begs leave to make a remark or two by way of apology.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is admitted by all candid proteſtants, that ſalvation is attainable in the Roman Catholic church; but he ſhould be glad to be informed what part of the Chriſtian covenant entitles us to expect the ſalvation of thoſe (where the Goſpel is promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated) who are not even a branch of the viſible church of Chriſt. The papiſtical tenets are either <hi>fundamentally</hi> errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous on which ſuppoſition it is certain to papiſt can be ſaved, or their errors muſt be conſiſtent with Chriſtian faith, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently cannot be a valid reaſon for excluding thoſe who maintain them from being a part (a moſt corrupt part, if you pleaſe, but ſtill a part) of the Chriſtian church.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The popiſh clergy were perſecuted under the <hi>character of Chriſtians,</hi> not under the notion of Heretics or Schiſmatics. They, who were the ſubjects of perſecution, were certainly the beſt judges of its aim and direction: and when the Archbiſhop of Paris, and others, endeavoured to ſcreen themſelves from its effects by a recantation, what did they recant? Was it popery? no; but the profeſſion of Chriſtianity. Theſe Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, doubtleſs, meant to remove the ground of offence, which, in their opinion, was the Chriſtian profeſſion. If the ſoundeſt Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtorians have not refuſed the honours of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom to ſuch as ſuffered in the cauſe of truth amongſt the Gnoſtics, it ill becomes the liberality of the preſent age to contemplate, with ſullen indifference, or malicious joy, the ſufferings of conſcientious catholics.</p>
            <p n="3">3. At the period to which the Author refers Chriſtian wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, of <hi>every kind,</hi> was prohibited, while, in ſolemn mockery of religion, adoration was paid to a ſtrumpet, under the title of the goddeſs of reaſon. Is it neceſſary to prove that men, who were thus abandoned, muſt be hoſtile to true religion, under every form? or, if there be any gradations in their abhorrence, to that moſt which is the moſt pure and perfect? Are atheiſm and
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:037564_0061_1011722263BDB820"/>obſcenity more congenial to the proteſtant than to the popiſh profeſſion? To have incurred the hatred of the ruling party of France at the ſeaſon alluded to, is an honour which the author would be ſorry to reſign, as the excluſive boaſt of the church of Rome: to have been the object of the partiality of ſuch bloody and inhuman monſters, would have been a ſtain upon Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants which the virtue of ages could not obliterate.</p>
