            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHEN the firſt parents of mankind had violated the covenant of their God, all their pleaſing proſpects were deſtroyed. Futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to them, was wrapt in impenetrable darkneſs. Conſcious guilt and terrifying expectations filled their minds, while they waited, nor waited long, the awful deciſion of their offended Sovereign.</p>
            <p>IT is not rational to ſuppoſe, that they could even conjecture any ſcheme, which promiſed the leaſt hope of eſcape from the threatened puniſhment
<pb facs="unknown:024747_0004_0FC86845874E1248"/>
to diſobedience. Confuſed with guilt, ſhame and terror, they attempted, but in vain, <hi>to hide from the preſence of the Lord.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>HITHERTO divine goodneſs reigned toward man. Divine mercy, now needed, began to dawn, and thenceforth ſhown brighter and brighter <hi>to the perfect day</hi> of revealed truth. <hi>Then</hi> came goſpel grace to the condemned, through a Redeemer. Then was <hi>firſt</hi> made known the promiſory declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the eternal God, that <hi>the ſeed of the woman ſhould bruiſe the ſerpent's head.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>IF upon the lapſe of man, the Almighty had have forthwith deprived the tranſgreſſors of the light of life, and there have ended for ever the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race, it would have been perfectly juſt. But mercy ſuſpended juſtice; in the diſplay of which, God ſaid to man, Live, <hi>I have found a ranſom.</hi>

               <note n="‖" place="bottom">2 Tim. i.10.</note>
            </p>
            <p>IN this glorious ſcheme of redemption, all the perfections of Deity harmonize. It continues the human race, which without it muſt have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, puts man into a ſalvable ſtate, under a new covenant of grace; according to which, ſin is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly puniſhed, and God can <hi>be juſt, and the juſtifier of the ſinner which believeth in Jeſus.</hi>
               <note n="§" place="bottom">Rom. iii.26.</note>
            </p>

               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:024747_0005_0FC86847C18177B0"/>THIS admirable plan of grace and ſalvation to man, was gradually opened from the firſt promiſe to <hi>the fulneſs of time.</hi> Then Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>the Sun of Righteouſneſs,</hi> the light and life of the world, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe with divine ſplendor, and mightily diſpelled the clouds of ignorance, error and uncertainty which darkened the moral world. In <hi>this</hi> plan, as revealed in the ſcriptures, is contained the will of God to man. According to this, we are to learn what God is, and what we ſhould be. To know and conform to the will of God thus made known, is the firſt duty and higheſt happineſs of man. It is his proper ſtudy, and ſhould be his ſupreme concern.</p>
            <p>LET it be our endeavour, my hearers, to ſearch the will of God to men, not only in thoſe things which <hi>have been,</hi> and <hi>now are,</hi> but <hi>thoſe</hi> alſo which <hi>ſhall be</hi> made plain by accompliſhment. Not indeed with vain curioſity, nor the preſumptuous thought of <hi>ſearching out the Almighty to perfection,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Job xi.7.</note> but, that we may ſee more reaſon, and be more excited to believe and obey, to adore and praiſe with increaſed fervency and firmneſs.</p>
            <p>WITH ſuch views, let us attend to the will of God expreſſed in our text. It is a prophetic diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Iſaiah reſpecting the purity, enlargement and glory of the church of God. In the whole chapter, the prophet evidently looks forward to goſpel times, and ſeems in one paſſage, to extend
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:024747_0006_0FC8684AEFDD9DC8"/>
his views to the permanent bleſſedneſs of the church triumphant. He begins the chapter with great animation. <hi>Ariſe, ſhine, for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is riſen upon thee. For behold, the darkneſs ſhall cover the earth, and groſs darkneſs the people; but the Lord ſhall ariſe upon thee, and his glory ſhall be ſeen upon thee. And the Gentiles ſhall come to thy light, and kings to the brightneſs of thy riſing.</hi> Many more bleſſings of a ſimilar nature are promiſed, and the chapter is cloſed with the words of the text. THY PEOPLE ALSO SHALL BE ALL RIGHTEOUS, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>THE prophet addreſſes himſelf to the Church, or Zion. THY PEOPLE SHALL BE ALL RIGHTEOUS, therefore, may intend, that all the profeſſing peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God ſhall be internally and perſonally righteous; that <hi>every one that nameth the name of Chriſt ſhall depart from iniquity.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Tim. iii.19.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THE expreſſion may extend in its meaning, to the converſion of the Gentiles from dumb idols to the living God, and the ſpread of chriſtianity through the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The former is the moſt probable. In either conſtruction, the increaſe and proſperity of the church are intended. This is to our preſent purpoſe.</p>
            <p>THE people thus <hi>righteous</hi> SHALL INHERIT THE LAND FOR EVER. This may teach us, that the church and all good people are the peculiar choice and care

of God, and ſhall be preſerved. For <hi>them</hi> more eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, the earth is upheld, and made fruitful. For <hi>them,</hi> civil governments are inſtituted and changed, the nations controled, and the world continued. They ſhall poſſeſs, and <hi>eat the good of the land.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>THE BRANCH OF MY PLANTING, THE WORK OF MY HANDS, are expreſſions which evidently, in this place, intend, and apply to the church. Elſewhere, THE BRANCH ſignifies the ſame.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Iſa. iv.2.</note> In other paſſages of ſcripture it has a different meaning. Jeſus Chriſt is frequently intended.<note n="‖" place="bottom">Iſa. xi.1. Jer. xxxiii.15. Zac. iii.8.</note> So by THE WORK OF GOD'S HANDS, we are ſometimes to underſtand his works of creation and providence. But the church, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding religion, is emphatically THE WORK of God. Hence the prophet prays, <hi>Lord, revive thy work.</hi>
               <note n="§" place="bottom">Hab. iii.2.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THE Lord will proſper the church, THAT HE MAY BE GLORIFIED. In and by the church, God is <hi>actively</hi> GLORIFIED. But his care and love mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted toward her, and by all his works of mercy, of juſtice, and of judgment among the nations, he is, and he will be <hi>objectively</hi> GLORIFIED. The divine conduct towards the church, from firſt to laſt, is, and will be vaſtly more for the glory of God, than all his other works and ways reſpecting the children of men.</p>
            <p>A LITTLE ONE SHALL BECOME A THOUSAND, AND A SMALL ONE A STRONG NATION, point us to the

vaſt increaſe of the church, as to number and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from ſmall beginnings. The words may alſo have reſpect to the growth of ſtates and empires, under the ſmiles of Heaven.</p>
            <p>I THE LORD WILL HASTEN IT IN HIS TIME. The Almighty will accompliſh the prophecies and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of his holy word in favor of Zion, and WILL HASTEN IT in the <hi>fitteſt time;</hi> or in Chriſt's time, when the triumphs of his croſs ſhall be ſpread, and <hi>all ſhall bow the knee to Jeſus, and confeſs that He is Lord to the glory of God the Father.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>FROM our text in its connexion, the following comprehenſive doctrine naturally ariſes, viz.</p>
            <p>ALTHOUGH the church hath been ſmall in her beginning, yet the Lord hath encreaſed her, and will do ſo more abundantly, even to greatneſs and glory; and in order to this, he hath, and will cauſe earthly powers and governments to ſubſerve her intereſts.</p>
            <p>TO confirm and illuſtrate this doctrine, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the way for ſome occaſional improvement and practical remarks, I ſhall take a brief view of the <hi>ſmall beginning and progreſs</hi> of the church and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God; of what the Lord <hi>hath done, is doing, hath promiſed,</hi> and, therefore, <hi>will perform</hi> IN HIS TIME, in behalf of his <hi>peculiar people.</hi>

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>LITTLE needs be ſaid to prove, that the church hath been very ſmall in her beginning, and the cauſe of religion in the world apparently weak and neglected. From Adam to the flood, through the ſpace of about ſix hundred years, we find on ſacred record, as leading characters, only Abel, Seth, Enoch and Noah. It is probable, however, that the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity of Seth, who are ſuppoſed to be called <hi>the ſons of God,</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Gen. vi·2.</note> did maintain, for ſome time, the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the true God; untill they formed contracts of marriage with <hi>the daughters of men,</hi> who are alſo ſuppoſed to be the deſcendants of Cain.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Stackhouſe's Compl. Body of Div. p. 312</note> Be this as it may. There was a general corruption of manners immediately preceeding the flood. <hi>All fleſh had corrupted his way.</hi>
               <note n="§" place="bottom">Gen. vi.11.</note> The earth was deluged with wickedneſs before it was with water. <hi>Eight</hi> perſons only were ſaved from the deluge.</p>
            <p>IF we trace the viſible church for hundreds of years farther, even to the twelve Patriarchs, ſtill we find her very ſmall. In Chriſt's time, tho' <hi>many were called,</hi> yet <hi>few</hi> were <hi>choſen.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. xx.16.</note> Centuries after Chriſt, error and wickedneſs prevailed, and <hi>groſs darkneſs covered the people.</hi>

But A LITTLE ONE HATH BECOME A THOUSAND, AND A SMALL ONE A STRONG NATION, both as to the church and the ſtate. THE BRANCH OF GOD's PLANTING hath increaſed, not only in this, but in other countries; not only in our days, but in other periods of the world. Compare the church in Noah's and Abraham's time, with her ſtate and number when Iſrael was delivered from Egyptian bondage, and when the choſen nation flouriſhed in Canaan, and the increaſe appears great.</p>
            <p>IN the reign of king Solomon, <hi>things went well in Judah,</hi> and in all Iſrael. The civil polity of the ſtate, and the religious intereſts of the church were happy and flouriſhing.

            <p>WE will now take a general view of what the Lord <hi>hath done</hi> for his church and the cauſe of religion; by which it will appear, that earthly powers and governments have, and muſt ſubmit to the church, and promote her intereſt.</p>

Hath he not, <hi>with a mighty hand and a ſtretched out arm,</hi> judged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the nations,, humbled the pride of tyrants, wreſted from them the inſtruments of cruelty, and
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:024747_0023_0FC8687E04F00DA8"/>
vindicated the rights of the oppreſſed? In ſeveral inſtances, <hi>a nation hath been born at once,</hi> by poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical regeneration. <note n="(d)" place="bottom">America, France, Poland.</note> Millions of people in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent countries, have been emancipated from the griping hand of deſpotic government, and by happy conſtitutions formed with wiſdom and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation, put in poſſeſſion of glorious liberty. May not all ſee, who religiouſly diſcern the times, that the Lord, by his providence and grace, is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on, as from the morning of time, an inſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, but yet perfectly conſiſtent plan for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, reformation and ſalvation of mankind?</p>
            <p>THE late, mighty revolutions in this and other countries, are fraught with important conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to mankind, and mark diſtinguiſhed eras in the annals of nations. Beyond controverſy, they are the work of God. It is true, they have been attended with temporal evils. Many individuals have ſuffered extremely: but ſtill, thoſe very changes ſo injurious to a few, are favorable to the morals and the happineſs of men in general. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican governments, in their nature, are ever more friendly to virtue and rational enjoyments, than monarchical. A people ſuddenly liberated from a ſtate of abſolute ſubjection to the will of a ſovereign of nobility, are likely to run to the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite extreme of licentiouſneſs; yet, when the adminiſtration of free government takes place with wiſdom and energy, they ſee their duty and intereſt united, and ſoon ſettle in the medium of juſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination and rational obedience.</p>

               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:024747_0024_0FC868849CF4A4B8"/>VAST progreſs is made in the ſcience of civil government. This knowledge is reduced to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in many places, and the happy effects are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed. The genius of the Chriſtian religion is more clearly perceived; ſuperſtition and bigotry are more done away; and we hope in God for a brighter exhibition of the goſpel in practice.</p>
            <p>IN America and Europe, the civil and religious "rights of man" are better underſtood, and more fully enjoyed, than in former periods: Hence, the ſpirit of civil and religious liberty prevails, except in a few places. The nations of chiſtendom, and different denominations of chriſtians, are more than ever convinced, that <hi>the kingdom of God,</hi> among men, <hi>is not meat and drink;</hi> that it conſiſteth not in external forms, human creeds, articles of faith and modes of worſhip, but <hi>in righteouſneſs and peace and joy in the Holy Ghoſt</hi>;<note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. xiv.17.</note>—that it is not ſaying, <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> but <hi>doing the will of God,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Ver. 18.</note> that conſtitutes the good man. <hi>He that in theſe things ſerveth Chriſt, is acceptable to God, and approved of men.</hi>

            <p>OUR federal and ſtate governments are propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to religion. It is, however, wiſhed by ſome, that for the good of ſociety, if from no other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, the viſible obſervance of the ſabbath, and the public worſhip of God, were more ſtrictly enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the civil arm.</p>
            <p>MEN of liberality in ſentiments are of the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that ſuch an exerciſe of civil power would be
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:024747_0025_0FC86885C9FCB3A0"/>
very beneficial to the community, and perfectly compatible with the principles of a free govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>OUR rulers, in general, are men of religion, as well as men of wiſdom. At the head of the Union ſits our beloved and admired PRESIDENT, the friend of mankind, the glory of his country, and the ornament of human nature. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletes the unrivalled character by adding that of a chriſtian. From his exalted ſtation, he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends religion with peculiar advantage, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forces it by an example as great as it is ſingular, and as illuſtrious as it is rare. Long may he live a bleſſing to his people. Eternally may he wear a crown of glory.</p>
            <p>IN the churches of our Lord in America, peace and harmony are generally enjoyed among bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and between miniſters and people. <hi>Our young men are raiſed up for prophets, and the ſons of the church for nazarites</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Amos ii.2.</note> to God. Schools and Colleges are encouraged; uſeful knowledge is promoted and happily diffuſed through the great body of the people. In a word, ſuch is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, harmonious, and, on the whole, growing condition of the church in this land; ſuch are the ſtrides of liberty and free inquiry in this and foreign lands; ſuch the diminution of Papal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence and bigotted zeal where they have long ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannized, that we have reaſon to hope, that the promiſed period is not far diſtant, when, under the

            <p>IF there be any thing in nature, beyond the reach of our bodily ſenſes, on which we may ſafely depend, ſurely it is the <hi>truth</hi> of divine reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. Nothing of the kind, could have been better proved than the ſcriptures. Every paſſage

            <p>ANOTHER prophecy of Iſaiah to the ſame point, is worthy of notice. Speaking of the happy ſtate of the kingdom of Chriſt, he ſaith, <hi>The wolf alſo ſhall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard ſhall lie down with the kid: the calf, and the young lion, and the fatling together, and a little child ſhall lead them. And the cow and the bear ſhall feed, their young ones ſhall lie down together; and the lion ſhall eat ſtraw like the ox. And the ſucking child ſhall play on the hole of the aſp, and the weaned child ſhall put his hand on the cockatrice—den.

               <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſa. cxxii.1, 2.</note> We may add, into a houſe far more convenient and elegant, than we have hitherto enjoyed.

            <p>TO aid our meditations, on this occaſion, and excite us more religiouſly to <hi>regard the operation of the Divine hand,</hi> and the times that paſs over us, I ſhall take a brief, hiſtorical view of the town and church, as far as records and my knowledge of facts will permit.</p>
            <p>THIS TOWN was incorporated as a plantation, at <hi>Muſquetequid,</hi> 
               <note n="(g)" place="bottom">The original Indian name.</note> by the name of CONCORD, by an act of the General Court of the then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, held at <hi>Newtown,</hi> September 3d, 1635. <note n="(h)" place="bottom">This is made certain by the records in the Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's office of this Commonwealth.</note>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:024747_0032_0FC86899B5D6C6A0"/>
The town was fairly purchaſed of the natives, and payment duly made to their ſatisfaction. The tract of land firſt purchaſed, was <hi>ſix miles ſquare;</hi> the centre being very near the ſpot where the Meeting-houſe now ſtands. <note n="(i)" place="bottom">
                  <p>The purchaſe, payment, extent, &amp;c. of the town, are certified by the depoſitions of two white men, viz. William Butterick and Richard Rice, and two chriſtian Indians, viz. Jehojakin and Jethro. They unitedly teſtify and ſay, "That they were preſent at the making the bargain for the town of Concord.—That at the houſe of Mr Peter Bulkeley. (the Rev. <hi>P.</hi> Bulkeley) Mr. Simon Willard, Mr. John Jones, Mr. Spencer and others, did purchaſe of Squaw Sachem, Tahattawau and Nimrod, a tract of land ſix miles ſquare, the centre being the place (or near) where the bargain was made.—That ſaid Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lard and others did pay for ſaid land in wampam peage, hatchets, hoes, knives, cotton cloth and chintz, to the ſaid Indians.—And, that Wappacowet, huſband to Squaw Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem, received a ſuit of cotton cloth, a hat, a white, linen band, ſhoes, ſtocking and a great coat, on account of ſaid bargain.—That in the concluſion, the Indians decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that they were ſatisfied, and that the Engliſh were welcome."</p>
                  <p>The above depoſitions were taken by authority, before Thomas Danforth, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of Cambridge, and are recorded in the town-book of Concord, in lieu of the firſt town records which were <hi>burnt.</hi>
                  </p>
               </note> Additions were afterward made by grant and purchaſe.</p>
            <p>IT appears, that the firſt ſettlers of the town, were very careful to have a juſt and fair title to the ſoil. They were not only juſt, but generous. Charity obliges us to believe, that they <hi>feared God and regarded man,</hi> and exemplified to the Savages the religion of Jeſus; the love of which induced
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:024747_0033_0FC868A3357EA808"/>

            <p>THE Rev'd. <hi>William Emerſon</hi> was ordained, January 1ſt, 1766.

He left his beloved flock, and endeared family, to join the army, at Ticonderoga, Auguſt 16th, 1776. He fell a prey to dire diſeaſe, October following, at Rutland, Otter-Creek. Could he have died in the preſence of his family and friends; or could the kind hand of a partner, a child, a parent have adminiſtered cordials, in <hi>that</hi> ſolitude, it had been ſome conſolation, and even the diſtreſſes of a dying bed had been mitigated. But I forbear. Infinite wiſdom directed otherwiſe. His covenant God did not forſake him. We have plenary evidence, that he died in ſtrong faith for himſelf and his family, and like a chriſtian hero. We doubt not, he is a conqueror through Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>UNDER his miniſtry, almoſt eleven years, ſixty-ſix perſons were admitted to full communion, and five hundred and ſix baptized.

Of the unworthineſs of the preſent paſtor, to fill <hi>a golden candleſtick</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, and the ſmall ſucceſs in his work, it is more ſuitable for him to be deeply ſenſible, than to give a deſcription.</p>

            <p>A FEW practical remarks ſhall cloſe this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi> IN all the concerns and increaſe of the church, God ſhould be acknowledged and praiſed. This is peculiarly the duty of a people profeſſing godlineſs, and embracing chriſtianity. As <hi>in all our ways,</hi> ſo eſpecially in religious concernments, we ſhould <hi>acknowledge God, aſk wiſdom of him,</hi> and be ever ready to ſay, <hi>Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy Name give glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truths ſake.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="unknown:024747_0045_0FC868C8F8ED9FA8"/>SINCE the canon of ſcripture hath been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated, ſuch viſible manifeſtations of Deity are not to be expected, as were frequent under the Theocracy of the Jewiſh nation; yet the Lord is not the leſs preſent with his people, and hath not the leſs love to his church. Her ſupport and increaſe ever have been, and ever will be of the power and grace of God. <hi>For his own Name ſake,</hi> he will preſerve and proſper Zion. Collectively and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividually, ſhe is dear to him <hi>as the apple of his eye.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. xvii.8.</note> The Lord Jeſus Chriſt <hi>is head over all things to the church;</hi> and hath <hi>all power given unto him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both in heaven and in earth.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> IT is the obvious duty of all to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, and co-operate with every revival of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Every commotion among people, with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions to religion, is not a genuine concern to know and obey the Lord. <hi>Every ſpirit is not of God.</hi> We are, therefore, directed to <hi>try the ſpirits, whether they are of God.</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">1 Joh. iv.1, 2, 3.</note> But there are times, when the Spirit of God is ſent down in more plentiful ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions; when <hi>the Lord cometh and raineth down righteouſneſs. Then</hi> the minds of men are more ſuſceptible of divine impreſſions, and opened to receive the truth. For ſuch times the godly pray, as did the prophet, <hi>O Lord revive thy work.</hi> When ſuch ſeaſons do come, and people are inquiring the way to heaven, the miniſters of the goſpel ſhould be very attentive to diſcern, and faithful to

improve the favourable opportunity for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of ſinners, and the comfort and confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of believers. Thoſe who are <hi>men</hi> in Chriſt alſo, tho' not teachers, ſhould gently lead <hi>babes</hi> to <hi>the ſincere milk of the word, that they may grow thereby.</hi> All ſhould welcome and join ſuch influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as diſpoſes ſinners to inquire <hi>what they ſhall do to be ſaved,</hi> and <hi>the wicked to forſake his way.</hi> All ſhould be very careful not to <hi>break the bruiſed reed, nor quench the ſmoking flax.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly.</hi> I SHALL here be permitted, I truſt, a very natural remark which reſpects the miniſters of Chriſt. It ariſes, my fathers and brethren, from our office; and is contained in the words of the apoſtle: <hi>We then are workers together with God.</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Cor. vi.1.</note> We are commiſſioned and ſent forth for the expreſs purpoſe of promoting the intereſts of religion, the increaſe of the church, and the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of precious ſouls. We are engaged in the ſame glorious cauſe of <hi>peace on earth and good will to men,</hi> leading to heavenly glory, with the God of all grace, the Savior of ſinners, and the Spirit of truth. Men never were employed in a better cauſe than <hi>that</hi> which we plead. It muſt be pleaſant to a benevolent mind, to proclaim pardon to the guilty, ſalvation to the wretched, and to <hi>beſeech</hi> ſinners <hi>to be reconciled to God.</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">2 Cor. v.20.</note> Can we be indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent? Shall we not exert ourſelves? Yes; through Chriſt ſtrengthening us, we will <hi>take heed to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to our doctrine.</hi> We will carry the church, and the ſouls of our people, in the arms
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:024747_0047_0FC868CC0807A230"/>
of our affection and prayer, to the throne of grace. We will pray ſo fervently, preach ſo faithfully, and live ſo piouſly, as to <hi>ſave both our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and them that hear us.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Tim. iv.16.</note> To encourage us, we may call to mind what our Lord ſaid to his firſt miniſters; <hi>Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Mat. xxviii.20.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly.</hi> IN the darkeſt times, as to religion, there is ground for faith and hope. God is in the church, and is engaged to defend and proſper her. IN HIS TIME HE WILL HASTEN IT. The <hi>burning buſh</hi> which Moſes ſaw in <hi>Horeb,</hi> juſtly repreſents the church. <hi>The buſh burned; but was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed.

               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Ex. iii.2, 4.</note> So he is in the midſt of the church, in all her afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and trials, and will never ſuffer her to be <hi>conſumed. The Lord hath comforted his people, and will have mercy upon his afflicted.</hi> The moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious works of God, before the children of men, have been in behalf of the church. Our diſcourſe has been chiefly to this point.</p>
            <p>SHOULD <hi>mothers</hi> prove monſters, and <hi>forget</hi> to nouriſh their tender babes, <hi>yet, ſaith the Lord, will I not forget thee. Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands, thy walls are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally before me.</hi>
               <note n="§" place="bottom">Iſa. xlix.15, 16.</note> With ſuch precious promiſes of ſuch an Almighty Friend, the church may <hi>rejoice in hope,</hi> amidſt the moſt gloomy appearances.</p>

               <hi>Fifthly.</hi> WE remark, the unavailing power of the enemies of the church, and of religion. To ſuch enemies we may ſay, <hi>Perceive ye how ye pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail nothing?</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Joh. xii.19.</note> Were they duly to read the holy ſcriptures, and conſider the divine procedure, they would tremble at the thought of being enemies to religion, and the people of God. Every moment they are expoſed to the inſupportable wrath of an infinite and angry God, whoſe government, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and church they oppoſe. They who ſet themſelves againſt the honor of God, the peace, happineſs and ſalvation of men, may be certain, that, in ſuch a mind, they <hi>ſhall periſh, and be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly waſted. To the Lord belongeth vengeance and recompence; their foot ſhall ſlide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that ſhall come upon them make haſte.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Deut. xxxii.35.</note> It is <hi>the madneſs of folly</hi> to oppoſe <hi>that</hi> cauſe which the infinite God is engaged to promote, even to the utter deſtruction of its enemies.</p>
            <p>THE church may ſay, as Eliſha ſaid to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, when a hoſt compaſſed the city to deſtroy him. <hi>Fear not; for they that be with us are more than they that be with them.</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">2 Kings vi.16.</note>
            </p>
            <p>IT has been ſhown abundantly, that no wiſdom, nor might, nor dignity of man, can prevail againſt God. <hi>If God be for us, who can be againſt us?</hi> 
               <note n="§" place="bottom">Rom. viii.31.</note> Conſider theſe things, ye who forget God, who
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:024747_0049_0FC868D38642D820"/>
ſubmit not to his government, who deſpiſe the church, who make light of Chriſt, and practiſe not his holy religion. Collect your thoughts, and ſee, <hi>who hath hardened himſelf againſt God, and hath proſpered?</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Job ix.4.</note>
            </p>
            <p>ONCE more. Our duty, intereſt and happineſs, all urge us to join the cauſe of God and religion, of Chriſt and the church. This is obvious thro' the whole diſcourſe. Let all who hear me, be perſuaded to this. Let every one <hi>bow the knee to Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and regulate their faith and practice by his heavenly doctrines and example. My hearers, <hi>it is not a vain thing for you; becauſe it is your life.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Deut. xxxii.47.</note> 
               <hi>Chooſe this day whom you will ſerve;</hi> and henceforth, may we all be the true diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Jeſus Chriſt, and qualified to join the church triumphant in endleſs glory.</p>
            <p>WITH overcoming faith, lively hope and ardent prayer, let chriſtians look forward to the future peace, purity and glory of the church, predicted and promiſed in the holy ſcriptures. The proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect is calculated to animate you in duty, and to comfort you under ſorrows. I have a diſpoſition to dwell upon this thought; but, perhaps, I have already been too lengthy.</p>
            <p>I WILL cloſe, therefore, with the prophetic words of the Pſalmiſt, ultimately expreſſive of future, ſpiritual bleſſings to the goſpel church and children of God. <hi>They ſhall fear thee, as long

as the ſun and moon endure, throughout all genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. He ſhall come down like rain upon the mown graſs; as ſhowers that water the earth. In his days ſhall the righteous flouriſh: and abundance of peace, ſo long as the moon endureth. He ſhall have domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion from ſea to ſea, and from the river to the ends of the earth: they that dwell in the wilderneſs ſhall bow before him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and his enemies ſhall lick the duſt. His name ſhall endure for ever; men ſhall be bleſſed in him, and all nations ſhall call him bleſſed.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſalm lxxii.</note> Let us all join in the praiſe, while we add, <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God, the God of Iſrael, who only doth won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous things. And bleſſed be his glorious name for ever; and let the whole earth be filled with his glory.</hi> AMEN AND AMEN.<note n="†" place="bottom">ibid.</note>
