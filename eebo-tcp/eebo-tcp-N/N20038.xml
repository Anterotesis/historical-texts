            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>Then the five men departed and came to Laiſh, and ſaw the people that were therein, how they dwelt careleſs, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and ſecure; and there was no magiſtrate in the land, that might put them to ſhame in any thing; and they were far from the Zidonians, and had no buſineſs with any man.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>ALL Scripture is written for our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. It is intended not only to reveal to us the purpoſes of God's mercy and the requiſitions of his will, but to furniſh our minds with the wiſdom which is profitable to direct us in the various ſituations to which by Providence we are called. The hiſtory of the Bible contains a lively picture of human life and manners. It paints the various feelings which agitate the heart of man at different periods. It deſcribes the manner in which individuals and bodies of men have
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:026249_0004_0FCFAC03D3149908"/>
conducted in different circumſtances. It points out the motives of their conduct, and the conſequences which reſulted from it. And thus the word of GOD furniſhes us with maxims of wiſdom, and leſſons of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, without our paying the dear price at which they are ſometimes purchaſed. From this hiſtory we find that mankind have been much the ſame in all ages; that the ſame paſſions and principles have actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated them all; and that the ſame effects have gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally reſulted from the ſame cauſes.</p>
            <p>MODERN philoſophers are ready to ſuppoſe that they have made great improvements in the knowledge of mankind, and in the various ſyſtems by which hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man governments may be formed and ſupported with the moſt happy ſucceſs. But if we read the hiſtory of the Bible, we ſhall be ready to conclude with Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omon, "The thing that hath been, it is that which ſhall be; and that which is done is that which ſhall be done; and there is no new thing under the ſun." In this hiſtory we ſhall find the ſame general princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples laid down which are now conſidered as the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis of free and happy ſtates, and the ſame methods preſcribed to preſerve and increaſe them when they are formed. It is difficult to find any ſituation now to which there cannot be found ſome parallel in the ſacred volume.</p>
            <p>THE maxim, "that it is neceſſary in peace to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for war," is now adopted by every human gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment. Founded in reaſon and good ſenſe, this maxim will be queſtioned by no one who does not doubt the lawfulneſs of war in all caſes. Experience decides poſitively upon its truth, and the conduct of mankind proves their conviction of its expediency.
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:026249_0005_0FCFABFFE995FB18"/>
And a ſtriking example of the truth of this maxim is given us by the words of the text. The men of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh were careleſs and ſecure; they had no order nor government; they conſidered themſelves as at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from any enemy, and in no danger of an inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and theſe very cauſes operated to incite the Danites to invade them, and rendered their conqueſt eaſy and certain.</p>

               </note> "afterwards called Caeſarea Philippi, was placed in a very pleaſant ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the rivers Jor and Dan, almoſt at the foot of mount Libanus. This town was the extreme bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Judea to the north, as Beerſheba was to the ſouth. The inhabitants dwelt after the manner of the Zidonians. The city of Zidon was nearly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by the ſea; it was ſtrongly fortified, and thus its citizens felt perfectly ſecure. The Zidonians were a very powerful people, and had little to dread from any of the nations around them. This occaſioned them to feel perfectly at eaſe; and the men of Laiſh, who were probably a colony from Zidon, catched the manners of the parent ſtate, and without the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon felt the ſame ſecurity. They were diſtant a day's journey from Zidon, which was ſufficient to prevent them from receiving thence immediate aſſiſtance and ſupport, in an attack ſuddenly commenced and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed. When the hiſtory ſays that they had no buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with any man, it probably means that they did not carry on trade and commerce with any people, and lived entirely by themſelves; or elſe, that they had ſo little care of their ſafety, and ſo high an opinion of their own abilities, as to form no league or alliance with any other people"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:026249_0006_0FCF8C02E4F99B50"/>THE hiſtory to which the text relates is briefly this: The tribe of Dan had not conquered the whole por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of land aſſigned to them in Canaan; and being ſtraitened for room, they determined, by a vigorous exertion, to procure to themſelves the accommodation which they needed. They acted prudently and wiſely in the proſecution of this deſign; for, they did not at once commence an emigration without having any certain object before them, but detached a ſmall party to find out a place adapted to their views, and a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that could be eaſily conquered. Laiſh preſented itſelf to them as calculated to anſwer both theſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. The motives which induced the children of Dan to attack the place, and the reaſons which made the conqueſt ſo eaſy, are briefly recounted in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the ſpies:—"Ariſe, that ye may go up againſt them; for we have ſeen the land, and behold it is very good: And are ye ſtill? Be not ſlothful to go and to enter to poſſeſs the land. When ye go, ye ſhall come unto a people ſecure, and to a large land; for GOD hath given it into your hands—a place where there is no want of any thing that is in the earth." The fertility of the ſoil, and the pleaſantneſs of the ſituation, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated their wiſhes to poſſeſs the land. The perfect ſecurity in which the people dwelt, and their total un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preparedneſs to defend themſelves, calmed their fears of any formidable reſiſtance. They came, they ſaw, they conquered. And the people of Laiſh fell, a mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancholy proof of the danger of ſecurity, and a ſtriking demonſtration of the neceſſity of preparing againſt violence and invaſion, even in a time of the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found peace, and at the greateſt diſtance from any enemy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:026249_0007_0FCFABFE50E276C8"/>THIS leſſon, ſo ſtrikingly delineated in the hiſtory before us, is the leſſon of the day. We are now met in the houſe of GOD to aſſiſt the devotions of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and reſpectable military Corps, founded by our anceſtors, to guard againſt the very error which proved fatal to the exiſtence and independence of Laiſh. This Corps was intended as a nurſery for the officers who ſhould command the militia of the colony, and who might thus train them up to "fight for their brethren, their ſons and their daughters, their wives and their houſes." Deeply as theſe good men were impreſſed with the peaceful religion of JESUS CHRIST, they ſtill believed the lawfulneſs and neceſſity of defending the liberty and property which GOD had given them. Brave and hardy, like the wilderneſs which they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, they could not endure the idea of yielding their independence even to the boldeſt invader; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by vigilance and exertion, by order and diſcipline, they guarded againſt the danger, or prepared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to repel it. They founded therefore this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, in which the principal men among them cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully enrolled themſelves, and where the man who had commanded armies did not feel his honor injured, or his dignity impaired, by being commanded in his turn.</p>
            <p>THE occaſion therefore, and the ſentiment of the text, lead me,</p>
            <p>IN the firſt place, to remark upon the folly which a people diſcover, and the danger to which they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves, when they live in a ſtate of ſecurity, unprepared to reſiſt an invaſion, or defend themſelves againſt the attacks of an enemy.</p>
            <p>BUT how are we to defend ourſelves when our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is invaded, and we are threatened with the loſs of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:026249_0008_0FCFABFCD5901C70"/>
every thing we hold dear, by the violence and fury of an enemy? By declaring, with the honeſt Quaker, that we will not reſiſt any force which may come againſt us, becauſe our holy religion forbids us to fight? By long and learned and critical orations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the injuſtice and cruelty of invaſion, and its incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency with the rights of man? Shall we ſend the miniſters of religion to meet an army of invaders, and to tell them that they are not doing as they would be done by; that they act inconſiſtently with the religion of CHRIST, and that GOD will puniſh them for their injuſtice? Or, ſhall we ſpread out our ſupplicating hands to them, and beg them not to ſhed brethren's blood, nor deprive us of the liberty, the property and independence which GOD has beſtowed upon us, and which we deſire to tranſmit to our children?</p>
            <p>WERE all mankind actuated by the peaceful relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of JESUS CHRIST (as they will be at ſome future period) then theſe methods would be effectual; but under the preſent circumſtances of human nature they would be the ſubject only of deriſion. So deeply is the human heart depraved, ſo ſtrongly do ferocious paſſions operate upon mankind, as that the ſtill ſmall voice of reaſon and religion cannot be heard. The loud calls of ambition and avarice drown their feeble whiſpers, and a torrent of violence and oppreſſion ſweep away their warmeſt advocates.</p>
            <p>IN theſe circumſtances, our only method is to reſiſt force with force, to repreſs the violence which we do not provoke, and to let men know that we will defend with our lives the liberty and the happineſs which GOD has given us.</p>
            <p>BUT it is ſtrange, ſome will obſerve, that doctrines of this nature ſhould be preached by a miniſter of
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:026249_0009_0FCFABF9B282B9A0"/>
peace, who profeſſes a religion which breathe the warmeſt benevolence, and teaches mankind to live and love as brethren! Our maſter, will they ſay, "came not to deſtroy men's lives, but to ſave them;" he ſtrictly prohibits every degree of wrath and envy, and enjoins us to follow peace with all men."</p>
            <p>THE lawfulneſs of defenſive war has been ſo often proved from this place, upon theſe occaſions, as that many obſervations upon the ſubject will be needleſs. We muſt take mankind as they are, becauſe they will not be what they ought. We know that there are men, and many men, who are totally deſtitute of moral principle, and care not whom they wound or deſtroy, if they can enrich and aggrandize themſelves. We know that there are nations who wiſh to aſſume univerſal authority, and ſubjugate their neighbours to their will. Can any man, in the exerciſe of common ſenſe and reaſon, ſuppoſe that the Goſpel prohibits us to reſiſt ſuch violence? Am I obliged to deliver my purſe to an highwayman, or my life to a murderer, when I am able to defend myſelf? Does the religion of CHRIST enjoin its votaries to ſubmit to the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the firſt ruffian nation which will attack them; to give up their liberty, and the liberty of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to thoſe who would make them "hewers of wood and drawers of water?" If my brother, agitated with a delirium, attempts to injure me, or take away my life, am I to yield myſelf a quiet victim to his diſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Theſe queſtions carry their own anſwer with them, and muſt ſtrike conviction to every unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced mind; for to act in this manner will be to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent our throats to the butcher, and to court our own deſtruction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:026249_0010_0FCFABF7800FC710"/>WARS undertaken to gratify the luſt of power, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences excited by thoſe "luſts from whence come wars and fightings among men," are decidedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the law of GOD. Every good man mourns over thoſe fatal contentions where kindred blood is ſhed; and where brethren of the ſame family, children of the ſame father "bite and devour one another." But where a people contend not for glory or conqueſt; where they take every method to avoid an alternative ſo diſagreeable; yet where they cannot preſerve their lives, their liberties, their eſtates and their religion, without "reſiſting unto blood," they are to do ſo. If they do it not, they offend againſt GOD, and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily ſacrifice the birthright which he has given them. GOD of old commanded his people to reſiſt ſuch at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, and to make war upon thoſe who attacked them; and would he have done this had war been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful in all caſes, and directly contrary to the nature and reaſon of things? I am aware that he permitted many things under former diſpenſations "becauſe of the hardneſs of men's hearts," becauſe the ſtate of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature would not permit them to be different; but then he never expreſsly <hi>enjoined</hi> men to do what was morally wrong? War he has enjoined; and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roz was curſed by divine command, becauſe they "came not to the help of the LORD, to the help of the LORD againſt the mighty."</p>
            <p>IF it is lawful thus to defend ourſelves, and if we have reaſon to expect the divine protection and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port only in the uſe of proper means, then it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly wrong to neglect theſe means, and to live in a ſtate of ſupineneſs and ſecurity; becauſe diſcipline and military knowledge are abſolutely neceſſary to ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful war; and ſuch diſcipline cannot be attained at
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:026249_0011_0FCFABF30EE41688"/>
once. All knowledge is progreſſive, and military ſkill is to be acquired in the ſame way, by the ſame exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and perſeverance which make us eminent in any other ſcience. True it is, that native bravery and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent enthuſiaſm will do much to animate men to he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roic deeds in defence of their country; but with how much greater advantage do theſe principles operate, when they are tempered with diſcretion, and guided by experience! The firſt is the courage of a maſtiff, who ſhuts his eyes, and runs into the very jaws of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, but who ſometimes bears all before him; the ſecond is the fortitude of a man, who knows the nature of his object, and the means by which it may be accompliſhed. A nation free and brave cannot be conquered; but its defence muſt coſt more dearly, and its diſtreſſes muſt be greatly protracted, if its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are not acquainted with the art of war. Abſurd and fooliſh then it is, for any people to live in ſecurity, to flatter themſelves that their tranquillity ſhall not be interrupted, and to remain ignorant of military diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline! They act unwiſely when they do not learn the art of defending themſelves, until that defence is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately neceſſary; and when they truſt to their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's beating them into ſkill, and inſtructing them to be ſoldiers, as the "men of Succoth were taught with briers and thorns."</p>
            <p>IT is certainly unwiſe, again, for a people to live in ſecurity, without preparing againſt invaſion until that invaſion takes place, becauſe exertions for defence ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly made will not be ſo effectual, nor anſwer the ſame purpoſe with thoſe which are made coolly and with time. If fortreſſes are ſuddenly erected, they will want ſtrength and firmneſs. If an army is raiſed, and they are called to fight before they have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:026249_0012_0FCFABF194B4DB88"/>
in the firſt rudiments of war, they will proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be defeated. Haſte is no friend to wiſe counſels or to effectual defence. The ſpur of the occaſion may animate to vigorous exertions for a ſhort time, and deſpair may lead a rude and undiſciplined multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to do wonderful things; but their violence will ſoon put them out of breath, and a cool and wary en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emy will be able gradually to defeat and diſperſe them. In theſe caſes, as in all others, ſkill and knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge will make hard things eaſy, and will ſave much labour and pains. By a wiſe and judicious mode of defence, not haſtily adopted, but carefully adjuſted in all its various parts, much damage may be prevented, and many valuable lives may be ſaved. What wiſe people then will neglect, even in the boſom of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, to guard againſt every ſurpriſe, and prepare themſelves to reſiſt the firſt bold intruder who may attack them!</p>
            <p>NO people can have any ground for ſecurity while they are deſtitute of the means of defence. They lie open to every danger, and are liable to be inſulted, abuſed and conquered, by any nation which may think them worthy of their attention. Such a ſtate ought to excite alarm, and no people ſhould be eaſy while they are expoſed to danger ſo imminent. But their liſtleſſneſs, like that of a man in a lethargy, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly increaſes with their diſeaſe, and generally ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates in the death of their liberty.</p>
            <p>BUT, preparations made in peace, and an ability to reſiſt invaſion are, thirdly, the moſt effectual means to prevent it. Their neighbours will eſteem it madneſs and folly to expoſe themſelves to ſuch a formidable reſiſtance; and a people thus prepared and diſciplined
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:026249_0013_0FCFABF01800BAC8"/>
will be an object, not only of veneration, but of fear. Marauders, tyrants who wiſh to carry their deſpotiſm into foreign countries, or to fatten on their ſpoils, will not chooſe for their objects thoſe hardy and ſkilful nations, who ſtand ready to defend themſelves and their country. Such men will look, as did the tribe of Dan, for ſome people who dwell quiet and ſecure, without vigilance, without diſcipline or the means of reſiſtance. Such a people court invaſion, they invite an attack, and beckon to thoſe who delight in ſpoil to "come and take away their place and nation." Wary and prudent commanders will confider long before they attack a fortreſs ſtrongly fortified and well gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſoned; and they will count the coſt before they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade a country whoſe inhabitants are all trained to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, and "know how to uſe the ſword and the bow." But the weakneſs of a fortreſs, the ignorance or ſecurity of a people, mark them as proper ſubjects to be attacked and conquered.</p>
            <p>RESPECTABILITY always attends the vigilance and diſcipline which I am recommending. It is a proof of wiſdom to look forward and prepare for futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to guard againſt any danger which may ariſe, and to provide remedies for every diſaſter which may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen. Such conduct is a proof of a healthy and vig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orous ſtate; it diſcovers energy in council, and an elaſtic well braced government. This people will ſtand high in the eſtimation of the world. Their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance will be courted, and this will give them new ſtrength and new defences. The ſaying of our Lord, alluding however to a more important circumſtance, will in this caſe be fully accompliſhed—"Unto him that hath ſhall be given, and he ſhall have abundance, but from him that hath not ſhall be taken even that which he ſeemeth to have."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:026249_0014_0FCF8BFFE7EE3AA0"/>THE hiſtory of mankind will furniſh us with num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs inſtances wherein the truth of theſe obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions has been exemplified. Scarcely a page of this hiſtory can be opened which does not contain full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of it. But we need not go from our own age or our own times to find this conviction. The people of America have proved it to the world, and have reaped the happy conſequences of vigilance and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, as well as of perſonal bravery. At the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of our late controverſy with one of the moſt formidable nations upon earth, we had not the means of defence which other nations enjoy. We were without ammunition, without money, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out allies; but we had an hardy yeomanry, zealous in the cauſe of liberty, and verſed from their infancy in the uſe of arms. Every man had been more or leſs trained and diſciplined; and we had a general ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with military ſcience. We proved the benefit of this preparation, when we met the embat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled legions of Britain, and ſpread terror through hoſts commanded by their ableſt Generals. The heights of Charleſtown witneſſed the bravery of our citizens, and furniſhed a convincing evidence of the wiſdom of thoſe inſtitutions which made the people of New England ſoldiers from their cradle. Superior as were our foes in equipments, "in all the pomp and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of war," yet ſtill they paid ſo dearly for their victory as that the acquiſition of one or two more ſuch victories would have ruined them.</p>
            <p>AND how deplorable would have been our ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, had we not been thus inſtructed and prepared for defence! Attacked by an enemy who claimed a right to "bind us in all caſes whatſoever," and whoſe high toned ſpirits were exaſperated at the idea of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:026249_0015_0FCFABEE86D0A4E8"/>
we muſt have fallen a prey to their violence, and bidden an everlaſting farewell to liberty and its bleſſings. Taſkmaſters, worſe than Egyptian, would have been ſet over us, and our children muſt have toil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſupport the luxury of their oppreſſors.</p>
            <p>BUT when reſiſtance had taken place, and we had declared ourſelves independent, what miſeries, what exquiſite diſtreſſes would have been the probable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of our ſubjugation! An incenſed ſoldiery would have given way to their unhallowed luſts, and diſregarded the laws of GOD and man to gratify their cravings! Alas!—what ſound is this which pierces my heart? It is the ſhrieks of a tender wife, wreſted from the arms of a beloved huſband, to gratify the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite of a lordly maſter!—But whence are thoſe ſoft complainings, thoſe deep drawn ſighs? They are the lamentations of injured innocence, of violated virtue, of the defiled virgin, who has fallen a victim to brutal force!—But why does buſy imagination tranſport me to a ſcene ſtill more painful? Why does it hurry me to the field of blood, the place of execution for the friends of American liberty? Whom does it there call me to ſee led to the ſcaffold with the dignity of Cato, the fortitude of Brutus, and the gentleneſs of Cicero marked deeply on his countenance? It is the gallant WASHINGTON, deſerted by his countrymen, and ſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rificed becauſe he fought in their defence!—Of whom conſiſts yonder group of heroes? It is an HANCOCK, an ADAMS one and the other, a FRANKLIN, a RUT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEDGE!—but I repreſs the burſting ſentiment—the bare imagination bows my ſoul with unutterable grief!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:026249_0016_0FCFABE9778B6BE0"/>THANKS to the GOD of armies, and to the vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance and bravery of our countrymen—theſe diſtreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcenes were never realized! Freedom, peace and independence have bleſſed our land; and the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whom we oppoſed, laying aſide the bitterneſs of civil contention, has extended to us a friendly hand, and now declares herſelf happy in our alliance. A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence to paſt ſcenes ſhould not therefore excite our reſentment; it ſhould only animate us to the vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, the bravery, and the active preparation which proved, under GOD, the means of our deliverance.</p>
            <p>I PROCEED to remark, fourthly, on the neceſſity of government to the exiſtence and defence of any people.</p>
            <p>ONE reaſon aſſigned for the eaſy conqueſt of Laiſh is, "that there was no magiſtrate in the land, who might put them to ſhame in any thing,"—who could puniſh them for doing wrong, or make any man aſhamed of his want of virtue or patriotiſm. Such a people muſt fall an eaſy prey to an invader; for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out government no people can remain in ſecurity, nor can any nation be defended from its enemies.</p>
            <p>BY reſtraining vice, the magiſtrate prevents men from contracting habits of effeminacy. He guards them from weakneſs of mind, and excites them to hardihood and patriotiſm. The great and noble prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of love to our country, of ſacrificing private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to public happineſs, of guarding the rights of poſterity, and diſſeminating univerſal felicity, cannot ſubſiſt in a mind narrowed and depraved by criminal indulgence. Vice makes cowards of mankind. It contracts and ſtifles the nobleſt principles of human action, and renders men abject in their ſentiments and conduct. As far as vice is diſcountenanced, as far as
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:026249_0017_0FCFABE7CE257D90"/>
men are made aſhamed of doing baſe and unworthy actions,—ſo far general ſecurity is increaſed, and the aggregate of national ſtrength is enlarged.</p>
            <p>THE deſign of good government is to form a focus to which all the diverging rays of power in a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity may be collected, and which may enable a people to bring the force of the whole to one point. This accumulated power protects every individual in his rights; it guards the weak from the violence of the ſtrong, and the few from the oppreſſion of the many. The ſame power is competent to defend the whole from invaſion or other injury. Nothing can be done by way of defence where there is no government. Money cannot be raiſed. Men cannot be diſciplin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—nor can any great object be ſteadily purſued. When a people without government are invaded, ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery man will propoſe and purſue his own mode of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. A thouſand different ſchemes will be thrown out. The people will be diſtracted in their views; and before this diſtraction can be calmed, a final con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt may ſave them the trouble of defending them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for the future. A nation rent with diviſions, deſtitute of law, of ſubordination and rulers, preſents a proper object for an attack, becauſe it promiſes an eaſy if not a valuable conqueſt. The very people them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves who have been agitated by different ſcenes, who have no reſt for the ſoles of their feet, who find their lives, their liberties and eſtates afloat, and expoſed to the lawleſs violence of any who may be pleaſed to ſeize them,—this people themſelves will join an invading army, and prefer any ſecurity, any protection to none at all. Without government, indeed, without law and order, there is no liberty, no ſecurity, no peace nor proſperity. Men ought to guard their rights;
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:026249_0018_0FCFABE68537E060"/>
they ought to reſiſt arbitiary power of every kind; they ought to eſtabliſh a free government;—but no people can be ſafe, no nation can be happy where "every man does what is right in his own eyes," and the people are driven about by the whirlwind of their paſſions.</p>
            <p>IF, again, a government is free and juſt, they will be cheerfully ſupported by the people in defending their country. Wars too often ariſe from the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or other paſſions of princes and great men, and the juſtice of them may be properly doubted. Where an intereſt exiſts in the government ſeparate from that of the people, the latter will always feel a jealouſy, and will not be ready to give them effectual ſupport. But where "our rulers are from among ourſelves, and our governors proceed from the midſt of us;" where every man, elevated as his ſtation may be, returns at ſtated periods to the maſs of the people; where our rulers cannot injure us without hurting themſelves,—we may cheerfully acquieſce in their calls to defend our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and may be ſure that they will not wantonly engage in a war, which expoſes them as well as us to heavy expenſe and grievous misfortune. The conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious ſoldier, who will not ſupport a war which he does not believe to be lawful, may here feel his mind perfectly at eaſe, and may diſcover his ſkill and his fortitude in defending his injured country, or ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its juſt claims. Happy people, who are bleſſed with ſuch a government! Happy land, ſhadowed all around with the tree of liberty, and yet ſtrengthened and united by a firm and vigorous government! No wonder that thou art envied by other nations, who are either cruſhed by arbitrary power, or diſtreſſed by confuſion and anarchy!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:026249_0019_0FCFABE50EDC4A70"/>THE reaſons againſt indulging to ſecurity, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting to provide for defence, I obſerve once more, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erate with peculiar force upon a people whoſe diſtant ſituation prevents their receiving aſſiſtance from their allies. The people of Laiſh were far from the Zido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, and had no buſineſs or connexion with any man. The ſacred hiſtorian informs us alſo, that the Danites came "unto Laiſh, unto a people that were at quiet and ſecure, and they ſmote them with the edge of the ſword, and burnt the city with fire, and there was no deliverer, becauſe it was far from Zidon." If a people dwelling thus remotely do not defend and help themſelves, no one can help them. Before their friends and allies can hear of their diſtreſs, it may be complete; and they may be ſubdued and ruined be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the leaſt aſſiſtance can be given them. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration ſhould operate ſtrongly upon a nation thus ſituated, and induce them to keep themſelves in a conſtant ſtate of defence; to cultivate military ſkill and diſcipline among the inhabitants; to be provided with all the means of defence; to keep a vigilant eye upon the ſtate of all nations, ſo that they may not be ſurpriſed on a ſudden; and to put all their fortreſſes into ſuch a condition, as that they may be able to check a ſudden attack, and give time for the people, the natural bulwarks of the State, to aſſemble and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt their daring invaders.</p>
            <p>THE paſt diſcourſe, you muſt be ſenſible, hath had a reſpect to the ſituation of this country, and the duty of this day. We, my fellow citizens, dwell in a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant part of the world, far removed from any allies, and very little intereſted in the politics of Europe. This circumſtance ſhould not only operate to excite us to pay a cloſe attention to the ſtate of our militia,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:026249_0020_0FCFABE381AAC5E8"/>
and the means of our defence, but it ſhould prevent us from engaging in their quarrels, or adopting their wars. Our aſſiſtance can be of very little benefit to them, but it may eſſentially injure us. Our country is young, and cannot bear the loſs of men, which is the certain conſequence of war. It is free, and does not wiſh its citizens to mix with the ſlaves of Europe, and catch their ſervile manners. It venerates relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, and will find no advantage, ſhould its people aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociate with thoſe who deſpiſe religion, and trample upon every divine law. In caſe of a war, we cannot be ſupported or aſſiſted by any European power as they can ſupport one another; and America may be eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially injured before our allies in Europe can know that an enemy has attacked us. GOD in his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence has placed us in a remote part of the world, and if our brethren in other countries "fall out by the way," we will endeavour to reconcile them, but we will not become partners in their quarrels. They have a right to chooſe their own governments, and manage their own affairs, without our interference. GOD does not call us to war. We are not attacked nor endangered; until we are, we have no right to ſpill our own blood, or that of our children. Let us then "ſtudy the things that make for peace." Let us unite in repreſſing thoſe reſtleſs ſpirits who cannot ſee a quarrel going on without inſerting themſelves in it. Let us be ready conſtantly to exert our good offices in bringing about peace; and let us devoutly pray that GOD would haſten the time when "wars ſhall ceaſe from the earth," and the peaceful kingdom of JESUS CHRIST, which breathes nothing but good will to men, ſhall univerſally prevail.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:026249_0021_0FCFABE0C227BA30"/>THROUGH the goodneſs of GOD, America now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys a great degree of peace. She has paſſed through an arduous conteſt, and having ſtruggled long with formidable diſtreſſes, ſhe is effectually relieved; and while ſhe breathen the pure and fragrant air of lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty, her proſperity rapidly increaſes, and her branches extend far and wide. On our frontiers indeed a cloud, not bigger than a man's hand, has ariſen, and has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to a formidable and diſtreſſing degree. Our armies have been defeated, and we mourn the brave men who have fallen in the wilderneſs, and whoſe bones are now whitening in the ſun. It is not for me to determine upon the neceſſity or expedience of this war. As a miniſter of religion, I can only wiſh and pray for peace, and anticipate the time when "the ſword of the wilderneſs" ſhall deſtroy no more.</p>
            <p>IF, my brethren, we mean to guard ourſelves from invaſion, and to lengthen out our tranquillity, we muſt cultivate a good government; we muſt reverence the laws, and ſupport the magiſtrate in "putting to ſhame thoſe that do evil." It is a duty enjoined by our holy religion to ſubmit to ſuch government and it is a maxim founded in eternal truth, that no people can be conquered or deſtroyed who are united in ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a free and good conſtitution. A conſciouſneſs of being freemen, of being protected in the enjoyment of life and property, by laws which know not the rich from the poor, or the great from the ſmall; this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs will give men elevation of ſentiment; it will inſpire them with fortitude and perſeverance, and make them ſuperior to all the ſlaves and ſycophants upon earth.</p>
            <p>WHILE we ſupport our various conſtitutions of government, and guard againſt inteſtine diviſions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:026249_0022_0FCFABDBC99068F8"/>
ought to pay a ſtrict attention to the ſtate of our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia, and the other means of defence. Americans will never ſuffer a ſtanding army among them in time of peace. The militia are the natural defenders of this country. They have a ſtake in it. They have a ſhare in its ſovereignty; and they fight for their wives, their children, their liberty, and their all. Such men cannot be cowards; they muſt be brave and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined; and when any of theſe bleſſings are taken from them, or threatened to be done away, they will be "like a bear robbed of her whelps," and will deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine to conquer or die.</p>
            <p>BUT this very ardor and impetuoſity may be fatal to them, unleſs they are under the direction of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and diſcipline. Theſe are neceſſary to check their efferveſcences, and lead their efforts to ſuch points as may be moſt beneficial. Our militia then ſhould be diſciplined. Our young men ſhould be early in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the art of war, and every one ſhould hold himſelf in readineſs to "play the man for his people, and the cities of his GOD." Let us have our fortreſſes in good repair, and be ready at all points to reſiſt an invaſion; and this is the moſt likely method to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it.</p>
            <p>YOUR inſtitution, Gentlemen of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company, is deſigned to anſwer this important purpoſe, and is a ſtriking proof of the wiſdom and foreſight of our anceſtors. Venerable men! My heart warms when I view the ſchools, the colleges, the churches which they founded; and when I ſee this Company aſſembled, ſo admirably adapted "upon all our glory to create a defence."

            <p>YOU are citizens, Gentlemen, as well as ſoldiers, and you know the neceſſity of order and government. Theſe you will feel it your duty to ſupport and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, while you value and defend the liberty of your country. You know that theſe duties do not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere. You know that without government freedom cannot ſubſiſt, becauſe government alone can protect the helpleſs individual, or reſtrain the lordly tyrant. You know alſo that a free government is neceſſary to animate and direct the efforts of a people in their own defence, and that the tree of liberty never flouriſhes, unleſs it is preſerved from rude violence by the ſacred barriers of law and juſtice.</p>
            <p>COUNTENANCED by the Commander in chief, who himſelf formerly led a corps in ſome reſpects ſimilar to your own, and encouraged by the good wiſhes and plaudits of your fellow citizens, you are becoming every year more uſeful and reſpectable. The choice which you have made of men to command you, who have known not only the parade, but the reality of war, and have bravely defended the liberties of Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ica, has done you and your country honor. Men of the firſt abilities have been heretofore the objects of your choice; and I hope that the elections of this day will prove, that you are ſtill governed by the ſame wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and prudence, which in this reſpect have hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore marked your conduct.</p>

Sure I am, that you would never turn your backs to an enemy, or ſuffer your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be defeated. You are Americans. You are deſcendants of men, who ſacrificed every thing to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert their liberty. Many of you have "jeoparded your lives on the high places of the field," and your boſoms glow with genuine patriotiſm. Such men are invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Nothing can ſubdue them but the power of that Being who hath declared, "that the race is not always to the ſwift, nor the battle to the ſtrong."</p>
            <p>GO on, Gentlemen, and proſper. In peace prepare for war. Cultivate in your own breaſts, and impreſs upon your children, an ardent love to civil and relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious liberty. And while you diſcharge your duty to ſociety, forget not the Being who has made you what you are, at whoſe tribunal you muſt all ſtand, and whoſe "favour is better than life." If you ſubmit to his Goſpel, and are governed in heart and in life by its precepts, you ſhall be made "more than conquerors;" your brows ſhall be adorned with unfading laurels, and your triumphs ſhall be complete and eternal!</p>
            <p>WE live, my brethren of this aſſembly, in a day when grand and important ſcenes are acting upon the theatre of the world.

We hear "of wars and rumours of wars." Mankind "bite and devour one another." "Brother is purſuing brother

unto death," and the earth is crimſoned, deeply crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, with Chriſtian blood. Humanity ſheds a tear over the folly of her ſons, but faith lifts her keen and humble eye from earth to heaven, and anticipates the good which ſhall come out of this evil: She expects the fulfilment of thoſe precious promiſes which ſpeak of the future peace and happineſs of man; and teaches us to exclaim, "amidſt the wreck of nature and the cruſh of worlds," ALLELUIA, THE LORD GOD OM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIPOTENT REIGNETH."</p>
