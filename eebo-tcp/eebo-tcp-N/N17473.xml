            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO HENRY FUSELI, <hi>A. M.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>TAKE, dear obſerver of men, from the hand of your unbiaſſed friend, this teſtimony of eſteem for your genius.</p>
            <p>All the world know that this is no flattery; for, in an hundred things, I am not of your opinion; but, in what concerns the knowledge of mankind, we are nearer to one another than any two in ten thouſand.</p>
            <p>What I give here is the reſult of long experience, matured and confirmed by various and daily application. It will be found, I hope, an uſeful book for every claſs of men, from the throne to the cottage. All is not, cannot be, new; but all ought to be true, uſeful, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant; and much, I truſt, is new and individual.</p>
            <p>I give you liberty not only to make improvements, but to omit what you think falſe or unimportant.</p>
            <p>The number of rules may appear large, yet it is ſmall compared to what might have been written; in the mean time you and I, as well as our readers, may find ample employment in ſtudying theſe.</p>

            <p>IN the following collection of Aphoriſms the reader is not to expect a ſet of maxims compiled from the author's own, or by him ſelected from the works of others; but an original, meditated and compoſed in the ſeries here offered during the autumn of <hi>1787,</hi> and trarſmitted in the author's own manuſcript to the publiſher.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the rapidity that attended this work, (and the world know that all this author's works are affuſions,) it will be found to contain what gives their value to maxims—verdicts of wiſdom on the reports of experience. If ſome are truiſms, let it be conſidered that Sclomon and Hippocrates wrote truiſms: if ſome are not new, they are recommended by an air of novelty: if whim ſhould appear to have dictated others, it was the whim of humanity; and what may be deamed raſh will be found to flow from the fervour of indignant honeſly, or the exultations of benevolence. Acute and perſpicuous, they are not infected by the cant of ſects, or circumſcribed by local notions, but general as the paſſions and feelings of the race.</p>
            <p>It is the intention of the editor to add another volume of <hi>AMPHORISMS ON ART, WITH CHARACTERS AND EXAMPLES,</hi> not indeed by the ſame author, which the reader may expect in the courſe of the year.</p>

The ſtory of the painter and the prince is well known: to get at the beſt piece in the artiſt's collection, the prince ordered fire to be cried in the neighbourhood—at the firſt noiſe the artiſt abruptly left the prince, and ſeized his darling—his Titian. The alarm proved a falſe one, but the object of purchaſe was fixed. The application is eaſy: of thouſands it may be decided what loſs, what gain, would affect them moſt. This the ſage of Nazareth meant when he ſaid, <hi>Where thy treaſure is, there will thy heart be alſo.</hi>—The object of your love is your God.</p>
