            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>An ADDRESS, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THOUGH Chriſtianity was deſigned to be productive of the moſt happy effects on mankind, even to reſtore them to the divine Favour, and to qualify them for the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the divine Preſence,—how few are there of its profeſſors, who appear, by their practice, to advert to the nature and end of this diſpenſation of mercy.</p>
            <p>How many who are openly regardleſs of its precepts of virtue, and pride themſelves in their unrighteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>Of thoſe whoſe external demeanor is not ſo reprehenſible, and who pay ſome attention to the outward duties of religion, is it not to be feared there are vaſt numbers who are ſtrangers to its ſpirit; who entertain unjuſt ideas con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it; who flatter themſelves they are the heirs of redemption, when their ſins are unab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved;
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:019154_0003_0FAA5DE386A48020"/>
their hearts unrenewed, and, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, they are the objects of divine diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure?</p>
            <p>And, it is preſumed, you are now ſenſible, that until very lately, even yourſelves were of the number of thoſe who are nominal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors only of the goſpel, and, therefore, in that "broad way of iniquity that leadeth to deſtruction!"</p>
            <p>But, happily, through divine goodneſs, it is hoped, that you now have more perfect conceptions of Chriſtianity and of your ſtate through ſin!—That you are now convinced of its nature and demerits!—That you now, from principle, deteſt it; wiſh to be delivered from its penalty; to be liberated from its power; to poſſeſs holineſs of heart, and the favour of heaven!</p>
            <p>YOU are, however, involved in diſtreſs. You weep for ſin, without comfort! You ſeek the divine favour; but do not obtain it! You are athirſt for the waters of life; but cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach them! And, perhaps, ſome of you are tempted to conclude, that never was any ſorrow equal to that with which you are afflicted!</p>
            <p>BUT ſuffer not yourſelves to deſpair of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from your ſtate of woe! And permit me to endeavour to miniſter conſolation to
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:019154_0004_0FAA5DE440C97250"/>
you, and to offer ſome advice ſuitable to your ſituation.</p>
            <p>STRANGE, indeed, would it be, if, on per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the perfidy, vileneſs and ingratitude of ſin; and the miſeries to which it expoſes you,—even to eternal death, you ſhould not be moſt ſenſibly moved!</p>
            <p>Is it reaſonable to imagine that the HEART <hi>itſelf</hi> can be <hi>broken</hi> by <hi>contrition</hi> and <hi>not</hi> be <hi>pained?</hi>—Does not our Lord aſſure us, we <hi>muſt "mourn"</hi> for our offences, before we ſhall be "<hi>comforted</hi>" with a ſenſe of the Almighty's affection? And that we <hi>muſt feel</hi> the burthen of iniquity, previous to our being <hi>delivered</hi> from its <hi>preſſure?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But have you not every reaſon to hope you may be freed from the guilt of ſin and its effects?</p>
            <p>On account of your tranſgreſſions you are expoſed to the curſe of the divine law: and of yourſelves you are unable to appeaſe heavenly juſtice. You perceive the "wages of ſin is death:"<note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. vi. 23.<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </note> and that, therefore, ſhould "God be extreme to mark what you have done amiſs,"<note n="†" place="bottom">Pſal. cxxx. 3.</note> you muſt ſink beneath the weight of divine vengeance!</p>
            <p>

            <p>And, in divine compaſſion, are you not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to repair to God for the enjoyment of his love?</p>
            <p>Is it not written, that "he who covereth his ſins ſhall not proſper; but that he who confeſſeth and forſaketh them, through faith in the merits of Chriſt, "ſhall find mercy?"<note n="§" place="bottom">Prov. xxviii. 13.</note>

            <p>There is a great diverſity in penitents with reſpect to their apprehenſions of the nature of evil; the diſtreſs they experience by reaſon of their ſins, and the degrees of ſatisfaction, peace and joy they are favoured with.</p>
            <p>No one perſon's experience, therefore, in theſe particulars, can juſtly be regarded as a ſtandard to which others muſt be equal, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can be eſteemed Chriſtians, indeed.</p>

            <p>How often and explicitly, is the duty of prayer enjoined on you by divine authority?</p>

            <p>It hath been remarked, that thoſe perſons who have been diſtinguiſhed for piety, have alſo been diſtinguiſhed for their attention to devotion; the practice of which is abſolutely neceſſary to your proficiency in grace.</p>

            <p>FOURTHLY: When you ſhall obtain conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, through Chriſt, commemorate his death and paſſion, in the manner he hath preſcribed.</p>
            <p>The Jewiſh paſſover was inſtituted to be a memorial of the divine goodneſs, in preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the people of Iſrael from deſtruction, when
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:019154_0018_0FAA5DF1C7F4F108"/>

            </p>
            <p>This ordinance was typical of our delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from eternal death, "through the ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the blood of Chriſt,"<note n="†" place="bottom">1 Pet. i. 2.</note> and was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by him until he ordained, in its place, a new Paſchal Supper, on the evening imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately preceding his paſſion.</p>
            <p>At that period, "he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, ſaying, This is my body which is given for you! This do in remembrance of me! Likewiſe alſo the cup, after ſupper, ſaying, This cup is the New Teſtament in my blood, which I ſhed for you!"<note n="‡" place="bottom">Luke xxii. 19, 20.</note>
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>As this ſervice is explicitly enjoined on us,— "This do in remembrance of me;"—as it is in itſelf moſt reaſonable, and is attended with great advantages to ourſelves; to neglect it therefore, is to ſin, not only againſt God, but alſo againſt our own ſouls!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:019154_0019_0FAA5DF280382AE8"/>FIFTHLY: Embrace each opportunity of hearing the divine word preached.</p>
            <p>Should the preacher, at any time, happen to be of a denomination different from that by which you are diſtinguiſhed, hear him without prejudice, and with a deſire to receive edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from what he may deliver.</p>
            <p>Remember that truth is truth, by whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is ſpoken; and that the preaching of <hi>no perſon whatever</hi> ſhould be regarded by you, <hi>any farther</hi> than it is <hi>agreeable</hi> to the <hi>ſacred oracles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some perſons, that they may receive the greateſt advantage from the ſermons they hear, make a practice of reducing their texts, and alſo the ſubſtance of the diſcourſes, to writing; and it muſt be granted that ſuch conduct may be particularly beneficial, and render ſermons more permanently uſeful.</p>
            <p>SIXTHLY: Avoid bigotry and a ſpirit of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious diſputation The former is reproachful to Chriſtianity, and is often productive of bad conſequences: and the latter, it is conceived, is attended with many more evil, than good effects. It is frequently ſubverſive of the ſpirit of the goſpel, and occaſions, in men, wrath, hatred, pride, and other ſinful paſſions.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>In the firſt age of the goſpel, when its profeſſors were ſeriouſly concerned to obtain ſalvation, they poſſeſſed the greateſt affection for each other; they being, we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, "of one heart, and of one mind."</p>
                  <p>But when the profeſſors of Chriſtianity began to be deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of its ſpirit, they divided into ſects and parties; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained hatred and prejudice againſt one another, merely by reaſon they diſagreed in religious ſentiments; and often for a particular ſo immaterial as this, deprived each other of many earthly bleſſings, and even of life itſelf! And, perhaps, with much greater zeal, than they executed juſtice on perſons guilty of the moſt flagrant acts of wickedneſs!</p>
                  <p>The ſacred writings give no countenance to religious prejudice, enmity, animoſity and contention, but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe. "Judge not," ſays our Lord, "that ye be not judged." Matt. vii. 1.</p>
                  <p>Before the Apoſtles had received the gift of the Holy Ghoſt, and, conſequently, while unacquainted with the ſpirit of the goſpel, they "ſaw one caſting out devils in the name of Chriſt," and took upon them to "forbid him; becauſe he followed not with them." But their conduct, in this inſtance, was diſapproved of by their divine Maſter. Mark ix. 38.</p>
                  <p>"Him that is weak in the ſaith," ſaith Saint Paul, "receive ye," (in affection) "but not to doubtful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation."</p>
                  <p>He adds: "Who art thou that judgeſt another man's ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant? To his own maſter he ſtandeth or falleth."—"Why doſt thou judge thy brother? Or why doſt thou ſet at nought thy brother? For we ſhall all ſtand before the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeat of Chriſt." "Every one of us ſhall give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of himſelf to God. Let us not, therefore, judge one another any more." Rom. xiv.</p>
                  <p>Happy would it be, if Chriſtians in general, were as ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous to excel in piety, as apparently they are, in ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxy of faith!—Is it not to be feared, there are many that are <hi>heretical</hi> in their <hi>practice,</hi> who <hi>pride themſelves</hi> in the <hi>truth</hi> of their <hi>principles?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Uncharitable it would be, not to admit there are <hi>ſome,</hi> of every denomination of Chriſtians, who obtain ſalvation. And if CHRIST <hi>himſelf</hi> receives into his kingdom, <hi>thoſe</hi> who differ from us in religious opinion and mode of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, why ſhould not WE receive <hi>ſuch</hi> into the arms of affection?</p>
                  <p>If, in a ſhort period, <hi>one heaven,</hi> will receive all the ſaints on earth, wherefore ſhould they not endeavour to be as affectionate to each other <hi>here,</hi> as they will be <hi>hereafter?</hi>
                  </p>

               <p>ABOUT three years ſince, the Author of the preceding Addreſs, preached a Sermon, in Kingwood, in the State of New-Jerſey, on the ſubject of Regeneration, which diſcourſe was then printed.</p>
               <p>Several perſons, on whom, through divine goodneſs, it made ſerious and happy impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, requeſted the Author to compoſe a prayer, adapted to their ſituation, and to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex it to the ſermon.</p>
               <p>This requeſt was complied with; and that form of devotion is now re-printed, for the advantage of ſuch perſons of penitence as may read this pamphlet, and have occaſion of aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in their addreſſes to the Almighty.</p>

               <head>THE PRAYER.</head>
               <p>O THOU that art my Creator, preſerver and benefactor! Againſt thee, O God! againſt thee have I ſinned! With ſhame and ſorrow, I acknowledge and deplore my manifold tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, which render me moſt unworthy of thy favour, and juſtly expoſe me to thy indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and wrath!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="unknown:019154_0039_0FAA5CCCA4BDBF18"/>But O thou who art a God of pity; that delighteſt not in the death of a ſinner, but wouldeſt rather he ſhould turn from his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs and live, look down, I humbly beſeech thee; in condeſcenſive goodneſs look down from thy throne of mercy, and behold me in compaſſion! Pardon, I intreat thee, my ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, through the merits of thy beloved Son! Through the purity of his blood, may I be cleanſed from ſinful defilement! Give peace to my troubled mind, and let me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an object of thy affection!</p>
               <p>Deliver me, O Lord! I pray thee, not only from the puniſhment due to ſin, but alſo from its power and dominion! Let it no longer reign in my mortal body! No longer may I be in bondage to the Prince of Darkneſs! No longer may I even incline tranſgreſs thy holy law! Through the power of thy grace, may all evil be mortified and ſubdued in me! Through the efficacy of thy ſpirit, may my ſoul be regenerated; be renewed, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into thy likeneſs! May my mind be duly illuminated with the light of divine truth! May my affections be ſupremely fixed on thee, O God! who art moſt worthy of all love! And henceforth, may my life be intirely conformable to thy righteous will!</p>
               <p>Though numerous foes may aſſault me in the path of ſalvation, yet, O Lord God of ſtrength! through thy aid, may they be van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed!
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:019154_0040_0FAA5CCF62D78A58"/>
May I be enabled to triumph over all oppoſition in the practice of religion; to go on from one degree of holineſs to another, and, at length, arrive to the fulneſs of chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian perfection!</p>
               <p>Ever be pleaſed to indulge me, O Lord, I beſeech thee! with the light of thy counten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance! At all times may I be favoured with the conſolations and joys of thy holy ſpirit! And may I be preſerved from every thing that ſhall be either offenſive to thee; reproachful to chriſtianity, or injurious to myſelf! Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, from ſpiritual pride; from an uncharitable diſpoſition, and a preſumptuous confidence in my own ability to conflict with ſin and Satan! As without thy aſſiſtance, O God! I cannot do any thing that is good, wilt thou, in mercy, incline and enable me ſucceſsfully to approach thee in all thy holy ways, that from thee I may receive a ſupply of grace for all my ſpiritual wants! And prepare, O Lord! with ardour I implore thee; prepare my heart, in due ſeaſon, to draw near, in an acceptable manner, to that holy ſacrament, appointed by the merciful and divine Jeſus, to be expreſſive of his death, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he ſhall come again! In mercy grant, that the emblems of his holy paſſion, may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by me with the profoundeſt reverence; and with the moſt fervent gratitude, love and praiſe! That at this ſacred banquet, each grace and virtue in me may be nouriſhed, eſtabliſhed,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:019154_0041_0FAA5CD04666FA20"/>
and confirmed! And that a proper ſenſe of the ſufferings of thy beloved Son, for the atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of human guilt, may occaſion me pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to perceive the demerits of ſin, and cauſe me to flee it with the utmoſt deteſtation and abhorrence!</p>
               <p>O Father of mercies, the God of love and of grace! What ſhall be rendered unto thee for thy inconceivably rich and unmerited cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, manifeſted to ſinful men, through the Son of thy affection! How ſhall I ſufficiently admire, adore, and praiſe thee, that I enjoy the glorious light of the goſpel! That not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all my ſins, thou haſt ſo long waited to be gracious to me! And that thou haſt now inclined my ſoul to make my peace with thee, and to weep for my offences! O that my repentance may be ſuch as ſhall need not to be repented of! That my faith in Chriſt may increaſe in ſtrength! And that I may be thine, for ever thine!</p>
               <p>Lord, humbly do I commit myſelf unto thee! To thee do I offer myſelf a ſacrifice, both ſoul and body, which is my reaſonable ſervice! O that thou wouldeſt deign to accept of the unworthy offering! That thy arm of omnipotence may ever be extended for my ſafety! That, through thy goodneſs, I may eſcape the temptations of the world, the fleſh and the devil, and at laſt enter into thy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly kingdom!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="unknown:019154_0042_0FAA5CD21FB5F738"/>Grant it, O Lord! thou who heareſt the petitions of humble ſuppliants; grant it with humility and fervency I pray, for the ſake of the merits and mediation of the divine, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate Jeſus; to whom with thee and the Holy Ghoſt, three Perſons, but one God, be aſcribed all honour and glory, adoration and praiſe, now, henceforth, and for ever! Amen!</p>
