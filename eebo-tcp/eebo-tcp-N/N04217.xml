            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Introduction of well qualified Perſons into the miniſterial Office, being of ſuch Importance to the true Intereſt of Chriſtianity, it was found worthy of <hi>apoſtolick</hi> Inſpection and Care. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly we find the <hi>Apoſtle Paul,</hi> the inſpired and learned Writer of this <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> filling up <hi>ſix Verſes,</hi> in the Beginning of this Chapter, with ſerious Advice and Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Timothy</hi> about it, and purſuing the ſame Argument in many other Paſſages of his <hi>Epiſtles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The great <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> firſt of all, allows it to be a <hi>true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Saying, that if a Man deſire the Office of a Biſhop,</hi> an Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeer and Teacher in the Church of CHRIST, <hi>he deſireth a good Work;</hi> an honourable (however, at the ſame Time, a labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and dangerous) Function. It is a moſt uſeful and ſacred Employment, a <hi>good Work,</hi> whereby the Glory of CHRIST, and the Salvation of Men are greatly promoted: For 'tis the evident Deſign of the Inſtitution of the <hi>evangelical Miniſtry</hi> to inſtruct and ſave a miſerable World, and thereby advance the Glory of <hi>divine Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The good <hi>Apoſtle</hi> then proceeds to ennumerate the ſuperior and neceſſary Qualifications of <hi>a Biſhop,</hi> or <hi>good Miniſter</hi> of JESUS CHRIST, which <hi>Timothy</hi> muſt carefully obſerve, in admitting Perſons to this high and ſacred Office; which
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005198_0005_1016E1C7749E2B48"/>amount to no leſs than <hi>ſixteen in the ſix following Verſes, viz. A Biſhop muſt be blameleſs; The Huſband of one Wife,</hi> that is, <q>One that has not put away his Wife for every Cauſe (as the Manner of ſome then was) and married another;<note n="†" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> in Loc.</note>
               </q> 
               <hi>vigilant; ſober; of good Behaviour; given to Hoſpitality;</hi> APT TO TEACH; <hi>not given to Wine; no Striker; not greedy of fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Lucre, but patient; not a Brawler; not covetous: one that ruleth well his own Houſe, having his Children in Subjection with all Gravity; for if a Man know not how to rule his own Houſe, how ſhall he take Care of the Church of God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fifteenth Qualification of a Goſpel Miniſter, which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> here gives <hi>Timothy,</hi> is contained in this wiſe Caution, viz. NOT A NOVICE; <hi>that is,</hi> as 'tis expreſſed in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of the Bible, <hi>one newly come to the Faith:</hi> Plainly intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that a <hi>Biſhop</hi> muſt be well inſtructed and eſtabliſhed in the Faith. <hi>Every Scribe, which is inſtructed unto the Kingdom of Heaven, is like unto a Man that is an Houſholder, which bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth out of his Treaſure Things new and old.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 13, 52.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Greek</hi> Word anſwering to the Engliſh one, NOVICE, is <hi>Neophutos,</hi> "Which properly ſignifies, one that is but newly planted, or inſtructed in the Faith." "A raw young Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian." And this inſpired <hi>Apoſtle</hi> abſolutely forbids, that ſuch an one ſhould be admitted into <hi>holy Orders.</hi> And the ſubjoins a very ſolemn Reaſon, which loudly beſpeaks the great Danger of ſuch an one's Undertaking this Miniſtry; viz. <hi>Leſt being lifted up with Pride, he fall into the Condemnation of the Devil:</hi> both into the Devil's <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Puniſhment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> well obſerves, that <hi>Neophutos,</hi> NOVICE, "Signifies not in Reſpect of Age," for <hi>Timothy</hi> himſelf was ſuch, yet the Apoſtle gave him Authority to command and teach in the Church, and ſuffered no Man to deſpiſe <hi>his Youth:</hi> But it "ſignifies in Reſpect of receiving the Faith," one new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought over to the Profeſſion of the Chriſtian Faith, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther young or old. So then according to the genuine Uſe of the Word, a Man may be a Novice, or Babe in underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Myſteries of the Goſpel, and ſo very unqualified to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the miniſterial Office, who, in <hi>Reſpect of Age,</hi> may be honoured as a <hi>Father</hi> or <hi>Maſter:</hi> And on the other Hand, a
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005198_0006_1016E1F5EDF313A8"/>Perſon that is <hi>young in Years</hi> may yet be freed from the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of a <hi>Novice,</hi> as was young <hi>Timothy</hi> in Reſpect of his good moral and miniſterial Accompliſhments, and ſo be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted worthy of ſome eccleſiaſtical Dignity and Preferment.</p>
            <p>The laſt Qualification of a <hi>Biſhop</hi> here mentioned, is, in the 7 Ver. in theſe Words, <hi>He muſt have a good Report of them which are without, leſt he fall into Reproach, and the Snare of the Devil,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such are the Apoſtolick Directions here given to <hi>Timothy</hi> about introducing Men into the Goſpel-Miniſtry; and they are of ſtanding Uſe to the Church of CHRIST, and ſhould be carefully obſerved by all thoſe whoſe Office it is to confer <hi>holy Orders.</hi> Hence the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> alſo adds that ſolemn Caution, in the fifth Chapter of this Epiſtle and twenty-ſecond Verſe, <hi>Lay Hands ſuddenly on no Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall now give you the Sum of the whole Matter in this doctrinal Note, viz.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> That it is of very dangerous Tendency for <hi>unqualified</hi> Perſons to be <hi>employed in the ſacred Miniſtry:</hi> Or, that the <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the Churches</hi> ſhould uſe <hi>great Caution and Vigilance in admitting Perſons to the miniſterial Office.</hi> For the Danger of putting unſuitable and unqualified Men into the evangelical Miniſtry is much every Way, tho' the <hi>Text</hi> confines it to the Perſons that dare invade this ſacred Office in a State of NO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VICESHIP.</p>
            <p>But yet, as Neceſſity is laid upon the Officers of the Church to exclude ſuch from the Miniſtry, they are in Danger of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving themſelves in the ſame Guilt and Condemnation, by opening a wide Door of Entrance, and proſtituting the holy Miniſtry to every bold Intruder. <hi>Be not Partaker of other Men's Sins, that ye receive not of their Plagues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, ſuch unfaithful Miniſters are the very Inſtruments of enhancing the Guilt and Puniſhment of every ſuch <hi>Novice,</hi> by admitting them to a Dignity and Office for which they have not one <hi>canonical</hi> Qualification. This is the Mean of <hi>lifting them up with Pride,</hi> and precipitating them into the <hi>Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Devil.</hi> So then, the <hi>Danger</hi> of employing <hi>unqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified</hi> Men in the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> is greater, and of more extenſive bad Influence than is at firſt imagined; yea, the important Intereſt of Chriſtianity is vaſtly affected by this prepoſterous
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:005198_0007_1016E1C904A3CE20"/>and evil Practice, as may be ſhewn in the Sequel of this Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Danger</hi> hereof is great,
<list>
                  <item>Firſt, To every NOVICE who undertakes the Work of the Miniſtry.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, To every <hi>Officer in the Church</hi> who authoriſeth their Miſſion.</item>
                  <item>Thirdly, The Danger hereof is great to the <hi>Souls</hi> of them that are <hi>taught and led by them.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Fourthly, The Miniſtry of unqualified Men is of very dangerous and deſtructive Tendency to the <hi>true Intereſt of Religion.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The Seaſonableneſs and Importance of this Subject, in theſe Times, led my Thoughts to the Choice of it, when my <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Brother</hi> asked me to ſtand in his Place, and be his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitor upon this ſolemn Occaſion.

            <p>GOD knows the reigning Pride and Naughtineſs of his Heart, at the ſame Time that he pretends to be high in the Favour of GOD, zealous for his Glory, and crucified to the World: And <hi>when he is judged, he ſhall be condemned.</hi>

He alſo that has but newly embraced the Chriſtian Faith, and received CHRIST, may alſo be under peculiar and ſtrong Temptations to Pride and Vanity, by receiving eccleſiaſtical Preferment; eſpecially, if he be brought out of a State of dark Heatheniſm into this marvellous Light anti Grace. A true Convert may be juſtly ſtiled a <hi>Novice</hi> in the Things of GOD, and deemed very unworthy of the miniſterial Office. So great a Dignity, ſo ſuddenly beſtowed on him, may tempt him to Pride, ſuch a Preferment in the Church tends directly to feed his Pride; and exalt him above Meaſure. For there is the Remainder of this ſpiritual Luſt in the Regenerate, and it is a ſecret and dangerous Enemy to their Salvation; and alas! who are in more Danger of falling into this <hi>Snare of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> than Perſons of little Knowledge, and great Zeal? Or than <hi>Novices</hi> in Religion?</p>
            <p>Such Perſons are very unfit to have the Inſtruction and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church committed to them, however wiſe and ſufficient they are in their own Conceits for theſe Things. This Affectation of being Teachers in the Church of CHRIST may, and doth commonly ariſe from bad Cauſes; ſuch as groſs Ignorance, Partiality, Pride, Self-Conceit, Love of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Applauſes, Preſumption and Confidence; and ſuch as are influenced by it would do well to examine and know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and the Principles and Motives by which they are rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for 'tis no uncommon Thing to ſee the worſt Deſigns covered under the goodly Appearance of religious Zeal, and high Pretences to the SPIRIT.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Novices</hi> are <hi>Babes in Underſtanding,</hi> and have Need that one teach them which be the <hi>firſt Principles of the Oracles of GOD,</hi> inſtead of taking to themſelves the Office of publick Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Ignorance, Conceit, and Pride too often conſiſt together in the ſame Subject, and betray Perſons into wild and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant Conduct. We read in I Cor. 4.19. <hi>Of the Speech of them which are puffed up.</hi> Such are apt to boaſt of a falſe Gift, and pride themſelves in ſome high Accompliſhments, which exiſt only in their vain Imaginations. The Scripture ſuppoſeth that a <hi>Man may think himſelf to be ſomething, when he is nothing,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Gal. 6.3.</note> and thereby deceive himſelf, and not only ſo,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005198_0010_1016E1FA968B06D0"/>but be a Deriſion alſo to all about him. <hi>Be not wiſe in your own Conceits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Pride has always been the Bane of the Church, as it was the Ruin of the Devil. And how myſterious ſoever it be, that Pride ſhould enter into ſuch pure, intellectual Beings, as were the fallen Angels in their firſt Eſtate, yet it is not at all ſtrange to account for the Working of it in an apoſtate Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. It is here inſinuated that Pride was the Devil's Sin, what threw him headlong into Perdition; this is the Offspring of the Devil, and full of all Subtilty and Miſchief, the Spirit that worketh in the Children of Diſobedience, and <hi>that luſteth to Envy</hi> in the Regenerate.</p>
            <p>"It ſeems the Devil was tempted by the glorious Condition wherein he was created to aſpire after the <hi>Godhead,</hi>" and be as GOD; and this was the Snare the Devil laid to ſeduce &amp; ruin our firſt Parents in their primitive and exalted State. For ſo the Devil inſinuates to our Mother <hi>Eve, That God knew, that in the Day they eat of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, then their Eyes ſhould be opened, and they ſhould be as Gods, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Good and Evil.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Gen. 3.5.</note> So that a dignified State is not out of the Reach of Temptation to Pride; but ſuch as receive ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Honours may be expoſed to peculiar and dangerous Temptations. Eſpecially <hi>Novices</hi> are in great Danger of growing giddy and lordly in ſuch an elevated State in the Church; and ſuch Perſons indeed moſt commonly <hi>love to have the Preheminence,</hi> and are moſt apt to be confident, aſſuming and deſirous of <hi>vain Glory.</hi> Vain Man has naturally an inſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable Thirſt after Honour, not conſidering that Promotion is a mighty Incentive to Pride.</p>
            <p>Pride, Pride is the Enemy of all Righteouſneſs, and the true Source of Abundance of Miſchief to the Church of GOD. The wiſe Man obſerves, <hi>Only by Pride cometh Contention;</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Prov. 13.10.</note> though it has many Coverings and Windings to hide and transform it ſelf in.

            <p n="2">2. <hi>A Novice by being promoted to eccleſiaſtical Dignity is in Danger of falling into the Condemnation of the Devil:</hi> For ſo the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> teacheth us, leſt—<hi>he fall into the Condemnation of the Devil.</hi> This is the Condemnation that is moſt dreadful and amazing.</p>
            <p>Pride was the leading Step, the ſad Prologue and Preſage to that Condemnation into which the Devil fell, who was caſt out of Heaven into the Torments of Hell. This is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of the Devil. Saith the Apoſtle <hi>Peter, God ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not the Angels that ſinned, but caſt them down to Hell, and delivered them into Chains of Darkneſs, to be reſerved unto Judgment.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Pet. 2.4.</note> So true is the wiſe Man's Obſervation, <hi>Pride goeth before Deſtruction, and an haughty Spirit before a Fall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Devil, and our firſt Parents, and the Children of Pride, have found it ſo of a Truth by a woful Experience: <hi>Thoſe that walk in Pride, he is able to abaſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Places of the higheſt Dignity in Church and State, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the moſt ſlippery and dangerous; and it may be the Pinacle of the Temple, the higheſt Preferments in the Church, are of all others the moſt ſo.—Which Conſideration is enough, one would think, to reſtrain the Ambition of vain Minds, to influence all that are Candidates for the miniſterial Office and Dignity, to enter upon it with Humility, Fear and Trembling, and with the moſt Chriſtian Views and Deſigns.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Novices,</hi> or <hi>unqualified</hi> Perſons, who thruſt themſelves into the <hi>Office of a Biſhop,</hi> and take this Honour to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves they are in manifeſt Danger of falling into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of the Devil. Hence we have that wiſe Caution of the Apoſtle <hi>James, My Brethren, be not many Maſters or
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005198_0012_1016E1FD4A87ADC0"/>Teachers, knowing that we ſhall receive the greater Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>The admitting unqualified Perſons into the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, is of dangerous Conſequence to thoſe that authoriſe their Miſſion.</hi> Herein they are acceſſary to their Ruin, for by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting them to be publick Teachers in the Church, they exalt them above Meaſure, and lead them into the <hi>Snare of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> and ſo are chargeable with great Guilt, as is plainly inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated in the forementioned Paſſages; <hi>Lay Hands ſuddenly on no Man, neither be Partaker of other Men's Sins, keep thy ſelf pure,</hi> pure from the Blood of all Men: As if one Way for the Overſeers of the Flocks to keep themſelves pure and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent from Tranſgreſſion is, to uſe proper Caution about filling up the Miniſtry, and ſhutting the Door of Ordination againſt all unqualified Perſons.</p>
            <p>And indeed the encouraging ſuch Novices to undertake the Charge and Care of Souls, argues a great Degree of Unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in the Miniſters of Chriſt, and expoſeth them to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and eccleſiaſtical Cenſure. Moreover, the Souls of ſuch daring Intruders, and the Souls of them that are committed to their Truſt, are greatly endangered by the Unſkilfulneſs of ſuch blind Guides. How then will the Rulers in the Church, who are continually negligent in this Matter, be able to give an Account of their Stewardſhip to the Judge of all? The Blood of Souls may be required of them: Eſpecially the Souls of ſuch <hi>Novices</hi> whom they have been inſtrumental of lifting up with Pride, and ſo delivering unto Satan: For by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring this Honour upon them, they have given them a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Incentive to Luſt, and cannot be innocent.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, by a ſervile Compliance with that <hi>Spirit that luſteth</hi> to Pride and Dominion, Miniſters baſely betray the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Truſt Chriſt has committed to them: And ſuch a licentious Practice is directly contrary to ſacred Canon, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly 2 Tim. 2.2. <hi>The Things that thou haſt heard of me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many Witneſſes, the ſame commit thou to faithful Men, who ſhall be</hi> ABLE TO TEACH OTHERS ALSO.</p>
            <p>Not but that <hi>Novices</hi> may artfully creep into the Church, after all the Precaution and Vigilance of its faithful Paſtors; but then, if their Admiſſion be not owing to the criminal
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005198_0013_1016E1D21DA89B08"/>Neglect of CHRIST'S Miniſters, in examining and proving them, he will not impute it to them for Sin.</p>
            <p>However, what is here pleaded for is, that the Officers of Church, that are concern'd in this important Affair, ſhould be very careful to acquaint themſelves with the good Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thoſe whom they put into the Miniſtry, and not act with an implicit blind Faith in an Affair of CHRIST'S King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, upon which ſo much Good depends.</p>
            <p>Obſerve the <hi>apoſtolick</hi> religious Care with which the <hi>College</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> was filled up, after the Tranſgreſſion and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical End of <hi>Judas the Traitor,</hi> as it is expreſſed in the firſt Chapter of <hi>Acts. Of theſe Men,</hi> ſays <hi>Peter</hi> to the Diſciples, <hi>which have companied with us all the Time that the Lord Jeſus went in and out among us—muſt one be ordained to be a Witneſs with us of his Reſurrection, and they appointed two,—and they prayed, and ſaid, Thou, Lord, which knoweſt the Hearts of all Men, ſhew whether of theſe two thou haſt choſen, that he may take Part of this Miniſtry, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was doubtleſs written for the Direction and Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church in all Ages, and the Paſtors of the Churches ſhould remember how they have received and heard, and hold faſt the <hi>faithful Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>The admitting unqualified Perſons into the Miniſtry, is very dangerous and deſtructive to the Souls of ſuch as are led of them.</hi> This is of very dangerous Tendency to thoſe, to whom they are ſent to miniſter. For not being poſſeſs'd with an awful Senſe of the Worth of Souls, and the Importance of the miniſterial Office, nor influenced by Chriſtian Motives in the Undertaking of it, nor qualified to feed the Church of GOD, the precious Souls of Men will be in utmoſt Haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of periſhing under the Miniſtry of ſuch <hi>Novices.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such are apt to be confident enough that they <hi>themſelves are Guides of the Blind,</hi> and LIGHTS of <hi>them which are in Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> whereas it would be much more ſafe and becoming for them to be jealous of themſelves, and with the moſt ſerious Self-Reflection <hi>take Heed that the</hi> Light <hi>which is in them be not Darkneſs.</hi> Thou which teacheſt another, teacheſt thou not thy ſelf? <hi>Thou blind Pariſee! Thou Hypocrite! Firſt caſt out the Beam out of thine own Eye, and then ſhalt thou ſee clearly to caſt

            </p>
            <p>Sad and dangerous indeed is the State of the Church, when it is ſo forſaken of GOD, as to be left to the Care of unſkilful and unfaithful Guides.

            <p>It is obſervable, that when Chriſt gave his Apoſtles their Commiſſion to go and teach <hi>all Nations,</hi> he directs them <hi>to tarry at Jeruſalem until they were endued with Power from on High;</hi> 'till they received their Credentials, in the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Gifts of Tongues and Miracles, which, we read in the <hi>ſecond Chapter of Acts,</hi> were gloriouſly beſtowed on them, to qualify them for ſuch an extraordinary Miſſion, as goſpelizing the whole World.</p>

The Apoſtles of our Lord have been very careful to give the Churches of Chriſt all the neceſſary Qualifications of good Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, that they may be furniſhed at all Times with able and faithful Paſtors, and ſo be kept pure from a corrupt and bad Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>Indeed, whoſoever has a juſt Apprehenſion of the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Difficulty and Importance of the evangelical Miniſtry, needeth not Arguments to convince him of the Neceſſity of encouraging and ſupporting learned and godly Paſtors in the Churches. It is therefore owing to Ignorance, Pride, and Want of Conſideration and Judgment, that any think and ſpeak contrarywiſe, That Men of mean Abilities and Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in Knowledge, are able to preach the <hi>unſearchable Riches</hi> of Chriſt, open the great Myſteries of Godlineſs, and defend the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Alas! It requires no ſmall Compaſs of Reaſon and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be able to preach and defend the Goſpel; for Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are ſet to defend, as well as preach the everlaſting Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: And if Need be, they muſt <hi>contend earneſtly for the Faith, which was once delivered to the Saints. The Servant of the Lord muſt alſo be patient, in Meekneſs inſtructing thoſe that oppoſe themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is alſo required of a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> That <hi>he hold faſt the faithful Word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by ſound Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine both to exhort, and convince the Gainſayers (for there are many unruly and vain Talkers and Deceivers,</hi> as in the Apoſtles Days, ſo in all Ages of the Church, whoſe <hi>Mouths muſt be ſtopped; who ſubvert whole Houſes, teaching Things which they ought not for filthy Lucres Sake);<note n="†" place="bottom">1 <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.9, 10, 11.</note> In Doctrine ſhewing Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptneſs, Gravity, Sincerity, ſound Speech that cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, that he that is of the contrary Part, may be aſhamed.</hi>

            <p>But how ſhall they, that are <hi>ignorant</hi> and <hi>unlearned,</hi> be able to do this? To convince Gainſayers, and defend the great Myſteries and Truths of the Goſpel, againſt the <hi>cunning Craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs</hi> of them that lie in Wait to deceive?

            <p>For GOD'S Sake, <hi>Brethren,</hi> what would have become of the Chriſtian Religion long ago, had it not been for the wiſe and learned Defenders of it againſt its ableſt Adverſaries?

            </p>
            <p>God has raiſed up able Advocates and Apologiſts to eſpouſe and defend his own Cauſe from Age to Age, who have been <hi>valiant for the Truth,</hi> and quitted themſelves like Men in the Cauſe of God, ſo that Truth has not <hi>fallen in the Streets,</hi> but ſtill prevails in the Earth.</p>
            <p>And indeed the Revival of Learning, ſince the glorious Reformation, has been a great Elucidation and Eſtabliſhment of the Truths of our holy Religion: So that the Enemies of good Literature are Enemies to the true Intereſt of Chriſtianity, whether they know it or not.</p>
            <p>It has been publickly obſerved, that the Intereſt of Religion and good Literature, have been wont to riſe and fall toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Wherefore ſay <hi>our Fathers,</hi>

            <p>Alas! How ſoon would the Church of God be laid deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, if the Hedge of a learned, able and faithful Miniſtry, which Chriſt hath ſet about it, were once taken down. Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, Error, Hereſy, Superſtition, Confuſion and every evil Work, would ſoon cover the Face of the Vineyard of the Lord of Hoſts. It would quickly be over-grown with Thorns, and Nettles cover the Face thereof, when the Wall thereof is broken down. With ſuch awful Severity and Judgment, God threatens the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for their Unfruitfulneſs under his moſt gracious Cultivations in Iſa. 5.5, 6. <hi>And now—I will tell you what I will do to my Vineyard, I will take away the Hedge thereof, and it ſhall be eaten up, and break down the Wall

            <p>How is it poſſible for a <hi>Novice</hi> to magnify his Office, and recommend Religion to the Eſteem and Practice of Men? <hi>He that teacheth Man Knowledge ſhould not he know?

            </p>
            <p>Moreover, the ſetting up and ſending forth ſuch Teachers in the Church of Chriſt, is the great Reproach to Chriſtianity, and the direct Way to promote <hi>the Contempt of the Clergy,</hi> than which a greater Injury can ſcarce be offered to the true intereſt of Religion.</p>
            <p>Thus I have finiſhed the <hi>doctrinal Part of my Subject,</hi> and ſhall now cloſe it with ſeveral uſeful Reflections.—</p>

For to this End, Chriſt was pleaſed to raiſe up a Succeſſion of <hi>inſpired Prophets and Teachers in the Jewiſh Church,</hi> and <hi>at ſundry Times, and in divers Manners, ſpake unto the Fathers by them.</hi> In the Fulneſs of Time, he manifeſted himſelf to Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, full of Grace and Truth, as the <hi>Lord who teacheth us to Profit,</hi> as the great Teacher of the Church, <hi>who ſpake as never Man ſpake.</hi> When he had finiſhed the Work of GOD, and aſcended up on High, he gave Gifts unto Men, <hi>Some Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Paſtors and Teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the Work of the Miniſtry, for the edifying of the Body of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, the Higheſt himſelf has eſtabliſhed the Security and Safety of the Church in Oppoſition to the confederated Powers of Earth and Hell, in that glorious Promiſe, <hi>That the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it.</hi>

            <p>How beautiful and ſafe is the Church in the Favour and Protection of the Almighty, under all the Imperfection that cleaves to his Miniſters and Members in this militant State? This is our Hope, and this our Confidence, that <hi>God will help her, and that right early.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>For any of the Miniſters of Chriſt then, to give their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentials to unworthy Men, is to act directly in the Face of Scripture Canons, and betray the Cauſe of Chriſt.

I would uſe here great Plainneſs of Speech, for I apprehend the Caſe requires it, and freely ſay, that I can't ſee how Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters can anſwer to GOD and their own Conſciences, their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting raw, indiſcreeit, raſh, illiterate and blind NOVICES into their Pulpits, and commending them to theſe Churches, as uſeful Inſtruments of carrying on the Work of GOD, as hath been the Manner of ſome more lately.<note n="†" place="bottom">I leave it to thoſe Reverend Gentleman, who ſigned the <hi>Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Aſſembly of Paſtors in July laſt,</hi> to reconcile their own Conduct with the Advice therein given, in this very In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance (among others) viz. <q>That Miniſters do not encourage <hi>raw</hi> and <hi>indiſcreet</hi> young <hi>Candidates</hi> in ruſhing into parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Places, and preaching publickly or privately, as ſome have done to the no ſmall Diſrepute and Damage of the Work where it once promiſed to flouriſh.</q>

            <p>It is to be feared, that there has been too much Indifference and Coldneſs among the <hi>Clergy of New-England,</hi> as well as elſewhere, in this important Article, of <hi>examining and introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Candidates</hi> into the Miniſtry; eſpecially, in the Years laſt paſt, has the <hi>ſacred Ministry</hi> been laid too <hi>common,</hi> as if it were not a <hi>ſacred Encloſure,</hi> and any bold Intruder might take <hi>this Honour to himſelf,</hi> without <hi>due Qualifications,</hi> or a <hi>regular Call;</hi> which in the Nature of Things bodes very Ill to the Church of Chriſt: Whereas the Scripture ſaith, <hi>No Man taketh this Honour unto himſelf, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.</hi>

            <p>But to the Praiſe of the Government of this <hi>Colony,</hi> be it ſpoken, that they have expreſſed an examplary Care in this Matter of introducing <hi>Candicates</hi> into the holy Miniſtry, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all the <hi>Provinces in New-England:</hi> And it is doubtleſs a great Part of the Beauty and Strength of your good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.

            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, This Doctrine alſo admoniſheth the Churches of Chriſt, to take Heed of committing their Souls to the Care of unſkilful Novices.</hi> For hereby the Souls of Men are expoſed to eternal Ruin. Who then in his Wits would be careleſs and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the Choice of a Guide and Paſtor to his Soul? There is ſurely no Affair in the whole Circle of Life that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires more ſerious Care and aſſiduous Prayer, than this of chooſing able, faithful, ſkilful Guides for our Souls. And as Chriſt has given theſe Churches Power of chooſing their own Paſtors, ſo let them be exhorted to <hi>ſtand faſt in the Liberty</hi> wherewith he hath made them free, and not abuſe it in a criminal Manner.</p>
            <p>Let the Churches be adviſed to act with prudent Care and Caution in the Exerciſe of this Power.

            <p>Yet ſtrange it is, that ſo many, in theſe Days, apprehend themſelves well qualified for the miniſterial Office without Learning, or Study, or any Qualification for this good Work; except Ignorance, and Confidence may be accounted ſuch.

               <q>There are ſome <hi>Stars of Light</hi> that have their Orbits quite croſs the Spheres of the Earth, and all the other Planets, ſuch as <hi>Comets,</hi> or <hi>blazing Stars;</hi> but theſe are ſuch, as are extremely heated, and ſet into a Blaze; and have been look'd upon as omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Appearances, and whatever Uſe God may make of them, for the Benefit of thoſe Globes whoſe Spheres they croſs;—yet it may be ſaid, that the State they are ſuppoſed to be in, and the Manner of their Motion is such, that they give a moſt dreadful Shock to ſome Globe, that ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to come in their Way.—So that there is no Argument from <hi>Comets</hi> for Miniſters to ſet up for <hi>wandring Stars;</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed GOD may, and does bring Good out of ſuch Things, but for Men (without any plain Call) to go from Place to Place, entering into other Men's Charges, and croſſing their Spheres, I think, is very ominous to the Church of Chriſt, and threatens their <hi>Peace,</hi> their <hi>Purity</hi> and their <hi>Order</hi> exceedingly.—We know what Kind of Angels they were that <hi>kept not their firſt Eſtate, but left their own Habitation.</hi>

               <q>Biſhop <hi>Burnet,</hi> in his <hi>Preface</hi> to the <hi>paſtoral Care,</hi> repreſerits the daring Boldneſs of many Intruders into it, in a moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting Manner. <hi>Says he,</hi> Our <hi>ember Weeks</hi> are the Burden and Grief of my Life. The much greater Part of thoſe who come to be ordained are ignorant to a Degree, not to be apprehended by thoſe who are not obliged to know it. The eaſieſt Strangers, I mean the plaineſt Parts of the Scriptures. They cry and think it a ſaid Diſgrace to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied Orders, though the Ignorance of ſome of them is ſuch, that in a well regulated State of Things they would appear not knowing enough to be admitted to the holy Sacrament.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>This, <hi>ſays he,</hi> doth of ten tear my Heart.—Theſe Things pierce one's Soul, and make him often cry out, Oh that I had Wings like a Dove, for then would I fly away and be at Reſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>He obſerves further,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Burnet's paſtoral Care. <hi>P. 50.</hi>
               </note> 
               <q>It were indeed happy for the Church, if thoſe who offer themſelves to Orders had but ſuch a
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:005198_0026_1016E21219811D20"/>Senſe of them as Tradeſman have of their Freedom; who do not pretend to it, 'till they have finiſhed the Time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, and are in ſome Sort qualified to ſet up in it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Whereas alas! Men who neither know the Scriptures, nor the Body of Divinity, who have made no Progreſs in their Studies, and can give no tolerable Account of that holy Doctrine, in which they deſire to be Teachers, do yet, with equal Degrees of Confidence and Importunity, pretend to this Character, and find the Way to it too eaſy, and the Acceſs to it too free.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>This Doctrine may alſo ſerve to admoniſh all young unexperienced Converts to take Heed to themſelves, watch and be ſober; leſt being lifted up with Pride, they come into Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> GOD reſiſteth the Proud, but he giveth Grace unto the Humble. Be cloathed with Humility. Learn of Chriſt who was meek &amp; lowly in Heart, &amp; has laid Humility in the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of his heavenly Doctrine. <hi>Bleſſed are the poor in Spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.3.</note> I ſay to every Man that is among you, not to think of himſelf more highly than he ought to think, but to think ſoberly. This will be the beſt Antidote againſt many Irregularities and Scandals that prevail in the preſent Times, and even among many of the thoſe, who have been the Subjects of the late religious Commotion in the Land. <hi>Particularly,</hi> a Spirit of raſh, cenſorious Judging which is gone forth, and rages in the Country? than which nothing can be more contrary to the Spirit of Chriſt and his Goſpel.</p>
            <p>It is a juſt Obſervation of <hi>one<note n="‖" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Chauncy,</hi> &amp;c. P. 169.</note> who has Underſtanding in the Times; ſays he,</hi> 
               <q>I ſhall not exceed the literal Truth, when I ſay, that there never was a Time; ſince the Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of <hi>New-England,</hi> wherein there were ſo much bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and raſh Judging: And what may be worth a Note, the Places where this Appearance has been moſt remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, have commonly been moſt filled with Uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in all the Expreſſions of it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>It would be endleſs to reckon up the monſtrous Sayings which many who call themſelves, the Converts of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:005198_0027_1016E1E47B29F348"/>Times, have uttered; eſpecially againſt ſome of the moſt valuable Miniſters in the Country, out of a Spirit of meer Jealouſy.</q>
            </p>
            <p>If theſe Perſons are Chriſtians indeed, then there may be Chriſtianity without Charity, contrary to the Apoſtle's expreſs Declaration, <hi>If I have no Charity I am nothing. If any Man among you ſeem to be religious, and bridleth not his Tongue—this Man's Religion is vain.</hi>

                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.26.</note> If ſuch Perſons have performed the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of the Lord, what meaneth then this <hi>Bleating of the Sheep in our Ears, and the lowing of the Oxen which we hear?</hi> So much Clamour and evil Speaking among high Professors?</p>
            <p>Nay, my Brethren, this is not a vain and trivial Matter, it ought not to be paſſed over with ſuch a gentle Rebuke as the Manner of ſome is, in the cold Language of <hi>Eli to his wicked Sons, Why do ye ſuch Things? Nay, my Sons, for it is no good Report that I hear.</hi> But it was a very bad one, and ſuch an Antichriſtian Spirit of raſh Judging ought to be <hi>rebuked ſharply.</hi> For the great Founder of our holy Religion has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſaid, <hi>Judge not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now from whence comes ſuch a Spirit of raſh Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Cometh it not hence, even of this Luſt of Pride? And ſuch as indulge it are in Danger of <hi>falling into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of the Devil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There has been, of late, much Talk about Religion, and a remarkable Work of GOD in the Country; but it muſt be remembred, that the <hi>Kingdom of GOD is not in Word but in Power:</hi> And, for my own Part, I have been waiting to ſee the Work prove it ſelf in the <hi>Power of Godlineſs,</hi> and the <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Fruits of the Spirit of GOD, in all Goodneſs, Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But indeed the unwearied Pains taken by the Friends of the late religious Commotion among us, to perſwade People, that GOD has <hi>remerkably revived his Work</hi> in the Land, is ſo far from being a Confirmation of it, that, in my Opinion, 'tis more apt to bring a Suſpicion upon it.</p>
            <p>If there be ſuch a happy <hi>Revival of GOD'S Work,</hi> as ſome <hi>contend earneſtly for,</hi> what Need of <hi>calling of Aſſemblies,</hi> and
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:005198_0028_1016E214F689E618"/>ſo much <hi>Preaching and Writing</hi> to poſſeſs the Minds of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with the Belief of it? For the <hi>Work of GOD</hi> will prove itſelf, by producing a viſible and glorious Reformation among the happy Subjects of it, which the <hi>Lord haſten in his Time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, <hi>Let the Miniſters of Chriſt conſider what Reaſon they have to be humbled for the Remainder of Pride in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though the Work of the Miniſtry be attended with many humbling Circumſtances and preſſing Difficulties, particularly at this Time; yet have our Hearts, dear Brethren, been truly humbled to this Day? Are we clothed with Humility down to the Foot? Has not Pride, that Root of Bitterneſs, been ſpringing and operating in us to our Shame? Is not Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge apt to puff us up, and make us Superſtitious and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious? Ready to lord it over GOD'S Heritage, and make us Buſy-bodies in other Men's Matters, or Biſhops in another Man's Dioceſs?</p>
            <p>Doth not the empty Applauſe of Men, ſerve to exalt us above Meaſure, and feed the Pride and Vanity of our Minds.</p>
            <p>Are we not too apt to ſpend our precious Time in vain Diſputes and Wranglings, inſtead of ſtudying to profit the Souls of our People both in Word and Doctrine.</p>
            <p>Are we patient and penitent when we hear the Defaming of many? Oh let us examine ourſelves, and labour to keep under and ſubdue this dangerous Luſt, <hi>Leſt that by any Means when we have preached to others, we ourſelves ſhould be Caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aways.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude with a ſerious Addreſs, <hi>Firſt,</hi> To my Rev. and dear <hi>Brother,</hi> whoſe Conſecration to God, in the Goſpel of his Son, we are now attending. <hi>Secondly,</hi> To the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>People of God in this Place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Dear Sir,</hi> Suffer the Exhortation that ſpeaketh to you, as to a <hi>Son and Candidate for holy Orders.</hi> You have heard ſomething of the great and neceſſary Qualifications of a good Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, and the Danger of admitting unqualified perſons to take Part of this Miniſtry; and I doubt not, but that your Heart is in ſome good Meaſure affected with the Senſe of the Difficulty and Importance of the Work upon which you are entring.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:005198_0029_1016E1E969C80F68"/>
I have known your <hi>Education, Principles</hi> and <hi>Manner of Life</hi> from your Youth up, and have had a good Taſte of your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial Gifts and Accompliſhments, all which, in my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are ſo many deſirable Qualifications to <hi>perfect you for the Work of the Miniſtry,</hi> for <hi>the edifying of the Body of Chriſt.</hi> Theſe Things, being in you and abounding, both free <hi>you from the Imputation of a Novice, and us from the Guilt of puting ſuch an one into the Miniſtry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But yet, there is Room for Growth; you muſt Labour to increaſe in Wiſdom and he moſt uſeful Learning; but above all Things, <hi>grow in Grace and in the Knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> My <hi>Son,</hi> be ſtrong <hi>in the Grace</hi> that is in Chriſt Jeſus. To this End give Attendance to Reading, to Exhortation, to Doctrine, meditate upon theſe Thing, give thy Self wholly to them, that thy profiting may appear to all, <hi>and in all Things.</hi> Study to ſhew thy Self approved unto God a Workman that needeth not to be aſhamed, <hi>rightly dividing the Word of Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do this Day, with ſacred Freedom and Pleaſure, act the Part you have devolved upon me; (however unequal to it) and in Concurrence with other Paſtors and Churches conven'd on this ſolemn Occaſion, join Heart and Hand in ſeperating you to the Goſpel of God. We bring you, <hi>Dear Sir,</hi> to this People, and bleſs you in the Name of the Lord; may the <hi>Lord bleſs you out of Zion, and have Reſpect unto your Offering!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You enter <hi>Sir,</hi> upon the Work of the Miniſtry, in a dark and difficult Time, wherein you will find uncommon Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to Unfaithfulneſs; But be of good Courage, and let none of theſe Thing move you. Do the Work of a good Miniſter of Chriſt, will all Fidelity; and be valiant for the Truth.</p>
            <p>And as my Subject leads me to give you this Caution, ſo I would do it both for your own Safety, and the Safety of pure and undefiled Religion: That is, guard your Pulpit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt every <hi>Novice;</hi> exclude, if poſſible, all unqualified Perſons from the miniſterial Office, <hi>Lay Hands ſuddenly on</hi> no <hi>Man; be not Partakers of other Men's Sins, keep thy ſelf pure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, take heed unto thyſelf, and unto thy Doctrine, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in them, for in ſo doing this, thou ſhalt both ſave thy ſelf, and them that hear thee.</p>

In the Second Place, <hi>I turn and addreſs my ſelf to the Church and People of God in this Place.</hi> Holy <hi>Brethren,</hi> Partakers of the heavenly Calling, we congratulate you this Day upon the wiſe Choice, that the glorious Head of the Church has directed you to make of a <hi>Pastor,</hi> whom we truſt is after his own Heart, who ſhall feed you <hi>with Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Underſtanding,</hi> and ſo fill up the Breach he has made upon you in the Deceaſe of your late faithful and pious Paſtor.<note n="*" place="bottom">Rev.
