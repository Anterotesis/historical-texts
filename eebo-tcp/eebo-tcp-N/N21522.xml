            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>AS the deſign of the author of the following pages, is to ſolicit attention to the proofs in favour of Chriſtianity, and not to recommend his own peculiar ideas of it, he has endeavoured, as far as the ſubject will admit, to guard againſt thruſting forward his own private opinions. What this man believes, or that, is nothing to an enquirer after religious truth. The fountain is open, and whoſoever will may come, and take of the water of life freely. He is a kind neighbour who directs the ſtranger, and aſſiſts the weak; but he who would intrude upon another the water of his pitcher, be it pure or polluted, ſeeks to beguile him of his right, and honours himſelf more than he ought.</p>
            <p>The plan of the following Addreſs was ſtruck out, and partly executed, before the author ſaw the Letters which Dr. Prieſtley has lately ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to the Jews. He thought whether that publication might not render this unneceſſary: but on peruſal, imagined that what was projected might ſtill have its uſe; and as ſome others have joined in the ſame opinion, this is an additional motive (conſcious as he is of his deficiencies) to offer it to the Public, hoping that candour will paſs over thoſe defects, which greater experience may diſcover; and praying that the bleſſing of God may make it the means of promoting Truth and Righteouſneſs.</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>YE children of Abraham, and of the covenant which God made with your fathers, permit a ſtranger affectionately to ſolicit your attention to matters of the higheſt concern both to you and the Gentile nations.</p>
            <p>Long has been the captivity, and ſore the afflictions which your tribes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ve endured. Surely then it is time to awake to ſerious conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and to enquire wherefore it is that the anger of God againſt you ſtill endures. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs there is a cauſe which bears a juſt proportion to your ſufferings; for the Lord doth not afflict willingly the children of men.<note n="*" place="bottom">Lam. iii. 23.</note>
            </p>
            <p>As Aſſyria of old was the rod in God's hand to chaſtiſe your fathers, till they ſhould acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their tranſgreſſions, and turn to him; ſo the more modern nations (though the ſin of their conduct is not hereby extenuated) have been the inſtruments of inflicting upon you the divine diſpleaſure. The folly and the wrath of man has been made to praiſe the righteous go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of God. Great indeed have been the evils which you have endured from the ſeveral nations, Heathen, Mahometan, and Chriſtian: and though, in general, they have now adopted maxims of government more humane, and your
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:028290_0005_0FD87E3843CA7198"/>ſufferings are in a meaſure abated (which, it may be hoped, is the prelude of your deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and the token of God's returning mercy) yet your captivity continues, and Jeruſalem is trodden down of the Gentiles. But where is the humiliation and deep repentance, which, according to the prophets, ſhall be the forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of your deliverance, and which God ſhall reward with ſuch manifeſtations of his favour as no nation has ever experienced? Are not the moſt thinking among you conſtrained to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that your repentance is not more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, and that you apply yourſelves with no more ſeriouſneſs to enquire the cauſe of God's anger? Was not the illumined eye of prophecy directed towards your tribes, to obſerve your conduct in theſe laſt days, when the prophet ſaid, <q>The Lord hath poured upon him the f ury of his anger, and the ſtrength of battle; and it hath ſet him on fire round about, yet he knew it not; and it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>What was the covenant which God made with your fathers? To Abraham he promiſed, <q>I will be a God unto thee, and to thy ſeed after thee: and I will give unto thee, and to thy ſeed after thee, the land wherein thou art a ſtranger, all the land of Canaan for an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting poſſeſſion; and I will be their God<note n="†" place="bottom">Gen. xvii. 7.8.</note>
               </q> By Moſes he ſaid, <q>If thou ſhalt hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to obſerve and to do all his commandments which I command thee this day; the Lord thy God will ſet thee on high above all nations of the earth. But it ſhall come to paſs if thou wilt not hearken, that all theſe curſes ſhall come upon thee; curſed ſhalt thou be in the city, and curſed ſhalt thou
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:028290_0006_0FD8811C9BF48E20"/>be in the field. And the Lord ſhall ſcatter thee among all people, from one end of the earth even unto the other.—And it ſhall come to paſs when all theſe things are come upon thee, and thou ſhalt call them to mind among all the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions whither the Lord thy God hath driven thee, and ſhalt return unto the Lord thy God, and ſhalt obey his voice, then the Lord thy God will turn thy captivity, and have compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon thee<note n="*" place="bottom">Deut. xxviii. 1, 15, 16, 64.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ath not heard your groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as he did thoſe of your fathers in Egypt, and remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Iſaac, and with Jacob: for be aſſured he is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to his promiſe, and no length of time can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validate his covenant. He is waiting that he may be gracious, and that he may have mercy upon you<note n="†" place="bottom">Iſa. xxx. 18.</note>.</p>
            <p>Your preſent diſperſion, and that hope which the promiſes of God give you of <hi>temporal</hi> proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, when you ſhall repent and ſeek the Lord with your whole heart, are motives to induce you to ſearch and ſee what thoſe ſins are which have brought upon you ſuch unparalleled marks of the divine diſpleaſure, and which prevent the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:028290_0007_0FD8811DEDAE2B08"/>of the promiſes; but <hi>that guilt</hi> which ſin unrepented of brings upon the ſoul, and thoſe <hi>unſpeakable evils</hi> to which it expoſes you in the world to come, preſent to you ſtill ſtronger mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to apply yourſelves to this work. Thoſe temporal ſufferings which may be endured in this life, are but the ſhadow of that diſpleaſure which purſues the guilty into the world of ſpirits. To ſay the leaſt, it is highly probable that you have not yet diſcovered the principal cauſe of God's anger, and conſequently have not acknowledged it before him: had you done ſo, we may be ſure that the merciful and faithful God would long ere this have turned your captivity, and have had mercy upon you. Enquire therefore why your God ſo long contendeth with you.</p>
            <p>Whether the Chriſtian religion (not as held forth in the creeds of erring men, but as contained in our ſacred ſcriptures) be from God or of man, is ſurely worthy of attentive examination. What I would requeſt of you is, not to condemn what you have never examined, but to beſtow upon the ſubject that ſerious and unbiaſſed attention, which both its own nature and your peculiar cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances demand.</p>
            <p>Seeing that your preſent captivity was foretold by him whom Chriſtians acknowledge as the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah<note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. xxi. 33—44. xxiii. 34—39. xxiv.</note>; ſeeing that it took place from the days he announced; examine whether it be not for reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, and continuing in oppoſition to his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. At leaſt, it is worth the trouble of enquiry. And the more ſo, as our ſacred ſcriptures<note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. xi.</note>, while they declare your temporary rejection to be for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief hold forth promiſes of your reſtoration when you ſhall repent and believe. When this event ſhall take place, the prophecies in our ſcriptures declare, that then ſhall be accompliſhed the glorious things
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:028290_0008_0FD8811F33A21BF0"/>foretold in yours. Your rejection till ſuch an event being thus affirmed, when no human fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight could poſſibly diſcover it; and all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, even to the preſent diſtant day, inſtead of at all diſcrediting the prophecy, uniting to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſh its authenticity; ſhould, to ſay the leaſt, induce you, as reaſonable men, ſo far to lay aſide your prejudice, as to enquire ſeriouſly whether your fathers may not have fallen into an error, and whether there may not be more evidence for the truth of Chriſtianity than you have hitherto been willing to think. Seeing that the prediction reſpecting your rejection is verified, it is, at leaſt, ſuch a preſumption in favour of the inſpiration of the promiſe of grace, when you ſhall believe, as ſhould incline you to a candid enquiry: and I ſhall endeavour to ſhew, by and by, that your own prophets have predicted the ſame thing.</p>
            <p>And are there not many other reaſons, which ought to induce you to examine this matter with the greateſt attention? Such as that general ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the Meſſiah which prevailed about ſeventeen or eighteen hundred years ago, and which has prevailed more or leſs ever ſince; from whence many pretenders have ſet up for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected deliverer; and who have been followed, till their impoſture has been made manifeſt. And what is recorded of your Rabbi Elias, who lived about two hundred years before the appearance of Jeſus, is an argument in favour of that enquiry which I would urge upon you. He ſaid (no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from whence he derived his intelligence) he ſaid the world was to ſtand ſix thouſand years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the great ſabbath, two thouſand before the law, two thouſand under the law, and two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand under the Meſſiah. The laſt two thouſand are nearly gone, and no Meſſiah hath appeared, if Jeſus be not he; if he be, then we ſee (thus
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:028290_0009_0FD88120B0AE1CC8"/>far) the accompliſhment of this prediction; and the cleareſt light is thrown upon many of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies; ſuch as the ſeventy weeks of Daniel, the glory of the ſecond temple, &amp;c. If Jeſus be the Chriſt, then theſe two thouſand years are employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the enlightening of the Gentiles, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling the other prophecies. And though Iſrael, for the ſin of rejecting him, has been in bondage theſe ſeventeen hundred years, yet this does not diſcourage us from hoping in the promiſes, Ye ſhall be gathered, before the conſummation of all things, to the feet of the Meſſiah, and he ſhall be your King to ſave you. Yes, we may hope that his favour, as the light, in breaking upon you, and that the day is not very far off, when the voice of mercy ſhall ſay, <q>Awake and ſing ye that dwell in the duſt, for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth ſhall caſt out the dead<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſa. xxvi. 19.</note>.</q>—But however this may be, all theſe things put together form a powerful argument to induce you to an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive examination.</p>
            <p>It muſt be owned, to the reproach of profeſſing Chriſtians, that through the impiety of their lives, their corruptions of the Chriſtian doctrine, their intolerance towards each other, and their perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions of your nation, they have contributed not a little towards perpetuating your abhorrence of their profeſſion; yet, ſeeing theſe are not the teſt of the truth or falſehood of our ſcriptures, any more than the idolatry and other bad practices of your forefathers were of the truth or falſehood of the laws of Moſes; you are not hereby juſtified in continuing to reject Jeſus as the Meſſiah, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out examining the proofs which lie before you. If you have no better reaſons for rejecting Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity than thoſe derived from the practices of profeſſing Chriſtians, you might as well reject re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in every form, and deny that God ever ſpoke
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:028290_0010_0FD881222A2B6CE8"/>to man—to the law and to the teſtimony. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare our ſcriptures with yours; try the matter by the ſevereſt rules; ſee with your own eyes; judge with your own underſtandings; and then ſay, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſpaſſionate enquiry, whether the religion of Jeſus bears thoſe marks of impoſture which you have been uſed to think it does.</p>
            <p>Free and unbiaſſed enquiry is the glory of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature. To be a Heathen, a Jew, or a Chriſtian, becauſe our fathers were ſo, is unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming any reaſonable creature, arrived at years of underſtanding. That man is of no religion whoſe profeſſion is not from conviction, and there can be no conviction but from enquiry. He who grounds his faith on the authority of others, and then ſtudies only for confirmation, ſeeks not truth by the light of truth, and is therefore ever liable to embrace falſehood; and ſhould he be ſo very fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate as to embrace truth, in him it is no virtue.— Riſe, then, O man, who art created after the image of thy God; ſeek truth, and thou ſhalt find her; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake her not, and ſhe ſhall preſerve thee; love her, and ſhe ſhall keep thee.</p>
            <p>But, what is neceſſary to a fair enquiry after truth? What is indiſpenſable to your inveſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſtianity, that you may form the concluſion of virtuous men, and know whether it be of God or no? Humility, candour, a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate temper, the love of truth, and the love of God. Do theſe guide and warm your hearts? Come, then; Religion riſes to meet you; her books are open.</p>
            <p>No man in this enquiry (if he bring with him a heart rightly diſpoſed) need deſpair of finding the good and right way; for ſurely that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which comes from God, carries with it an evidence which is diſcernible by the moſt ſimple and unlettered, whoſe minds are not corrupted
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028290_0011_0FD88122DFB18A68"/>by vice, or warped by prejudice. But let all, while they attend to that evidence which is held forth in the Jewiſh and Chriſtian ſcriptures, ſeek to God, by earneſt ſupplications, for his ſpirit to teach them to profit, and to lead them by the way they ſhould go<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſa. xlviii. 17.</note>: For that heart which is unſeaſoned with the ſalt of grace, and a ſtranger to ſerious devotion, is utterly unfit for the enquiry before us.</p>
            <p>The firſt requiſite (next to a devout ſpirit) to a right enquiry after truth, is <hi>humility.</hi> We muſt ever deſpair of that man's errors being rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, who is ſo confident that he is right, that he will give no ear to any thing which oppoſes his opinions; nor allow any force in arguments, however cogent, which may tend to ſhake the foundation on which his ſyſtem is built. When any pretender to religion has adopted certain articles of faith, and laid them down as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable truths, and will not allow of his liability to miſtake; nor attend to any reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or proofs, which go to ſhow him his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; <hi>his</hi> mind is in a ſtate the moſt unfit for the diſcovery of truth.</p>
            <p>Would you examine the evidence for, and againſt, the Chriſtian religion, with that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of mind which the caſe deſerves, you muſt think of thoſe articles of your faith, which you have been uſed to lay down as unqueſtionable truths (ſuch, for inſtance, as relate to a ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Meſſiah) with that humbleneſs of mind, which becomes men liable to err. Where is the man who is ſo enlightened as to be able to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate through all the darkneſs which hangs over many of the prophecies, eſpecially before their fulfilment? For we are to remember, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, in general, is not meant as hiſtory, to give us clear and ſpecific ideas of the perſons or
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:028290_0012_0FD8812971C4FB68"/>things ſpoken of. Here, no more is revealed than is neceſſary to encourage the hopes of God's ſervants, and identify the perſons and things when they appear; and thus bear witneſs to the truth of God's word. The general contents of a prophecy may be very intelligible, yet the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of it to time and perſons may be very uncertain. There muſt be obſcurity in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, as well as ſhade in a picture; all its lines muſt not ſtand in a full light; for if the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies were open and barefaced as to all their parts and circumſtances, they would obſtruct the courſe of human affairs, and hinder, if it were poſſible, their own accompliſhment. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty and ſobriety are in all things commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but in nothing more than in the explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe ſacred myſteries. Surely a man muſt read but little, and think leſs, who does not feel himſelf conſtrained to acknowledge that many of the prophecies are hard to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. No man of humility, while he ſtands on the brink of this vaſt abyſs, but muſt hide his face and cry, <q>O the depth of the riches both of the wiſdom and knowledge of God! How unſearchable are his judgments, and his ways paſt finding out! Who hath known the mind of the Lord, or who hath been his counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor?</q> —It is not for any man to ſay, when God promiſes a Saviour to the world (for to the race of Adam he was promiſed before the call of Abraham, or the promiſe that he ſhould be of his ſeed; as well as after by the mouth of the holy Prophets, who announced him as the light of the Gentiles, as well as the Redeemer of Iſrael) it is not for any man to ſay, when God promiſes a Saviour to the world, under what character, or variety of characters, he is to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, till God himſelf makes it known. His
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:028290_0013_0FD8812BC5AF2F58"/>appearance may be the reverſe of that which hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man wiſdom ſuggeſts: for the wiſdom of men is fooliſhneſs with God. But by the prophecies, (hard as many of them are to be underſtood, eſpecially before their fulfilment throws light upon them) God has made known to his church the characters which his Anointed is to ſuſtain. But a teachable humility is an indiſpenſable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to a right underſtanding of them.</p>
            <p>If any man ſay, "My ſentiments of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah's character are certainly right, and muſt not for a moment be called in queſtion;" then, in this caſe, whatever the Prophets may teach, muſt bend to preconceived opinion, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever great the violence. This ſtate of mind is the moſt oppoſite to fair enquiry; and he who is in an error, muſt be in an error ſtill. Nothing can ſave him. The preaching of an archangel would not illuminate his mind.</p>
            <p>But, do you feel thoſe impreſſions of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which teach you to be diffident where there is a poſſibility of erring? Is your heart diſpoſed to bow implicitly to the Revelation of God, without regard to preconceived opinion? Is any man amongſt you praying, <q>O Lord, who can underſtand his errors? Cleanſe thou me from ſecret faults. As a ſinful man, I am prone to err, and ever in danger from the deceptions of prejudice.—Thy counſels, O Lord, are a great deep. As a child, I beſeech thy Spirit to inſtruct me. That which I know not teach thou me, and I will keep it unto the end.</q> Furniſhed with theſe diſpoſitions of mind, truth is not far from you. Seek, and ye ſhall find.</p>
            <p>And need I intreat the wiſe to lay aſide that <hi>national pride</hi> and <hi>prejudice</hi> which puts men up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on juſtifying whatever their anceſtors may have done? Need I intreat you to do all you can to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:028290_0014_0FD87E26EA80D818"/>diveſting yourſelves of that extravagant opinion which all men are too apt to entertain of thoſe who have appeared in favour of their own ſentiments, to the utter neglect and contempt of all ſuch as may have appeared on the oppoſite ſide; as if with theſe there could be neither wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom nor virtue? This prejudice muſt be ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed to the love of truth, or you are never likely to find it.</p>
            <p>Conſider; was it an impoſſible, or even an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable thing, that that generation of men, among whom Jeſus appeared, ſhould be ſo blind and wicked as to perſecute and crucify the true Meſſiah, ſhould God, in his inſcrutable provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, permit them ſo to do, as he did their fathers to perſecute and ſlay the holy Prophets? And where is the man amongſt you who can ſay, <q>I am ſo enlightened into the counſels of God, I have ſuch a certain underſtanding of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, that I know it is not fit for God to permit ſuch an event; I know that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, covered with darkneſs as many of them are, allow of nothing like it.</q> Is ſuch man to be found? Surely not.— <q>Who can by ſearching find out God<note n="*" place="bottom">Job xi. 7.</note>?—My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, ſaith the Lord<note n="†" place="bottom">Iſa. lv. 8.</note>

            </p>
            <p>According to your own hiſtorian, Joſephus, that generation was the moſt wicked that ever exiſted amongſt men. He repreſents the leaders of the people, and even the chief prieſts, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate wretches, who had purchaſed their places by bribes, or ſome other acts of iniquity; and who maintained their ill acquired authority by the moſt flagitious and abominable crimes. Theſe rulers he repreſents as diſſolute and abandoned to the laſt degree; while the multitude, ſet on by theſe corrupt examples, ran headlong into
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:028290_0015_0FD87E27DDE03950"/>every ſort of iniquity, and by their endleſs ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, robberies and extortions, armed againſt them both the juſtice of God and the vengeance of man.</p>
            <p>And with all this deſperate wickedneſs, which deformed their character, were they fond of the moſt idle and ſuperſtitious fancies, and ſtrongly poſſeſſed of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If God, then, whoſe thoughts are not as man's thoughts, and whoſe ways are paſt finding out, ſhould ſend a Meſſiah amongſt them, whoſe firſt and outward appearance ſhould be the reverſe of their expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; in whoſe pretenſions there is nothing flattering to the pride and ambition of man; and who, inſtead of winking at the vices and errors of the times (which it was the intereſt of an impoſtor to do) ſhould attack, with faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the wickedneſs, errors and prejudices of all ranks of men, without partiality—if this were the caſe, is it at all to be wondered at that ſuch a generation of men, without the fear of God, and blind to that excellence which only is excellence in the ſight of the Moſt Holy, ſhould deſpiſe and reject ſuch a Meſſiah? Is it at all marvellous, that men governed only by worldly motives, and whoſe hearts and lives were eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tranged from all good, ſhould do every thing in their power to get <hi>him</hi> out of their way, who was conſtantly expoſing the degeneracy of their principles, and pouring out the threatenings of God againſt their vices? Surely the voice of reaſon and truth ſays, <q>No; the wicked will do wickedly.</q>

               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:028290_0016_0FD8812D33360BE0"/>
Certain I am, that there is nothing in the conduct of ſuch men towards ſuch a perſon, though the moſt blameleſs in his life, the moſt amiable in his manners, and though he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed a thouſand times more wonders of power and goodneſs than are recorded of Jeſus, which may not be as ſatisfactorily accounted for on the principles of degenerate nature, as the conduct of any of their forefathers towards the prophets whom they perſecuted and ſlew.</p>
            <p>And if it be probable (and more than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable) that the men among whom Jeſus appeared were blind and wicked enough to murder the true Meſſiah, if God ſhould permit them ſo to do, is it not as probable that the next and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding generations might be ſo under the power of prejudice as to exert all their talents to juſtify the conduct of their fathers, not only by miſrepreſenting the characters of Jeſus and his followers, but alſo by giving ſuch gloſſes to the prophecies as might beſt agree with their prejudices, and which might tend to turn away the force of thoſe arguments which Chriſtians deduced from the in favour of their cauſe? Certainly it is. And hence your writers have explained away the cleareſt predictions of the Meſſiah, till there remains ſcarce any proof of the promiſe of ſuch a perſon.</p>
            <p>Conſidering then the probability of this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiding prejudice, it highly becomes you, as reaſonable men, ſeeking after truth, and as you wiſh to know the cauſe of God's diſpleaſure, to be on your guard, and cautious of receiving implicitly what your wiſeſt men have taught, and eſpecially in their comments on the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies; for as it is on theſe that the truth or impoſture of Chriſtianity turns, and as, the plain and moſt obvious meaning of them being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:028290_0017_0FD8812EFA2B4BE0"/>numbers of them appear to meet and have their accompliſhment in Jeſus, they are neceſſitated by their principles to ſeek after ſuch interpretations as may leaſt favour Chriſtianity. To find out truth, you muſt ſee with your own eyes; you muſt read the prophecies, and judge for yourſelves; you muſt carefully look into our ſcriptures, and ſee what is there related and taught reſpecting Jeſus and his doctrine; and on theſe, jointly, you muſt ground your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, for or againſt. To theſe, in conjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we appeal as the teſt of truth, and not to what erring men have wrote or ſaid on this ſide or that; for as your ſacred writings, in every eſſential part, remain uncorrupted in ſpite of all your backſlidings, and amidſt all the various fortunes which have awaited you; ſo do ours in ſpite of the degeneracy of Chriſtians, their vices, and their errors.</p>
            <p>To our ſacred books, in conjunction with yours, let us therefore appeal. In the courſe of my acquaintance with thoſe of your nation, I have more than once had occaſion to obſerve, that their greateſt ſtumbling-block has been their taking that for Chriſtianity, which is no more than fallible explication, or mere human opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. But ſearch the ſcriptures themſelves; compare ours with Moſes and the Prophets, and ſee what theſe teſtify of Chriſt, and how they agree. Examine whether the authenticity of the facts related, and the divinity of the doctrines taught, in our ſcriptures, and thoſe related and taught in yours, do not ſtand upon the ſame ground. Examine, as men of wiſdom and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, whether the external and internal evidence of their being from God, or otherwiſe, do not ſtand or fall together.</p>
            <p>Were there ſuch men as Moſes, David, Iſaiah,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:028290_0018_0FD88131370FBFB8"/>&amp;c. and did they do, teach and write, what is aſcribed to them? And were there not ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as Jeſus, Matthew, Paul, &amp;c. and did not they do, teach and write, what is aſcribed to them?—The anſwer of prejudice or indolence is nothing.—What is the anſwer of reaſon, after diſpaſſionate enquiry? In the former caſe, the truth reſts on the characters of the relaters, the ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>umſtances which attended them, the credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of hiſtory, &amp;c. So in the latter. There is no greater proof that the Lord appeared to Moſes in the wilderneſs, and ſpoke to him out of the midſt of a burning buſh<note n="*" place="bottom">Exod. iii.</note>; than that Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, James and John, ſaw Jeſus transfigured on the mount<note n="†" place="bottom">Matt. xvii.</note>. There is no greater proof that Elijah was taken up into heaven<note n="‡" place="bottom">2 Kings ii.</note>, and that Eliſha, with the mantle of his aſcended Maſter, divided the waters of Jordan, than that Jeſus was carried up into heaven in the preſence of his diſciples<note n="‖" place="bottom">Luke xxiv.</note>, and that they afterwards healed the moſt obſtinate diſeaſes in his name<note n="§" place="bottom">Acts iii.</note>.</p>
            <p>That what Moſes and the Prophets taught was of divine authority, reſts eminently on the internal evidence which accompanies their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. We contemplate the characters of the men, the views which actuated them, the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which attended them, the moral ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence of their doctrine, &amp;c. and the more we examine, the more we are obliged to acknowledge whoſe ſervants they were, and that they ſpake as they were moved by the Spirit of God. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Jeſus were ſent of God, and what he taught divine, or not, reſts on the ſame evidence. As to his doctrine; if what he taught tends to give us unworthy ideas of the Creator, to alienate our hearts from the God of Abraham, and to
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:028290_0019_0FD88132AA3F5E60"/>ſlacken the moral obligations of men, then he is not of God. But if his doctrine be replete with every moral excellence; if its tendency be to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the wickedneſs of the world, to purify the heart, and elevate the mind to God, then hath it all the proofs of divinity which the writings of Moſes and the Prophets poſſeſs.

            <p>IT is to be expected that the great Anointed of God, the works which he is to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, and the ſalvation which he is to bring, will occupy the moſt diſtinguiſhed place in prophecy, and be the chief theme of inſpiration. This was the idea of the ancient Jews; hence when jealous Herod was informed of the birth of the King of the Jews<note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. ii. 4.</note>, he gathered together the chief prieſts and ſcribes of the people, who might be ſuppoſed beſt ſkilled in the myſteries of the ſacred books, and demanded of them where Chriſt ſhould be born. And they ſaid unto him, <q>In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written by the prophet<note n="†" place="bottom">Micah v. 2.</note>
               </q> &amp;c. And that this was the idea of the ancient Jews appears from the Talmud, which ſays that all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies of the Prophets related to Chriſt. But, is it not a truth much to be lamented, that ſince
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:028290_0023_0FD8813F1D1EA2B8"/>the days of Jeſus, thoſe who have been prejudiced againſt him, exerting all their ingenuity to give to the prophecies ſuch explanations as might leaſt agree with his character and doctrine, have thus well nigh ſhut him out of the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? So that thoſe prophecies which moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly refer to him, are made to terminate in the Prophet who ſpeaks, or in Joſiah, Zerubba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, Joſhua the high prieſt, Cyrus, or any other perſon, the moſt unlikely; as Hircanus, whom Herod ſlew; Agrippa the younger, &amp;c. It much intereſts you, therefore, to examine the ſacred writings with your own underſtandings, and to conſider well, whether many of thoſe prophecies which your writers make to refer to others, do not point to the Meſſiah. And in many caſes, where inferior characters and events may be the ground-work of what the Prophets ſpeak, it is worth while to conſider whether the Meſſiah be not the ultimate object in whom the principal matters terminate. It agreeing not with the deſign of prophecy that its whole mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhould lie unconcealed, we find that many of the prophecies are of a mixed nature, and point to two objects at once, or ſpeak of one as the type of another. Thus predictions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the return from Babylon, under the edicts of Cyrus and his ſucceſſors, are mixed with others which reſpect your return and glory in the laſt days, and one is made the type of the other. Thus David often ſpeaks of <hi>himſelf</hi> as a type of the Saviour who was to come; and in like manner the Prophets often ſpeak of others. The prophecies are a ſort of enigmas, which nothing but the accompliſhment can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain; with this key, all the myſtery is laid open, and he who runs may read—with theſe ideas reſpecting the prophetic writings, let us candidly
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:028290_0024_0FD881412C765EB8"/>enquire what your ſacred ſcriptures predict of the Meſſiah, and ſee whether they meet with accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment in Jeſus or not.</p>
            <p n="1">I. They foretel of him that he is to be a perſon of ſupereminent character; ſuperior to all preceding prophets, prieſts or kings; ſuperior to all men, and even to angels.

            <p n="2">II. Examine the prophecies, and ſee whether the Meſſiah was not to be born of a virgin. Is not this idea ſuggeſted in thoſe words of God, which conveyed to our fallen parents and their deſcendants the firſt promiſe of grace? <q>The LORD God ſaid unto the ſerpent (the devil) I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between her ſeed and thy ſeed; it ſhall bruiſe thy head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heel<note n="**" place="bottom">Gen. iii. 15.</note>.</q> Conſult alſo Iſa. vii. 14. <q>Behold

And ſeeing that nothing is too hard for God; ſeeing that ſuch a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous conception would be to the honour of the Meſſiah, and worthy of the ſupereminence of his character; ſeeing that though conceived out of the ordinary courſe of nature, he may ſtill be of the feed of Abraham, and the ſon of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid (his mother being in that line) and as there is nothing in the prophets which obliges us to reject this idea, it is more than probable that theſe predictions refer to ſuch an event.—In Jeſus they are all accompliſhed, as you may ſee, if you will read Matt. i. and Luke i.</p>
            <p n="3">III. According to the Prophets, a notable meſſenger is to go before the Meſſiah to prepare his way. <q>The voice of one that crieth in the wilderneſs, Prepare ye the way of the LORD, make ſtraight in the deſert an high way for our God<note n="†" place="bottom">Iſa. xl. 3.</note>."—"Behold I will ſend my meſſenger, and he ſhall prepare the way before me, and the LORD whom ye ſeek ſhall ſuddenly come to his temple.

            </p>
            <p>All this makes it evident, that ſome eminent prophet is to precede the coming of the Meſſiah<note n="†" place="bottom">Whether there may not be two ſuch perſons predicted of, one to precede the Meſſiah's firſt appearance, and the other previous to his coming at the end of the world, deſerves conſideration.

            <p>Let us now attend to the hiſtory of Jeſus, and ſee whether there be any prophet preceding his appearance, bearing any likeneſs to the predic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <q>An Angel appeared to Zacharias while he executed the prieſt's office in the temple, and ſaid unto him, Thy wife ſhall bear thee a ſon, and thou ſhalt call his name John. He ſhall be great in the ſight of the Lord; and many of the children of Iſrael ſhall he turn to the Lord their God. And he ſhall go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him in the ſpirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the diſobedient to the wiſdom of the juſt; to make ready a people prepared of the Lord<note n="*" place="bottom">Luke i. 5.</note>."—"Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Ceſar, the word of the Lord came unto John, the ſon of Zacharias, in the wilderneſs. And he came into all the country about Jordan preaching the baptiſm of repentance for the remiſſion of ſins. As it is written in the book of the words of Eſaias the prophet, ſaying, The voice of one crying in the wilderneſs, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths ſtraight. And as the people were in expectation, and all men muſed in their hearts of John whether he were the
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:028290_0029_0FD8814AC2E28680"/>Chriſt or not, John anſwered ſaying unto them all, I indeed baptize you with water, but one mightier than I cometh, the latchet of whoſe ſhoes I am not worthy to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looſe<note n="†" place="bottom">Luke iii.</note>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Contemplate his hiſtory, work and doctrine. An angel announced him; a man of a holy life; he baptized in water, as the emblem of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the emblem of dying to ſin, and riſing to newneſs of life: he preached repentance, and gave notice of the ſudden appearance of him who had been the burthen of prophecy. All the people held John to be a prophet<note n="†" place="bottom">Matt. xxi. 26.</note>; and hence they ſuppoſed (according to Joſephus<note n="§" place="bottom">Antiq. Lib. 18. c. 7.</note> who ſpeaks highly of his character, as do other Jewiſh writers) that Herod's army on a certain occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion miſcarried in judgment upon him for put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting John to death. On account of his piety and doctrine he obtained the character of "One of the wiſe men of Iſrael." It was from this high eſtimation in which he was held, that a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn deputation was ſent to him to enquire who he was<note n="‖" place="bottom">John 1.19—28.</note>? He confeſſed that he was not the Chriſt, nor Elias (not literally, according to the then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing idea of the Elias who was to come) not that prophet (of whom Moſes ſpoke) but the voice of one crying in the wilderneſs, <q>Make ſtraight the way of the Lord, as ſaid the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Eſaias<note n="‖" place="bottom">John 1.19—28.</note>.</q> Does not this meſſenger well agree with the predictions which pointed out that prophet to the notice of Iſrael, who was to go before the face of the Lord, and prepare the way for the appearance of his Anointed?</p>
            <p n="4">IV. As the Meſſiah was to be a Prophet of the higheſt rank (and more than a Prophet) may it not be expected, that in proof of his miſſion he
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:028290_0030_0FD88150EC85A0F8"/>ſhould perform miracles, and prophecy of things to come? It is evident that the ancient Jews expected that their Meſſiah would do many wonderful works; hence ſome ſaid unto Jeſus, <q>What ſign ſheweſt thou unto us, ſeeing that thou doeſt theſe things<note n="*" place="bottom">John ii. 18.</note>?" and others ſaid, When Chriſt cometh, will he do more mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles than theſe<note n="†" place="bottom">Matt. xii. 38.</note>?</q> Perhaps it was in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to theſe prophetic gifts that it was ſaid, <q>Thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy Power<note n="§" place="bottom">Pſal. cx. 3.</note>
               </q> And again, the <q>Spirit of the LORD ſhall reſt upon him, the Spirit of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and underſtanding, the ſpirit of counſel and might, the ſpirit of knowledg and of the fear of the LORD<note n="‖" place="bottom">Iſa. xi. 2.</note>
               </q> &amp;c. But whether the Prophets have directly ſpoken of this or not, it is ſurely perfectly conſiſtent with his character thus to be inveſted with power from on high, (and in ſome ſenſe neceſſary) to demonſtrate that he is of God. It may be juſtly expected that he who is repreſented as the moſt eminent Prophet, the great burthen of prophecy, of whom inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath ſpoken and ſung from the depths of antiquity, ſhould be diſtinguiſhed with gifts ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to others<note n="**" place="bottom">Dr. Prieſtley ſpeaks of the miracles of Jeſus Chriſt as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior, in point of magnitude and ſplendour, to thoſe of Moſes, The juſtneſs of this conceſſion might be diſputed. The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of Moſes, in general, were as the ſplendour of light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; but thoſe of Jeſus Chriſt were as the ſun, clear, ſteady and benign.</note>.</p>
            <p>An impoſtor might ſhew juggling ſigns and wonders, which might deceive the ignorant; or, perhaps, by the agency of evil ſpirits (who may be able to look farther into cauſes and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects than men) he might be able to diſcover
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:028290_0031_0FD8815233299090"/>events which lay hid from common eyes, and by thoſe ſigns might lead the people after ſtrange gods, as Moſes forewarned<note n="†" place="bottom">Deut. xiii. 1.</note>. God might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit theſe things as the trial of obedience. But, did ever any impoſtor raiſe the dead, or give ſight to one who was born blind? Such won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as theſe require the agency of the Creator, and which was never granted to a deceiver. If miracles, which nothing but the power of God can perform, be any proof of a true Prophet, here proof abounds. By a touch, by a word, by the efficiency of his will, he healed all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of diſeaſes, caſt out devils, controled the elements, and raiſed the dead.</p>
            <p>None pretend to deny that Jeſus wrought many wonderful works, far tranſcending hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man power. So irreſiſtible is the proof of it, that your nation have been obliged to allow it. Many who ſaw them, indeed, ſaid <q>He caſteth out devils, through the prince of the devils<note n="†" place="bottom">Matt. ix. 34.</note>,</q> and others, to get rid of the argument, which is drawn from hence in favour of his being from God, have pretended that he did them by means of ſome ineffable name of Jehovah. But ſurely, it is too irrational (not to ſay too impious) to ſuppoſe, that the great Eternal would permit his name to be turned into a taliſman to favour the tricks of a juggling impoſtor; or that a few letters, however arranged, or however pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, ſhould have in them the power of healing diſeaſes, and raiſing the dead. This might do in the very darkeſt ages of ſuperſtition; but have not all men, where revelation, reaſon and philoſophy, have carried their light, learnt more wiſdom? Surely that poor man who was born blind reaſoned better than this, when they of the Sanhedrim ſaid unto him, <q>We know
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:028290_0032_0FD881544BBBF7A0"/>that God ſpake unto Moſes; as for this fellow, we know not whence he is<note n="*" place="bottom">John ix. 29, &amp;c.</note>
               </q> The man anſwered and ſaid unto them, <q>Why herein is a marvellous thing that <hi>ye</hi> know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes. Now <hi>we</hi> know that God heareth not ſinners; but if any man be a worſhipper of God, and doth his will, him he heareth. Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind; if this man were not of God, he could do nothing." q. d. "It is marvellous indeed that <hi>you,</hi> great and learned men, ſhould not know from whence this man is, who hath wrought ſuch a miracle; when <hi>we</hi> unletter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and blind beggars know, that the holy and Almighty God is not the accomplice of deceivers; <hi>we</hi> know that ſuch power, as in this caſe is manifeſted, is communicated only to them who are the true ſervants of God.</q> Ah! man, thou knoweſt not the power of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, or thou wouldſt marvel at nothing. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice makes light darkneſs, and darkneſs light; good evil, and evil good.</p>
            <p>And is the gift of foretelling future events a criterion of a true Prophet, and what may be expected to dwell in the Meſſiah in an eminent manner? In Jeſus we find the Spirit of the Lord, the ſpirit of wiſdom and underſtanding. He perceived the thoughts of mens hearts. He knew beforehand who would betray him. His eye penetrated into the depths of futurity, and ſaw through the future fortunes of the Jewiſh nation. What meant he to teach the Jews by his parable of the huſbandmen who firſt refuſed to render unto the houſeholder the fruit of his vineyard, and afterward murdered his only
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:028290_0033_0FD8815561F9C100"/>ſon<note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. xxi. 33.</note>? What meant he when he faid, <q>There ſhall not be left here (in the temple) one ſtone upon another that ſhall not be thrown down. —Many ſhall come in my name, ſaying, I am Chriſt; and ſhall deceive many. Then ſhall be great tribulation, ſuch as was not ſince the beginning of the world to this time<note n="†" place="bottom">Matt. xxiv. 2, 5, 21.</note>?</q> But</p>
            <p n="5">V. However great and numerous the proofs of the Meſſiah's miſſion, yet they are not to be attended with that terror which prevailed at Sinai. Hear Moſes. <q>The Lord thy God will raiſe up unto thee a Prophet, from the midſt of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ſhall ye hearken.

This is clearly a promiſe of the Meſſiah, and a prophetic deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his character. And how perfectly does the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ſtory of the doctrines, and works of Jeſus, agree with this prediction! Here are no thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, nor lightnings, nor the voice of trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, to make even a Moſes fear and quake, and the people exclaim, <q>Let not God ſpeak with us, leſt we die.</q> The loweſt may approach to learn of Jeſus, for he is meek and lowly in heart; and what he hath heard of his Father, that he ſpeaketh in language which does not terrify, but invites attention. His doctrine is at once full of grace, and full of truth. Though it aſtoniſh, it does not affright; and if to confirm his miſſion he diſplay the power of God, yet it is in a way which accords with the promiſe. His wonders are wonders of compaſſion and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:028290_0034_0FD881576B614920"/>and even where there may be ſome mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of terror, mercy predominates. <q>All they that had any ſick with divers diſeaſes, brought them unto him, and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them. And devils alſo came out of many, crying out, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Thou art Chriſt the Son of God<note n="*" place="bottom">Luke iv. 40, 41.</note>.</q>—He raiſed the dead; but he never called for ſire to come down from heaven to deſtroy mens lives. He ſtilled, but he never raiſed a tempeſt. He is in all things according to the deſire of Iſrael in Horeb. <q>And whoſoever will not hearken unto my words, ſaith the Lord, which he ſhall ſpeak in my name, I will require it of him<note n="†" place="bottom">Deut. xviii. 19.</note>.</q> God foreſaw that ſome would not hearken to this Prophet, whom he promiſes. Search the ſcriptures, and ſee whether they do not teſtify of Jeſus, and prove him to be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Prophet.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. Both the life and doctrine of the Meſſiah are to be eminently holy; both agreeing with that law which was written with the finger of God, and given to Moſes in Mount Sinai.

But though agreeable to the prophecy he ſaid, "I am a King;" yet he ſaid alſo, "My kingdom is not of this world;" and when the populace would have taken him by force, and made him King, he departed into a mountain himſelf alone; for he was God's, and not man's Anointed.

            <p>You have doubtleſs been taught to give ſuch explanations to theſe paſſages, as may leaſt favour the Chriſtian cauſe. But for a moment, as lovers of truth, lay aſide as much of the prejudice of education as you can, and conſider whether the appearance of Jeſus does not exactly anſwer to theſe predictions, and afford the eaſieſt ſolution. Judah hath ſhared the ſame fate with Ephraim, and the ſceptre is departed; but before their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity was utterly broken, and they ſcattered over the face of the whole earth, Jeſus appeared to gather together in himſelf all people, Jews and Gentiles. And, exactly at the time foretold by Daniel, he made his appearance, and was cut off, but not for himſelf.</p>
            <p>To get rid of the argument which this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage offers, in favour of Jeſus being the Chriſt, your writers have explained it as not referring to the promiſed BRANCH of David; though
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:028290_0042_0FD88165184B6FC8"/>they are not agreed among themſelves of whom the Prophet ſpeaks. Some by the Meſſiah, in the 25th verſe, underſtand Zerubbabel, others Joſhua the high prieſt, and a third claſs interpret it of Cyrus. By Meſſiah, in the 26th verſe, who was to be out off, ſome underſtand Hircanus the high prieſt, whom Herod ordered to be put to death; and others, king Agrippa, who, they ſay, was out off by Veſpaſian. But is not this contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the plain meaning of the text, and offering it the greateſt violence? It is evident, to every unbiaſſed reader, that one perſon is ſpoken of through the prophecy. The number of weeks that were to paſs, before the appearance of Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah the Prince, prove that neither Zerubbabel, Joſhua nor Cyrus, could be the perſon referred to. From the order to reſtore and build Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, unto the Meſſiah the Prince, were to be ſeven weeks, and threeſcore and two weeks, i. e. ſixty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine weeks: but which is thus broken into two periods, to mark out the important event of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem's reſtoration, and the time it ſhould take to perfect that work, viz. ſeven weeks (forty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine years.) But, even ſuppoſing the Prophet to ſay, <q>It is ſeven weeks to the Meſſiah the Prince;</q> this does not agree with either of theſe perſons. Read. <q>From the going forth of the commandment (either that recorded in Ez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra i. vi. or vii.) to reſtore and build Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, ſhall be ſeven weeks." It is not "From the <hi>deſtruction</hi> of Jeruſalem to the Meſſiah the Prince," but, "From the going forth of the commandment to <hi>reſtore</hi> and <hi>build</hi> it, to the Meſſiah</q> &amp;c. Who (under God) ſent forth the commandment? Cyrus, Darius, or Artax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erxes. And to whom was it given as the heads of the Jewiſh nation?

<pb n="40" facs="unknown:028290_0043_0FD88166E66139D0"/>or Joſhua, therefore, the Meſſiah the Prince, will involve us in the greateſt abſurdities.

            <p>The Meſſiah, mentioned in the 26th verſe, which ſome interpret of Hircanus, and others of Agrippa, is ſurely no other than the perſon ſpoken of in the preceding verſe. Nothing can be plainer. But is not the perſon here pointed out of more eminence than either of theſe? Was Hircanus the moſt holy? or did his cutting off make reconciliation for iniquities, and bring in everlaſting righteouſneſs? Did he confirm the covenant with many for one week? Criticiſm and prejudice may make the text applicable to any body, or ſpeak any thing which may anſwer a purpoſe; but look on the face of it, and ſay whoſe likeneſs it bears. As to Agrippa, he does not appear to be of eminence enough to be thus ſpoken of; and of his cutting off there is not ſufficient proof, and none at all for the ends and conſequences of it mentioned in the prophecy. When expoſitors are reduced to ſuch contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and glaring abſurdities, is it not a reaſon, at leaſt, to examine candidly, whether Jeſus, in whoſe hiſtory and pretenſions the prophecy meets with the eaſieſt ſolution, be not the perſon pointed out? The Meſſiah was to appear after ſixty-nine weeks; then did Jeſus appear.—He was to be cut off, but not for himſelf, ſo was it with Jeſus.— He was to finiſh tranſgreſſion, to make an end of ſin, to make reconciliation, and to bring in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:028290_0044_0FD8816BB7E7A540"/>righteouſneſs; and this, the Chriſtian doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine teaches us, Jeſus did.—He was to confirm the covenant with many for one week; this Jeſus did, by the miniſtry of his forerunner and of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. —And then was the people of the prince to come and deſtroy the city and ſanctuary, as did the Romans in leſs than forty years after the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off of Jeſus. If this be not a prophecy of the Meſſiah, the BRANCH of David, the Prince of princes, where ſhall we find a promiſe of him which may not be quibbled away?</p>
            <p>And if Jeſus be not the perſon, where ſhall we find in the records of hiſtory that <hi>Deſire</hi> of all nations, whoſe preſence was to fill the ſecond temple with glory? This temple has been long ſince deſtroyed, and not one ſtone left upon another to denominate it the ſame. And where do we find the fulfilment of the promiſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable peace, if not in that doctrine of peace which was preached by and through Jeſus? that doctrine whoſe gentle ſtream bleſſes the ſouls of the righteous with peace, amidſt all the agitating tumults and troubles of the world. Surely this is that Deſire of all nations who was to come and ſpeak peace to them who are near, and to them who are afar off.</p>
            <p>Having advanced thus far in your enquiries after the characteriſtics of the Meſſiah, and the pretenſions of Jeſus, ſtop, and conſider well the weight of evidence for and againſt. And let it be remembered, that it is nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that in <hi>ſome</hi> inſtances you may ſuppoſe the prophecies miſapplied; or, at leaſt, that they will bear a different interpretation; or that you may think you diſcover <hi>ſome</hi> things in the hiſtory of Jeſus which accord not with the prophecies, or which lay the goſpel open to objections. The matter to be conſidered is, the great maſs of
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:028290_0045_0FD8816D5737A250"/>evidence. And remember the truth of the doctrine of Chriſtianity does not depend for its proof, any more than the law of Moſes, upon the etymology of a word, or upon ſome detached circumſtance. A very little wit ſharpened by prejudice may cut, and pare, and trim a word to ſuit any purpoſe, and give to detached cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances any appearance. But here is a great body of prophecy and a vaſt body of facts, which are ſuperior to the arts of criticiſm. They form a long extended range of mountains, which no aſſault of man can ſhake or ſeparate, and which no length of time can impair.</p>
            <p>Whilſt the prophecies remain, and the hiſtory of Jeſus is known, neither Jew nor Gentile need be at any loſs for grounds of enquiry into the truth or impoſture of the pretenſions of the Son of Mary. If Chriſtianity be an impoſture, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is the moſt extraordinary one that was ever heard of! Is it not ſtrange, that ſo many prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies ſhould unite their teſtimonies in its favour? Is it not ſingular, that to get rid of the accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated teſtimony to the truth of the pretenſion of Jeſus, we muſt put the moſt forced and unnatural conſtruction upon many of the ſacred predic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? What ought a wiſe man, who fears God, to do? Should he reſiſt ſuch evidence, becauſe ſome things turn up in the Meſſiah's character the reverſe of what he has been uſed to think of it? the reverſe of what fallible men have taught him to believe? Should he reſiſt ſuch evidence, becauſe in ſome inſtances he diſcovers what he cannot explain, or the propriety of which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee? Surely not. Go, O man, if thou feareſt God, and wouldſt lay hold on his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, go into thy cloſet, and ſhut thy door upon thee; pray to him who ſeeth in ſecret, and whoſe cars are open to the prayers of the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous; pray that he would pour his ſpirit upon
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:028290_0046_0FD87E2AD673CD80"/>thee, to teach thee wherefore it is that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth with your nation, what the ſin of Iſrael is, and where the way of truth; for he hath not forgotten his covenant. He waiteth that he may be gracious.</p>
            <p n="10">X. Enquire whether the prophets have not predicted, that the Jewiſh people are to reject the Meſſiah, and for that reaſon be ſcattered over all nations, till they repent? Moſes ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes the poſſibility of ſome refuſing to hear <hi>that Prophet</hi> which God would raiſe up, as you may ſee Deut. xviii. 19. There are many prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies which clearly ſpeak of this. I ſhall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but two or three. The former part of the 32d chap. of Iſaiah is evidently a prophecy of the Meſſiah: <q>Behold a king ſhall reign in righteouſneſs,</q> &amp;c. Here the Prophet ſpeaks of the excellence of the Meſſiah's government, ver. 4. <q>The heart of the raſh ſhall underſtand knowledge,</q> &amp;c. But remark his different language, ver. 9th and on, <q>Riſe up ye careleſs women that are at eaſe, hear my voice ye care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs daughters; give ear unto my ſpeech. Many days and years ſhall ye be trouble.— Upon the land of my people ſhall come up thorns and briars.—The palaces ſhall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken, the multitude of the city ſhall be left, the forts and towers ſhall be for dens forever, a joy of wild aſſes, a paſture of flocks.</q> And how long ſhall theſe days and years of trouble continue? ver. 15. <q>Until the ſpirit be poured upon us from on high,</q> &amp;c. How perfectly does this accord with the Chriſtian faith! What a clear delineation of facts ſubſequent to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of Jeſus!

<pb n="44" facs="unknown:028290_0047_0FD8816EABA01358"/>chief prieſts and elders, with the rulers of the people, procured his death: and ſince this for many days and years hath Iſrael been in trouble; the land of God's people is thorns and briars; the palaces are forſaken, and their days and years of trouble will not end till the Spirit be poured upon them from on high, and they repent. Then this <q>work of righteouſneſs ſhall be peace, and the effect of righteouſneſs, quietneſs, and aſſurance forever.</q> ver. 17.—See alſo Iſa. xlii.

Who will hearken and hear for the time to come? ver. 24. Who gave Jacob for a ſpoil, and Iſrael to the robbers? Did not I the Lord, againſt whom they have ſinned? For they would not walk in his ways, neither were they obedient unto his law. ver. 25. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath poured upon them the fury of his anger, and the ſtrength of battle, and it hath ſet him on fire round about, yet he knew it not; and it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart.</q>

What is the meaning of thoſe words of the Lord to the ſerpent in Gen. iii. 15. <q>I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy ſeed and her ſeed; it ſhall bruiſe thy head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heel?</q> Doubtleſs there is much obſcurity in the text, as there is in the whole relation which Moſes gives of the fall of man.

And though that day is not arrived, when the knowledge of the Lord ſhall cover the earth as the waters do the ſea<note n="‖" place="bottom">Iſa. xi. 9.</note>, for the doctrine of the kingdom of God is as a grain of muſtard-ſeed, yet has not the light of God ſpread far,

And is there not a firm foundation laid for the kingdom of peace and righteouſneſs? Our ſcriptures have foretold a declenſion of the Chriſtian church; and warned us of Antichriſt, whoſe ſorceries ſhould prevail one thouſand two hundred and ſixty years, to the hindrance of the peaceful and righteous kingdom of God. When this period terminates, then we hope to ſee fulfilled, the glorious things which are ſpoken of the city of God.—We hope it is at hand. Then ſhall he ſprinkle many na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſanctify them for his own inheritance, as he did Iſrael of old in Horeb, when Moſes with the blood of the covenant ſprinkled the people; and then, as at Sinai, to the ends of the earth ſhall it be heard, <q>All that the LORD hath ſaid will we do, and be obedient.</q> Our eyes are fixed on your nation, praying for your converſion, that by this the Gentiles may be awakened to a more attentive conſideration of the doctrine which they profeſs; and, from your riſing, receive that increaſe of light, which ſhall chaſe away this darkneſs which now obſcures us. <q>Awake, awake then by repentance, and put on thy ſtrength, O Zion. How beautiful up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the mountains ſhall the feet of him be, who bringeth good tidings, who publiſheth peace! Thy watchmen ſhall lift up the voice, with the voice together ſhall they ſing. The Lord will make bare his arm in the eyes of all the nations, and all the ends of the earth ſhall ſee the ſalvation of our God<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſa. lii. 2.7, 8.1.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>For, 2dly, with the Gentiles, he is to gather together the diſperſed of Iſrael and Judah: to bring them back to God, from whom they have
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:028290_0059_0FD881856190ED10"/>departed; and to reſtore them to their own land. Of this ſpeak the Prophets. <q>And it ſhall come to paſs in that day that the Lord ſhall ſet his hand again the ſecond time to recover the remnant of Iſrael, and gather together the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed of Judah from the four corners of the earth<note n="†" place="bottom">Iſa. xi. 11, 12.</note>."—"Behold the days come, ſaith the Lord, that I will raiſe unto David a righteous BRANCH.—In his days Judah ſhall be ſaved, and Iſrael ſhall dwell ſafely, and this is the name whereby he ſhall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS<note n="*" place="bottom">Jer. xxiii. 5, 6.</note>."—"He ſhall ſit as a refiner; then ſhall the offering of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah and Jeruſalem be pleaſant unto the Lord as in the days of old and as in former years<note n="††" place="bottom">Mal. iii. 3, 4.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the ſalvation of Iſrael, their converſion from ſin, and reſtoration to their own land, are clearly the works of the Meſſiah<note n="‡" place="bottom">Whether the Jews will be converted to Chriſtianity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their reſtoration to Canaan, or afterwards; whether it will be effected by the viſible appearance of Jeſus Chriſt, as ſome conclude from Zech. xiv. and ſuck like predictions, or in a more ordinary way, according to others, is not the preſent enquiry. However this deeply humble themſelves for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect God's favour till they deeply humble themſelves for their ſins, and which cannot be, unleſs they ſet themſelves ſeriouſly and diſpaſſionately to ſearch their ways. Let them do this, and no doubt can be entertained but mercy will break upon them, let the order or method of the fulfilment of the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They were not accompliſhed by the reſtoration under Cyrus and his ſucceſſors; for ſince that you have been awfully<note n="§" place="bottom">See Jer. iii. 12.</note> defiled with your tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, and are ſo now; you have been a prey to your enemies, and the beaſts of the land have devoured you; from which evils the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets promiſe deliverance<note n="‖" place="bottom">Ezek. xxxiv. 23, 25.</note> when the Meſſiah
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:028290_0060_0FD88186A918A140"/>ſhall riſe to ſave you. But length of time does not make void the promiſe; nor do your preſent circumſtances at all tend to weaken the proof of Jeſus being that Saviour whom God promiſed; on the contrary, conſidered in connexion with the other prophecies, your preſent diſperſion ſerves much to confirm it. We have ſhewn, from your prophets, that Iſrael was to reject the Meſſiah, and for it to experience days and years of trouble, till they ſhould repent. Our ſcriptures teach, that God having raiſed up his Son Jeſus, ſent him to bleſs you, by turning you from your inquities;—that had you obeyed his voice, he would have gathered you together, as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings; he would have ſaved you, but ye would not; therefore your houſe was left unto you deſolate; —that for unbelief ye were broken off, though not caſt away; but that when ye ſhall believe, ye ſhall be grafted in again, and all Iſrael ſhall be ſaved; as it is written, <q>There ſhall come out on Sion a Deliverer, and ſhall turn away un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs from Jacob.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Allowing, for a moment (prejudice aſide) that Jeſus is the promiſed Saviour, your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion treating him as they did, was it not juſt in God (for ſurely it muſt be a crime the moſt ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated) to chaſtiſe them for it, til<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> they repent? And though his chaſtiſements extend through more than ſeventeen hundred years (they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing ſtill in unbelief) does this at all render void the promiſe, if on their repentance his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour riſe up for their deliverance, and perform for them all the good which the prophets have promiſed?</p>
            <p>But in the Meſſiah you expect a temporal Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour only, and are prejudiced againſt Jeſus, becauſe he is held forth principally as ſpiritual
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:028290_0061_0FD87E2EF7EBC008"/>one, and that for all people. But ſurely the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count which the Chriſtian Scriptures give us of the character of Chriſt, and of the nature of his work and kingdom, is by no means contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to the ancient prophecies; or at all deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory either to the perfections of God, or the glory of his Anointed. If you ſearch the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, ur biaſſed by prejudice and a worldly heart, you may ſoon learn, that the Saviour who is promiſed, is to be not only a temporal one to you, but alſo a ſpiritual one to all people. Hence that feaſt of fat things and victory over death, of which Iſaiah ſpeaks<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſa. xxv. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

And Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachi ſays, <q>He ſhall purify the ſons of Levi, and purge them as gold and ſilver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs<note n="†" place="bottom">Mal. iii. 3.</note>.</q> Surely the prophets ſpeak of ſomething more than temporal bleſſings! It is a feaſt ſuited to the wants of the ſoul; it is light which informs the mind, and purification from moral pollution.

Yes, he is the Saviour of all people, the King of all nations! He brings ſpiritual as well as temporal ſalvation.

            <p>LET us now conſider the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies which are borne in favour of Jeſus being the CHRIST. There are teſtimonies which might be collected from profane authors; but let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine ourſelves to what the hiſtorians of Jeſus and the writers of the Acts of the Apoſtles have written. As relators of plain facts, what they affirm is as credible as what any other hiſtorian may have affirmed; eſpecially as they could have no intereſt in deceiving, but the contrary; and as, if what they related were not true, they might eaſily have been detected, and thus they would have deſtroyed the cauſe they meant to eſtabliſh; for theſe things were not done or ſpoken in a corner. It is certain then, that mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of all conditions did entertain a high opinion of the character, works, and doctrine of Jeſus; and even his enemies have given teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in his favour.</p>

All men took John for a prophet; even they who have not believed in Jeſus have teſtified that he was of God.

            <p>It is not brought to nought.

I hope you will excuſe the freedom, and be aſſured, though I may controvert your poſitions, that good-will and the love of truth are the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing principles of my heart; and which, I truſt, will guard me againſt ſaying any thing which might be offenſive to an ingenuous mind, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy the ſubject in diſpute.</p>
            <p>I aſſume not the ſtile of an anſwerer; that falls to the ſhare of thoſe who are better qualified: and though, from what I have advanced in my <hi>Friendly Addreſs to the Jews,</hi> there may be ſome
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:028290_0071_0FD8819EB21D6C08"/>propriety in my taking notice of what you have brought forward againſt the divinity of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian religion, yet the limits which I have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed myſelf, will allow me to do no more than make a few curſory Remarks upon your prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal arguments, and briefly ſhew, that, however they may affect the opinions of Dr. Prieſtley, they contain no ſolid objection againſt the divinity of the Chriſtian religion, as held forth in our ſacred ſcriptures.</p>
            <p>Surely, Sir, a man is not criminal for endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to convince his neighbour of what he ſuppoſes to be error; or for offering his hand, though it ſhould be a weak one, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o aſſiſt him in his reſearches after truth. His principle will plead for him, ſhould he need an excuſe, ſo long as he employs no other means than what reaſon and religion approve; for though you may not think the law of Moſes (the law of rites) obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory on all mankind; yet you muſt allow, that the Chriſtian religion, if it be true, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly obligatory on a Jew in the higheſt degree. A Chriſtian then who ſeeks to make converts, in the ſpirit of love, is by no means the object of blame, as you inſinuate in your introductory letter.</p>
            <p>Your ſufferings from Chriſtians, you ſay (p. 18) is one great argument with you againſt Chriſtianity's being the peaceable kingdom of the Meſſiah, as foretold by the Prophets; but you confeſs (p. 19) that the doctrines of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity do not teach, or authorize, to ſhed the blood of Jews (and you might have added of any people) and that you carefully diſtinguiſh between the doctrine and its profeſſors. Is the doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt in itſelf peaceful, ſo that if all men were to live under its influence, would the prophecies in this particular meet with ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment?
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:028290_0072_0FD881A0288667A8"/>And who can ſay, in that caſe, they would not? Here then is a ſtrong preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive evidence in its favour. Have the prophets any where ſaid that the doctrine of the Meſſiah's kingdom would <hi>inſtantaneouſly</hi> produce its great effects, in enlightening the Gentiles, in taming the ferocity, and ſubduing the wickedneſs of men; ſo that they ſhould no longer hurt nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſa. xi.</note>? No. The ſtone which was cut out of the mountain without hands, and which ſmote the image<note n="†" place="bottom">Dan. ii.</note>, that figured the monarchies of the earth, and brake it in pieces, and afterwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a great mountain, ſo that it filled the earth, at firſt was ſmall; time brought it to perfection. The doctrine of Jeſus hath not yet produced all the effects which the Prophets predicted, and which in its nature it is calculated to produce. Antichriſt has retarded its progreſs; but it ſhall prevail. It is prevailing. The reformation, for which you thank God (p. 6) is one event in his unſearchable government, which forwards the kingdom of peace; and he muſt ſhut his eyes who does not ſee that increaſing light, which tends to the perfection of that kingdom, which God in his inſcrutable providence, for the trial of the nations, and for the purpoſes of his own glory, hath ſo long permitted the wickedneſs of man to counteract. It is no argument then againſt Chriſtianity, becauſe all the good foretold by the Prophets is not at once produced, if in its own nature it be calculated to produce it; and eſpecially if the ſame authority which demands our cordial reception of it informs us, that this kingdom of God is as a grain of muſtard-ſeed, and that before the glorious days of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and peace it promiſes, iniquity ſhall prevail, and the man of ſin deceive the nations.</p>

As to what you have ſaid (p. 20, &amp;c.) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting Jeſus Chriſt as the ſecond perſon in the Trinity, or as a ſimple Prophet, according to ſome, it deſerves re-examination. Your idea of perſonality in the Trinity is not, I think, the idea of well-informed Trinitarians. There may be people (though I know of none, objectionable as the language of ſome may be) who conceive of three perſons in the Godhead as they do of the perſons of Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob. But however ſuch perſons may think in this caſe, look into our ſcriptures (theſe are the only teſt by which to try Chriſtianity;) they certainly teach the unity of God as much as your ſcriptures do. Do yours ſay, <q>Hear, O Iſrael, Jehovah our God is <hi>one</hi> Jehovah<note n="*" place="bottom">Deut. vi. 4.</note>?</q> Ours ſpeak the ſame language, <q>There is none other God but <hi>one.</hi>—To us there is but <hi>one</hi> God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him: and one Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom are all things, and we by him<note n="†" place="bottom">1 Cor. viii. 4—6.</note>."—"Now a Mediator is not a Mediator of one: but God is <hi>one</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Gal. iii. 20.</note>.</q> It is readily allowed, that that is ſaid of Jeſus Chriſt which it would be blaſphemy to ſay of any mere creature, as, <q>The Word was with God, and the Word was God<note n="§" place="bottom">John i. 1.</note>."—"In him dwelleth all fulneſs of the Godhead bodily<note n="‖" place="bottom">Col. ii. 9.</note>."—"God was manifeſt in the fleſh<note n="¶" place="bottom">1 Tim. iii. 16.</note>.</q> But this does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the unity of the Godhead any more than the doctrine of Jehovah's appearing to Abraham veil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a human body<note n="**" place="bottom">Gen. xviii.</note>, or of his dwelling in the Shechina<note n="††" place="bottom">2 Kings xix. 15.</note>; when we know that Jehovah is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumſcribed by the heaven of heavens. There is but one Infinite Intelligence, uncircumſcribed, and undivided in his nature; and when you can
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:028290_0074_0FD881A6F301B958"/>tell us how he dwelt in the man who appeared to Abraham, or between the cherubim; a Chriſtian will then be able to inform you how the fulneſs of the Godhead dwelt in Jeſus Chriſt bodily. How he who was with God, was God.</p>
            <p>With this eminence of character which is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to Jeſus, who can diſpute his right to abrogate the Moſaic diſpenſation, or to alter the law of marriage, of which you ſpeak?—Yea, even ſuppoſing him a mere man, according to Dr. Prieſtley, if he came with ſufficient creden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials, the Jews were obliged to receive him, though he announced himſelf commiſſioned to abrogate the ceremonial law. Moral laws are of eternal obligation; but poſitive inſtitutions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on the will of the legiſlator. God may add to, or take from them, as he pleaſes. For though the command given by Moſes to the tribes of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, Deut. iv. 2, binds them from altering God's inſtitutions according to their caprice, yet it by no means conveyed the idea that the Legiſlator himſelf was bound from adding or diminiſhing at his pleaſure, and as circumſtances ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. It would have been as ſinful in an Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diluvian to alter the then poſitive inſtitutions of God, as for a Jew in after days; and yet, it could not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nter into the heart of any Iſraelite, when God at Sinai enlarged this law of rites, to ſuppoſe that this formed an argument againſt the divine miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Moſes. It is now, as it always was, ſinful for any man, at his pleaſure, to alter the poſitive laws of God; but God himſelf is not bound in like manner. And of this abrogation of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaic inſtitutions the prophets appear to have predict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. See Jer. iii. where the prophecies evidently ſpeaking of the return of Iſrael from the preſent diſperſion. On their repentance, the promiſe is, ver. 14, 15, 16, <q>I will bring you to Zion:
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:028290_0075_0FD881A86D1BBAC0"/>And I will give you paſtors according to mine heart, which ſhall feed you with knowledge and underſtanding. And it ſhall come to paſs, when ye be multiplied and increaſed in the land, in thoſe days, ſaith the Lord, they ſhall ſay no more, The ark of the covenant of the Lord; neither ſhall it come to mind; neither ſhall they remember it; neither ſhall they viſit it; neither ſhall that be done any more.</q> The credentials of Jeſus, then, and theſe only, conſtitute the matter of enquiry; if they be valid, though he alter or abrogate the law of Moſes, he is yet a divine meſſenger. Chaſtity is a moral law; but whether a man ſhall be allowed a plurality of wives, or only one, as in the beginning; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſhall be permitted to divorce his wife for every cauſe, or for adultery only<note n="*" place="bottom">Some among the Jews underſtood the law of Moſes in Deut. xxiv. 1, as tolerating divorces only in caſes where a man found his wife guilty of ſome action which was really infamous, and contrary to the rules of virtue; others taught that the leaſt reaſons were ſufficient, as, if ſhe did not dreſs his meat well, or he ſaw a woman whom he liked better. The Phariſees who applied to Jeſus (Matt xix. 3) ſeem to have been of this latter opinion. No man of virtue will he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitate which doctrine to approve, that embraced by theſe Phariſees, or that taught by Jeſus Chriſt. Surely this is moſt agreeable both to the law of nature and the law of Moſes.</note>; or what ſort of puniſhment ſhall be inflicted on the incontinent, whether it ſhall be left to the deciſion of human laws, or whether God himſelf ſhall preſcribe a law to enforce puniſhment in this world, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the puniſhment in his own hand for a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtate, as in a thouſand other caſes, depends on his ſovereign pleaſure. If Jeſus Chriſt hath ſet looſe from moral obligations, or at all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged us to treat the righteous precepts of God ſlightly; if his credentials are no more than the ſigns and wonders of a juggling impoſtor, and he ſay, "Let us go after other gods;" then is
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:028290_0076_0FD881AA495753B0"/>there a good argument againſt his pretenſions, but not otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>As to your objection againſt receiving Jeſus as a Prophet, becauſe his diſcourſes are not call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>prophecies,</hi> it is void of all force; words are nothing. And as to the objection which you make to him, becauſe, as you ſay, he taught not in the name of God, it is founded in miſtake; turn to John v. 42 and 43: <q>I know you that ye have not the love of God in you. I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not.</q>—vii. 15, 18. <q>The Jews mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled, ſaying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned? Jeſus anſwered them and ſaid, My doctrine is not mine, but his that ſent me. If any man will do his will, he ſhall know of the doctrine whether it be of God, or whether I ſpeak of myſelf,</q> &amp;c.—And what though the Apoſtles went forth preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt, how does this operate againſt the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of the Chriſtian religion? What did they preach? that ſome god was to be worſhipped beſide the God of Abraham? No; they preached that God had raiſed Jeſus from the dead, and exalted him with his right hand to be a prince and a Saviour<note n="*" place="bottom">Acts v. 30, 31.</note>. With the <hi>Jews</hi> they reaſoned out of the ſcriptures, opening, and alledging that Chriſt muſt needs have ſuffered, and riſen again from the dead; and that Jeſus was the Chriſt<note n="†" place="bottom">Acts xvii. 2, 3.</note>.—The <hi>Gentiles,</hi> they taught to worſhip the one true God; and that, by Jeſus, whom he had raiſed from the dead, he would judge the world in righteouſneſs.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Acts xxii. 31.</note>—To <hi>all</hi> they preached that God was, in Chriſt Jeſus, reconciling the world unto himſelf. They went forth into the world, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming the fulfilment of that promiſe, <q>I will
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:028290_0077_0FD881ACEB01DF58"/>alſo give thee for a light of the Gentiles, that thou mayeſt be my ſalvation unto the end of the earth<note n="§" place="bottom">Iſa. xlix. 6, 7.</note>;</q> and that now was accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by the exaltation of Jeſus Chriſt, that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient prediction, <q>Thus ſaith the LORD, the Redeemer of Iſrael, and his Holy One, to him whom man deſpiſeth, to him whom the nation abhorreth, to a ſervant of rulers, kings ſhall ſee and ariſe, princes alſo ſhall worſhip, becauſe of the LORD that is faithful, and the Holy One of Iſrael, and he ſhall chooſe thee.</q> Thus they preached, that the God of Iſrael only was God, and that he who was crucified was his Chriſt.</p>
            <p>If Jeſus holds not a higher rank than any of the prophets, even than Moſes himſelf, I, with you, cannot ſee the propriety of his preaching in the language he often did. But, allowing him to be ſuperior not only to all prophets, but to angels themſelves, the true Meſſiah, him of whom Iſaiah ſpoke, when he ſaid, <q>Unto us a child is born, unto us a ſon is given, and the government ſhall be upon his ſhoulder, and his name ſhall be called Wonderful, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor, the Mighty God, the everlaſting Father, the Prince of Peace<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſa. ix. 6.</note>;</q> with this ſuperemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of character, he may preach himſelf, <q>The light of the world.</q> It is true, this is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance not to be paralleled in ſcripture; but, do not you Jews ſay of the Meſſiah, <q>He is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled above Abraham, above Moſes, above angels?</q> What wonder, then, as in his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter he hath no parallel, he ſhould deliver his doctrine in a manner peculiar to himſelf? The prophets foretold that he ſhould be given for a light of the Gentiles; he declares he is ſo. The majeſty of his doctrine is one proof, viewed in
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:028290_0078_0FD881ADC3B6AF00"/>connexion with others, that he is the perſon of whom the prophet ſpake, <q>Behold, my ſervant ſhall deal prudently, he ſhall be exalted, and extolled, and be very high<note n="†" place="bottom">Iſa. lii. 13.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>You ſay (p. 29 and 72) that before Chriſtians attempt to convert the Jews to Chriſtianity, they ſhould ſettle among themſelves what honours are due to Jeſus, and in what the work of ſalvation conſiſts; otherwiſe the Jews, among the variety of opinions which prevail, might be deterred therefrom, by reaſon of the difficulty attending the making a proper choice of that which is right. But, to the law, and to the teſtimony. It is not the creed of Athanaſius, or Arius, or Calvin, or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus, or Dr. Prieſtley, or of any body, which you are called to examine, much leſs to ſubſcribe. Our facred writings are open to you; what do they teach? and how do the doctrines there taught agree with the law and the prophets? Chriſtians differ in their explications of theſe writings, as do the Jews about theirs: examine them without regard to the opinions of others. What Mr. Lindſey or Mr. Romaine may have ſaid about Chriſtianity, or of what conſtitutes a Chriſtian, is of no more weight with the thinking, than any thing which may have been ſaid by the moſt obſcure. The ſacred writings are every thing in the queſtion before you.</p>
            <p>You ſay (p. 73) <q>Although the reformed churches, with the whole body of diffenters, are more charitable than the Catholies, yet, unleſs a perſon firmly believe the doctrine, and the merit of the blood and ſufferings of Chriſt, as the Meſſiah and Saviour of the world, there is no ſalvation for him.</q> This wants a little ſoftening, but ſuppoſe it did not, it is nothing to the purpoſe. Your buſineſs is
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:028290_0079_0FD881B10DC5C5A8"/>with the goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, and not with the goſpel of the church of Rome, of Geneva; of England, or of any other church; ſo that (p. 76) you are not called to forſake a religion given by God himſelf, for manifeſt contradictory opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; but to accede to that ſame true religion, brought to perfection by the appearance of the Meſſiah.</p>
            <p>As I dare ſay the goodneſs of your heart will have no objection, I will blot out the 30th page, and paſs on to what you advance reſpecting your preſent captivity.</p>
            <p>You endeavour to prove (p. 33 and on) that your preſent captivity is a continuation of the Babyloniſh; and that you now ſuffer for the ſins of your anceſtors previous to that period, which, you argue, they at their return never repented of, but in a partial way; that their chief matter of repentance was about the ſtrange women, and not for perſecuting the prophets. This is mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole nation, for the ſake of a favourite opinion, a body of hypocrites, and holding them forth as deficient in the moſt eſſential principle of true repentance—ſorrow for all ſin. This is making God to ſhew his approbation of a people who were wanting in the eſſential requiſite to true goodneſs, and who ſlattered him with hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical words. We cannot admit this idea for a moment, which is ſo reproachful to Iſrael, and ſo unworthy of God. In Nehemiah ix. 26, they confeſs the ſin of their fathers in ſlaying the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, who teſtified againſt them; and the great provocation which they wrought, for which they were delivered into the hands of their enemies. See alſo their confeſſions in the 34th and 35th verſes. And what did they do in teſtimony of their abhorrence of the deeds of their fathers? <q>They made a covenant, and ſealed it; and
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:028290_0080_0FD881B252A85A18"/>every one having knowledge and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, entered into a curſe, and into an oath, to walk in God's law, which was given by Moſes, the ſervant of God, and to obſerve and do all the commandments of the Lord<note n="*" place="bottom">Neh. ix. 38—x. 28, 29.</note>.</q> If this be not proof of ſincere and univerſal repentance, then no words are ſufficient to tell us what ſuch repentance is. There is no ground then, in the ſacred writings, for what you aſſert reſpecting your preſent captivity, as the ſame with the Babyloniſh, becauſe the ſins previous to that were not repented of; for as to your explication of Daniel's prophecy of the ſeventy weeks, in ſupport of your poſition, it appears to me to be forced to the laſt degree. My limits will not permit me to ſtay long on this article: I ſhall only obſerve, there is not that cloſe connexion between the prophecy contained in the 8th chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and this in the 9th, as you would perſuade us; nor does any thing appear in this chapter which might lead us to think that Daniel was now involved in any perplexity about the two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand three hundred days. It is Jeremiah's ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty years which gives occaſion to his prayer. The prophecy of the two thouſand three hundred days, was in the third year of Belſhazzar; this was in the firſt of Darius, a period of twelve or fourteen years diſtance.</p>
            <p>To ſee what falſe principles you go upon, in your application of the events and perſons here ſpoken of, you need only review your 58th page. <q>Know, therefore, and underſtand (that) from the going forth of the commandment to reſtore and build Jeruſalem, unto the anointed Prince (ſhall be) ſeven weeks. I have already,</q> &amp;c. You make this an aſſurance to Daniel, that ſo far would God be from prolonging the
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:028290_0081_0FD881B5D63D7758"/>ſeventy years ſpoken of by Jeremiah, that he would ſhorten them to forty-nine, the diſtance of time from the deſtruction of the firſt temple to Cyrus, who was the anointed prince. Read the text again; it is not <q>from the going forth of the commandment to deſtroy the firſt temple, unto the anointed Prince, ſhall be ſeven weeks:" but, "know, therefore, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that from the going forth of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment to reſtore and build Jeruſalem, unto the Meſſiah the Prince (or the Anointed Prince) ſhall be ſeven weeks and threeſcore and two weeks.</q> This needs no comment.</p>
            <p>Inſtead of thus perplexing the prophecy, as your ſyſtem obliges you to do, is it not more natural, and much more agreeable to the tenor of the prophecy, to ſuppoſe that the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment here refers to that of Cyrus, recorded in Ez. i. or of Artaxerxes, chap. vii. when they had leave to erect themſelves into a body politic; and the ſeven weeks (forty-nine years) as mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the time which it would take for perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their city and eſtabliſhment; ſixty-two weeks, (434 years) after which Meſſiah the Prince (who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he be) was to appear, and be cut off? This is certainly the moſt natural way of underſtanding the prophecy; for it muſt appear clear to every unbiaſſed reader, that the Meſſiah in the 25th ver. and the Meſſiah in the 26th, who is to be cut off, is the ſame perſon. And ſurely if this prophecy be conſidered diſpaſſionately, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with others which ſpeak of the Saviour who was to come, it muſt evidently appear a clear prediction, both of the time of his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and of his paſſion.</p>
            <p>In your ſecond letter (p. 67, and on) you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to compare the divine miſſion of Chriſt with that of Moſes. After hinting that the miracles
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:028290_0082_0FD87E31844A2CD0"/>which Jeſus wrought were ſuch as might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed without the immediate aſſiſtance of God, you proceed to prove, that Moſes was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by the Jewiſh nation merely for the miracles which he wrought, and that there was not only no ſuch great neceſſity for thoſe of Jeſus as for thoſe of Moſes, but that they were ſcarcely juſt or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, and that miracles only are not a ſufficient proof of a divine miſſion.</p>
            <p>Did Jeſus by a touch, by a word, by the mere efficiency of his will, heal all manner of diſeaſes, caſt out devils, and raiſe the dead? And do not ſuch works as theſe tranſcend all human power? It certainly lies upon you to prove, that he did not perform what is aſcribed to him, or to inform us how a human being can do ſuch things without the immediate aſſiſtance of God.</p>
            <p>You ſay (p. 83) <q>The miracles of Moſes were not the eſpecial proofs of his miſſion.</q> What paſſed at Sinai, it is true, was a more forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conviction than any of the other miracles, that he was divinely commiſſioned, and calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to make deeper impreſſions on the minds of the people; ſuch impreſſions as their rude ſtate required: but it does not hence follow, that the other miracles, which may be ſaid to be wrought more immediately by Moſes, if they were ſuch as no man could do unleſs God were with him, were not ſufficient to prove his divine miſſion. If he had done no more than what he did in Egypt, and at the red ſea, the people were bound to receive him as from God; the Lord thus judged when he gave him his miſſion, and endued him with thoſe powers<note n="*" place="bottom">Ez. iv. 1—9.</note>: the people thus judged, and followed him. That God gave them more brilliant proofs afterwards was from ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign pleaſure, and to anſwer his wiſe purpoſes:
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:028290_0083_0FD87E33057EB148"/>but it is never ſaid or intimated, that thoſe other miracles did not prove his miſſion. And we may obſerve, if thoſe miracles were not ſufficient to ſtamp upon their minds ſuch indelible proofs of his miſſion as to make them obedient to his laws, ſo no more was the appearance at Mount Sinai ſufficient to produce the effects you ſpeak of; for they did afterwards call in queſtion his divine miſſion; they again and again rebelled againſt him, and even before forty days were expired loſt the impreſſion of the one living God, and made a calf, and danced, and ſung, <q>Theſe are thy gods. O Iſrael.</q>
            </p>
            <p>As to there not being that neceſſity for the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of Jeſus as for thoſe of Moſes, whether it be ſo or not, it proves nothing. But ſuppoſe there <hi>were</hi> not that natural neceſſity here as in the caſe of dividing the ſea, yet was there not a moral neceſſity? It is a ſtrange ſort of reaſoning for a man to ſay in the caſe of Jeſus, or of any meſſenger from God, <q>This and that is not ſo neceſſary as the miracles of Moſes, and hence cannot be offered as proofs of their miſſion in compariſon of Moſes, and therefore I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject them.</q> The queſtion is not whether the miracles of Jeſus were as dazzling to the ſenſes as thoſe of Moſes, but whether they ſurpaſſed all power but that of God. True, to feed five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men, beſides women and children, with five loaves and two fiſhes; to open the eyes of one born blind, or to raiſe a man to life who had been dead three days, is not ſo tremendous as ſome of the miracles in Egypt; they do not make ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of terror as the thunder and lightning, and voice of trumpets, at Sinai; but do they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford leſs proof of divine miſſion? No unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced man can ſay they do. Your buſineſs is to prove, that the miracles aſcribed to Jeſus were
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:028290_0084_0FD87E1D66B8F6C0"/>not true and genuine, or all you ſay about neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or compariſon with Moſes, amounts to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. As is the caſe with your obſervations on Deut. xiii. 1. For before that text can operate againſt the miſſion of Jeſus, you muſt prove, that what are called his miracles were only the ſigns and wonders of a juggling impoſtor, and that he ſays, "Let us go after other gods."</p>
            <p>You particularly juſtify yourſelf in rejecting Jeſus as the Meſſiah (p. 67, and on) becauſe the credentials which he offers in proof of his miſſion bear no compariſon with the eſpecial proof of Moſes' miſſion, i. e. with the teſtimony which was given at Sinai. It is true, here is no thunder and lightning, and God ſpeaking from a fiery mountain (though nature bore awful teſtimony to the character of Chriſt when he died upon the croſs, and proof abounds that he roſe from the dead, and aſcended to heaven) but as you argue about neceſſity, permit a believer in Jeſus to do ſo likewiſe. There was not that neceſſity for ſuch appearances as thoſe at Sinai for the confirmation of the divine miſſion of Jeſus, as there was for that of Moſes. There (if I may ſo ſpeak) was laid the foundation of that ſtupendous ſuperſtructure which God meant to raiſe, the redemption of man, the ſalvation of the world. Thus his wiſdom choſe to aſcertain the beginnings of his work. This foundation laid, and ſanctified by the moſt ſolemn ſanctions of heaven, Moſes' miſſion is confirmed; all he wrote or taught is ratified; and that Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is from God is identified. In this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation a Saviour is made known, and his work prefigured; God's Anointed is promiſed; and through the ſucceſſive ſtages of prophecy predic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhine brighter and brighter, which give aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of his future appearance, and paint in the moſt glowing colours the glory of his perſon,
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:028290_0085_0FD881BA6C706B48"/>the dignity of his character, the offices he is to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and the work he is to perform. Yea, they tell us from what family he is to ſpring, in what town to be born, with a thouſand other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances intended to identify his perſon when he came. A meſſenger, whom all the Jewiſh na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion took for a prophet, announced his approach. He appears, makes known who he is, and to the ſublimity of his doctrine he adds miracles in proof of the divinity of his miſſion. He heals diſeaſes, he caſts out devils, he controls the elements, he riſes the dead, he bids them ſearch the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which teſtify of him, he claims their faith, and declares, <q>He that believeth in me ſhall never die.—If ye believe not that I am be, ye ſhall die in your ſins.</q> Though crucified, he riſes from the dead; and in proof of his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and aſcenſion to heaven, his diſciples perform miracles in his name, the truth of which the bittereſt enemies of Jeſus could not deny, even though the vice and prejudice of their hearts ſtirred up their paſſions to reſiſt conviction. What neceſſity for the terrors of Mount Sinai to be repeated here? Moſes and the prophets (the truth of whoſe words the thunders and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of Sinai have ratified) bore teſtimony to Jeſus as the Chriſt. And the works which the Father gave him to finiſh, he did; which works bear witneſs of him that the Father hath ſent him<note n="*" place="bottom">John. v. 36.</note>.

            </p>
            <p>Theſe remarks might be extended, by taking notice of ſome of the leſſes objections which you ſtate againſt the Chriſtian religion. Nor would it be difficult to demonſtrate the folly of that man who rejects Chriſtianity, becauſe he ſuppoſes
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:028290_0086_0FD881BBE86FCA98"/>he ſpies out ſome little matters, which lay i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. open to objection; but which bear no proportion to the great weight of evidence that preponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates in its favour. It might be ſhewn, that all which you can object to the two miracles which you have picked out of the goſpel hiſtory (p. 78) makes no more againſt the divinity of our ſcip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, than what an infidel (without conſidering the manners of the times, without allowing for probable attending circumſtances, and by the help of his diſtorting imagination) might alledge againſt the divinity of yours, from ſome detached facts culled out of them. Such an one might ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it unjuſt in the Iſraelites to ſpoil the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians<note n="‡" place="bottom">Exod. xii. 35, 36.</note>; he might fancy it "irrational" that—but let him fancy— <q>The juſt ſhall live by his faith<note n="§" place="bottom">Hab. ii. 4.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It might be ſhewn that your objection (p. 88) to the words Jeſus recorded, John v. 37, origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates in a wrong underſtanding, not only of this paſſage, but of that alſo in Exod. xxxiii. 11. Enquiry might be made after the proof, that the Jews in the days of Jeſus ſo underſtood the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty weeks of Daniel, as to know that their city and temple were to be deſtroyed, when they were, and which you produce (p. 86) for the purpoſe of ſetting aſide the evidence of Jeſus being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with the gift of prophecy. But this, and much more which might be ſaid, may be unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for me to enter upon, as my deſign in writing this letter was only to drop a few Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, and to thank you for favouring the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic with a ſtatement of your objections. If you will forgive my thus addreſſing you, and attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute it to the true motives which influence me, you will confer an obligation on a lover of all good men;</p>
