            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <bibl>DEUTERONOMY XIX. 19, 20.</bibl>
                  <p>So ſhalt thou put the evil away from among you. And thoſe which remain ſhall hear, and fear, and ſhall henceforth commit no more any ſuch evil a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you.</p>

               <salute>MY BRETHREN,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AN occaſion ſo melancholy as the preſent, viewed in all circumſtances, hath rarely, if ever, fallen under our notice. This numerous aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, of all orders and characters, will attend with reverence to the counſel that may be brought from the word of God. Eſpecially is it to be hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that <hi>he,</hi> whoſe tragical death is to ſucceed this ſolemnity, may be all attention to the laſt ſermon he will ever hear. I have ever conſidered that I preached to mortal men; but was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver called to preach to one doomed to death by public juſtice, and but a few hours before his launching into eternity.</p>
            <p>AN important end of capital puniſhment, as it relates to ſociety and this world, is pointed out in the words read. This comprehends ſundry par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars: It is to rid the ſtate of a preſent nui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance—to prevent the extenſion of the evil—to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim or preſerve thoſe who have been, or might be in danger of being, ſeduced by examples of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:022446_0004_0FB889BF1976EFA8"/>
profligate wickedneſs. <hi>So ſhalt thou put the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil away from among you. And thoſe which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſhall hear, and fear, and ſhall henceforth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit no more any ſuch evil among you.</hi> A further end of capital puniſhment will be attended to, as it is a natural conſequence from the words. This reſpects the offender, and a future world. Let us firſt attend to the former.</p>
            <p>WHAT is here ſaid with immediate reſpect to <hi>perjury</hi> is applicable to other crimes equally per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious in their tendency. The direction is to civil magiſtrates and judges, to make diligent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry reſpecting the evil; and upon proof of it, to put it away by the exciſion of the criminal. It is a duty which the civil guardians of a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity owe to God and their people. They are the miniſters of God, by him appointed "revengers to execute wrath upon ſuch as do evil." They may "not bear the ſword in vain." In being "a terror to evil works," they are miniſters of God for good to the community and its virtuous citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens.</p>
            <p>THE exciſion of a member of ſociety can be juſtified only for crimes of <hi>magnitude.</hi> It is put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a period, a reproachful and excruciating peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od, to the probation of a fellow-creature. A juſt and humane government will recur to it only in caſes where the ſovereign of life has declared his will, or the public ſafety clearly requires it. "A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the variety of actions which men are daily liable to commit, it is a melancholy truth," ſays judge Blackſtone, "that no leſs than an hundred and ſixty have been declared by act of parliament
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:022446_0005_0FB889C06D4EE080"/>
to be felonies without benefit of clergy; or, in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther words, to be worthy of inſtant death. So dreadful a liſt, inſtead of diminiſhing, increaſes the number of offences. The injured, through com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, will often forbear to proſecute: Juries, through compaſſion, will ſometimes forget their oaths, and either acquit the guilty, or mitigate the nature of the offence: And judges, through com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, will reſpite one half of the convicts, and recommend them to the royal mercy. Among ſo many chances of eſcaping, the needy or hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened offender overlooks the multitude that ſuffer; he boldly engages in ſome deſperate attempt to relieve his wants, or ſupply his vices; and, if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly the hand of juſtice over-takes him, he deems himſelf peculiarly unfortunate, in falling at laſt a ſacrifice to thoſe laws, which long impunity had taught him to contemn."<note n="§" place="bottom">Vol. 4. p. 18, 19.</note>
            </p>
            <p>SHALL crimes ſo different in their natures as murder and a trifling theft be ſubjected to the ſame penalty? Policy, juſtice and humanity alike re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate againſt it. "Death is of dreadful things the moſt dreadful. This terror ſhould be the laſt reſort of authority, the ſtrongeſt and moſt opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of prohibitory ſanctions, and placed before the treaſure of life, to guard from invaſion what can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be reſtored." It doth honor to the wiſdom as well as lenity of our legiſlators, that not more than ſix crimes are capital by our law.<note n="*" place="bottom">The lenity of government ſhould rather be expreſſed in <hi>framing</hi> of penal laws, than in ſuſpending or ſtopping the <hi>execution.</hi> Government is weakened by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexing to crimes ſuch penalties as are too ſevere to be executed. It is a preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive evidence of the wiſdom and lenity of our penal laws, of the juſt ſenſe our le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlators have of the rights of the ſubject, and the importance of life, that capital puniſhments are very rare with us. Inſtitutions, providing for the preſervation and employment of public criminals of various deſcription, have been found ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary in many ſtates.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:022446_0006_0FB889C1EBE07F88"/>THE execution of a capital ſentence ſhould e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be accompanied with circumſtances of ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity expreſſive of public grief, and adapted to make a laſting impreſſion on all ages, ranks and charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters—particularly on children and youth: Such ſolemnity will greatly ſubſerve the ſecurity of the ſtate, and the cauſe of morality.</p>
            <p>VARIOUS crimes were made capital by the jewiſh conſtitution, for peculiar reaſons which do not apply to other people. Nations are far from being agreed in the number of crimes which ſhould be puniſhed with death. The circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of different nations may require them to have recourſe to this puniſhment for different crimes. Nations in general have agreed to make murder, treaſon, and rape, capital. The divine legiſlator has expreſſly interpoſed his authority with reſpect to the firſt. And the reaſon aſſigned for the exciſion of a murderer equally applies to all times and people: It is this: <hi>For in the image of God made he man.</hi> The ſecond, or high treaſon, is murder increaſed, and extended to an whole community. The laſt is the crime for which this malefactor is to ſuffer death. It is beſide the intent of this ſolemnity to ſpecify all the crimes which the legiſlature and magiſtracy of a ſtate may be bound to put away by cutting off the perpetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. Such we ſuppoſe this malefactor's offence to have been. Seldom is <hi>ſuch</hi> an offence ſo am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply proved. For ſeldom is a delinquent of this deſcription ſo bold and ſhameleſs.</p>
            <p>IT is on all hands agreed that a private citizen may defend himſelf againſt a violent aſſault. The
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:022446_0007_0FB889C3DC3E06B8"/>
conſequence is plain, that a ſtate may defend her citizens againſt ſuch aſſault. When lenity to a criminal would be cruelty to good ſubjects, on what ground doth he expect lenity? The God of order hath veſted civil government with authority to preſerve itſelf—to provide for the perſonal ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and rights of every ſubject. He has command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the civil magiſtrate to put away any flagrant evil from the ſtate. If this can be done only at the expence of life, then life hath been forfeited to the ſtate. <hi>Raviſhment</hi> is ſuch an outrage on hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, an injury ſo great and irreparable, a crime ſo baneful and dangerous to ſociety, that civilized nations have agreed to protect female honor from violence by making death the penalty for this crime.</p>
            <p>THERE is a diſtinction between the forfeiture of <hi>liberty,</hi> and the forfeiture of <hi>life.</hi> But the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal whoſe atrocious conduct hath merited im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment for life, doth not differ materially in his moral character from one whom all will allow to have merited death. And whether one who hath wholly forfeited liberty can have a claim to life will admit a queſtion. In the inſtance before us, we proceed on the ſuppoſition that it is <hi>unſafe</hi> and <hi>dangerous,</hi> and therefore <hi>unfit,</hi> that ſuch an offender ſhould live. Thoſe who are ſo depraved in their moral character that they can neither be cured nor endured, are in the civil ſtate what a mortified member is in the natural body. As ſuch member muſt be amputated for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the body, ſo perſons of ſuch depravity muſt be cut off for the preſervation of the ſtate. The
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:022446_0008_0FB889C4ED7F3780"/>
maſter of a family expells from his houſe the member whoſe reſidence in it is no longer conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with its order and welfare. Should his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct as a citizen be equally vicious and dangerous, the like power in civil government muſt be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in ſentencing him to death—not to <hi>baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> If unworthy to live in his own country, he is equally unworthy to live in another. If he hath no rights in his own country, where hath he any rights? And what indignity to another nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to tranſport into it ſuch convict?</p>
            <p>ONE deſign of capital puniſhments then is to rid the ſtate of a preſent nuiſance, and protect good ſubjects. A further deſign is to <hi>warn</hi> and <hi>reſtrain</hi> others of evil diſpoſitions. That <hi>thoſe which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main</hi> may <hi>hear and fear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WITH this view the ſupreme ruler, in his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral government of the world, ſometimes evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſets forth individuals, and ſometimes commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, as an <hi>example</hi>—an example of his righteous ſeverity; and an admonition to the ungodly. You will readily call to mind various examples in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the judgments of God, final as to this world—inflicted with the parental deſign of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſenſible demonſtration of the malignity of vice, preventing the extenſion of it, and awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a juſt awe in the minds of many, who, were it not for ſuch admonitions, would proceed to commit all iniquity with greedineſs. Divine threatnings as well as judgments recorded in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are all parental warnings. The divine go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is a pattern to earthly rulers.</p>
            <p>SOME may imagine that puniſhment, eſpecially
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:022446_0009_0FB889C66C62CB00"/>
capital puniſhment, muſt be dictated by <hi>revenge.</hi> If only the caſe of the ſuffering individual came into conſideration, this might appear ſpecious. But government, from the nature of it, regards a public intereſt: It provides for particular parts or members in ſubordination and ſubſerviency to the good of the whole. Surely no individual can complain that his intereſt is not conſulted to the injury of any citizen—much leſs at the peril of the public. He cannot complain, that he, being of an abandoned character, is not ſpared to ſpread the contagion of iniquity. If righteouſneſs exalts a nation, and iniquity is its ruin, goodneſs requires that ſuch as would bring on this ruin be cut off. That muſt be a very bad adminiſtration under which any ſubject is permitted with impunity to aſſault his fellow-ſubjects, or to ſeduce them from their allegiance. That head of a family doth not conſider what he owes to his houſhold, who ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers any member of it to ſubvert all order, deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum and duty. Nor could we prove the moral rectitude and goodneſs of God, were he not known in the courſe of his providence by the judgments he execuſeth. Puniſhment is his ſtrange work. He delighteth in mercy. But if this doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim, he will whet his glittering ſword, and his hand will lay hold on judgment. Benevolence itſelf calls for puniſhment in this or an after ſtate, or there is no ſuch thing as moral government. In civil ſociety, the wicked would walk on every ſide, and the cry of the oppreſſed be in vain, the foundations would be deſtroyed, confuſion and miſery would prevail, were puniſhment, capital puniſhment, never executed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:022446_0010_0FB889C7EBDA9000"/>INGENUOUS motives are the beſt. But with how many have ſuch motives little or no influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? It would be well, could we, in inculcating morality, prevail with all by repreſenting the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs, excellence and advantages of virtue, the turpitude and miſery of vice. But we are compelled to perſuade men by the terror of future judgment, and future wrath. With this view the ſcriptures reveal future indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguiſh. Yet even the revelation of the wrath of God from heaven doth not reſtrain many. They do not believe, or do not fear, him who can deſtroy ſoul and body in hell. So in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to civil government, the <hi>love</hi> of it is the moſt worthy and ſure principle of obedience and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. But what courſe muſt be taken with thoſe who neither fear God, nor regard man? who are impatient of controul, and break through the reſtraints of all laws human and divine? who would diſſolve ſociety, and introduce univerſal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy? If ſuch would be the conſequence of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering them to live, they manifeſtly ought to die, that ſo great an evil may be prevented. Such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of public vengeance naturally ſtrike terror into others, whoſe luſts and paſſions might impel them to the ſame, or as great evil, were it not for this warning.</p>
            <p>THERE are but few who are made without fear. So awful and ſtrange a puniſhment eſpecially, as in a few hours awaits this poor priſoner, is calculated and deſigned to put the lawleſs in fear. On this occaſion perſons of all characters have come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Poſſibly there may be ſome in this great
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:022446_0011_0FB889CAED156990"/>
concourſe, who have been kept back from the ſame, or the like exceſs of riot, by no other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration than the fear of human laws. To ſuch eſpecially he is now ſet forth for an example, and will be in a yet more affecting manner in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon. Very few have ever been more harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and audacious offenders. Yet even he informs us, that when in the midſt of his career, one of his aſſociates was tried and condemned, he, with thoſe that remained, heard and feared. Well had it been, if they had taken warning, and committed no more any ſuch evil. But when they found that their companion, who met the juſt reward of his deeds, made no diſcovery of his accomplices, their fears vaniſhed, and they returned to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer courſe. Now another, perhaps the moſt bold and ſubtil of all, after having eſcaped the vigil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the civil magiſtrate in ſeveral kingdoms of Europe, is this day to be offered a victim to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic juſtice. From the paſt tenor of divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence towards ſuch offenders, the probability is, that none of them will die a common death, but that all will ſhare a ſimilar fate with this criminal. If even his heart failed him for fear, leſt his ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity ſhould be brought to light, how doth it now tremble? If this ſpectacle of human depravity and miſery ſhould prove a reſtraint to others from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting any ſuch evil, it will not be exhibited in vain. They themſelves will have reaſon to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the divine goodneſs in giving them this warning—a check will be put to ſuch evil in the ſtate. This example of wrath will praiſe God. It may be heard of in the kingdoms where the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:022446_0012_0FB889CC6CDFBB60"/>
priſoner long perpetrated the moſt flagitious crimes. It may be a means of bringing his confederates in vice to deſerved puniſhment, of detecting a band of villains, combined for the vileſt of purpoſes, and as dangerous to a community as the peſtilence that walketh in darkneſs. It may be a reſtraint to an horrible practice which hath long prevailed in Europe, and hath begun to prevail in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
            <p>BUT whether it may be preſumed or not, that this day's example may be thus extenſively known, and be followed with ſuch ſalutary conſequences; it is at leaſt adapted to reſtrain any of a like cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter who may be witneſſes, or hear of it. In this view its deſign is important to them, and to the community. If ſuch a warning ſhould not be hearkened to, it muſt argue ſtupidity and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in vice, which forebode ſpeedy deſtruction from God and man. Seldom is there ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, ſuch a warning, as the preſent. God grant it may not be an admonition unregarded by ſuch whoſe degeneracy makes it a needful one to them. What fruit of his paſt life hath this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned malefactor? The end is a premature, ſhameful and violent death. In full health and ſtrength, in early life, in a moment, on a gibbet, he is to be diſpatched into eternity. Compaſſion it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf calls for it—public compaſſion. I add, compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion alſo to ſuch as have entred on a vicious courſe, or may be in danger of being ſeduced. The priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner preacheth a better ſermon to ſuch than I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Look on him, ye who make a mock of ſin; hear, and fear. Behold, ye deſpiſers and wonder.
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:022446_0013_0FB889CE6034ACB8"/>
See an early wanderer from the path of good educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, an early deſpiſer of God and things ſacred, one who has had no awe of ſin and wrath, one who has ſported himſelf in the ſpoils of his fellow men, one who hath ſpeedily filled up his meaſure of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, one of whoſe untimely end you are to be witneſſes this day. Beware how you harden your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves after his example—ſtifle the checks of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience—hate inſtruction, and deſpiſe reproof— how you join yourſelves to company who are in the broad road to deſtruction. Such was the caſe with him who is now ſet before you as a warning. He hath been almoſt in all evil, and is going to appear before the judge of all, to give account of himſelf. Should he, in this ſituation, have a feared conſcience, what thought more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting!</p>
            <p>THIS reminds us of another end of capital pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment mentioned at the beginning of my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. It reſpects the <hi>offender</hi> and a <hi>future</hi> world, as the former reſpected ſociety and the preſent world. This is a conſequence from our ſubject. For crimes which call for ſuch ſeverity of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which render it dangerous to ſociety that the criminal ſhould any longer live on earth, muſt needs be as <hi>ſcarlet and crimſon,</hi> and call for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance deep in proportion. When nothing ſhort of death can expiate his crimes againſt his fellow-ſubjects or the ſtate, his puniſhment is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>final</hi> as to <hi>this</hi> world. But in this laſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity his ſoul is commended to the divine mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. What hath been ever uſual under our happy government, ought to be the uſage in all, to allow
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:022446_0014_0FB889CF6D3D63F0"/>
the convict a ſpace of repentance. To hurry him immediately from an earthly bar to the bar of God, (extraordinary caſes excepted) ſeems to argue want of ſenſibility and compaſſion. To give him op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to conſider, and give glory to God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he dies, is the united dictate of humanity, morality, and chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>THE ſituation of a condemned malefactor, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined and chained in a dark priſon, an emblem of the ſhadow of death, the day of his execution fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, muſt awaken reflection in one who is not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally abandoned. The providence of God intends it as a moral means of opening the ears to diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. By this means hath he ſealed the inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome. The natural horror of death, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional horror from the expectation of ſuch a peculiar kind of death, conduce to arreſt the mind with apprehenſions of eternal conſequences. Where ſome weeks are allowed between the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death and the execution of it, there is time for moſt ſerious conſideration and penitential ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. The mind is not thrown into ſuch agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as precludes ſober reflection. In the ſituation above ſuppoſed, the malefactor, whoſe mind is not exerciſed with other thoughts than thoſe of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral death, muſt indeed be hardened through the deceitfulneſs of ſin. The ſecond death, the wrath of an incenſed Deity abiding on him, the day of the lamb's wrath, the greater damnation for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neglected a great ſalvation, raiſe other appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions than temporal deſtruction. If the near view of the latter may be improved as a means of quickening him in flying from the wrath to come,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:022446_0015_0FB889D11DC46450"/>
in this caſe he that dies on a gibbet will have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be thankful that his wickedneſs was diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and met a merited puniſhment from public juſtice. The expectation of the deſtruction of the fleſh, through the operation of ſovereign grace is a means of ſaving the ſoul from death, and of hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a multitude of ſins. Such as "ſit in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and in the ſhadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron; becauſe they rebelled againſt the words of God, and contemned the counſel of the moſt HIGH;" have had their heart brought down—have cried unto the Lord in their trouble, and been brought out of worſe darkneſs than the dungeon of any priſon on earth—worſe chains than any outward ones have been broken.</p>
            <p>THE ſcriptures mention a thief who found mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on the croſs. But he was a <hi>penitent,</hi> not a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viler.</hi> There were <hi>two</hi> malefactors on the croſs at the ſame time. One of them railed on the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Redeemer, ſaying, "Save thyſelf and us." The other rebuked his fellow, ſaying, "Doſt thou not fear God, ſeeing thou art in the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation? And we indeed juſtly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds; but this man hath done nothing amiſs." He proceeded, and "ſaid unto Jeſus, Lord, remember me when thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt into thy kingdom. And Jeſus ſaid unto him, Verily I ſay unto you, To day ſhalt thou be with me in paradiſe." You ſee to whom theſe reviving words were ſpoken—to one who had indeed been a notorious ſinner in his life, was capitally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and brought forth to execution. But he was fully convinced of the enormities of his
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:022446_0016_0FB889D26BE555D0"/>
life, the juſtice of the puniſhment to which he was doomed, and feared the wrath of God more than that of man. His trial and priſon awakened his conſcience: He was reſigned to his deſtiny as what he had merited: He adminiſtred a moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent reproof to his companion in ſin, who with an air of levity, and with ridicule on his tongue, was ſuffering a capital puniſhment—ridicule point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the holy and juſt ONE, who was then endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the croſs to ſave mankind, and while he hung on the croſs prayed for revilers and murderers, "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do." In theſe circumſtances of ignominy, the other malefactor condemned himſelf, juſtified God, rebuked the reviler, bore teſtimony to the innocence of Jeſus, confeſſed him as the Chriſt of God, and was an earneſt, a ſucceſsful ſuitor for mercy. Whoever with like penitence and faith applies for mercy, ſhall find it, though at the laſt hour of life.</p>
            <p>BUT what encouragement doth this inſtance af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford to the unbelieving, unconcerned ſinner? what encouragement to one who laughs at deſtruction, and dies deriding Chriſt, inſtead of expreſſing hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble faith in him? All manner of ſin is forgiven for his ſake to the penitent. The groſſeſt ſinners have been waſhed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſanctified, and juſtified in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God. They who have <hi>much forgiven</hi> them, are ſenſible of the obligation, and <hi>love much.</hi> They are found weeping at the feet of Jeſus. Or with the prodigal, not while waſting his ſubſtance in riot; but when he came to himſelf, and reſolved, "I
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:022446_0017_0FB889D3EC36F840"/>
will ariſe, and go to my father, and ſay, Father, I have ſinned againſt heaven, and before thee." Or with the publican, who "would not lift up ſo much as his eyes to heaven, but ſmote on his breaſt, ſaying, God be merciful to me a ſinner." When great ſinners are thus overwhelmed with grief and ſhame; thus ſee the purity of God, and abhor themſelves; thus look to him whom they have pierced, and are in bitterneſs of ſoul, then may they have hope. For Jeſus was <hi>ſent to heal the broken hearted.</hi> The ſacrifices of God are a contrite ſpirit.</p>
            <p>BUT ſhall we talk wickedly and deceitfully for God? Shall we ſpeak comfortably, while the workers of iniquity boaſt themſelves? while they ſet themſelves againſt the Lord, and againſt his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed? while they think to out-brazen HIS wrath, at whoſe "preſence the mountains quake, and the hills melt, and the world and all therein are burnt? Who can ſtand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fierceneſs of his anger? Kiſs the Son, leſt he be angry, and ye periſh."</p>
            <p>THERE is danger, great danger, of miſapplying and perverting the grace of the goſpel. On the very favourable ſuppoſition of true repentance at the cloſe of a profligate life, there will not be the beſt evidence of the reality of ſuch repentance. Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity is not left to manifeſt the ſincerity and bring forth the fruits of it. There cannot then be the comfort and hope which is greatly to be deſired. There is not ſpace to efface, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of his repentance, the reproach which the delaying and preſumptuous ſinner hath brought on
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:022446_0018_0FB889D5DA093CC8"/>
the cauſe of Chriſtianity and of virtue. There is not time to undo what he hath done againſt God and his fellow-men.</p>
            <p>THESE things we obſerve on the favourable ſuppoſition of true evangelical repentance, after a life ſpent in vicious indulgence. But ſuch repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is rare. More generally thoſe who have deſpiſed the riches of God's goodneſs, forbearance and long-ſuffering till the cloſe of their days, go on ſtill indulging an hard and impenitent heart, treaſuring up wrath againſt the day of wrath: Some remarkable providence may, in a few inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, have rouſed open and flagitious ſinners from their ſecurity, ſo that a bad life may have ended well. But though this may be a reaſon why none ſhould <hi>deſpair,</hi> who have thus waſted life, is it not as forcible a reaſon why none ſhould <hi>preſume</hi> thus to waſte it? Would you thruſt forward the main buſineſs of life into the laſt day and hour of it? Yea, would you refer to your dying hour, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the whole buſineſs of life, but alſo the much more difficult buſineſs of reforming and renounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing habits of ſin and exceſs? Is not the natural bitterneſs of death enough, without the greater bitterneſs of ſin unrepented of, and uncancelled? Laden with an heavy load of guilt, which, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any additional load of infirmity, would he hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy enough, how will the ſinner, on the verge of eternity, ſupport his own reflections!</p>
            <p>WHATEVER aſpect any of the preceding re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections may have on ſuch as have lived without God in the world, and at the end of their days mourn thus, "How have I hated inſtruction, and
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:022446_0019_0FB889D6EC104218"/>
my heart deſpiſed reproof,"—whatever aſpect they may have on the ſtate of the unhappy man here before us; they are, I am perſuaded, the words of truth and ſoberneſs. However diſtreſſed we may feel for him, we may not, in this laſt inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him, hold up fallacious hopes; nor give countenance to others, who are warned by this example to <hi>hear</hi> and <hi>fear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>YET once more am I called to adddreſs you, <hi>Joſeph Mountain.</hi> No more will you hear the counſel of God from any of his miniſters. The bounds are ſet which you cannot paſs. <hi>The judge,</hi> your eternal judge, now <hi>ſtandeth before the door.</hi> This day, in about three hours, you muſt die— muſt be hanged as a ſpectacle to the world, a warning to the vicious. Had I not been very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly affected—were I not now eſpecially affected, with your ſituation, I ſhould be aſhamed of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as a man, more as a Chriſtian, and yet more as a Chriſtian miniſter. It is a weighty argument with us to warn the wicked, that we watch for ſouls as thoſe that muſt give account. If warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not given them, and they die in their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, their blood will be required at the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's hand. He is ſometimes ſent with this moſt melancholy meſſage, "Hear ye indeed, but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not; and ſee ye indeed, but perceive not." But this deſperate meſſage no ſpiritual watchmen may directly apply to any, unleſs divinely inſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and commiſſioned in an extraordinary manner. Our general encouragement to warn and reprove is this: "If any do err from the truth, and one
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:022446_0020_0FB889D86DA83798"/>
convert him; let him know that he who convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſinner from the error of his way, ſhall ſave a ſoul from death, and ſhall hide a multitude of ſins." Great ſinners may be reclaimed. With God all things are poſſible.</p>
            <p>SOME ſinners, if ſaved at all, are plucked as <hi>a brand out of the fire.</hi> And this, I am compelled to tell you, is the utmoſt we can hope concerning you. Had not the levity of your mind, during the firſt part of your impriſonment, prevented, I ſhould have choſen another text for the preſent melancholy occaſion. Since your confinement you have by no means given the beſt evidence of true contrition. Your circumſtances have called upon you, and Chriſt's miniſters have called upon you, to repent in duſt and aſhes—to eſcape for your life, to flee for refuge to Jeſus Chriſt, who ſaveth from ſin, and from the wrath to come. How many and fervent prayers have been offered for you in public and private? We have tried to perſuade ourſelves that you were a <hi>priſoner of hope,</hi> and have moſt affectionately warned and intreated you to <hi>turn to the ſtrong hold.</hi> And did I not think it at leaſt poſſible, that there may yet be mercy in ſtore for you, I ſhould hardly have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with your requeſt to preach to you this day. Unto you, therefore, I once more call. You are ready to be offered a victim to public juſtice. Wherefore, in the language of the holy Ghoſt, "TO DAY, if you will hear his voice, harden not not your heart."</p>
            <p>IF the hiſtory of your life, taken from your own mouth, and this day publiſhed, may be credited,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:022446_0021_0FB889DA61CC2150"/>
you have been almoſt in all evil for ſixteen years paſt; that is, ever ſince you were ſeventeen years old, and left your maſter's family. You have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally, and in company with others, been guilty of high-way <hi>robbery</hi> in about twenty inſtances; of <hi>burglary</hi> once at leaſt; of <hi>theft</hi> repeatedly; and for <hi>rape</hi> you are now to be executed. From rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery you have proceeded to <hi>gaming, riot</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch,</hi> and from theſe to robbery. How many have you ſeduced? How many have you ruined in their character and eſtate? From early youth to thirty three years you have lived in ſloth, diſſipati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, lewdneſs and violence. You have gone to and fro in the earth, as Satan your maſter, ſeeking whom you might devour. You have ſpent your days in contempt of every duty to God and your fellow-men, and gloried in your ſhame. You have merited the puniſhment you are now to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer more than twenty times. I ſay this on the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that you are ſuch a perſon as you have now told the world. If your hiſtory is falſe, your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravity is equally manifeſt. For then, as you go out of the world, you mock at the moſt preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ſins. You boaſt of <hi>pretended</hi> valor as a vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, in the moment of death. Yea, you die with an act of the deepeſt injuſtice to numbers of your fellow-men, whom you now accuſe of a confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy with you, for a number of years, in capital crimes. You ſtill perſiſt to affirm, that the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory you have given of your life is true in every particular. You can reap no advantage from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the world in which you are no longer to live. I ſhall therefore ſuppoſe that you have ſaid
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:022446_0022_0FB889DB6BCEC478"/>
the truth. Your paſt unprincipled and ſhameleſs character, and this only, can explain that apparent indifference to your ſtate, during a great part of your impriſonment, which hath aſtoniſhed us. Should you wiſh to leave behind you a character for ſkill and bravery as a thief or robber, a rioter in the ſpoils of your fellow-men—Should you now think of thus outbraving the wrath of the moſt HIGH, the laſt act of your life would be yet more preſumptuous than any or all your <hi>great tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</hi> God forbid that you ſhould harbour a thought of thus filling up the ſum of your wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs—that you ſhould thus with madneſs in your heart go down to the dead. Your name, crimes and puniſhment will be remembred, we hope, that others may hear and fear, and commit no ſuch evil. Though young in years, you are old in ſin.</p>
            <p>WERE a pardon from man this day offered, how would it affect you, while your heart is trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling for fear of the tragical death before you? But it is unſafe for the world that you ſhould live. You have lived a nuiſance on earth. You muſt therefore be executed. There is no reprieve for you. Yet a pardon from God is even now offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you, if you repent; otherwiſe you muſt periſh in a more deplorable ſenſe than is implied in the ſtrange puniſhment which awaits you. If deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction from man be a terror, deſtruction from God is much more. There is a world to come. There is an omniſcient, holy and righteous judge. The great Redeemer will be revealed from heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in flaming fire. Then ſuch as have trampled him under foot, ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:022446_0023_0FB889DCEEFDBD48"/>
deſtruction from his preſence. In that day ſuch will be the lively horror of hardned, but then too late awakened ſinners, that they will cry to the rocks and mountains to fall on them, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them from the face of the Lamb, whoſe wrath they have inflamed. Is it not now high time for you to "conſider this, leſt he tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver? The ungodly ſhall not ſtand in judgment, nor ſinners in the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the righteous." Of what vaſt moment then is it, that you "acquaint yourſelf NOW with him, and be at peace?" How have you improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſpace ſince you were tried and condemned at man's bar, in preparing to ſtand before the bar of the great judge of the world? I fear you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give a good anſwer to this queſtion. A few moments are yet left you. <hi>Who can tell but God may have mercy?</hi> There is plenteous redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him. Fall down before him in the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt contrition of ſoul. Own the juſtice of your ſentence. In the depths of diſtreſs cry to him, "Lord, ſave me; I periſh." Let free and ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign grace in the Mediator be your plea. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, be reconciled to God. I beſeech you as an ambaſſador of Chriſt, and in his ſtead, who made peace by the blood of his croſs; in whom all fulneſs dwells; who hath the words of eternal life; who hath the keys of hell and of death; who will come in glory, and call you and all mankind to account; who will pronounce the final ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, "Come ye bleſſed," or, "Depart ye curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed."—In his ſtead I beſeech you, for the laſt time, BE RECONCILED TO GOD.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:022446_0024_0FB889DE6C7EE650"/>My hearers, we have before us one, whoſe boaſt it has been, that he was pre-eminent in the ſkill and valour of an highway-man; who ſeems to have accounted this an honorable acquiſition, and hath blended with it, as the natural conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, various other, and equally atrocious crimes. The laſt, for which he is to ſuffer death, beſides its enormity in its own nature, was attended with circumſtances which ſhewed that he had caſt off all ſhame, and even all fear of detection; that he feared not the eye of the world any more than that of God.</p>
            <p>HE began his career of wickedneſs at or before <hi>ſeventeen.</hi> This is the moſt critical and danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtage of life. From this circumſtance, and this example, I may therefore very pertinently take occaſion to caution our <hi>young</hi> people againſt the follies and temptations to which their inexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and impetuoſity expoſe them. See in this inſtance of what moment it is to form early habits of virtue—to hear counſel, and turn at reproof— to ſhun the paths of vice. Happy the youth who "walketh not in the counſel of the ungodly, nor ſtandeth in the way of ſinners, nor ſitteth in the ſeat of the ſcornful." Small ſins lead to great ones. <hi>The beginning</hi> of a vicious courſe, as that of <hi>ſtrife,</hi> is like <hi>the letting out water.</hi> Wherefore "abſtain from all appearance of evil." Reſiſt the firſt ſolicitation, as he, "How can I do this great evil, and ſin againſt God?" Whenever tempted, allow time for this reflection, "Thou, Lord, ſeeſt me." "Can the ethiopian change his ſkin, or the leopard his ſpots? then may thoſe who have
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:022446_0025_0FB889DFEE2CB1A8"/>
been accuſtomed to do evil, learn to do well." How melancholy a comment on theſe words doth the preſent occaſion afford? When ſinners have aſſumed the boldneſs to leap over the boundaries of laws human and divine, they gradually loſe all tenderneſs of conſcience, and proceed from evil to evil. What is particularly ſaid of the iſſue of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful pleaſure, may be applied to any other vicious courſe: It is "the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death." We therefore beſeech thoſe who are yet young, by the ſorrowful example they here behold, that they forſake not "the guide of their youth; that they be not wiſe in their own eyes: Fear the Lord, and depart from evil." The choice they make, the courſe they enter upon in early youth, is of unſpeakable importance, both with reſpect to this world and another. Would to God that the preſent warning may not be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable one! that they may ſee the neceſſity and advantage of ſubmitting to ſalutary reſtraint, and truſt the wiſdom of their ſuperiors, inſtead of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what ſeemeth right in their own eyes. When the ſcorner is puniſhed, the ſimple is made wiſe.</p>
            <p>FURTHER, have any by falſe accuſation, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret fraud, or extortion, or otherwiſe, deeply in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured their fellow-men? They will do well to aſk, whether, in the view of the heart-ſearching God, they may not be as verily guilty concerning their brother, as thoſe who have injured him more groſſly, and are ſubjected to ignominious puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from civil government? Do the checks of conſcience, or force of human laws, or a ſenſe of public ſhame, reſtrain men from ſuch enormities
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:022446_0026_0FB889E1E491CD18"/>
as the priſoner hath been addicted to? And ſhould not the all-ſeeing eye of God reſtrain from all injuſtice to men? yea, from all ſin either againſt God, or man, or ourſelves? Should it not influence to keep the heart with all diligence? Do men take pains to ſave appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances? How much greater reaſon have they to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove themſelves to him who ſearcheth the reins and hearts; and will give to every man according to his works?</p>
            <p>MAY all who indulge vicious paſſions be warned by the event of this day. May the conſequences of idleneſs, gaming and diſſipation, of luſt and an ungo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned ſpirit, falſhood and greedineſs of gain, the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and eternal conſequences, be well conſidered. Theſe things impel men into courſes deſtructive of their peace, and of their ſouls. From ſmall beginnings they increaſe to more ungodlineſs. Tho' timid at firſt, they ſoon become capable of bold exploits, and prove veterans in vice. But few who enter theſe paths, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again. The few who do, find it extremely diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to tread back the wrong ſteps they have taken. The gains of vice are hard, perilous and momentary. The triumph of its votaries is ſhort. They travel with pain all their days. They know not the way of peace, becauſe they fear not God. Their own counſel caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them down. "The heaven ſhall reveal their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and the earth ſhall riſe up againſt them. They ſhall be driven from light into darkneſs, and chaſed out of the world. The Lord's throne is in heaven. His eyes behold the children of men. He trieth the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; but the wicked and him that loveth violence his ſoul hateth. Upon the wicked he ſhall rain ſnares, fire and brimſtone, and an horrible tempeſt: This ſhall be the portion of their cup." But <hi>the fear of the Lord is a fountain of life, to depart from the ſnares of death.</hi>
