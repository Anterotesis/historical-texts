            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>WHEREAS the infatuated multitudes of royal Neronian dependants, catamites, pimps, and paraſites, too many to be enumerated; have long conducted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as parricides and traitors in a fatal progreſſion of crimes againſt the conſtitutional liberties of the Britiſh empire, and have at length proceeded to avowed and open rebellion againſt the laws of the land, and the lives of Engliſhmen in England and America, and the good effects which were expected to ariſe from the patience and lenity of the people, have been often fruſtrated, and remonſtrance proved ineffectual and now rendered hopeleſs, from the obſtinacy and cruelty of the ſovereign, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of their infernal counſels, and confederacy, it only remains for the people, who have the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power, as well for the puniſhment of thoſe guilty parricides, as for the protection of the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, to prove they do not bear the ſword in vain.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="230" facs="unknown:013994_0002_0F92592CA0AAB390"/>
The infringements which have been committed upon the ſacred rights of Magna Charta, and the people of Great-Britain and America, are too many to enumerate on one fide, and all too attrocious, too infamous, and too diabolical to be palliated on the other. All unprejudiced, unpenſioned, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed Engliſhmen, who have been witneſs, (or even heard) of the late tranſactions, in this kingdom and America, will find, upon a tranſient review, marks of premeditation and conſpiracy to deſtroy the conſtitution of the Britiſh empire, that would juſtify the fullneſs of chaſtiſement; and even thoſe who are leaſt acquainted with facts, cannot fail to receive a juſt impreſſion of the enormity, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as they diſcover the arts and aſſiduity, by which their bloody deſigns have been falſified and concealed. Thoſe parricides, the authors of the preſent bloody meaſures and unnatural revolt from the laws, never daring to truſt their cauſe, or their actions, to the judgment of an impartial public, or even to the diſpaſſionate reflection of their followers and adherents, have uniformly placed their chief confidence in the ſuppreſſion of truth; and while indefatigable and ſhameleſs pains have been taken to deſtroy the real intereſt of the people of England and America, the groſſeſt forgeries, calumnies, and abſurdities, that ever inſulted human underſtanding, have been impoſed upon their credulity, by the King, and thoſe miſcreants. The Preſs, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed appendage of public liberty, and when fairly and impartially employed, its beſt ſupport, has been invariably proſtituted by thoſe penſioned raſcals, Hume, Johnſon, Kelly, Shebbeare, and other miniſterial hirelings, to the moſt contrary
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:013994_0003_0F92592D40A632E0"/>purpoſes. The animated language of ancient and viriuous times, calculated to vindicate and promote the juſt rights and intereſts of mankind, have been applied by the King's minions, to countenance the moſt abandoned violations of thoſe ſacred bleſſings and not only from the flagitious miniſterial prints, but from the ſlaviſh harangues of proſtituted Peers, and venal Senetors, men have been taught to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon activity in ſhedding of blood, for the ſecurity of their places, penſions, and perſons, till to complete the horrid profanation of terms and of ideas, the name of God has been introduced in addreſſes and in the pulpit, by a groupe of rotten Popiſh Biſhops, to excite devaſtation and maſſacre.</p>
               <p>The minds of men, ſuch as Gage, Percy, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goyne, Clinton, and Howe, and the King's mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary ſoldiers, having been thus gradually prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for murder, a number of armed troops to the amount of eighteen hundred, and upwards, on the 19th of April laſt, at Concord, cowardly attacked about ſixty peaceable Americans, who not expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo conſumate an act of ſavage barbarity, unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for vengeance, and willing to decline it, made uſe of their arms only in their own defence. Since that period, the mercenaries, deriving confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence from impunity, have added inſult to outrage; have repeatedly fired upon, and barbarouſly killed many of their fellow ſubjects with cannon and ſmall arms; and with a prepoſterous parade of military arrangement, they try to frighten, and mean if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to enſlave America, while part, of their body make daily and indiſcriminate invaſions upon private property, and with a wantonneſs of cruelty, peculiar in this reign, and ever incident to lawleſs power,
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:013994_0004_0F92593137F55528"/>carry depradation and diſtreſs where ever they turn their ſteps. The action of the 19th of April, and the cruel, bloody, and inhuman circumſtances at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that day's carnage, are of ſuch notoriety, as muſt baffle all attempts to contradict them; and the flames of buildings, the cries of helpleſs infirm old men, women and children, wantonly ſlaughter'd in cold blood, ſpread, and will for ever ſtand a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy confirmation of the ſubſequent aſſertions.</p>
               <p>In this exigency of Neronian cruelty and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated calamities I avail myſelf of the laſt efforts within the bounds of my duty, as a peaceable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, to ſpare the effuſion of blood; to offer, and I do hereby, in the name of the whole people of England and America, offer and promiſe a moſt gracious pardon, to all the mercenaries who ſhall forthwith lay down their arms, and return to the duties of peaceable ſubjects and faithful Engliſhmen, loyal to the laws and the conſtitution, excepting only from ſuch pardon, John Stuart, Earl of Bute, and William Lord Mansfield, the authors and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters of bloodſhed and cruelty, whoſe crimes are of too flagitious a nature to admit of any other conſideration than that of condign puniſhment.</p>
               <p>And to the end that no perſon within the limits of this proferred mercy may plead ignorance of the conſequences of refuſing it, I by theſe preſents pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim not only the perſons above named and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, but alſo their adherents, aſſociates, and abettors, meaning to comprehend in thoſe terms, all and every perſon and perſons, of what claſs, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination, or deſcription ſoever, who have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in arms againſt the ſacred laws and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Britiſh empire, and ſhall not lay down
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:013994_0005_0F925932A801DDF8"/>the ſame as aforeſaid; and likewiſe all ſuch as ſhall ſo take up arms after the date hereof, or who ſhall in any wiſe protect or conceal ſuch offenders, or aſſiſt them with money, proviſions, cattle, arms, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, carriages, or any other neceſſiry for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence or defence, or ſhall hold ſecret correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with the mercenary murderers, by letter, meſſage, ſignal, or otherwiſe, to be rebels and trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to the Britiſh couſtitution, and as ſuch to be treated.</p>
               <p>And whereas, during the continuance of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent bloody and unnatural civil war in America, juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice cannot be obtained by the common law of the land, the courſe whereof has for a long time paſt been violently impeded, and wholly interrupted by the King and his paracidial minions and military cut throats, from whence reſults a neceſſity, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to preſerve the dear bought rights of Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and hallowed conſtitution of the empire, for uſing and exerciſing the Lex Talionis or Law of Retaliation; I have therefore thought fit by the authority inveſted in me by Magna Charta as a Freeman, to publiſh, and I do hereby publiſh, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim, and order the uſe and exerciſe of the Lex Talionis, or Blood for Blood, within and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Great-Britain and America, ſo long as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unhappy occaſion ſhall neceſſarily require, till the ſons of freedom ſhall gain a deciſive victory over tyranny and lawleſs power, till each parricide and traitor ſhall be brought to the block or the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, or otherwiſe fall a ſacrifice by the hands of a much injured and enraged people, and till the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of England and America are ſettled upon a ſure and laſting foundation, not to be again ſhaken
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:013994_0006_0F92593341380300"/>by any tyrant of the houſe of Brunſwick; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of all true Engliſhmen are hereby required to take notice, and arm themſelves—with a reſolution as well to maintain their rights, as to reſiſt, encounter and ſubdue the mercenaries and traitors above deſcribed.</p>
               <p>To theſe inevitable, but I truſt ſalutary meaſures, it is of a far more pleaſing part of my duty to add the aſſurances of protection and ſupport to all who in ſo trying a Criſis ſhall manifeſt no allegiance to tyrants, but an affection for the ſacred conſtitution of their country; So that ſuch perſons as may have been induced to join in the preſent royal and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial meaſures for deſtroying the laws, liberties, and lives of their fellow-ſubjects in America, may return to their reſpective callings and profeſſions, be no longer the inſtruments of murder and public ruin, but ſtand diſtinct and ſeparate from the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricides of the conſtitution, till God in his mercy ſhall turn the hearts of tyrants, and reſtore peace to this diſtracted land, now polluted with innocent blood.</p>
