            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Author of the following little Piece is ſenſible of its numerous defects—it was got up in a hurry, and under many diſadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. The very flattering marks of approbation, however, with which it was received, together with the preſſing importunities of many friends, have led him to ſuppoſe that a publication of it would not be unpleaſing.</p>
            <p>To the generous Patrons of the Drama, and to the worthy Sons of Columbia who feel an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the welfare of the American Stage, the <hi>YORKER'S STRATAGEM</hi> is moſt reſpectfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated: and the Author is not without hopes, that this feeble attempt, defective as it is, will meet an apology from every generous heart for its introduction into the world.</p>

                     <p>Well, this makes good the old ſaying, that a true bred Yankey is a match for the devil:—But you'll find yourſelf miſtaken in her fortune—I have large demands againſt the eſtate.</p>

                     <p>You find, Sir, from your ungovernable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of riches, you not only put people upon their guard againſt you, but oblige them to deſcend to the loweſt arts, to defeat you in your villainy. To ſuch a degrad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtate of infamy did you lower yourſelf, that you made even your wife and child abhor you as a monſter that knew no diſtinction of either appetite or ſentiment: that abhorrence gave riſe to inconſtancy in the one, and diſobedience in the other. The only atonement you can now make for your paſt errors, is to return to the paths of honour and honeſty, and by your endeavours to make your family happy, be reinſtated in their loves.</p>

                     <p>Your words are backed with truth and ſound reaſon, and I'm become their convert. I humbly beg pardon for the trouble I have given you: But if you and this good company will bury in oblivion my paſt errors, and thoſe of the YORKER'S STRATAGEM, I ſhall for the future only exiſt in meriting your—no—
