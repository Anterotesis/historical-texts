            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <salute>MY FELLOW-CITIZENS,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>THE preſent very critical ſituation of things in this country, in which you have ſo much at ſtake, and in which it cannot be denied that you have conſiderable weight, is a ſufficient apology for an addreſs to you with reſpect to it. The approaching election for members of parliament calls for <hi>all,</hi> and perhaps for the <hi>laſt</hi> efforts of the friends of liberty in this country; and every real friend of this great cauſe among us, who is acquainted with the hiſtory of your anceſtors, will naturally look to you for the moſt active concurrence and ſupport.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Religious liberty,</hi> indeed, is the immediate ground on which you ſtand but this cannot be maintained except upon the baſis of <hi>civil liberty;</hi> and therefore the old Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:013556_0004_0F90F6963101CAA8"/>
and Nonconformiſts were always equally diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed for their noble and ſtrenuous exertions in favour of them both. Their zeal in this cauſe, and the valuable effects of it, are ſo well known, that even Mr. Hume (an hiſtorian of the moſt unſuſpected impartiality in this caſe) acknowledges, that whatever civil liberty we now enjoy is to be aſcribed to them. In fact, all our princes, who have ever entertained deſigns upon the liberties of their ſubjects, have been jealous of your principles and influence, and have accordingly uſed their firſt and utmoſt efforts to cruſh you.</p>
               <p>THE race of the Stewarts felt that they could not riſe except by your fall: but, fortunately your riſe and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment ended in their extermination. The Tory miniſtry, which prevailed at the end of the reign of Queen Anne, naturally enough began their attempts to reſtore the Pretender and arbitrary power by hoſtilities againſt you: and nothing but the moſt ſeaſonable and providential death of that unhappy and miſguided prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs ſaved you with your country. And<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> laſtly, to come to the preſent times, that thoſe who actually guide the meaſures, which are now carrying on in this country, are equally enemies to civil liberty and to you, can no more be denied, than that William the IIId. of glorious memory, and the two firſt princes of the houſe of Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, were friendly to both. Be aſſured, that your pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar privileges, and the general liberties of this country, are inſeparably connected, and that whenever the altar of civil tyranny ſhall be erected, you will be the firſt victims. As, therefore, you value the one, contend for the other.</p>
               <p>WHAT was it but the tricks and artifices of the court, and the influence of the biſhops, who have the ſame views and intereſt with the court, that fruſtrated your late attempt to procure the repeal of but part of
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013556_0005_0F90F696EB9034D8"/>
the many laws which bear hard on you, and the rights of humanity. The laws themſelves are ſo repugnant to common ſenſe and common juſtice, that even your moſt violent enemies could not but ſay, that <q>no man could find in his heart to put them in execution.</q> The equity of your bill twice carried it with eclat through the houſe of commons; but all was blaſted by a nearer approach to the throne, a throne from which mercy is extended to <hi>papiſts</hi> and <hi>rebels,</hi> becauſe friends of deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and even to <hi>murderers,</hi> if they be employed againſt the conſtitution of the country.</p>
               <p>IT was by the artifices of courtiers that you were at firſt perſuaded to believe that the preſent miniſtry wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed well to your application: But by them you were even then ſo far deceived, as to be perſuaded to clog it with <hi>a declaration,</hi> which, beſides making it leſs acceptable to many among you, and intolerable to ſome, made it eaſy for the biſhops to defeat the whole purpoſe of it.</p>
               <p>WHAT can more plainly ſhew the inſidious and hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile intentions of the court, than the diſgraceful hiſtory of your <hi>late tranſactions</hi> with reſpect to the ſame applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Was it not by courtiers that a majority of the members of your own committee were prevailed upon to drop the ſolicitation of the bill, at the only time when there was a proſpect of its ſucceſs, <hi>viz.</hi> before the diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of a houſe of commons peculiarly friendly to you? Circumſtances ſpeak too plainly to deny this, when it is known that all who gave the deciſive and fatal vote were thoſe who diſtribute the <hi>regium donum,</hi> except one, who is known to be particularly acquainted with ſome mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial perſons, a man of a weak and timid nature, and therefore peculiarly unfit to take the lead in a buſineſs of this kind. One miniſterial tool, and falſe brother, is even ſaid to have had the aſſurance to promiſe the miniſtry, that they ſhould have no diſturbance from the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:013556_0006_0F90F69AEFE88AA8"/>
diſſenters this year. Does not the painful recollection of theſe things ſtimulate you to do ſomething to wipe off your diſgrace?</p>
               <p>THE meaſures that are now carrying on againſt the North American colonies are alone a ſufficient indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the diſpoſition of the court towards you. The <hi>pretence</hi> for ſuch outrageous proceedings, conducted with ſuch indecent and unjuſt precipitation, is much too ſlight to account for them. The <hi>true cauſe</hi> of ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent animoſity muſt have exiſted much earlier, and deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. In ſhort, it can be nothing but the Americans (particularly thoſe of New England) being chiefly <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters</hi> and <hi>whigs.</hi> For the whole conduct of the preſent miniſtry demonſtrates, that what was <hi>merit</hi> in the two late reigns, is <hi>demerit</hi> in this. And can you ſuppoſe that thoſe who are ſo violently hoſtile to the <hi>offspring</hi> of the Engliſh diſſenters, ſhould be friendly to the remains of the <hi>parent ſtock?</hi> I truſt that both you and they will make it appear, that you have not degenerated from the principles and ſpirit of your illuſtrious anceſtors, and that you are no more to be outwitted or overawed than they were.</p>
               <p>IT is ſaid, that a great part of the reſentment of the court againſt the diſſenters has ariſen from a notion that they were the chief abettors of <hi>Mr. Wilkes;</hi> and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that, in general, they were the friends of his <hi>cauſe,</hi> becauſe it was the cauſe of liberty, and of the conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But they took no part in this buſineſs more than the other friends of this country: except that diſſenters, having more depending upon public liberty, are more intereſted to keep a watchful eye upon every thing that relates to it. So that if your conduct in this affair has given <hi>peculiar</hi> offence, it muſt have been becauſe the ſame conduct appears more offenſive in you than in any others; which implies a prejudice againſt you <hi>as diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
                  <pb n="9" facs="unknown:013556_0007_0F90F69C66D74490"/>
of which you ought to be appriſed, that you may act accordingly.</p>
               <p>DO not imagine, however, that what I have hitherto ſaid is a preamble to a declaration of war, or that I wiſh you to take arms in defence of your liberties, as your brethren in America will probably be compelled to do. That were equally ineffectual, and improper. But it is moſt earneſtly to be wiſhed, that you would exert your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in doing what the conſtitution of your country both permits, and <hi>requires</hi> of all good citizens. Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully avoid all undue influence on the approaching elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, and ſtrenuouſly exert yourſelves to procure a return of men who are known to be friends to civil and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous liberty.</p>
               <p>ATTEND particularly to the characters of the ſeveral candidates for whom your votes are requeſted. Regard none of their <hi>profeſſions</hi> of zeal for the public ſervice, but look to their paſt <hi>conduct;</hi> and if, in any caſe, they have promoted the corrupt meaſures of the court, and have concurred in paſſing any of the late laws that are unfavourable to your liberties, be not acceſſary to their <hi>future crimes,</hi> by giving them another opportunity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying you, and acting the ſame part over again. More eſpecially avoid, as you would the peſtilence, every man who voted againſt the repeal of the oppreſſive laws to which you are expoſed, and take every proper method of expreſſing your juſt ſenſe of their enmity towards you. Conſider them as the declared enemies of liberty, juſtice, and humanity.</p>
               <p>THE conduct of the <hi>Quakers</hi> is ſaid to be peculiarly chaſte and exemplary with reſpect to elections. They join as a body to diſcountenance all undue influence, and admit not the ſmalleſt favour, or hardly a civility, from thoſe for whom they give their votes. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:013556_0008_0F90F69D965B9260"/>
you cannot too carefully avoid all ſuſpicion of corruption in a buſineſs of ſo much importance, and where freedom and independence of mind are ſo much concerned.</p>
               <p>THE popular cry againſt members of parliament is, that they are <hi>corrupt,</hi> ſubſervient to all the meaſures of the court; and that, in fact, they <hi>ſell</hi> their conſtituents. But is it really any wonder that a man ſhould <hi>ſell</hi> what he is known to have bought and paid for? Inſtead of making the office a matter of favour, honour, and truſt, is it not made exceedingly burthenſome and expenſive to them? and is this an age in which a man can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be at very great expences, without endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to reimburſe himſelf? There <hi>are</hi> characters ſo truly diſintereſted and great. I could name ſeveral ſuch; but, certainly, it were abſurd to expect they ſhould be found every where.</p>
               <p>IF then you would have it in your power, with any face and decency, to call your conſtituents to account, or even upbraid them for ſacrificing your liberties <hi>in</hi> the houſe, do not oblige them to ſacrifice their fortunes in order to get thither. Have no demands upon them <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> they enter upon their office, that you may have the more <hi>afterwards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AN eminent foreigner has foretold, that <q>England will loſe its liberty, whenever the legiſlative part of the conſtitution ſhould be more corrupt than the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive.</q> But he had no occaſion to have ſaid ſo much. Our liberties muſt neceſſarily be gone, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the power of the houſe of commons ſhall be united to that of the crown, whether the court be corrupt or not. For how can there be any <hi>equilibrium,</hi> when every weight is thrown into one ſcale. But he might have ſaid farther, and more to my preſent purpoſe, that the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:013556_0009_0F90F69DB6431918"/>
houſe of commons will loſe its liberty and independence whenever the <hi>electors</hi> ſhall be more corrupt than the <hi>elected.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IF, therefore, you wiſh that your repreſentatives be uncorrupt and independent, firſt ſhew them the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of being ſo yourſelves. This ſtep is certainly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in order to gain your point, though it will not abſolutely inſure it. The diſeaſe may perhaps be too deſperate for any power of medicine; acquit yourſelves however of all juſt blame, by applying all ſuch as are of approved efficacy. This conduct will at leaſt miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the evil, and make you the objects of compaſſion in your ſufferings.</p>
               <p>THE diſeaſes of our conſtitution are too many to yield to any remedy, while the court has ſo much to give, and ſo many lucrative places to diſpoſe of; ſo that it is to be feared, that though your members be ſent to parliament in the moſt uncorrupt and honourable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, they will not long continue uncorrupt. It is too much to be expected of human nature, eſpecially in this luxurious and expenſive age.</p>
               <p>THE radical fault is in the adminiſtration of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues. If this were in proper hands, and managed with propriety and frugality, ſo that no part of it, and no <hi>place</hi> created by it, ſhould come into the hands of your repreſentatives; or if the multitude of places were reduced to ſuch only as are neceſſary, and their enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous emoluments to a mere equitable payment for ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice done, it could not be made the intereſt of your ſervants to betray you; and they would then make your intereſt their own, becauſe there would be no other to come into competition with it.</p>

                  <pb n="12" facs="unknown:013556_0010_0F90F69E7077CE70"/>BUT though an effectual remedy may not be found, a palliative may be adminiſtered, which may abate the virulence of the diſeaſe, and procure time for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of ſomething more efficacious. Though you cannot remove every temptation to which your repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives are expoſed, becauſe many of them ariſe <hi>from others,</hi> at leaſt remove all thoſe that depend upon your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. However they may be influenced to betray your intereſt <hi>after</hi> their return to parliament, let them not have it in their power to excuſe their conduct by any neceſſity laid upon them <hi>antecedent</hi> to their being returned.</p>
               <p>THERE is the more reaſon why we, in England, ſhould watch with care and jealouſy over the remains of our civil liberty, becauſe the ſtate of the reſt of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope is ſo extremely critical and alarming in this reſpect. In no part of the world was there ever ſuch a ſcene of revolutions as there has been in this. Power has ſhifted and fluctuated in a moſt extraordinary manner among the different ranks of men, <hi>people, lords, clergy,</hi> and <hi>princes:</hi> But, after almoſt all the modes and combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of which the diſtribution of power is capable, it has at length almoſt wholly, and every where, reverted to the princes: ſo that they are nearly as arbitrary in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope as in the Eaſt, though eſtabliſhed maxims and cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms (from which reſults, what we call <hi>the ſpirit of the times</hi>) have hitherto prevented their giving into ſo wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton an <hi>abuſe</hi> of their power. But a longer continuance in power may be attended with theſe exceſſes; as was the caſe with the Romans.</p>
               <p>IN their inſtructive hiſtory, we ſee as brave and as high-ſpirited a people as the Engliſh, tamely ſubmitting to ſo vile an abuſe of power, as one would have thought, <hi>a priori,</hi> had been abſolutely impoſſible among men; indeed ſuch as nothing in the ſhape of men could be
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:013556_0011_0F90F69F30BED608"/>
trained to bear. And why may not this be the caſe with us? We have already taken the <hi>firſt ſteps</hi> towards it in the corruption and venality of the lower ranks of the people. Had not they been needy, profligate, and will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſell themſelves, Sylla, Caeſar, or Auguſtus had never been their maſters.</p>
               <p>SUCH, however, is the face of Europe, in all the ſtates of which the princes were, originally, the fartheſt in the world from being arbitrary, that they are now almoſt univerſally ſo. Indeed, not one who bears the name of <hi>king</hi> is excepted, beſides that of Great Britain. And when things ſhall be equally ripe for it, who can tell but that by a revolution as ſudden as that of Denmark, or more lately that of Sweden, the very <hi>forms</hi> of our free conſtitution may be ſet aſide at once, and undiſguiſed deſpotiſm take place. It is no diſparagement to the Engliſh to ſay that they are not more brave or indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent than the Swedes, and it is cerainly not ſaying leſs than the truth, of our princes, to affirm, that like the kings of Sweden, they are <hi>men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>SUPPOSING now the three powers of Ruſſia, Pruſſia, and Auſtria to have completed the partition of Poland, in which they have already made conſiderable progreſs; nothing will remain but the much-eaſier work of ſimilar partition of the ſtates of Switzerland, and of the United Provinces, and deſpotiſm will appear without controul over all the continent of Europe. And ſhall we flatter ourſelves that theſe iſlands will then remain a ſanctuary for the ſons of freedom, and not (after having been the ſpectators of the progreſs of arbitrary power abroad) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the laſt and moſt dreadful ſacrifice to it?</p>
               <p>THE hope of mankind (who have been ſo long debaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and trampled upon by forms of unequal government) is that, in time, this horrible evil may find its own anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:013556_0012_0F90F69FF5776C78"/>
and cure. Kings being always worſe educated than other men, the race of them may be expected to dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, till they be little better than ideots, as is the caſe already with ſeveral of them, needleſs to be named, and it is ſaid will be the caſe with others, when the preſent reigning princes ſhall be no more; while thoſe that are not the objects of <hi>contempt,</hi> will be the objects of <hi>hatred and execration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN this ſituation, the temptation to men to aſſert their natural rights, and ſeize the invaluable bleſſings of freedom, will be very great. And it may be hoped that, enlightened as the world now is with reſpect to the theory of government, and taught by the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of ſo many paſt ages, they will no more ſuffer themſelves to be transferred, like the live ſtock of a farm, from one worn out royal line to another, but eſtabliſh every where forms of free and equal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; by which at infinitely leſs expence than they are now to be <hi>oppreſſed</hi> and <hi>abuſed.</hi> every man may be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured in the enjoyment of as much of his natural rights as is conſiſtent with the good of the whole community. If this ſhould ever be the caſe, even the paſt uſurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Pope</hi> will not excite more aſtoniſhment and indignation, than the preſent diſgraceful ſubjection of the <hi>many</hi> to the <hi>few</hi> in civil reſpects.</p>

Britiſh empire, it were greatly to be wiſhed that their ſucceſſors might learn by their example to know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves better, and keep within their proper province. This is a buſineſs of ſo much conſequence, that I cannot help ſubjoining a few plain conſiderations relating to it. It is true that I can advance nothing <hi>new</hi> upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but I ſhall endeavour to compriſe the merits of the caſe in a very ſmall compaſs, which may give it a chance of being better underſtood; and ſome advantage may ariſe from the ſame things being ſaid in a different manner, and upon a different occaſion.</p>
               <p>THE minds of many, indeed, are ſo obſtinately ſhut againſt conviction, and they are ſo blindly bent on puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vindictive ſchemes of the preſent miniſtry, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regard to reaſon or conſequences, that I deſpair of making any impreſſion upon them. But I wiſh to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs myſelf to thoſe who have not yet taken their part, or who, though they may have been deceived by the falſe lights in which this affair has been repreſented, are cool enough to attend to what may be ſaid on the other ſide. On ſuch I ſhould think that ſome impreſſion might be made by <hi>three conſiderations;</hi> one drawn from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and hiſtory of our conſtitution, another from the nature of things and the principles of liberty in general, and the third from the effects which the oppreſſion of America may have on the liberties of this country.</p>
               <p>IT has ever been a fundamental maxim in our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that the repreſentatives of the people ſhould have a voice in enacting all the laws by which they are governed and that they ſhould have the ſole power of giving their own money. Without theſe privileges there can be no true Britiſh liberty. Theſe maxims were ſo well underſtood, and were held ſo inviolable in all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, that though all the Kings of this country, ſince the conqueſt, have had ſeveral <hi>realms,</hi> or princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:013556_0014_0F90F6A16E498490"/>
ſubject to them, each has always had its ſeparate legiſlative body, its ſeparate laws, and its ſeparate ſyſtem of taxation; and no one of them ever thought of laying a tax upon another.</p>
               <p>WHEN the Kings of England were likewiſe Dukes of <hi>Normandy,</hi> and held other principalities in France, the Engliſh parliament never thought of making laws for the Normans, or the Normans for the Engliſh; and ſtill leſs did either of them preſume to tax the other. <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> though united under one head with England, had its own ſyſtem of laws, and taxation, altogether inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of the Engliſh, till the union of the parliaments of both the nations. <hi>Wales</hi> alſo, and ſeveral <hi>Counties Palatine,</hi> taxed themſelves, without any controul from the parliament of England; and ſo does <hi>Ireland</hi> to this day. So independent were all theſe governments of one another, though the ſame King had a negative upon the reſolutions of them all, that when a man fled from any one of the realms, and took refuge in another, he was as effectually exempted from the juriſdiction of the country he had left as if he had gone into the dominions of another Prince; ſo that no proceſs at law commenced in the former could affect him.</p>
               <p>AGREEABLY to theſe ideas, it could not but have been underſtood, that when many of our anceſtors, the old Puritans, quitted the realm of England, they freed themſelves from the laws of England. Indeed they could have had no other motive for leaving this country; and how could they have expected any relief from tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing refuge in America, if they had found in that country, or carried with them the ſame laws and the ſame admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration by which they were aggrieved in this. But going into a country which was <hi>out of the realm of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and not occupied, they found themſelves at firſt without any laws whatever. But they enacted laws for themſelves, voluntarily chooſing, from their regard to
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:013556_0015_0F90F6A2775FDF70"/>
the country from which they came, to have the ſame common head and center of concord the King of Great Britain, and therefore ſubmitted to his negative upon all their proceedings. They adopted as many of the laws of England as they choſe, but no more; and if they had preferred the laws of Scotland, thoſe of Ireland, or thoſe of any foreign country, they were at liberty to have done it.</p>
               <p>THESE Coloniſts alſo provided for the expences of their own ſeparate governments, granting the King aids for that purpoſe, according to their own judgment and ability, without the interference of the Engliſh parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, till the fatal period of the <hi>ſtamp act,</hi> which was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely an innovation in our conſtitution, confounding the firſt and fundamental ideas belonging to the ſyſtem of <hi>different realms ſubject to the ſame King,</hi> and even in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced <hi>a language quite new to us;</hi> viz. that of <hi>America being ſubject to England.</hi> For America was never thought to be within the realm of England, any more than Scotland or Ireland. If there have been any <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions</hi> to this ſyſtem of legiſlation, or taxation, with reſpect to America, it has been the exerciſe of <hi>tyranny,</hi> and it has not been the leſs ſo for having been <hi>diſguiſed,</hi> or having paſſed <hi>without ſuſpicion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ACCORDING to the language that was univerſally in uſe till of late years, to ſay that <hi>America was ſubject to England,</hi> would have been conſidered as equally abſurd, with ſaying, that it was ſubject to Ireland or to Hanover, that is, the ſubject of ſubjects; all being equally ſubject to one King who is himſelf ſubject to the laws, and who is no longer our <hi>legal and rightful King,</hi> than he is ſo. In this great principle the very eſſence of our liberty, and the independent liberty of each part of the <hi>common empire,</hi> conſiſts.</p>
               <p>SECONDLY, With reſpect to the principles of <hi>liberty in general,</hi> I would obſerve, that if any realm or country
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:013556_0016_0F90F6A67A3DE598"/>
be taxed by another, the people ſo taxed have no proper liberty left, but are in a ſtate of as <hi>abſolute deſpotiſm</hi> as any of which we read in hiſtory, or of which we can form an idea ſince the ſame <hi>foreign power</hi> that can take <hi>one penny</hi> from them without their conſent, may take the <hi>laſt penny that they have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> ſo that, in fact, they have <hi>no property at all of their own</hi> every thing they have being at the mercy of others. This would be the caſe with England, if we were taxed at the pleaſure of the King, or by the parliament of Ireland, or by the houſes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives of America; it would be the caſe of the Iriſh if they were taxed by the Engliſh; and therefore it will be the caſe of the Americans if they be taxed by us.</p>
               <p>IT is ſaid that Leeds, Mancheſter, and other large towns in England, ſend no repreſentatives to parliament, and yet are taxed by it. But there is this very eſſential and obvious difference between their caſe and that of the Americans; viz. That thoſe who tax Leeds. Mancheſter, &amp;c. always tax themſelves at the ſame time, and in the ſame proportion; and while this is the caſe, thoſe towns have no reaſon to be apprehenſive of partiality or oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. To make the caſes parallel, let the parliament lay a ſeparate tax on the towns that ſend no repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and exempt from ſuch tax thoſe, that do ſend mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. In this caſe, I doubt not, but the unrepreſented towns would complain as loudly as the Americans do now, who ſee that we aſſume a power of loading them, and eaſing ourſelves; and that we are endeavouring to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh a <hi>principle,</hi> which will at once give us all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty they have. If there be in nature a juſtifiable caſe of reſiſtance to government, it is this and if the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans have any thing of the ſpirit of Engliſhmen, they will riſk every thing, rather than ſubmit to ſuch a claim. They are willing to be our <hi>fellow-ſubject;</hi> having the ſame common head; but are not willing to be our <hi>ſlaves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT is alledged, that we have <hi>protected</hi> the Americans.
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:013556_0017_0F90F6A7E1A02780"/>
and that they ought to pay for that protection: but have we not alſo protected Ireland and the electorate of Hano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver without pretending either to make laws for them or to tax them? what we may do, or <hi>attempt</hi> to do, when this new doctrine ſhall have been eſtabliſhed in the caſe of the Americans, is as yet unknown. Any favour that we do to the Americans certainly gives us a claim upon their <hi>grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> but it does not make them our ſlaves. Beſides, they have, in many reſpects, made abundant requital, and we were actually reaping a rich harveſt for the little we have ſowed in that fruitful ſoil. But our preſent miniſtry re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the man who would kill the hen that laid the gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en eggs, in order that he might come at all the treaſure at once; and the event will equally diſappoint them both. Or rather, they reſemble the dog, who, by catching at the ſhadow, loſt the ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>MANY perſons of this country are ſo groſsly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, as to imagine, that while we are heavily taxed for the welfare of the common empire, and have even in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred a prodigious debt on that account, the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans pay nothing at all. But have not the Americans their own ſeparate governments to ſupport, as well as we have ours, and do they not tax themſelves for that purpoſe, and do we help them to bear any part of thoſe taxes? If they incur debts, as they ſometimes do, do they not diſcharge them as well as they can? and ſhould we not laugh at them, if they ſhould pretend to have any demand upon us for the payment of them? ſhould we not alſo treat the Iriſh with the ſame contempt in the ſame caſe?</p>
               <p>IN a <hi>common cauſe</hi> the Americans have always been ready to exert themſelves with as much zeal as we have ſhewn; nay, by our own acknowledgement, they have done more. For at the cloſe of the laſt war, we volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily voted them large ſums of money, becauſe we were ſenſible that they had exerted themſelves even beyond
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:013556_0018_0F90F6A951479580"/>
their ability. But their exertions were <hi>voluntary,</hi> as was our acknowledgement.</p>
               <p>AS to the conduct of the preſent miniſtry with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to America, it is no part of my preſent argument; but I cannot help obſerving, that it muſt give pain to every reaſonable man to ſee an Engliſh parliament ſo readily giving their ſanction to meaſures ſo exceedingly abſurd and ruinous. Admitting that the Eaſt-India company has been injured by ſome of the inhabitants of Boſton, reaſonable people would have contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with demanding <hi>ſatisfaction,</hi> and would not have puniſhed the innocent with the guilty, by <hi>blocking up their port.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AN offence of this nature could not in reaſon or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity draw upon them the <hi>abolition of their charter;</hi> which demonſtrates, that none of the colonies have the leaſt ſecurity for ſo much as the <hi>form</hi> of a free conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, all being at the mercy of a foreign power.</p>
               <p>AN offence of this kind did not require that a fleet of eleven ſhips of war, and eight regiments ſhould be ſent thither, with a power to commit all crimes and murders with impunity, and that the wretched inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants ſhould be compelled, upon every accuſation, to leave their friends, and ſubmit to a trial, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently an iniquitous trial, in a foreign country; an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of oppreſſion which, of itſelf, is abſolutely into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, and which it cannot be conceived, that any perſon who has arms in his hands, and the ſpirit of a man within him, can poſſibly ſubmit to.</p>
               <p>WHAT man, finding that the government of his country provided him no ſatisfaction for the murder of a near relation or friend (which will neceſſarily be the caſe, when a trial cannot be had upon the ſpot, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out croſſing the Atlantic ocean, whither he cannot car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:013556_0019_0F90F6A9B612C600"/>
his witneſſes, and ſtill leſs his <hi>feelings</hi>) will not think himſelf not only excuſeable, but even bound in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to take his own ſatisfaction, and engage his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate friends to aſſiſt him in procuring <hi>blood for blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I NEED not aſk any <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> how the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans (whom prelatical tyranny drove from this country, and who are grown numerous, ſtrong, and high ſpirited under a very different treatment) muſt feel in theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances; eſpecially when, at the ſame time, they ſee the boundaries of Canada extended, and made a perfect arbitrary government, as a model no doubt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for their own, in due time, and a check upon them till that time. It is what he himſelf would feel in the ſame circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
               <p>LASTLY, Do you imagine, my fellow-citizens, that we can ſit ſtill, and be the idle ſpectators of the chains which are forging for our brethren in America, <hi>with ſafety to ourſelves?</hi> Let us ſuppoſe America to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly enſlaved, in conſequence of which the Engliſh court can command all the <hi>money,</hi> and all the <hi>force</hi> of that country; will they like to be ſo arbitrary <hi>abroad,</hi> and have their power confined <hi>at home?</hi> eſpecially as troops in abundance can be tranſported in a few weeks from America to England; where, with the preſent ſtanding army, they may inſtantly reduce us to what they pleaſe. And can it be ſuppoſed that the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, being ſlaves themſelves, and having been enſlaved <hi>by us,</hi> will not, in return, willingly contribute their aid to bring us into the ſame condition?</p>
               <p>THESE conſequences appear to me ſo very obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that I think none but the abſolutely <hi>infatuated</hi> can help ſeeing them. Indeed the infatuation is of ſo groſs a nature, and of ſo dangerous a kind, that I cannot help thinking it reſembles that, which uſually preceeds the downfall of ſtates; and it calls to my mind the
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:013556_0020_0F90F6AA759D9DD0"/>
Latin proverb, <hi>Quem Deus vult perdere prius dementat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>PHILIP the II. and the kingdom of Spain, at the height of its power, ſo as to threaten Europe with uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal monarchy, were under a like infatuation. That proud and obſtinate prince imagined that he could eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reduce the Belgic provinces, by writing diſpatches from his cloſet. But the thing that was really effected by all his <hi>orders,</hi> his <hi>generals,</hi> his <hi>fleets,</hi> and his <hi>armies,</hi> after a bloody war of many years, was the independen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of thoſe provinces, and the ruin of Spain.</p>
               <p>WE too affect to ſpeak with the ſame contempt of the people of North America, though the diſparity of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces between Great Britain and them is nothing, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the apparent diſparity between thoſe of Spain and the Belgic provinces.</p>
               <p>ALSO, becauſe the Americans have more of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of religion than ourſelves, we ridicule them as <hi>hypocrites.</hi> But if they be ſuch hypocrites as the purita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical party in England (whom the royaliſts diverted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with ſtigmatizing in the ſame manner) in the time of the civil war, true valour and perſeverance will go hand and hand with their hypocriſy; and the hiſtory of our approaching conteſt will teach mankind the ſame leſſon with our laſt, and ſhow the different effects of <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety</hi> and <hi>profligacy</hi> in ſoldiers. The king began with a manifeſt advantage in point of <hi>diſcipline</hi> and <hi>generals;</hi> and ſo may we in this war. But it ſoon appeared that generals and diſcipline are more eaſily acquired than <hi>principles;</hi> and in the courſe of two or three years, the ſuperiority of the parliamentary forces was as great in one reſpect as in the other.</p>
               <p>TO purſue this ſubject, would carry me far beyond the bounds of my preſent purpoſe. I ſhall therefore return to it, by earneſtly adviſing to oppoſe, at the next

election, every candidate, who, the preſent parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, has concurred in the late attrocious attempts to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh arbitrary power over ſo great a part of the Britiſh empire, to the imminent hazard of our moſt valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able commerce, and of that national ſtrength, ſecurity, and felicity which depend on UNION and on LIBERTY.

               <p>THAT thinking perſons may form ſome idea of what we have to expect from a <hi>war with our colonies,</hi> I ſhall conclude with citing two paragraphs from <hi>Dr. Price's additional Preface to his Appeal to the public, on the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the National Debt.</hi>

Other kingdoms have enacted ſumptuary laws for ſuppreſſing luxury; were we to do this with any conſiderable effect, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence might prove fatal. In ſhort, were our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to avoid deſtroying themſelves by intemperance, or only to leave off the uſe of one or two foreign weeds, the revenue would become deficient, and a public bankruptcy might enſue. On ſuch grounds it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that any kingdom ſhould ſtand long. A dreadful convulſion cannot be very diſtant. The next war will ſcarcely leave a chance for eſcaping it.
