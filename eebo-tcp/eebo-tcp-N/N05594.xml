            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

had deſtroyed them in <hi>Ireland,</hi> they would go over into <hi>England,</hi> and not leave the Memorial of an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Man under Heaven.</p>
            <p>They openly profeſſed, that they held it as lawful to kill a Proteſtant as to kill a Dog. One of their Prieſts ſaid, <hi>That it was no more pity to take their Lives from them, than it is to take a Bone out of a Dogs Mouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Day before this Maſſacre began, the Prieſts gave the People a Diſmiſs at Maſs, with liberty to go out, and to take Poſſeſſion of all their Lands, as alſo to ſtrip, rob and deſpoil them and their Goods and Cattle; the Proteſtants being, as they told them worſe than Dogs, for they were Devils, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Killing of ſuch was a <hi>Meritorious Act,</hi> and <hi>a rare Preſervative againſt the Pains of Purgatory;</hi> and this cauſed ſome of the Murtherers to boaſt, after they had ſlain many of the <hi>Engliſh, that they knew, that if they ſhould die preſently, they ſhould go ſtraight to Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Iriſh,</hi> when the Maſſacre began, perſuaded many of their Proteſtant Neighbours to bring their Goods to them, and they would ſecure them, and hereby they got abundance peaceably into their Hands, whereof they cheated the Proteſtants, refuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to reſtore them again; yet ſo confident were the Proteſtants at firſt of them, that they gave them Inventories of all they had, and digged up their beſt things that were hidden in the Ground, and depoſited them in their Cuſtody. They alſo got much into their Hands by fair Promiſes, deep Oaths and Engagements, that if they would deliver them their Goods, they would ſuffer them, with their Wives and Children, quietly to depart the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:007100_0006_102AF4B58DD35268"/>
and when they had got what they could, they afterwards murthered them.</p>
            <p>Having thus ſeized upon their Goods and Cattle, ranſackt their Houſes, got their Perſons, ſtript Man, Woman and Child naked, and ſo turned then out of doors, ſtrictly prohibiting the <hi>Iriſh</hi> under great penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, not to give them any relief; by means hereof many miſerably periſh'd through cold nakedneſs and hunger.</p>
            <p>In the Town of <hi>Coleraine,</hi> many of theſe poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that fled thither for ſuccour, many thouſands died in two days, ſo that the living could not bury the dead, but laid their Carcaſſes in ranks in waſte and wide holes, ſpeling them up as if they had been Herrings.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Magdalen Redman</hi> depoſeth, that ſhe, and divers other <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> among whom were two and twenty Widows, were firſt robbed, and then ſtript naked, and when they had covered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with ſtraw, the bloody <hi>Papiſts,</hi> threw in burning ſtraw among them, on purpoſe to burn them; then they drove them out into the Woods in Froſt and Snow, where many of them died with extream cold, and thoſe that ſurvived, lived miſerably by reaſon of their many wants.</p>
            <p>Yet though theſe bloody Villains exerciſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human cruelties towards the poor <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> they would commonly boaſt, <hi>That theſe were but the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of their ſorrows,</hi> for indeed they made it good; for having diſarmed the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> robbed them of their goods, ſtript them of their Clothes, and having their Perſons in their power, they furiouſly broke out into all manner of abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Cruelties, horrid Maſſacres, and execrable Murders.</p>

            <p>At <hi>Liſſanſkeach,</hi> they hanged and killed above one hundred of the <hi>Scottiſh Proteſtants,</hi> in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Ardmagh</hi> and <hi>Tyrone,</hi> where the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> were more numerous, their murders were more multiplied, and with greater cruelty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mac-Guire</hi> coming to the Caſtle of <hi>Liſſanſkeach,</hi> deſired to ſpeak with Mr. <hi>Middleton,</hi> who admitted him in, he firſt burnt the Records of the County, then demanded one thouſand pounds which was in the cuſtody of Sir <hi>William Belfores,</hi> which as ſoon as he had, he cauſed Mr. <hi>Middleton</hi> to hear Maſs, and to ſwear that he would never alter from it, and then hanged him up with his Wife and Children; hanging and murdering above one hundred perſons beſides in that place.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Portadown</hi> Bridge, there were one thouſand Men, Women and Children, carried in ſeveral Companies, and all unmercifully drowned in the River. Yea, in that County there were one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand perſons drowned in ſeveral places.</p>

Other companies they carried out to a place fit for execution, and then murdered them. One hundred and fifteen Men, Women and Children, they ſent with Sir <hi>Philemy Oneal</hi>'s paſs, till they came to <hi>Portadown</hi> Bridge, and there drowned them.</p>

            <p>At <hi>Caſel</hi> they put all the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> into a loathſome Dungeon, kept them twelve weeks in great miſery. Some they barbarouſly mangled, and left them languiſhing; ſome they hanged up twice or thrice, others they buried alive.</p>

            <p>In the Town of <hi>Sligo,</hi> all the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> were firſt robbed of their Eſtates, then caſt into Goal, and about Mid-night were all ſtript naked, and there moſt cruelly and barbarouſly murthered with Swords, Axes, Skeins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſome of them being Women great with Child, their Infants thruſt out their Arms and Legs at their Wounds; after which execrable Murthers, theſe Hell-hounds laid the dead naked Bodies of the Men upon the naked Bodies of the Women, in a moſt immodeſt Poſture, where they left them till the next day to be looked upon by the <hi>Iriſh</hi> who beheld it with great delight. Alſo <hi>Iſabel Beard,</hi> great with Child, hearing the lamentable Cries of thoſe that were murthering, ran out into the Streets, where ſhe was murthered, and the next day was found with the Child's Feet coming out of the Wounds in her Sides; many others were murthered in the Houſes and Streets.</p>
            <p>About <hi>Dungannon,</hi> were three hundred and ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in the like barbarous manner mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren; about <hi>Charlemont,</hi> above four hundred; about <hi>Tyrone</hi> two hundred and ſix.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Mac Crew</hi> murthered thirty one in one morning.</p>
            <p>Two young Villains murthered 140 poor Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Children that could make no reſiſtance.
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:007100_0016_102AF4CF5AA9BAB8"/>
An <hi>Iriſh</hi> Woman with her own Hands, murthered forty five.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Portadown</hi> Bridge, were drowned above three hundred, at <hi>Lawgh</hi> were drowned above two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in one day. In the Pariſh of <hi>Killamen,</hi> there were murthered one thouſand and two hundred <hi>Proteſtants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many young Children they cut in Quarters; eighteen <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Infants they hanged upon a Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiers Tenter-hooks; one fat Man they murthered and made Candles of his Greaſe; another <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Man they ript up his Belly, took one end of his ſmall guts, tied it to a Tree, and forced him round about it, till they had drawn them all out of his Body, ſaying, <hi>they would try whether a</hi> Dogs <hi>or a</hi> Scottiſh <hi>Man's Guts were the longeſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the Command of Sir <hi>Philem O Neal,</hi> Mr. <hi>James Maxwell</hi> was drawn out of his Bed, being ſick of a Fever, and murthered, his Wife being in Child-birth, the Child being half born, they ſtript naked, drove her about a flight ſhot, and drowned her in the black-Water; the like, or worſe, they did to another <hi>Engliſh</hi> Woman in the ſame Town. One Mr. <hi>Watſon</hi> they roaſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live. A <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Woman great with Child, they ript up her Belly, cut the Child out of her Womb, and ſo left it crawling on her Body.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Starkey</hi> Schoolmaſter at <hi>Ardmagh,</hi> being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove one hundred years old, they ſtript him naked, then took his daughters, being Virgins, whom they alſo ſtript naked, and then forced them
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:007100_0017_102AF4D221072F58"/>
to lead their aged Father to a Turf-pit, where they drowned them all three.</p>
            <p>To one <hi>Henry Cowel</hi> a gallant Gentleman, they proffered his life, if he would marry one of their Trulls, or go to Maſs; but he choſe death rather than to conſent to either.</p>
            <p>Many of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> they buried alive, ſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing themſelves, whilſt they were digging down old ditches upon them.</p>
            <p>They brake the back bone of a Youth, and left him in the Fields; ſome days after he was found, having eaten the graſs round about him: neither then would they kill him out-right, but removed him to better Paſture, wherein was fulfilled that ſaying, <hi>The tender mercies of the Wicked are cruelty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the County of <hi>Antrim,</hi> they murthered nine hundred and fifty four <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in one Morning; and afterwards about twelve hundred more in that County near <hi>Leſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Sir <hi>Philem O-Neal</hi> boaſted, <hi>that he had ſlain above ſix hundred at</hi> Garvah, <hi>and that he had left neither <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, woman nor child alive in the Barony of</hi> Munter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long. In other places he murthered above two thouſand Perſons in their houſes, ſo that many houſes were filled with dead bodies.</p>
            <p>Above twelve thouſand were ſlain in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, as they fled towards <hi>Downe.</hi> Many died of Famine, many died for want of Cloaths, being ſtript naked in a cold ſeaſon; ſome thouſands were drowned, ſo that in the Province of <hi>Ulſter,</hi> there were about one hundred and fifty thouſand mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by ſundry kinds of torments and deaths.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Popiſh Engliſh</hi> were no whit inferior, yea,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:007100_0018_102AF4D3F6B4BED8"/>
rather exceeded the natural <hi>Iriſh</hi> in their cruelty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> that lived among them, within the <hi>Pale,</hi> being not ſatisfied with their Blood, till they had ſeen the laſt drop thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ann Kinnard</hi> teſtified, <hi>That fifteen</hi> Proteſtants <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impriſoned and their Feet in the Stocks, a</hi> Popiſh <hi>Boy being not above fourteen years old, ſlew them all in one night with his Skein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An <hi>Engliſh</hi> Woman, who was newly delivered of two Children, ſome of theſe Villains violently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled her, in her great pain and ſickneſs, to riſe out of her Bed, and took one of the Infants that was living and daſhed his Brains againſt the Stones, and then threw him into the River of <hi>Barrow;</hi> the like they did to many other Infants. Many others they hanged up without all pity.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Mont Garret,</hi> cauſed divers <hi>Engliſh</hi> Soldiers, that he had taken about <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> to be hanged, hardly ſuffering them to pray before their death.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Fitz Patrick,</hi> an <hi>Iriſh Papiſt,</hi> enticed a rich Merchant that was a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> to bring all his Goods to his Houſe, promiſing ſafely to keep them, and to re-deliver them to him; but when he had gotten them into his poſſeſſion, he took the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant and his Wife, and hanged them both. The like he did by divers others.</p>
            <p>Some <hi>Engliſhmen</hi>'s heads they cut off and carried them to <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> and on the Market-day ſet them on the Croſs; where many, eſpecially the Women ſtab'd, cut and ſlaſhed them.</p>
            <p>A poor <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Woman with her two Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, going to <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> theſe bloody miſcreants baited them with Dogs, ſtabbed them with Skeins,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:007100_0019_102AF4D5A1560EC0"/>
and pulled out the Guts of one of the Children, whereby they died; and not far off they took di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers men, women, and children, and hanged them up; One of the Women being great with Child, they ripped up her Belly as ſhe hanged, ſo that the Child fell out in the Cawl alive. Some after they were hanged, they drew up and down till their Bowels were torn out.</p>
            <p>How many thouſands of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> were thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanly butchered by ſundry kinds of deaths, we cannot aſcertain.</p>
            <p>In the Province of <hi>Ulſter</hi> we find about 150,000 murthered as before; what the number of the ſlain was in the three other Provinces, I find not upon Record, but certainly it was very great, for you have theſe paſſages in a general Remonſtrance of the diſtreſſed <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in the Provinee of <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, We may</hi> (ſay they) <hi>compare our woe to the ſaddeſt Parallel of any Story, Our Churches are profaned by Sacrifices to Idols; Our Habitations are become ruinous heaps; No quality, Age or Sex, priviledged from Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre and lingering deaths, by being robbed, ſtript naked and ſo expoſed to cold and famine. The famiſhed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of murthered Parents ſwarm in our Streets, and for want of food, periſh before our faces,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And all this cruelty that is exerciſed upon us, we know not for what cauſe, offence, or ſeeming provocation it is inflicted on us (ſin excepted) ſaving that we were</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, <hi>&amp;c. We can make it manifeſt that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>populations in this province of</hi> Munſter, <hi>do well near equal thoſe of the whole Kingdom,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And thus in part you have heard of the mercileſs cruelties which the bloody <hi>Papiſts</hi> exerciſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Proteſtants:</hi> Let us now conſider, at leaſt,

ſome of God's Judgments upon the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> whereby he hath not left the innocent Blood of his Servants to be altogether unrevenged.</p>
            <p>Theſe bloody Hell-hounds themſelves confeſſed, <hi>That the Ghoſts of divers of the</hi> Proteſtants <hi>which they had drowned at</hi> Portadown <hi>Bridge, were daily ſeen to walk upon the River, ſometimes ſinging of Pſalms, ſometimes brandiſhing naked Swords, ſometimes ſhreek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a moſt hideous and fearful manner.</hi> So that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the <hi>Popiſh Iriſh</hi> which dwelt near thereabouts, being affrighted therewith, were forced to remove their Habitation further off into the Country.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Divers <hi>Proteſtants</hi> were thrown into the River of <hi>Belterbet,</hi> and when any of them offered to ſwim to the Land, they were knoked on the head with Poles, after which their Bodies were not ſeen for
