            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>GOD out of his Infinite Love, who <hi>delighteth not in the Death of a Sinner, but that all ſhould live and be ſaved, hath given his only Son, to the end that whoſoever believeth on him, ſhou'd not periſh, but have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life: He is the true Light, who enlightneth every Man that cometh into the World.</hi> And this Light would work out the Salvation of All, if not reſiſted. Nor is it leſs <hi>Univerſal</hi> than inbred Sin, being the Purchaſe of his Death who <hi>taſted Death for every Man.</hi> For <hi>as in</hi> Adam <hi>all died, even ſo in</hi> CHRIST <hi>ſhall all be made alive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. But ſome are not afraid to aſſert, That <hi>GOD by an Eternal and unchangable Decree hath predeſtinated to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Damnation the far greater Part of Mankind, and that abſolutely, without any reſpect to their Works, but only for the ſhewing the Glory of his Juſtice: And that for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this about, he hath appointed theſe miſerable Souls neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily to walk in their wicked Ways, that ſo his Juſtice may lay hold on them: And that he juſtly condemns theſe, altho' he hath withheld from them that Grace by which alone they could have laid hold of Salvation, as having decreed, (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reſpect to their Works) That they ſhall not obey, and that the Goſpel which he publickly invites them to accept, ſhall never prove effectual for their Salvation, but only ſerve to aggravate their Guilt, and occaſion their greater Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. We may ſafely call this Doctrine a Novelty, ſeeing in the firſt four hundred Years after Chriſt, there is no
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:005310_0003_1016FB34D0351BE0"/>
Mention made of it, by any Writer, great or ſmall, in any Part of the Chriſtian Church. For, as it is contrary to the Teſtimony of Scripture, and to the Tenor of the Goſpel, ſo all the antient Writers, Teachers and Doctors of the Church, paſs it over with a profound Silence. The firſt Foundations of it were laid, in the latter Writings of <hi>Auguſtine;</hi> who in his Heat againſt <hi>Pelagius,</hi> let fall ſome Expreſſions, which ſome have unhappily glean'd up, for the eſtabliſhing of this Error; thereby contradicting many others and many more, and frequent Expreſſions of the ſame <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> It was afterwards taught by <hi>Dominicus,</hi> a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Frier, and the <hi>Monks</hi> of his Order, and at laſt it was unhappily taken up by <hi>John Calvin,</hi> (otherwiſe a Man in divers reſpects to be commended) to the great ſtaining of his Reputation, and Defamation both of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> and of the Chriſtian Religion. However we ſhould not reject it for the Silence of the Antients, if it had any real Bottom in the Word of GOD; and if it were not <hi>highly injurious to GOD himſelf,</hi> JESUS CHRIST <hi>our Mediator and Redeemer, to the Power, Virtue, Nobility and Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his Bleſſed Goſpel, and laſtly, to All Mankind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Firſt, <hi>It is highly injurious to GOD,</hi> becauſe it makes him the Author of Sin. I confeſs the Aſſertors of this Doctrine deny this Conſequence of it: But that is but a meer Illuſion, and is equally ridiculous, as if a Man ſhould deny, that <hi>two</hi> and <hi>two</hi> makes <hi>four.</hi> For if GOD has decreed, that the Reprobated ſhall Periſh, and if he hath alſo decreed that they ſhou'd walk in thoſe wicked Ways, by which they are led to that End: Who, I pray, is the firſt Author and Cauſe thereof but GOD, who ſo willed and decreed? This is as plain and natural a Conſequence, as any can poſſibly be. And therefore altho' many of the Preachers of this Doctrine have ſought out various ſtrange, ſtrain'd and intricate Diſtinctions to avoid it, yet ſome, and that of the moſt eminent among them, have openly acknowledg'd it. I ſhall inſtance a few among many Paſſages. <note n="(a)" place="bottom">

               <hi>Reprobate Perſons</hi> (ſaith <hi>Piſcator) are abſolutely ordain'd to this twofold End, To undergo ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Puniſhment, and Neceſſarily to Sin: And, therefore to Sin, that they may be juſtly puniſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. If theſe Sayings do not import, That GOD is <hi>the Author of Sin,</hi> we muſt not then ſeek theſe Men's Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions from their Words, but ſome Way elſe. It ſeems as if they had aſſumed to themſelves that monſtrous, two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Will they feign of GOD: One by which they <hi>declare</hi> their Minds openly, and another more <hi>Secret</hi> and <hi>Hidden,</hi> which is quite contrary to the other. Nor doth it at all help them to ſay, That Man ſins <hi>willingly;</hi> ſince that <hi>Willingneſs</hi> to Sin is (according to their Judgment) ſo neceſſarily impoſed upon him, that he cannot but be Willing, becauſe God hath willed and decreed him to be ſo. This Shift is juſt as if I ſhould take a Child unable to reſiſt me, and throw it down from a high Precipice. The Weight of its Body indeed makes it go readily down, and the Violence of the Fall beats out its Brains and kills it. But tho' the Weight of its Body and not any imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:005310_0005_1016FB39245289C8"/>
Stroke of my Hand makes the Child die; whether is the Child or I the proper Cauſe of its Death? Let then any Man judge, whether they who make GOD's Part as great, and more immediate, in the Sins of Men, do not make GOD <hi>the Author of Sin,</hi> and ſo are highly injurious to him?</p>
            <p n="6">6. Secondly, This Doctrine is <hi>injurious to GOD, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it makes him delight in the Death of Sinners,</hi> contrary to the Expreſs Words of GOD himſelf. <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord GOD, I have no Pleaſure in the Death of the Wicked, but that the Wicked turn from his Way and live. Turn ye, turn ye from your evil Ways: For why will ye die, O Houſe of Iſrael?</hi> Ezek. xxxiii. 11. <hi>This is good and acceptable in the Sight of GOD our Saviour: Who willeth all Men to be ſaved, and to come unto the Knowledge of the Truth.</hi> 1. Tim. ii. 4. <hi>The Lord is long-ſuffering, not willing that any ſhou'd Periſh, but that all ſhou'd come unto Repentance.</hi> But if he hath created Men only for this very End, that he might ſhew forth his Vengeance upon them (as theſe Men affirm) and for effecting this End, hath with held from them that Grace, whereby alone they could be ſaved from periſhing, yea and alſo predeſtinated the Evil, that they might fall into it; certainly he muſt <hi>delight in their Death,</hi> contrary to his own expreſs Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Thirdly, <hi>This Doctrine is highly injurious to</hi> CHRIST <hi>our Mediator, and to the Efficacy and Excellency of his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</hi> For it ſuppoſes his Mediation to be neceſſarily of none effect, with regard to the Salvation of the Greater Part of the World: As if he had not by his Sufferings and Death throughly <hi>broken down the middle Wall,</hi> nor yet removed the <hi>Wrath of GOD,</hi> or purchaſed the Love of GOD for all Mankind: As if it was afore decreed, that it ſhould be of no Service, to the far greater Part of Mankind. And it is to no Purpoſe to ſay, That his Death was of Efficacy enough to have ſaved all Mankind; if in effect its Virtue be not ſo far extended, as to put all Mankind into a Capacity of Salvation.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:005310_0006_1016FB3AB6748188"/>8. Fourthly, <hi>It makes the Preaching of the Goſpel a meer Mock and Illuſion,</hi> if many of thoſe to whom it is preached, are by an irrevocable Decree, ſhut out from being beni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited by it. It wholly makes uſeleſs the preaching of Faith and Repentance, and the whole Tenor of the Goſpel Promiſes and Threatings. For if ſuch a Decree be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready paſt, Man needs do nothing but wait for <hi>Irreſiſtable Grace:</hi> Which if he be <hi>Elected,</hi> will come, tho' it be but at his laſt Hour: And if he be <hi>Reprobated,</hi> will never come, be his Diligence and waiting what it can.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Fifthly, <hi>This Doctrine makes the coming of</hi> CHRIST <hi>and his Sacrifice on the Croſs, which the Scripture affirms to have been the Fruit of GOD's Love to the World, to have been rather a Teſtimony of GOD's Wrath to the World, yea one of the greateſt Judgments and Severeſt Acts that can be conceiv'd of GOD's Indignation toward Mankind:</hi> It being only ordain'd (according to this Doctrine) to ſave a very few, and for the hardening and increaſing the Damnation of the far greater Number of Men, namely of all thoſe who do not truly believe: The Cauſe of which Unbelief a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, (as theſe Divines, ſo called, above aſſert) is the hidden Counſel of GOD. Certainly then the coming of CHRIST was never to them a Teſtimony of GOD's Love, but rather of his implacable Wrath: And if the World may be taken for the far greater Number of ſuch as live in it, GOD never loved the World, according to this Doctrine, but rather hated it greatly, in ſending his Son to be crucified in it.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Sixthly, <hi>This Doctrine is highly injurious</hi> to Mankind; for it renders them in a far worſe Condition than the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils in Hell. For theſe were ſome time in a Capacity to have ſtood: They might have kept their happy Eſtate but would not: Whereas many Millions of Men are tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented for ever, according to them, who never were hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, nor ever can be. It renders them in a worſe State than the Beaſts of the Field, of whom the Maſter requires no more than they are able to perform, and if they be killed, Death is to them the End of all Sorrow: Whereas
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005310_0007_1016FB3D90FF2688"/>
Man is in Pain without End, for not doing that which he never was able to do. It puts him into a far worſe Condition than <hi>Pharaoh</hi> put the <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> For tho' he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held Straw from them, yet they could get it by much Labour. But they make GOD to withhold from Men all Means of Salvation, ſo that they cannot attain it by all their Pains. Yea, they place Mankind in that Condition which the Poets feign of <hi>Tantalus:</hi> Who oppreſt with Thirſt, ſtands in Water up to the Chin, yet can by no Means reach it with his Tongue; and being tormented with Hunger, hath Fruits hanging at his very Lips, yet ſo as he can never lay hold of them with his Teeth. And theſe Things are ſo near him, not to nouriſh him, but to torment him. So do theſe Teachers make GOD deal with Mankind. They make the outward Creation, the Works of Providence, the Smitings of Conſcience, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to convince the Reprobates of Sin, but never inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to help them to Salvation. They make the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel, and the offer of Salvation by CHRIST ſufficient to condemn them; ſerving to beget a ſeeming Faith and a vain Hope; yet by Reaſon of GOD's Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible Decree, all theſe (ſay they) are wholly ineffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual to bring them the leaſt Step towards Salvation, and do only contribute to make their Condemnation the greater, and their Torments the more violent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable.</p>
            <p n="11">11. In direct Oppoſition to this we affirm, That <hi>GOD out of his infinite Love, who delighteth not in the Death of a Sinner, but that all ſhould live and be ſaved, hath ſent his only begotten Son into the World, that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever believeth in him might be ſaved.</hi> This Doctrine is ſo evident from the Scripture Teſtimony, that there is ſcarce found any other Article of the Chriſtian Faith, ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, ſo plainly and ſo poſitively aſſerted. It is that which maketh the preaching of CHRIST to be indeed the Goſpel, or <hi>Glad Tidings to All;</hi> as the Angel declared his coming to be, (<hi>Luke,</hi> ii. 10.) <hi>Behold I bring You Good Tidings of Great Joy which ſhall be to all People.</hi> Whereas
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:005310_0008_1016FB430AC17E88"/>
if this Coming of CHRIST had not brought a Poſſibility of Salvation <hi>to all,</hi> it ſhould rather have been accounted <hi>Bad Tidings of great Sorrow to moſt People.</hi> Neither would the Angel have had Reaſon to ſing, <hi>Peace on Earth and Good Will towards Men,</hi> if the Greateſt Part of Mankind had been neceſſarily ſhut out from receiving any Benefit from it. And indeed if ſo, how ſhould CHRIST have ſent out his Servants to <hi>preach the Goſpel to every Creature?</hi> that is, To every Son and Daughter of Mankind; for here is no Exception. He commands them to <hi>preach Salvation to All, Repentance and Remiſſion of Sins to All, warning every one and exhorting every one</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Col.</hi> i. 28. But how cou'd they have preached the Goſpel <hi>to every Man,</hi> as became the Miniſters of CHRIST, <hi>in much Aſſurance,</hi> if Salvation by that Goſpel had not been poſſible to All? What if ſome of thoſe had aſked them, <hi>Hath</hi> CHRIST <hi>died for Me?</hi> Should they have anſwered conditionally, <hi>If thou repent,</hi> CHRIST <hi>died for Thee?</hi> The ſame Queſtion would have recurr'd, <hi>Hath</hi> CHRIST <hi>died for Me that I may repent? Otherwiſe My Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is impoſſible.</hi> To this nothing could be anſwer'd but the ſame thing over again. Whereas thoſe who <hi>bring the Glad Tidings of the Goſpel of Peace,</hi> are to preach the <hi>Common Salvation,</hi> Repentance unto All, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering a Door of Mercy and Hope to All, thro' JESUS CHRIST, <hi>who gave himſelf a Ranſom for All.</hi> The Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel invites All. And certainly CHRIST intended not to deceive and delude the Greater Part of Mankind, when he invites and cries, ſaying, <hi>Come unto me all Ye that are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give You Reſt.</hi> If <hi>All</hi> then ought to ſeek after him, and to look for Salvation by him, he muſt needs have made <hi>Salvation poſſible to All.</hi> For who is bound to ſeek after that which is impoſſible? Certainly it were a Mocking of Men to bid them to do ſo. And ſuch as deny, that by the Death of CHRIST <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is</hi> made poſſible to All Men, do moſt blaſphemouſly make GOD mock the World, in giving his Servants a Commiſſion <hi>to preach the Goſpel of Salvation unto</hi> All,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005310_0009_1016FB45E39081E8"/>
while he hath before decreed, that it ſhall not be poſſible for them to receive it. Do not they make the LORD to ſend forth his Servants <hi>with a Lie in their Mouth,</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, to bid <hi>All</hi> and <hi>every one</hi> believe, that CHRIST died for Them, and had purchas'd Salvation for them: Whereas (according to this Doctrine) he hath done no ſuch thing, or ever intended it? Seeing then CHRIST hath commanded to preach <hi>Repentance and Remiſſion of Sins to All,</hi> it is certain that <hi>he died for All:</hi> And that it is poſſible for all to repent and believe. In as much as he who commiſſion'd his Servants thus to preach, is a GOD of Truth and no Mocker of poor Mankind, neither doth he require of any Man, that which it is ſimply impoſſible for him to do.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Moreover, if we regard the Teſtimony of the Scripture, there is not, that I know of, one Scripture which affirms, CHRIST <hi>did not die for All,</hi> whereas there are divers Scriptures which poſitively and expreſsly affirm, <hi>He did.</hi> As 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 1, 3, 4, 6. <hi>I exhort therefore that firſt of all Supplications, Prayers, Interceſſions and giving of Thanks be made for all Men, &amp;c. For this is good and acceptable in the Sight of GOD our Saviour, who will have all Men to be ſaved and to come to the Knowledge of the Truth—Who gave himſelf a Ranſom for all, to be teſtified in due time.</hi> Except we make the Apoſtle to aſſert quite another thing than he meant there can be noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more plain than this. For firſt he here directs them <hi>To pray for all Men;</hi> and to prevent ſuch an Objection as this, CHRIST <hi>prayed not for the World, neither willeth he us to pray for all: Becauſe he willeth not that all ſhould be ſaved, but hath ordain'd many to be damned,</hi> he adds, <hi>This is good and acceptable with GOD who willeth all Men to be ſaved.</hi> I deſire to know what can be more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly affirmed? Or, can any Two Propoſitions be ſtated in Terms more contradictory, than theſe Two,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>GOD willeth not ſome Men to be ſaved,</hi> and</p>
            <p>
               <hi>GOD willeth all Men to be ſaved?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we believe the laſt, as the Apoſtle hath affirmed, the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005310_0010_1016FB47B95E4F50"/>
firſt cannot be true. Whence (to conclude) he gives us a Reaſon of CHRIST'S Willingneſs that all Men ſhould be ſaved, in theſe Words, <hi>Who gave himſelf a Ranſom for all.</hi> As if he had ſaid, ſince he gave himſelf a Ranſom for All, it is plain he willeth all Men to be ſaved.</p>
            <p n="13">13. The ſame thing is poſitively affirmed, <hi>Heb.</hi> ii. 9. <hi>We ſee</hi> JESUS <hi>who was made a little lower than the Angels, for the ſuffering of Death, crown'd with Glory and Honour, that he by the Grace of GOD might taſte Death for every Man.</hi> He that will but open his Eyes, may ſee this Truth here aſſerted. If <hi>he taſted Death for every Man,</hi> then certainly there is no Man for whom he did not taſte Death; and then there is no Man who may not be made a Sharer of the Benefit of it.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Again, Our LORD himſelf ſays, <hi>He came not to condemn the World, but that the World thro' him might be ſaved. John</hi> iii. 17. And <hi>John</hi> xii. 47. <hi>He came not to judge the World, but to ſave the World:</hi> Whereas, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that Doctrine, he <hi>did</hi> come rather to condemn the World, and not that it might be ſaved by him. For if he did not come to bring Salvation to the greater Part of Mankind, but to increaſe their Condemnation, it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily follows, That he did not come with an Intention to ſave, but to judge and condemn the greater Part of the World, contrary to his expreſs Teſtimony.</p>
            <p n="15">15. Yet again, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> aſſerts, That GOD <hi>willeth the Salvation of all,</hi> ſo doth the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> aſſert, That he <hi>willeth not the periſhing of any,</hi> 2. Pet. iii. 9. <hi>The</hi> LORD <hi>is not ſlack concerning his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, as ſome Men count Slackneſs: But is long ſuffering to us-ward, not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhou'd come to Repentance.</hi> And this is agreeable to that of the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> xxxiii. 11. <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord, I have no Pleaſure in the Death of the Wicked, but that the Wicked turn from his Way and live.</hi> Now if it be ſafe to believe GOD, we muſt not think, that he intends to cheat us by all theſe Expreſſions, but that he is in good Earneſt. And if his Will take not Effect, the blame is
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005310_0011_1016FB4B44296630"/>
on our Parts; which could not be if CHRIST had never died for us but left us under an Impoſſibility of Salvation. What mean all thoſe earneſt Invitations, all thoſe regret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Expoſtulations the Scripture is full of? As <hi>Why will Ye die, O Houſe of Iſrael? They</hi> will <hi>not come unto me that they might have Life. I have waited to be gracious unto You. How often would I have gather'd You, and Ye would not?</hi> Are Men who are ſo invited under no Capacity of being ſaved? Is Salvation impoſſible to them. Will you then ſuppoſe GOD in this to be only like the Author of a <hi>Romance,</hi> or Maſter of a <hi>Comedy,</hi> who amuſes and raiſes the various Affections and Paſſions of the Spectators: Sometimes leading them into Hope, and ſometimes into Deſpair; All this being, in effect, but a meer Illuſion, while he hath appointed what the Concluſion of all ſhall be?</p>
            <p n="16">16. Farther yet; This Doctrine is abundantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by that of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>John</hi> ii. 1, 2. <hi>If any Man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father,</hi> JESUS CHRIST <hi>the Righteous: And he is the Propitiation for our Sins; and not for ours only, but alſo for the Sins of the Whole World.</hi> The Way which our Adverſaries take to evade this Teſtimony, is moſt fooliſh and ridiculous. <hi>The World here,</hi> ſay they, <hi>is the World of Believers:</hi> For which we have nothing but their own Aſſertion. For firſt, let them ſhew me, if they can, in all the Scripture, where <hi>the whole World</hi> is taken for Believers only. I ſhall ſhew them, where it is many times taken for the quite contrary, as, <hi>The World knoweth me not: The World receiveth me not: I am not of this World.</hi> Beſides all theſe Scriptures, <hi>Pſalm</hi> xvii. 14. <hi>Iſai.</hi> xiii. 11. <hi>Matth.</hi> xviii. 7. <hi>John</hi> vii. 7. and viii. 26. and xii. 19. and xiv. 17. and xv. 18, 19. and xvii. 14. and xviii. 20. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> i. 21. and ii. 12. and vi. 2. <hi>Gal.</hi> vi. 14. <hi>James</hi> i. 27. 2 <hi>Peter</hi> ii. 20. 1 <hi>John</hi> ii. 15. and iii. 1. and iv. 4, 5. and many more. Secondly, The Apoſtle in this very Place contradiſtinguiſhes the <hi>World</hi> from the <hi>Saints</hi> thus, <hi>And not for Ours only, but for the Sins of the whole World.</hi> What means the Apoſtle by
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:005310_0012_1016FB4F67464E58"/>
               <hi>Ours</hi> here? Is not that the Sins of Believers? Was not he one of thoſe Believers? And was not this an Univerſal Epiſtle, written to all the Saints that then were? So that according to theſe Men's Comment, there wou'd be a very unneceſſary and fooliſh Redundancy in the Apoſtle's Words, as if he had ſaid, <hi>He is a Propitiation not only for the Sins of all Believers, but alſo for the Sins of all Believers.</hi> Is not this to make the Apoſtle's Words Nonſenſe? Let them ſhew us, where ever there is ſuch a Manner of Speaking in all the Scripture; where any of the Penmen firſt name the <hi>Believers</hi> together with themſelves, and then contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinguiſh them from ſome other <hi>whole VVorld of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="17">17. But we need no better Interpreter for the Apoſtle than himſelf, who uſes the very ſame Expreſſion in the ſame Epiſtle, c. v. 19. Saying, <hi>We know</hi> that we <hi>are of GOD and</hi> the whole World <hi>lieth in VVickedneſs.</hi> There cannot be found in all the Scripture, Two Places which better anſwer one another: Seeing in both the ſame Apoſtle in the ſame Epiſtle, to the ſame Perſons, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiſtinguiſhes <hi>himſelf and the Saints to whom he writes</hi> from <hi>the whole VVorld:</hi> which yet according to theſe Men's Comments ought to be underſtood of <hi>Believers;</hi> as if St. <hi>John</hi> had ſaid, <hi>VVe know Particular Believers are of GOD, but the whole VVorld of Believers lieth in VVicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> What abſurd wreſting of Scripture were this? And yet it may be as well pleaded for as the other. Seeing then the Apoſtle tells us plainly, That CHRIST died not only for the Church of GOD to whom he wrote, but alſo <hi>for the whole VVorld,</hi> let us hold faſt this Truth, which we have received not of Men but of GOD.</p>
            <p n="18">18. But in order to make it yet more plain, we ſhall ſhew theſe two Things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>That GOD hath given to every Man born into the VVorld, a Time or Day of Viſitation, during which they may be ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That for this End, he hath given to every Man, a Meaſure of Light and Grace, which if it is not
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005310_0013_1016FB50ECDD90B0"/>
reſiſted will work the Salvation of All; but if it is, will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their Condemnation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="19">19. Now according to this Doctrine, <hi>the Mercy of GOD is excellently well ſet forth,</hi> in that none are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily ſhut out from Salvation; and his <hi>Juſtice,</hi> in that he condemns none but ſuch as might have been ſaved and wou'd not.</p>
            <p>This Doctrine <hi>agrees with the whole Tenor of the Goſpel,</hi> wherein Repentance and Remiſſion of Sins are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be preach'd to every Creature.</p>
            <p>It <hi>magnifies the Merits and Death of</hi> CHRIST, in that it not only accounts them ſufficient to ſave All, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares them to be brought ſo nigh to All, that they are thereby put into a Capacity of Salvation.</p>
            <p>It <hi>exalts above all the Grace of GOD,</hi> to which it at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes All Good, aſcribing thereto not only the firſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Good, but alſo the whole Converſion and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Soul.</p>
            <p>As <hi>it makes the whole Salvation of Man to depend upon GOD, ſo it makes his Condemnation to be wholly of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> in that he reſiſted the Grace of GOD, and when he might have been ſaved, wou'd not.</p>
            <p>It <hi>takes away all Ground of Deſpair,</hi> in that it gives every Man cauſe to hope for Salvation, <hi>nor yet doth it feed any one in Security,</hi> in that none know how ſoon their Day may expire: And therefore, it is a compleat Incitement and lively Encouragement to every Man, to forſake Evil and cloſe with that which is Good.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>It is really and in effect,</hi> tho' not in ſo many Words, <hi>confirm'd and eſtabliſh'd by all the Preachers of the Chriſtian Religion, that ever were, or now are,</hi> even by thoſe who otherwiſe oppoſe this Doctrine: In that they all, whatſoever Place they come to, do preach to the People and to every Individual among them, that they may be ſaved, intreating them to believe in CHRIST, who hath died for them. So that what they deny in the general, they acknowledge of every Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; there being no Man to whom they do not preach,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005310_0014_1016FB53C31A6B18"/>
in order to Salvation, telling him JESUS CHRIST <hi>calls and wills him to believe and be ſaved:</hi> And that if he refuſe he ſhall therefore be condemn'd, and his Condemnation is of himſelf. Such is the Power of Truth, that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains its Adverſaries, even againſt their Wills to plead for it.</p>
            <p n="20">20. We do not indeed by <hi>this Day of Viſitation,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the whole time of a Man's Life; tho' in ſome it may be extended to the very Hour of Death: But <hi>ſuch a Seaſon,</hi> at leaſt, <hi>as ſufficiently clears GOD of every Man's Condemnation,</hi> which to ſome may be ſooner, and to others later, according as the LORD in his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſees meet. So that many Men may, out-live this Day, after which GOD <hi>ſuffers</hi> them to be <hi>hardned,</hi> as a juſt Puniſhment of their wilful Unbelief, and even <hi>raiſes them up</hi> as Inſtruments of Wrath, and makes them a Scourge one againſt another. To Men in this Condition may be fitly applied thoſe Scriptures, which are abuſed to prove, That GOD conſtrains Men to ſin. This is plainly expreſs'd by the Apoſtle. <hi>Rom.</hi> i. from v. 17. to the end: But eſpecially v. 28. <hi>Even as they did not like to retain GOD in their Knowledge, GOD gave them up to a Reprobate Mind, to do thoſe Things which are not conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</hi> And that many outlive the Day of their Viſitation, appears by CHRIST'S weeping over <hi>Jeruſalem, Luke</hi> xix. 42. ſaying, <hi>If thou hadſt known in this thy Day the Things that belong unto thy Peace! But now they are hid from thy Eyes:</hi> This plainly imports a time when they might have known them, which now was removed from them.</p>
            <p n="21">21. But tho' we affirm there is a time given to all, wherein they <hi>may</hi> be ſaved, yet we deny not ſuch Grace may be given to Some, that they <hi>muſt</hi> be ſaved. There may be ſome in whom the Grace of GOD ſo worketh, that they <hi>cannot reſiſt it.</hi> But there are none in whom it doth not work ſo that they might be ſaved, if they did not wilfully reject Salvation.</p>
            <p n="22">22. By theſe Poſitions, two Great Objections are eaſily ſolved. The firſt is brought from thoſe Places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005310_0015_1016FB55562B4718"/>
wherein GOD ſeems to have predeſtinated ſome to Salvation. We grant he has: So here is no Difficulty at all. The Second is drawn from thoſe Places, wherein GOD ſeems to have predeſtinated ſome to Deſtruction; becauſe he is ſaid, <hi>To harden their Hearts,</hi> and to have <hi>raiſed them up, that they might cauſe his Power to be known.</hi> But if they be number'd among thoſe Men, whoſe Day of Viſitation is over, this Objection alſo is at an end.</p>
            <p n="23">23. We come now more directly to ſhew, <hi>That GOD hath given to every Man a Day or Time of Viſitation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is poſſible for him to be ſaved.</hi> Now if we prove that, there is a Time or Day given, in which thoſe might have been ſaved, who actually periſh, the Matter is done. (For none deny that thoſe who are ſaved have a Day of Viſitation) And this appears by the Complaints the Spirit of GOD, thro'out the whole Scripture, makes, even to thoſe that did Periſh, challenging them for not accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing GOD's Viſitation and offer'd Mercy. Thus the LORD expreſſes himſelf firſt of all to <hi>Cain,</hi> Gen. iv. 6, 7. <hi>And the</hi> LORD <hi>ſaid unto Cain, why art thou wroth, and why is thy Countenance fallen? If thou doſt well, ſhalt Thou not be accepted? If thou doſt not well, Sin lieth at the Door.</hi> This was ſaid to <hi>Cain,</hi> before he ſlew his Brother. We ſee how GOD gave him Warning; and offer'd, in the Day of his Viſitation, Acceptance if he did well. For thoſe Words, <hi>Shalt thou not be accepted?</hi> muſt import, <hi>Thou ſhalt be accepted, if thou doeſt well.</hi> So that if we may truſt GOD, the Fountain of all Truth, there was a Day in which it was poſſible, even for <hi>Cain</hi> to be accepted. The LORD himſelf alſo ſhews, That he gave a Day of Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to <hi>the old World, Gen.</hi> vi. 3. <hi>And the</hi> LORD <hi>ſaid, my Spirit ſhall not always ſtrive with Man:</hi> Manifeſtly implying, That his Spirit did ſtrive with him for a Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which Seaſon expiring, GOD ceas'd to ſtrive with him in order to his Salvation. From this Day of Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which GOD hath given to many, it is, that he is ſaid to <hi>wait to be gracious, Iſai.</hi> xxx. 18 And to be <hi>long-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, Exod.</hi> xxxiv. 6. <hi>Numb.</hi> xiv. 18. <hi>Pſal.</hi> lxxxvi. 15.
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005310_0016_1016BA5B366A2148"/>
and <hi>Jer.</hi> xv. 15. where the Prophet in his Prayer lays hold on the <hi>Long-ſuffering of GOD;</hi> and in his Expoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulating with GOD, he ſhuts out the Objection of our Adverſaries in the 18th Verſe, <hi>Why is my Pain perpetual and my Wound incurable, which refuſeth to be healed? Wilt Thou altogether be unto me as a Liar and as Waters that fail?</hi> Whereas, according to our Adverſaries Opinion, <hi>the Pain</hi> of the moſt Part of Men is <hi>perpetual,</hi> and <hi>their Wound altogether incurable.</hi> Yea the Offer of Salvation unto them is <hi>as a Lie and as Waters that fail,</hi> being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver intended to be of any Effect unto them. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſays expreſsly, That this <hi>Long ſuffering of GOD waited in the Days of</hi> Noah, <hi>for thoſe of the Old World;</hi> anſwerably to <hi>Gen.</hi> vi. 3. And that none may object that this <hi>Long-ſuffering</hi> or <hi>ſtriving of the</hi> LORD was not in order to their Salvation, the ſame Apoſtle faith as expreſsly (2. <hi>Pet.</hi> iii, 15.) That <hi>the Long-ſuffering of GOD is to be accounted Salvation:</hi> And with this <hi>Long-ſuffering,</hi> a little before he couples, That <hi>he is not willing that any ſhould periſh.</hi> Where, taking him for his own Interpreter, as is moſt fit, he teaches, that thoſe to whom the LORD is <hi>long-ſuffering</hi> (which he declareth he was to the Old World, and is now to All, <hi>not willing that any ſhould periſh</hi>) they are to <hi>account this Long-ſuffering of GOD to them Salvation.</hi> But how can they account it Salvation, if there be not ſo much as a Poſſibility of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation conveyed to them therein?</p>
            <p n="24">24. St. <hi>Peter,</hi> further refers to the Writings of <hi>Paul,</hi> ſhewing this to have been the Univerſal Doctrine. Where it is obſervable he adds, <hi>In which are ſome Things hard to be underſtood, which they that are unlearned and unſtable wreſt to their own Deſtruction:</hi> Intimating plainly thoſe Expreſſions in <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles, as <hi>Rom.</hi> ix. &amp;c. which ſome <hi>unlearned</hi> in Spiritual Things, <hi>wreſted</hi> ſo as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict <hi>GOD's Long ſuffering towards All, not willing that any</hi> of them <hi>ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to the</hi> ſaving <hi>Knowledge of his Truth.</hi> Wou'd to GOD many had taken more Heed than they have to this Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement.</p>
            <p n="25">
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:005310_0017_1016FB5F01102BC8"/>25. That Place of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> which <hi>Peter</hi> ſeems here more particularly to hint at, doth much contribute alſo to clear the Matter, <hi>Rom.</hi> ii. 4. <hi>Deſpiſeſt thou the Riches of his Goodneſs and Forbearance and Long ſuffering, not knowing that the Goodneſs of GOD leadeth thee to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance?</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks here to the unregenerate and wicked, who (in the folowing Verſe he ſaith) <hi>treaſure up Wrath unto the Day of Wrath.</hi> And to ſuch he commends <hi>the Riches of the Forbearance and Long ſuffering of GOD,</hi> ſhewing that its tending is, To lead them to Repentance. But how cou'd it have this Tendency, To lead them to Repentance? Or how cou'd it be called <hi>Riches of Goodneſs</hi> to them, if there was not a Time wherein they might repent by it, and come to be Sharers of the <hi>Riches</hi> thereof?</p>
            <p n="26">26. The Sum is this: If GOD plead with the Wicked, from the Poſſibility of their being accepted; if GOD'S Spirit ſtrive with them for a Seaſon, in order to ſave them who afterwards periſh; if he wait to be gracious unto them; if he be Long-ſuffering towards them; if during the Time of this Long-ſuffering GOD willeth them not to periſh, but by the Riches of his Goodneſs and Forbearance leadeth them to Repentance; Then there was a Day of Viſitation, even to thoſe who have periſh'd, wherein they might have been ſaved.</p>
            <p n="27">27. Secondly, This appears from <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> v. 4. <hi>What could I have done more to my Vineyard?</hi> For in Verſe 2, he ſaith, <hi>He had ſenced it and gather'd out the Stones thereof and planted with the choiceſt Vine. And yet</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>when I looked it ſhould have brought forth Grapes, it brought forth Wild Grapes.</hi> Wherefore he calleth the Men of <hi>Judah</hi> to judge between him and his Vineyard, ſaying, <hi>What cou'd I have done more to my Vineyard than I have done in it? And yet</hi> (as is ſaid) <hi>it brought forth Wild Grapes:</hi> Which was applied to thoſe in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who refuſed GOD's Mercy. The ſame Similitude is uſed by CHRIST, <hi>Matt.</hi> xxi. 33. <hi>Mark</hi> xii. 1. and <hi>Luke</hi> xx. 9. where JESUS ſhews, how to ſome <hi>a Vineyard was planted,</hi> and all Things given neceſſary for them, to get them Fruit
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:005310_0018_1016FB60D95630D8"/>
to render their Maſter, and how the Maſter many Times waited to be merciful to them, in ſending Servants after Servants, and paſſing by many Offences, before he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to deſtroy and caſt them out. Now this cannot be underſtood of the Saints, or of ſuch as repent and are ſaved: For its ſaid expreſsly, <hi>He will deſtroy them.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would the Parable any way anſwer the End for which it is brought, if theſe Men had not been in a Capacity to have done good. Yea ſuch was their Capacity that CHRIST ſaith in the Prophet, what cou'd I have done more? So that it is manifeſt, by this Parable, repeated by Three Evangeliſts, CHRIST declares his Long-ſuffering towards thoſe Men, who, when Means of Salvation were afforded to them, did nevertheleſs reſiſt and wou'd not be ſaved.</p>
            <p n="28">28. Laſtly, That there is a Day of Viſitation given even to the Wicked, wherein they may be ſaved, and which being expired they are then ſhut out from Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, appears evidently by CHRIST'S Lamentation over <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> expreſt in three ſundry Places, <hi>Matt.</hi> xxiii. 37, <hi>Luke</hi> xiii. 34, and 19, 41, 42. <hi>And when he was come near, he beheld the City and wept over it, ſaying, If thou hadſt known, even thou, at leaſt in this thy Day the Things that belong to thy Peace! But now they are hid from thine Eyes:</hi> Than which nothing can be more plain. For firſt, he here ſhews, That there was a Day, wherein the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> might <hi>have known thoſe Things that belonged to their Peace:</hi> Secondly, That during that Day, he was willing to have <hi>gather'd them, even as a Hen gathereth her Young:</hi> Thirdly, That becauſe they refuſed <hi>the Things belonging to their Peace,</hi> they were at length <hi>hid from their Eyes.</hi> Why were they hid? Becauſe ye wou'd not ſuffer me to <hi>gather You;</hi> ye wou'd not ſee thoſe Things that were <hi>good for you,</hi> in the Seaſon of GOD's Love towards you: And therefore <hi>now,</hi> that Day being expired, <hi>ye cannot ſee them.</hi> And for a farther Judgment, GOD ſuffers you to be harden'd in Unbelief.</p>
            <p n="29">29. So it is after they have rejected the Offer of
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:005310_0019_1016FB62644A0618"/>
Mercy, and Salvation, and not before, that GOD harden, Mens Hearts. And thus <hi>To him that hath ſhall be given; and from him that hath not, ſhall be taken away, even that which he hath: He hath not;</hi> becauſe he hath loſt the Seaſon of uſing it, and ſo to him it is now as nothing. For CHRIST uſes this Expreſſion, <hi>Matt.</hi> xxv. 26. on occaſion of the taking <hi>the one Talent</hi> from the ſlothful Servant: Which Talent was no way inſufficient of itſelf, but of the ſame Nature with thoſe given to the others. And therefore the LORD had Reaſon to exact the Profit of it proportionably, as of the reſt. So (I ſay) it is after rejecting the Day of Viſitation, that the Judgment of Obduration is inflicted on Men: As CHRIST pronounces it on the <hi>Jews,</hi> out of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> vi. 9. which all the Four Evangeliſts mention. <hi>Matt.</hi> xiii. 14. <hi>Mark</hi> iv. 12. <hi>Luke</hi> viii. 10. <hi>John</hi> xii. 40. And laſt of all, St. <hi>Paul,</hi> after he had offered Salvation to the <hi>Jews</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces the ſame, <hi>Acts</hi> xxviii. 26. <hi>Well ſpake the Holy Ghoſt by Iſaiah the Prophet unto our Fathers, ſaying, Go unto this People and ſay, Hearing ye ſhall hear, and ſhall not underſtand, and ſeeing ye ſhall ſee, and ſhall not perceive. For the Heart of this People is waxed groſs and their Ears are dull of hearing, and their Eyes have they cloſed; leaſt they ſhould ſee with their Eyes, and hear with their Ears, and underſtand with their Hearts, and ſhould be converted and I ſhould heal them.</hi> So it appears, that GOD wou'd have had them to ſee, but <hi>they cloſed their Eyes;</hi> and therefore they were juſtly harden'd.</p>
            <p n="30">30. What now remains to be proved is, <hi>That GOD hath given to every Man during the Day of his Viſitation, a Meaſure of ſaving ſufficient Light and Grace.</hi> And this I ſhall prove, thro' GOD's Aſſiſtance, by plain and clear Teſtimonies of Scripture.</p>
            <p n="31">31. Firſt, from that of St. <hi>John</hi> i. 9. <hi>That was the True Light which lighteth every Man that cometh into the World.</hi> He had ſaid before, <hi>The Life that is in him is the Light of Men,</hi> and, <hi>the Light ſhineth in the Darkneſs:</hi> And to this he adds, <hi>He is the true Light that lighteth every Man that cometh into the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="32">
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:005310_0020_1016FB668EC858F8"/>32. From whence we may in ſhort obſerve, That the Apoſtle calls CHRIST <hi>the Light of Men.</hi> And as he is the Light, <hi>if we walk with him in that Light</hi> which he communicates to us, we come to <hi>have Fellowſhip</hi> and Communion <hi>with him,</hi> as the ſame Apoſtle ſaith elſewhere, 1 <hi>John</hi> i. 7 Secondly, That <hi>this Light ſhineth in the Darkneſs, tho' the Darkneſs comprehend it not.</hi> Thirdly, That <hi>this true Light lighteth every Man who cometh into the World.</hi> Here the Apoſtle carefully avoids their Captiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who wou'd reſtrain this to a certain Number; for, where every one is, there is none excluded. And ſhou'd they ſay, that this <hi>every Man</hi> is only <hi>every one of the Elect,</hi> the following Words <hi>every Man that cometh into the World</hi> wou'd plainly refute them. So that it is clear, there comes no Man into the World, whom CHRIST hath not <hi>enlightened</hi> in ſome Meaſure, and in whoſe dark Heart the Light hath not ſhined. <hi>Tho' the Darkneſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it not,</hi> yet it <hi>ſhineth</hi> there, and the Nature thereof, is to diſpel the Darkneſs, where Men ſhut not their Eyes upon it.</p>
            <p n="33">33. And for what End this Light is given, is expreſt in Verſe 7. where <hi>John</hi> is ſaid to come for <hi>a Witneſs to bear Witneſs to the Light, that all Men thro' it might believe.</hi> Our Tranſlators indeed (to make it ſuit their own Doctrine) have turned the Words <hi>thro' Him,</hi> as if all Men were to believe thro' <hi>John.</hi> For which as there is nothing in the Text, ſo it is contrary to the whole Strain of the Context. For ſeeing CHRIST hath lighted every Man with this Light, is it not, that they may come to believe <hi>thro' it? John</hi> ſhined not in Darkneſs, but this Light <hi>ſhineth in the Darkneſs,</hi> that having diſpell'd the Darkneſs, it may beget Faith.</p>
            <p n="34">34. Seeing then this Light is the Light of JESUS CHRIST, and the Light thro' which Men come to believe it needs not to be doubted, but that it is a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, ſaving and ſufficient Light. It cannot be any of the natural Faculties of our Soul, becauſe it is ſaid to ſhine in the Darkneſs, which Darkneſs is no other than
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:005310_0021_1016FB68138F33C0"/>
the natural State of Man. And that it is ſufficient and ſaving, I prove thus:</p>
            <p>That which is given that all Men thro' it may believe; that by walking in which we have Fellowſhip with GOD, muſt be ſufficient to Salvation; but ſuch is <hi>this Light.</hi> Therefore, it is ſufficient for Salvation.</p>
            <p>Again, That which we are commanded to <hi>believe in, that we may become the Children of the Light,</hi> muſt be a ſupernatural, ſufficient and ſaving Principle: But we are commanded ſo to <hi>believe in this Light.</hi> Therefore, It is a ſupernatural, ſufficient, and ſaving Principle.</p>
            <p>The firſt Propoſition cannot be denied; the ſecond is CHRIST'S own Words, <hi>John</hi> xii. 36. <hi>While ye have the Light, believe in the Light, that ye may be the Children of the Light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="35">35. If it be ſaid, That by <hi>Light</hi> here is meant CHRIT'S outward Perſon, this is ſufficiently anſwered by the Words themſelves, and by the Verſe going before, <hi>Walk, while ye have the Light, leaſt Darkneſs come upon you;</hi> plainly importing, That when that Light in which they were to believe was removed, they ſhou'd loſe the Capacity or Seaſon of believing. Now this cou'd not be underſtood of CHRIST'S Perſon; for many did ſavingly believe in Him (as we do at this Day) when His outward Perſon was far removed from them. So that this Light in which they were commanded to believe muſt be that inward Light from CHRIST, which ſhines in every Man's Heart for a Seaſon, even during the Day of his Viſitation: While this continueth to call, invite and exhort, Men are ſaid to have it, and may believe in it. But when they have rejected it, it is at length withdrawn, and then they know not where to go. And therefore to ſuch rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious ones, the Day of the Lord is ſaid to be <hi>Darkneſs</hi> and not <hi>Light, Amos</hi> v. 18.</p>
            <p n="36">36. That <hi>a Meaſure of this ſaving Light or Grace is given to All,</hi> CHRIST telleth us expreſsly in the Parable of the Sower, <hi>Matt.</hi> xiii. <hi>Mark</hi> iv. and <hi>Luke</hi> viii. where He ſaith, That this Seed ſown in thoſe ſeveral Sorts of
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:005310_0022_1016FB6AE4A91220"/>
Ground, is <hi>The Word of the Kingdom,</hi> even <hi>that Word which,</hi> as St. <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>is able to ſave the Soul.</hi> Now we may obſerve, That the Seed which was ſown by the <hi>Way-ſide,</hi> and in the <hi>Stony</hi> and <hi>Thorny-Ground,</hi> altho' it did not profit there, was the ſame Seed which was ſown in the <hi>good Ground.</hi> But the Cares of the World, or the Deceitfulneſs of Riches, or the Deſire of other Things, or the Fear of Perſecution, hinders this Seed from growing in the Hearts of many. Not but that, in its own Nature, it is ſufficient to Salvation; being the very ſame with that, which groweth up and proſpereth in the Hearts of thoſe who receive it. So that, tho' all are not ſaved by it, yet there is a Seed of Salvation ſown in the Hearts of All, which wou'd grow up and ſave the Soul, if it were not choaked and hindred.</p>
            <p n="37">37. To this anſwers the Parable of the <hi>Talents, Matt.</hi> xxv. He that had two <hi>Talents</hi> was accepted as well as he that had <hi>five,</hi> becauſe he uſed them to his Maſter's Profit. And he that had <hi>one</hi> might have done the ſame. His <hi>Talent</hi> was of the ſame Nature with the Reſt. It was as capable to have brought forth an Increaſe in Proportion as any of theirs. And ſo, tho' there be not a like Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Grace given to all, but to ſome <hi>five Talents,</hi> to ſome <hi>two,</hi> and to ſome <hi>one Talent</hi> only, yet there is given to All that which is ſufficient, and no more is required than according to that which is given: For <hi>unto whomſoever much is given, of him alſo much ſhall be requir'd. Luke</hi> xii. 48. <hi>He that had the two Talents was accepted</hi> in giving <hi>four,</hi> nothing leſs than he that gave the <hi>ten.</hi> So ſhou'd he alſo that gave the <hi>one,</hi> if he had given <hi>two.</hi> And no doubt <hi>one</hi> was as capable of producing <hi>two,</hi> as <hi>five</hi> of producing <hi>ten,</hi> or <hi>two four.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="38">38. I ſhall add but one Proof more, <hi>That all Men have a Meaſure of ſaving Grace,</hi> which is that of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Titus</hi> c. ii. 11. <hi>The Grace of GOD that bringeth Salvation hath appeared unto all Men:</hi> Than which there can be nothing more clear, it comprehending both Parts of the Controverſy. Firſt, it teſtifies, that it is no natural
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:005310_0023_1016FB6CF73502C8"/>
Principle, but the <hi>Grace</hi> of GOD <hi>bringing Salvation.</hi> Secondly, It ſays, that this hath appeared, not to <hi>a Few,</hi> but <hi>to all Men.</hi> And there is nothing (as the following Words declare) required of Man, which this Grace teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not. Yet I have heard a Publick Preacher, to evade the Strength of this Text, deny this Grace to be ſaving and ſay, <hi>It meant only common Graces, ſuch as is the Heat of the Fire and the Light of the Sun.</hi> Such is the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thoſe that oppoſe the Truth! Whereas the Text ſaith expreſsly, it is ſaving <hi>(Soterios.)</hi> Others that cannot deny but it is ſaving, ſay, This <hi>all</hi> Means not every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual, but only ſome of all Kinds. But is a bare Denial ſufficient to overturn a poſitive Aſſertion? If the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures may be ſo abuſed, what ſo abſurd as may not be pleaded for from them? Or what ſo manifeſt as may not be denied? We have then no Reaſon to be ſtagger'd at their denying what the Scripture expreſsly affirms. They may as well perſuade us, that we do not intend that which we affirm, as make us believe the Apoſtle ſpeaks a Thing in plain Words, and yet intends quite the Contrary.</p>
            <p n="39">39. And indeed can there be any Thing more abſurd, than to ſay, where the Word is plainly ALL it does not mean ALL, but only FEW? It is true that ALL is ſometimes taken for the <hi>greater Number,</hi> of two Numbers mention'd; but let them ſhew us if they can, either in Scripture, or Profane or Eccleſiaſtical Writings, that any Man who wrote Senſe, did ever uſe the Word ALL, to expreſs of two Members, the Leſſer. Whereas they affirm, that the far Leſſer Number have receiv'd ſaving Grace, and yet will have the Apoſtle to ſignify them only by the Word ALL: Contrary to all the Rules of ſpeaking, as well as to the whole Tenor of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="40">40. We conclude then, That <hi>the Goſpel is</hi> indeed <hi>Good Tidings of Great Joy which may be unto all People:</hi> That the Miniſters thereof, <hi>are to preach to every Creature, to declare to all the common Salvation,</hi> and to offer <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Remiſſion of Sins, to all, warning every one
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:005310_0024_1016FB71378929C0"/>
and exhorting every one:</hi> That CHRIST <hi>died for All</hi> who died in <hi>Adam,</hi> that <hi>he gave himſelf a Ranſom for All; taſting Death for every Man:</hi> That <hi>he came not to condemn the World, but that the World thro' him might be ſaved: That he willeth that all Men ſhould be ſaved, and willeth not that any ſhou'd periſh:</hi> That <hi>he is the Propitiation not for our Sins only, who believe, but alſo for the Sins of the whole World.</hi> That accordingly he giveth to all a Day or Time of Viſitation, wherein it is poſſible for them to be ſaved; and therein a Meaſure of ſaving Grace, ſo that if they die, their Blood is on their own Heads: Seeing, when they <hi>might</hi> they <hi>wou'd</hi> not come unto Him, that they might have Life.</p>
