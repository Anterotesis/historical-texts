            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap> ſpurious Infant, which ſhe was deliver'd of when alone, and was afterwards found dead; which Fact is a plain violation of a good and wholſome Law of this Province: Which Law is here inſerted, for further ſpreading the Knowledge of it, and to prevent Lives being loſt thro' Ignorance thereof.</p>
            <div type="act">
               <head>An Act to prevent the Deſtroying and Murdering of Baſtard Children.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>WHEREAS many Lewd Women, that have been Delivereed of Baſtard Children, to avoid their Shame, and to eſcape Puniſhment do ſecretly Bury or Conceal the Death of their Children; and after, if the Child be found Dead, the ſaid Women do allege that the ſaid Child was born dead; whereas it falleth out ſometimes (although hardly it is to be proved) that the ſaid Child or Children were Murdered by the ſaid Women their Lewd Mothers, or by their Aſſent or Procurement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Be it therefore Enacted by the Lieutenant Governour, Council and Repreſentatives, Convened in General aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and by the authority of the ſame, That if any Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man be Delivered of any Iſſue of her Body, Male or Female, which if it were born Alive, ſhould by Law be a Baſtard; and that ſhe endeavour privately, either by Drowning or ſecret Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying thereof, or any other way; either by her ſelf, or the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of others ſo to conceal the Death thereof, that it may not come to light, whether it were Born Alive or not, but be conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: In every ſuch caſe the Mother ſo Offending, ſhall ſuffer Death, as in caſe of Murder. Except ſuch Mother can make proof by One Witneſs at the leaſt, that the Child whoſe Death was by her ſo intended to be concealed, was born Dead.</p>

            <head>TO THE YOUNG READERS.</head>
            <p>YOU have now in your Hands a very ſerious and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetical SERMON, preach'd on a ſolemn &amp; awful Occaſion, which it is wiſh'd and hop'd may, by the Efficacy of the Spirit of Grace, prove a means of Awakening, of Reſtraint, and of Converſion to many of you.</p>
            <p>It is to be taken Notice of, That of the many Malefactors which have ſuffer'd Death among us within the Space of <hi>Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Years</hi> paſt, not above one of them was born in this Country. But now our GOD has humbled us by leaving a Child of the <hi>Town,</hi> one under the ſacred <hi>Bonds of the Covenant,</hi> to thoſe Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, more eſpecially the repeated Crimes of <hi>Unchaſtity,</hi> which have ripen'd her for the Vengeance of a Capital Execution; in which God has <hi>ſet</hi> her <hi>forth for an Example</hi> to the Children of <hi>New-England,</hi> to warn them not to Sin away their Convictions and Awakenings, and by rebelling againſt His Holy Spirit, provoke Him to take off His Reſtraints, and ſo leave them to thoſe Courſes that ſhall undo and deſtroy them.</p>
            <p>It may be there is no Place in the World, where ſuch Pains are taken with condemn'd Criminals to prepare them for their Death; that <hi>in the Deſtruction of the Fleſh, the Spirit may be ſaved in the Day of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> The compaſſionate <hi>Judges</hi> always allow a conſiderable Time (commonly a <hi>Month</hi> at leaſt) after the Sentence is pronounc'd, before the Execution is proceeded in. All this while they are viſited, it may be every Day, by ſome or other of the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the Town, to inſtruct them, direct them, and pray with them. They have alſo the Liberty to attend in our publick Aſſemblies, on <hi>Lecture-Days</hi> and on <hi>Lord's Days,</hi> that they may have the Benefit of thoſe Ordinances which CHRIST has appointed, and by the Working of His Spirit makes to be the effectual Means of the Converſion and Salvation of Sinners; when both the <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Sermons</hi> are adapted to their particular Caſe &amp; Circumſtances, while it is at the ſame time endeavour'd to improve the Providence for the Benefit of the numerous Concourſe of People, eſpecially of the <hi>Younger Sort,</hi> which uſually appear on ſuch an Occaſion</p>
            <p>It was on the <hi>laſt Sabbath</hi> of her Life, that this poor <hi>Dau'ter of Death,</hi> and the great Aſſembly preſent, were entertain'd with
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:003655_0004_10023E3AA1638410"/>
the following Diſcourſe, on a Subject very ſutably choſen, ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly calculated, not to gratify an itching Ear, but to reach the Heart and awaken the Conſcience; and therefore drawn up very much in Scripture Language, which carries a peculiar Force and Pungency with it; and is now publiſh'd with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious Enlargements in ſome Parts of the Application. The poor Creature her ſelf afterwards ſpake of it, and of the publiſhing it, in ſuch a Manner as gives ſome Reaſon to hope, it came <hi>with Power</hi> upon her Soul.</p>
            <p>To this is added the Conference had with her in the Way to her Execution, by our <hi>worthy Brother</hi> who to gratify her own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire attended her thither; and has now recollected the Subſtance of what occur'd in that Converſation, to gratify ſome of his Friends who requeſted it of him; by which it appears the laſt, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſt precious Minutes of her Life, were improv'd to the beſt Advantage. Her Anſwers indeed were but ſhort; as ſhe never us'd to ſay much when we diſcourſed with her. But the Queſtions were the moſt proper &amp; ſutable that could be, leading her, by a ſtudy'd &amp; regular, yet eaſy &amp; familiar Train of Tho't, into thoſe grand Points, in which <hi>is the Life of our Spirit.</hi> Many will be pleas'd, and I hope profited, to ſee them. The Reader may place himſelf in the View of Death, and then put them to his own Soul, till he feels the Impreſſion of them.</p>
            <p>It appear'd to me one of the beſt Symptoms upon this poor Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, that ſhe ſeem'd deſirous her Example might be a Warning to others. She did therefore, of her own Accord, deſire ſome of the Miniſters, ſolemnly to caution Young People, not to have <hi>their Life,</hi> as hers had been, <hi>among the Unclean.</hi> So that in this Publication we do but come to you with a Meſſage from the dead; Or, She her ſelf does, as it were, come from the dead to warn you: tho', if you <hi>hear not Moſes and the Prophets,</hi> Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and his ordinary Miniſters, <hi>neither would you be perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed tho' one ſhould</hi> indeed <hi>come from the dead</hi> and ſpeak unto you. However <hi>that</hi> might terrifie you, it of it ſelf would not, could no convert you, unleſs the Holy Spirit ſet in with His Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Influences, which are moſt likely to be afforded in the Uſe of thoſe Means which are of his own Appointment.</p>
            <p>How fit a Word is this, which GOD has directed his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to, wherewith to addreſs the Young Sinner, the vain and lewd Youth? If this will not awaken your Fears, to hear of the <hi>Wrath of Almighty GOD</hi> which is incens'd againſt you, and of that <hi>Stroke</hi> of his powerful Vengeance to which you are every Moment expos'd, and which, when it is once given, will ſend you into that <hi>Place of Miſery,</hi> from which there is <hi>no Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
               <pb n="iii" facs="unknown:003655_0005_10023E6574838310"/>
no, not thro'out the endleſs Ages of Eternity; if this, I ſay, will not alarm your Fears, and awaken in you a moſt ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous Concern how to eſcape the dreadful Danger you are in, and provide for the ſafety of your never-dying Soul, what will? If you can read ſuch a Sermon as <hi>this,</hi> and ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue fearleſs and careleſs, and indulge your ſelf in criminal Courſes, in thoſe Impurities which <hi>the Holy One of Iſrael</hi> cannot look upon without the utmoſt Abhorrence; may it not juſtly be fear'd, that God has in a judicial way, <hi>pour'd out upon you the Spirit of deep Sleep,</hi> and given you up to your own Hearts Luſts till by filling up the meaſure of your Sin, you become prepared for that amazing Stroke, in which theſe awful Words will be again fulfill'd, and which will make you a Warning to others, as others have been to you?</p>
            <p>I know there is in your Hearts a curſed Principle of Infidelity, that will ſuggeſt to you, <hi>"I ſhall have Peace, tho' I walk in the Imagination of my Heart, and add Iniquity to Iniquity."</hi> You may be ready to think your ſelves as ſecure of your Lives, as if you had made a Bargain with Death, not to come till you ſend for him; not to <hi>take you away with a Stroke,</hi> but to let you ſtand till old Age gradually conſumes you. So there were ſome of old who lull'd themſelves aſleep in carnal Security, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>"We have made a Covenant with Death, and with Hell we are at Agreement; when the overflowing Scourge ſhall paſs through, it ſhall not come unto us."</hi> But they had this Anſwer from the Lord God, <hi>"Your Covenant with Death ſhall be diſannulled, and your Agreement with Hell ſhalt not ſtand; when the overflowing Scourge ſhall paſs through, then ye ſhall be troden down by it."</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Iſai. 28. 15, 18.</note> Don't then <hi>make Lies your Refuge,</hi> or ſeek to <hi>cover your ſelves in hiding Places of Deceit.</hi> Has not the Juſtice of God, made quick Work with other Sinners? When they have cried, <hi>Peace, Peace; ſudden Deſtruction has overtaken them.</hi> You ſee here, It was an Obſervation in the Days of <hi>Elihu, "They die in Youth,</hi> whoſe <hi>Lives are among the Unclean".</hi> And has not the Obſervation been verified all along, from that Day to this? For the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> is continually fulfilling in <hi>Providence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I could my ſelf tell you of a <hi>Youth</hi> whom I knew that was once of very Promiſing Hopes, but as he grew to Manhood ſadly diſappointed the Expectations of thoſe who before that <hi>beholding him loved him.</hi> Being ask'd by a religious Friend who was griev'd to ſee ſuch an Alteration in him, "How he had laid out his Life, and intended to ſpend it"?

which being ſeaſonably put in Mind, That the Time of his Life might be ſhorter than he was aware of; He made this Reply. "That he doubted not but he ſhou'd ſee <hi>fourſcore Years</hi> at leaſt." But within that Number of <hi>Days,</hi> he was taken away with the ſtroke of a ſudden &amp; immature Death, in ſuch a Way as made the <hi>Ears of all that heard it to tingle.</hi> Behold now the Severity and goodneſs of God! Towards them who have been taken away by His Stroke, <hi>Righteous Severity;</hi> but towards thee, who art ſtill ſpared and warned, <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> if thou doſt not continue to deſpiſe and abuſe it.</p>
            <p>I have two Things to requeſt of you before you read this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and then I'll no longer detain you. The one is, That you would <hi>pray over it</hi> before you read it; that God would accompany the Reading of it with the Effectual Operation of his Spirit, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the moſt Powerful Words Man can uſe, will be but as <hi>a dead Letter,</hi> altogether ineffectual to Convert &amp; Sanctify you.</p>
            <p>The other is, That after you have read it, You would allow your ſelf Time to <hi>think on what you have read,</hi> and enter into a ſolemn Debate with your own Soul thereupon. Seriouſly ask your ſelf then, "Whether you can think it ſafe to continue in your ſinful Courſes one Day longer?" "Whether it is not the Madneſs of Folly in you, to looſe your Soul, your precious and immortal Soul, rather than part with a baſe Luſt"? "Whether you had not better forego the Company of Sinners now, than have your Soul gather'd with them hereafter"? If any of you ſhould ſtill ſay, <hi>"I have loved Strangers, and after them I will go".</hi> "I muſt indulge my Luſts and enjoy my ſinful Companions, tho' I forfeit the Favour of God, and expoſe my ſelf to his Vengeance for ever". Then, Know it, You wilfully damn your own Soul: You <hi>chuſe Death</hi> in the Cauſes of it. Your <hi>Part</hi> muſt be with <hi>the Unbelieving, and the Abominable, in the Lake that burns with Fire and Brimſtone, which is the ſecond Death.</hi> You <hi>ſhall go</hi> when you die, and that will be very ſoon, <hi>to the Generation of your Fathers,</hi> the unclean Sinners that have died before you, and are ſhut up in the Priſon of Darkneſs; You <hi>ſhall never ſee Light: So ſhall thy Doom be, Thou thy ſelf haſt decided it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that God may bleſs this Diſcourſe to every <hi>one</hi> of you that ſhall read it, to preſerve the <hi>Virtuous</hi> Youth, reclaim the <hi>Vicious,</hi> and eſtabliſh the <hi>Pious;</hi> and ſo make the Preaching and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing it ſerve to heighten the Author's Joy, and brighten his Crown in the Day of CHRIST, is the hearty Prayer of</p>

            <epigraph>

               <q>
                  <hi>They die in Youth, and their Life is among the Unclean. Becauſe there is Wrath, beware leſt He take thee away with his Stroke: then a great Ranſom cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver thee.</hi>

            <p>THE Text is very awful and affecting; deſerves the ſerious Tho'ts of all, but eſpecially challenges a more intenſe Conſideration from our Young People. He that hath an Ear to hear, let him hear. Let theſe ſayings ſink down into your Ears, and be written on your Hearts. By diſcourſing on the Text, may I be ſo happy, by the Bleſſing of GOD, as to prevent the fulfilling of it among our Young People! Of whom I ſee ſo numerous a Concourſe on the preſent ſolemn Occaſion.</p>
            <p>They are the words of <hi>Elihu,</hi> who having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to ſpeak on God's behalf, in Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his dealings with <hi>Job,</hi> firſt gives him (as in the preceeding Context) a brief account of
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:003655_0008_10023E0B069A2F80"/>
the various methods of Providence towards the Children of Men, ſuted to their different Tempers and Carriages towards God; and then gives him agreable Counſels and Admonitions thereupon. <hi>Elihu</hi> obſerves to him the deſign of God in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men under the Bonds of Affliction; that it is with a view to their ſpiritual Benefit, for the good of their Souls, <hi>ver.</hi> 8, 9, 10.—In the next place he obſerves the different Iſſue of a right Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Divine Corrections, and of Impenitence under the Hand of God, <hi>ver.</hi> 11, 12. He fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther amplifies on the Caſe of impenitent Sinners, in the two next Verſes, <hi>ver.</hi> 13, 14.</p>
            <p>And then, after having made ſome particular Remarks on <hi>Job'</hi>s caſe, he proceeds to give him that ſolemn Caution, in the 18<hi>th. verſe,</hi> not to make light of God's Wrath, but to fear leſt he ſhould fall a Sacrifice to the Divine Vengeance. Even good Men have enough amiſs in 'em, to expoſe them to God's Wrath, if He ſhould enter into Judgment with them. It was therefore a proper and ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Caution: and if ſo holy and good a Man, as <hi>Job,</hi> needed ſuch a Caution, ſurely impenitent Sinners much more have need of this ſolemn Warning. It is a Word more eſpecially fit to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs ſecure Sinners withal: tho' 'tis alſo applicable to all others, good as well as bad; young and old.</p>
            <p>'Tis the proper Uſe and Application of the Hint given in the 14<hi>th</hi> verſe, concerning the miſerable End of Impenitents: and therefore I've connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe two Verſes, for the Subject of my preſent Diſcourſe. <hi>They die in Youth, and their Life is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Unclean: Becauſe there is Wrath, &amp;c.</hi>

1. Mankind are ſometimes taken out of the World by an <hi>early Death,</hi> even in the days of their <hi>Youth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Of thoſe, who die in Youth, many there be, <hi>whoſe Life is among the Unclean.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Theſe Reflections ſhould <hi>awaken</hi> all, and particularly young People, to a <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Concern,</hi> leſt God in his Wrath ſhould <hi>take them away with a ſtroke,</hi> leaving them no Hope of Relief.</p>
            <p>DOCT. I. <hi>Mankind are often taken out of the World by an</hi> Early <hi>and</hi> untimely <hi>Death.</hi>—It's the Caſe of many, <hi>They die in Youth,</hi> a premature Death.</p>
            <p>I am aware, That ſome take <hi>Youth</hi> here in a figurative ſenſe, and underſtand the Text to mean, They die in <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Folly.</hi> For he that has not yet learn'd to live as he ought, ſeems to die prematurely: and he that dies prematurely, ſeems to die as an Infant, that can't diſcern its right hand and its left. The old Man, that is a late Penitent, dies a very <hi>Child:</hi> and the Impenitent, though he may have been an hundred Years in the World, yet he has not truly <hi>lived</hi> ſo much as one day, if he at laſt dies in his Sins.</p>
            <p>But others take the Word in a proper ſenſe, as intending the Age of Youth, the Morning of Life. Nor ſee I any Occaſion to depart from the literal Conſtruction.</p>
            <p>It is an obvious Truth, that Multitudes are taken out of the World by an early Death. There are Multitudes, who periſh in the Womb, and never ſee the Light: Multitudes that die in Infancy; having breath'd a few days or months, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire and vaniſh: Multitudes, that die in Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and Youth. Many are taken away in the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:003655_0010_10023E1DD7D79B70"/>
midſt of their Days; and many attain not to this; they ſcarce live out half their Days.</p>
            <p>The longeſt Liver in theſe times may be ſaid to die in Youth, if compared with thoſe in the firſt Ages of the World. Many in primitive times attain'd to nigh a Thouſand Years. But there has ſince been a wonderful Abbreviation of the Life of Man;—of which no Philoſophical Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count has yet been given, to the ſatisfaction of rational Inquirers: but we are oblig'd to content ourſelves with Theological Reaſons, and muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve this myſterious Event into the ſovereign Pleaſure and Providence of God.—From <hi>Moſes'</hi>s time the extent of human Life in general has been but about Seventy or Eighty Years. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90. 10. This is the common Boundary, which few exceed, and Multitudes fall ſhort of.</p>
            <p>Vaſt Numbers (as I ſaid) are taken away in the midſt of their Days, and yet more in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of their Years. The Diſpenſation of early Death is common both to the Juſt and Unjuſt.</p>
            <p>The early Death of the <hi>Righteous</hi> is a <hi>myſterious</hi> Diſpenſation, of which ſcarce any other Account can be given but that, <hi>Even ſo, Father, becauſe it hath ſeemed good in thy ſight!</hi>—However, many Things might be ſaid to juſtify the Providence of God herein; and particularly this, that altho' God ſhortens the days of ſuch in this World, yet he gives them length of Days and Life everlaſting in a better: So that the Curſe is turn'd into a Bleſſing, as to them. Untimely Death is in itſelf evil, and a fruit of the Curſe: but to one in Chriſt, it becomes a ſurpriſing Mercy; for it turns to his Salvation, and haſtens his eternal Happineſs and Glory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:003655_0011_10023DC93A0E26F0"/>
But to the Wicked this Diſpenſation is in <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Shortneſs of Days is often threaten'd in Scripture, as a Puniſhment of Sin. Prov. 10. 27. <hi>The Years of the Wicked ſhall be ſhortned.</hi> So Eccl. 8. 13. <hi>It ſhall not be well with the Wicked; neither ſhall he prolong his Days, which are as a ſhadow, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he feareth not before God.</hi>—And Pſal. 55. 23. <hi>Thou, O God, ſhalt bring them down into the Pit of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: bloody and deceitful Men ſhall not live out half their Days,</hi> i. e. not half the ordinary Age of Man, not half ſo long as they might live in the uſual Courſe of Nature.</p>
            <p>But whether they be righteous or wicked, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be in Mercy or in Judgment, we often ſee very affecting Inſtances of early Death. How many are in their Youth cut off by pining Sickneſs How many by fatal Caſualties! When God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions Death to arreſt any, he regards not the Beauty or the Vigour of Youth: that cannot bribe, nor this reſiſt him. When the Death-Warrant is ſign'd, the King of Terrors becomes inexorable, and ſpares not the ruddy Youth, any more than the hoary Head. He minds not Age or Quality, Sex or Rank: but every one, when his Hour is come, falls by the impartial Hand of this common Devourer. By the Greatneſs of his ſtrength ſhall none prevail: nor will the pitiable Tenderneſs of any obtain a Reprieve for them. The Children and Sucklings he makes to pour out their Soul into their Mother's Boſom: He cruſhes the Young Men with a Rod of Iron, and treads the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Zion, as in a Wine-preſs. In how many Inſtances do we ſee that fulfilled, Job 21. 23, 24. <hi>One dieth in his full ſtrength being wholly at eaſe and quiet, his Breaſts full of Milk, and his Bones moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:003655_0012_10023E5837D7DA48"/>
with Marrow.</hi>—Them that bid faireſt for long Life, how often do we ſee cut off by the ſtroke of Death: Some in the way of Nature, by a fatal Diſtemper; others in the way of Violence, by a ſudden Accident, by the Hand of Malice, or the Sword of Juſtice.</p>
            <p>Herein is the <hi>Sovereignty</hi> of God diſplay'd: and his <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> is herein exalted. For every Death is an Execution of the primitive Curſe, and an Exerciſe of the Divine Dominion over the Life of Man: and in particular early Death is eminently ſo. There is alſo the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God to be ſeen in his ordering Death unto Mankind in all Periods and Ages of Life; inaſmuch as their being at an Uncertainty about the Time of their dying, and not knowing but that they may die in Youth, tends to excite in 'em a Care of early Preparation for Death.</p>
            <p>In a word, while we behold the ſeverity of God to ſome in cutting them off by an untimely Death, We that ſurvive ſhould be more deeply affected with a ſenſe of the diſtinguiſhing goodneſs of God to us, in preſerving us hitherto; eſpecially ſince we have forfeited our Lives by innumerable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations. We have been expos'd to the ſame Perils, as others; we are by Nature Children of Wrath, even as others; our Childhood and Youth has been Vanity, full of Sin and Folly, even more perhaps than many others were guilty of, that have been taken away before us.—And ſhall not theſe Conſiderations ſtrike our Hearts; fill us with Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of the Divine Patience towards us, and lead us to Repentance! O let us devote our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieved Lives to the Honour of God; by whoſe Viſitation out Spirits have been preſerved. Let
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:003655_0013_10023E6A43992480"/>
him have the Service of our adult and advanced Age, to whoſe Mercy it's owing that we did not die in Youth or Infancy. Let that be the Tho't of our Heart, our Reſolution and our Petition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, Pſal. 56. 12, 13. <hi>Thy vows are upon me, O God: I will render praiſes unto thee. For thou haſt delivered my ſoul from death: wilt not thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver my feet from falling, that I may walk before God is the light of the living!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I paſs now to another Obſervation,</p>
            <p>DOCT. II. Of thoſe that die in Youth, many there be, <hi>whoſe Life is amongſt the Unclean.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are different Conſtructions of this Paſſage: Some refer it to the preſent Life, and others to that which is to come.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) We may take it as reſpecting the <hi>preſent Life.</hi> The Word [<hi>is</hi>] not being in the Hebrew Text, our Tranſlators have ſupply'd the Vacancy with that; as perhaps underſtanding <hi>Elihu</hi> to ſpeak here of the Life future. But if it be underſtood of the Life, which now is, there may other Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletives be made uſe of; and accordingly, various Gloſſes may be made on the Words</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thus, it may be read, <hi>Their Life</hi> is ſeen to have been <hi>among the Unclean.</hi> However they may have hid their Wickedneſs heretofore; yet now, when they come to die, they are detect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or confeſs; the Mask is pull'd or thrown off, and it appears they were but whited Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchres, fair without, but foul within. Now the Mouths of Men are open'd to ſpeak what they know of their wicked Lives; the Providence of God ſtrangely brings to Light their hidden Iniquities; or Conſcience compels them to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:003655_0014_10023DCC52354910"/>
The Hypocrite's Hope periſhes in Death, and many times vaniſheth at the Apprehenſion of Death approaching; ſo that the falſe Profeſſor, tho' perhaps he formerly appear'd to have a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Heat of Love and Grace in his Soul, yet now confeſſes himſelf to have been under the power of a fatal Cold in divine Things, &amp; to have poſſeſs'd no other Heat than that of fleſhly Luſts, which war againſt the Soul: and he now numbers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf among the Unclean, calls himſelf a ſpiritual Adulterer, who made Pretenſions of Love to Chriſt, as the Guide of his Youth, but yet only flatter'd him with his Mouth, while in Reality his Heart went a whoring after the World, led away with divers Luſts.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Again, the Text may be read, <hi>Their Life</hi> is found <hi>among the Unclean,</hi> that is, they are found <hi>living in Uncleanneſs,</hi> when Death comes and takes them away. In a State of Sin, and it may be in the Act of Sin, Death ſurprizes 'em, and drives them away in their Wickedneſs. I might inſtance in wicked <hi>Er</hi> and <hi>Onan,</hi> thoſe Brethren in Iniquity, whom the Lord ſlew for their abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Filthineſs, that they died before their Time. So <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> who profaned the Worſhip of God, there went out Fire from the Lord and devoured them, and they died before the Lord. So <hi>Korah</hi> and his Company, Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was amongſt them &amp; in their Dwellings, and the Earth open'd her Mouth, and ſwallow'd them up, and they went down alive into the Pit.—Many are thus cut off by the more immediate hand of God. Others have been ſlain in Battel, or been cut off by the Sword of the civil Magiſtrate, who is a Revenger to execute Wrath upon them that
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:003655_0015_10023DEBE7982390"/>
do Evil. <hi>

               </hi> ſmote <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Cozhi</hi> in the very Act of Lewdneſs.—<hi>Joab</hi> ſlew <hi>Abſalom</hi> in the midſt of his Rebellions.—Others again have been judicially abandon'd of God, ſo as to lay <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Hands</hi> on <hi>themſelves;</hi> as <hi>Judas,</hi> who not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to bear the Shame &amp; Guilt he had bro't on himſelf, went to the Halter for Relief. <hi>Ahito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phel</hi> did the ſame before him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Again, The Text may be read, <hi>Their Life</hi> is taken away <hi>among the Unclean,</hi> i. e. in <hi>Company</hi> with them, or by a Death ignominious as theirs. They are in their Death <hi>number'd among the Tranſgreſſors:</hi> Cut off for their Sins, by a ſhameful Execution, as Criminals. They are cut off <hi>after the manner</hi> of unclean Perſons, by an infamous Death. The original Word in our Text, for <hi>the Unclean,</hi> is in other places frequently render'd <hi>Sodomites:</hi> and ſome read it, Their Life <hi>is cut off after the ſame Manner as Sodomites</hi> are cut off, that are moſt hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully unclean, abominably wicked, i. e. by a vile and ſhameful Death. As if it had been ſaid, They die in Youth, and come to an ignominious End.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Finally, If we read it thus, <hi>Their Life</hi> is taken away <hi>among the Unclean,</hi> it may intend, they die <hi>like</hi> the worſt of Sinners, as to their <hi>Frame</hi> and <hi>Carriage.</hi> The Hypocrites in heart, of whom <hi>Elihu</hi> had been ſpeaking, often make as poor a figure in the Approaches of Death, as the openly Profane: they behave no better than the moſt foul and ſcandalous Sinners; either dying under the power of brutiſh Stupidity, or elſe in helliſh Deſpair. <hi>Balaam'</hi>s Wiſh was wont to be theirs, That they might die the <hi>Death of the Righteous:</hi> but alas! how often do we ſee, that the Hypocrite
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:003655_0016_100202625D1DF6D8"/>
dieth <hi>as the Fool dieth,</hi> either in ſottiſh Security, or in miſerable Anguiſh and deſponding Rage?</p>
            <p>Having thus conſider'd the Words in various Lights, as they are underſtood to refer unto the preſent Life; I come now</p>
            <p n="2">(2) To give you another Gloſs upon the Text, which refers the Life here ſpoken of unto the <hi>future State.</hi> And I find ſome of the moſt judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Expoſitors underſtanding it in this Senſe: <hi>Their Life is among the Unclean,</hi> i. e. their <hi>future</hi> Life is ſo: the Life of their Souls in the ſeparate State is, and the Life of their Bodies in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection-State ſhall be, among the Unclean; among <hi>Sodomites,</hi> in the <hi>everlaſting Fire</hi> The fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Sinners of <hi>Sodom</hi> who gave themſelves over to Fornication, and went after ſtrange Fleſh, are ſaid (<hi>Jude</hi> 7<hi>th</hi>) to be <hi>ſet forth for an Example, ſuffering the Vengeance of eternal Fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The vain and lewd Youth, that dies in his Sins, yea the moſt moral and virtuous Youth, that dies out of Chriſt, unpardon'd and unrenew'd in the Spirit of his mind, muſt have his Portion with the unclean Spirits in Hell. <hi>When he giveth up the Ghoſt, where is he?</hi> Whither does he go? Not to Paradiſe, but to a Priſon. We read of the <hi>Spirits in Priſon,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 19. It means damned Souls in Hell.—Heaven is a holy Place; and <hi>there ſhall in no wiſe enter into it any thing that defileth, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whatſoever worketh Abomination, or maketh a Lie,</hi> Rev. 21. 27. Hell is the only fit Receptacle of impure Souls: thither, when ſuch depart from the Body, they go, as to <hi>their own place,</hi> their proper Centre. <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 25. Now among them that die <hi>in Youth,</hi> as well as in other Ages of Life there are many that die in their Sins, and their Life

afterwards is among the Unclean. They lie down in Sorrow; and in Hell they lift up their Eyes, being in Torments.—There they bear the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of their Youth. God in Anger now writes bitter Things indeed againſt them, &amp; makes them to poſſeſs the Iniquities of their Youth: theſe, which once were as ſweet Morſels in their Mouth, are as the Gall of Aſps to them now. Bitter, bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter are their Reflections on loſt Time, on the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpence of Youth, the golden Opportunity of Life, and the <hi>only</hi> Opportunity (as it prov'd) to them. Conſcience now laſhes terribly, and reads the moſt doleful Leſſons to them. They ſee an amazing ETERNITY before 'em, &amp; have a certain fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful looking for of Judgment and fiery Indignation to devour them for ever and ever. They were <hi>cut down out of Time</hi> (as the Phraſe is <hi>Job.</hi> 22. 16) their Life was <hi>ſoon cut off,</hi> and their Souls flew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: But alas! the days that were wanting on Earth, are made up in Hell. He that dies in Youth, with his Sins unpardon'd and unrepented of, enters immediately upon a never-expiring State of Woe &amp; Miſery, Sorrow &amp; Deſpair. His ſhort Life of Sin here is follow'd with a long (long) Eternity of Sufferings &amp; Torment. And in <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion</hi> to their Guilt, is the future Puniſhment of Sinners greater or leſs. They that have periſhed from under the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> ſhall have a more intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Damnation, than even the Sinners of <hi>Sodom</hi> and the heathen World. And ſuch under the Goſpel as have contracted the greateſt Degrees of Guilt, ſhall have the moſt aggravated Puniſhment. They that carry out of the World with them moſt of the Temper &amp; Complexion of Hell, ſhall have the greateſt ſhare of the Pains &amp; Torments of Hell.

Reward her even as ſhe rewarded you, and double unto her double, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her works: in the cup which ſhe hath filled, fill to her double. How much ſhe hath glorified her ſelf, and lived deliciouſly, ſo much torment and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row give her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O let us all realiſe it, that when ever we ſhall die, whether in Youth or Age, if we be found in our <hi>Sins,</hi> if we go out of the World unpardoned &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent, our Life in the future State muſt be <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Unclean,</hi> among filthy and abhorred Spirits, in a State of Puniſhment to everlaſting. Devils and Unclean Spirits only will be fit Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions for us: Hell only will be a fit Habitation for us:—And the moſt horrid Abodes there will be aſſign'd unto <hi>us,</hi> as being the Chief of Sinners.</p>
            <p>And now being warned, ſhall we not be moved with Fear, and be in Concern of Soul that this may not be our miſerable Lot, when we die, to have our Life among the Unclean! O let us be perſwaded by the Terrors of the Lord, and haſten our Flight from impending Vengeance.—But to excite and direct your Care and Endeavour, in this Regard, will be my Buſineſs under the laſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation; which therefore I now come to.—</p>
            <p>DOCT. III. <hi>Theſe Reflections</hi> ſhould awaken all, and in particular <hi>Young</hi> People, to a juſt <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Care,</hi> left GOD in Wrath ſhould <hi>take them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with his Stroke,</hi> beyond hope of Relief.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:003655_0019_10020260C22122B0"/>
               <hi>They die in Youth, and their Life is among the Unclean: Becauſe there is Wrath, beware leſt he take thee away</hi> &amp;c. q. d. Becauſe you ſee the Wrath of God ſignalized in terrible Judgments on <hi>others,</hi> cutting them down by Death, and ſending them into the Pit; and becauſe you have reaſon to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the Wrath of God kindled againſt you, by his preſent afflictive Diſpenſations: O beware, leſt he proceed to cut <hi>you</hi> down alſo by an awful Death, and ſo you appear to die &amp; periſh, even as the vileſt Sinner by the hand of Vengeance.—Or it may mean, Becauſe there is <hi>a Wrath to come,</hi> Treaſures of Wrath reſerv'd in Hell for impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Sinners; Beware that you be not found in this unhappy Number, and ſo when you die, your Lot be among the Unclean.</p>
            <p>Beware leſt God in Wrath cut you off <hi>with his Stroke,</hi> in a Day that you look not for it, in an Hour that you are not aware of. Don't be cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Peace &amp; Safety to your ſelf, leſt ſudden De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction come upon you, as Travail upon a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with Child, and there be no Eſcaping. Boaſt not thy ſelf of to morrow; for thou knoweſt not what a Day may bring forth.</p>
            <p>And as a further Motive of Fear, conſider, if God ſhould cut you off with his Stroke, there will be no Hope of Relief; <hi>Then a great Ranſom can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deliver thee:</hi> which may refer, either to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery from the Grave, or a Redemption from Hell. When Men are <hi>once dead,</hi> there's no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning into this Life and World: Do with Might therefore what your Hand findeth to do, leſt Death ſurprize you in an unprepared State, and that Night come upon you unawares, in which no Man can work.—And when Sinners have once
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:003655_0020_10023E6BD39CC080"/>
ſhot the Gulph and are ſhut up in <hi>Hell,</hi> there's no Eſcaping, no Diſcharge for ever. <hi>O what ſhall a Man give in Exchange for his Soul?</hi> Had you the whole World at your Command, it would not be a ſufficient Price for the Ranſom of your Soul. Neither will all your Tears, Cries and Promiſes avail any thing: Divine Juſtice will be inexora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to you. Neither will you have any Advocate to plead for you: He who is the only prevailing Advocate with the Father, will then be turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you; His Blood, which now ſpeaks better Things than the Blood of <hi>Abel,</hi> will then plead a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, and loudly imprecate divine Vengeance upon you to all Eternity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now is the accepted Time; Now is the Day of Salvation:</hi> O ſee that you refuſe it not. <hi>How will you eſcape, if you neglect ſo great Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!</hi>—Tremble, leſt God ſhould cut you off with his Stroke, while you are delaying to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept this Salvation. <hi>Then a great Ranſom cannot deliver you:</hi> Even the great and the only valuable Ranſom, that which Chriſt paid down for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Souls, will then be of no Benefit to you: for its ſaving Virtue is applicable only in this World; it reaches not to the Priſon of Hell. Not that it is not in it ſelf ſufficient; for it has an infinite intrinſecal Value and Vertue: but in the Application 'tis limited by the Wiſdom and Sovereignty of God, who has made this tranſient Life the Seaſon of Probation for a future ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting State.</p>
            <p>Surely then it is a matter of infinite Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to us, that we now uſe the utmoſt Care to ſecure to our ſelves eternal Salvation, and make ſure of being deliver'd from the Wrath to come.
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:003655_0021_10023E3CC66DE790"/>
We ſhould work out our Salvation with Fear and Trembling. It may well be our fear, leſt a Promiſe being left us of entring into Reſt, we ſhould after all come ſhort of it.</p>
            <p>I might ſay here,—We ſhould beware of <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Security</hi> and Preſumption, and of every Thing that tends to nouriſh a careleſs Temper or falſe Hopes, which will hinder us in preparing for the future State.</p>
            <p>We ſhould beware of <hi>criminal Courſes,</hi> and Ways of Sin and Wickedneſs, which tend to kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the Anger of God againſt us, and provoke him to bring everlaſting Deſtruction upon us.</p>
            <p>We ſhould beware of <hi>Hypocriſy</hi> in Religion; which will make us a Loathing to the holy Heart-ſearching God, and provoke him to ſpue us out of his Mouth with Indignation.</p>
            <p>In a Word, Whatever we do, we muſt be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to ſecure an Intereſt in Chriſt, who only ſaves from the Wrath to come; and therefore beware of <hi>an evil Heart of Unbelief.</hi> By reaſon of Sin, we are by nature Children of Wrath: and if ever we be reconciled to God, his Wrath muſt be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed toward us, by an Application of the Blood of Chriſt, which cleanſeth from all Unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: and this Application is thro' Faith. Hence then we muſt make it our Care to get and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe Faith in Chriſt. We muſt beware, that we don't miſs of Life thro' Unbelief; beware that we don't deceive our ſelves with a dead Faith; beware of carnal Prejudices againſt Chriſt, and the way of Salvation by him. We muſt realiſe our Need of a Saviour, and the infinite Sufficiency and gracious Willingneſs of Chriſt to be our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour: We muſt ſubmit to and entertain him in
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:003655_0022_10023DEE5B522400"/>
all his Offices; Commit our Souls into his redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hands, to be cloath'd with his Righteouſneſs, and adorn'd with his Image, to be waſhed, juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd and ſanctify'd, and ſav'd for ever. So ſhall we find Chriſt a Refuge for us in the day of Death, a Security from the Wrath to come. For whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever believeth in the Son, hath everlaſting Life: Whereas he that believeth not, <hi>ſhall not ſee Life, but the Wrath of God abideth on him,</hi> Joh. 3. 36.</p>
            <p>I come now to the APPLICATION.</p>
            <p>And here,</p>
            <p>USE I. Is it ſo, that many <hi>die in Youth,</hi> whoſe Life is among the Unclean? O with what Aſtoniſhment ſhould <hi>old Sinners</hi> reflect on the <hi>ſparing</hi> Goodneſs of God <hi>to them:</hi> and what need have they to <hi>haſten</hi> their Repentance and Turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God!</p>
            <p>Are there not ſome of you, who may be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called (in reſpect of corrupt Practice, as well as a vitiated Nature) Tranſgreſſors from the Womb! Who have a Childhood and Youth to look back upon, that were full of Vanity, Sin and Folly; and as if this were not enough, have ſpent your maturer Years in Sin, and are even ſtill going on in your Treſpaſſes; Increaſing in Sin, as you increaſe in Age. Are there not <hi>many</hi> Sins, which you have to reflect on; <hi>heinous</hi> Sins, Sins againſt the Light, againſt Warnings and Convictions, againſt Vows and Reſolutions; Sins often repeated, long continued in, and dreadfully aggravated: And yet God has ſpared you hitherto! You have ſeen many fall on your right Hand &amp; on your left: and ſtill <hi>you've</hi> been reprieved. You may well wonder,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:003655_0023_10023E030DDAD448"/>
and be aſtoniſh'd, that you are as yet on this ſide the Grave, and out of Hell. Why did not you die, even as many others, in Youth! Is it not a merciful of God, that has made you to differ! O the Riches of Divine Patience toward you! Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire and magnify it: be affected with it, and improve it to Repentance, leſt ere long abuſed Mercy turn into enraged Juſtice. The longeſt Liver ſurely muſt die at laſt: and thinkeſt thou this, O Man that art an old Practitioner in Sin, that thou ſhalt eſcape the Judgment of God? Or deſpiſeſt thou the Riches of his Goodneſs &amp; For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance; not knowing that the Goodneſs of God leadeth thee to Repentance? O do not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thy Hardneſs and impenitent Heart perſiſt in Rebellions againſt God, and Neglects of thy Soul; treaſuring up Wrath againſt the Day of Wrath. Hear that Divine Reproof and Warning, Eccl. 8. 11,—13. <hi>Becauſe Sentence againſt an evil Work is not executed ſpeedily, therefore the Heart of the Sons of men is fully ſet in them to do Evil:</hi> But <hi>tho' a Sinner do Evil an hundred times, and his Days be prolonged; yet ſurely it ſhall not be well with the Wicked</hi> in the End.—<hi>Eccl.</hi> 6. 3. If a man live many years, and his <hi>Soul be not filled with Good, I ſay that an untimely Birth is better than he.</hi> It is an awful Threatning, in Iſai. 65. 20. <hi>The Sinner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an hundred years old, ſhall be accurſed.</hi> O that this Word might ſtrike an Awe and faſten upon the Heart of every fooliſh One, whoſe hoary Head is a Shame to him, being found in the way of Unrighteouſneſs! Flatter not your ſelf with the Thought of finding-Mercy and dying in Peace, tho' you go on a little longer in your Sins. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is Wrath,</hi> Treaſures of Wrath heaped
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:003655_0024_10023E6E53506D70"/>
up by your long Life of Sin, <hi>beware leſt God take you away with his Stroke: then a great Ranſom can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deliver you.</hi> But his Anger will ſmoke againſt you, and all the Curſes of his violated Law be pour'd on your guilty Head. If impenitent Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, dying in <hi>Youth,</hi> have their Life among the <hi>Unclean;</hi> where ſhall the <hi>old</hi> Sinner appear? Can you expect any better Doom? Verily if you at laſt die impenitent, full of Days, and full of Sins, you will be of all Men the moſt miſerable: the day of Death will be a day of Wrath, &amp; the day of Judgment, a day of terrible Vengeance, unto you above all others. O conſider, before it be too late. It is high time to awake out of Sleep. Give glory to God, before your Feet ſtumble upon the dark Mountains. It is the Admonition of Heaven to you, Eccl. 11. 8. <hi>If a Man live many days, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in them all, yet let him remember the days of Darkneſs; for they ſhall be many.</hi>—O take Heed leſt that come upon you, Job 20. 11, &amp; 27. <hi>His bones are full of the ſin of his youth, which ſhall lie down with him in the duſt. The heaven ſhall reveal his iniquity: and the earth ſhall riſe up againſt him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>USE II. Do many die in Youth, whoſe Life is among the Unclean? Here then is a moving Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to awaken <hi>Parents</hi> unto an <hi>early</hi> Care and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Prayer for their <hi>Children,</hi> that they may be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted betimes:</hi> and <hi>no Wonder,</hi> pious Parents are full of <hi>Sorrow</hi> and <hi>Fear,</hi> when they ſee their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren <hi>hardning</hi> their Hearts &amp; growing in Sin, as they grow in Years, notwithſtanding all their Pains and Prayers for and with them.</p>
            <p>God has put into Parents a natural Affection to the Fruit of their own Body; ſo that they are ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:003655_0025_10023E5A99A22DF8"/>
concern'd for the Welfare of their Children. Tho' they be <hi>evil,</hi> they <hi>know how to give good Gifts to their Children:</hi> to nouriſh their Bodies, to defend 'em from Harms, and provide for 'em a Portion in this Life.—But now let me mind you, that are Parents, of the Duty you owe to the <hi>Souls</hi> of your dear Children. O let not all your Concern for 'em terminate on the outward Man, and centre on the low and mean Things of this tranſitory World. Remember, your Children are Children of <hi>Death,</hi> and Children of <hi>Wrath</hi> by Nature; They are bound for another World; They may die in <hi>Youth:</hi> They may, if let alone to go on in their Sins, come to an <hi>infamous</hi> End, and bring you to Shame: and if they die in their natural State, their Life in another World will be among the <hi>Unclean;</hi> not among the Saints in Light, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the pure and bleſſed Spirits in Heaven, but among the filthy accurſed Spirits in a miſerable Hell.—And can you bear the Tho't of this! Do not your Bowels now yearn within you for 'em! Will not a Father pity his Children, or can a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forget to have Compaſſion on the Son of her Womb!—O pity the periſhing Souls of your poor Children. Fear the Sin and Doom of <hi>Eli;</hi> who, when his Sons made themſelves vile, reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them not, and God judged his Houſe by cutting off all the Increaſe of it in the Flower of their Age. O ſave your Children with fear: <hi>plucking them as Brands out of the Fire.</hi> Mourn their Sins: mourn their guilty, polluted, miſerable &amp; expoſed State by Nature. Realiſe their Need of a ſanctifying Change: and let it be your firſt and great Care for them, that they may be born again; without which they can never ſee the Kingdom of Heaven.
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:003655_0026_10023E7008B7CFC0"/>
Let it be your Heart's Deſire and Prayer to God for them, and your continual Endeavour, in the uſe of appointed Means, that they may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted betimes. Begin <hi>early</hi> with them, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low 'em inceſſantly with your pious Inſtructions, Counſels, Reproofs, and Warnings. Charge 'em, as <hi>David</hi> did his Son <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 Chron. 28. 9. <hi>And thou, Solomon my ſon, know thou the God of thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſerve him with a perfect heart, and with a willing mind; for the Lord ſearcheth all hearts, and underſtandeth all the imaginations of the tho'ts: if thou ſeek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou forſake him, he will caſt thee off for ever.</hi> Set an holy <hi>Example</hi> before 'em; walking in your Houſe with a perfect Heart.—And to enforce Means and Endeavours, Offer up fervent <hi>Prayers</hi> to the God of all Grace, that he would by his Spirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get your Children to a new &amp; divine Life.—Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> pray'd, <hi>O that Iſhmael might live in thy ſight!</hi> Gen. 17. 18. So <hi>David,</hi> 1 Chron. 29. 19. <hi>Give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Solomon my ſon a perfect heart to keep thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</hi> And if you obtain this for 'em, you will have Joy in them, ſuppoſing they live to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Years: or if they die in Youth, you will have this for your Conſolation, the Hope that their Life in the World of Spirits, is not among the Unclean, but among the Perfected in Glory.</p>
            <p>And as to you, who have Children adult or growing up, but cannot ſee them under any hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Impreſſions; <hi>no Wonder,</hi> if you are bow'd down with Sorrow for them and go mourning all the day. Ah! Your Hearts may well meditate Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, when you think what miſerable Circumſtances they may bring themſelves by Sin into even here, and that if they ſhould die in Youth, unconverted
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:003655_0027_10023DF061BF2CE8"/>
and unpardon'd, they muſt be undone, for ever undone; muſt have their Life among the Unclean in a future State, and become a Prey to the worſt of all Devourers. How can your Minds but be in Pain! How can you but be full of Anxiety and Anguiſh; to ſee your Children hardning their Hearts in Sin, careleſs of their Souls, &amp; taking Methods to haſten on themſelves Deſtruction without a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy! Alas, What tender and ſerious Parent can ſee this without a weeping Eye, and bleeding Heart!—Yet let your Sorrow and your Fear be kept within due Bounds, and under a holy Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. Duty is yours; the Event is God's. Whatever your Fears are, don't ſlacken your Pains or Prayers. I propound that Example of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout and watchful Parent to you, Job. 1. 5. <hi>And it was ſo, when the days of their feaſting were gone about, that Job ſent and ſanctified them, and roſe up early in the morning, and offered burnt-offerings ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the number of them all: for Job ſaid, It may be that my ſons have ſinned, and curſed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>USE III. Is it ſo, that many die in Youth, whoſe Life is among the Unclean? How aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is the <hi>Stupidity</hi> and <hi>Security</hi> of wicked &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Young People! How <hi>fooliſh</hi> &amp; <hi>mad</hi> their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Mirth and Jollity in ways of Sin! Sure I am, they have little Reaſon to rejoyce in Iniquity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sin</hi> is the moſt unprofitable Thing in the World; yea, the moſt dangerous and injurious. It tends to wound the Name, ruin the Eſtate, deſtroy the Body, and damn the Soul.—However Fools may make a mock at Sin, and put far away the evil Day; however it may be an Abomination
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:003655_0028_10023E5DCF8AA728"/>
to Fools to depart from their wicked ways: yet ſurely Evil purſueth Sinners, and Wo to them that are at Eaſe in Zion. Wo to you that laugh now; for ye ſhall mourn at the laſt. The Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Sin are but for a Seaſon: they are ſhort in their Duration, brutiſh in their Nature, and bane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in their Conſequence. How often do we ſee the Wicked fall by their own wickedneſs; the Backſlider in Heart filled with his own Ways, and Tranſgreſſors taken in their own Naughtineſs! Oh how often do we ſee the Lamp of the wicked put out! the Simple paſs on and are puniſhed. How many loſe their Lives in the Purſuit of ſinful Pleaſures! How many loſe their Souls! How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny by this means bring Shame and Ruin on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in this World, and everlaſting Contempt and Miſery in the future!</p>
            <p>And yet notwithſtanding the Warnings given by others Harms; notwithſtanding the Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions given by God in his Providence, and in his Word; alas! Are there not many of our young People that have fellowſhip with the unfruitful Works of Darkneſs, ſerving divers Luſts &amp; Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures? O the Folly you are guilty of! We mourn your Folly: We pity you as Children void of Wiſdom. You are your own Enemies: you are deſtroying yourſelves, Soul and Body. You ſeem to love Death, and court Deſtruction. You are taking the ſureſt Methods to ſhorten your Days in this World, and to haſten your Damnation in the next. And yet (amazing!) you dwell at Eaſe, as if you were in no Hazard. You appear loſt to the Reflections of reaſonable Creatures. Surely you have not the Underſtanding of Men: but may juſtly be compar'd to the Brutes, that have no

Prov. 9. 17, 18. <hi>Stollen waters are ſweet, and bread eaten in ſecret is pleaſant. But he knoweth not that the dead are there; and that her gueſts are in the depths of hell.</hi> Surely <hi>Madneſs</hi> is in their Heart while they live, who to enjoy the Pleaſures of Sin, will expoſe their Souls, their precious and immortal Souls, to the Hazard of being gather'd with Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in Hell, when they die.</p>
            <p>How can you now think of this, and not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid! Or are you more brutiſh than the Beaſts that periſh! Be aſtoniſh'd, O Heavens, at this! Be horribly afraid, O Earth!</p>
            <p>USE IV. From what has been ſaid, we may infer the <hi>Happineſs,</hi> and the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of ſuch as are <hi>cleanſing their way</hi> and <hi>fearing</hi> God in their Youth.</p>
            <p>Thro' the Grace of Chriſt, we truſt, there is a Number of Young People of this Character a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us:—tho' (alas) but a ſmall Remnant. And to ſuch I would bring this day the Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God, after the Leſſons of Terror that have been uttered.</p>

Know it then, ſuch of you as are indeed ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God and following after Righteouſneſs, you are taking a happy method to obtain long Life in this World, and eternal Life in the next.—You are the moſt likely to live long on the Earth: for as we read Prov. 10. 27. The <hi>Fear of the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth Days.</hi> It hath a natural Tendency to do ſo, Chap 11. 19. <hi>Righteouſneſs tendeth to Life.</hi> And Godlineſs hath the <hi>Promiſe</hi> of the Life, which now is. Prov. 14. 10. <hi>Receive my Sayings, and the Years of thy Life ſhall be many.</hi>—Chap 9. 10, 11. <hi>The Fear of the Lord is the beginning of Wiſdom:—for by me thy Days ſhall be multiplied, and the Years of thy Life ſhall be increaſed.</hi>—However, if God ſhould ſee good to take you away in Youth, you will be able by his Grace to reſign chearfully to his Will; having overcome the World by Faith, you will be ſatisfy'd with Life, whether longer or ſhorter. And the earlier you die, you will but the ſooner get to your Reward in Heaven. If you do but give Diligence in the Work of God, you may live long in a little Time: and tho' in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Age, you may die a very Child, yet in reſpect of ſpiritual Attainments, you may be ſaid to die an <hi>hundred years old.</hi> (Iſa. 65. 20.) And the Promiſe of long Life ſhall be gloriouſly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd to you in a better World. When you die, you ſhall enter into Life; Life eternal; a Life as happy, as long: Not among the Unclean; but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt holy Angels &amp; glorify'd Saints in Heaven: a Life of Communion with the bleſſed God in ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Joy for evermore. O the <hi>Conſolation,</hi> that this ſhould be to you now, under all the Troubles of this mutable World, and under the Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of haſtning Death and Judgment! And the
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:003655_0031_10023E0DB07810D8"/>
               <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of your preſent Conduct from hence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly appears. We read, Prov. 28 7. <hi>Whoſo keepeth the Law is a wiſe ſon.</hi> He is truly a wiſe Child, that fears God, that ſeeks Chriſt <hi>betimes;</hi> whoſe Loving-kindneſs is better than Life. Such a Youth minds the one Thing needful; regards his trueſt Intereſt; has the beſt End in View, and the beſt Means in Uſe. He takes the ſureſt Method to promote his own Uſefulneſs and Comfort in the preſent, and ſecure his eternal Happineſs in the coming World. Surely the Knowledge of the Holy is Underſtanding. Better is a poor &amp; <hi>wiſe Child,</hi> than an old and <hi>fooliſh King,</hi> however great and rich. O what Praiſes are due to the Grace of God in Chriſt, who has made you to differ, made you to excel! By his Grace alone it is, that you are what you are, in reſpect of every good thing found in you, towards the Lord your God.—And he expects ſingular Returns from you in ways of Gratitude, Love, and Obedience. Be much in meditating &amp; admiring the Diſtinction, ſovereign Divine Mercy has put upon you; that while thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of others are made Pillars of Salt for the glory of vindictive Juſtice, you are among the bright Monuments of ſaving Grace, and belong to that happy Number, in whom Chriſt, when he comes, ſhall be glorify'd, and admired for ever. Let it be your ſolicitous Study now to bring all poſſible Honour to Chriſt, in a way of Obedience to his Goſpel. Ye were ſometimes Darkneſs, but now are Light in the Lord: walk as Children of Light. See that you walk circumſpectly, not as Fools, but as wiſe. Beware that the way of Truth be not evil ſpoken of on your account: let not that worthy Name, by which you are call'd, be
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:003655_0032_10023E405336B380"/>
blaſphemed thro' you at any time. Remember how <hi>David</hi> ſinned in the matter of <hi>Uriah,</hi> by which he gave Occaſion to the Enemies of the Lord to blaſpheme, and for which God was diſpleaſed with him. Take Warning from his Example: Watch and pray, that ye enter not into Temptation. Falls into Sin will coſt you a bitter Repentance, &amp; may draw down heavy Corrections upon you, in order to bring you to Repentance, that you may not be condemned with the World. Let the Life you now live in the fleſh, be <hi>by the Faith of the Son of God:</hi> Truſt in him to keep you from the Evil; and you may hope to be deliver'd from every evil Work, and preſerved to his heavenly Kingdom.</p>

before him, when once he is angry?</hi> O beware then of the Wrath of God: beware of every Thing that tends to kindle againſt you this conſuming Fire.</p>
            <p>You ſhould be afraid of humane Juſtice, the Wrath of the civil Magiſtrate. <hi>For Rulers are a Terror, not to good Works, but to evil: wilt thou then not be afraid of the Power? If thou do that which is evil, be afraid: for he beareth not the Sword in vain: for he is the Miniſter of God, a Revenger to execute Wrath upon him that doth Evil,</hi> Rom. 13 3, 4.</p>
            <p>But you ſhould above all be afraid of Divine Juſtice, the Wrath of the ſupreme Ruler: into whoſe Hands it is a moſt fearful thing for any to fall. Job 19 29. <hi>Be ye afraid of the Sword; for Wrath bringeth the Puniſhments of the Sword, that ye may know there is a Judgment.</hi> It was the ſaying of <hi>Job,</hi> God knoweth the Way that I take; <hi>when I conſider, I am afraid of him</hi> And <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>My Fleſh trembleth for Fear of God; I am afraid of his Judgments.</hi> And will not <hi>you</hi> be afraid?

O conſider, and beware. <hi>Becauſe there is Wrath, beware leſt he take thee away with his Stroke.</hi> Beware of every grievous and provoking Evil: beware of undoing Ignorance and Error, of Impiety and Profaneneſs, of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality and Vice, of carnal Security and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy! Upon each of theſe Heads diſtinctly I ſhall now give ſome ſhort and ſolemn Lectures of Caution: to which, in the Name of God, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand an awaken'd Attention.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Beware of undoing <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Error.</hi>

Theſe are Snares of the Devil, by which many Souls are captivated, and held under the Power of Satan, until the Arrows of Death diſpatch 'em out of the World, and ſend 'em down to the Chains of Darkneſs in Hell, without a Remedy. O be upon your Guard, ſtudy and watch and pray, that your Souls be not enſnar'd and undone by fatal Ignorance or Error.</p>
            <p>Beware of undoing <hi>Ignorance.</hi> As you love your Souls, and wou'd ſave them from Deſtruction, be careful to get neceſſary Knowledge; I mean, in Things ſpiritual and Divine. <hi>That the Soul be without Knowledge, it is not good;</hi> it is not ſafe. Groſly ignorant Souls are capable of doing but little Good, and of getting but little Good. They are expos'd to innumerable Evils, and fall an eaſy Prey to the ſubtil Adverſary of Souls. It was GOD's Complaint in old time, <hi>My People are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd for lack of Knowledge.</hi> Take heed that this be not <hi>your</hi> Ruin. It may be you think there's little danger of it, in this Land of Light: perhaps you are puffed up with a vain Conceit of your Attainments in Divine Knowledge. But I would mind you of that of the Apoſtle, <hi>If any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet, as he ought to know it.</hi> And may it not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd as to many, <hi>When for the Time,</hi> and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages you've had, ye might be qualify'd to be <hi>Teachers, ye have Need that one teach you again which be the firſt Principles of the Oracles of God! Some have not the Knowledge of God: I ſpeak this to your Shame.</hi> O take heed, leſt ye be found <hi>worſhipping ye know not what.</hi> Take heed, leſt as concerning one Goſpel-Truth or Precept and another, that Charge lie againſt you, <hi>Of this ye are willingly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant.</hi>

If you would eſcape the <hi>Pollutions</hi> of the World, it muſt be through the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of God and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt. He that is blind, cannot ſee afar off, to eſpy and avoid Dangers. He that walketh in Darkneſs, knoweth not whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he goeth, nor how to ſhun the Stumbling-blocks before him. Thro' Knowledge ſhall the Juſt be deliver'd: but he that hateth Knowledge, is brutiſh; and no wonder if the brutiſh Perſon pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh. How often is ſhame the Promotion of Fools, and a miſerable Death the Wages of affected Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance! O do not deſpiſe your Souls, by refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Inſtruction; leſt it be your awful Puniſhment <hi>to die without Inſtruction,</hi> and go into Blackneſs of Darkneſs for ever. How long, ye ſimple ones, will ye love Simplicity, and Fools hate Knowledge? <hi>Be ye not as the Horſe and the Mule, without Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding:</hi> leſt you be left in the greatneſs of your Folly to go aſtray, and run blindfold to an untime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Death and eternal Deſtruction; as the <hi>Ox goeth to the Slaughter,</hi> or as a <hi>Bird haſtneth to the Snare,</hi> and <hi>knoweth not that it is for his Life.</hi>

this day of abounding Errors, ſome of the moſt Soul-concerning Truths are by many call'd in Queſtion, yea exploded with Deriſion: and the contrary <hi>ungodly Principles</hi> eagerly embrac'd and zealouſly diſſeminated; even ſuch as may well make our Ears tingle to hear them. O <hi>beware that ye be not led away with the Errors of the Wicked,</hi> and make Shipwrack of Faith and a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. I am jealous over you, O our Young Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in this giddy Period of your Life and in theſe Times of growing Infidelity and Hereſy; I fear leſt by any means as the Serpent beguiled Eve thro' his Subtilty, ſo your Minds ſhould be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted from the Simplicity that is in Chriſt, and be removed to another Goſpel; which yet is not another:—for ſome are already turned aſide af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Satan, and they lie in wait to ſeduce others, to beguile unſtable Souls. O take Heed, and let no Man deceive you with vain Words. Be not Children, toſſed to and fro, and carry'd about with every Wind of Doctrine, by the ſlight of Men, and cunning Stratagems, whereby they lie in wait to deceive. Whatever Flouts you may hear at <hi>Orthodoxy,</hi> as a matter of no Significance; yet realiſe it, that, 'tis thro' Sanctification of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and <hi>Belief of the Truth,</hi> we are choſen to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Realiſe it, there are <hi>Doctrines of Devils,</hi> helliſh Errors, impious, profane and malignant; which <hi>eat as doth a Canker,</hi> have a corrupt Influence into the Heart and Life, and are of fatal Conſequence. Be exhorted then to take Heed of Seducers; mark them which cauſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions and Offences contrary to the Doctrine which ye have learned, the Doctrine of Chriſt, the Faith once deliver'd to the Saints; mark ſuch, and avoid

Beware of indulging your ſelves in carnal Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings againſt the Myſteries of Divine Revelation, however incomprehenſible: Beware of indulging a ſecret Enmity to Goſpel-Truths, however hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and mortifying to Fleſh &amp; Blood, and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever unreputable in an Age of prevailing Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Vice. Take heed that worldly Intereſt, or Applauſe with Men, do not bribe you in favour of any Error, when it is become faſhionable or popular. Take heed, that you don't run into any Error grateful to a proud or worldly and ſenſual Mind, for the eaſing a wounded Conſcience, and ſtifling of Convictions. In a Word, Beware of grieving the Holy Spirit by practically denying the Faith, leſt He be provoked to give you up to a Spirit of Error; leave you to fall into <hi>damnable Hereſies;</hi> and bring on your ſelves <hi>ſwift Deſtruction.</hi> As it is written, <hi>They received not the Love of the Truth, that they might be ſaved: and for this cauſe God ſhall ſend them ſtrong Deluſion, that they ſhould believe a Lie; that they all might be damned, who believed not the Truth, but had Pleaſure in Unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</hi> Take Heed leſt that come upon you; <hi>Even as they did not like to retain God in their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> but became vain in their Imaginations, <hi>God gave them over</hi> to a reprobate Mind, and unto vile Affections, to do thoſe things which are <hi>worthy of Death.</hi> O our young People, as you would avoid the <hi>ways of Death,</hi> as you wou'd ſhun the <hi>paths of the Deſtroyer,</hi> beware that you be not found walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the paths of <hi>Error</hi> and <hi>Ignorance.</hi>—This was the firſt Caution.</p>

            <p>Take good Heed unto your ſelves that ye love the Lord your God; that ye be Worſhippers of God, and confeſs Chriſt before Men. However orthodox and knowing in Religion you may be; yet take Care that you do not ſatisfy yourſelves with a mere ſpeculative Belief of the Truth; ſeparate from agreable Impreſſions on the Heart and practical Acknowledgments in the Life. Take heed leſt that be fulfilled in you; <hi>They are without Excuſe, becauſe that when they knew God, they glorify'd him not as God, neither were thankful.</hi> Take heed that you do not caſt off Fear, and reſtrain Prayer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God; that you don't neglect ſecret Prayer in particular, &amp; ſo live as without God in the World. Beware of thoſe growing Sins of the Times, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Swearing and taking the Name of God in vain, Sabbath-breaking, deſpiſing the Goſpel of Chriſt, neglecting the Publick Worſhip of God, mocking at the Meſſengers of the Lord, deriding ſerious Devotion and a tender Conſcience, and turning Sacramental Myſteries into Banter. <hi>O be ye not Mockers, leſt your Bands be made ſtrong;</hi> leſt you provoke a holy God to lead you forth with the Workers of Iniquity, and hang you up in Chains, as Monuments of his juſt Severity. Take heed leſt any of you be profane Perſons, as <hi>Eſau,</hi> and miſs the Bleſſing. Beware leſt a terrible and jealous God come forth in Indignation to plead the Cauſe of his deſpiſed Name, and ſmite you, as he did profane <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> by Fire from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; leſt he tear you in pieces by wild Beaſts, as he did the Children that mocked <hi>Eliſha;</hi> or leſt he drown you in perdition, as he did the Scoffers of the old World; <hi>making them an Enſample unto

all that after ſhou'd live ungodly.</hi>—Do you not often hear Malefactors, under Sentence of Death, confeſſing &amp; bewailing their <hi>Profaneneſs,</hi> as what led the way to all their fatal Wickedneſs? And will you not take Warning from their Example, to deny all Ungodlineſs, leſt it be your Ruine in the end for both Worlds! <hi>Beware leſt that come upon you, which is ſpoken of in the Prophets, Behold, ye Deſpiſers, and wonder, and periſh.</hi> Hear this, O ye that ſay, When will the Sabbath be over, that we may ſell Corn, may return to Buſineſs or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion? that ſay, What a Wearineſs is it? that ſnuff at God's Altar, and call his Table contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible: <hi>Behold, He will cut off the man that doth this.</hi> The Lord hath ſworn by the Excellency of <hi>Jacob,</hi> Surely I will not forget any of their Works.

His Wrath is revealed from Heaven, as againſt all Ungodlineſs, ſo againſt all <hi>Unrighteouſneſs</hi> of Men. What will it profit you, to have a Form of Godlineſs, if you deny the Power of it, by living in Vice? Thus ſaith the Lord, Truſt ye not in lying Words, crying, The Temple of the Lord! Will ye ſteal, &amp; murder, &amp; commit Adultery; and come &amp; ſtand before me, and ſay, We are deliver'd to do all theſe Abominations! Behold, ye truſt in lying Words, that cannot profit!

Take heed leſt a <hi>flattering Tongue work Ruin</hi> to your ſelves, as well as your Neighbour. <hi>The Kiſſes of an Enemy are deceitful,</hi> and provoking: and often have no other Return but Hatred &amp; Indignation.—The Lord has threaten'd <hi>to cut off all flattering Lips.</hi> He has ſaid, <hi>Whoſe Hatred is covered by Deceit, his Wickedneſs ſhall be ſhewed before the whole Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>—And how do you know, while you hide Hatred with lying Lips, &amp; let Anger reſt in your Boſom, but that before you are aware the ſmother'd Fire may break out, beyond Controul, in Fury and Miſchief, that ſhall prepare the way for your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy &amp; Ruin!</p>

Or, again, are you tempted to tell Lies for <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit;</hi> in matters of Trade ſpeaking falſely, to get Gain by cheating others? O take heed that you deal not Treacherouſly, leſt the Sin of your Mouth bring you into undoing Snares. Remember that Word; <hi>The getting of Treaſures by a lying Tongue is a Vanity toſſed to &amp; fro of them that ſeek Death: the Robbery of the Wicked ſhall deſtroy them:</hi> They that make no Conſcience of telling a Lie, when there's anything to be got by it, do expoſe themſelves to the Envy &amp; ill Will of Men, and to the Wrath and Curſe of God. You had as good pick a Man's Pocket, as cheat him by a Lie: And as this leads to that, take heed leſt you be puniſh'd for one by being left to the other, and ſo proceed from Evil to Evil, till you be undone, as to Name, Eſtate, and Life, and deſtroy your Soul for ever.</p>
            <p>In a word, Are you tempted to Lying, from a <hi>Fear of Puniſhment;</hi> inventing Falſehoods to hide ſome Fault you have been guilty of? Remember, this is but to make two faults of one, and will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you to double Puniſhment upon the Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. And then conſider, this is an unhappy Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to harden you in your Sin, &amp; tends to draw you into a Snare by tempting you to other Sins. If once the Spirit of Lying takes poſſeſſion of you, and eſpecially if you find it a ſucceſsful Means, in repeated Inſtances, to conceal your Faults, &amp; ſcreen you from Puniſhment; it will prepare you and tempt you to other Sins, which there's any Hope of covering by a Lie. A Habit of Lying has a fatal Tendency to blind and ſtupify Conſcience: It drives away the holy Spirit: it gratifies the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, the Father of Lies, &amp; emboldens him to tempt you to the worſt of Crimes, until you fill up the

            <p>Let the Fear of God reſtrain you from this Sin: for he has ſaid, <hi>The mouth of Liars ſhall be ſtopped;</hi> and that <hi>all Liars have their part in the Lake, which burns with fire and brimſtone.</hi> Will you not then put away Lying!

            <p n="9">9. Beware of <hi>Idleneſs,</hi> and <hi>evil Fellowſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Sins and Snares are ſeldom ſeparate, and therefore I put 'em together. The one leads to the other, and they both have a pernicious Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to draw unwary Youths into a thouſand other Snares and Sins.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Idleneſs,</hi> behold this was the Iniquity of thy Siſter <hi>Sodom:</hi> Abundance of Idleneſs was in her, &amp; in her Sons &amp; Daughters. It is very much a <hi>City</hi>-Sin, and a Sin of <hi>Youth.</hi> The Apoſtle remarks it of young Perſons, <hi>They learn to be idle,</hi> wandring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout from houſe to houſe, and not only idle, but <hi>Tatlers alſo, and Buſy-bodies, ſpeaking Things which they ought not.</hi>—Idleneſs is a common Inlet to many other Sins: it's ſeldom that thoſe who are idle, are <hi>only</hi> idle: they are at Leaſure to attend the <hi>Devil'</hi>s Motions, and often go of his Errands.</p>
            <p>Let our young People, whoſe glory is their ſtrength, be <hi>aſham'd</hi> to eat the Bread of Idleneſs. Some ſeem to fancy it a piece of <hi>Gentility,</hi> the Sign of a polite Education, to be always at Leaſure &amp; above Buſineſs; and therefore <hi>affect</hi> an idle Life: But I wou'd mind them of that Paſſage in the heathen Poet, quoted by the Apoſtle, <hi>The Cretians are evil Beaſts, ſlew Bellies:</hi> and of that of <hi>Solomon, Go to the Ant, thou Sluggard; conſider her ways, and be wiſe:</hi> learn of her to redeem your Time.</p>
            <p>And be <hi>afraid,</hi> leſt by indulging a Humour for Idleneſs, which ſo leads to Wantonneſs and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery, you fall into Reproach, &amp; the <hi>Snare of

O fear, leſt with the ſlothful and unprofitable Servant, you be doom'd at laſt to be bound hand and foot, &amp; caſt into the Dungeon of Hell.</p>
            <p>Beware alſo of <hi>bad Company-keeping.</hi> Take Care how you contract unneceſſary friendſhip and intimacy or partnerſhip with vain Perſons, leſt you get a Snare to your Soul, &amp; learn their Ways; be inticed into Sin, and harden'd in Vice, by evil Counſels &amp; ill Examples: which have a peculiar force upon the giddy tho'tleſs Age of Childhood and Youth. He that walketh with the Wiſe, ſhall be wiſe: but <hi>a Companion of Fools ſhall be deſtroy'd;</hi> his religious Principles ſhock'd, his Virtue ruin'd, his Honour loſt, &amp; his Eſtate conſum'd, his Life perhaps cut ſhort, &amp; which is worſe, his Soul undone for ever. For how naturally does evil &amp; fooliſh Company lead to and cheriſh the Vices of Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs &amp; Extravagance, of Gaming, and Drinking, and Whoring? And how inevitably do theſe things work Death and Miſery, to Body &amp; Soul! Will you not then, my Children, <hi>forſake the Fooliſh, and live.</hi> Depart, I pray you, from the Tents of theſe wicked Men, <hi>leſt ye be conſumed in all their Sins.</hi> O ſave your ſelves from this untoward, this adulterous &amp; voluptuous Generation.</p>
            <p>Enter not into the path of the Wicked: avoid it, paſs not by it, turn from it, &amp; paſs away. Let our young Women remember what came of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy <hi>Dinah'</hi>s Gadding, when <hi>ſhe went out to ſee the Daughters of the Land,</hi> to get Acquaintance with

the <hi>Canaanites;</hi> and take Warning, that Diverſion and Company do not betray you into the Snares of Luſt and Folly. The Apoſtle wou'd have the young women taught to be <hi>ſober, diſcreet, Chaſt, Keepers at home, that the word of God be not blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</hi>—And let our young Men be admoniſh'd and take Warning from the tremendous Example of <hi>Ahaziah</hi> (the Son of <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi>) who was ruin'd by ungodly Company. It's ſaid of him, <hi>He did Evil in the ſight of the Lord, like the houſe of</hi> Ahab;<hi>for they were his Counſellers, after the death of his Father, unto his Deſtruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dear Children, if you would not have your <hi>Souls gather'd with Sinners</hi> in another World, abhor and fly their Company in this. <hi>Come out from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, ſaith the Lord, &amp; be ye ſeparate, i. e.</hi> in reſpect of Affection, Imitation, &amp; familiar Society: <hi>and I will receive you, and ye ſhall be my Sons and Daughters, ſaith the Lord Almighty.</hi>

in a formal Round of religious Duties; in a Spirit of Bigottry for certain Superſtitions, or an empty noiſy Zeal for Divine Inſtitutions: as if ſuch things intitled you to the favour of God, and would engage the Protection &amp; Smiles of Heaven upon you.—Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of imbibing looſe Principles in Religion, or taking up light Thoughts of Sin: beware of indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging a vain Dependence on pious Parentage and Covenant-Privileges; or a proud Conceit of your own Sufficiency, and Self-Righteouſneſs; or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervaluing Tho'ts of ſpiritual Bleſſings, &amp; an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate Opinion of this preſent World; or the fond Dream of a long Life on Earth:—Which things are often the fatal Impediments to Sinners Converſion, the Means of their hardning now, and periſhing hereafter.

            <p>Beware of indulging yourſelves in ſeemingly <hi>little</hi> Follies. No Sin indeed is abſolutely little: but it's one Wile of the Devil to tempt unto ſome Sins by a pretence of their being ſmall ones; and hereby he deceives many Souls into Ruin. But conſider, the leaſt Sin indulged tends to harden the Heart, is malignant in its Nature, and is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking to God; who often in righteous Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure gives Men up, when they will not be reform'd, to commit greater Sins, heinous Crimes, with the ſame Security.

I wou'd now (as doubtleſs it is expected from the I ſhou'd) apply the Exhortation more particularly to the unhappy <hi>Condemned Woman,</hi> at this time in the Preſence of God with us, and in a few days to be cut off from among the Living.</p>
            <p>Hearken, O Woman, to the Word of the Lord, and let it ſink down into your Ears. Hear, and your Soul ſhall live. O ſeek the Lord, while he may be found: call upon him, while he is near.

Work of Converſion, nothing ſhort of the Waſhing of Regeneration, will ſtand you in any ſtead, when you come to die, &amp; appear before the Judgment Seat of Chriſt. Think ſolemnly of thoſe Words of Chriſt, your Judge (I commend them particularly to your Conſideration) and look upon 'em as ſpoken to you, Joh. 13 8 <hi>If I waſh thee not, thou haſt no Part with me.</hi> O Realiſe the Neceſſity of your being <hi>waſhed</hi> (that is, ſanctify'd and juſtify'd) <hi>by Chriſt:</hi> and go to Chriſt by unceaſing Prayer, begging that He would beſtow this ſpiritual Waſhing upon you; that He would waſh you from your Sins with his own Blood; that he would by his holy Spirit cleanſe you from all your Filthineſs, and purge your Conſcience from dead Works, to ſerve the living God, the few days you have to tarry in this World, and to make you meet for the Inheritance of the Saints in Light. <hi>Believeſt thou that he is able to do this great thing for thee?</hi> O hear him calling to you, as in Hoſ. 13. 9. <hi>Thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelf, but in me is thy Help.</hi> Hear him inviting you, as in Iſa. 45 22. <hi>Look unto Me, and be ſaved.</hi> O then be thou <hi>looking unto JESUS,</hi> a once crucify'd, and now glorify'd Jeſus. <hi>Look to him, whom you've pierced</hi> by your Sins, <hi>and mourn as</hi> a Woman <hi>for the</hi> Loſs of <hi>her firſt born.</hi> Look unto him, as the Lord your Righteouſneſs and your Strength: and fly for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge to him: <hi>Bleſſed are all they, that</hi> with Faith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned <hi>put their Truſt in Him</hi> See that you truſt not in your Tears &amp; Sorrows, Confeſſions and Reſolutions; they can't atone for Sin, nor cleanſe the Soul 'Tis only the Blood of Chriſt, and the Spirit of Chriſt, that can do this.

Yet this you can't do as of yourſelf: You muſt be begotten to it by the Spirit of Chriſt. O beg, and ceaſe not begging at the Throne of Grace, for an Experience of the New Birth.—And know it, if you are born of the Spirit,

you ſhall certainly ſee the Kingdom of Heaven: if Chriſt waſh you here, you ſhall partake with him in Glory for ever.—I ſhall only add, tho' you may be well aſham'd to meet Death in thoſe inglorious Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, in which you are to die; yet remember, that juſt one the Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, was hanged on a Tree, died an accurſed Death, not indeed for his own Sins, but for the Sins of his People: and ſo has ſanctify'd all manner of Deaths, even the moſt ignominious, to them which believe on his Name. O be looking to Jeſus, by an Eye of Faith: and ſo doing, you may <hi>lift up your Head,</hi> at the Approach of Death in its moſt hideous Shape and infamous Circumſtances, with a humble hope of finding Mercy with him, thro' whoſe Mercy <hi>Rahab</hi> the Harlot periſh'd not, and thro' whoſe Mercy <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> had her many Sins forgiven her.—O give Glory to the Lord, before you die, by making Confeſſion to God, and giving Warnings to Men.

            <head>The Declaration, DYING Warnings and Advice OF Rebekah Chamblit, A Young Woman aged near Twenty-ſeven Years, Executed at Boſton, September 27th. 1733.</head>
            <p>BEING under the awful Apprehenſions of my Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on now in a few Hours; and being deſirous to do all the Good I can, before I enter the Eternal World, I now in the fear of GOD, give this Declaration and Warning to the Living.</p>
            <p>I Was very tenderly brought up, and well Inſtructed in my Father's Houſe, till I was Twelve Years of Age; but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſs, my Childhood wore off in vanity. However, as I grew in Years, my Youth was under very ſenſible Impreſſions from the SPIRIT of GOD; and I was awakened to ſeek and obtain Baptiſm, when I was about Sixteen Years of Age; and lived for ſome time with a ſtrictneſs ſomewhat anſwerable to the Obligations I was thereby brought under. But within two or three Years after this, I was led away into the Sin of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, from which time I think I may date my Ruin for this World. After this, I became again more watchful, and for ſeveral Years kept my ſelf from the like Pollutions, until thoſe for which I am now to ſuffer.</p>
            <p>And as it may be neceſſary, ſo doubtleſs it will be expected of me, that I give the World a particular account of that great Sin, with the aggravations of it, which has brought me to this Shameful Death: And accordingly in the fear of GOD, at whoſe awful Tribunal I am immediately to appear, I ſolemnly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare as follows;</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:003655_0076_10023E32E3531F10"/>
That on Saturday the Fifth Day of <hi>May</hi> laſt, being then ſomething more than Eight Months gone with Child, as I was about my Houſhold Buſineſs reaching ſome Sand from out of a large Cask, I received conſiderable hurt, which put me into great Pain, and ſo I continued till the Tueſday following; in all which time I am not ſenſible I felt any Life or Motion in the Child within me; when, on the ſaid Tueſday the Eighth Day of <hi>May,</hi> I was Deliver'd when alone of a Male Infant; in whom I did not perceive Life; but ſtill uncertain of Life in it, I threw it into the Vault about two or three Minutes after it was born; <hi>uncertain</hi> I ſay, whether it was a living or dead Child; tho', I confeſs its probable there was Life in it, and ſome Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances ſeem to confirm it. I therefore own the Juſtice of GOD and Man in my Condemnation, and take Shame to my ſelf, as I have none but my ſelf to Blame; and am ſorry for any raſh Expreſſions I have at any time uttered ſince my Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and I am verily perſwaded there is no Place in the World, where there is a more ſtrict regard to Juſtice than in this Province.</p>
            <p>And now as a Soul going into Eternity, I moſt earneſtly and ſolemnly Warn all Perſons, particularly YOUNG PEOPLE, and more eſpecially thoſe of my own Sex, againſt the Sins which their Age peculiarly expoſes them to; and as the Sin of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs has brought me into theſe diſtreſſing Circumſtances, I would with the greateſt Importunity Caution and Warn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, being perſwaded of the abounding of that Sin in this Town and Land. I thought my ſelf as ſecure, a little more than a Year ago, as many of you now do; but by woful Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience I have found, that Luſt when it has conceived bringeth forth Sin, and Sin when it is finiſhed bringeth forth Death; it expoſes the Soul not only to Temporal, but to Eternal Death. And therefore as a Dying Perſon, let me call upon you to forſake the fooliſh and live: Do not accompany with thoſe you know to be ſuch, and if Sinners entice you do not conſent. I am ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible there are many Houſes in this Town, that may be called Houſes of Uncleanneſs, and Places of dreadful Temptations to this and all other Sins. O ſhun them, for they lead down to the Chambers of Death and Eternal Miſery.</p>
            <p>My miſpending of precious Sabbaths, lies as a heavy burden upon me; that when I might have gone to the Houſe of GOD, I have been <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>different, and ſuffer'd a ſmall matter to keep me from it. What would I wow give, had I better improv'd the Lord's Day. I tell you, verily, your loſt Sabbaths will ſit hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
<pb facs="unknown:003655_0077_10023E2A6CD80AA0"/>
upon you, when you come into the near proſpect of Death and Eternity.</p>
            <p>The Sin of Lying I have to bewail, and wou'd earneſtly cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt; not that I have took ſo great a pleaſure in Lying; but I have often done ſo to conceal my Sin: Certainly you had better ſuffer Shame and Diſgrace, yea the greateſt Puniſhment, than to hide and conceal your Sin, by Lying. How much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had it been for me, to have confeſs'd my Sin, than by hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it to provoke a holy GOD, thus to ſuffer it to find me out! But I hope I heartily deſire to bleſs GOD, that even in this way, He is thus entring into Judgment with me; for I have often thought, had I been let alone to go on undiſcovered in my Sins, I might have provok'd Him to leave me to a courſe of Rebellion, that would have ripen'd me for a more ſudden and everlaſting Deſtruction; and am fully convinc'd of this, that I ſhould have had no ſolid eaſe or quiet in my mind, but the Guilt of this undiſcover'd Sin lying upon my Conſcience, would have been a tormenting Rack unto me all my Days; whereas now I hope GOD has diſcover'd to me in ſome meaſure the evil of this, and all my other Sins, and enabled me to repent of them in Duſt and Aſhes; and made me earneſtly deſire and plead with Him for pardon and cleanſing in the precious Blood of the REDEEMER of loſt and periſhing Sinners: And I think I can ſay, I have had more comfort and ſatisfaction within the Walls of this Priſon, than ever I had in the ways of Sin among my vain Companions, and think I wou'd not for a World, nay for ten Thouſand Worlds have my liberty in Sin again, and be in the ſame Condition I was in before I came into this Place.</p>
            <p>I had the advantage of living in ſeveral religious Families: but alaſs, I diſregarded the Inſtructions and Warnings I there had, which is now a bitterneſs to me; and ſo it will be to thoſe of you who are thus favoured, but go on unmindful of GOD, and deaf to all the Reproofs and Admonitions that are given you for the good of your Souls. And I would adviſe thoſe of my own Sex eſpecially, to chuſe to go into religious Families, where the Worſhip and Fear of GOD is maintained, and ſubmit your ſelves to the Orders and Government of them.</p>
            <p>In my younger Years I maintain'd a conſtant courſe of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Prayer for ſome time; but afterwards neglecting the ſame, I found by experience, that upon my thus leaving GOD, He was provoked to forſake me, and at length ſuffer'd me to fall into that great and complicated Sin that has <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

Death: Mind me, I firſt left GOD, and then he left me: I therefore ſolemnly call upon YOUNG PEOPLE to cheriſh the Convictions of GOD's Holy SPIRIT, and be ſure keep up a conſtant courſe of fervent Secret Prayer.</p>
            <p>And now I am juſt entring into the Eternal World, I do in the fear of GOD, and before Witneſſes, call upon our YOUNG PEOPLE in particular, to ſecure an Intereſt in the Lord JESUS CHRIST, and in thoſe precious Benefits He has purchaſed for His People; for ſurely the favour of GOD, thro' CHRIST, is more worth than a whole World: And O what Comfort will this yield you when you come to that awful Day and Hour I am now arriving unto. I muſt tell you, the World appears to me vain and empty, nothing like what it did in my paſt Life, my Days of Sin and Vanity, and as doubtleſs it appears now to you. Will you be perſwaded by me to that which will yield you the beſt Satisfaction and Pleaſure here, and which will prepare you for the more abundant Pleaſures of GOD's Right Hand for evermore?</p>
