            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF GREAT-BRITAIN AND AMERICA.</head>
            <p>THE affairs of Great-Britain and her Colonies are at a criſis. If our juſtice or our moderation dictate to us the making any conceſſions, they ſhould be made whilſt they can yet be <hi>imputed</hi> to our moderation or our juſtice. The preſent Seſſion of Parliament ſhould determine upon ſome permanent ſyſtem in this point. Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſhould fix the Pretenſions which ſhe will never relinquiſh, and the Colonies ſhould have certain information of thoſe claims which they muſt ſubmit to. Until ſuch a ſyſtem be reſolved upon, there will be irreſolution on the one ſide, and repugnance on the other; and no ſyſtem can be ſtable that is not founded upon equity and wiſdom.</p>
            <p>IT is the reſolution of the preſent Miniſtry, it is ſaid, to impoſe taxes upon the Colonies, by the authority of the Britiſh Parliament, and to <hi>compel</hi> the Colonies to ſubmiſſion. To examine the juſtice and the policy of thoſe meaſures, and to ſuggeſt others, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to me leſs exceptionable, in each of thoſe particulars, is my object.</p>
            <p>THE Colonies, by their reſpective Charters, have not uniform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſame privileges, or the ſame conſtitution. But though they differ in many particulars, they are alike in the following; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That the inhabitants of every one of them have a right to tax themſelves by their representatives, in their provincial aſſemblies;
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:011193_0003_0F85CD754CB5E030"/>that none of them vote for repreſentatives in the Britiſh Parliament; and that all of them are to enjoy the freedom of Britiſh ſubjects. In the ſearch for arguments againſt the Americans, the validity of thoſe charters has not paſſed unqueſtioned. I ſhall ſay, however, but a little in their ſupport, as the attacks have been very weak and very few. From the earlieſt times down to the preſent, the diſpoſition of foreign territory belonging to Great-Britain has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been veſted in the Executive. It is a power which the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration and the Revolution have left unſhaken. From the ceſſion of Tangier to that of Guadaloupe, how frequently has it been exerciſed? And in the particular inſtance of Gibraltar, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to paſs a law to reſtrain it.
<note n="*" place="bottom">At preſent it is unalienable from Great-Britain.</note> If then the Crown, at the time when it granted the charters, could have ceded the territory of America to a foreign power, could it not have fixed the terms on which its preſent and future inhabitants ſhould continue the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Great Britain? Where it could have relinquiſhed <hi>all</hi> the authority poſſeſſed by Great-Britain, certainly it could relinquiſh a <hi>part</hi> of that authority. Where it could make a <hi>total alienation</hi> to enemies even, ſurely it could make a <hi>modified grant</hi> to ſubjects. But ſuppoſe that the Crown had not been legally poſſeſſed of that power, is there not a term after which uninterrupted poſſeſſion confers a right? Have not the Coloniſts poſſeſſed their charters much longer than that term? Have they not dedicated their lives and fortunes to the improvement of that country, from a depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon the validity of their title? Have not the Britiſh Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeen and acquieſced in their doing ſo? Has not Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, in her excluſive trade, received a valuable conſideration? Surely then it would be monſtrous injuſtice to deprive them of rights ſo purchaſed and ſo confirmed. It has alſo been urged by ſome, that the Parliament can <hi>revoke</hi> theſe charters when it ſhall think proper; for that it can take away from any city or corporate town, in England, its charter, notwithſtanding any length of time it may have enjoined it. I anſwer, that if an Engliſh city or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate town had ſo purchaſed their charter, as the Coloniſts have purchaſed theirs, and had ſo long poſſeſſed it, it would be unjuſt in the Parliament to reſcind or violate it. But the compariſon is totally unfair; for the charter of an Engliſh city or corporate town, and thoſe of the Colonies, beſides other material differences, have this eſſential one, that the former give a Right of repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Britiſh Parliament and that the latter do not. If therefore the charter of a Britiſh city or borough be reſcinded by Parliament, it is reſcinded in an aſſembly which is the repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative of that city or borough. Where a part of England only is concerned, the legiſlature of England may claim unlimited power, as a body to which all the rights of Engliſhmen are made over and entruſted. But the charters of America are agreements made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween England on the one part, and the Colonies on the other.
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:011193_0004_0F85CD7656B64908"/>The Houſe of Commons of England is the repreſentative of one of the contracting parties only, namely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               </gap>; and therefore cannot act for both. They have none of them any ſhare in elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; it cannot therefore legiſlate for them. It is a party, and cannot therefore be a judge.</p>
            <p>THE opponents of the Americans admit, that they are intitled to the privilege, of Britiſh ſubjects; that they are a free people. Could we determine what theſe privileges are, and what this free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the diſpute would be at an end. The American aſſerts, that he is deprived of the moſt eſſential privilege of a Briton, and a free man, if the colony to which he belongs can be taxed by an aſſembly in which it is not repreſented. The advocate for admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, anſwers, that there are many natives of Great-Britain herſelf who are not repreſented; for that there are many who have not votes in the choice of repreſentatives, and that the Coloniſts have no cauſe to complain, when they are in the ſame condition as <hi>many</hi> of the natives of Great-Britain. Would a Colony pretend to a better conſtitution than the mother country, from whence ſhe derives it? As this argument has been frequently repeated, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it to be a favourite one with adminiſtration; and as it is the only method that has been tried to reconcile their aſſertion, that "the Britiſh Parliament has a right to tax the Colonies," with their conceſſions, that the Colonies have the privileges of Britons, and are a free people; let us liſten to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, ſo are there many Coloniſts who have no vote in the election of our <hi>provincial</hi> repreſentatives; alledge, if you will, that in being taxed by your Parliament, you are taxed by an <hi>imperfect</hi> repreſentative; in being taxed by our <hi>provincial</hi> aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, we are taxed by a repreſentative <hi>as</hi> imperfect. Our free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom therefore, in point of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

But if we are to be taxed by your Parliament, our conſtitution no longer reſembles yours, and our freedom is annihilated. If there be many Britons who have <hi>not</hi> a vote in the choice of their repreſentatives, there are alſo many that <hi>have.</hi> The poſſeſſion of a 40<abbr>s.</abbr> freehold, in Britain, confers the privilege of a vote: the poſſeſſion of the whole continent of America, does not confer that privilege.

                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  </hi> have that power? The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

and therefore you are a free people; the former is what we claim; the latter is the condition of ſlaves, and that is what you offer. We claim the right of ſuffrage, as the privileges of Britons, and you tell us we have it, becauſe we are like thoſe Britons who have it <hi>not!</hi> We claim the ſame conſtitution as Great-Britain, and you offer us only the <hi>defect</hi> of that conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but deny us its <hi>advantages.</hi> England cannot be taxed but by an aſſembly, where her land is repreſented by Knights, her monied intereſt by Citizens and Burgeſſes, and therefore ſhe is a free nation. Is then America on a par with England, in point of Freedom? If ſhe can be taxed by an Aſſembly, to which her freeholders ſend <hi>no</hi> Knights, and her cities <hi>no</hi> Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens. You ſay that your right of ſuffrage is partially diſtributed, in Britain; give us then a right of ſuffrage <hi>as</hi> partially diſtribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in America. For this repreſentation, partial and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as you call it, your Magna Chartas have been demanded, your patriots have bled, and your monarchs have been dethron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Was this for nothing? yet this you deny to the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, though you ſay to us, Ye have the privileges of Britons.</q>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>BUT there is yet another defect in your argument. For it is not true that we are in <hi>as good</hi> a condition as thoſe Britons whom you call unrepreſented, and who are not electors: for even <hi>they</hi> have this great advantage, that both the repreſentative and the electors pay a part of the tax, as well as thoſe who have no ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage: whereas if the Houſe of Commons of England ſhould tax the Americans, neither the repreſentatives nor the electors would pay any proportion of what they impoſed upon us; they would not tax, but <hi>untax</hi> themſelves. The condition therefore of an Engliſhman who has no ſuffrage, when taxed by the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh legiſlature, and of an American taxed by the ſame autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, are totally diſſimilar. Place them in ſituations which bear <hi>any</hi> ſimilitude, and it will ſhew in the ſtrongeſt light, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice of the preſent meaſures. Suppoſe then that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Britain ſhould impoſe a tax, from which themſelves and thoſe who voted for them ſhould be exempted, and which ſhould be paid entirely by thoſe who had no ſuffrages; this would bear <hi>ſome</hi> reſemblance to their taxing the Americans; and would not this be unparalleled injuſtice? But if even this (unjuſt as you muſt eſteem it) were the practice of your Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the condition of a non-voting Engliſhman would ſtill be infinitely preferable to ours; for even ſuch a tax as I have ſtated, would fall upon the relations, the friends, the depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

If therefore the legiſlature of Britain ſhould adopt ſuch a ſyſtem of unparalleled injuſtice, with reſpect to the non-voting inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of Britain, yet, even the ſufferers by, and the objects of that injuſtice, would be happy, in compariſon of us. Suppoſe, for a moment, if you can bear the thought, ſuppoſe for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that your Houſe of Commons were not elected by you, that they were an hereditary body, in no wiſe indebted to your choice; would you not be an enſlaved and an unhappy people: but even then you would be happier than we are. A body of 500 men, ſituated in the midſt of ſeven millions, and taxing thoſe ſeven millions, would ſurely be more bound to modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by fear, if not by principle, than the ſame body, aſſiſted and ſupported by thoſe ſeven millions, in taxing two millions who are at a diſtance. To oppreſs, in one inſtance, would at leaſt be infamy, if it would not be puniſhment; in the other they might find it popularity, they might think it patriotiſm. Mr. P—tt ſaid, (if I miſtake not) that every man in England could huzza at an election: even that method of expreſſing one's wiſhes, is ſome ſatisfaction, and has ſome influence; the ſhoutings of the people have had great effects; and the very murmurs of Engliſhmen, had perhaps more ſhare in the repeal of the ſtamp-act, than the united voice of America. We cannot even <hi>huzza</hi> at a Britiſh election!</p>
               <p>THE right of preſenting petitions to parliament was deemed of ſo much importance, that it was inſerted in the Bill of Rights. In this fundamental right, the bulwark againſt parliamentary op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, as well as every other, under what diſadvantages ſhould we labour, if you were to make laws for us? How different is the effect of a petition preſented by the hands of the injured, enforced by their aſſiduity, and recommended by their tears, from that of our paper-repreſentations? They are ſubject to be miſrepreſented in a thouſand ways.</p>
               <p>THEY come cold, and you do not feel them; often too late, and you cannot comply with them, and what was done by you through inattention and miſtake, muſt be maintained <hi>for dignity;</hi> in a word, they do not ſtrike home, either upon your caution or your kindneſs, your affections or your fears. In this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, the very women and children of England, have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon parliament, of which the Americans are deſtitute. How different is your lot from ours! In the character of an American, to the people of England I ſpeak. Your frequent elections are a valuable privilege to you; what privilege are they to us? At the cloſe of a parliament, you expect popular meaſures, from the ſears and the hopes of your repreſentatives.
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:011193_0007_0F85CD77F0335718"/>But who will find it his intereſt to be a friend to America? They will wiſh to gain the favour of their countrymen, and therefore will burthen America, in order to diſburthen England. What to you is a valuable privilege, will be to us a ſource of repeated oppreſſion. We are worſe even than your Papiſts. In being excluded from the right of ſuffrage, they are like us; and as they pay double land-tax, in that <hi>additional</hi> payment the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance continues; for it is a tax impoſed by men whom they had no ſhare in electing, and it is a tax which thoſe who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it do not pay. But this diſability in point of ſuffrage, and this <hi>additional</hi> payment, are penalties inflicted on your Papiſts; and why? Allegiance as by law required is a quality eſſential to being a ſubject. Your Papiſts are defective in that quality. They are conſidered as not completely ſubjects, and, as ſuch, penalties are inflicted on them. Your only juſtification for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting theſe penalties on them, is that you doubt their being ſubjects. Your only pretence for inflicting the ſame penalties on us, is that we are ſubjects. <hi>Same</hi> penalties, did I ſay, nay worſe; for as they are inflicted on us, without offence, we cannot by a diſcontinuation of offence, exempt ourſelves from theſe grievances. The Papiſt, by becoming a Proteſtant, can free himſelf from this diſability, and this double taxation: but we cannot free ourſelves from this miſery, but by ceaſing to be Americans. Beſides, in every other caſe, except that addition of land-tax, your Papiſts are in as good a ſituation as any of the reſt of your inhabitants who have not votes: but in <hi>every</hi> tax you lay upon us, we are in as bad a ſituation as your Papiſts are in that one. Beſides, your Papiſts are connected with their legiſlators, by relationſhip, friendſhip, neighbourhood, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance. Their poſſeſſions too are Britiſh, and they muſt have influence, tho' they have not votes. And the great right of petitioning, they poſſeſs, with all its advantages, and can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force their petitions by their preſence, their aſſiduity, their numbers, and their tears. In how much worſe a ſituation are we than your Papiſts, whom for their obſtinacy in an unconſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutional and perſecuting religion, you have made the outcaſts of legiſlation. What then is the freedom, and what are thoſe Britith privileges, to which you confeſs we are entitled? What are thoſe rights which we have poſſeſſed above an hundred years, which we derived from ſolemn compact, which we have purchaſed by an unſhaken allegiance, and by the profits of our trade?</p>
            </q>
            <p>IN this reply, which I have put into the mouth of a Coloniſt, I have examined, pretty minutely, the real extent of American li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, under the preſent meaſures. I have ſhewn the <hi>diſſimilarity</hi> of their condition to our own, and to that of a free people. I ſhall now ſhew the ſimilarity of their condition to that of thoſe nations whom we call ſlaves. The author of the Letter to Lord Hillſbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:011193_0008_0F85CD78B6414458"/>ſays, "Libertas recipit magis et minus, that there are degrees of freedom." I allow it. In what does perfect political liberty conſiſt? Some authors define it to be, "the power of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what the laws permit." If I do not miſtake the meaning of this definition, it is clearly erroneous. To do what the laws of Turkey permit, certainly is <hi>not</hi> liberty. Perfect political liberty conſiſts rather, — in the not being ſubject to any laws, but ſuch as we have conſented to by ourſelves, or by our repreſentatives. If Britain is but imperfectly repreſented, it has but an imperfect free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. But conſidering the imperfection of every thing human, it may well boaſt of the excellence of its conſtitution. There are other nations, the lives and fortunes of whoſe inhabitants are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant upon the will of ſome perſon whom they do not elect, and whom they cannot remove; or upon ſome other country, in the government of which they have no ſhare, France, Spain, and Turkey are inſtances of the firſt; Corſica, while it was under the yoke of Genoa, of the ſecond. All ſuch governments are abſolute or deſpotic, and the people ſubject to them we call enſlaved. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their ſituation and our own, there are indeed many degrees. But I defy the author of the letter to Lord Hillſborough, to ſhew, that any of thoſe degrees would be enjoyed by the Americans, if meaſures ſhould be carried to the extremes which we now hear of. I do not ſay that there is <hi>not</hi> a medium, between a good conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſimple deſpotiſm; but I ſay the Americans would not <hi>poſſeſs</hi> that medium. He objects to the advocates for America, their aſſerting, "That if dependance be enforced in any the leaſt degree, the Coloniſts are ſlaves." Let him not object it to me; my aſſertion is that they are ſlaves, if the Britiſh Parliament aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes unlimitted power over them, <hi>in every particular whatſoever.</hi> If a people can be deprived of their lives and their property, by another perſon, or another nation, is it not evident that ſuch a people is not free? whether it be by a nation, or by a monarch, is not material. The maſters indeed are diſſerent, but the <hi>govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is equally deſpotic. The Helots of Sparta were as much ſlaves, as the ſubjects of the Grand Signior. Now I defy any perſon to mention one ſingle power, which the Spartan Republic aſſumed over the Helots, which England does not aſſume over her Colonies. I would not inſinuate that Great-Britain will not govern with greater humanity: but if her power be mildly adminiſtered, it will indeed be a <hi>milder</hi> deſpotiſm, but it will not therefore be <hi>the leſs</hi> a deſpotiſm. Should we thus addreſs ourſelves to a colony of France or Spain: You live under an abſolute government; transfer your allegiance to us, and you ſhall enjoy thoſe privileges which Great-Britain diffuſed through all her dominions. Might it not anſwer us in theſe words; "I am not burthened with taxes in near ſo great a proportion as your Colonitis, but I would conſent to pay more than I do, if I were to enjoy a greater degree of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. What then are thoſe privileges which you offer to me? We might ſay to them, One of the principal privileges ſhall be this,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:011193_0009_0F85CD7973828600"/>that you ſhall not be taxed, except by your own repreſentatives, or elſe by the parliament of Britain. Might they not then reply to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>? I find then that my repreſentatives are not to be a part of that Britiſh Parliament which is to tax me; were I ſubject to the abſolute dominion of an aſſembly elected by the provinces and cities in France, ſhould I be one whit more free, than in being ſubject to the abſolute dominion of its monarch? When you ſpoke to me of privileges, I imagined that you meant that right of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage, which is the boaſt of the Britiſh conſtitution. You give it to me indeed, in one place, but you will tax me in a place where you will not give it to me. When our own Sovereign has taxed his ſubjects as much as he thinks proper, he will ſcarcely refuſe them the privilege of taxing themſelves again, in any manner they pleaſe. If you can demonſtrate to me that our monarch aſſumes one ſingle power over us, which you do not aſſume over your co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, I will hearken to your propoſals, but if you cannot, your government is as arbitrary as that of France, we are leſs taxed, and as free as your Colonies.</p>
            <p>HAVING examined the real condition of the Coloniſts, under the preſent ſuppoſed meaſures, with as much attention as I am capable of, I can find in it no circumſtance, which ſhould prevent my aſſerting that they would be as deſtitute of freedom, as any nation ever was, or ever can be: now whatever thoſe rights and privileges may conſiſt in, which confeſſedly belong to the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, they certainly do <hi>not</hi> conſiſt in <hi>ſlavery,</hi> which is the want of every right, and the deprivation of every privilege.</p>
            <p>I HAVE ſhewn that the compariſon between the Americans and thoſe Britons who have no ſuffrages, is falſe; and that if it were true, it would not be argumentative. I have ſhewn what the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Americans does <hi>not</hi> conſiſt in, and I will now endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſhew what <hi>are</hi> thoſe privileges which for our own ſakes we muſt allow them. I cannot help obſerving in this place, that every one who has written againſt them, has confined his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to the proving which of the Britiſh privileges they ought <hi>not</hi> to poſſeſs; but not one of them has mentioned thoſe privileges which they <hi>ought</hi> to enjoy. It is a little ſuſpicious that thoſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors whoſe profeſt deſign is to convince and to conciliate the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniſts, have never once enumerated thoſe advantages which they are ſtill to enjoy under parliamentary government. Surely nothing would be ſo likely to pacify them, as a recital of the bleſſings which are ſtill to remain to them.</p>
            <p>BUT to return; in order that the Americans ſhould enjoy Britiſh freedom, it is not ſufficient that they ſhould adopt <hi>that part only</hi> of our conſtitution, which <hi>departs</hi> from the principles of Britiſh li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. They muſt poſſeſs that part which is excellent, as well as that part which is defective, or their liberty is not an image of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:011193_0010_0F85CD7A9D8B1470"/>ours. It is not therefore ſufficient that an American land-holder ſhould be on a par with a Briton who has no landed property, or with a Britiſh Papiſt. But that an American <hi>freeholder</hi> ſhould have the ſame power over his <hi>own</hi> property, as a <hi>Britiſh</hi> freeholder has over <hi>his own.</hi> If any man ſhall object to me, that I have placed the Coloniſts in a ſituation <hi>too</hi> equal to their mother-country; I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer him, that I have done ſo, only with reſpect to their <hi>own veſted and acquired</hi> property
<note n="*" place="bottom">The Americans muſt relinquiſh many rights of property; that is, many rights of <hi>acquiring</hi> property; for they muſt be ſubject to Britiſh navigation laws, and trade-regulations: but the right of <hi>granting</hi> property already acquired and verted, ſhould be ſacred. This ſhould be theirs ſafe and entire.</note>; and that Americans have as much right to the property of America, when once <hi>acquired and veſted,</hi> as <hi>Britons</hi> have to the property of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN order that taxation and repreſentation may not be united in America, the adverſaries of America deny that they were united in Britain. And attempts have been made to produce inſtances of their diſunion, taken from different periods of the Britiſh conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is not material to my cauſe, to examine whether thoſe attempts have ſucceeded. If America be entitled to Engliſh privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, the Engliſh conſtitution, ſhe is entitled to that conſtitution, as it ſtood at the <hi>time</hi> when the colonies were planted. She is not to have the conſtitution that exiſted in the time of William the Conqueror, or of the Saxon heptarchies, or of the Roman govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If England communicated to America her conſtitution and her privileges, we communicated them ſuch as ſhe herſelf at that time enjoyed. It was the conſtitution of England at that period, that every man poſſeſſed of 40 <hi>s.</hi> a year, by that free tenure which we call a freehold, ſhould have a vote in electing a member of that aſſembly which alone could tax his property; beſides certain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons inveſted with privileges in cities and boroughs. This was and is the bulwark of Engliſh liberty; without this we ſhould be ſlaves. This then is the conſtitution which is communicated to America: let not therefore <hi>her</hi> property be taxed, except in an aſſembly to which <hi>her</hi> freeholders and electors ſend a repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. In the Saxon conſtitution, the privilege of voting was dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed much more univerſally; it belonged to all who held by a free tenure; that is, to all the <hi>ſubjects</hi> of England; for thoſe who hold by other tenures were not ſubjects, but vilani, or ſlaves. So entire was the union at that time, between repreſentation and tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation: but to this conſtitution the Coloniſts have no pretenſion, as it was not the conſtitution of England at the time of their eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. By the 8th of Hen. VI. the right of voting was confined to ſuch freeholders as had 40 <hi>s.</hi> a year, and thus the more opulent freeholders were entruſted with the rights of all the reſt. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me that England by this change had <hi>two</hi> kinds of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives. The richer freeholders repreſented the <hi>others,</hi> and the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:011193_0011_0F85CD7B1A40CF58"/>Houſe of Commons repreſented <hi>them.</hi> Thus the opulent freehol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were <hi>repreſentatives of election</hi> conſtituted by their circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; and the knights were <hi>repreſentatives of legiſlation,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by ſuffrage. If there be any juſtice in this opinion, all the <hi>ſubjects</hi> of England were either actually or virtually repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But if there be not, and if it be admitted that England was and is <hi>partially</hi> repreſented—Give a repreſentation <hi>as</hi> partial to her Colonies. If Britain be imperfectly repeſented, ſhe has but an <hi>imperſect</hi> freedom; but if the Colonies have <hi>no</hi> repreſentation, they have no freedom at all. If Britain has <hi>not</hi> the <hi>beſt</hi> conſtitution, which human invention could have ſuggeſted; is it a reaſon that America ſhould have the <hi>worſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN the memorable conteſt with the II—e of P—rs about the right of originating taxes, the C—ns urged with great force their excluſive right to that privilege. They thought it unreaſonable, even that any part of the taxes ſhould be encreaſed or diminiſhed, or that the rates ſhould be examined by the P—rs, "whoſe proportion in all taxes, in compariſon to what the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty pay, is very inconſiderable." I believe the ſame aſſembly think theſe words to contain good ſenſe at this day; and it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly very reaſonable, that thoſe who give the moſt, ſhould have the greateſt ſhare in modelling the gift. Such were the max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims that were formerly adopted by that great aſſembly, and ſuch were the reaſonings on which their greateſt privilege is eſtabliſhed. Why then do they <hi>now</hi> think it reaſonable, that thoſe who pay not an <hi>inconſiderable,</hi> but <hi>no</hi> proportion, ſhould not only originate a tax, but paſs it into a law Compare the ſpirit of their former maxims, with that of their preſent. "It is unjuſt in you, my L—ds, to <hi>begin</hi> a taxation, of which you pay only a ſmall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion." Yet we will <hi>impoſe</hi> a tax upon America, of which we pay no proportion at all. "It is unjuſt that you, my L—ds, ſhould even <hi>originate</hi> a tax upon men, of whom you are but the leſſer number, though the reſt may afterwards refuſe it if they pleaſe." But is it juſt for us to enact a tax-law for the Coloniſts, which they ſhall <hi>not</hi> have a power to refuſe, although we are not any part of them? "The right of propoſing taxes belongs to us as repreſentatives of the people who pay them, and yet we will tax a people of whom we are <hi>not</hi> repreſentatives." Bills of ſupply are looked upon, not only as laws, but as free gifts; and, on account of this difference in their natures, they are ſubject to different forms. The lords cannot originate them, although they alſo are <hi>legiſlators.</hi> And it is not the royal <hi>aſſent,</hi> which is given, but the royal <hi>thanks.</hi> The 9th of Henry 7th, enacts, that the King ſhall <hi>thank</hi> both Lords and Commons; but if our Parliament ſhall tax the Coloniſts, to whom are the r—l thanks to be addreſſed?

                  </gap>
               </hi> Is he to thank the Engliſh, for money which they
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:011193_0012_0F85CD806BCC0940"/>do not pay, or the Americans, for a <hi>free gift,</hi> wreſted from them againſt their will? Which of theſe mockeries would be moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy the great ſcene on which they are to be acted?</p>
            <p>MUCH declamation has been uſed, on both ſides. The Engliſh ſpeak of the blood and treaſure they have expended. The Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans, that they have encountered an inhoſpitable climate for the purpoſes of Great Britain, and have dedicated their lives and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, to her ſervice. There is no weight in any of theſe decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations. Whatever was done by either of them, was done for their own advantage. If Britain has protected the property of America, it does not conſtitute her the owner of that property. She has, for her own ſake, protected in their turns, almoſt every country in Europe, but that does not make her the proprietor of thoſe countries, or give her a power of taxation over them. If America, in purſuing her own intereſt, has advantaged Britain, we owe her no obligation. Whilſt we each poſſeſs thoſe benefits for which we expended our treaſure, and for which they encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered that climate, we owe nothing to each other but reciprocal affection. To extend their commerce, our anceſtors encouraged the emigration of Britiſh ſubjects. Their induſtry abroad was thought more advantageous, than their reſidence in Britain. As an inducement to forego thoſe privileges which they poſſeſſed, or might acquire at home, it was agreed that they ſhould carry Engliſh privileges along with them. And as an inducement to become the carriers, and the labourers of England, they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with a deſart territory, uſeful only by the induſtry they ſhould beſtow upon it, and this was given to them, as their <hi>wages.</hi> Let not a compact, founded in our intereſt, puchaſed by their labour, and confirmed by time, ſuffer any violation. Let us be content with our commercial advantages, and thoſe ſuperiorities which they willingly ſubmit to. Let us make them labour for us; but let us not take from them their <hi>wages,</hi> alſo.</p>
            <p>HAVING conſidered the juſtice of the preſent meaſures; let us now examine their policy; and in this examination, let our ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of equity forget to operate. Let us forget that they have rights, or that we have humanity. Let us ſuppoſe ourſelves en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into an agreement, with a <hi>free</hi> and a <hi>conſiderable</hi> people, and ſettling the terms of an everlaſting union. Or if any one ſhould be of opinion, that neither of theſe circumſtances is applicable to the Colonies; let us ſuppoſe them in their numbers inconſiderable, unaccuſtomed to liberty, overawed by fear, or humiliated by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and ready to receive any conſtitution, we pleaſe to impoſe upon them. In ſuch a ſituation, what reflections ſhould our own intereſt ſuggeſt to us? Though this people be weak, at preſent, their ſtrength and their numbers may increaſe
<note n="†" place="bottom">It is whimſical that Mr. Canning mentions the probable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the Americans, as an argument for meatures, that muſt exaſperate them.</note>; though we our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:011193_0013_0F85CD81765FA5B0"/>are ſtrong, our ſtrength may decline; though their ſpirit is depreſſed, it may revive. They are placed at a great diſtance from us. We have formidable enemies Their affections there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, are of the utmoſt importance, and there is no method ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of ſecuring their affections, as the making it their <hi>intereſt</hi> to be our friends. We ourſelves have a free conſtitution: if we grant liberty to them, they will be ſteady to us, becauſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not change for the better; if we aſſume unlimited and abſolute au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, they will wiſh to change, becauſe they cannot change for the worſe. The tyranny of a deſpotic commonwealth is infinitely worſe than that of a deſpotic prince. But it is vain to endeavour to deceive them; though they never have taſted liberty, they will ſoon become acquainted with its nature. They will perceive the <hi>miſery</hi> of their ſituation, by the happineſs of <hi>ours.</hi> While their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons are filled with our ſoldiers, their harbours with our fleets, and their employments with officers of our appointment, and while they derive from us a degree of freedom, we ſhall be ſecure, both by our own power, and by their affections. They are weak, by their circumſtances, let us not make them ſtrong, by their deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair. The gradual increaſe of numbers and of opulence, may add to their force, but that force will ſleep, unleſs it be awakened by injury: and while we retain an abſolute power over their trade, that very increaſe will depend upon our regulations. Whilſt they are happy under our government, their ſtrength and their opulence will be ſtrength and opulence to us; but, if we oppreſs them, they will be our weakneſs, and our danger. The numbers of a people are not ſo formidable, as their union, their hatred, their fury. If there ever ſhould come a time when they ſhall be able to ſhake off our ſovereignty, it will paſs unheeded, by a grateful and happy people. But if our dominion be founded <hi>only</hi> in <hi>our</hi> ſtrength, it will ſubſiſt no longer than <hi>their</hi> weakneſs. It is therefore evident that we ſhall hold America, by a better ſecurity, if we do not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave it. But will it afford us as much preſent emolument? This ſurely is a conſideration, much inferior to the other; it may have more weight with a ſhort-lived and a ſhort-ſighted adminiſtration; but can never have ſo much with a thinking nation. Yet let even this be conſidered; we know that this nation has paid conſiderable taxes, without any compulſion; and we know that free nations can ſupport greater burdens, than nations equally opulent, that are enſlaved. No power, no management, has ever ſucceeded to tax the latter, as highly as the firſt; and the efforts of deſpotiſm have produced only depopulation or rebellion. Thus it is by no means certain, that even our preſent emoluments would be the leſs, if we extort nothing from them againſt their own conſent

<pb n="13" facs="unknown:011193_0014_0F85CD8269C661B8"/>be ſerviceable; amongſt the latter, it would be formidable to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Let us alſo conſider with how much greater eagerneſs our manufactures will be purchaſed, by a grateful, than by an exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated people. We are now at peace with the world; the moſt rigorous meaſures may ſucceed, for the preſent; but ſuch meaſures are not the moſt eligible in themſelves, when conducive neither to preſent advantage, nor future ſecurity. The greateſt man of his age has told us, that two millions of fellow ſubjects, deprived of their liberty, would be fit inſtruments to make ſlaves of the reſt. Surely there is juſtice in his obſervation; thoſe whom we reduce to <hi>ſlavery,</hi> cannot wiſh well to our <hi>freedom.</hi> Let us alſo conſider that without aſſuming that deſpotic authority, which is intolerable to human nature, we may yet retain a power amazingly extenſive. A power over the commerce of a nation, affects the merchant, the landholder, and the manufacturer. Though we cannot dive into their purſes, to wreſt from them what they have <hi>already</hi> acquired, we can prevent their <hi>future</hi> acquiſitions. Nay, we can do more; we can make what they poſſeſs already, leſs valuable by its ſtagnation. Though the power of <hi>granting,</hi> belongs ſolely to themſelves, they will yet have but little power to <hi>refuſe.</hi> Let this content us: that the ſea, the common benefit of mankind, may be denied them, that the labour of their hands, the ſtrength and the ingunuity which nature has beſtowed upon them, ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to our purpoſes; but, for our own ſakes, let us not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage that induſtry which is to benefit ourſelves: what we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to acquire, let that be their own.</p>
            <p>THUS, on every preſent, and every future conſideration, I ſhould think myſelf an enemy to Great-Britain, ſhould I propoſe to give worſe terms to a people unendeared by former connections, unacquainted with liberty, and deſtitute of any claim upon our juſtice, than thoſe which are demanded for <hi>our fellow ſubjects.</hi> But it muſt not therefore be forgotten, that they have long been our friends and brothers; and that another ſyſtem cannot be eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, without a violation of national faith, a departure from our juſtice, and, at one time perhaps, the ſhedding of their blood. We ſhould be well aſſured of the rectitude of our cauſe, we ſhould advance to the utmoſt limits of negotiation, before we draw the ſword, againſt our brothers. We ſhall prevail, with certainty, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but we may not prevail, without a conteſt. And though the force of terror only, may give temporary eſtabliſhment to our authority, the ſword and the executioner only, muſt maintain it. From men deprived of every thing that they hold moſt dear, and deprived of it by their friends, what may not be expected? Any thing ſhould be expected, except their ſubmiſſion. What then are the ultimate objects of the moſt oppreſſive laws, and moſt ſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary councils? Will they reſtore us to that brotherly affection, which infuſed the ſame ſoul into every part of our empire, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure us an certain quiet, a diſaffected ſubmiſſion? Let France ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:011193_0015_0F85CD827A762BD8"/>
               <hi>ſuch</hi> a ſubmiſſion, from Corſica; by our ſupineneſs ſhe will obtain it, and ſhe may well be contented with it. She is accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to govern by fear; and over a people where heretofore ſhe had not authority, even that in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>uence will become acquiſition. But neither her numerous armies, nor her mighty power, nor her vicinity to that devoted iſland, nor the paucity of its inhabitants, can inſure to her a quiet and an uſeful poſſeſſion, while ſhe finds an enemy in the hearts of the people. But by us, if poſſible, ſtill leſs is to be expected: with leſs diſproportioned force, we may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter a more rooted antipathy. The Corſicans never taſted freedom, under a French adminiſtration; ſhe has only <hi>prevented</hi> their emancipation from the tyranny of Genoa, and will receive them under a milder oppreſſion. But the Americans will be <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived</hi> of a liberty which they have already poſſeſſed many years, under the tutelage of Great-Britain. A more violent change, a more intolerable perdition. And are theſe meaſures <hi>wiſe,</hi> whoſe very ſucceſs has but this for their object, and whoſe failure is ruin? Are theſe the principles, by which free men ſhould govern free men? Is this that invincible union, and that firm eſtabliſhment, by which Britain ſhall hold the Weſt Indies, in her right hand, and the Eaſt, in her left! Or is this the wiſdom which muſt heal pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic credit of a thouſand wounds, and ſupport the weight of a tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering empire? There may come a time when the diſtreſſes of Great-Britain may require the utmoſt efforts of a grateful people, and our poſterity may find, by a fatal experience, that the ſword was but an ill interpreter of charters; and that the characters of freedom, will not be leſs indelible in the breaſts of the Americans, if they be written in the blood of their forefathers. What ſhall I ſay of theſe meaſures? That they are ſo impolitic, that we ſhould reject them, though juſtice did not condemn them; that they are ſo unjuſt, that we ſhould reject them, were they ever ſo politic.</p>
            <p>THESE conſiderations I have preſumed to dedicate to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt aſſembly in the world, and to the beſt of princes. If they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry any conviction along with them, the conſequences naturally follow. Firſt, that we ſhould leave the Americans to tax them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: Secondly, that we ſhould retain to the Britiſh Parliament, every power that is not inconſiſtent with our juſtice and their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty: That a law ſhould be paſſed, immediately, repealing every act, that taxes the Colonies. I do not propoſe that it ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain any counter-declarations, or that the power ſhould, in terms, be diſclaimed. It will be ſufficient that they be repealed, and that we do not revive the claim.
<note n="‡" place="bottom">Theſe words were made uſe of, upon a different occaſion, by Mr. Flood, the brighteſt ornament of the Iriſh Parliament.</note> 
               <hi>Let it be buried in oblivion; let it hang between the conſtitutions of both countries, as belonging to nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>their. Let it be ſuſpended, like the ſword of the murderer, in the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian law, which was depoſited in their temples, as unfit to be handled; and conſecrated, as it were, not for its merit, but offence.</hi> And leſt,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:011193_0016_0F85CD8331834B00"/>at any time hereafter, it may be diſputed where the line is drawn, between American liberty and Britiſh juriſdiction, perhaps it might not be improper to declare, in the ſame law, the ſuprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Britain, and its abſolute dominion over navigation and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce. Can we aſſert the dependency of the Coloniſts, in ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger terms than thoſe of Mr. Otis, a Gentleman who is certainly well informed of their ſentiments, and who has probably a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſhare in forming them,
<q>That the Parliament of Great-Britain has undoubted power, and lawful authority, to make acts for the general good, which by naming the Colonies, ſhall, and ought to be equally binding, as upon the ſubjects of Great-Britain within the realm.</q> Should the Coloniſts complain, that if this power be reſerved, they have not the ſame degree of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or all the privileges that are poſſeſſed by their Britiſh Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, I ſhall readily confeſs that they have not: but it was not intended, by their original compact, that they ſhould. If Britain does not reſerve to herſelf an abſolute authority, over the trade of her Colonies, not one of the ends will be anſwered, for which thoſe Colonies were planted: they will not be ſubſervient to the commerce of their mother-country; they will rival and deſtroy it. And ſurely we ſhall not be deemed enemies of their freedom, in adopting the ſentiments of its able and intereſted defender. The power of regulating their commerce, and the right of prohibition, have indeed a moſt extenſive dominion, over the wealth and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of America; and thoſe demands muſt be exorbitant, indeed, which can be refuſed to an aſſembly poſſeſſed of ſo mighty a prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative. But there is a material difference, between ſtopping the acquiſition of riches, and the taking away what is already ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. They have all but a bitter alternative; but bitter as it is, <hi>they have an alternative,</hi> ſays Mr. Otis, in the true ſpirit of liberty,
<q>I had rather ſee this (right of prohibition) carried with a high hand, to the utmoſt rigour, than have a tax of one ſhilling, taken from me, without my conſent.</q>
            </p>
            <p>IT is ſo much the intereſt of Britain, to promote the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial welfare of her Colonies, that they may form a reaſonable expectation, that theſe intereſts are ſafely depoſited. But on this ſelf-intereſt, on the wiſdom and equity of the Britiſh legiſlature, and on the conciliating moderation of their own conduct much, very much, of their proſperity will depend. Of this moderation we have as yet made no trial. When we deſiſted from <hi>actual</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, we laid its <hi>future</hi> foundations, and the repeal of the Stamp-Act, was attended with the ſtrongeſt aſſertions, of our <hi>right</hi> of taxation; aſſertions which an upright adminiſtration never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to carry into experiment, but an unhappy compliment, which wiſdom and virtue paid to the temporization and prejudice. If impreſſed with a conviction of their freedom, the Americans have a ſenſe of injury, let not Britons reſent the ſentiments they have communicated. Let us maturely conſider whether we our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:011193_0017_0F85CD83F103B6D8"/>were not the aggreſſors. If force is juſtifiable in deſtroying thoſe rights, which are derived from time, from compact, and from nature; what is not juſtifiable for their maintainance and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port? If the cauſe of the Americans be juſt, their firmneſs is virtue.</p>
