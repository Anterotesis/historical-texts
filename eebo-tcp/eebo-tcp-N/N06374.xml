            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>I Obſerve, in a <hi>Proclamation,</hi> given forth by Governour <hi>Fitch,</hi> of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> at the deſire of the General Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in <hi>October</hi> laſt, under the Conſideration of the tokens of God's Diſpleaſure, by his Judgments already come upon us; and what we have cauſe to Fear is haſtening, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT is therefore Required, in order to a Reformation in ſaid Colony, in theſe Words,—<hi>A Proclamation, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſtrictly enjoining every Aſſiſtant, Juſtice of the Peace and all Grandjurymen &amp; other informing Officers within this Colony, in their reſpective Offices, duly to put in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, the Laws made for the Obſervation of the Sabbath or Lord's-Day, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I Anſwer,— There is not the leaſt command, example, name nor the leaſt breath or tittle in Scripture for ſaid Sabbath, much
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:008084_0003_102E25F54B1C96D8"/>
leſs for the obſervation of it; but comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be a day of labour, both in the Old Teſtament and New,— See Exod. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.9, 10. <hi>Six days ſhalt thou labour &amp; do all thy work, but the ſeventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God</hi> &amp;c. Mat. 26.32. <hi>But after I am riſen again, I will go before you into Galilee.</hi> Compare this with Chap. 28.1. to 10. and we may ſee, Chriſt before he ſuffered, as alſo the Angel of the Lord upon his Reſurrection, and Chriſt himſelf requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Diſciples, calling them Brethren, to go into Galilee, and there they ſhould ſee him. Here is not the leaſt word ſpoken of a Sabbath; but commanded to labour, by travailing into another Province: Luke 3.1. as alſo John 20.19. <hi>Then the ſame day, at evening, being the firſt day of the week, when the doors were ſhut where the Diſciples were aſſembled for fear of the Jews.</hi> Neither is here the leaſt tittle relating to a Sabbath, but called the firſt day of the week, as thro' out the New Teſtament; and no where called Sabbath, but firſt day of the week. And whereas you quote in your confeſſion of Faith, Chap. 22.7. parag. Rev. 1.10. <hi>I was in the Spirit on the Lord's Day,</hi> and apply the words of the Apoſtle to the firſt day of the week, and ſay, which in Scripture
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:008084_0004_102E25F6D8734318"/>
is called the Lord's Day, without any proof, from this text or any other text of Scripture, that the firſt day of the week was ever ſo intituled; or, that the Apoſtle had reference to any particular or natural day, but the time of Chriſt's revealing himſelf to him, and requiring him to write thoſe myſteries as Chriſt purpoſed to reveal them; which, for ought we know, might be as long as Moſes was with the Lord in Mount Sinai, writing the words of the Covenant, the ten Commandments, forty days and forty nights Exod 34.28. Thus you wreſt the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, by putting expoſitions of your own deviſing, contrary to Scripture, and make them the foundation of your Sabbath, which is the main principle of your Religion.</p>
            <p>And ſay,— <hi>This Confeſſion of Faith, we offer as our firm Perſwaſion; well and fully grounded upon the holy Scriptures; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the ſame unto all, and particularly to the people of our Colony; to be examined, accepted &amp; conſtantly maintained: We do not aſſume to ourſelves that any thing be taken upon truſt from us, but commend to our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple theſe following Counſels. &amp;c. Believe in all divine worſhip: It not enough, that this or that act of worſhip is not forbidden in the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:008084_0005_102E25F948E3DD18"/>
word of God. If it be not commanded and you perform it, you may fear you will be found guilty, and expoſed to divine diſpleaſure: Nadab and Abihu paid dear for offering in divine worſhip that which the Lord comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them not,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This taken out of your counſels, and much more to the ſame purpoſe, which to be brief I omit: Thus by your good words and fair ſpeeches you deceive the hearts of the ſimple. Rom. 16 18. <hi>For they that are ſuch, ſerve not our Lord Jeſus Chriſt but their own Bellies; and by good words and fair ſpeeches deceive the hearts of the ſimple:</hi> That is, ſuch as lean upon your words but don't follow your counſels, for your counſels are good; agreeing with Rom 4.15. <hi>Where no law is there is no tranſgreſſion:</hi> alſo Chap. 5.13. <hi>Sin is not imputed when there is no law.</hi> But by your flattering words &amp; wreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Scriptures, you deceive the world and worldly powers, who are all joined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a ſpirit of flattery in the love and friendſhip of the world, and ſo ſhut your ſelves out from believing in God, John 5.44. And are become enemies to God, Jam. 4.4. While you think your ſelves more righteous than others in the performance of your own inſtitutions of worſhip; but you
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:008084_0006_102E25FDC9FB1590"/>
are in danger of its turning to your greater condemnation.</p>
            <p>I alſo obſerve, in the cloſe of ſaid Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, — our preſent King intituled, Defender of the Faith, &amp;c. As alſo in the cloſe of a Proclamation, for a Faſt, the 31ſt day of Auguſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ſt; and both under ſaid Governor's hand, and doubtleſs it is his uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al manner ſo to write. It may be well for us to know how the King came by that Title, it being no Scripture title given to any King neither Jew nor Gentile; but I find the Pope gave to Henry the 8th, King of England, the Title, Defender of the Faith, and to all his Succeſſors, becauſe he wrote a Book againſt Luther, in defence of Popery, ſee the Hiſt, of Engl. N. Tindal Vol. I. Pag. 749. But ſaid Luther was an inſtrument under God, of a great reformation out of Popery, which cauſed the Pope to do his utmoſt endeavour to ſuppreſs him, and by ſucceſſion, the Title is continued to the Kings of England to this day, as we ſee; ſo that if we acknowlege the authority of the Title we muſt acknowlege the authority of the giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; which opens a door to all Popery, for the Pope gave the Title in commendation of the ſaid King, for oppoſing God's faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, for preaching againſt the ſaid Pope,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:008084_0007_102E25FFAF701E88"/>
or popiſh Idolatry; and by ſaid King and Parliament confirming and defending po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Articles, it opened a door to Biſhops, Chancellors, Prelates &amp; divers ranks of Men, both in the popiſh Church and common Wealth, to break in upon Chriſt's flock like ſo many ſorts of ravenous Beaſts, taring and devouring, and few got out of their hands, but were burnt to Death, under the name of Hereticks. Thus we may ſee the ſtupid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yea, blindneſs of our reputed wife and learned Men; to wit, the rulers and eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd Miniſters, to teſtify againſt Popery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; yet adore ſuch a popiſh title, for now 200 years or more; for faith in God i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

It is a title of Honour, and muſt needs be enſnaring to the whole Kingdom; for, if the King be defender of the Faith, then every Man in authority under him, has a ſhare in the Title,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:008084_0008_102E2603494BCA90"/>
and may be ſaid to be defenders of the Faith with the King, according to their office. Now let us ſee how far the two Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to wit, Boſton and Connecticut, have cloſed in practice with this popiſh Title, to defend their inſtitutions of Worſhip; firſt Connecticut, ſee their Law, Entituled <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> as followeth.</p>

BUT notwithſtanding the repealing this Law, there has been great Perſecutions in Connecticut Colony, by Fining, Whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and Impriſoning, and other inhumane doings, towards thoſe that under ſcruple of Conſcience, have withdrawn from their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed Worſhip.</p>
            <p>As to Boſton Government, they Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted the Annabaptiſts in 1651, by Fining, Whipping and Impriſoning, in defence of the then eſtabliſhed Worſhip: See Daniel Neal's Hiſtory of New-England, Vol. I. Pag. 278, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And the firſt People called Quakers that came from England to Boſton, was in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of July, 1656, viz. Mary Fiſher and Ann Auſtin; but before they came on Shore, the Deputy-Governor ſent on board the Ship, and took their Papers, and about 100 Books from them, and ordered them, to be kept Priſoners there until he ſhould ſend for them; and ſaid Books were Burnt by the common Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. And in the Month following, came eight more, viz. four Men and four Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Suffered in like manner: Their Boxes, Cheſts and Trunks being ſearched
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:008084_0012_102E260C26C94A70"/>
before they came on Shore; and their Books were Burnt, &amp; they committed to Priſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch as were call'd Quakers, but not for what they had done, either good or evil; and kept cloſe Priſoners, and a Five Pound Fine for any that ſhould ſpeak with them; to prevent People from having any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion or Communicating to them things not practiſed to the worſt of Murderers, together with many other Inhumanities.</p>
            <p>I here note a Speech of John Indicot, Governour of Boſton, to one that came to Boſton with thoſe aforeſaid,—<hi>Take heed,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>you break not our Eccleſiaſtical Laws, for then ye are ſure to ſtretch by a Halter</hi>— A threatning word by the Papiſts to the Martyrs, was, fry a Faggot. And ſhall we believe when God takes Vengeance on thoſe that put his Saints and Martyrs to Death by Fire and Faggots, will not Meaſure the ſame Meaſure to them that put them to Death by a Halter and Gallows. I alſo cite another ſpeach of ſaid Governour, to a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, after ſhe had been put in Priſon, and Whipt Ten Stripes, with a threefold Corded knotted Whip; <hi>That they were likely to have a Law to Hang her, if ſhe came hither again.</hi> To which ſhe anſwered,— <hi>If God call us, wo be to us if we come not: And I queſtion not, but he whom we love will make us not

to count our Lives dear unto our ſelves, for the ſake of his NAME.</hi> To which ſaid Governour replied,—<hi>And we ſhall be as ready to take away your Lives as ye ſhall be to lay them down.</hi>

A certain Woman going through Cambridge, and crying re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, was laid hold of, and had before two Magiſtrates, and was delivered to a Goaler, who thruſt her into a noyſom, ſtinking Dungeon, having nothing to lie down on, or ſit on, and kept he there two Days and two Nights, without Bread or Water; and becauſe a tender Friend brought her a little Milk in her great Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs and periſhing Condition, he was caſt

But they not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting, and under the ſame ſcruple came under the Penalty of another Five Pounds; and ſo from Time to Time. — William Allin, his Fines were Forty Pounds, for having Twenty Meetings of the people called Quakers at his Houſe, Four Pounds for being at Meetings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, Five Pounds for entertaining thoſe People, Twenty-five Pounds for not Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: They Summon them, ſaith my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, three Times a Year, as oft as they have Courts for that purpoſe; and fine them Five Pounds each, &amp;c. and to ſatisfy ſaid Fines take away their Cattle.

which was fighting againſt God himſelf, by diſregarding his Meſſage, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting his Meſſengers: Thoſe that thus Perſecuted were our Anceſtors, that left their native Land becauſe of Perſecution, and came into this, that they might in freedom Worſhip God according to their Conſciences, but ſoon ſet up the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trins and Commandments of Men to be obſerved for Worſhip to God, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed and defended them by all the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid injuſtice Violence and Cruelties, as is to be ſeen at large in ſaid Biſhope and John Whiting, both in one Volumn, containing more than 700 Pages; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is alſo obſerved the remarkable Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God on divers of the moſt Violent Perſecutors, as fore-told by the Sufferers; as alſo Cotton Mather, a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of Boſton, bewailing New-England under the Judgments of God, for now more than 20 Years, ſaith he, the Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Strokes of Heaven have rather a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated than enlarged the growth of it: There have been ſeveral Years, wherein the terrible Famine ſtared the Town in the Face: The very courſe of Nature hath been altered; among us, a lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Cry for Bread, Bread hath been heard in our Streets; peſtilential Sickneſſes have

            <p>Thus I have given the Reader, a View of the ſufferings of ſaid Quakers, and of the inhumane Cruelties done to them, taken out of ſaid Biſhope; as alſo ſaid Mather, in his late Church Hiſtory of New-England; his confeſſions to the juſt Judgment of God on them recited out of ſaid Whiting, to which ſaid Hiſtories I refer the Reader.</p>
            <p>I ſhall Cite ſome Texts of Scripture, and Conclude, Rev. 12.7, 11. <hi>And there was War in Heaven, Michael and his Angels fought againſt the Dragon, and the Dragon fought and his Angels,</hi> it was Chriſt in his Saints that fought by the Word of their Teſtimony; <hi>And they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercame him by the Blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their Teſtimony, and they loved not their Lives unto the Death.</hi> —And in the Caſe now treated on, it
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:008084_0023_102E2627E319A438"/>
was the eſtabliſhed Miniſters and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in fellowſhip together, who fought by Perſecution, under the Dragon; as in Chap. 13.6. <hi>And he opened his Mouth in Blaſphemy againſt God, to Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme his Name, and his Tabernacle, and them that dwell in Heaven.</hi> In Anſwer, to this Text, I ſhall recite ſome of the foregoing Inſtances; as firſt, Governour Endicot's Anſwer to a Woman, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid; that in obedience to God, they ſhould not count their Lives dear, &amp;c. Said Governour replied, — <hi>And we ſhall be as ready to take away your Lives, as ye ſhall be to lay them down.</hi> This was high Contempt againſt the Throne of God, and Blaſpheming his Name and his Tabernacle, and them that dwell in Heaven; and in a ſpecial Manner, ſuch Saints as ſhould ſo chearfully lay down their Lives for God's Name, and truth ſake, &amp;c. As alſo of Patience Scot aforeſaid; that they had many Children, and they had been well Educated, and that it were well if they could ſpeak half ſo much for God as ſhe could for the Devil: This was alſo Blaſphemy, to put God in the place of the Devil, and the Devil in the place of God; but ſo they Worſhip, ſee ver. 4. <hi>And
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:008084_0024_102E262B310DEC20"/>
they Worſhipped the Dragon, which gave Power to the Beaſt, and they Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the Beaſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I ſhall alſo mention one inſtance of ſaid Wilſon, Prieſt of Boſton; who ſaid
<q>he would carry Fire in one Hand, and Faggots in the other, to Burn all the Quakers in the World:</q>
Who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Friend's Books in his Hand, as they were Burning; Friend's Books by order of Authority; he threw them alſo into the Fire, ſaying,
<q>From the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil they came, and to the Devil let them go:</q>
This ſhews he was both a Blaſpheamer and a Murderer in his Heart.</p>
            <p>I deſire the Reader to take Notice. That all the aforeſaid Perſecutions were carried on to defend their form of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or image made to the Beaſt, Rev. Chap. 13 ver. 14, 15. And not the leaſt tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of a tender Conſcience toward God in it all; neither in Miniſters nor Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; for when they could not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by Cruelty and Death, to keep them out of their Government, but their Doctrine ſpread among the People, then they tried to weary them out by Fines, without regard to Conſcience or Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:008084_0025_102E262CC2CFB618"/>
Five Shillings a Week, for not coming to the allowed Meetings; and if they met among themſelves, the Fine was Forty Shillings a Time, for every Speaker, and Ten Shillings a Time for every hearer, and Forty Shillings a Time for the owner of the Place; and for refuſing to Swear, the Fine was Five Pounds, ſo often as the Oath was ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as aforeſaid, and they refuſed for Conſcience ſake, becauſe it was forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by Chriſt, Matth. 5.34, &amp;c. As alſo, James 5.12. And the not taking off the Hatt before Authority, was a Fine of Twenty Shillings; and if any entertained a Quaker, if but a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an Hour, he was to forfeit Five Pounds, ſaid Authority alſo cauſed Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Fiſher, and Ann Auſtin aforeſaid, to be ſtripped ſtart Naked, and ſo to be Searched, under a ſuſpicion of Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and miſuſed as one of them: A married Woman, and a Mother of five Children, ſuffered not the like in the bearing any of them into the World; but what proof of Witches could they have in ſo doing: But mark what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in Boſton Government, Twenty innocent Perſons were put to Death,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:008084_0026_102E262F293BB1D0"/>
for ſuppoſed Witchcraft, and above an Hundred and Fifty Impriſoned, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Two Hundred more Accuſed, and ſome fled into other Governments to ſave thair Lives; ſee Cotton Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Book of Witches, Page 110, &amp;c. But not one Quaker accuſed on that Account; ſee ſaid Whiting, Page 37.</p>
            <p>By all theſe doings, under a pretence to defend the Worſhip of God, it is evident it was to defend the Worſhip of the Devil, under all their formalities and inſtitutions of Worſhip; the Devil was the Author of all their Cruelties: And as to the Cruelties done to the Engliſh Captives by the Indians, noted by ſaid Mather, who calls them
<q>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileſs Tygers, whoſe tende. Mercies are Cruel; the worſt of Executioners, the moſt Beaſtly &amp; Bloody Things that ever wore the ſhape of Men in the World, and Devils Incarnate.</q>
Thus he Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns the Cruelties done to the Engliſh Captives by the Indians, but don't call in queſtion their Cruelties done to the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers. And as to his Confeſſions to the Judgments of God on them, in his late Church Hiſtory of New-England;
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:008084_0027_102E2631EF1ED9D8"/>

            <p>I ſay, neither ſaid Mather nor Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters have called in queſtion a word of their Perſecuting the Quakers: And many of the Quakers fore-telling the Judgments of God coming upon ſome of the moſt violent Perſecutors, which alſo came to paſs; and of God's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments coming on New-England in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; which ſaid Mather and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters have confeſſed too, but not as fore told by the Quakers; which ſhews they were in the ſame willful Blindneſs and hardneſs of Heart, and not willing that the Truth ſhould be made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt; as their Anceſtors were that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted them; which is now more than an Hundred Years paſt; firſt the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſts, then the Quakers.</p>
            <p>And as for Connecticut, from what is aforeſaid, it is evident they have
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:008084_0028_102E263462C1CBF0"/>
been vile Perſecutors; and God has been going on with his Judgments, on both Governments; and they have been going on, Worſhipping the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, under their own Inſtitutions of Worſhip; and Miniſters, in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Jeroboam's Prieſts, and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by humane Authority, which makes it the compleat Worſhip of the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon; and they Crying,
<q>What are the Evils, that have provoked the Lord to ſend his Judgments on New-England?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Will God be enquired of by ſuch a People as this? that have rebelled againſt his Warnings, and ſo inhumane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Perſecuted his Servants; and put ſome to Death, viz. Boſton, and ſay,
<q>There is not ſuch another Church in the World, as the Church at Boſton;</q> See ſaid Biſhop, Page 488.</p>
            <p>I ſay, will God be enquired or by ſuch a People as this? no verily, what ſaith the Prophet, Iſai. 1.27. <hi>Zion ſhall be redeemed with Judgment, and her Converts with Righteouſneſs.</hi> That is, the obſtinate Sinners ſhall be cut
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:008084_0029_102E2635F123B640"/>
off by God's Judgments; and thoſe that come to Repentance in Time, as to confeſs their own Sins, and the Sins of the Land, will be converted to Righteouſneſs.</p>
