            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF <hi>ROBERT JAMES.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>WHEN a private individual, who has been convicted by the laws of the country, attempts to intrude his particular concerns upon the notice of the public, it will be expected that some motive should be assigned to justify his claim to their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; how far my case may merit such attention, I must leave to be determined by the candour and impartial justice of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and enlightened people.</p>
            <p>After residing in this city four years, during which time I have experienced the sweets of friendship, the estimation of many worthy citizens, and the benefits arising from the <hi>Constitution,</hi> I humbly submit with all due deference and respect, it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that I have fallen a victim to perjury and conspiracy, my property brought with me to this country has also been taken from me without any legal authority whatever.</p>
            <p>I have been involuntarily drawn into various suits at law to recover back such property, part of it taken under executions at the suit of Mrs. Cullen's creditors by the sheriff, who assured me he was unwilling to do it, as he had no doubt of its being mine, and refused to execute the process; but those creditors had indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified him and insisted upon such proceedings, although Mrs. Cullen is very considerably indebted to me, and I was under the disagreable necessity of surrendering her to a prison in order to avoid being fixed as her bail.</p>
            <p>After this, divers persons in my absence entered my house, and not only took the remainder of my furniture, but also all my papers, Deeds, Bonds, Bills, Bank Notes, and articles of great value to me, no longer considering me under the protection of the law; and in order to justify such measures and obtain my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, divers reports were circulated respecting my conduct in England, that were not only injurious to my character, but dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to my safety, which I have reason to believe had great weight with persons in high and respectable situations, and that it had an influence on the minds of the jury no person who heard my trial can doubt; and I am very confident that no other man would have been convicted on such evidence; and although my property was taken without any legal authority, my council in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:048898_0003_1025FDB56874DB78"/>
me I have no other mode of recovering it; but by actions at law, and cannot proceed without giving security for costs, therefore the parties feel themselves confident of retaining it for ever. No attempts were made to take such property until after the present charge. I am confident that no man ever was tried under such a load of prejudice, unmerried difficulties, and embarras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, although I had contracted no debts, and my character for four years had stood unimpeached, and at my trial there was no attempt to impeach it from any matter that had ever happened in this country; but in order to fix a prejudice on the minds of the jury, it will appear from the evidence hereafter stated, an attempt was made to impeach my general character in England by three persons, one of them was proved perjured, as will also appear by the evidence.</p>
            <p>I am ready to admit that I have had my failings in common with other men, and in a greater degree than many; but I have not me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited this prosecution, nor the unjust proceedings and reports which have been taken and so industriously circulated against me, either by my conduct in this or any country; and I humbly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that the calling of witnesses to impeach my general character in England, by general reports, from which it is impossible for any man to justify himself, was improper, and is contrary to the established rules of evidence; in proof of which I shall take the liberty of mentioning one of the greatest law authorities that any country ever produced, (Lord Mansfield's) viz. <q>That in all cases the general characters of witnesses are material and may be impeached, but the character of the Defendant upon his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al shall not be impeached though he may call witnesses in sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of it. The jury are sworn to try the matter in question and are to do justice to all men alike, therefore if a defendant is known to be a bad character the jury ought to be very cautious not to receive an unfavourable impression to prejudice their minds against him by any matter but that before the court;</q> and the rules of law appear to be the same in this country founded upon the laws and practice of the courts in England, but the rules of evidence I conceive must be unsettled from the following circumstance:—Upon my Trial, Coates was a witness for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution, but my council insisted that he was not a competent witness, being called to prove that though he accepted the bill he did not believe there was such a person as the drawer, which in fact was to controvert the instrument he had signed. The honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble judges on the bench were Lewis, Benson, and Kent; judges Benson and Kent were of opinion he was competent and judge Benson observed that he thought <q>all witnesses competent, on the part of the people, but that their credibility should be strictly attended to; Judge Lewis differed from them, and was of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion he was not competent; but as the other judges were of a contrary opinion he must be examined.</q> Before my trial I had
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:048898_0004_1025FDB6EF37B138"/>
applied to know the names of the witnesses against me, which was refused; therefore I applied to the court for them to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined separate and apart, out of the hearing of each other; but to my great surprise the attorney general would not consent to this, and the court refused to order it, although I submit it is the only mode of detecting improper evidence, which I was confident must be intended, being conscious of my own innocence; this is never objected to in the courts of England; and upon a common assault tried in this city before the honourable Mr. Harrison, the recorder, it was ordered at the instance of the defendant, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the assistant attorney general, saying it was a very unusual request. The learned <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ecorder replied, "He should always think it his duty to order it when required;" the refusal was a very great and singular hardship, as I had no knowledge of who were to be the witnesses nor what was intended to be sworn against me; had such request been complied with, I have every reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there would have been much greater contradictions in the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which I shall state, and leave it to be determined how far they were entitled to credit under all the circumstances, and whether the witnesses to impeach my general character in England were entitled to greater credit than those witnesses of known honor and respectab<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ity, who proved they had known me from my first arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val in this country, to have always lived in affluence, not distressed in my circumstances, but always appeared to have money at command to assist my friends and had often assisted them, (not as a broker)—and here I must beg leave to observe that I then had many friends, because I was in affluence, without troubles or in wants of assistance. But in my present unhappy situation I have no friend nor can I reasonably expect it, when I reflect upon hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, and the undue means made use of to injure my cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter; my property taken from me, shut up within the walls of a prison from all society, to linger under an ignominious judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In such a situation who can I look up to as a friend, or how can I appeal to those laws for redress which I have been found guilty of violating? yet as it hath pleased Almighty God to spare my Life, and raise me as it were from the grave, when my spirits were so much depressed, and my health impaired by such conviction, that I neither wished for, or expected it. I feel it a duty I owe not only to myself, my family, and former connections, but to the people at large, to shew by what means I have been convic<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, and to use my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours by every just and legal means in my power, to wipe off the stigma which otherwise would be entailed upon me and my family for ever, and if possible to obtain a further enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, when I am confident that not only my innocence would be made manifest, but that I have been convicted by conspiracy and perjury; not that I mean by such appeal to impeach the justice of the court or jury by whom I was tried, nor any reflection upon
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:048898_0005_1025FDB8973E8408"/>
the honorable gentleman who conducted the prosecution, which is far from my intention, but with all due deference and respect. I have down with the greatest submission, in hopes of proving they have been deceived and imposed upon: nor is it my intention to make any further comments on the characters of the witnesses than what arises from the nature of their testimony, convinced that however bad their characters may appear, it would be no justification of my own, and shall here take the liberty of stat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the words of the honourable judge Lewis, viz. <q>That he could not reconcile the evidence of Coates and Smith, unless under an idea that I must have thought it no crime the putting a fictitious name to a bill of exchange.</q> But at the time he passed sentence, upon my asserting my innocence, and that I was convicted by perjury, that the evidence of Coates and Smith upon whose testimony I was convicted was false in every respect, he replied that <q>he could see no reason for their swearing false to convict me, but if I could manifest my innocence, the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor would pardon me</q> I trust that the reasons for their swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing false, and motives for wishing to convict me, will hereafter fully appear, and also that I had no interest or concern whatever in the forging or negociating the bill, or to receive any profit or advantage from it; I had not passed or indorsed the bill, yet was called upon to prove who was the drawer upon Mr. Coates, and who indorsed it to Mrs. Cullen, she was the only person to prove by what means she became possessed of the bill, therefore I cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her as a witness, the attorney general objected to her being examined, as she also was indicted, but has since been tried and acquitted; if I had not been thus deprived of her testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony I could have proved all that was required, which appears by her deposition made since my trial, and I feel confident that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all the circumstances, upon duly considering the testimony of Coates and Smith, it appears so improbable that it will not obtain credit; those who know me never could believe them, unless they supposed me entirely deprived of my senses; my council and Mrs. Cullen's also, pressed for her trial to come on first, which was objected to; bysuch means any innocent person may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed where such witnesses are concerned; it is only to indict the party who can prove his innocence and not permit them to be tried first. In England, upon several persons being included all in one indictment where the prosecutor could only make out a case against part, those affected called for an acquittal of the others before they entered upon their defence in order to have the benefit of their testimony, which was ordered; this was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an indictment for a conspiracy, and I submit the law is the same in every other case, and would be dangerous to establish a contrary doctrine. I shall proceed to state all the evidence in substance and effect given upon my trial, to the best of my judgment with candour and impartiality; and although I do not
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:048898_0006_1025FDBDD4887C28"/>
conceive my character in England ought to have any connection with this business, I shall relate the circumstances upon which my enemies grounded such reports to obtain my ruin, and do most solemnly declare in the presence of Almighty God, and those to whom this case will be submitted, that truth and candor shall be my guide through the whole of this statement, and as my abilities are very unequal to direct my pen with that energy I wish, particularly in my present situation, without advice or assistance, I shall not attempt to embellish either my case or my conduct through life, which in some instances have been exceptionable, but I trust not such as would induce such uncharitable conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, or that I could never after become a good member of soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety. I shall lay myself open and submit to the justice, discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and liberal sentiments of an enlightened people, and shall mention the places of abode of the witnesses for such enquiry as may be thought proper, that it may be judged how far under all the circumstances they deserve credit, and under a conviction so obtained, whether the rigid rules of law render it necessary that I should remain shut up in a prison, without further enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, from all society, to linger out the remainder of my days in ignominy and disgrace.</p>
            <p>N. B. It has been reported that I was an attorney in England, but I never was. My wife's father was a master in chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and I became some little acquainted with the law and practice of the courts.</p>

               <head>JOHN COATES, a prisoner for debt at defendant's suit.</head>
               <p>That about the month of October, Mr. James asked him to accept two bills which he wanted to settle some debts of Mrs. Cullen's—that he did not like to accept them, but James said he would take care of them—that they were drawn by a friend of his at Philadelphia—that he accepted them but did not observe by whom they were drawn—that he did not know the drawer; the bill produced was one of them, the other was for 250 dollars—that he was afterwards uneasy about it, and requested Mr. Smith, a friend of his, to call with him upon James, as he had frequently desired James to inform him who was the drawer and indorser, but he put him off, saying they were friends of his and he would take care of them—that Smith called with him at James's house, he was very civil, and produced the bill for 250 dollars and tore off the acceptance and gave it him, said he would get the other, but the holder was out of town—that he then desired to know who was the drawer and indorser; James laughed, and said it would be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to find them—the bills were both the same hand writing, drawn and indorsed the same, except the sum which was for 250 dollars—that his first knowledge of James was taking out a warrant against him for six shillings, after that James lent him 100 dollars for a friend of his, which he paid him and offered to pay for the use, which he would not take, but said you may some time or another serve me—that he was first induced to believe the bill forged, as they appeared to be wrote with ink of the same color as his acceptance, which he wrote in James's parlor—said the bill was drawn and indorsed with ink the same color as his acceptance, was sure it appeared so by the bill (which was then produced, and upon examination appeared all different inks and hand writings)—that he never said he would hang James or that he wished to see him hanged—that he did not a short time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the trial take James by the arm and request him to be friends and bare no malice—that no such thing ever passed—never begged to be friends—admitted he was bail about the month of October and justified, and that James prevented his having the three-fourth act, and had arrested him upon the note produced, (which was for 100 dollars, on Robert Charnley, indorsed by Coates, Smith and Daniels, with Smith's name struck through with a pen)—that he purchased hats of James, and gave him a note on Mr. Smith for 24 dollars at 90 days—admitted the note (which was produced, both bills passed due and unpaid)—admitted he had not put them in his schedule to take the benefit of the act, nor the forged bill in question, but admitted he was liable for it—said that as he and Smith were going home from James's, Smith told him that James acknowledged he drew the bills himself.</p>

               <p>Having stated the substance and effect of all the evidence gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven on the trial, with all due deference I beg leave to submit the following <hi>observations,</hi> to shew the improbability of the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of John Coates and James Smith, and of my committing the offence.</p>
               <p>It will be readily admitted there are few men will ever commit a bad act, particularly when attended with such penal consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, without some prospect of advantage, and here could be none to me, and to Mrs. Cullen would have been the heighth of injus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and cruelty, without any assistance except delaying the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of two hundred dollars for forty days, and then subject her not only to be sued but to an indictment, when it was prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beyond all doubt that I had it in my power to assist her with cash if I thought proper; but suppose I had wished her to nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate such bills, for a dollar I might have procured half a dozen names that would have done as well as fictitious ones, and then the law could not have affected her or me. But suppose me ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of such cruelty, injustice, and folly, can it be believed that I should have been so great an ideot as to acknowledge it to Coates, the very person it was intended to deceive, and in the presence of his friend Smith, when there could be no evidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me; therefore to answer no other purpose than to expose
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:048898_0012_1025FD3C58A76E90"/>
myself, and after this, go and inform Mr. Rose where to find him, and recommended that gentleman to arrest him for payment of the bill I had acknowledged to have forged and promised to take care of; surely this cannot be believed of a man of great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress, and very cunning man as Smith proved me; or that such a man would make him his companion and confident, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten invite him to drink wine at his house. I will do Mr. Smith the justice to say that his person, address and appearance is not likely to deceive or subject him to the confidence or acquaintance of any man who wishes to support either <hi>character, credit, or a genteel appearance;</hi> every person is respectable that performs the duties of his situation; but such a man as Mr. Smith (I shall only say a hackney coachman) would feel very aukward to be made the companion and confident of such person as he describ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me. I am confident the observation must be very striking to those who know us. But if this was the case why should I <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ue Mr. Smith for only twenty four dollars, after I was charged with this forgery? He did not give evidence to obtain the warrant nor in any manner appeared in the business until the morning of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al: surely if I had made such confession in his presence, I must have known it, and having intrusted him with a secret of so much importance, should have continued him my friend and compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and it was clearly proved that I had it in my power to be friends with Mr. Coates a short time before my trial. Mr. Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris proved, and many other respectable witnesses can prove, that, Coates took me by the arm and begg'd I would shake hands and be friends, and bare no malice for what had passed; he well knew the effect this must have had on the minds of the jury, and on being asked the question, positively denied it, also denied that he ever damn'd me for preventing his taking the benefit of the three fourth act, or for keeping him in prison, or said that he would hang me if he could, all which I can prove by at least six witnesses. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, Mr. Borris proved sufficient to shew that I might have made friends with him before the trial. It would have been a fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate circumstance for me if I had been guilty, in which case I should have made friends with Coates, and then Smith would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have been heard of as a witness; but confident of my inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence I spurned at his attempt to shake hands, and not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued him in prison but prevented his taking the benefit of the three fourth act, for which Mr. Smith was his petitioning credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, for near three hundred pounds, yet could not pay me a note of twenty four dollars, but after judgment against him, procured his friend David John Daniels to be bail for his g<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

oath that he had been insolvent upwards of two years, owed three thousand pounds, and had not a shilling to give up to his creditors, although only a few months before he had been bail in a great number of actions and justified himself worth large sums of money after payment of all his debts. Mr. Munro also knows the degree of credit due to the testimony of him and Smith, as he calls himself, but whose real name is Arrowsmith, which can be proved by Arthur C. Beaumont, <abbr>Esq</abbr> and by the bail prises in that name. Colonel Moreton and the justices of the ten pound court, well knew Smith's real name, at least what he used to go by, and the degree of credit due to him, Coates, and their friend David John Daniels.</p>
               <p>Since I have been convicted, Colonel Moreton had the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to inform me he well knew them, and would not take their oaths for a penny. But they have taken a very effectual means of preventing my giving them any further opposition, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding to recover my property. I submit that such circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, and what will hereafter appear, involves great suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion on the testimony of such men, particularly as Coates proves himself not only implicated, but the principal in the crime he has fixed on me: He accepts bills drawn upon him in the name of Thomas Smith, and upon being pressed for payment, he insist upon it there is no such person as the drawer, and six months after they are due goes before a magistrate and depose that he accepted the bill in question for me, and he suspected there was no such person as Thomas Smith the drawer. But finding that he could not frighten me by such step, and that such evidence would not be sufficient to convict me, he brings forward his friend Smith at the trial, and they prove, <hi>not suspect,</hi> but that I acknowledged the bills drawn by me, and that there was no such person as either the drawer or indorser. And also that a bill for two hundred and fifty dollars, Coates said I tore off his acceptance and gave him, but Smith stated the bill was burnt; Smith also proved that I acknowledged writing the bill myself, Coates only that Smith told him I said so. But what could induce them both to make a mistake in the amount of the bill destroyed, yet both agreed in such mistake, viz. that the sum was 250 dollars. Mr. Hyslop, a merchant of respectability, proved that he was in possession of the bill for some days, and the sum was 255 dollars; his surely is a strong circumstance to induce a belief they had agreed upon the testimony they were to give, though they differed in some respects. Coates in his evidence states, his first acquaintance with me, was taking out a warrant against me for six shillings, (which is the truth, as will be hereafter explained.) This is a pretty strong reason for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving he would not rely uopn the honor of such a man, who would not pay six shillings without a warrant; yet after this accepts two bills for 450 dollars without any receipt, or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking

to shew, though he had no knowledge of the drawer—did not believe there was any such person; by what means was he to recover the money from me, supposing he had paid the bills. My confession in the presence of Smith is stated to have been long after such acceptance, but my saying I would provide for them was sufficient, yet had before proved I had not the honor to pay six shillings.

The accepter of a bill is presumed to know the drawer, and the person who pass a bill is presumed to know from whom they received it, which appears by the last indorsement; but will the law permit the accepter of a bill to prove the drawer upon whom he please? If this is law no man is safe, and opens a very wide field for fraud. What man after my conviction would endeavor to compel the payment of a bill, or resist the vile proceedings of such men. I who never had the least concern with the bill am called upon to prove who drew it upon Coates, and also who passed it to Mrs. Cullen, who I was not permitted to call upon as a witness, because they had thought proper to indict her also, or she would have proved who she received it from, and for whom Mr. Coates accepted it. Mrs. Cullen's servants proved that Wicks the indorser was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to her, and she has since mentioned a circumstance which puts that matter past all doubt.

I was in court when the bill of indictment was presented against me, and informed Mr. Riker, who assured me I must be mistaken, for the Attorney General was incapable of such deception. I mean no imputation upon that honorable gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, who I also believe is incapable of endeavoring to entrap or deceive any man; but it warrants this inference, that he was not then acquainted with Smith's evidence, knew of no other than what appeared by the depositions before the magistrate on which the warrant was obtained. I have strong reasons for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the bills drawn for the purpose of imposing on Mrs. Cullen, by the contrivance of Coates and Wicks, to get more goods from her. If I had acknowledged forging this bill and promised to pay it, why did Coates and Smith apply to me five months after, to purchase some hats, which they heard I had <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

At this time I had a note of Charnley's passed due and unpaid; with a view of securing this note to be paid, I consented, and went to Newark and paid the money, on Mrs. Charnley's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise (her husband being absent) that all the property should be sent to my house; but she afterwards informed the Coates took care she should not perform her promise, and had not only kept all the goods but her clothes likewise; this is all I ever had to do with Coates except selling him the hats, for which I had Smith's note indorsed by him.</p>
               <p>I shall now state how I came by the note on Charnley, which was indorsed by Coates, Smith and David John Daniels, to whom I gave the cash—Daniels I had known in England by the name of John Jenkins, and he was acquainted with a circumstance there I wished not to be known in this country, fearful of being censured (which I had ever been careful to avoid) by those not acquainted with the particulars, which I shall hereafter state. He applied to me in great distress, just discharged from New-York gaol, and requested I would give him cash for that note which was at thirty days; I gave him the cash, and when it became due he brought me another exactly the same, but at sixty days, which I received, and gave him the other; I also lent him twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty five dollars to purchase some cloth to make me some clothes, as he is a taylor, but he thought proper to keep the money. When this note became due, not being paid, which was the 29th of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 1797, (three weeks after the date of the forged bill) I gave it to Arthur C. Beaumont, <abbr>Esq</abbr> attorney in this city, and desired hi<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> to give Notice to the Indorsers of the Non-payment, which he did, except to Coatcs, who had absconded; I threatened to sue Smith, when he called upon me, which I believe was the first time I ever saw him, and assured me that the indorsement was not his hard writing, that Daniels had forged it; <hi>this I communicated to Mr. Beaumont,</hi> who informed me they were a bad set, that his name was Arrowsmith, but assured me Smith did not deny it's being his writing when he gave him notice of the non-payment; rather than have any words with such people, I consented to strike his name off upon Daniel's paying me the twenty five dollars he ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, and on his promise to pay the bill soon, which he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged was not Smith's writing, that Smith's wife wrote it; this is the note I sued Coates for.—Another <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> cumstance will prove my opinion of Coates. A few days before the time, he pretends to have accepted the forged bills for me. William T. Broom,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:048898_0017_1025FD4AF6AEF278"/>
                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> Attorney at Law in this city, informed me that Daniels had applied to him to accept Coates as Bail for a man he had ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested, stated him to be a good man and that I knew him; I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Mr. Broom that I was surprised he should mention my name, as I assured him that I knew very little of him, and what I did know was not much in his favor; advised him not to take him; as I would not. Surely this had not the appearance of my wishing to raise money or pass bills on Coate's credit, in which case I should certainly have given him a good character. It will appear upon enquiry, that Coates, Smith and Daniels, were common hired bail, and bail for each other whenever arrested. Coates was bail for Mrs. Cullen, for which she has since informed me he extorted money from her, and imposed upon her these bills I have no doubt. As to <hi>David John Daniels,</hi> whose name is <hi>John Jenkins,</hi> as will appear by the evidence of Mr. Coster, merchant, Pearl-Street, made his escape from the Fleet Prison in London, about three years ago, and came over to this country in the name of Daniels, as a servant to Mr. John Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, a prisoner in the State Prison, who was arrested soon after his arrival in this country for a large sum of money; when Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niels presented himself before the judge as bail, and offered (and I believe did) to swear himself worth ten thousand pounds or thereabouts; but Mr. Coster, who was the agent employed against Watson, attended, and proved all I have mentioned, and can prove much more; upon which he was rejected. Daniels not being able to get any more money from me, and my refusing to countenance several very dishonorable matters which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, began to be very troublesome, until at length I forbid him my house. He then distributed divers inflamatory papers, which he stuck up at my house and several other places, for which I su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out a writ against him in the mayor's court, and upon my trial had the consummate impudence to appear as a witness to impeach my character in England, although he had some time before in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Judge Pendleton as I was riding past, that he knew me in England, was a very respectable man there, of great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty.—It fully appears from the evidence of Mr. Borris, that he informed me of Coate's threats a short time before my trial, at which time I was at full liberty, and must have known of my acknowledgements to him and his friend Smith if I had ever made them. Surely this was sufficient to alarm a guilty man, and send him from a place where he had no particular business to call his attention and attendance; no family connection whatever. But if my own safety was so very indiffererent; wi<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

<pb n="19" facs="unknown:048898_0018_1025FD4CF8335058"/>
injury, but proceed to irritate them by every means in my power; all this must be reconciled as the conduct of a man of address, a very cunning man, to induce a belief of my guilt. I feel for that poor woman and her children, more than myself, for send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her to prison where she yet remains for debt, and has been sued for the very bill I am found guilty of forging; many at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts were made use of to induce her to believe I had ill treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, and to swear false against me; but not with standing her sufferings, which she might have avoided by such means, she resisted the attempt with indignation, and has made an affidavit of all the facts which hereafter appears; at the time the indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was found, on being taken into court, I requested to be tried immediately, which the Attorney General declined, but upon my consulting with council, though they assured me there was no danger, recommended me to send to Trenton for the servant, who knew of Mrs. Cullen's receiving the bill in a letter from Wicks, as they heard it was intended to prove the bill my hand writing; but Mr. Riker, who is well acquainted with my hand writing, obtained a sight of the bill, and assured me it had no resemblance of my writing, but he heard Coates was to prove it, therefore recommended my having such persons in court as knew my writing, and also to the character of Coates, to those points only my witnesses were subpoenaed. At the trial this was not attempted, but Coates stated, that his inducement for believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bills forged, was in consequence of their being wrote with ink all of the same colour as his acceptance, which he wrote in my parlor; being asked more particularly whether he meant the bill produced, he answered yes, that the drawing, and indorsements, appeared wrote all with ink of the same colour as his acceptance, but the bill being produced proved this to be false; the acceptance, drawing, and indorsement, were all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent coloured ink, and hand writings, this is a clear proof of perjury, without any evidence whatever. Another circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance will prove him perjured without the assistance of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; his schedule delivered upon oath in or about the month of April last, proves him to have been insolvent for two years before. His affidavits made in the Mayor's Court from the month of July 1797, to January 1798, states himself worth double the sums after paying all his debts, for which he then became bail; therefore I trust no person can believe him, or his friends Smith and Daniels worthy of credit. I submit that I have not only proved this, and their being all connected to ruin me, but also that they actually committed perjury to convict me; without any allusion to those matters, which renders their testimony so extremely improbable, that it is utterly impossible to believe their evidence; I also submit that I have clearly shewn their motives and interests in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, and for their circulating such false and wicked reports to injure me; but for such reports I am ready to believe (what
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:048898_0019_1025FD4ED5371F30"/>
is so commonly spoken of and believed,) that no other man would have been convicted upon such evidence, nor would any such attempt have been made on any other man; my character being destroyed, was a sufficient ground work for my ruin, a bad man is supposed capable of every thing, however improbable; the circumstance that gave weight to such impeachment of my character, is as follows: In the year 1790 a friend of mine, a debtor in the Fleet Prison, London, upon some trifling dispute with the keeper, was put into a damp dungeon; bei<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>g a bad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, he sent for his doctor, who assured the keeper that if he was continued there it would cause his death, he refused to release him; I obtained order of Lord Loughborough to release him, who was then chief justice of the common plea, but having been kept seventeen days in such confinement, he lingered for about a month and died; upon his death he requested me to bring forward a prosecution for the good of others, which was done by subscription. I was very active in it though not a witness, and presented an indictment against the keeper for murder, which was found a true bill, but one of the principal witnesses being taken very ill, and the court refusing to put off the trial, he was acquitted, and then the keeper indicted me, the doctor of the deceased, and several other persons for a conspiracy: he also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted me and several others for effecting the escape of a prison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; upon the first indictment we were tried and acquitted, after the examination of all the keeper's witnesses, without being call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon for a defence, which I begged the court would enter upon, assuring them I was then preparéd to prove the murder, but this was refused; I was discharged from the other indictment upon my own recognizance, but was afterwards tried and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed, upon an affidavit being read supposed to be made by the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners who escaped, which was afterwards proved to be false and forged; the keeper was therefore discharged from employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and I received his Majesty's most gracious pardon.</p>
               <p>At this time Daniels, in the name of Jenkins, was the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Tap at Newgate. This prosecution against the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er caused me a number of very powerful enemies, (which every man is subject to that resist such persons) particularly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst some Lottery Office Keepers, who paid the Keeper a year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly stipend for having their names on his books as debtors, and living in the rules, this being some protection for them they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on unlawful insurances in the lottery; I ordered Suits to be commenced against them, and recovered many penalties; they then charged me with receiving such penalties, and settling some of the suits without leave of the court. I was called upon to answer that charge; and upon such answer I was indicted, upon an Indictment containing twenty three counts, and gave one hundred pounds bail; but having such a host of enemies by the advice of my Friends, I paid the 1001. and agreed to leave the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:048898_0020_1025FD540964E840"/>
country for a little time, as I had been in the contest for several years; but this did not satisfy. One of the Lottery office keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers was also the printer of a Newspaper; he caused a number of illiberal paragraphs to be inserted in many of the newspapers and magazines to prejudice such persons as were not acquainted with me or the circumstance, which I have reason to believe was to prevent my return. The circumstance of the indictment for murder gave me great trouble and many enemies, yet I shall ever consider it as a meritorious act, which gives me pleasure on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection. I have now fully stated what brought me acquainted with Daniels, and have given my enemies such power over me, and also the colour to such reports, and would proceed to state every circumstance of my life, but fear I have already tired the patience of the reader, being entirely unconnected with the present mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. With respect to my character in this country (except my connection with Daniels) no man can impeach, and those in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, I have fully stated that can with truth be alledged against me. Many respectable persons in England will not only prove that they believed my character has been impeached unjustly, but that I ever acted honorably, and did not leave my country in debt.</p>
               <p>I shall now beg leave to submit a few general observations, to shew that if the evidence was true, which I trust can never be supposed it does not appear sufficient to warrant a conviction for forgery, and uttering a bill of exchange with intent to defraud. Coates proved that he accepted the bill for me, and that I promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to provide for it. Smith that I acknowledged in his presence to have both drawn and indorsed it. This was not imitating the hand writing of any man, because they prove there is no such person; at all events it cannot be pretended to defraud Coates, who states he accepted it for me. Then who was it to defraud? not Mr. Irvin—I never negociated it to him or any person whatever, nor is there any attempt to prove that I did, for what appears to the contrary it might have been taken from my desk by some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and passed away without my knowledge—Would this have subjected me to any prosecution, under the act to prevent forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries commiting with intent to defraud? I submit not, and that the commiting a Forgery is no Offence, unless with intent to defraud. Suppose I had made such bill with intent to pass it, and upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection saw the bad consequences attending it, and altered my mind, could I be said to have commited an offence within that act. Supposing all the evidence true, I conceive it was no proof of my guilt; whether I was guilty or innocent could only be proved by Mrs. Cullen; she uttered the bill, and was to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count how she came by it. I am presumed to be guilty because my character was impeached.—I will readily admit the writing of a fictitious name upon a bill with intent to defraud, is an offence within the act, but that intent must be proved by an attempt to obtain property or credit, either for himself or another. I sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:048898_0021_1025FD55CF565888"/>
there never was a conviction before, either in this country or in England, for a man's writing a fictitious name upon a bill or slip of paper, to answer no purpose whatever. There was no at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to prove the bill my hand writing, or that I ever received or attempted to obtain any profit or advantage from it, only the accepter proves he does not know the drawer, his friend proves that I confessed I wrote it myself.</p>
               <p>I shall content myself with the observations I have made, and proceed to state the depositions of Mrs. Cullen and her servants, first earnestly soliciting the pardon of those gentlemen whose names I have found necessary to introduce, and for such parts as may appear immaterial and unconnected: and shall now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude by appealing to the candour and impartiality of every man of this free and independent country, renowned for justice, wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, humanity, and liberal sentiments, heretofore revered as an asylum and security from unjust persecutions, in full confidence that no sophistry, artful insinuations or illiberal reports, will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence their opinions, but consider it as a case that may soon be their own, and that the establishment of such a verdict so obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, would render a very dangerous precedent in this commercial country.</p>

               <p>Eliza Cullen, of the city of New-York, widow, late boarding-house keeper, being duly sworn, upon her oath saith, That in the month of October, in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and ninety seven, this deponent received by the post from Philadelphia, a letter with two bills of exchange, drawn as appeared at Philadelphia in the name of Thomas Smith, payable to John Wicks or order, the one for 200 dollars, and the other for 255 dollars, and to the best of this deponent's recollection, they were drawn at forty and fifty five days after date, and directed to Mr. John Coates, merchant, Pearl-street, New-York, that they were sent by John Wicks to this deponent in part payment of 500 dollars due from him to this deponent, and indorsed by the said John Wicks; that deponent's servant Mary Potter, delivered the said letter with the bills inclosed to this deponent, and on the day deponent received them, or on the next day, the said John Coates called at this deponent's then house in Wall-street, that being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well not able to go down stairs, this deponent delivered the said bills to another of deponent's servants, Elizabeth Potter, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions for to get the said John Coates to accept them: she
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:048898_0022_1025FD57C7970228"/>
soon returned with them accepted, and deponent requested the said Robert James, the defendant, to give cash for them, which he refused, and deponent paid the bill for 200 dollars to Carruthers and Irwin, in discharge of a debt deponent owed to them of 150 dollars or thereabouts, and they paid the balance, and deponent indorsed the said bill, for which this deponent has been sued since the conviction of the said Robert James, who had not any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est whatever in the said bill, nor no interest or concern in this deponent's negociating it, nor did he know the time when or to whom the said bill was negociated, nor had the said Robert James any interest or concern in the other bill which was for 255 dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, which deponent paid to Mr. Hyslop in discharge of a debt deponent owed him, but he afterwards returned it to this deponent, saying, he did not like Coates and could not bear any satisfactory account of the drawer, and saith, that the said Coates soon after absconded from his house in Pearl-Street, and removed his fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture in the night without paying his rent, as deponent was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and verily believes, therefore deponent thought proper to return the bill for 255 dollars by the post, directed to John Wicks, to be left at the Post-Office, Philadelphia, and positively saith that Robert James never had any interest or concern in the said bill which deponent returned to Philadelphia as aforesaid, so that what Coates and Smith gave evidence upon said James's trial res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the bill being destroyed in their presence must be entirely false and unfounded, and positively saith that before deponent paid away either of the said bills Coates assured her were very good, and that Smith the drawer was a merchant living at Philadelphia, and was a very good man, but that he would take care to pay them when due, and wanted this deponent to let him have some other goods which Wicks had wrote for, desiring deponent to deliver them to Coates, which deponent refused until the bills were paid, and deponent has never heard from Wicks since but has reason to believe Coates is connected with him, and saith, that after the bill for 200 dollars was due, Coates assured deponent it should be paid, but deponent about three months after was surrendered to prison by the said Robert James the defendant, who was bail for depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in several suits, and deponent has been in prison ever since, and was tried for uttering the said bill knowing it to be forged, but acquitted, and saith, that John Wicks the Indorser of that bill, was indebted 500 dollars to deponent, as may be seen by this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent's schedule in Mr. Harrison the recorder's office, delivered and sworn to several months before any charge was made of forg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing said bill, either against deponent or the said James; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent saith, she has reason to believe the said charge was found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in malice, to extort money from the said James, or some other undue purpose, as a short time before his trial the said Coates, in the presence of this deponent, her daughter, Mr. John Borris and several other persons, took the said Robert James by the arm and
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:048898_0023_1025FD5BA0F03488"/>
requested to shake hands and be friends and bare no nalice for what had passed, which James refused, or to speak with him: and he the said Coates then swore he would be revenged of him, and saith, that the said Robert James boarded with deponent about four years, appeared to be a man of fortune, and paid ready mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for every thing, kept and appeared to have no other than gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
