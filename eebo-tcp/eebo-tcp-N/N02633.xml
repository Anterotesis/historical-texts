            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

He then proceeds to remove any offence his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Impriſonment at <hi>Rome</hi> might have occaſioned, by aſſuring them that they had been ſo far from being any Impediment to the progreſs of the Goſpel, that on the Contrary they had rather tended to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement thereof. For the Goſpel, by the means of his Sufferings for it, came to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

And withal by his Example of Suffering &amp; Patience, many of the Brethren were Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated to Profeſs CHRIST and Preach the Goſpel, with more Zeal and Courage. Some indeed ſays he, did it <hi>out of Envy,</hi> and by way of Emulation, not deſigning to Advance the Glory of CHRIST, but to add to his preſent Afflictions. But others out of Love to him and the Goſpel, knowing that what had befallen him was in Defence of the Goſpel.</p>

                  <hi>We are bought with a Price,</hi> 1 Cor. VI. 20. And by Virtue of that Price, <hi>We are quickned together with him,</hi> Eph. II. 5.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) <hi>HE is ſo as he Conveyeth this Life to us by the SPIRIT.</hi> He by the Spirit, quickens us with a Divine Life. It is the ſpecial work of the Spirit to apply CHRIST, to carry on the Work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he has begun in Redemption. Tho' he be of equal Glory with the FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER, &amp; SON, yet he Acts as from CHRIST, conveying Life in, and through, &amp; by Him. For <hi>CHRIST who has Life in Himſelf</hi> does Derive it to whom he will, <hi>John</hi> V. 21, 26. and <hi>John</hi> VI. 57. He acquired by his Merits on the Croſs a right to ſend, and promiſed to ſend the Spirit for this End. <hi>John</hi> XVI. 7, 13, 14, 15. CHRIST then is the Author of Spiritual Life; and this is the firſt thing here intended, A Spiritual Union to Chriſt, whereby we receive Life from Him, and are made to live unto Him &amp; to GOD by Him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>IT intends the Dedicating our ſelves Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſervedly and Sincerely to Him.</hi> The owning Him as our LORD, to whom all the Honour and Fruit of our Lives is Firſtly and Pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly due. He is to be Practically acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by us, as our rightful Owner and Lord. This was one End CHRIST aimed
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:003122_0005_0FF002505F69C368"/>
at, in what he has Done and Suffered for us that he might acquire a new right to us, &amp; lay us under the moſt engaging Obligations to him. Rom. XIV. 7, 8, 9. <hi>For none of us liveth to himſelf, and no Man dieth to himſelf. For whether we Live, we Live unto the LORD, and whether we Die, we Die unto the LORD. For to this End CHRIST both Died, &amp; Roſe, and Revived, that he might be LORD both of the Dead and the Living.</hi> Our Duty is to Devote our ſelves, our all to GOD, whatever may be uſeful to the Manifeſtation of his Glory. This ſeems to be what the Apoſtle had principally in his Eye, That if his Life were ſtill continued in the World, it ſhould be employed in Serving and Glorifying CHRIST, He had choſen Him for his LORD and Devoted himſelf to be his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and Faithful Servant; and he would not Recede from his Reſolution, but Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in a conſtant attendance to his Duty. When therefore Perſons are either Glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing GOD, in a Faithful attendance to the Duties of their General Calling, doing the work of Chriſtians, exerciſing and growing in Grace, working out their Salvation with Fear and Trembling, or doing the Duties of their particular Calling in Obedience to CHRIST, filling up the Duties of their Places and Relations, in a Subſerviency to the will
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:003122_0006_0FF00252CCBB0498"/>
of CHRIST, This is to Live to CHRIST. This the ſame Apoſtle ſhews us by his own Example, when he tells us, he valued not his Life for it Self, but for the Service which during the continuance of it he might do unto CHRIST. Acts XX. 24. <hi>Neither count I my Life Dear, ſo that I may Finiſh my Courſe with Joy,</hi> &amp;c. And then as our All, is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Reſerve to be Devoted to him, ſo all is <hi>to be done Heartily and Sincerly</hi>: Not in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and appearance, but with a Real and Gracious bent of Heart. There are many make ſhews of Honouring GOD, while they are only Serving of themſelves; Hence GOD ſays <hi>to them,</hi> Zech. VII. 5. <hi>When ye Faſted, Did ye do it at all to Me</hi>? So is it in any other Services, wherein Men make a fair Profeſſion as if they had a Zeal for the Honour of CHRIST, and a deſire to Promote it; when really their aim is no higher than Self. To Serve it way be a Spirit of Pride and Oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or to bring about ſome Carnal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign &amp; Intereſt. Theſe ſerve not CHRIST but themſelves in all they do. But GOD requires and expects an Upright Heart in all we do; Not only doing the things he requires of us, but the doing of them with Gracious Aims and Intentions, Eyeing His Glory in all we do, and doing all as in His ſight. Where there are ſuitable Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions

of the Glorious Excellencies of CHRIST, a Senſe how worthy He is to be ſerved with our Beſt, &amp; the greateſt Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Engagedneſs of Heart, it will teach us to Baniſh all Sineſter reſpects, and make us upright before GOD, to do what He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires in a right manner, and to do every thing unto His Glory, <hi>As Veſſels fitted for our Maſters <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe, and prepared unto every Good Work.</hi> 2 Tim.

               <p n="2">II. TO ſhew <hi>How Death is Gain to ſuch.</hi> This may appear Strange to ſuch as are Strangers to this Life of CHRIST, who judge of their Felicity by what is preſent and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and think That only makes to their Happineſs which ſerves to their Uſe, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Delight in this preſent State; and therefore they count that which ſeparates them from theſe things are Evil; yea the worſt of Evils. To whom no wonder is it, <hi>if Death proves the King of Terrors.</hi> But this is a Truth every Believer will aſſent to, tho' perhaps under the prevailings of Indwelling Sin, too much Carnality of Heart and Inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinacy of Affection to Carnal things, they are ready to ſhrink from Death as an Enemy. But the certainty hereof will appear if we
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:003122_0007_0FF002558AB1A7D8"/>
Conſider in what reſpects Death is Gain to a Believer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. THIS appears if <hi>we conſider the Evils and Miſeries, that ſuch are hereby delivered from.</hi> This World is to Believers (as well as to others) a Vale of Tears; and upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny accounts more ſo to them than to others. GOD never intended their Felicity and Portion here. They have here their Evil things, and hereafter they will have their Good things. In this <hi>Tabernacle they Groan, being Burthened,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> V. 4. But hereafter their Burthens ſhall be Removed. They have <hi>Burthens here in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with others</hi>; a Burthen of Care, Labour, Wearineſs, Bodily Pains, Weakneſs, and many Infirmities. Theſe are Fruits of Sin, which GOD ſees neceſſary for His own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to be Exerciſed with as well as others. But at their Death they find an End of all theſe. The Grave is a place of Reſt to the Body, and HEAVEN a place of Reſt to the Soul. <hi>Job</hi> III. 17. <hi>Rev.</hi> XIV. 13. And they have alſo their ſhare in the <hi>common Calamities and Miſeries,</hi> that GOD brings upon the World. They are a part of the Body and therefore ſuffer with it. But at Death they are taken from this Community, and are delivered from the Burthens and Exerciſes
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:003122_0007_0FF002558AB1A7D8"/>
thereof, and <hi>Secured from the Evils to Come,</hi> Iſa. LVII. 1, 2. Beſides theſe <hi>there are Evils more peculiar to them</hi>; Others are under ſome of them indeed, but they don't feel them as ſuch, and complain of them as their Miſery as they ought to do. The <hi>Activity and Power of Indwelling Sin,</hi> which ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in them is a great Exerciſe to them. By reaſon of it they are ſo Clogged, Indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and out of Frame and Unfit for any Holy &amp; Spiritual Actions &amp; Employments, that when <hi>they ſhould do Good, Evil is Preſent</hi> with them. They are led into Captivity to the Law of Sin remaining in their Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. They are often Groaning under this, as their Burthen. Yea as a Burthen too heavy for them. Pſal. XXXVIII. 3, 4, 6, 8. There is <hi>no Reſt in my Bones becauſe of my Sin. Mine Iniquities are gone over mine Head, as an Heavy Burden they are too Heavy for me. I am troubled, I am bowed down greatly; I go Mourning all the Day long. I am Feeble and Sore broken: I have Rored by reaſon of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſs of my Heart.</hi> Rom. VII. 24 <hi>Oh Wretched Man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the Body of this Death?</hi> And by reaſon of this they often fail in their Duty to GOD and Man, and the beſt they do iſ but imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly done. But now they are through CHRIST made Victorious over this, it ſhall
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:003122_0008_0FF002574AD5A2C8"/>
never Trouble them any more. This Body of Sin being deſtroyed they are made Perfect. Here alſo they are Burthened with many <hi>Temptations and Trials,</hi> from <hi>Satan</hi> and <hi>the World.</hi> The World is a Place full of Snares; There are Temptations, and Exerciſes, in every Condition, in every Relation and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. And Satan is a conſtant and reſtleſs Adverſary, who is full of Malice, &amp; watches all Opportunities ſeeking whom he may Devour, and tho' he can't Deſtroy yet he may and does greatly Afflict the People of GOD. He is often Aſſaulting &amp; Buffet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, ſometimes by Amazing Terrors, ſometimes by Helliſh Inſinuations, &amp; Horrid Suggeſtions, that are enough to fill the Soul with Trembling Agonies and Dreadful Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities. But now his Opportunities are over; he is ſhut out of that place where the Souls of Believers are carried. Now they Rejoyce as having Conquered, yea they Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in CHRIST, being made Partakers of his Conqueſt and Victory over Satan, &amp; the World. Beſides ſuch are more eſpecially expoſed to <hi>the Reproaches</hi> and <hi>Injuries of the Wicked.</hi> The ungodly World hates them becauſe of their Love to CHRIST and their Faithfulneſs to Him. But Death ſets them free from this alſo. I ſhall only add, They are here ſometimes exerciſed <hi>with ſad Deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
                  <pb n="13" facs="unknown:003122_0008_0FF002574AD5A2C8"/>
and Heart <hi>oppreſſing Fears,</hi> about <hi>their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the Covenant of GOD</hi> and the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of Heaven. Many Dark Days paſs over them in this State, wherein ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints are over heard from them as in Pſal. XIII. at the beginning, <hi>How long will thou forget me, O LORD, for Ever? How long wilt thou hide thy Face from me? How long ſhall I take Counſel in my Soul, having Sorrow in my Heart daily</hi>? But now they are wholly delivered from theſe Exerciſes, they are no longer at a State of diſtance from, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with the LORD. Now their Souls Rejoyce in His Salvation, now they Sing unto the LORD becauſe He has dealt boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully with them. <hi>This is the Exchange,</hi> Death makes for, and in a Believer, then ſurely he is no Loſer by it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. DEATH is Gain to Believers, in that <hi>they then enter upon the Enjoyment of all Good.</hi> All Tears are then Wiped away from their Eyes, and they Drink of the Fulneſs of Joy. <hi>They Hunger no more, nor Thirſt any more, nor ſhall the Sun light on them, nor any Heat. For the LAMB which is in the midst of the Throne ſhall Feed them, and ſhall Lead them unto Living Fountains of Waters.</hi> Rev. VII. 16.17.</p>

For this they will be Compleatly framed and fitted, by the clear Manifeſtations of the Glorious Perfections of the Divine Nature unto them, whereby they ſhall be Compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Perfectly Transformed into the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Likeneſs. They had ſome Knowlege of the Divine Glories before, but yet ſmall Comparitively to what then they ſhall have. Tis but a very ſmall Portion the beſt know of GOD in this World: Now much Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is in them, how Dull and Slow of Heart to Believe? What little underſtanding of the Glory that ſhall be hereafter Revealed? They Sigh &amp; Mourn under their Ignorance in this bodily State, and earneſtly Groan for farther Diſcoveries of the Divine Glory to them. But as ſoon as the Believers Soul is Releaſed from the Body, the Bleſſed Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that long Deſired Day is riſen upon it, it comes forth from all its Darkneſs, and the Glory of GOD is riſen upon it. He will then enable it to behold his Glory in ſuch a meaſure, as in its Conjunct State with the Body could not be Born, without a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the Vital Bonds. It will then be made to <hi>See HIM that is Inviſible,</hi> and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the Inacceſſible Light Tis not
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:003122_0009_0FF00259EF485308"/>
Compatible to the Nature of the Creature, to have a Comprehenſive knowledge of GOD, as that means the Infinite Extent (if I may ſo ſpeak) of his Perfections; yet a Perfect one it may be ſaid to have, as that means juſt and agreable to the Object, and the Capacity of the Subject The under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding will then take in a diſcovery of the Divine Glory equally. It will be much more enabled to diſcern the Divine Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies together, to have a fuller Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and more Adequate Conceptions of GOD. For ſays the Apoſtle <hi>We ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi> And then, <hi>the ſight of this Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhall Compleatly Transform it,</hi> make the Soul perfectly Holy. Tis the beholding the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Glory, that impreſſes the likeneſs of GOD upon the Soul. Tis a ſight of the Glory of GOD that firſt changed it in its Converſion, and made it Conformable to Him. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> III. 18. Now this work of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs is but begun in this Life, and carried on according to the diſcoveries GOD gives of Himſelf to the Soul. But this is not Perfected here. When we ſee and know better, then we ſhall become better. <hi>When He appears we ſhall be like him,</hi> the Apoſtle ſays, becauſe <hi>we ſhall then ſee him as he is.</hi> We ſhall then <hi>be Holy</hi> as <hi>He is Holy.</hi> There will be no more any Law of the Members warring

againſt the Law of the Mind, no remaining Blindneſs of Mind, no Error of Judgment, no Irregularity of Affections; all Clouds, Darkneſs and Diſorder are Chaſed out of the Soul for Ever by the Beaming forth of the Divine Glory upon it. Then is the <hi>New Creature Arrived to the Meaſure of the Stature of a Perfect Man in CHRIST JESUS.</hi> And then is the Soul arrived to the Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of its Happineſs. It is then filled with GOD, the pourings out of His Love and Goodneſs, and is carried out to Him in the higheſt delight and ſatisfaction, as its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and Adequate Reſt. It has then Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that State of Exiſtence that is proper for the Nature of ſuch a Being, higher than <hi>which</hi> it is not Capable of and beyond <hi>which</hi> it can't Deſire. Pſal. XVII. 15. <hi>As for me, I will behold thy Face in Righteouſneſs: I ſhall be Satisfied, when I awake with thy Likeneſs.</hi> GOD is enough to fill the Soul with Ineffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Delight, and He will be the Everlaſting Fountain thereof unto it. <hi>In His Preſence it will Eternally find, fulneſs of Joy,</hi> Pſal. XVI. 11. It ſhall then <hi>behold the Face of the FATHER,</hi> Mat. XVIII. 10 And have a full View and Fruition of His Love.

that they might Live; And that Eternal Love that ſingled them out of the corrupt Maſs of the World, and choſe them to be the Subjects of his Everlaſting Favour and Love. And Love and Praiſe, will be the ceaſeleſs returns they make for that won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Love of the Father in making them His Sons 1 <hi>John</hi> III. 1. Then alſo they ſhall ſee the <hi>SON</hi> the <hi>LORD JESUS CHRIST,</hi> who is Man as well as GOD, and have immediate Communion with Him. He is gone before them to prepare a Place for them, and this is His good Pleaſure that they ſhall <hi>be with Him where He is, to behold His Glory,</hi> Joh. XVII. 24. Here they have Fellowſhip with him in his Death and the Power of his Reſurrection, but then they ſhall <hi>ſee him as he is,</hi> 1 Joh. III. 2. It was a great Priviledge the Apoſtles had to Live with CHRIST on Earth; tho' he was Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and his Glory Veiled, in a great Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: But how much more delightful to be with Him in a Glorified State in Heaven? When the Apoſtles had but a Glympſe of this in His Transfiguration, Peter cries out <hi>it is good for us to be here,</hi> Mat. XVII. 4. But how much better is it to be with Him for Ever in Heaven, where He ſhall always ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the Brightneſs of His Glory; and ſatisfy <hi>them</hi> with His Love, whom He Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:003122_0011_0FF0025E3ABE1600"/>
by His Death? So alſo they ſhall <hi>have Fellowſhip with the Holy Spirit.</hi> They have Communion here with the <hi>Spirit</hi> in His Sanctifying, Quickning and Comforting Preſence, but then in a more full and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Manner; They ſhall be <hi>filled with all the fulneſs thereof,</hi> with the Perfection of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Grace, with Knowledge, and Wiſdom, and every Gift ſuitable for the Converſes and Employments of the Heavenly World; with that Comfort and Conſolation, <hi>that Peace and Joy that paſſes all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding.</hi>

THIS may ſhew us <hi>the great difference there is between Chriſtleſs Perſons and others.</hi> Death is Gain to thoſe, to whom to Live is CHRIST, in ſeveral reſpects as we have ſeen, but to Chriſtleſs Perſons Death proves the Reverſe, even the greateſt loſs Imaginable, and brings with it the greateſt Miſery. Here they have their Good things, but hereafter their Evil things; and Hence, while others are Comforted they are Tormented. To awaken ſuch, and to excite their endeavours to get out of that miſerable Condition where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are, Let them Conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">(1) <hi>THAT at Death they looſe all their Worldly Comforts, and whatever was Service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to them while they Lived.</hi> They have here many Mercies in common with others; many times as to the Gifts of Providence, they have as great a Share as any in the World, yea oftentimes a Greater. The Pſalmiſt obſerves, Pſal. LXXIII. 7. <hi>That they have the Waters of a full Cup wrung out to them, that they have as much as Heart can wiſh.</hi> But whatever their Poſſeſſions and Comforts are while they Live, Death brings a Writ of Ejection againſt them, their Houſes and Lands paſs to other Owners, they are <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

in the Duſt. Whatever great deſigns they had, to raiſe their Names or Families, they are all Daſhed; <hi>In that Day all their thoughts Periſh.</hi> They looſe all their Friends and Acquaintance; all the Comfort they had in them, and delight they took in Converſing with them is at an End. As to his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Man there is nothing but loſs, yea loſs of all things.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) <hi>THE Chriſtleſs Sinner at Death looſes all his Hopes.</hi> While he Lived, he often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Bleſſed his Soul, and Flattered himſelf with Hopes of going to Heaven when he left the World. There are many Carnal Confidences they are apt to Cheriſh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their Priviledges, Profeſſion, Viſible Relation to the People of GOD, Religious Duties they carried on, and ſome Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Strictneſs in their Lives, and Uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to the Publick But when Death Seiſes upon them all their Hopes are Daſhed and at an End. Job VIII. 13, 14. <hi>The Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites Hope ſhall Periſh, whoſe Hope ſhall be cut off, and whoſe Truſt ſhall be a Spiders Web.</hi> Their Hopes will leave them aſhamed, and they will find to their Everlaſting Confuſion, that they had only been Flattering and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Cheat upon their Souls.

in their Souls, that would qualify them for a State of Bleſſedneſs; and then they will find thoſe things they built their Confiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces upon, will be Rejected. All they did in Religion will come to nothing, being done from a Carnal Principle, and to a Carnal End; every thing will be looked upon as ſo many Provocations to GOD, as <hi>Prov.</hi> XV. 8. <hi>Iſa</hi> LXVI. 3.

               <p n="3">(3) A Chriſtleſs Sinner at <hi>Death looſes all his Opportunities to get a Change in his Condition.</hi> It is a Terrible time with a Sinner in this World when his Eyes are opened, and his Sins are ſet in order before him, and he ſees the Wrath of GOD Impending him, &amp; all his Falſe Confidences ſtruck out of his Hand He is as it were upon the Borders of Hell, and Terrors take hold on him. But tho' it be Sad, yet this is ſome Mitigation of it that there is hope his Condition may be altered. He yet enjoys a Day of Patience and Probation. GOD is waiting to be Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, there is a Poſſibility of a Change tho' it be Hazardous and Uncertain. But now
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:003122_0013_0FF002634A4D8AF0"/>
in the caſe before us, this is the Aggravation of it that the Day of Patience is at an End. Such are gone away from all Opportunities of Repenting and Returning to GOD. <hi>The Maſter of the Houſe has riſen and ſhut to the Door.</hi> They have no more offers of Mercy, no more calls to Repentance. Time was when GOD did Invite, yea by His Miniſters did Intreat Sinners to be Reconciled to Him; who have uſed all Perſwaſions &amp; Arguments they could, but they turned a Deaf Ear to all their Intreaties, and now Repentance is hid from the Eyes of their Judge, as before it was from then. The things of their Peace are Everlaſtingly hid from their Eyes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they knew them not in the Day of their Viſitation. Now no Cries or Intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties will be regarded; CHRIST has ſhut his Heart againſt them, and will be Favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to them no more. As in <hi>Prov.</hi> I. 24. — How much ſoever the Seaſons of Grace are undervalued now, the loſs of them at that Day will be eſteemed an Inſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Miſery.</p>
               <p n="4">(4) <hi>THEN their Souls are for Ever Loſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> You Read <hi>Mat.</hi> XVI. 26. of the Loſs of the Soul, that it is the Sum of all other Loſſes, and Miſeries that can be thought of. For this conſiſts not in the Death or Annihilation
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:003122_0014_0FF0026635559080"/>
of it; for GOD has made it Immortal, it ſhall never Die. But it conſiſts in an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſeparation from GOD, and Baniſhment from His Gracious Preſence, (in the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of which the Bleſſedneſs of the Soul does conſiſt) and in the Eternal Senſe and Impreſſion of GOD's Fearful, and Fiery Wrath and Indignation: They are Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced as Accurſed Creatures, to Depart into Everlaſting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels. <hi>Where the Worm never Dies, and the Fire is never Quenched,</hi> Mat. XXV. 41. Mark IX. 44. They looſe at this Hour all that was neceſſary to their Souls Felicity. All Hopes of ever ſeeing and enjoying GOD and CHRIST and Heaven for Ever. Who can conceive the Miſery of ſuch a Loſs, or apprehend the Dreadfulneſs of it! This is the dreadful Cataſtrophe of a Chriſtleſs Sinner! Now he ſlights the beſt Good, &amp; ſets his Heart and Affections upon Periſhing Delights, and hereafter, he will looſe all Good, yea his very Soul, and all the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it is capable of, and inſtead of any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light &amp; Comfort, be confined to Everlaſting Horrors &amp; Lamentations. How Infinitely does it concern them to Awake out of their Sleep, &amp; never be at Reſt till they ſhall have obtained a Spiritual Life from CHRIST, that ſo all theſe Evils may be Prevented?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="unknown:003122_0014_0FF0026635559080"/>2. THIS may Inſtruct us <hi>Not to paſs a wrong Judgment upon the Death of the Godly, nor to count them <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nhappy in their Departure, and the charge that is made, in their Condition at Death.</hi> The Death of ſuch is a great loſs to the Living, but of unſpeakable Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to them. The Mention of which leads our Thoughts to, &amp; makes our Tears ſpring a freſh at our Loſs, in the Death of <hi>Your late very</hi> EXCELLENT PASTOR, of whom moſt true was it, <hi>That to him to Live was CHRIST, and to him therefore Death has been Gain</hi> He is now Reaping, and Eternally will do ſo, the Advantage of Living to CHRIST. To whoſe Memory we can't but be bound to pay a Tribute, by Publickly Bewailing the Loſs Suſtained in his Death, and Exhibiting a juſt account of his Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Example, to Incite the Living to an Imitation, and for the Honour of CHRIST his Grace, and His Servant too. This is doubtleſs acceptable to CHRIST, to give Him the Honour of his Graces in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed Servant, and for us alſo to Remember Him with Honour, who has made is his Buſineſs to put Honour upon CHRIST.

But ſuitably to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit the Excellencies of this Eminent Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of CHRIST, I am very ſenſible of my Unskilfulneſs, and might any Arguments have been admitted for my Excuſe, I had been among the Silent, as I am among the deepeſt Mourners, where my Affection, and Senſe of his Excelling worth carry me, and make me Earneſtly wiſh for a better Hand to Embalm his Precious Memory.</p>
               <p>THE Subject is High and Large, and which way ſoever we take a View of him, we ſhall find uncommon Excellencies, and not a little for our Admiration and Imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>WHAT of him firſt took our Thoughts, was his Comely, Serene and Majeſtick Aſpect, his Pleaſant, yet Grave and Solemn Deportment, every way becoming the great Excellencies of his Mind, always Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding our Reverence, and Attracting our Love. Moſt Happy was he in a Meek, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, Peaceable and Pleaſant Diſpoſition. He Excelled in a peculiar Sweetneſs and Goodneſs of Temper, and in a Beneficent Love to Mankind. This his Love moſt Diffuſive, tho' eſpecially directed to ſuch where the Chriſtian appeared, yet led him to do Good to all, &amp; to the greateſt diſtance

from ſpeaking Evil of any. He was Hearty and Real in his Affection to his Friend, Faithful to his Intereſt, Obliging and Sincere in the Expreſſions of his Friendſhip, and wholly Unpractiſed in the Arts of Diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
               <p>AND as he was by Nature of a Placid, Patient and Meek Spirit, ſo he was by Grace much more ſo. His Mind was poſſeſſed of a conſtant Serenity, and his Breaſt with a Steady and Uninterrupted Calm, which ſeemed wholly a Stranger to the Diſorders of Paſſion. The Heavenly Dew which falls not in a Storm, ever falling upon his Soul, always Calm and Serene with the Meekeſt Patience. That Wiſdom was Eminently diſcovered in him, which is from above, <hi>which is firſt Pure, then Peaceable, Gentle and Eaſy to be entreated, full of Mercy and good Fruits, without Partiality, and without Hypocriſy,</hi> James III. 17.</p>
               <p>SUCH <hi>an Humility</hi> was always his Cloathing, as diſcovered his Relation as a Diſciple to the Lowly JESUS. His Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, his Behaviour, whatever he did, was moſt Remote from Pride, and ſpake pure Humility. Whoever ſaw any thing in him Savouring of Oſtentation, or ever Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the leaſt Envy to have had a Room
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:003122_0016_0FF0026B28B52480"/>
in his Heart? He had learned of CHRIST to be Meek and Lowly, and to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of no Reputation, nor ſeek the Honour that is of Man. He was truly a Man of Prayer, being much with GOD in that Duty, and the ſucceſſes upon Special concerns, of his quiet Waitings, and mighty Wreſtlings with GOD were ſometimes too Remarkable not to be obſerved, and improved as En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements to keep alive that Spirit of Faith and Prayer that was ſo Eminent in him.</p>
               <p>AND if we follow him into his Houſe we find a Generous, Kind and Obliging Hoſpitality, we there ſee the Tender and Dear Husband, the Careful and Loving Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Wiſe Governour of his Houſhold, where nothing Indecent or Extravagant could find a Room, making <hi>his Houſe a Bethel</hi> by the conſtant and exact maintaining the Worſhip of GOD in it, and a School of Piety, in the Religious Education of all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his care. Therein approving himſelf a true Child of <hi>Abraham, Commanding his Children and Houſehold after him to Serve the LORD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IF we Conſider him in his Publick Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, we there ſee the true Evangelical Paſtor. His Abilities &amp; Learning were beyond what were imagined by the moſt, (his great Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:003122_0016_0FF0026B28B52480"/>
being a Veil to thoſe Excellencies) which being attended with the Fire of Goodneſs in an Eminent Degree, he appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved himſelf a Burning and Shining Light in this Golden Candleſtick. And in whoſe Light GOD has Vouchſafed you many Years to Rejoyce.</p>
               <p>HE Lived always as under the Eye and Awe of the Great GOD, to whom he was to give account of the Great Charge com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him; and Laboured therein as one Abſolutely Devoted to the Service and Intereſt of CHRIST. He underſtood his Work and had a Lively ſenſe of the Worth of Souls; and the bringing Glory to GOD, in being an Inſtrument to Promote the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sinners by CHRIST, was his chief his only Ambition, and this Swallowed up all his Thoughts and Talents. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of Sinners was the Great thing he aimed at, he was moved with Compaſſion for them in their Miſery, and Laboured their Awakening, to Shoot his Arrows into their Hearts <hi>and Effect a Trembling Senſe of their being in the Gall of Bitterneſs, and Bonds of Iniquity,</hi> having no part in the Pardon of their Sins, or the Hopes of Glory, and a <hi>thorough Humiliation</hi> of Soul before GOD; that they might be prepared for the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:003122_0017_0FF0026DCCCD2D08"/>
of the Truth, if GOD Peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would open their Eyes to ſee his Glory in the Face of His SON, and give them Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to the acknowledging of it, <hi>that they might eſcape out of the Snares of the Devil, who are taken Captive by him at his will,</hi> 2 Tim. II. 25</p>
               <p>HOW Tender and Affectionate was his concern for the Children of the Covenant, <hi>the Lambs of his Flock,</hi> (which he always Eyed as a great part of his Charge.) How warm &amp; conſtant his Endeavours that they might not be Loſt, both his Publick and Private Inſtructions and Applications to them are Witneſſes. Careful and Diligent was he as a good Shepherd, <hi>to know the State of his Flock, and look well to all the parts of it,</hi> to give to every one his Meat in due Seaſon. Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to Obſerve, and Prudent in Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dating himſelf to the Temptations, Diſtreſſes, Afflictions &amp; Duties of all under his Charge. In directing the Enquirers of the way to Zion, Encouraging the Faint Hearted, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting the Diſconſolate, and Setling the Peace of the Souls of his People on Sure grounds, Helping under Temptations, Strengthening the Weak, Encouraging the Humble, Endeavouring all he might to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the Saints, that they might be Strong in the LORD, and fitted for their Maſter's uſe.
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:003122_0017_0FF0026DCCCD2D08"/>
HE Managed his Miniſtry with Faithfulneſs and Wiſdom, purely for GOD, and the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Souls of his People. His Preaching was Plain, and ſuited to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign he had always in view, the Convincing, Humbling, and Converting Sinners, Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Faith, Love and Holineſs in his Hearers. And agreably to this great deſign in his view, to Save himſelf and others, to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſh the Kingdom of Satan, and ſet up the Kingdom of CHRIST, attain himſelf the Kingdom of Glory, and help others to it, he Laboured with all his might, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to <hi>Encounter Principalities and Powers,</hi> the Strength of Hell, and the Luſts of the Hearts of Men, which Baffle all means but what are in the Hand of the Spirit; and therefore under a ſenſe that means were Powerful and Effectual through GOD; He maintained a believing Dependance upon CHRIST, and had ever Recourſe to the LORD that ſent him; &amp; the Succeſs which GOD has Graciouſly given to the Labours of this His Faithful, Humble and Diligent Servant, has been beyond what many Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters do ever Experiences Many and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py are the Fruits GOD has Graciouſly given to the Travail of his Soul. And this may be reckoned among not the leaſt Succeſſes of his Conduct in the Miniſtry, That <hi>Peace</hi>

has by GOD's Bleſſing <hi>upon his Wiſdom and Meekneſs,</hi> been preſerved among his People, notwithſtanding many Temptations unto Difference that have been amongſt them. And as he was ever Studious of the Unity and Peace of the Church, over which the HOLY GHOST had made him an Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeer, ſo he was ever Studious of Union and Communion, with thoſe that were Fellow Labourers with him in the like Work, for the Proſperity of the whole, and the Enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Kingdom of CHRIST; and without Partiality it may be ſaid, he has been unto them a Pattern of Humility, and Prudence, Meekneſs, Love and Ardent Zeal for the Glory of CHRIST. Nor may be forgotten his Faithful and Eminent Services, for the School of the Prophets, (having for many Years been Improved as one of the Truſtees of YALE COLLEGE) which accounted it no ſmall part of their Glory and Safety that he ſtood in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of a Father to it, and employed his Wiſdom, Care and Love for the Flouriſhing of it.</p>
               <p>HE Adorned every Station wherein he was ſet, and in every Capacity Reflected ſuch an Honour upon Chriſtianity, that without Flattery it may be ſaid, he was
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:003122_0018_0FF00270419C9900"/>
one of the Brighteſt Examples of it, that this Age has Produced.</p>
               <p>AND thus in Serving GOD with Entire Devotedneſs and Reſignation, in Simplicity and Godly Sincerity, not with Fleſhly Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, did his laſt Sickneſs find him, (not without having had a ſtrong Impreſſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Spirit ſometime before, that his Work was almoſt Finiſhed) which he endured with Patience and the greateſt Reſignation; during all which (while he was Favoured with the Regular exerciſe of his Rational Powers) a Divine Calm, and Peaceful Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renity filled his Soul. Expecting it would prove as it has done, the End of his Labours, and an Inlet into his Maſter's Joy. By Faith he looked over the Dark Valley, and <hi>ſaw the Crown of Righteouſneſs, which GOD the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Judge</hi> does give <hi>to them that Fight a good Fight, and Finiſh their Courſe with Faith.</hi> And as the Apoſtle, ſo he has Unqueſtionably found, <hi>that as to him to Live was CHRIST, ſo Death has proved Infinitely Gainful.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. WE here ſee <hi>there is a Conſolation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to thoſe that are looking after Godly Friends with Tears and Sorrows.</hi> To take Notice of the Hand of GOD in their Removal, and to Mourn our own, and the Publick's Loſs,

is our Duty. But here a Comfortable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection is Adminiſtred to us, that the Change they have made is Unſpeakably to their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. As it was matter of Thankfulneſs that we enjoyed ſuch Friends, where <hi>GOD by his Spirit had drawn his Image and prepared for an Inheritance among the Saints in Light.</hi> A Favour which it muſt be Confeſſed, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them more deſireable, and much greater Bleſſings; yet it yields no ſmall Conſolation to think how happily for them, GOD has ordered their State. That the place they live in is more Deſireable, their Enjoyments and Comforts more Satisfying than ever before. Death brings them to the Place and Happineſs they Prayed Believed and Hoped to enjoy. It puts an End to all their Burthens, Fears and Temptations, it turns their Sorrow into Joy. They were here ſo long as it pleaſed GOD they ſhould be, and no longer is it fit they ſhould be with us; which ought to quiet us with Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their Removal from us. But it ought to be matter of no ſmall Conſolation to us, that GOD has taken them from all Sorrows and ſatisfies them immediately with Himſelf. Their Death has not parted them from their Happineſs, tho' it has parted them from their Neareſt &amp; Deareſt Friends, yea has cut aſunder the Union between

Body and Soul, but it has not Diſſolved the Union between them and CHRIST; hence in <hi>Rom.</hi> VIII. 38 Death is put into the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle's Triumph, — <hi>Neither Death, nor Life,</hi> &amp;c <hi>can ſeparate us from the Love of GOD which is in CHRIST JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S our LORD:</hi> Here then is matter of Conſolation to the Relatives of this Deceaſed Servant of the LORD, whoſe Death we Deplore. His Death is your Loſs, an unſpeakable Loſs to us all, and Stupid muſt we be if ſuch an Afflictive Providence coſt us not Tears of Grief. But not the Leaſt Groan is due on account of any Diſadvantage he has Suſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But you may Comfort your minds with the thoughts that a Dear Husband, a Loving Father is gone before you from a World of Sin and Sorrow, to Inherit a Crown prepared for him before the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the World.

What reaſon have you to Bewail the loſs of the moſt likely means for your Salvation? Do you expect better than you have loſt, or can you think leſs Likely and ſmaller Remedies will prove Healing to you, when the more Hopeful and Greater have Effected Nothing? Is it not Awful to you to think that all his Sermons, Prayers, Tears, and Heavenly Life, will Riſe up in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt you? And that he who has been Intreating for your Souls, and Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately beſeeching you to be Reconciled to GOD, will be a Witneſs againſt you, to your GREAT JUDGE, to whom he is gone to give an account of his Charge?
