            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AS this little peice may be read by ſome, who know not the Author, nor his ſituation at Lebanon, it may be needful to ſay a few things reſpecting both.</p>
            <p>I had been regularly called to preach in this Society as a Candidate for ſettlement, in the place of my late venerable Grand-Father. After ſome time the Society by a majority of a little more than two thirds, invited me to ſettle with them as their Paſtor, in which the Church almoſt unanimouſly concurred. On conſideration whereof, together with the earneſt Deſire of my kind Friends, and my affection for them and the people, and by the advice of other wiſe and judicious Perſons, I tho't it my duty to except the call of ſo great a Majority. Some further time being elapſed, and the good people who were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my Settlement, continuing to oppoſe themſelves to it, (which in the opinion of many was not to have been expected; the aſpect of publick affairs being difficult, and having a mind diſpoſed for perfect peace and harmony;) I wiſhed to be releaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from my obligations, hoping the Society would be better united in ſome better man, and accordingly requeſted it of them. But ſuch was the unmerited attachment of my worthy and dear Friends, that they could not be perſuaded to conſent. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards a Council of Rev. Miniſters was at my requeſt agreed upon and called to adviſe all the concerned; who were kind enough to attend and conſider the matter, and agreed upon the reſult which is ſubjoined.</p>
            <p>Being about to leave the Society in conſequence of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, the following Sermon was delivered. It was compoſed under more than uſual diſadvantages, while I was not maſter of my own (ſhort) time, and without the leaſt thought of its ever being printed. But unexpectedly, repeated applications have been made to me for a Copy; I have conſented; not with the leaſt wiſh of commencing Author, or being known to the

learned world, but to gratify my worthy Friends, who it ſeems wiſhed for ſome viſible token of their kind remembrance, and to convince me that to the laſt their affection continued with unabated ſtrength. And ſhould it contribute to the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid comfort or final Salvation of one Soul, how great would be my reward? The critick may if he pleaſe make many ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations on the inaccuracy of the compoſition, the harſhneſs or flatneſs of the Periods &amp;c. But let it be remembered that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction is a much greater object, than mere entertainment; and that the beauties of Style have no peculiar reliſh, nor do they form any eſſential, or even needful part in the Chriſtian Character. It is not the elegance and purity of religious compoſition, which inſtructs and refreſhes good people, but the plainneſs and importance of the truths that are held up to view. The truths of the Bible are the ſweeteſt Food of religious contemplative minds. If we would be uſeful we ſhould <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

Had I affected it, tis poſſible I might have dreſſed the diſcourſe in a politer Garb, but an eligant Style or handſome peice of compoſition will carry no body to Heaven, nor qualify for it. Let none collect hence that I wiſh to diſcourage the ſtudy of language and compoſition, far from it. But would only inſinuate that a love for accuracy with ſome, almoſt ſwallows up objects of unſpeakably greater moment. It is alſo, one thing to gaze at a Preacher, admire and be carried away with the ſound and ſweetneſs of his Voice, the ingenuity of his remarks, and ſmoothneſs of his periods, and a very different one, by a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous attention, with a mixture of Faith, to endeavour to get profit by the word preached, and to be led into the knowledge and practice of Soul intereſting Truths. To know Jeſus Chriſt and him crucified, the ſovereign Phyſician of ſin ſick

ſouls, is infinitely the moſt important knowledge, and to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him to the underſtanding and affections of mankind, in that and all his amiable and glorious Characters, and in a language ſimple and plain, ſtrong and forceable, like that of the ſacred Scriptures, highly becomes every one who would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove himſelf, a pungent inſtructive and practical preacher of his Goſpel—</p>

The next day the Council proceeded to a full hearing of all matters relative to the difficulties aforeſaid; as laid before them by the Church and Society Committee and the aggreived Brethren; and found the oppoſition to the ſettlement of Mr. Williams ſo great, and attended with ſo many unfavourable proſpects of uſefulneſs and comfort, as to render it, in our opinion inexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient. Therefore on mature deliberation, the Council unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly adviſe the Church and Society to acquieſce in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of Mr. Williams, to be releaſed from his obligations to them by an acceptance of their call, ſignified in his memorial laid before them in Society Meeting September <hi>22</hi>d, <hi>1777.</hi> We rejoice that Mr. Williams's moral and religious Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

ſtands entirely unimpeached, and heartily wiſh he may be greatly uſeful and happy, where ever he may be called in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to labor, in perſuing the important work to which he has devoted himſelf—At the ſame time we are truly ſenſible that Mr. Williams leaving this Society in circumſtances of ſo much danger and temptation muſt be peculiarly trying, to a very great part of this Church and People, who juſtly eſteem him as poſſeſſing thoſe amiable qualifications and endowments which lay a foundation of his doing eminent ſervice for Chriſt, where ever God ſhall make room for his improvement: Yet we truſt the peculiar and complicated difficulties, that would attend his ſettling in this place will diſpoſe them to ſubmit to to the diſpenſation; intimated in providence, as we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend to be the will of God.—</p>
            <p>Brethren of this Church and Society, we earneſtly wiſh and pray you may be impreſſed with a deep ſenſe, that the holy hand of God is upon you, and be led rightly to improve his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous correction: by putting away all bitterneſs and wrath, and ſeeking divine direction in thoſe meaſures which may conduce to a happy reſettlemn of the Goſpel miniſtry among you—and that ſtudying the things which make for peace and the edification of one another in love; the God of love and peace may delight to dwell with and bleſs you.—</p>

            <p>I think it is an obſervation that will hold throughout, that Chriſt ever uſed the eaſieſt and happieſt methods to inſtruct his hearers. He ſcarcely failed of opening and illuſtrating the moſt important truths by things drawn from common life, and within every ones reach and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance. He did not need to be let into our ſlowneſs of underſtanding, into our miſapprehenſions and prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, into our ſpiritual blindneſs and darkneſs, He, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, knew the need of the plaineſt preaching. He knew that what was not underſtood, could not be rationally loved nor practiſed.—He came to inſtruct the ignorant, to enlighten the blind, to guide the doubting, and ſtrengthen the weak. With this great deſign ever full in his view, he accommodated himſelf, in his private converſation and public preaching, to the circumſtances and capacities of all—He adapted himſelf to the weakeſt and meaneſt mind. He ſpoke for God to man. He ſpoke to dying and immortal creatures. He ſpoke from the moſt benevolent heart—Chriſt was a poor weak man's preacher—He that was to teach mankind muſt uſe a plain familiar method; or he would never ſucceed. A ſchool maſter, for ſuch was Chriſt, and ſuch were his Apoſtles, begins with the eaſieſt leſſons, and talk in ſuch a ſtrain, as that the tender pupil takes it in by little and little, and gradually goes forward, when under proper

care, adding one improvement to another: Beginning, (in the metaphorical language of the bible,) with milk, and ending in ſtrong meat ſuited to a robuſt conſtitution: ſuited, (to drop the Metaphor,) to an enlarged well grown capacity. A public teacher, as Chriſt was, ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways endeavour to get, while he avoids vulgariſm's, the plaineſt ſtyle, the moſt obvious and ſtriking thoughts, and the ſimpleſt connection between his ideas. He ſhould open it with ſuch eaſe, that all may ſee it; and apply it in ſuch a manner, if poſſible, that all may feel it and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by it—It ſhould run in as clear, as conſtant and copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a ſtream as may be—His own heart ſhould ever burn with a love for it: his life ſhould exemplify it; and warm from his heart, it ſhould run thro' all his ſermons.—</p>
            <p>Not only did Chriſt uſe a familiar intelligible method in opening truth, but he dwelt upon the greateſt truths.—</p>
            <p>The fundamental articles of our faith and practice were the burden, the ſubſtance, the ground work of his preaching. Unprofitable nicities, trifling queſtions, learned pompous harangue made no part of his public teaching—In this, he is an excellent pattern—Nor is this all—His method was cloſe and pungent—Truth was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely dear to him—He was the truth—Truth itſelf o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal, eſſential eternal truth—His ſermons are filled with the moſt intereſting truths—He told all, as he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beſt, when opportunity offered, their true character and ſituation—He was not a courtier nor a fawning flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer—He did not ſeek applauſe and honor from crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures—He could never be prevailed upon to feed our va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, gratify a carnal heart, and build our hopes upon a falſe foundation—We are ever directed to the Rock of ages for comfort and ſupport—Every carnal confidence and creature truſt is a bed ſhorter than that a man can ſtretch himſelf on it, and a covering too narrow to wrap himſelf in it—Chriſt is a ſure foundation—Iſa—28—He
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:016172_0008_0F9BC9C02F1E06E8"/>
is an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempeſt—Iſa—32—He is the only way, the truth and the life—John 14—He ever labored to divert their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and withdraw their hearts from every thing elſe. Momentous truths he repeatedly and abundantly explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, inculcated and inforced—Hence this may be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, that the plaineſt, moſt pungent and practical ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons are the beſt—The man, that preaches plain profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able truths, in a cloſe pungent manner, preaches like Chriſt, and is the moſt deſirable preacher—Indeed gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral obſervation and our own feelings confirm this point, That he who ſquares his preaching by the polite taſte of the world, conſults the humours and darling ſentiments of mankind, pays greater difference, to capital characters than to God's authority, and is more concerned to obtain the good will of his hearers, than to inſtruct them, nouriſh them by truth, and build them up in the belief of the foundeſt doctrines—In one word, the man who loves o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's pockets and favors, better than their ſouls will be diſpiſed by all. Even the very worſt revere, and eſteem an honeſt faithful man—It is a character that will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand reſpect: And as much, if not more, in a Miniſter, than in any other man. That preaching, the leading ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and ſole tendency of which, is evidently, to get a name, to gratify curioſity, to lull people a ſleep when dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, and feed their native pride, will do ten thouſand times the miſchief, that it doth good. And here I know not how to paſs it by, that it is for the moſt part, very eaſy to diſcover ſuch kind of preaching— It is eaſy to ſee the preacher's carnality and thirſt for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe in his performances—It is happy that detection is ſo eaſy—Such preaching is what the bible, every where<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> condemns as pernicious to ſouls, more precious than mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of gold and ſilver—There is ſuch a proneneſs in nature to preach it ſelf rather than Chriſt, that the cloſeſt
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:016172_0009_0F9BC9C0D2FDF428"/>
examination of that heart, which is deceitful above all things, and deſperately wicked, is to the laſt degree need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful—In one word, the plaineſs of Chriſt's preaching, the important truths which he taught, not leſs than his abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant and unwearied labor are worthy of our imitation— A better copy than this we can never have—A more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect model of excellent preaching we muſt never expect— The original will not be exceeded nor equalled—The nearer we come to it, the better—But to attend to the text—The immediate occaſion of it ſeems to be this. The 9<hi>th ver.</hi> informs us of the call and converſion of <hi>Matthew</hi>; who was a <hi>publican,</hi> or a collector of taxes. This buſineſs opened a door for cruelty, oppreſſion and injuſtice—And the temptation, likely, proved too ſtrong for the moſt. We find that this ſort of officers was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally hated and diſpiſed. This <hi>Matthew</hi> was however, where he ſhould be; <hi>ſitting at the receit of cuſtom.</hi> It is always beſt to be where Providence calls us—where our proper buſineſs lies. Idleneſs expoſes to almoſt every ſin. But tho' this was his buſineſs, yet that was no inſupera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble bar in the way of his ſalvation. Chriſt calls him, and he comes—Almighty power accompanied the call. As in creation, ſo here. <hi>He ſpeaks, and it is done.</hi> When grace took poſſeſſion of his heart, he bid farewell to his poſt with all its profits. The charmes were gone. Oh how ſmall an object will grace make this world appear! How trifling its offer—How empty its pleaſures—How vain its honors—How ſhort lived its riches—when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the ſatisfying, ſolid and permanent poſſeſſion of eternity!—</p>
            <p>The <hi>next ver.</hi> ſeats our Saviour at a feaſt that was made by this young convert. Tho' he doth not menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it as of his own providing, another evangeliſt doth. The gueſts were chiefly publicans and ſinners. His diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, indeed, were preſent—They who love Chriſt, love

his diſciples. It is not ſaid that kings and rulers, the chief prieſts and doctors of the law were with him; wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon him, waſhing his feet, and anointing his head. Perſons cloathed with ſuch authority and dignity, did not often attend him but to blacken his character, diſcredit his preaching, and ruin his influence as a public teacher. <hi>Rulers and phyloſophers</hi> were diſguſted with the plaineſs, the ſimplicity and holineſs of his religion—<hi>Publicans and ſinners</hi> were round him—His name was <hi>Jeſus—He came to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt</hi>—Offence is at once given to the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> the moſt notable <hi>Jewiſh ſect—And when the Phariſees ſaw it, they ſaid unto his diſciples, Why eat<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

He expoſed the badneſs of their real characters, the emptineſs of their profeſſions, the carnality of their views, and the ſecret wickedneſs of their life. Hence they hated him: For who can bear ſuch cutting truths? Who can bear to have their inſide character, their retired ſentiments and hidden baſeneſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the view and deteſtation of every one? That perſon muſt be a profound ſtranger to his own heart, who doth not know, that he will not bear to ſee himſelf in his native deformity ſtript of every diſguiſe—It is a very ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and delicate matter to tell others their faults without giving offence—It is well known, how often truth cuts to the quick—It needs a maſterly hand to do it to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.—To return—Theſe <hi>Phariſees</hi> did not deſire to ſee any around him, receiving inſtruction. They care no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing about him, and as little about <hi>publicans and ſinners.</hi> This queſtion is put either thro' envy, malice or ſpite— Wiſhing to injure him if they could. For they ſeized e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

opportunity to do it, and converted every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his life into an objection againſt him. There is, in the queſtion, a ſeeming tenderneſs for Chriſt's charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter—But it covered the wickedneſs of their hearts— Chriſt heared it, and prevents an anſwer from his diſciples: who might be unable to make a ſuitable reply and wipe off the reproach that was thrown upon their Maſter. The reply and anſwer is our text—<hi>They that be whole need not a phyſician, but they that are ſick</hi>—</p>
            <p>As tho' he had ſaid.
<q>Why do you quarrel with me on this account. You ſee what I am ever upon. I am always doing good either to the ſouls or bodies of men, or to both. My works on every ſide ſpeak forth the goodneſs of my heart—But beſides, you do not love my company. You will not hearken to my inſtructions. You reſiſt the evidence of my miracles. You have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed me from the beginning. You ſtill retain the ſame temper. You do not rejoice at my coming into the world upon the moſt benevolent deſign, nor do you welcome me into your houſes. And the reaſon is plain. You are they that juſtify yourſelves. You ſee no need of a Saviour. You think that you are good enough. You have no guilt to be removed. No na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be waſhed in my blood. Your apprehenſions of religious ſubjects are ſpiritual. Your will is pliable. Your affections are under the happy government of reaſon and religion. All within is as it ought to be. This is your opinion of yourſelves. No wonder then, that you do not look elſewhere, to me, and to heaven for help. Pray why ſhould you, when your own ſtrength, wiſdom and goodneſs anſwers all neceſſary purpoſes? The man that enjoys good health, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors under no real nor imaginary indiſpoſition will not apply to a doctor, phyſic himſelf, and keep his bed. And if he knows that he feels very well, finds himſelf

ſtrong, able to travel, labor or do what he pleaſes, it will be a difficult matter to perſuade or reaſon him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a fit of ſickneſs: To bring him to believe that the <hi>dropſy,</hi> or <hi>pluricy,</hi> or the <hi>gout</hi> is fixed on him. To ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualiſe the ſimilitude, it is ſo with you.</q>
In what a familiar, ſtriking, and, one would think, unexceptionable manner, is an important truth opened and illuſtrated? It was a full anſwer to their objections and cavils. It was calculated to make them feel to whom it was ſpoken: and it ought to have opened their eyes, and turned their attention wholly upon themſelves. To forbear a longer introduction, we ſhall attend to theſe things from the text.</p>
            <p n="1">I. We ſhall firſt draw the character of ſin ſick ſinners, who feel their need of Chriſt the phyſician of ſouls.</p>
            <p n="2">II. We ſhall then ſhew whence it it that Chriſt is wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come only to perſons of ſuch a character.</p>
            <p n="3">III. In the 3d place, We ſhall deſcribe Chriſt under the character of the phyſician of ſouls.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. And laſtly apply the ſubject, as our time allows— To begin with the firſt,</p>
            <p n="1">I. The character of ſin ſick ſinners, who feel their need of Chriſt, the phyſician of ſouls—</p>
            <p>I ſay, who feel their need of Chriſt, becauſe all need him, as he is the only way to the Father. But all do not feel their need of him, and apply to him for healing— As we are about to draw the character of ſin ſick ſinners, who only welcome Chriſt to the throne in their hearts. We obſerve in the 1ſt place. That ſuch ſinners condemn themſelves for all their ſins. They ſee that the divine character, which they have hated, is incomparably glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. That the divine authority is infinitely reaſonable— that God's laws are holy, juſt and good—They feel the ſtrong obligations under which they have long lain to love God with all their heart, mind, and ſtrength: to obey God's laws continually thro' out, with a perfect heart:
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:016172_0013_0F9BC9CAB2011A08"/>
to adore the Saviour, and give him the uppermoſt room in their affections. They ſee that they have done in ten thouſands, yea, in numberleſs inſtances, what they ought not to have done. They ſee that months, and years, in one word, their paſt life, is little elſe or more than a blank in their exiſtence: that they have abuſed their mercies, miſimproved their privileges, trifled with concerns of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal moment, and loſt many precious counſels, warnings and reproofs. They ſee that ingratitude, diſaffection, rebellion, ſtupidity, and madneſs, are written and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtamped upon their heart and life. Let them look where they will, it is bad. They ſee that they have acted in an unreaſonable, unprovoked perverſe manner. They ſee that all their deſires, purpoſes and ends were wrong—Here, my hearers, is enough to condemn. It is all condemned. Heart and life are ſentenced and condemned. The more there is that opens to view: the more ſuch a ſinner knows of himſelf, the more particular will this condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation be. The ſooner a thing is traced to the ſource, the ſooner will it be adjudged and condemned. For if the fountain be corrupt, ſo will the ſtreams be. If the heart be bad, the life can't be good. The one is but the expreſſion, the opening, the letting out of the other. The action wholly ſeparate from the heart is nothing. No more virtuous nor vicious than the motion of a clock, the blowing of the wind, or the rollings of the ſea. The ſin ſick ſinner condemns vain thoughts, carnal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, retired luſts, as well as an immoral life. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns all that he did, without any love for God, and holy delight in duty. He views all that he has done as trifling, as empty ſhew, but the form of godlineſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any of the power, the ſpirit and beauty of it. He was all the time, when he had worked himſelf to the higheſt pitch of goodneſs, dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, a child of diſobedience, and an heir of wrath. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:016172_0014_0F9BC9CBD5531758"/>
his treatment of God, and Chriſt, and the Spirit: his treatment of goſpel offers, of the word, and the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it: his treatment of convictions. He condemns himſelf, that he has uſed both ſoul and body in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of ſin and ſatan: that he has loved this world ſo well; himſelf ſo well; his own religious performances ſo well: that he has done no more good; and, not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large here, that he has been ſuch an unprofitable fruitleſs creature under the plentiful cultivation of Providence, and the bleſſings of the ſanctuary—But this condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not only particular and univerſal, reaching to all within him, and all without him—but it is a chearful, and ſweet one—There is nothing forced in it. It is the ſpontanious unconſtrained working and exerciſe of the heart. I had almoſt ſaid neceſſary. And, indeed, it is true. For it is not a neceſſity that leſſons or deſtroys free agency. The perſon is ſo penetrated with the evil of his conduct, that he condemns it unavoidably, as well as freely and chearfully. It is an act in which the ſoul acquieſces, and with which it is pleaſed. It chooſes, it rejoices ſo to do. The view that it has of ſin, ſtrikes it with ſuch abhorrence, that the contrary act, that of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, would ſhock it beyond account. The beauty and fitneſs of this ſelf-condemning act, ſtrike it with irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible force. But again—It is a righteous condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on—The perſon ſees that it is a reaſonable, and a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thing to paſs the ſentence upon himſelf, and againſt himſelf. The rule by which he ſhould walk, is a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, a righteous, a perfect and unchangeable rule. Hence as he has not walked by it at all, his condemnation is perfectly juſt; and he ſees it to be ſo. We ſhould ever be pleaſed with a righteous ſentence, a righteous puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a righteous law. And we ſhall do it, when we are properly diſpoſed toward ſpiritual objects—Further, We ſhall not only condemn ourſelves, if we are heartily ſick of ſin, but we ſhall realiſe and feel the juſtice of God in condemning of us too.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:016172_0015_0F9BC9CC174B16C8"/>If God is our proper Sovereign, and we are under ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to do what he would have us: if all that God requires of us we ought to do, then, it is eaſy to ſee, if we do not yield a cordial obedience, we are criminal; and, if criminal, condemned. For the penalty follows diſobedience. <hi>He that believeth not, ſaith the</hi> goſpel, <hi>is condemned already. John</hi> 3.18. <hi>The wrath of God abideth on him—ver.</hi>—36—If he is condemned, the ſentence is juſt, the puniſhment is juſt, for the law is holy—In this light, is it viewed by ſuch a perſon. He ſees that God would be juſt in puniſhing of him with everlaſting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. In as much as ſin is an infinite evil. It is juſt, and he will ſee it. If he doth not, he muſt be unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the infinitude of divine eccellence—with the ſpotleſs rectitude, the wiſdom and goodneſs of God's goverment, and with the purity of God's laws. If I have done wrong, I can't ſee, why it is not as reaſonable that I ſhould blame myſelf, condemn myſelf, and acknowledge the juſtice of my puniſhment, as that I ſhould condemn another. The relation in which I ſtand to myſelf, in no ſhape alters the nature of the crime, nor the degree of criminality and baſeneſs. It is as bad for me to hate a good parent, a good magiſtrate, a good government, as for my brother, my neighbour, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>, or any one. I deſerve as much to be puniſhed as they, in this point of light. It is beyond diſpute, our ſinful attachments blind our eyes, and prevent a juſt judgment in our own caſe. I am fully ſenſible, that we can ſee a fault in another much ſooner than in ourſelves. We can ſee more aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating circumſtances attending of it—attending the ſame crime in another than in ourſelves. It is much eaſier to ſubſcribe to the juſtice of another's puniſhment than to my own—But then, it is not becauſe there is any impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, or injuſtice in my being puniſhed according to my deſerts—I may deſerve it as much as another—I may
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:016172_0016_0F9BC9CCD0C30018"/>
deſerve it much more than another—And why ſhould I not be pleaſed with it? I do not aſk whether bodily pain is pleaſant? Whether ſhame, diſgrace, and wretchedneſs are pleaſant things in themſelves. But this I aſk—Why ſhould I not be pleaſed with the exerciſe of juſtice? In ſeeing a good government maintained, a juſt penalty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted, and every vice diſcountenanced? If I have broken an indiſputably needful wiſe law, why ſhould I not be frowned upon as well as any other criminal—any tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent perſon, a ſtranger, or an obſcure mean perſon? And ſhould I not be puniſhed with as much ſeverity too, if my crime deſerves it? In point of juſtice, why ſhould not I? The queſtion is not whether it is prudent, or, upon the whole, beſt, in every inſtance, but whether the puniſhment is juſt. If it is juſt, then I am ſo far from being juſtified in complaining of it, that if I am properly diſpoſed, I ſhall be pleaſed with it—I would ſay further, that we may ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to a puniſhment, and, at the ſame time oppoſe it in our hearts to the utmoſt—There may be a forced ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, which doth not imply the leaſt degree of acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcence, and approbation. We may care nothing about the ſupport of good government and the execution of good laws—We may ſee no beauty in order, propriety and obedience—To apply theſe plain thoughts—The penalty which is inſeparably connected with diſobedience to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine laws, is a proper expreſſion of God's infinite and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable hatred of moral evil, and of the greatneſs of the evil—Hence a breach of his law at once expoſes us to the penalty—The penalty is as it ought to be. Why ſhould we not then be pleaſed that God neceſſarily fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hates ſin, and is unalterably determined to puniſh it in ſuch a wiſe and holy manner? And why ſhould we not be pleaſed with a diſplay of his infinite perfection in puniſhing diſobedience, ingratitude, ſtupidity in ourſelves, as well as in any other ſinner? It is agreed on all ſides,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:016172_0017_0F9BC9CDA9C2B068"/>
even by the greateſt ſavers of themſelves, that there is no change in the reaſon, and juſtice of the puniſhment, let the ſubject be whom it may.—</p>
            <p>But once more, The ſin ſick ſinner blames himſelf for all hiſ ſins—This, in deed, is rather a conſequence of what has been ſaid, and almoſt a repetition of it—However, I thought it might be well to pay a more particular attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to it—He ſees that he is altogether in fault. He has no diſpoſition to apologiſe, palliate and excuſe his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.—He does not wiſh to throw any blame upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.—Nor doth he worry his mind with the introduction of moral evil. Convinced of this, that the corruption of his nature, and the unreaſonable enmity of his carnal mind are the ſeparating wall between God and himſelf: Convinced of this, that his oppoſition to God's intereſt and glory, is his ſin, and abſolutely inexcuſable, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation is levelled at himſelf, and centers in himſelf. He does not attempt his own juſtification. He can form no plea for himſelf.—Hence we meet with ſuch paſſages— <hi>If we juſtify ourſelves, our own mouths ſhall condemn us: If we ſay that we are perfect, that alſo ſhall prove us perverſe. If he will contend with us, we cannot anſwer him for one of a thouſand—Job—</hi>9—<hi>And now, O our God, what ſhall we ſay after this, for we have forſaken thy commandments— Ezra</hi>—9—<hi>If thou ſhouldeſt lay righteouſneſs to the line—ſee Iſa.</hi> 28—<hi>Wherefore ſhould a living man complain, a man for the puniſhment of his ſins—Lam.</hi> 3.—<hi>If then their uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the puniſhment of their iniquity—Lev</hi>—26.—But I forbear to add here, and go on to ſay ſecondly—Sin ſick ſinners loath and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor themſelves for their ſins—God loaths them; as it would be moſt eaſy to prove from the infinite purity of his nature—from both particular and general expreſſions in the bible, holding it forth—from the epithets uſed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive of their character—and from the loathſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to which they are ſo frequently compared.</p>

               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:016172_0018_0F9BC9D359F3EFA8"/>They now begin to ſee things as God ſees them—They loath the fountain of pollution within them. They deteſt a principle of oppoſition to the bleſſed God—They loath all the ſtreams that run thro' life: for they ſmell ſtrong of the fountain. They ſee that they have abundant rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for loathing themſelves. All is deformity, wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and pollution. They appear to be ten thouſand times viler, in their own view, than the beaſts that periſh. They ſee there is ſufficient reaſon why God ſhould loath them forever. Why all good beings ſhould do ſo. Why ſaints and angels ſhould do ſo. They ſee that there is reaſon why they ſhould hold themſelves in perpetual ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence—They marvel that they could ever love ſuch a maſs of corruption, ſuch a body of deformity, of ſin and death—They marvel that they do not loath themſelves more—They ſee no object ſo loathſome, ſo nauſeous and offenſive as a ſinner dead in ſin. They appear more loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to themſelves, than others do to them; becauſe they have a more perfect knowledge of themſelves. Their vileneſs brings them into the loweſt poſture of humility before God. Thus ſpeaks the bible, <hi>O our God, we are aſhamed, and bluſh to lift up our faces before thee our God, for our iniquities have increaſed over our head, and our treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs is grown up unto the heavens.

Job</hi>—40—<hi>Wherefore I abhor myſelf, and repent in duſt and aſhes. Job</hi>—42—It is ſin, which alone is the proper ſource of ſhame, ſorrow and confuſion of face—They loath themſelves for all the diſhonour that they have caſt upon God, upon his character and government: that they have treated the Son of God, and the Spirit of God, in ſuch an unworthy manner: that they have been influenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſuch baſe motives, and directed every thing to ſuch a low end: that they have yielded their members inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

               </gap> that they are unworthy of the ſociety of ſaints and angels, and or communion with the Deity. They chooſe the poſture of importunate beggars at the foot-ſtool. They ſee that they are poor, miſerable, wretched, blind, and naked—In one word, they ſee that they are deſtitute of all goodneſs, moral beauty and love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs—</p>
            <p n="4">4. Sin ſick ſinners feel their abſolute immediate periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing need of Chriſt, to remove ther guilt, and heal their maledies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:016172_0020_0F9BC9D77B5481D0"/>When they are brought to condemn themſelves; to loath and abhor themſelves; to ſee their unworthineſs of any good, their incapacity to help themſelves: When they are driven from every groundleſs plea, and realiſe their deplorable circumſtances, like thoſe in the <hi>Acts, Men and brethren, what ſhall we do? Acts</hi>—2. Then they will ſee their need of Chriſt—They will never go to him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they are forced from every thing elſe. A ſtranger to his own heart, little conceives of the endleſs ſhifts an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened ſinner makes, before he is brought to an hearty cloſure with Chriſt. When the ſinner is ſick of ſin, or weary and heavy laden with it: when it appears to be an inſupportable burden, a vaſt and mountainous load which will ſink him into eternal miſery; and that he muſt deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair of all help from any earthly quarter, then a view of Chriſt as the ſavior of ſinners, will be welcome news. Hence one remark offers it ſelf—That we muſt know what we be, our character and circumſtances, before we ſhall feel our need of Chriſt. If I do not feel that I am a guilty, infinitely guilty creature, I ſhall not ſee the need of ſuch a coſtly ſacrifice for ſin. If I do not realiſe the univerſal and total corruption of my nature, I ſhall not view it of much conſequence to be waſhed in the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Chriſt's ſpotleſs meritorious blood. If I do not feel the hardneſs of my heart, I ſhall forbear any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate and unwearied application to the Spirit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it.—But when we are heartily ſick of ſin, we ſhall diſcover our abſolute need of Chriſt, becauſe every other prop will be thrown down. We ſhall diſcover our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate need, becauſe we are in perpetual danger: our periſhing need, becauſe we periſh eternally, and juſtly too, without him—A diſcovery of our need of Chriſt, is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with other diſcoveries—We diſcover the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his righteouſneſs—Satisfaction, all muſt ſee, muſt be made to juſtice. It has been made. There is an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:016172_0021_0F9BC9D812D24878"/>
of merit in the righteouſneſs of Chriſt. It can never be exhauſted. It was accepted by God, as every way ſufficient. Hence ſin may be conſiſtently, and honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly pardoned. We likewiſe carry to Chriſt a mind to be inlightened, to be cured of innumerable miſtakes and prejudices: we go to have all our blindneſs and darkneſs done away. All this he can do with infinite eaſe.—We diſcover Chriſt as ſuſtaining the office of a king—Hence he is abundantly able to bow our ſtubborn will—to reign in us, and over us, and to give law to our affections and life—Able to bear down all poſſible oppoſition to our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal happineſs. Able to ſupport us under every bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and crown us, thro' ſovereign grace, a triumphant conqueror in heaven—</p>
            <p>Hence we diſcover the perfect ſafety of venturing our ſouls with Chriſt.—We ſee the foundation which is laid in Zion, will bear up our hopes, tho' they are high as heaven, and laſting as eternity. Ample proviſion is made. Proper attention is paid to every thing. Every bar is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved—There is unering wiſdom to direct in the moſt intricate and trying ſcenes. There is infinite power to uphold under the heavieſt preſſures. There is an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing fulneſs of goodneſs forever, by its expreſſions and exerciſes, to refreſh and exhilarate the ſoul—Beſides, The ſin ſick ſinner diſcovers incomparable beauties, and glories in the Savior, and in this method of ſalvation. It is, therefore preferred before every other conceivable or poſſible method. The ſhining of the divine charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and perfections, the honorable maintainance of the divine law and government are great, glorious and ſweet objects. Theſe are uppermoſt in the ſcheme. Hence he ſees that God can be juſt, and true, and holy, and yet the juſtifier of him that believeth in his ſon Jeſus Chriſt. And now Chriſt is ſeated upon the throne in his heart— he is joyfully welcomed within—Crying to the faculties
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:016172_0022_0F9BC9D920979120"/>
of his ſoul, <hi>Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlaſting doors; and the King of Glory ſhall come in. Pſalms</hi>—24—It may be needful to obſerve—that the Spirit is the Author of the whole.</p>
            <p>He begins, carries on, and compleats the work. It is God that fulfils in us the whole good pleaſure of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the grace of faith with Almighty power. Faith is his gift, his work—Every encreaſe of it is from him— As one might ſhew by running over the new teſtement—</p>
            <p>Time is wanting to illuſtrate the whole, or any part of what has been ſaid by the metaphor in the text, which is borrowed from natural things.—</p>
            <p n="2">II. I proceed 2dly, in a breath, To conſider whence it is that Chriſt is welcome to no other character than that which we have deſcribed—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The whole need not a phyſician, but they that are ſick</hi>—</p>
            <p>The plain reaſon is, becauſe that no other perſons are ſick of themſelves, nor of ſin. No other are emptied of ſelf-ſtrength, wiſdom and goodneſs. No other ſee any need of Chriſt. Why then ſhould they go to Chriſt? who came not to call the righteous, but ſinners to repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Why ſhould, healthy ſound people apply to a phyſician for help, for phyſic and a cure? They need no help, no medicines, no cure. One might enlarge. Tho' words can ſcarcely make it plainer.</p>
            <p n="3">III. We paſs in the 3d place—Briefly to deſcribe Chriſt under the character of <hi>the phyſician</hi> of ſin ſick ſinners— the <hi>phyſician</hi> of ſouls—</p>
            <p>He is called by the prophet—<hi>The balm of Gilead.</hi> Jer. 8—<hi>His name is Jeſus, becauſe he ſaves his people from their ſins. Mat</hi>—1—The moſt that might be ſaid here, muſt be waved—We may name a few things; for we can do lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more—Chriſt heals in a ſovereign way—He is under no obligation, beyond his own good pleaſure, and eternal purpoſe to heal any one. He heals whom he will, and
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:016172_0023_0F9BC9D991D6ECD0"/>
paſſes by whom he will—This we are taught in the ſacred pages. Chriſt is a faithful phyſician—He never left the patient that he undertook and engaged to cure. None can tax him with the leaſt injuſtice. He is faithful to do all that he has promiſed to do. The weary and heavy laden, the ſick ſinners upon their cloſing with Chriſt, will find all to be true which he has told them. Chriſt is a moſt compaſſionate phyſician.—He takes all proper care of all the lambs and ſheep of his fold. He knows their burdens, not one for whom he died, will be overlooked and loſt—The name of each is written upon his heart— He is infinitely kind, and compaſſionate—It was peculiar to him—<hi>To bind up the broken hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the priſon to them that are bound: To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for aſhes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praiſe for the ſpirit of heavineſs—Iſa.</hi> 61—<hi>Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt. My yoke is eaſy, and my burden is light. Mat.</hi> 11. He proportions their trials to their ſtrength—Chriſt is a powerful phyſician—There is no diſeaſe of body nor of mind beyond his power. He came to heal the chief of ſinners—Hence there is encouragement to all who have not ſinned the unpardonable ſin—Let our ſins be ever ſo many, and greatly aggravated, yet they ſhall never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the power, and ſkill of this phyſician. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of a perſecuting <hi>Paul,</hi> and a murderous <hi>Manaſah,</hi> may remove our fears on this head—I may not add more here. We ſhall touch at the improvement—</p>
            <div type="improvement">
               <head>IMPROVEMENT.</head>
               <p n="1">1. We remark in the 1ſt place, That ſin ſick ſouls are bleſſed ſouls—Their mourning will be turned into joy. Precious ſeed is ſown in ſuch tears. Sick ſouls will wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the phyſician. And he has promiſed reſt, eternal
<pb n="25"
                      facs="unknown:016172_0024_0F9BC9E19B7772C8"
                      rendition="simple:additions"/>
reſt, and bleſſedneſs to ſuch as come to him. If he gives reſt, all is well. No inſuperable difficulties can ſpring from any quarter. Let the ſoul, if there is ſuch an one in this crowded aſſembly, that is borne down with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable load of ſin, that feels its infinite vileneſs, and internal malignancy, and loaths and hates itſelf, and finds it to be impoſſible to help itſelf, go to Chriſt, and throw itſelf at his feet; for it has ſweet encouragement ſo to do. The condeſcenſion and grace of the Redeemer are very wonderful in undertaking ſuch an arduous work—his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties are many and pathetic: His arms are ever extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to receive the returning ſinner. God even commands us to believe. Surely if we come in a ſuitable manner, he will not ſend us away—</p>
               <p n="2">2. Carnal ſtupid ſinners have no ground to hope for mercy while they are at eaſe—There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but terror, and thunder for them. They are going to hell, tho' they think and care nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it; as faſt as rolling time can carry them.— And God only knows how many of us will drop, without making a perceivable blank in creation, into endleſs burnings, in a little while: it may be in a few weeks, or months. Then farewel Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and all the rich bleſſings of his purchaſe: farewel mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and ſinners: farewel friendly inſtruction, loud warnings, painful labors for our ſalvation. We ſhall then be fixed in unchangable hatred of the glorious God, of all holy beings, and holy duties—We ſhall, beyond diſpute, have diſpiſed mercies, counſels, calls, and inſtructions, turned into uſeleſs things.—</p>
               <p n="3">3. The reaſon why ſinners periſh, is, becauſe they will not go to Chriſt the phyſician of ſouls. The bible attributes it to this. I think therefore, I am warranted to ſay the ſame—<hi>Ye will not come unto
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:016172_0025_0F9BC9E44F4FCCC0"/>
me, that ye might have life. John</hi> 5.40. And it is true now of ſinners as it was 1700 years ago. There is nothing forbids but an unwilling mind. The diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty originates from the oppoſition of our hearts to Chriſt—Were we cordially willing to embrace Chriſt upon his own offer, we ſhould certainly do it. Were we cordially willing, there is nothing in the divine decree <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> the counſels of eternity would prevent. True it is, that our hatred of God is ſo great, ſo deep rooted, ſo implacable, we ſhall never of our own true choice, will an approbation, and hearty ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of Chriſt. But let it ever be kept in view, and written in indelible characters upon our hearts, that the want of this will is our own fault, it is our ſin; and likewiſe, that God has no where bound himſelf to give us one.—</p>
               <p n="4">4. Suffer me, in the laſt place, for I have wearied your patience, to ſuggeſt a few needful cautions, that may tend to prevent our being ſhip-wrecked upon the ſands and rocks that ſurround us—Let us be cautioned againſt deferring an application to this phyſician— Delays harden us. We can not boaſt of an hour. The next minute is not yet ours. If it comes, it may be the laſt. The diſtemper grows worſe. God is now diſhonored by delay; Chriſt is more affront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: the ſpirit is more ſlighted; the offers of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are more undervalued. Our danger encreaſes. Delays are dangerous. How many multitudes have loſt their ſouls by putting off, and putting off! Now, this hour, this minute, while I am ſpeaking, it is time to go to Chriſt—<hi>Thou fool,</hi> may be ſaid of any delayers here preſent, <hi>this night thy ſoul ſhall be required of thee.</hi> And what then? "Procraſtination is the thief of time"—Let no one ſay it is too late;
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:016172_0026_0F9BC9E566AF07C8"/>
my time is paſt. We do not know. It is certain, that preſent delay doth not better our circumſtances. If we come to Chriſt, he will in no wiſe caſt us out. It is alſo certain, that if we do not go, we periſh forever. There is no other alternative: Either go, or reſolve to periſh.—</p>
               <p n="2">2ndly. Apply no where elſe but to Chriſt— There is no other phyſician, no other ſavior, no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther advocate but Chriſt. There is ſalvation in no other, neither is there any other name given under heaven among men by which we can be ſaved. Saints and angels can't heal us: men and means can't of themſelves do it—We ſhall never heal ourſelves— There is balm in Gilead, and a phyſician there,— and no where elſe.—</p>
               <p n="3">3dly. Let us renounce ourſelves wholly in point of juſtification before God—It is a fatal opinion, to ſuppoſe that we can do ſomething, while ſinners, to recommend ourſelves to God, to pacify the Deity, and ſhorten the diſtance between heaven and earth— We can do nothing of this kind. The utmoſt that we do in a natural ſtate is infinitely beneath the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine acceptance. We muſt go with all our ſins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout us to Chriſt to be pardoned and healed to purpoſe. If we wait till we recommend ourſelveſs, we ſhall wait forever, and dye in our ſins.—</p>
               <p n="4">4thly—If we are healed, let us not attribute it in any meaſure to ourſelves, and rob Chriſt of the whole honor of a total cure—Let him have all the honor. It is his due. He fitted every inſtrument for its work and owned it. The ſong of ſaints in heaven is <hi>

               <p>But it is more than time that I draw to a cloſe— However, I think I have a precedent for what I have done. <hi>Paul,</hi> when at <hi>Troas,</hi> expecting to depart on the morrow, preached uncommonly long; deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to do what good he could, another opportunity might never offer.—This eaſily introduces the moſt affecting part of my diſcourſe, my final farewell.— But what did I ſay? My final farewell? Yes, my hearers, I did. This day puts a period to future la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors among you. This day almoſt compleats two years ſince my firſt coming. And pray who thought then, we ſhould this hour have been bidding a long, a long farewell? But in what reſpect doth this day differ from former ones? Permit me to tell you— It puts an end to future regular interviews, ſtated meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings together, and a multitude of kind offices. It puts an end to future opportunity for private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction—We ſhall ſee one another but a few times more: rejoice and weep together no more—There is a period put to my public labors. I ſhall preach to you no more; worſhip with you no more; pray with you no more—this is all over. I ſhall no more endeavor to open to you the wonders of redemption: the endleſs, ever growing wonders of that love, which <hi>Gabriel</hi> plays on every chord—I ſhall no more tell you the vaſt importance, and abſolute neceſſity of converſion; nor the freeneſs, the riches, the ſovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of grace diſplayed in the ſalvation of a ſinner— I ſhall no more, in your hearing, dwell with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure upon the conqueſts and triumphs of the croſs— I ſhall no more, in this houſe a freſh explain, and

enforce the duties of faith and repentance—I ſhall no more with you, for my hearers, aſcend to heaven, and unfold the ſtate of the bleſſed, nor unveil the bottomleſs pit—I ſhall no more, with this congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation around me, expoſe in its native baſeneſs, and deformity, in all its deplorable circumſtances, human nature—Upon theſe great and important ſubjects, my pen and voice, as to you, will be ſilent as the grave. Me thinks paſt time comes freſh to mind, when I well remember, this houſe ſeemed to hang upon a feeble tongue. And will not you yourſelves bear me witneſs, that I labored to the utmoſt, if, at ſuch a time, ſome word might make an indelible impreſſion upon a former thoughtleſs mind. And ſhall I never, never have any more ſuch opportunities in this place, where I have ſo long been laboring? No, never. They are gone as a dream or viſion of the night. It is often hard parting from a ſhort acquaintance: But how much more difficult to leave near and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable friends, when the band is ſtrengthened by time, ripened into firmneſs by age, and endeared by a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand things? Experience this day convinces my friends and me—It is rending work—An unexpected Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence has kept me here laboring till this time. And the ſame Providence that ſeemed at firſt to invite me here, now points it to be my duty to go away. And ſince it is the will of heaven I heartily acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſce in it, not with ſtanding all that can be thrown into the other ſcale—But whom do I leave? My near re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, that view me as a ſon and brother. I leave him, who to univerſal acceptance and admiration fills the firſt place of honor and importance in the <hi>State.</hi> I leave a large majority of this reſpectable congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation that have long manifeſted an inviolable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment

to me. All theſe I leave.—I thank you, my dear friends, who will, probably, never ſee me ſtand in this deſk again, I moſt ſincerely thank you for your many and frequent kind offices: for the place that I have long had in your affections; for all the prayers that you have put up for me, in ſecret, private and public. I ſtill aſk your prayers; and the prayers of you all. I thank you for that readineſs and chearfulneſs with which you have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended my ſervices among you: for all your endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors to render me comfortable and uſeful. I thank the young and old of both ſexes, that have mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted a friendly heart, and treated me with unaffect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed kindneſs. And I would thank God in his houſe, if I have done you any good: if I have inſtructed, refreſhed, and comforted any by the ſincere milk of the word.—And if I have been ſeverely handled, and illy dealt with by any that have acted uniform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt my continuance and ſettlement, I pray God to forgive them, and open their eyes—to bleſs them in life, at death and thro' eternity—and I pray, that my dear friends may never remember it to the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture diſadvantage of this church and ſociety; to the continuance of preſent difficulties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the preventing of the ſettling a goſpel miniſter, and the deſtruction of peace. Let every thing uncomfortable and amiſs be forgotten, and buried in eternal ſilence. Let the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent ſpirit of chriſtianity poſſeſs all your hearts, run thro' your counſels, and ſpeak in every action. Suffer me, at parting, to ſuggeſt ſome things that may deſerve your notice and remembrance—</p>
               <p>And let me do it in the more pertinent words of inſpiration— <hi>Let no man ſeek his own, but every man another's wealth</hi>—Let each one conſult the good of

the whole. For while together, you are members of the ſame body. Let all throw all their abilites, their influence upon the ſide of the general good. May no one militate againſt it. Let all promote one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others holineſs, comfort, and ſalvation. Each one ſhould make it a fixed principle to do all that he can for the good of ſociety, by his prayers, his counſels and labors—Again—<hi>Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love</hi>—Oh my hearers, what is ſweeter on this ſide of heaven, than to love and be beloved: to love like brethren, like chriſtians: to hear each others burdens, and comfort one another's hearts? Love will unite you, like plain poliſhed ſurfaces which can't be ſeparated, it will give energy to your mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, ſucceſs to your undertakings—and bring heaven in miniature into every public meeting—Again—<hi>Pray with out ceaſing</hi>—There is enough to pray for—Do not be weary of the duty of ſincere fervent prayer— Pray for one another, and with one another—Such a practice may be attended with the moſt deſirable conſequences. God may give you all the ſame ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able bleſſed temper, while thus employed. Again— <hi>If it be poſſible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably among yourſelves</hi>—If any thing ſhould prevent great familiarity, yet let all be harmleſs and inoffenſive, avoiding all occaſions of quarrels—Beware of reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon one another—of hard ſpeeches—of angry debates—of party meetings—Let the uſual place for meeting, be the place to diſcuſs points—to hold forth light and truth, and agree upon the happieſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures for the promotion of religion—Let good ſenſe and ſound judgment ever have their proper weight— Guard againſt itching ears. A thirſt for novelty has diſtracted many a people—It is more than probable,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:016172_0031_0F9BC9EE205E6468"/>
that the multiplying of <hi>Candidates,</hi> will multiply your ſorrows—Haſten the ſettlement of the goſpel miniſtry among you. Let no time be loſt. The enemy watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es the favorable moment. Your ſituation is peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly dangerous—As far as poſſible live in peace, is the divine command—One thing worthy of your no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice is—that your religion will bear proportion to your peace and union—The longer and ſharper your conteſts, the leſs religion you will have, till it dwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles into almoſt nothing—Religious quarrels are the worſt of quarrels— And tho' they are about religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on—it is commonly loſt—Let all remember the day of judgment—when we ſhall all meet together, and our hearts will be opened to the view of men and angels—Let eternity ever be in view—Get pure reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to your hearts—Do nothing for the ſucceſs of which you dare not aſk a bleſſing—<hi>Finally,</hi> my brethren, <hi>farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace ſhall be with you</hi>—2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. I bid you all, once more, both young and old, men, women and children, farewell—And will God grant that we may all meet and dwell together in heaven—Where there is no jealouſy, no coldneſs, no diſaffection—but all is perfect peace, uninterrupted harmony and eternal love: Where divine love runs thro' every ſoul, and burns with an unquenchable flame. Amen and Amen.</p>
