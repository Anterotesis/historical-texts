            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>POLITICAL OBSERVATIONS.</head>
            <p>A VARIETY of publications in pamphlets and other forms, have appeared in different parts of the union, ſince the ſeſſion of Congreſs which ended in June, 1794; endeavoring, by diſcoulored repreſentations of our public affairs, and particularly of certain occurrences of that ſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to turn the tide of public opinion into a party chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel. The immediate object of the writers, was either avowedly or evidently to operate on the approaching electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Federal Repreſentatives. As that criſis will have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely elapſed, before the following obſervations will appear; they will, at leaſt, be free from a charge of the ſame views; and will, conſequently, have the ſtronger claim to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate attention and reflection to which they are ſubmitted.</p>
            <p>The publications alluded to, have paſſed ſlightly over the tranſactions of the Firſt and Second Congreſs; and ſo far, their example will here be followed.</p>
            <p>Whether, indeed, the funding ſyſtem was modelled, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the principles of ſubſtantial juſtice, or on the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of public faith? Whether it did not contain ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents friendly to the duration of the public debt, and imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it was regarded as a public good? Whether the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of the ſtate debts was not enforced by overcharged repreſentations; and Whether, if the burdens had been equalized only, inſtead of being aſſumed in the groſs, the ſtates could not have diſcharged their reſpective proportions, by their local reſources, ſooner and more conveniently, than the general government will be able to diſcharge the whole debts, by general reſources? Whether the exciſe ſyſtem, be congenial with the ſpirit, and conducive to the happineſs of our country; or can even juſtify itſelf as a productive ſource of Revenue? Whether again the bank was not eſtabliſhed without authority from the conſtitution? Whether it did not throw unneceſſary and unreaſonable advantages into the hands of men; previouſly enriched beyond reaſon or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity:
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:029017_0002_0FDE960D6B4E8470"/>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>According to the plan of the bank, originally recommended, in the report of the Secretary of the Treaſury, the charter was to continue until the final redemption of that part of its ſtock, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of public debt; that is until the whole of the ſix percent ſtock ſhould be redeemed, for the part held by the bank could not be finally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed until the final redemption of the entire maſs. In the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the bill through Congreſs, the term, not without difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (as it appears) was fixed at about twenty years. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this reduction, the market value of bank ſtock, has given an average profit to the ſubſcribers of thirty or forty per cent on their capitals; or an aggregate profit of three, on the aggregate capital of eight millions; and it could not otherwiſe happen, than that this immenſe gain, would fall into the hands of thoſe, who had gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed moſt by purchaſes of certificates, becauſe the great purchaſers being moſt on the watch, having the beſt intelligence, and in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral actually attended in perſon, or by agents on the operations of the government, would of courſe, be the firſt to ſeize the proffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed advantage, in excluſion of the primitive, the diſtant, and the uninformed, if not miſinformed, holders of the ſubſcribable pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
                  <p> It has actually happened, that the firſt proviſion for redeeming the debt, at the ſtipulated rate, has been poſtponed for five years: and the proviſion now made, if no interruption whatever ſhould take place, will not effect the object within leſs than twenty-five or thirty years. It will not be difficult to compute the additional profit, which would have accrued to the ſtockholders, had the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal plan been adopted. But there is another, and perhaps a more important view of the tendency of a plan making the durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the charter, to depend on the duration of the public debt. It would have ſtimulated, by the ſtrongeſt motive of intereſt, that important and influential corporation, to impede the final diſcharge of the public debt, in order to prolong its charter and its emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. At preſent indeed it has but too obvious a temptation to favor the continuance and increaſe of public debts; ſince new debts call for anticipations by loans of its paper; and produce new taxes, by which the circulation of its paper is extended.</p>
                  <p> Thoſe who attended to this ſubject, with minds clouded, neither by prejudice nor by intereſt, will rightly decide on the union which has ſubſiſted between a ſeat in Congreſs and a ſeat at the bank.— The indecorum as well as evil tendency of the alliance, has, by provoking the cenſorial notice of the public, produced a tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſſolution of it. Query, whether there be not a remnant of the abuſe, in the caſe of ſuch as are at the ſame time ſtockholders of the bank and members of Congreſs? In the latter character, they vote for borrowing money on public account, which in their former character they are to lend on their own account.</p>
               </note> And whether it can be allowed the praiſe of a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutary operation, until its effects ſhall have been more accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately traced, and its hidden tranſactions ſhall be fully un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veiled to the public eye. Theſe and others are queſtions, which, though of great importance, it is not intended here
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:029017_0003_0FDE960FAD6D70B8"/>
to examine. Moſt of them have been finally decided by the competent authority; and the reſt have, no doubt, already impreſſed themſelves on the public attention.</p>
            <p>Paſſing on then to the ſeſſion of Congreſs preceding the laſt, we are met in the firſt place, by the moſt ſerious char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges againſt the ſouthern members of Congreſs in general, and particularly againſt the repreſentatives of Virginia.— They are charged with having ſupported a policy which would inevitably have involved the United States in the war of Europe, have reduced us from the rank of a free peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to that of French colonies, and poſſibly have landed us in diſunion, anarchy, and miſery; and the policy, from which theſe tremendous calamities was to flow, is referred to certain commercial reſolutions moved by a member from Virginia, in the houſe of Repreſentatives.</p>
            <p>To place in its true light, the fallacy which infers ſuch conſequences from ſuch a cauſe, it will be proper to review the circumſtances which preceeded and attended the reaſon.</p>
            <p>It is well known, that at the peace between the United States and Great Britain, it became a queſtion with the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whether ſhe ſhould endeavor to regain the loſt commerce of America, by liberal and reciprocal arrangements; or truſt to a relapſe of it, into its former channels, without the price of ſuch arrangements on her part. Whilſt ſhe was fearful that our commerce would be conducted into new and rival channels, ſhe leaned to the firſt ſide of the alternative, and a bill was actually carried in the Houſe of Commons, by the preſent Prime Miniſter correſponding with that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent. She ſoon, however, began to diſcover (or to hope) that the weakneſs of our Federal Government, and the want of concurrence among the ſtate governments would ſecure her againſt the danger at firſt apprehended. From that moment all ideas of conciliation and conceſſion vaniſhed. She de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to enjoy at once the full benefit of the freedom al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by our regulations, and of the monopolies, eſtabliſhed by her own.</p>
            <p>In this ſtate of things, the pride, as well as the intereſt of America were every where arouſed. The mercantile world in particular, was all on fire, complaints flew from one end of the continent to the other, projects of retaliation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, engroſſed the public attention. At one time, the ſtates endeavored by ſeparate efforts, to counteract the une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual laws of Great Britain. At another, correſpondencies were opened fox uniting their efforts. An attempt was alſo
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:029017_0004_0FDE9611338D72E0"/>
made, to veſt in the former Congreſs, a limited power for a limited time, in order to give effect to the general will.</p>
            <p>All theſe experiments, inſtead of anſwering the purpoſe in view, ſerved only to confirm Great Britain in her firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief that her reſtrictive plans, were in no danger of retalia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>It was at length determined by the Legiſlature of Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia to go to work in a new way. It was propoſed, and moſt of the ſtates agreed, to ſend commiſſioners to digeſt ſome change in our general ſyſtem, that might prove an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual remedy. The Commiſſioners met; but finding their powers too circumſcribed for the great object, which expanded itſelf before them, they propoſed a convention on a more enlarged plan, for a general reviſion of the Federal Government.</p>
            <p>From this convention proceeded the preſent Federal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, which gives to the general will, the means of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding in the ſeveral neceſſary caſes, for the general welfare; and particularly in the caſe of regulating our commerce in ſuch manner as may be required by the regulations of other countries.</p>
            <p>It was natural to expect, that one of the firſt objects of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation under the new conſtitution, would be that which had been firſt, and moſt contemplated in forming it. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly it was at the firſt ſeſſion propoſed that ſomething ſhould be done analagous to the wiſhes of the ſeveral ſtates, and expreſſive of the efficiency of the new government. A diſcrimination between nations in treaty, and thoſe not in treaty, the mode moſt generally embraced by the ſtates, was agreed to in ſeveral forms, and adhered to in repeated votes, by a very great majority of the houſe of Repreſentatives. The Senate, however, did not concur with the houſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives, and our commercial arrangements were made up without any proviſion on the ſubject.</p>
            <p>From that date to the ſeſſion of Congreſs ending in June, 1794, the interval paſſed without any effective appeal to the intereſt of Great Britain. A ſilent reliance was placed on her voluntary juſtice, or her enlightened intereſt.</p>
            <p>The long and patient reliance being aſcribed (as was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told) to other cauſes, than a generous forbearance on the part of the United States, had, at the commencement of the third Congreſs, left us with reſpect to a reciprocity of commercial regulations between the two countries, preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly where the commencement of the firſt Congreſs had found
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:029017_0005_0FDE9612BAC253F0"/>
us. This was not all, the weſtern poſts, which entailed an expenſive Indian war on us, continued to be withheld; although all pretext for it had been removed on our part. Depredations, as derogatory to our rights, as grievous to our intereſts, had been evinced by the Britiſh Government againſt our lawful commerce on the high ſeas. And it was believed, on the moſt probable grounds, that the meaſure by which the Algerine Pirates were let looſe on the Atlantic, had not taken place without the participation of the ſame un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friendly counſels. In a word, to ſay nothing of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can victims to ſavages and barbarians, it was eſtimated that our annual damages from Great Britain, were not leſs than three or four millions of dollars.</p>
            <p>This diſtreſſing ſituation ſpoke the more loudly to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotiſm of the Repreſentatives of the people, as the nature and manner of the communications from the Preſident, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make a formal and affecting appeal on the ſubject, to their co-operation. The neceſſity of ſome effort was palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The only room for different opinions ſeemed to lie in the different modes of redreſs propoſed. On one ſide no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was propoſed, beyond the eventual meaſures of defence, in which all concurred, except the building of ſix fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, for the purpoſe of enforcing our rights againſt Algiers. The other ſide conſidering this meaſure, as pointed at one only of our evils, and as inadequate even to that, thought it beſt to ſeek for ſome ſafe, but powerful remedy, that might be applied to the root of them; and with this view the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial Propoſitions were introduced.</p>
            <p>They were at firſt oppoſed on the ground, that Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain was amicably diſpoſed towards the United States; and that we ought to await the event of the depending negociati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. To this it was replied, that more than four years of appeal to that diſpoſition, had been tried in vain, by the new government, that the negociation had been abortive, and was no longer depending, that the late letters <note n="*" place="bottom">See his letter of 15th Auguſt, 1793, to the Secretary of State, in the printed communications from the Preſident to the Congreſs.</note> from Mr. Pinckney, the miniſter at London, had not only cut off all remaining hope from that ſource, but had expreſsly point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Commercial Regulations as the moſt eligible redreſs to be purſued.</p>
            <p>Another ground of oppoſition, was, that the United States
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:029017_0006_0FDE96171E2E41E0"/>
were more dependant on the trade of Great Britain, than Great Britain was on the trade of the United States. This will appear ſcarcely credible to thoſe who underſtand the commerce between the two countries, who recollect, that it ſupplies us chiefly with ſuperſluities, whilſt in return it em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys the induſtry of one part of her people, ſends to another part the very bread which keeps them from ſtarving, and remits moreover, an annual balance in ſpecie of ten or twelve millions of dollars. <note n="*" place="bottom">This balance is not preciſe, but may be deemed within the amount. It appears from a late, and apparently an office ſtatement from <hi>Great Britain</hi> of exports and imports between Great Britain and the United States, that the actual balance in the year 1791, was <hi>threemillions, thirty one thouſand two hundred and fifteen pounds, fourteen and nine pence ſterl,</hi> and in the year 1792, <hi>three millions, two hundred and thirty one thouſand, and ninety pounds, ſeven ſhillings and four penceſterl,</hi> equal to <hi>fourteen millions, three hundred and ſixty thouſand, four hundred and one dollar.</hi> As this relates to the trade with Great Britain only, the balance in our favor in the Weſt India trade is to be deducted. There is reaſon to believe, that it would not reduce the general balance ſo low, as is above ſtated; beſides, that the balance againſt us, in the trade with Ireland, is not taken into the account.</note> It is true, nevertheleſs, as the debate ſhews, that this was the language, however ſtrange, of ſome who combated the propoſitions.</p>
            <p>Nay, what is ſtill more extraordinary, it was maintained that the United States, had, on the whole, little or no reaſon to complain of the footing of their commerce with Great Britain; although ſuch complaints had prevailed in every ſtate, among every claſs of citizens ever ſince the year 1783; and although the Federal Conſtitution had originated in thoſe complaints, and had been eſtabliſhed with the known view of redreſſing them.</p>
            <p>As ſuch objections could have little effect in convincing the judgement of the Houſe of Repreſentatives, and ſtill leſs that of the public at large; a new mode of aſſailing the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions has been ſubſtituted. The American People love peace; and the cry of war might alarm when no hope remained of convincingthem, the cry of war has accordingly been echo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through the continent with a loudneſs proportioned to the emptineſs of the pretext, and to this cry has been added, another ſtile more abſurd, that the propoſitions would in the end, enſlave the United States to their allies, and plunge them into anarchy and miſery.</p>
            <p>It is very mortifying to be obliged to tax the patience of
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:029017_0007_0FDE961C2855D228"/>
the reader, with an examination of ſuch groſs abſurdities; but it may be of uſe to expoſe, where there be no neceſſity to refuſe them.</p>
            <p>What were the Commercial Propoſitions? They diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated between nations in treaty, and nations not in trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by an additional duty on the manufactures and trade of the latter; and they reciprocated the navigation laws of all nations, who excluded the veſſels of the United States, from a common right of being uſed in the trade between the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States, and ſuch nations.</p>
            <p>Is there any thing here that could afford a cauſe, or a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text for war to Great Britain or any other nation? If we hold at preſent the rank of a free people; if we are no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger colonies of Great Britain; if we have not already relapſed into ſome dependence on that nation, we have the felt-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent right, to regulate our trade according to our own will, and our own intereſt, not according to her will or her intereſt. This right can be denied to no independent nation. It has not been, and will not be denied to ourſelves by any opponent of the propoſitions.</p>
            <p>If the propoſitions could give no right to Great Britain to make war, would they have given any color to her for ſuch an outrage on us? No American Citizen will affirm it. No Britiſh ſubject, who is a man of candor, will pretend it; becauſe he muſt know, that the commercial regulations of Great Britain herſelf have diſcriminated among foreign na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whenever it was thought convenient. They have diſcriminated againſt particular nations by name; they have diſcriminated, with reſpect to particular articles by name, by the nations producing them, and by the places exporting them. And as to the navigation articles propoſed, they were not only common to the other countries along with Great Britain; but reciprocal between Great Britain and the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States: Nay, it is notorious, that they fell ſhort of an immediate and exact reciprocity of her own Navigation Laws.</p>
            <p>Would any nation be ſo barefaced as to quarrel with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for doing the ſame thing which ſhe herſelf has done, for doing leſs than ſhe herſelf has done, towards that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular nation? It is impoſſible that Great Britain would ever expoſe herſelf by ſo abſurd, as well as arrogant a proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. If the really meant to quarrel with this country, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prudence, and common decency would preſcribe ſome other leſs odious pretext for her hoſtility.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:029017_0008_0FDE961DADEAC6A8"/>
It is the more aſtoniſhing that ſuch a charge againſt the propoſitions ſhould have been hazarded, when the opinion, and the proceedings, of America, on the ſubject of our own commercial policy is reviewed.</p>
            <p>Whilſt the power over trade, remained with the ſeveral States, there were few of them that did not exerciſe it, on the principle, if not in the mode of the commercial propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions. The eaſtern States generally paſſed laws, either diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminating between ſome foreign nations and others, or levelled againſt Great Britain by name. Maryland and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia did the ſame, ſo did two, if not three, of the more ſouthern States. Was it ever, during that period, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at home or abroad, that a cauſe or pretext for quarrel, was given to Great Britain or any other nation? or were our rights better underſtood at that time, than at this, or more likely then, than now, to command the reſpect due to them.</p>
            <p>Let it not be ſaid, Great Britain was then at peace, ſhe is now at war. It ſhe would not wantonly attempt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul the exerciſe of our ſovereign rights, when ſhe had no other enemy on her hands, will ſhe be mad enough to make the attempt, when her hands are fully employed with the war already on them? Would not thoſe who ſay now, poſtpone the meaſures until Great Britain ſhall be at peace, be more ready, and have more reaſon to ſay in time of peace, poſtpone them until ſhe ſhall be at war; there will then be no danger of her throwing new enemies into the ſcale against her.</p>
            <p>Nor let it be ſaid, that the combined powers, would aid and ſtimulate Great Britain, to wage an unjuſt war on the United States. They alſo are too fully occupied with their preſent enemy, to wiſh for another on their hands; not to add, that two of thoſe powers, being in treaty with the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited States, are favored by the propoſitions; and that all of them are well known to entertain an habitual jealouſy of the monopolizing character and maritime aſcendency of that nation.</p>
            <p>One thing ought to be regarded as certain and concluſive on this head, whilſt the war againſt France remains unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful, the United States are in no danger, from any of the powers engaged in it. In the event of a complete over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of that Republic, it is impoſſible to ſay, what might follow. But if the hoſtile views of the combination, ſhould be turned towards this continent, it would clearly not be, to
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:029017_0009_0FDE961F34862AC0"/>
vindicate the commercial intereſts of Great-Britain againſt the commercial rights of the United States. The object would be, to root out Liberty from the face of the earth. No pretext would be wanted, or a better would be contrived, than any thing to be found in the commercial propoſitions.</p>
            <p>On whatever other ſide we view the clamor againſt theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, as inevitably productive of war, it preſents neither evidence to juſtify it, nor argument to colour it.</p>
            <p>The intellegation neceſſarily ſuppoſes, either that the friends of the plan could diſcover no probability, where its opponents could ſee a certainty, or that the former were leſs averſe to war, than the latter.</p>
            <p>The firſt ſuppoſition will not be diſcuſſed. A few obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the other may throw new lights on the whole ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
            <p>The members, in general, who eſpouſed theſe propoſitions, have been conſtantly in that part of the Congreſs, who have proſeſſed with moſt zeal, and purſued with moſt ſcruple, the characteriſtics of republican government. They have adhered to theſe characteriſtics in deſining the meaning of the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in adjuſting the ceremonial of public proccedings, and in making out the courſe of the adminiſtration. They have mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, particularly, a deep conviction of the danger to Liberty and the Conſtitution, from a gradual aſſumption or extenſion of diſcretionary powers in the executive departments; from ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive augmentions of a ſtanding army; and from the perpetuity and progreſſion of public debts and taxes. They have been ſometimes reprehended in debate for an exceſs of caution and jealouſy on theſe points. And the news-papers of a certain ſtamp, by diſtorting and diſcolouring this part of their conduct, have painted it in all the deformity, which the moſt induſtrious calumny could deviſe.</p>
            <p>Thoſe beſt acquainted with the individuals who more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly ſupported the propoſitions, will be foremoſt to teſtify, that ſuch are the principles which not only govern them in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic life, but which are invariably maintained by them in every other ſituation. And it cannot be believed, nor ſuſpected, that with ſuch principles they could view war as leſs an evil than it appeared to their opponents.</p>
            <p>Of all the enemies to public liberty, war is, perhaps, the moſt to be dreaded, becauſe it compriſes and developes the genius of every other. War is the parent of armies; from theſe proceed debts and taxes: and armies, and debts, and taxes are the known inſtruments for bringing the many under the denomination of the few. In war, too, the diſcretionary power of the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive is extended; its influence, in dealing out offices, honors, and emoluments, is multiplied; and all the means of ſeducing
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:029017_0010_0FDE9623432D2FC8"/>
the minds, are added to thoſe of ſubduing the force of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The ſame malignant aſpect in republicaniſm, may be traced in the inequality of fortunes, and the opportunities of fraud, growing out of a ſtate of war, and in the degeneracy of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and of morals, engendered by both. No nation could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve its freedom, in the midſt of continual warfare.</p>
            <p>Thuſe truths are well eſtabliſhed. They are read in every page which records the progreſſion, from a leſs arbitrary to a more arbitrary government, or the tranſition from a popular go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, to an ariſtocracy or a monarchy.</p>
            <p>It muſt be evident, then, that in the ſame degree as the friends of the propoſitions were jealous of armies, and debts, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pogative, as dangerous to a republican conſtitution; they muſt have been averſe to war, as favorable to armies, and debts, and prepogative.</p>
            <p>The fact accordingly appears to be, that they were particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly averſe to war. They not only conſidered the propoſitions as having no tendency to war, but preferred them, as the moſt likely means of obtaining our objects without war. They thought, and thought truly, that Great-Britain was more vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable in her commerce, than in her fleets and armies; that ſhe valued our neceſſaries for her markets, and our markets for her ſuperfluities, more than ſhe feared our frigates or our militia; and that ſhe would, conſequently, be more ready to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per conceſſions under the influence of the former, than of the latter motive.</p>
            <p>Great-Britain is a commercial nation. Her power, as well as her wealth, is derived from commerce. The American com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce is the moſt valuable branch ſhe enjoys. It is the more valuable, not only as being of vital importance to her in ſome reſpects, but of growing importance, beyond eſtimate, in its general character. She will not eaſily part with ſuch a reſource. She will not raſhly hazard it. She would be particularly aware of forcing a perpetuiry of regulations, which not merely diminiſh her ſhare, but may favor the rivalſhip of other nations. If any thing, therefore, in the power of the United States, could over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come her pride, her avidity, and her repugnancy to this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, it was juſtly concluded to be, not the fear of our arms, which, though invincible in defence, are little formidable in a war of offence, but the fear of ſuffering in the moſt fruitful branch of her trade, and of ſeeing it diſtributed among her rivals.</p>
            <p>If any doubt on this ſubject could exiſt, it would vaniſh on a recollection of the conduct of the Britiſh miniſtry at the cloſe of the war in 1783. It is a fact which has been already touched, and is as notorious as it is inſtructive, that during the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of finding her commerce with the United States abridged or
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:029017_0011_0FDE96285AA05C48"/>
endangered by the conſequences of the revelution, Great-Britain was ready to purchaſe it, even at the expence of her Weſt-Indies monopoly. it was not until after ſhe began to perceive the weakneſs of the federal government, the diſcord in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teracting plans of the ſtate governments, and the intereſt ſhe would be able to eſtabliſh here, that ſhe ventured on that ſyſtem to which ſhe has ſince inflexibly adhered. Had the preſent fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral government, on its firſt eſtabliſhment, done what it ought to have done, what it was inſtituted for, and expected to do, and what was actually propoſed and intended it ſhould do; had it revived and confirmed the belief in Great-Britain, that our trade and navigation would not be free to her without an equal and reciprocal freedom to us, in her trade and navigation, we have her own authority for ſaying, that ſhe would long ſince have met us on proper ground; becauſe the ſame motives which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the bill brought into the Britiſh parliament by Mr. Pitt, in order to prevent the evil apprehended, would have produced the ſame conceſſion, at leaſt in order to obtain a recall of the evil, after it had taken place.</p>
            <p>The averſion to war in the friends of the propoſitions, may be traced through the whole proceedings and debates of the ſeſſion. After the depredations in the Weſt-Indies, which ſeemed to fill up the meaſure of Britiſh aggreſſions, they adhered to their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal policy of purſuing redreſs, rather by commercial, than by hoſtile operations; and with this view unanimouſly concurred in the bill for ſuſpending importations from Britiſh ports; a bill that was carried through the houſe by a vote of fifty-eight againſt thirty-four. The friends of the propoſitions appeared, indeed, never to have admitted, that Great-Britain could ſeriouſly mean to force a war with the United States, unleſs in the event of proſtrating the French Republic; and they did not believe that ſuch an event was to be apprehended.</p>
            <p>Conſiding in this opinion, to which Time has given its full fanction, they could not accede to thoſe extraordinary meaſures, which nothing ſhort of the moſt obvious and imperious neceſſity could plead for. They were as ready as any, to fortify our harbours, and fill our magazines and arſenals; theſe were ſafe and requiſite proviſions for our permanent defence. They were ready and anxious for arming and preparing our militia; that was the true republican bulwark of our ſecurity. They joined alſo in the addition of a regiment of artillery to the military eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment, in order to complete the defenſive arrangement on our eaſtern frontier. Theſe facts are on record, and are the proper anſwer to thoſe ſhameleſs calumnies which have aſſerted, that the friends of the commercial propoſitions were enemies to every propoſition for the national ſecurity.</p>
            <p>But it was their opponents, not they, who continually main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, that on a failure of negociation, it would be more eligible
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:029017_0012_0FDE9629E00893A8"/>
to ſeek redreſs by war, than by commercial regulations; who talked of raiſing armies, that might threaten the neighbouring poſſeſſions of foreign powers; who contended for delegating to the executive the prerogatives of deciding whether the country was at war or not, and of levying, organizing, and calling into the field, a regular army of ten, fifteen, nay, of TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND men.</p>
            <p>It is of ſome importance that this part of the hiſtory of the ſeſſion, which has found no place in the late reviews of it, ſhould be well underſtood. They who are curious to learn the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, muſt examine the debates and the votes. A full narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive would exceed the limits which are here preſcribed. It muſt ſuffice to remark, that the efforts were varied and repeated until the laſt moment of the ſeſſion, even after the departure of a number of members; forbade new propoſitions, much more a renewal of rejected ones; and that the powers propoſed to be ſurrendered to the executive, were thoſe which the conſtitution has moſt jealouſly appropriated to the legiſlature.</p>
            <p>The reader ſhall judge on this ſubject for himſelf.</p>
            <p>The conſtitution expreſsly and excluſively veſts in the legiſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the power of declaring a ſtate of war: it was propoſed, that the executive might, in the receſs of the legiſlature, declare the United States to be in a ſtate of war.</p>
            <p>The conſtitution expreſsly and excluſively veſts in the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the power of raiſing armies: it was propoſed, that in the receſs of the legiſlature, the executive might, at its pleaſure, raiſe or not raiſe an army of ten, fifteen, or twenty-five thouſand men.</p>
            <p>The conſtitution expreſsly and excluſively veſts in the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the power of creating offices: it was propoſed, that the executive, in the receſs of the legiſlature, might create offices, as well as appoint officers for an army of ten, fifteen, or twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>five thouſand men.</p>
            <p>A delegation of ſuch powers would have ſtruck, not only at the fabric of our conſtitution, but at the foundation of all well organized and well checked governments.</p>
            <p>The ſeparation of the power of declaring war, from that of conducting it, is wiſely contrived, to exclude the danger of its being declared for the ſake of its being conducted.</p>
            <p>The ſeparation of the power of raiſing armies, from the power of commanding them, is intended to prevent the raiſing armies for the ſake of commanding them.</p>
            <p>The ſeparation of the power of creating offices, from that of filling them, is an eſſential guard againſt the temptation to create offices, for the ſake of gratifying favorites, or multiplying de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants.</p>
            <p>Where would be the difference between the blending theſe incompatible powers, by ſurrendering the legiſlative part of them
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:029017_0013_0FDE962B673BABB0"/>
into the hands of the executive, and by aſſuming the executive part of them into the hands of the legiſlative? In either caſe the principle would be equally deſtroyed, and the conſequences equally dangerous.</p>
            <p>An attempt to anſwer theſe obſervations, by appealing to the virtues of the preſent chief magiſtrate, and to the confidence juſtly placed in them, will be little calculated, either for his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine patriotiſm, or for the ſound judgment of the American public.</p>
            <p>The people of the United States would not merit the praiſe univerſally allowed to their intelligence, if they did not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between the reſpect due to the man, and the functions belonging to the office. In expreſſing the former, there is no limit or guide, but the feelings of the grateful heart. In decid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the latter, they will conſult the conſtitution; they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider human nature, and, looking beyond the character of the exiſting magiſtrate, fix their eyes on the precedent which muſt deſcend to his ſucceſſors.</p>
            <p>Will it be more than truth to ſay, that this great and venerable name is too often aſſumed for what cannot recommend itſelf, and for what there is neither proof nor probability, that its ſanction can be claimed? Do arguments fail? Is the public mind to be encountered? There are not a few ever ready to invoke the name of Waſhington; to garniſh their heretical doctrines with his virtues, and ſeaſon their unpalletable meaſures with his hoſpitality. Thoſe who take this liberty, will not, however, be miſtaken; his trueſt friends will be the laſt to ſport with his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, above all, for electioneering purpoſes. And it is but a fair ſuſpicion, that they who draw moſt largely on that fund, are haſtening faſteſt to bankruptcy in their own. As vain would be the attempt to explain away ſuch alarming attacks on the conſtitution, by pleading the difficulty, in ſome caſes, of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a line between the different departments of power; or by recurring to the little precedents which may have crept in, at urgent or unguarded moments.</p>
            <p>It cannot be denied, that there may, in certain caſes, be a difficulty in diſtinguiſhing the exact boundary between legiſlative and executive powers; but the real friend of the conſtitution, and of liberty, by his endeavors to leſſen or avoid the difficulty, will eaſily be known from him who labours to encreaſe the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity, in order to remove the conſtitutional land-marks with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out notice.</p>
            <p>Nor will it be denied, that precedents may be found, where the line of ſeparation between theſe powers has not been ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently regarded; where an improper latitude of diſcretion parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly has been given, or allowed, to the executive depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But what does this prove? That the line ought to be considered as imaginary; that conſtitutional organization of
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:029017_0014_0FDE96332255A088"/>
powers ought to loſe their effect? No—It proves with how much deliberation precedents ought to be eſtabliſhed, and with how much caution arguments from them ſhould be admitted. It may furniſh another criterion, alſo, between the real and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible friend of conſtitutional liberty. The firſt will be as vigilant in reſiſting, as the laſt will be in promoting the growth of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate or inſidious precedents, into eſtabliſhed encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>The next charge to be examined, is the tendency of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions to degrade the United States into French colonies.</p>
            <p>As it is difficult to argue againſt ſuppoſitions made and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied at will, ſo it is happily impoſſible to impoſe on the good ſenſe of this country, by arguments which reſt on ſuppoſitions only. In the preſent queſtion it is firſt ſuppoſed, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the ſelf-evident and ſovereign right of regulating trade, after the example of all independent nations, and that of the example of Great-Britain towards the United States, would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably involve the United States in a war with Great Britain. It is then ſuppoſed, that—the other combined powers, though ſome of them be favored by the regulations propoſed, and all of them be jealous of the maritime predominance of Great Britain, would ſupport the wrongs of Great Britain againſt the rights of the United States, It is laſtly ſuppoſed, that our allies (the French) in the event of ſucceſs in eſtabliſhing their own liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which they owe to our example, would be willing, as well as able, to rob us of ours, which they aſſiſted us in obtaining; and that ſo malignant is their diſpoſition on this head, that we ſhould not be ſpared, even if embarked in a war againſt her own enemy. To finiſh the picture, it is intimated, that in the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of allies, we are the more expoſed to this danger, from the ſecret and hoſtile ambition of France.</p>
            <p>It will not be expected, that any formal refutation ſhould be waſted on abſurdities which anſwer themſelves. None but thoſe who have ſurrendered their reaſoning faculties to the evidences of their prejudices, will liſten to ſuggeſtions implying, that the freeſt nation in Europe is the baſeſt people on the face of the earth; that inſtead of the friendly and feſtive ſympathy indulged by the people of the United States, they ought to go into mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at every triumph of the French arms; that inſtead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding the French revolution as a bleſſing to mankind, and a bulwark to their own, they ought to anticipate its ſucceſs as of all events the moſt formidable to their liberty and ſovereignty; and that, calculating on the political connection with that nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the ſource of additional danger from its enmity and its uſurpation, the firſt favorable moment ought to be ſeized for putting an end to it.</p>
            <p>It is not eaſy to diſmiſs this ſubject, however, without reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with grief and ſurprise, on the readineſs with which many
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:029017_0015_0FDE96355EE0F010"/>
launch into ſpeculations unfriendly to the ſtruggles of France, and regardleſs of the intereſting relations in which that country ſtands to this. They ſeem to be more ſtruck with every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that can be made a topic of reproach, or of chimerical apprehenſions, than with all the ſplendid objects which are viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble through the gloom of a revolution. But if there be an American who can ſee, without benovolent joy, the proſpects of that liberty to which he owes his own happineſs, intereſt, at leaſt, ought to find a place in his calculations: And if he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enlarge his views to the influence of the ſucceſſes and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of France, or our ſafety as a nation, and particularly as a republic, how can he be inſenſible to the benefits preſented to the United States in her commerce? The French markets con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume more of our beſt productions, than are conſumed by any other nation. If a balance in ſpecie be as favorable as is uſually ſuppoſed, the ſum which ſupplies the immenſe drains of our ſpecie, is derived alſo from the ſame ſource, more than from any other. And in the great and precious article of navigation, the ſhare of American tonnage employed in the trade with the French dominions, gives to that trade a diſtinguiſhed value; as well to that part of the union which moſt depends on ſhips and ſeamen for its proſperity, as to that which moſt requires them for its protection.</p>
            <p>Whenever theſe conſiderations ſhall have their full weight, which a calm review will not fail to allow them, none will won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der more than the mercantile claſs of citizens themſelves, that whilſt they ſo anxiouſly wait ſtipulations from Great Britain, which are always within our command, ſo much indifference ſhould be felt to thoſe more important privileges in the trade of France, which, if not ſecured by a ſeaſonable improvement of the commercial treaty with her, may poſſibly be forever loſt to us.</p>
            <p>Among the aſperſions propagated againſt the friends, and the merits arrogated by the opponents, of the commercial propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, much uſe has been made of the envoy-ſhip extraordinary to Great Britain. It has been affirmed, that the former was averſe to the meaſure, on account of its pacific tendency; and that it was embraced by the latter, as the proper ſubſtitute for all commercial operations on the policy of Great Britain. It is to be remembered,
<list>
                  <item>1. That this meaſure originated wholly with the executive.</item>
                  <item>2. That the oppoſition to it in the ſenate (as far as the public have any knowledge of it) was made, not to the meaſure of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing an envoy extraordinary, but to the appointment of the chief juſtice of the United States for that ſervice.</item>
                  <item>4. That the houſe of repreſentatives never gave any opinion on the occaſion, and that no opinion appears to have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in debate by any individual of that houſe, which can be
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:029017_0016_0FDE9636E90D3760"/>
tortured into a diſapprobation of the meaſure, on account of its pacific tendency.</item>

            <p>But it may be fairly aſked of thoſe who oppoſed firſt the Commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Propoſitions, and then the Non-Importation bill, and who <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> their juſtification on the appointment of an envoy extraordinary; wherein lay the inconſiſtency between theſe Legiſlative and Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive plans?</p>
            <p>Was it thought beſt to appeal to the Voluntary Juſtice, or liberal policy of Great Britain, and to theſe only? This was not certainly the caſe with thoſe, who oppoſed the Commercial Appeals to the intereſt and the apprehenſion of Great Britain; Becauſe they were the moſt zealous for appealing to her fears, by military preparations and menaces. If theſe had any meaning, they avowed that Great Britain was not to be brought to reaſon, otherwiſe than by the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of injuring herſelf. And ſuch being her diſpoſition, ſhe would, of courſe, be moſt influenced by meaſures, of which the compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive operation would be moſt againſt her. Whether that would be apprehended from meaſures of the one, or the other kind will eaſily be decided. But in every view, it <hi>fear</hi> was a proper auxiliary to negociation, the appeal to it in the Commercial Meaſures propoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, could not be inconſiſtent with the Envoyſhip. The inconſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy belongs to the reasoning of thoſe who would pronounce it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and effectual to ſay to Great-Britain, do us juſtice, or we will ſeize on Canada, though the loſs will be trifling to you, whilſt the coſt will be immenſe to us; and ſo pronounce it improper and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual to ſay to Great-Britain, do us juſtice, or you will ſuffer a wound, where you will moſt of all feel it, in a branch of your commerce, which feeds one part of your dominions, and ſends an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually to the other, a balance in ſpecie of more than ten millions of dollars.</p>
            <p>The opponents of the commercial meaſures may be aſked, in the next place, to what cauſe the iſſue of the envoy-ſhip, if ſucceſsful, ought to be aſcribed?</p>
            <p>Will it have the pure effect of a benevolent and conciliatory diſpoſition in Great Britain towards the United States? This will hardly be pretended by her warmeſt admirers and advocates. It is diſproved by the whole tenor of her conduct ever ſince we were an independent and republican nation. Had this cordial diſpoſition, or even a diſpoſition to do us juſtice, been really
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:029017_0017_0FDE963870161EA0"/>
felt; the delay would not have been ſpun out to ſo late a day. The moment would rather have been choſen, when we were leaſt in condition, to vindicate our intereſt, by united councils and perſevering efforts. The motives then would have been ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and the merit moſt conſpicuous. Inſtead of this honorable and prudent courle, it has been the vigilant ſtudy of Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, to take all poſſible advantage of our embarraſſments; nor has the leaſt inclination been ſhewn to relax her ſyſtem, except at the criſis in 1783, already mentioned, when, not foreſeeing theſe embarraſſments, ſhe was alarmed for her commerce with the United States.</p>
            <p>Will the ſucceſs be aſcribeable to the reſpect paid to that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try by the meaſure, or to the talents and addreſs of the envoy.</p>
            <p>Such an explanation of the fact, is abſolutely precluded by a ſeries of other facts.</p>
            <p>Soon after the peace, Mr. Adams, the preſent Vice Preſident of the United States, was oppointed Miniſter Plenipotentiary to the Britiſh Court. The meaſure was more reſpectful as no mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual arrangement had been premiſed between the two countries, nor any intimation received from Great Britain, that the civility ſhould be returned; nor was the civility returned during the whole period of his reſidence. The manner in which he was treated, and the United States, through him, his protracted exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the mortifying inefficacy of them, are too much in the public remembrance to need a rehearſal.</p>
            <p>This firſt eſlay on the temper of Great Britain, towards the United States, was prior to the eſtabliſhment of the Federal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. The important change produced in our ſituation by this event, led to another eſſay, which is not unknown to the public. Although in ſtrictneſs, it might not unreaſonably have been expected, after what had been done in the inſtance of Mr. Adams, that the advance towards a diplomatic accommodation ſhould then have come from Great Britain. Mr. G. Morris was made an agent for feeling her pulſe, and ſoothing her pride, a ſecond time. The hiſtory of his operations is not particularly known. It is certain, however, that this repetition of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, produced no ſenſible change on her diſpoſition towards us, much leſs any actual compliance with our juſt expectations and demands. The moſt that can be ſaid is, that it was, after a conſiderable interval, followed by the miſſion of Mr. Hammond to the United States, who, as it is ſaid, however refuſed, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the long reſidence of Mr. Adams at the court of London, without a return of the civility, to commit the dignity of his maſter, until the moſt explicit aſſurances were given, that Mr. Pinckney ſhould immediately counterplace him.</p>
            <p>The miſſion of this laſt reſpectable citizen, forms a third ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the juſtice and good will of the Britiſh Government, on the ſubjects between the two countries. His negociations on that ſide the Atlantic, as well as thoſe through Mr. Hammond on his, having been laid before the Congreſs, and printed for gene
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:029017_0018_0FDD6092419B1260"/>
neral information, will ſpeak for themſelves. It will only be remarked, that they terminated here in the diſcloſure, that Mr. Hammond had no authority, either to adjuſt the differences connected with the Treaty of Peace, or to concur in any ſolid arrangements, for reciprocity in Commerce and Navigation; and that in Great Britain, they terminated in the conviction of Mr. Pinckney, that nothing was to be expected from the voluntary juſtice or policy of that country, and in his advice, before quot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of <hi>Commercial Regulations,</hi> as the beſt means for obtaining a compliance with our juſt claims.</p>
            <p>All who weigh theſe facts with candor, will join in conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the ſucceſs of the envoyſhip muſt be otherwiſe explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than by the operation of diplomatic compliments, or of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal talents.</p>
            <p>To what cauſes then will the United States be truly indebted, for any favorable reſult to the envoyſhip.</p>
            <p>Every well-informed and unprejudiced mind, will anſwer to the following:</p>
            <p>1. The ſpirit of America, expreſſed by the vote of the Houſe of Repreſentatives, on the ſubject of the Commercial Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by the large majority of that houſe (overruled by the caſting voice in the Senate) in favor of the non importation bill and by the act laying an embargo. Although theſe proceedings would, doubtleſs, have been more officious, if the two former had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the ſanction of laws, and if the laſt had not been ſo ſoon repealed; <note n="*" place="bottom">That this is particularly true of the embargo, is certain, as well from the known affidavit of that meaſure in the Weſt Indies as from the admiſſion of the Weſt India planters in their late petition to the King and Council of Great Britain.</note> yet they muſt have had no little effect, as warnings to the Britiſh government; that if her obſtinacy take away the laſt pretext from the opponents of ſuch meaſures, it might be impoſſible to divide or miſlead our public councils with reſpect to them in future.</p>
            <p>There is no room to pretend, that her relaxation in this caſe, if ſhe ſhould relax, will be the effect, not of thoſe proceedings, but of the ultimate defect of them; former defeats of a like poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, had repeatedly taken place, and are known to have produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, inſtead of relaxation, a more confirmed perſeverance, on the part of Great-Britain. Under the old confederation, the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States had not the power over commerce: of that ſituation ſhe took advantage. The new government which contained the power, did not evince the will to exert it; of that ſituation ſhe ſtill took the advantage. Should ſhe yield then at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent juncture? The problem ought not to be ſolved, without preſuming her to be ſatisfied by what has lately paſſed—that the United States have now, not only the power, but the will to exert it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:029017_0019_0FDE963D5803FEB8"/>
The reaſoning is ſhort and concluſive; in the year 1783, when Great Britain apprehended Commercial Reſtrictions from the United States, ſhe was diſpoſed to concede and to accomodate. From the year 1783 to the year 1794, when ſhe apprehended no Commercial Reſtrictions, ſhe ſhewed no diſpoſition to concede or to accommodate. In the year 1794, when alarming evidence was giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en of the danger of Commercial Reſtrictions, ſhe did concede and accommodate.</p>
            <p>If any thing can have weakened the operation of the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings above referred to on the Britiſh government, it muſt be the laboured and vehement attempts of their opponents to ſhow, that the United States had little to demand, and every thing to dread, from Great Britain; that the commerce between the two coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries was more eſſential to us, than to her; that our citizens would be leſs willing than her ſubjects to bear, and our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment leſs able than hers to enforce reſtrictions or interruptions of it. In a word, that we were more dependent on her, than ſhe was on us; and, therefore, ought to court her act to withdraw from us her ſupplies, though chiefly luxuries, inſtead of threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening to withdraw from her our ſupplies, though moſtly neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries.</p>
            <p>It is difficult to ſay, whether the indiſcretion or the fallacy of ſuch arguments be the more remarkable feature in them. All that can be hoped is, that an antidote to their miſchievous ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency in Great Britain may be found in the conſciouſneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the errors on which they are founded, and the contempt which they will be known to have excited in this country.</p>
            <p>2. The other cauſe will be, the poſture into which Europe has been thrown, by the war with France, and particularly by the campaign of 1794. The combined armies have every where felt the ſuperior valour, diſcipline, and reſources of their repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican enemies. Pruſſia, after heavy and perfidious draughts on the Britiſh treaſury, has retired from the common ſtandard, to contend with new dangers peculiar to herſelf. Auſtria, worn out in unavailing reſiſtance, her arms diſgraced, her treaſure exhauſted, and her vaſſals diſcontented, ſeeks her laſt conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the ſame ſource of Britiſh ſubſidy. The Dutch, inſtead of continuing their proportion of aids for the war, have their whole faculties turned over to France. Spain, with all her wealth and all her pride, is palſied in every nerve, and forced to laſt reſorts of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oyalty, to a reduction of ſalaries and penſions, and to the hoards of ſuperſtition. Great Britain herſelf has ſeen her military glory eclipſed, her projects confounded, her hopes blaſted, her marine threatened, her reſources overcharged, and her government in danger of loſing its energy, by the deſpotic excuſes into which it has been overſtrained.</p>
            <p>If, under ſuch circumſtances, ſhe does not abandon herſelf to apathy and deſpair, it is becauſe ſhe finds her credit ſtill alive, and in that credit ſees ſome poſſibility of making terms with misfortune. But what is the baſis of that credit? Her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce.
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:029017_0020_0FDE9642957E03A0"/>
And what is the moſt valuable remnant of that reſource? The commerce with the U. States. Will ſhe riſk this beſt part of her laſt reſource, by perſevering in her ſelfiſh and unjuſt treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the United States?</p>
            <p>Time will give a final anſwer to this queſtion. All that can be now pronounced is, that if, on the awful precipice to which G. Britain is drawn, ſhe will open neither her eyes to her danger, not her heart to her duty, her character muſt be a greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſt to the picture of it drawn by the opponents of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial meaſures, than could have eaſily been imagined. If, on the other hand, ſhe ſhould relent, and conſult her reaſon, the change will be accounted for by her proſpects on the other ſide of the atlantic, and the countenance exhibited on this, without ſuppoſing her character to vary, in a ſingle feature, from the view of it entertained by the friends of ſuch meaſures.</p>
            <p>That the riſing ſpirit of America, and the ſucceſſes of France, will have been the real cauſes of any favorable terms obtained by the miſſion of Mr. Jay, cannot be controverted. Had the ſame ſorbearance, which was tried for ten years on the part of the United States, been continued; and had the combined powers proceeded in the victorious career which has ſignalized the French arms; under this reverſe of circumſtances, the moſt bigotted Engliſhman will be aſhamed to ſay, that any relaxing change in the policy of his government, was to be hoped for by the United States.</p>
            <p>Such are the reflections which occur on the ſuppoſition of a ſucceſsful iſſue to the envoy ſhip. Should it unhappily turn out, that neither the new countenance preſented by America, nor the adverſe fortunes of Great Britain, can bend the latter to a reaſonable accommodation, it may be worth while to enquire, what will probably be the evidence furniſhed by the friends and adverſaries of commercial meaſures, with reſpect to then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative attachments to peace? <note n="*" place="bottom">When this was written, the reſult of Mr. Jay's miſſion was wholly unknown.</note>
            </p>
            <p>If any regard be paid to conſiſtency, thoſe who oppoſed all ſuch meaſures muſt be for an inſtant, reſort to arms. With them there was no alternative, but negociation or war. Their language was, let us try the former, but be prepared for the latter; if the olive branch fail, let the ſword vindicate our rights, as it has vindicated the rights of other nations. A real war is both more honorable and more eligible than commercial regulations. In theſe G. B. is an overmatch for us.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, the friends of commercial meaſures, if conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, will prefer theſe meaſures, as an intermediate experiment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween negociation and war. They will perſiſt in their language, that Great-Britain is more dependent on us, than we are on here that this has ever been the American ſentiment, and is the true baſs of American can policy; that war ſhould not be reſorted to, till every
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:029017_0021_0FDE9644298209A0"/>
thing ſhort of war has been tried; that if Great-Britain be invulner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to our attacks, it is in her fleets and armies; that if the United States bring her to reaſon at all, the ſureſt as well as the cheapeſt means, will be a judicious ſyſtem of commercial operations; that here the United States are unqueſtionably an overmatch for Great-Britain.</p>
            <p>It muſt be the ardent prayer of all, that the occaſion may not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen for ſuch a teſt of the conſiſtency and the diſpoſition of thoſe whoſe counſels were ſo materially different on the ſubject of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial vindication of our rights; ſhould it be otherwiſe ordained, the public juſtice will pronounce on which ſide, the politics were moſt averſe to war, and moſt anxious for every pacific effort, that might at the ſame time be an efficient one, in preference to that laſt and dreadful reſort of injured nations.</p>
            <p>There remains two ſubjects belonging to the ſeſſion of Congreſs under review, on each of which ſome comments are made (proper) by the miſrepreſentations which have been propagated.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, The naval armament.</p>
            <p>The ſecond, The new taxes then eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt, it appears from the debates and other accounts, to have been urged in favor of the meaſure, that ſix frigates of one hundred and eighty four guns, to be ſtationed at the mouth of the Mediterranean, would be ſufficient to protect the American trade againſt the Algerine pirates; that ſuch a force would not coſt more than ſix hundred thouſand dollars, including an out-ſet of ſtores and proviſions for ſix months, and might be built in time to take their ſtation by July or Auguſt laſt; that the expence of this armament would be fully juſtified by the importance of our trade to the ſouth of Europe; that without ſuch a protection, the whole trade of the Atlantic would be expoſed to depredation; nay, that the American coaſt might not eſcape the enterpriſing avarice of theſe roving Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians; that ſuch an effort on the part of the United States, was particularly due to the unfortunate citizens already groaning in chains and pining in deſpair, as well as to thoſe who might otherwiſe be involved in the ſame ſate. Other conſiderations of leſs influence may have entered into the deciſion on the ſame ſide.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, it was ſaid, that the force was inſufficient for the object; that the expence would be greater than was eſtimated; that there was a limit to the expence, which could be afforded for the protection of any branch of trade; that the aggregate value of the annual trade, export and import to Spain and Portugal, appeared from authentic documents not to exceed three and an half millions of dollars, <note n="*" place="bottom">It appears by a late official document, that the amount of the trade ſince that period has conſiderably increaſed in value; but it may be remarked, that in the ſame ratio, the motives to renew the protection, have been ſtrengthened in Portugal and Spain.</note> that the profit only, on this amount, was to be compared with the expence of the frigates; that if the American veſſels engaged in thoſe channels, ſhould give place to veſſels at peace with Algiers,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:029017_0022_0FDE9645B7F7FCD8"/>
they would repair to the channels quitted by the latter veſſels; ſo that it would be rather a change than a loſs of employment; that the other diſtant branches of our trade, would be little affected and our own coaſt not at all; that the frigates, at ſo great a diſtance on a turbulent ſea, would be expoſed to danger, as well as attended with expences, not to be calculated; and it ſtationed where intended, would leave our trade up the Mediterranean as unprotected as it is at preſent. That in addition to theſe conſiderations, the frigates would not be ready by the time ſtated, nor probably until the war, and the occaſion would be over; that if the removal of the Portugueſe ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron from the blockade really proceeded, as was alledged from Great-Britain, ſhe would, under ſome pretext or other, contrive to defeat the object of the frigates; that if Great-Britain was not at the bottom of the meaſure, the intereſt which Portugal had in our trade, which ſupplies her with the neceſſaries of life, would ſoon reſtore the protection ſhe had withdrawn; that it would be more effectual as well as cheaper, to concert arrangements with Portugal, by which the United States would be ſubjected to an equitable ſhare only, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of taking on themſelves the whole of the burden; that as to our unfortunate citizens in captivity, the frigates could neither be in time nor of force, to relieve them; that money alone could do this, and that a ſufficient ſum ought to be provided for the purpoſe: that it was moreover to be conſidered, that if there were any diſpoſition in Great-Britain, to be initiated into a war with us, or to ſeek an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for it; thoſe, who on other queſtions had taken that ground of argument, ought to be particularly aware of danger, from the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſion of naval armaments, within the ſphere of Britiſh jealouſy, and in the way perhaps of a favorite object.</p>
            <p>No undue blame is meant to be thrown on thoſe, who did not yield to this reaſoning, however concluſive it may now appear.—The vote in favor of the meaſure was indeed ſo checquered, that it cannot even be attributed to the influence of party. It is but juſtice at the ſame time, to thoſe who oppoſed the meaſure, to remark, that inſtead of the frigates being at their deſtined ſtation in July or Auguſt laſt, the keel of one only was laid in December; the timber for the reſt being then in the foreſt, and the whole of the preſent year ſtat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be neceſſary for their completion; that conſequently it is near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly certain now, they will not be in ſervice, before the war in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope will be over, <note n="*" place="bottom">It may be added, that the original eſtimate and appropriation for the annual ſupport of the frigates, was two hundred and forty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeven thouſand, nine hundred dollars only; whereas the ſum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at the laſt ſeſſion, by the Secretary of War, for ſix months ſupport, in the year 1795, is two hundred twenty-four thouſand ſeven hundred and fifty-four dollars; making the annual ſupport four hundred forty-nine thouſand, five hundred and eight dollars.</note> and that in the mean time it has turned out as it was foretold, that Portugal has felt ſufficient motives to renew the blockade; ſo that if the frigates had been adapted to the origin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al object, they would not be required for it, more eſpecially, as it
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:029017_0023_0FDE9650B6D32FD0"/>
his likewiſe turned out according to another anticipation, that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney would alone be the agent for reſtoring the captive exiles to their freedom and their country.</p>
            <p>It may poſſibly be ſaid, that the frigates, though not neceſſary or proper for the ſervice firſt contemplated, may uſefully be applied to the ſecurity of our coaſts, againſt Pirates, Privateers, and Smugglers. This is a diſtinct queſtion. The ſole and avowed object of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val armament was the protection of our trade againſt the Algerines. To that object the force is appropriated by the law itſelf. The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident can apply it to no other: If any other now preſents itſelf, it may fairly be now diſcuſſed, but as it was not the object then, the meaſure cannot be teſted by it now. If there be ſufficient reaſons of any ſort for ſuch a naval eſtabliſhment, thoſe who diſapproved it for an impracticable and impolitic object, may with perfect conſiſtency allow theſe reaſons their full weight. It is much to be queſtioned, however, whether any good reaſon could be found for going on with the whole undertaking; beſides, that in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral the commencement of political meaſures under one pretext, and the proſecution of them under another, has always an aſpect, that juſtifies circumſpection if not ſuſpicion.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the new taxes, the ſecond remaining ſubject, a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry brief explanation will be ſufficient.</p>
            <p>From a general view of the proceedings of Congreſs on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, it appears, that the advocates for the new taxes urged them. 1ſt. On the probability of a diminution of the import for 1794, as an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of ſome of the queſtions agitated in Congreſs on the amount of exports from Great Britain to the United States. 2dly. On the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of war with Great Britain, which would ſtill further deſtroy the revenue, at the ſame time that it would beget an immenſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to the public expenditures. On the firſt of theſe points, thoſe who did not concur in the new taxes, at leaſt in all of them, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the probability of any material diminution of the import with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a war: On the other point, they denied any ſuch probability of a war, as to require what was propoſed; and in both theſe opinions, they have been juſtified by ſubſequent experience. War has not taken place, nor does it appear never to have been meditated, unleſs in the ſubverting the French Republic, which was never probable, whilſt the revenue from the import, inſtead of being diminiſhed, has very conſiderably exceed any former amount.</p>
            <p>It will not be improper to remark, as a further elucidation of this ſubject. 1ſt. That moſt, if not all, who refuſed to concur in ſome of the new taxes as not juſtified by the occaſion, actually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred in others which were leaſt objectionable, as an accommodat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing precaution againſt contingencies. 2d. That the objection to one or the taxes was its breach of the conſtitution; an objection in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaperable in its nature, and which there is reaſon to believe, will be eſtabliſhed by the judicial authority, if ever brought to that teſt; and that the objections to others were ſuch as had always had weight with the moſt enlightened patriots of America. 3. That in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the moſt zealous patrons of new Ways and Means, the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:029017_0024_0FDE965310B129B0"/>
critical as they preſſed it, did not ultimately juſtify all the taxes propoſed. It appears in particular, that a bill impoſing a vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of duties, moſtly in the nature of ſtamp duties, into which, a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on transfers of ſtock, had been inſerted as an amendment, was the laſt ſtage defeated, by thoſe who had in general, urged the new taxes and this very bill itſelf in the earlier ſtage of it.</p>
            <p>Theſe, with the preceding observations, on a very intereſting pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of Congreſſional hiſtory, will be left to the candid judgement of the public. Such as may not before have viewed the tranſaction of that period, through any other medium than the miſrepreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which have been circulated, will have an opportunity of doin juſtice to themſelves, as well as to others. And no doubt can be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained, that in this as in all other caſes, it will be found, that truth ſtifled or perverted for a time, will finally triumph in the detection of calumny, and in the contempt which awaits its authors.</p>
