            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>The committee appointed on the intereſting concern for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the welfare of the Indian Natives—Report, that at ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral meetings in which we have had the company of divers concerned brethren not particularly named to the ſervice; we have deliberately conſidered this important ſubject, which hath for a ſeries of years deeply exerciſed the minds of many friends, and been latterly revived in the yearly meeting with increaſing weight—Our minds have been meaſurably drawn into ſympathy with theſe diſtreſſed inhabitants of the wilderneſs, and on comparing their ſituation with our own, and calling to grateful remembrance the kindneſs of their predeceſſors to ours in the early ſettlement of this country; conſidering alſo our profeſſed principles of peace and goodwill to men, we were in-induced with much unanimity to believe, that there are loud calls for our benevolence and charitable exertions to promote amongſt them the principles of the Chriſtian religion, as well as to turn their attention to ſchool learning, agriculture, and uſeful me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanic employments, eſpecially as there appears in ſome of the tribes, a willingneſs to unite in the exerciſe of endeavours of this kind—We believe that this end may be much promoted under the Divine Bleſſing, by a recommendation from this meeting to the ſeveral quarterly meetings, that a liberal ſubſcription be ſet on foot and a fund raiſed, to be under the direction of a ſpecial committee to be appointed by the yearly meeting, in order that theſe pious purpoſes may be carried into effect as ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as practicable, and the apparent friendly diſpoſition of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment towards this deſirable object improved.—And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that this ſubject is of ſufficient magnitude to claim the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of our religious ſociety in different parts of this conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, we think it may be uſeful to hint the ſubſtance of this concern in the Epiſtles to the reſpective yearly meetings.</p>

            <head>At a meeting of the ſaid Committee in Philadelphia, on the <hi>3</hi>rd of the <hi>11</hi>th Month <hi>1795,</hi> the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Epiſtle was directed to the Quarterly and Monthly Meetings belonging to the ſaid Yearly Meeting.</head>
            <p>The committee appointed by the yearly meeting to attend to the growing concern for the welfare of our Indian Brethren, have ſeriouſly conſidered the important truſt devolved upon them, the proſecution of which will evidently require prudence, patience and perſeverance, its ultimate object, under the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Bleſſing being no leſs than the temporal and ſpiritual welfare of ſome thouſands of our fellow men, and their poſterity.</p>
            <p>Difficulties however ſhould not diſcourage us from the exerciſe of our chriſtian duty toward theſe people, when we call to mind that they were the original inhabitants of this land, and that they kindly received and made room for our forefathers, when <hi>they</hi> were ſtrangers in it; eſpecially as <hi>we</hi> are ſettled upon the ſea coaſts, and parts adjacent, enjoying, through the bounty of Providence, an abundance of temporal bleſſings, where <hi>they</hi> once lived in eaſe and plenty, but are <hi>now</hi> wandering from hill to hill, ſcarcely able to find ſubſiſtence in their former way of life—Circumſtances which loudly call for our brotherly aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to put them in a way to ſupport themſelves by Agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and handicrafts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:028715_0005_0FD9BCA81063E470"/>It is hoped that ſome ſober well qualified friends will be drawn to unite with the Concern ſo far as to go among them for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of inſtructing them in huſbandry, and uſeful trades; and teaching their children neceſſary learning, that they may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Scriptures of truth, improve in the principles of Chriſtianity, and become qualified to manage temporal concerns— and it is expected that the committee will find it expedient to erect Griſt and Saw Mills, Smith's ſhops and other neceſſary im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements in ſome of their villages.

            <p>The preſent appears to us a favourable period for carrying on this good work—the boundaries of ſome of the tribes are fixed by treaty—their lands cannot now be ſo eaſily alienated as hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and evil communication with traders and others is intended to be prevented by Government, whoſe conſent and approbation of the meaſures propoſed has been already expreſſed.</p>
            <p>We have appointed John Elliott our treaſurer, who is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the collections that may be made in the ſeveral monthly meetings for theſe benevolent purpoſes.</p>
            <p>To ſpread before friends ſome information of the preſent opening for uſefulneſs, the following ſpeeches of ſome of their chiefs, and extracts of letters from others who have been taught to read and write, are ſelected from a conſiderable number which ſpeak the ſame language, from different tribes.</p>

He is very old and feeble and he wonders at his own ſhadow it is become ſo little. He has no children to take care of him, and the game is driven away by the white people, ſo that the young men muſt hunt all day long to find game for themſelves to eat; they have nothing left for Gayaſhuta. And it is not Gayaſhuta only, who is become old and feeble, there yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main about thirty men of your old friends, who, unable to

If you would then my petition is to you and your Friends, to put ſtove in this houſe and we will put fire on it, then the houſe will be warm without getting great deal of wood.

My friend this is moſt acceptable offer, and I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted by my people to deſire you to ſend ſome implements of huſbandry to fort Schuyler on Mohawk river to John Poſts, who would take care of the ſame until we fetch them. The hoes are moſt wanting among us, alſo two or three plows, chain and ſcythes, and axes, and harrow tooth—theſe articles are very ſcarce here in wilderneſs—if we could get ſuch we can then go on with our ſpring work. Reſpecting books—ſpelling books and primmers are neceſſary—for there are about forty ſmall children

who would uſe the ſmall books—but the big children have got ſome books to read from other quarter.</p>

            <p>My friends have thought that if we could hire fifty dollars from our friends we could make out—and they deſire me to mention it to you—My friend I only mention this to you that you may know our ſituation—and if you find it you could lent us ſo much without harm to your minds, we will replaced next winter, there is annual ſum come in to this nation out of which we can replace your money.—</p>
