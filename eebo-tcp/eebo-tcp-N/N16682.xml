            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AN earneſt deſire of improving this Selection as much as poſſible, has engaged the Compiler to make conſiderable alterations upon it in every ſucceeding im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; and in none more than the preſent. For theſe liberties he hopes to be forgiven; eſpecially as they have been the means of giving it at laſt a degree of excellence, which, he flatters himſelf, will render it highly acceptable to every perſon of taſte. To prevent, however, the inconveniences which might attend the varying of it ſo much in future editions, it is determined to allow it, henceforward, to remain the ſame, or nearly the ſame, as it is now preſented to the Public.—Of the general plan and manner of uſing it, the following is a ſhort account.</p>
            <p>PART I. is calculated to form the accurate and poliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Reader. It is divided into eight ſections; five in Proſe, and three in Verſe. For ſeveral reaſons, it was thought proper to preſerve the poetical pieces entirely diſtinct from the proſaic; but, in teaching, it will, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, be preferable to take the ſections in the order— One, Two, Three, Six, Four, Seven, Five, Eight: by which method, the learner will be well exerciſed in the reading of Proſe before entering upon that of Verſe; and will, afterwards, read a ſection of the latter kind and one of the former alternately, till this Part be finiſhed.</p>
            <p>PART II. may be read with no leſs propriety than the preceding, by pupils of every denomination; but is particularly adapted for ſuch as may have occaſion to ſpeak in public. This part is divided into five ſections; the firſt three, exhibiting ſpecimens of eloquence ſuited reſpectively, to the Pulpit, the Senate, and the Bar; the fourth, Speeches delivered on various occaſions; the fifth, Dramatic pieces. Theſe may be gone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly through by every ſtudent; though, where a particular ſpecies of delivery is in view, one ſection will deſerve to be longer dwelt upon than another, as is
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:021451_0003_0FB3F605208662B0"/>
manifeſt from their titles.—It need hardly be obſerved, that frequent reading in a ſtanding poſture, and recita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation without book, are eſſentially neceſſary in form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Public Speaker, and extremely proper for youth in general.</p>
            <p>IN the Appendix is given a courſe of Leſſons on an original plan, by which the Compiler has long taught with uncommon ſucceſs. In particular caſes, theſe may be read wholly through, as an introduction to pieces of greater length and of a more mixed nature; but, in general, it will anſwer better to make a few of them a part of each day's reading, repeating them in the ſame manner as often as may be thought neceſſary. As they exemplify particulars which enter into, and form almoſt the whole of compoſition, it is evident the ſtudy of them muſt be highly advantageous.</p>
            <p>By caſting the eye along the table of contents, the variety and merit of the pieces contained in this volume will appear in a ſtriking light. Almoſt every emotion of the ſoul, and every mode of expreſſion, will here be called forth into exerciſe; while, at the ſame time, the pupil will be made acquainted with the beſt authors, and, by the frequent peru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſte for correct and elegant wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. As a further recommendation of the work, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will be found in it which can in the ſmalleſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree be offenſive to delicacy or hurtful to moral: on the contrary, every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>MAN's chief good is an upright mind; which no earthly power can beſtow, nor take from him.</p>
                     <p>We ought to diſtruſt our paſſions, even when they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear the moſt reaſonable.</p>
                     <p>It is idle, as well as abſurd, to impoſe our opinions upon others. The ſame ground of conviction operates differently on the ſame man in different circumſtances, and on different men in the ſame circumſtances.</p>
                     <p>Chooſe what is moſt fit; cuſtom will make it the moſt agreeable.</p>
                     <p>A cheerful countenance betokens an good heart.</p>
                     <p>Hypocriſy is an homage that vice pays to virtue.</p>
                     <p>Anxiety and conſtraint are the conſtant attendants of pride.</p>
                     <p>Men make themſelves ridiculous, not ſo much by the qualities they have, as by the affectation of thoſe they have not.</p>
                     <p>Nothing blunts the edge of ridicule ſo effectually as good humor.</p>
                     <p>To ſay little and perform much, is the characteriſtic of a great mind.</p>
                     <p>A man who gives his children a habit of induſtry, provides for them better than by giving them a ſtock of money.</p>

                     <p>The young are ſlaves to novelty, the old to cuſtom.</p>
                     <p>No preacher is ſo ſucceſsful as time. It gives a turn of thought to the aged, which it was impoſſible to inſpire while they were young.</p>
                     <p>Every man, however little, makes a figure in his own eyes.</p>
                     <p>Self-partiality hides from us thoſe very faults in our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves which we ſee and blame in others.</p>
                     <p>The injuries we do, and thoſe we ſuffer are ſeldom weighed in the ſame balance.</p>
                     <p>Men generally put a greater value upon the favors they beſtow, than upon thoſe they receive.</p>
                     <p>He who is puffed up with the firſt gale of proſperity, will bend beneath the firſt blaſt of adverſity.</p>
                     <p>Adverſity borrows its ſharpeſt ſting from our impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</p>
                     <p>Men commonly owe their virtue or their vice to edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation as much as to nature.</p>
                     <p>There is no ſuch fop as my young maſter of his lady-mother's making. She blows him up with ſelf-conceit, and there he ſtops. She makes a man of him at twelve, and a boy all his life after.</p>
                     <p>An infallible way to make your child miſerable, is to ſatisfy all his demands. Paſſion ſwells by gratification; and the impoſſibility of ſatisfying every one of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, will oblige you to ſtop ſhort at laſt, after he has become headſtrong.</p>

                     <p>WE eſteem moſt things according to their intrinſic merit: it is ſtrange MAN ſhould be an exception. We prize a horſe for his ſtrength and courage, not for his fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture. We prize a man for his ſumptuous palace, his great train, his vaſt revenue; yet theſe are his furniture, not his mind.</p>
                     <p>The true conveniences of life are common to the king, with his meaneſt ſubject. The king's ſleep is not ſweeter, nor his appetite better.</p>

Give a prince all the names of majeſty that are found in a folio dictionary, the firſt attack of the gout will make him forget his palace and his guards. If he be in choler, will his princedom prevent him from turning pale, and gnaſhing his teeth like a fool? The ſmalleſt prick of a nail, the ſlighteſt paſſion of the ſoul, is capable of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering inſipid the monarchy of the world.</p>

                     <p>Thoſe who are the moſt faulty, are the moſt prone to find faults in others.</p>
                     <p>The firſt and moſt important female quality is ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of temper. Heaven did not give to the female ſex inſinuation and perſuaſion, in order to be ſurly: it did not make them weak, in order to be imperious: it did not give them a ſweet voice, in order to be employed in ſcolding: it did not provide them with delicate features, in order to be disfigured with anger.</p>
                     <p>Let fame be regarded, but conſcience much more. It is an empty joy to appear better than you are; but a great bleſſing to be what you ought to be.</p>
                     <p>Let your conduct be the reſult of deliberation, never of impatience.</p>
                     <p>In the conduct of life, let it be one great aim, to ſhow that every thing you do proceeds from yourſelf, not from your paſſions. Chryſippus rewards in joy, chaſtiſes in wrath, doth every thing in paſſion. No perſon ſtands in awe of Chryſippus, no perſon is grateful to him. Why? becauſe it is not Chryſippus who acts, but his paſſions. We ſhun him in wrath as we ſhun a wild beaſt; and this is all the authority he hath over us.</p>
                     <p>Indulge not deſire at the expence of the ſlighteſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of virtue: paſs once its limits, and you fall head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into vice.</p>
                     <p>Examine well the counſel that favors your deſires.</p>
                     <p>The gratification of deſire is ſometimes the worſt thing that can befal us.</p>

                     <p>A word dropt by chance from your friend offends your delicacy. Avoid a haſty reply; and beware of opening your diſcontent to the firſt perſon you meet. When you are cool, it will vaniſh, and leave no impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                     <p>The moſt profitable revenge, the moſt rational, and the moſt pleaſant, is to make it the intereſt of the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious perſon not to hurt you a ſecond time.</p>
                     <p>It was a ſaying of Socrates, that we ſhould eat and drink in order to live; inſtead of living, as many do, in order to eat and drink.</p>
                     <p>Be moderate in your pleaſures, that your reliſh for them may continue.</p>
                     <p>Time is requiſite to bring great projects to maturity. Precipitation ruins the beſt contrived plan; patience ripens the moſt difficult.</p>
                     <p>When we ſum up the miſeries of life, the grief be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on trifles makes a great part of the account; trifles which, neglected, are nothing. How ſhameful ſuch a weakneſs!</p>
                     <p>The penſionary De Wit being aſked how he could tranſact ſuch variety of buſineſs without confuſion, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, That he never did but one thing at a time.</p>
                     <p>Guard your weak ſide from being known. If it be attacked, the beſt way is to join in the attack.</p>
                     <p>Francis I. conſulting with his generals how to lead his army over the Alps into Italy, Amarel his fool ſprung from a corner, and adviſed him to conſult rather how to bring it back.</p>
                     <p>The beſt practical rule of morality is, Never to do but what you are willing all the world ſhould know.</p>
                     <p>Solicitude in hiding failings make them appear the greater. It is a ſafer and eaſier courſe frankly to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge them. A man owns that he is ignorant: we admire his modeſty. He ſays he is old: we ſcarce think him ſo. He declares himſelf poor: we do not believe it.</p>
                     <p>When you diſcant on the faults of others, conſider

whether you be not guilty of the ſame. To gain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ourſelves, the beſt way is to convert the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of others into a mirror for diſcovering our own.</p>
                     <p>Apply yourſelf more to acquire knowledge than to ſhow it. Men commonly take great pains to put off the little ſtock they have; but they take little pains to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire more.</p>
                     <p>Never ſuffer your courage to be fierce, your reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion obſtinate, your wiſdom cunning, nor your patience ſullen.</p>
                     <p>To meaſure all reaſon by our own, is a plain act of injuſtice: it is an encroachment on the common rights of mankind.</p>
                     <p>If you would teach ſecreſy to others, begin with yourſelf. How can you expect another will keep your ſecret, when you yourſelf cannot?</p>
                     <p>A man's fortune is more frequently made by his tongue than by his virtues; and more frequently cruſhed by it than by his vices.</p>

The Stork thruſt in her long bill, and helped herſelf very plentifully; then, turning to Reynard, who was eagerly licking the outſide of a jar where ſome ſauce had been ſpilled—I am very glad, ſaid ſhe; ſmiling, that you ſeem to have ſo good an appetite; I hope you will make as hearty a dinner at my table as I did the

<pb n="23" facs="unknown:021451_0022_0FB3F6219DBFD458"/>
ſpread before them; the one loading his thigh at inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals with proviſions for the hive againſt the diſtant win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; the other revelling in ſweets, without regard to any thing but his preſent gratification. At length they found a wide-mouthed phial, that hung beneath the bough of a peach-tree, filled with honey ready temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and expoſed to their taſte in the moſt alluring man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. The thoughtleſs epicure, ſpite of all his friend's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances, plunged headlong into the veſſel, reſolving to indulge himſelf in all the pleaſures of ſenſuality. The philoſopher, on the other hand, ſipped a little with cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but, being ſuſpicious of danger, flew off to fruits and flowers; where, by the moderation of his meals, he improved his reliſh for the true enjoyment of them. In the evening, however, he called upon his friend, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire whether he would return to the hive; but found him ſurfeited in ſweets, which he was as unable to leave as to enjoy. Clogged in his wings, enfeebled in his feet, and his whole frame totally enervated, he was but juſt able to bid his friend adieu, and to lament with his lateſt breath, that though a taſte of pleaſure might quicken the reliſh of life, an unreſtrained indulgence is inevitable deſtruction.</p>

                  <p>DAMON and Pythias, of the Pythagorean ſect in philoſophy, lived in the time of Dionyſius the tyrant of Sicily. Their mutual friendſhip was ſo ſtrong, that they were ready to die for one another. One of the two (for it is not known which) being condemned to death by the tyrant, obtained leave to go into his own country to ſettle his affairs, on condition that the other ſhould conſent to be impriſoned in his ſtead, and put to death for him, if be did not return before the day of execution. The attention of every one, and eſpecially of the tyrant himſelf, was excited to the higheſt pitch, as every body was curious to ſee what ſhould be the event of ſo ſtrange an affair. When the time was almoſt clapſed, and he who was gone did not appear, the raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the other, whoſe ſanguine friendſhip had put him upon running ſo ſeemingly deſperate a hazard, was univerſally blamed.

                  <p>DIONYSIUS, the tyrant of Sicily, ſhowed how far he was from being happy, even whilſt he abounded in riches, and all the pleaſures which riches can procure. Damocles, one of his flatterers, was complimenting him upon his power, his treaſures, and the magnificence of his royal ſtate, and affirming that no monarch ever was greater or happier than he. "Have you a mind, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocles," ſays the king, "to taſte this happineſs, and know by experience what my enjoyments are, of which you have ſo high an idea?" Damocles gladly accepted the offer. Upon which the king ordered, that a royal banquet ſhould be prepared, and a gilded couch placed for him, covered with rich embroidery, and ſide-boards loaded with gold and ſilver plate of immenſe value. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of extraordinary beauty were ordered to wait on him at table, and to obey his commands with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt readineſs and the moſt profound ſubmiſſion. Neither ointments, chaplets of flowers, nor rich perfumes were wanting. The table was loaded with the moſt exquiſite delicacies of every kind. Damocles fancied himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the gods. In the midſt of all his happineſs, he ſees let down from the roof, exactly over his neck, as he lay indulging himſelf in ſtate, a glittering ſword hung by a ſingle hair. The ſight of deſtruction thus threatening him from on high, ſoon put a ſtop to his joy and revelling. The pomp of his attendance, and the glitter of the carved plate, gave him no longer any pleaſure. He dreads to ſtretch forth his hand to the table; he throws off the chaplet of roſes; he haſtens to remove from his dangerous ſituation; and at laſt begs the king to reſtore him to his former humble condition, having no deſire to enjoy any longer ſuch a dreadful kind of happineſs.</p>

                  <head>XVII. CHARACTER OF CATILINE.</head>
                  <p>LUCIUS CATILINE, by birth a Patrician, was by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture endowed with ſuperior advantages both bodily and mental; but his diſpoſitions were corrupt and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. From his youth, his ſupreme delight was in vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, ſlaughter, rapine, and inteſtine confuſions; and ſuch works were the employment of his earlieſt years. His conſtitution qualified him for bearing hunger, cold, and want of ſleep, to a degree exceeding belief. His mind was daring, ſubtle, unſteady. There was no cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter which he could not aſſume and put off at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Rapacious of what belonged to others, prodigal of his own, violently bent on whatever became the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his purſuit. He poſſeſſed a conſiderable ſhare of eloquence, but little ſolid knowledge. His inſatiable temper was ever puſhing him to graſp at what was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate, romantic, and out of his reach.</p>
                  <p>About the time of the diſturbances raiſed by Sylla, Catiline was ſeized with a violent luſt of power; nor did he at all heſitate about the means, ſo he could but at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his purpoſe of raiſing himſelf to ſupreme dominion. His reſtleſs ſpirit was in a continual ferment, occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the confuſion of his own private affairs, and by the horrors of his guilty conſcience; both which he had brought upon himſelf by living the life above deſcribed. He was encouraged in his ambitious projects by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral corruption of manners which then prevailed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt a people infected with two vices, not leſs oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to one another in their natures than miſchievous in their tendencies; I mean, Luxury and Avarice.</p>

                  <head>XVIII. AVARICE AND LUXURY.</head>
                  <p>THERE were two very powerful tyrants engaged in a perpetual war againſt each other: the name of the firſt was Luxury, and of the ſecond Avarice. The aim of each of them was no leſs than univerſal monarchy over the hearts of mankind. Luxury had many gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erals under him, who did him great ſervice; as Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, Mirth, Pomp, and Faſhion. Avarice was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe very ſtrong in his officers, being faithfully ſerved by Hunger, Induſtry, Care, and Watchfulneſs: he had
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:021451_0026_0FB3F6291F8C4370"/>
likewiſe a privy-counſellor who was always at his elbow, and whiſpering ſomething or other in his ear: the name of this privy-counſellor was Poverty. As Avarice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted himſelf by the counſels of Poverty, his antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt was entirely guided by the dictates and advice of Plenty, who was his firſt counſellor and miniſter of ſtate, that concerted all his meaſures for him, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver departed out of his ſight. While theſe two great rivals were thus contending for empire, their conqueſts were very various. Luxury got poſſeſſion of one heart, and Avarice of another. The father of a family would often range himſelf under the banners of Avarice, and the ſon under thoſe of Luxury. The wife and huſband would often declare themſelves on the two different parties; nay, the ſame perſon would very often ſide with one in his youth, and revolt to the other in his old age. Indeed the wiſe men of the world ſtood neuter; but, alas! their numbers were not conſiderable. At length, when theſe two potentates had wearied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with waging war upon one another, they agreed upon an interview, at which neither of their counſellors were to be preſent. It is ſaid that Luxury began the parley; and, after having repreſented the endleſs ſtate of war in which they were engaged, told his enemy, with a frankneſs of heart which is natural to him, that he believed they two ſhould be very good friends, were it not for the inſtigations of Poverty, that pernicious counſellor, who made an ill uſe of his ear, and filled him with groundleſs apprehenſions and prejudices. To this Avarice replied, that he looked upon Plenty (the firſt miniſter of his antagoniſt) to be a much more deſtructive counſellor than Poverty; for that he was perpetually ſuggeſting pleaſures, baniſhing all the neceſſary cautions againſt want, and, conſequently, undermining thoſe principles on which the government of Avarice was founded. At laſt, in order to an accommodation, they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon this preliminary; that each of them ſhould immediately diſmiſs his privy-counſellor. When things were thus far adjuſted towards a peace, all other dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences were ſoon accommodated; inſomuch that for the future they reſolved to live as good friends and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, and to ſhare between them whatever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:021451_0027_0FB3F62B1A5E8CA0"/>
were made on either ſide. For this reaſon, we now find Luxury and Avarice taking poſſeſſion of the ſame heart, and dividing the ſame perſon between them. To which I ſhall only add, that ſince the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carding of the counſellors above mentioned, Avarice ſupplies Luxury in the room of Plenty, as Luxury prompts Avarice in the place of Poverty.</p>

                  <p>WHEN Hercules was in that part of his youth in which it was natural for him to conſider what courſe of life he ought to purſue, he one day retired into a deſert, where the ſilence and ſolitude of the place very much favored his meditations. As he was muſing on his preſent condition, and very much perplexed in himſelf on the ſtate of life he ſhould chooſe, he ſaw two women of a larger ſtature than ordinary approaching towards him. One of them had a very noble air and graceful deportment; her beauty was natural and eaſy, her perſon clean and unſpotted, her eyes caſt towards the ground with an agreeable reſerve, her motion and behavior full of modeſty, and her raiment as white as ſnow. The other had a great deal of health and flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridneſs in her countenance, which ſhe had helped with an artificial white and red; and ſhe endeavored to appear more graceful than ordinary in her mien, by a mixture of affectation in all her geſtures. She had a wonderful confidence and aſſurance in her looks, and all the variety of colours in her dreſs that ſhe thought were the moſt proper to ſhew her complexion to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. She caſt her eyes upon herſelf, then turned them on thoſe that were preſent, to ſee how they liked her; and often looked on the figure ſhe made in her own ſhadow. Upon her nearer approach to Hercules, ſhe ſtepped before the other lady, who came forward with a regular compoſed carriage; and, running up to him, accoſted him after the following manner:</p>
                  <p>"My dear Hercules," ſays ſhe, "I find you are very much divided in your thoughts upon the way of life that you ought to chooſe: be my friend, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me; I will lead you into the poſſeſſion of pleaſure, and o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="29" facs="unknown:021451_0028_0FB3F62C1E18FC90"/>
the noiſe and diſquietude of buſineſs. The affairs of either war or peace ſhall have no power to diſturb you. Your whole employment ſhall be to make your life ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, and to entertain every ſenſe with its proper gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations. Sumptuous tables, beds of roſes, clouds of perfumes, concerts of muſic, crowds of beauties, are all in readineſs to receive you. Come along with me into this region of delights, this world of pleaſure, and bid farewel for ever to care, to pain, to buſineſs."</p>
                  <p>Hercules, hearing the lady talk after this manner, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to know her name; to which ſhe anſwered, "My friends, and thoſe who are well acquainted with me, call me Happineſs; but my enemies, and thoſe who would injure my reputation, have given me the name of Pleaſure."</p>
                  <p>By this time the other lady was come up, who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed herſelf to the young hero in a very different manner.</p>
                  <p>"Hercules," ſays ſhe, "I offer myſelf to you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I know your are deſcended from the gods, and give proofs of that deſcent by your love to virtue, and application to the ſtudies proper for your age. This makes me hope you will gain, both for yourſelf and me, an immortal reputation. But, before I invite you into my ſociety and friendſhip, I will be open and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere with you, and muſt lay down this as an eſtabliſhed truth, that there is nothing truly valuable which can be purchaſed without pains and labor. The gods have ſet a price upon every real and noble pleaſure. If you would gain the favor of the Deity, you muſt be at the pains of worſhipping him; if the friendſhip of good men, you muſt ſtudy to oblige them; if you would be honored by your country, you muſt take care to ſerve it. In ſhort, if you would be eminent in war or peace, you muſt become maſter of all the qualifications that can make you ſo. Theſe are the only terms and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon which I can propoſe happineſs." The god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs of Pleaſure here broke in upon her diſcourſe: "You ſee," ſaid ſhe, "Hercules, by her own confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the way to her pleaſures is long and difficult; whereas that which I propoſe is ſhort and eaſy." "A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las." ſaid the other lady, whoſe viſage glowed with
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:021451_0029_0FB3F62D9F147F48"/>
paſſion, made up of ſcorn and pity, "what are the pleaſures you propoſe? To eat before you are hungry, drink before you are athriſt, ſleep before your are tired; to gratify appetites before they are raiſed, and raiſe ſuch appetites as nature never planted. You never heard the moſt delicious muſic, which is the praiſe of one's ſelf; nor ſaw the moſt beautiful object, which is the work of one's own hands. Your votaries paſs away their youth in a dream of miſtaken pleaſures, while they are hoarding up anguiſh, torment, and remorſe, for old age.</p>
                  <p>"As for me, I am the friend of gods and of good men, an agreeable companion to the artizan, an houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold guardian to the fathers of families, a patron and protector of ſervants, an aſſociate in all true and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous friendſhips. The banquets of my votaries are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver coſtly, but always delicious; for none eat and drink at them who are not invited by hunger and thirſt. Their ſlumbers are ſound, and their wakings cheerful. My young men have the pleaſure of hearing themſelves praiſed by thoſe who are in years; and thoſe who are in years, of being honored by thoſe who are young. In a word, my followers are favored by the gods, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved by their acquaintance, eſteemed by their country, and, after the cloſe of their labors, honored by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity."</p>

A gentleman, who was advocate for the ladies, took this occaſion to tell us the ſtory of a famous ſiege in Germany; which I have ſince found re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in my hiſtorical dictionary after the following manner. When the Emperor Conrade III. had beſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Guelphus, Duke of Bavaria, in the city of Henſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg, the women, finding that the town could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly hold out long, petitioned the Emperor that they might depart out of it with ſo much as each of them could carry. The Emperor, knowing they could not convey away many of their effects, granted them their petition; when the women, to his great ſurpriſe, came out of the place with every one her huſband upon her back. The Emperor was ſo moved at the ſight, that he burſt into tears; and after having very much extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the women for their conjugal affection, gave the men to their wives, and received the Duke into his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor.</p>
                        <p>"The ladies did not a little triumph at this ſtory; aſking us at the ſame time, whether in our conſciences we believed that the men in any town of Great Britain would, upon the ſame offer, and at the ſame conjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, have loaded themſelves with their wives? or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whether they would not have been glad of ſuch an opportunity to get rid of them? To this my very good friend Tom Dapperwit, who took upon him to be the mouth of our ſex, replied, that they would be very much to blame if they would not do the ſame good of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for the women, conſidering that their ſtrength would be greater, and their burdens lighter.

                        <p>"I ſaw a town of this iſland, which ſhall be name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, inveſted on every ſide, and the inhabitants of it ſo ſtraitened as to cry for quarter. The general refuſed any other terms than thoſe granted to the above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned town of Henſberg, namely, that the married wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men might come out with what they could bring along with them. Immediately the city gates flew open, and a female proceſſion appeared, multitudes of the ſex fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing one another in a row, and ſtaggering under their reſpective burdens. I took my ſtand upon an eminence in the enemy's camp, which was appointed for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rendezvous of theſe female carriers, being very deſirous to look into their ſeveral ladings. The firſt of them had a huge ſack upon her ſhoulders, which ſhe ſet down with great care: upon the opening of it, when I expected to have ſeen her huſband ſhot out of it, I found it was filled with china-ware. The next appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a more decent figure, carrying a handſome young fellow upon her back: I could not forbear commending the young woman for her conjugal affection, when to my great ſurpriſe, I found that ſhe had left the good man at home, and brought away her gallant. I ſaw the third, at ſome diſtance, with a little withered face peeping over her ſhoulder, whom I could not ſuſpect for any but her ſpouſe, till, upon her ſetting him down, I heard her call him dear pug, and found him to be her favorite monkey. A fourth brought a huge bale of cards along with her; and the fifth a Bologna lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dog; for her huſband, it ſeems, being a very bulky man, ſhe thought it would be leſs trouble for her to bring away little cupid. The next was the wife of a rich uſerer loaden with a bag of gold; ſhe told us that her ſpouſe was very old, and by the courſe of nature could not expect to live long; and that to ſhow her tender regard for him, ſhe had ſaved that which the

All the place about me was covered with packs of ribbands, brocades, embroidery, and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand other materials, ſufficient to have furniſhed a whole ſtreet of toy-ſhops. One of the women, having an huſband who was none of the heavieſt, was bringing him off upon her ſhoulders, at the ſame time that ſhe carried a great bundle of Flanders lace under her arm; but finding herſelf ſo overloaden that ſhe could not ſave both of them, ſhe dropped the good man, and brought away the bundle.

                  <head>XXI. ON GOOD BREEDING.</head>
                  <p>A FRIEND of yours and mine has very juſtly defined good breeding to be, "the reſult of much good ſenſe, ſome good nature, and a little ſelf-denial for the ſake of others, and with a view to obtain the ſame indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence from them." Taking this for granted, (as I think it cannot be diſputed) it is aſtoniſhing to me, that any body, who has good ſenſe and good nature, can eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially fail in good breeding. As to the modes of it, indeed, they vary according to perſons, places, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and are only to be acquired by obſervation and experience; but the ſubſtance of it is every where and eternally the ſame. Good manners are, to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſocieties, what good morals are to ſociety in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; their cement, and their ſecurity. And, as laws are enacted to enforce good morals, or at leaſt to prevent the ill effects of bad ones; ſo there are certain rules of civility, univerſally implied and received, to enforce good manners and puniſh bad ones. And, indeed, there ſeems to me to be leſs difference, both between the crimes and puniſhments, than at firſt one would imagine. The immoral man, who invades another's property, is juſtly hanged for it; and the ill-bred man, who, by his ill manners, invades and diſturbs the quiet and comforts of private life, is by common conſent as juſtly baniſhed ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. Mutual complaiſances, attentions, and ſacrifices of little conveniences, are as natural an implied compact between civilized people, as protection and obedience are between kings and ſubjects; whoever, in either caſe, violates that compact, juſtly forfeits all advantages ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from it. For my own part, I really think that, next to the conſciouſneſs of doing a good action, that of doing a civil one is the moſt pleaſing: and the epithet which I ſhould covet the moſt, next to to that of Ariſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, would be that of well-bred. Thus much for good-breeding in general: I will now conſider ſome of the various modes and degrees of it.</p>
                  <p>Very few, ſcarcely any, are wanting in the reſpect which they ſhould ſhow to thoſe whom they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:021451_0034_0FB3F6351E586308"/>
to be highly their ſuperiors; ſuch as crowned heads, princes, and public perſons of diſtinguiſhed and eminent poſts. It is the manner of ſhowing that reſpect which is different. The man of faſhion and of the world, expreſſes it in its fulleſt extent; but naturally, eaſily, and without concern: whereas a man who is not uſed to keep good company, expreſſes it awkwardly; one ſees that he is not uſed to it, and that it coſts him a great deal; but I never ſaw the worſt-bred man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, guilty of lolling, whiſtling, ſcratching his head, and ſuch like indecencies, in company that he reſpected. In ſuch companies, therefore, the only point to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to is, to ſhow that reſpect, which every body means to ſhow, in an eaſy, unembarraſſed, and grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful manner. This is what obſervation and experience muſt teach you.</p>
                  <p>In mixed companies, whoever is admitted to make part of them, is, for the time at leaſt, ſuppoſed to be upon a footing of equality with the reſt; and, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, as there is no one principal object of awe and reſpect, people are apt to take a greater latitude in their behavior, and to be leſs upon their guard; and ſo they may, provided it be within certain bounds, which are upon no occaſion to be tranſgreſſed. But upon theſe occaſions, though no one is entitled to diſtinguiſhed marks of reſpect, every one claims, and very juſtly, every mark of civility and good breeding. Eaſe is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, careleſsneſs and negligence are ſtrictly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden. If a man accoſts you, and talk to you ever ſo dully or frivolouſly, it is worſe than rudeneſs, it is brutality, to ſhow him, by a manifeſt inattention to what he ſays, that you think him a fool or a block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and not worth hearing. It is much more ſo with regard to women; who, of whatever rank they are, are intitled, in conſideration of their ſex, not only to an attentive, but an officious, good breeding from men. Their little wants, likings, diſlikes, preferences, anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathies, and fancies, muſt be officiouſly attended to, and, if poſſible, gueſſed at and anticipated, by a well-bred man. You muſt never uſurp to yourſelf thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies and gratifications which are of common right; ſuch as the beſt places, the beſt diſhes, &amp;c. but, on the
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:021451_0035_0FB3F6369EA1CC00"/>
contrary, always decline them yourſelf, and offer them to others; who, in their turns, will offer them to you; ſo that, upon the whole, you will, in your turn, enjoy your ſhare of the common right. It would be endleſs for me to enumerate all the particular inſtances in which a well-bred man ſhows his good breeding in good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; and it would be injurious to you to ſuppoſe, that your own good ſenſe will not point them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ut to you, and then your own good nature will recommend, and your ſelf-intereſt enforce, the practice.</p>
                  <p>There is a third ſort of good breeding, in which people are the moſt apt to fail, from a very miſtaken notion that they cannot fail at all. I mean with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to one's moſt familiar friends and acquaintances, or thoſe who really are our inferiors; a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d there, undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, a greater degree of eaſe is not only allowable but proper, and contributes much to the comforts of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſocial life. But eaſe and freedom have their bounds, which muſt by no means be violated. A cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain degree of neglience and careleſsneſs becomes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious and inſulting, from the real or ſuppoſed inferio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the perſons; and that delightful liberty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation among a few friends, is ſoon deſtroyed, as li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty often has been, by being carried to licentiouſneſs. But example explains things beſt; and I will put a pretty ſtrong caſe. Suppoſe you and me alone toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; I believe you will allow that I have as good a right to unlimited freedom in your company, as either you or I can poſſibly have in any other; and I am apt to believe, too, that you would indulge me in that free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom as far as any body would. But, notwithſtanding this, do you imagine that I ſhould think there were no bounds to that freedom? I aſſure you I ſhould not think ſo; and I take myſelf to be as much tied down by a certain degree of good manners to you, as by other degrees of them to other people. The moſt familiar and intimate habitudes, connections, and friendſhips, require a degree of good breeding both to preſerve and cement them. The beſt of us have our bad ſides; and it is as imprudent as it is ill-bred, to exhibit them. I ſhall not uſe ceremony with you; it would be miſplaced between us; but I ſhall certainly obſerve that degree of
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:021451_0036_0FB3F6382C69EF20"/>
good breeding with you which is, in the firſt place, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and which, I am ſure, is abſolutely neceſſary to make us like one another's company long.</p>

                  <head>XXII. ADDRESS TO A YOUNG STUDENT.</head>
                  <p>YOUR parents have watched over your helpleſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, and conducted you, with many a pang, to an age at which your mind is capable of manly improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Their ſolicitude ſtill continues, and no trouble nor expence is ſpared in giving you all the inſtructions and accompliſhments which may enable you to act your part in life, as a man of poliſhed ſenſe and confirmed virtue. You have, then, already contracted a great debt of gratitude to them. You can pay it by no other method but by uſing the advantages which their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs has afforded you.</p>
                  <p>If your own endeavors are deficient, it is in vain that you have tutors, books, and all the external apparatus of literary purſuits. You muſt love learning, if you would poſſeſs it. In order to love it, you muſt feel its delights; in order to feel its delights, you muſt apply to it, however irkſome at firſt, cloſely, conſtantly, and for a conſiderable time. If you have reſolution enough to do this, you cannot but love learning; for the mind al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways loves that to which it has been long, ſteadily, and voluntarily attached. Habits are formed, which render what was at firſt diſagreeable, not only pleaſant, but neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>Pleaſant, indeed, are all the paths which lead to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite and elegant literature. Yours, then, is ſurely a lot particularly happy. Your education is of ſuch a ſort, that its principal ſcope is to prepare you to receive a refined pleaſure during your life. Elegance, or delicacy of taſte, is one of the firſt objects of a claſſical diſcipline; and it is this fine quality which opens a new world to the ſcholar's view. Elegance of taſte has a connection with many virtues, and all of them virtues of the moſt amiable kind. It tends to render you at once good and agreeable. You muſt therefore be an enemy to your own enjoyments, if you enter on the diſcipline which leads to the attainment of a claſſical and liberal educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with reluctance. Value duly the opportunities you
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:021451_0037_0FB3F6399D92D8B8"/>
enjoy, and which are denied to thouſands of your fellow creatures.</p>
                  <p>Without exemplary diligence you will make but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible proficiency. You may, indeed, paſs through the forms of ſchools and univerſities, but you will bring nothing away from them of real value. The proper ſort and degree of diligence you cannot poſſeſs, but by the effects of your own reſolution. Your inſtructor may indeed, confine you within the walls of a ſchool a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain number of hours. He may place books before you, and compel you to fix your eyes upon them; but no authority can chain down your mind. Your thoughts will eſcape from every external reſtraint, and, amidſt the moſt ſerious lectures, may be ranging in the wild pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of trifles or vice. Rules, reſtraints, commands, and puniſhments, may, indeed, aſſiſt in ſtrengthening your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ſolution; but, without your own voluntary choice y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>r diligence will not often conduce to your pleaſure or advantage. Though this truth is obvious, yet it ſeems to be a ſecret to thoſe parents who expect to find their ſon's improvement increaſe in proportion to the number of tutors and external aſſiſtances which their opulence has enabled them to provide. Theſe aſſiſtances, indeed, are ſometimes afforded, chiefly that the young heir to a title or eſtate may indulge himſelf in idleneſs and nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal pleaſures. The leſſon is conſtrued to him, and the exerciſe written for him by the private tutor, while the hapleſs youth is engaged in ſome ruinous pleaſure, which, at the ſame time, prevents him from learning any thing deſireable, and leads to the formation of deſtructive ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, which can ſeldom be removed.</p>
                  <p>But the principal obſtacle to your improvement at ſchool, eſpecially if you are too plentifully ſupplied with money, is a perverſe ambition of being diſtinguiſhed as a body of ſpirit in miſchievous pranks, in neglecting the taſks and leſſons, and for every vice and irregularity which the puerile age can admit. You will have ſenſe enough, I hope, to diſcover, beneath the maſk of gaiety and good-nature, that malignant ſpirit of detraction, which endeavors to render the boy who applies to books, and to all the duties and proper buſineſs of the ſchool, ridiculous. You will ſee, by the light of your
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:021451_0038_0FB3F63B1E405E98"/>
reaſon, that the ridicule is miſapplied. You will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, that the boys who have recourſe to ridicule, are, for the moſt part, ſtupid, unfeeling, ignorant, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious. Their noiſy folly, their bold confidence, their contempt of learning, and their defiance of authority, are, for the moſt part, the genuine effects of hardened inſenſibility. Let not their inſults and ill-treatment diſpirit you. If you yield to them with a tame and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſubmiſſion, they will not fail to triumph over you with additional inſolence. Diſplay a fortitude in your purſuits, equal in degree to the obſtinacy in which they perſiſt in theirs. Your fortitude will ſoon overcome theirs, which is, indeed, ſeldom any thing more than the audacity of a bully. Indeed, you cannot go through a ſchool with eaſe to yourſelf, and with ſucceſs, without a conſiderable ſhare of courage. I do not mean that ſort of courage which leads to battles and contentions, but which enables you to have a will of your own, and to purſue what is right, amidſt all the perſecutions of ſurrounding enviers, dunces, and detractors. Ridicule is the weapon made uſe of at ſchool, as well as in the world, when the fortreſſes of virtue are to be aſſailed. You will effectually repel the attack by a dauntleſs ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and unyielding perſeverance. Though numbers are againſt you, yet, with truth and rectitude on your ſide, you may, though alone, be equal to an army.</p>
                  <p>By laying in a ſtore of uſeful knowledge, adorning your mind with elegant literature, improving and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing your conduct by virtuous principles, you cannot fail of being a comfort to thoſe friends who have ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported you, of being happy within yourſelf, and of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well received by mankind. Honor and ſucceſs in life will probably attend you. Under all circumſtances you will have an internal ſource of conſolation and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, of which no ſublunary viciſſitude can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive you. Time will ſhow how much wiſer has been your choice than that of your idle companions, who would gladly have drawn you into their aſſociation, or rather into their conſpiracy, as it has been called, againſt good manners, and againſt all that is honorable and uſeful. While you appear in ſociety as a reſpectable and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable member of it, they will, perhaps, have ſacrificed,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:021451_0039_0FB3F63CA908EDB8"/>
at the ſhrine of vanity, pride, extravagance, and falſe pleaſure, their health and their ſenſe, their fortunes and their characters.</p>

I ſcarce remember, in my own obſervation, to have met with many old men, or with ſuch who (to uſe our Engliſh phraſe) 'wear well,' that had not at leaſt a certain indolence in their humor, if not a more than ordinary gaiety and cheerfulneſs of heart. The truth of it is, health and cheerfulneſs mutually beget each other; with this difference, that we ſeldom meet with a great degree of health which is not attended with a certain cheerfulneſs, but very often ſee cheerfulneſs where there is no great degree of health.</p>
                  <p>Cheerfulneſs bears the ſame friendly regard to the mind as to the body: it baniſhes all anxious care and diſcontent, ſoothes and compoſes the paſſions, and keeps the ſoul in a perpetual calm.</p>

For this reaſon, ſeveral painters have a green cloth hanging near them, to eaſe the eye upon, after too great an application to their coloring. A famous modern philoſopher accounts for it in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing manner: All colors that are more luminous, overpower and diſſipate the animal ſpirits which are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in ſight; on the contrary, thoſe that are more obſcure do not give the animal ſpirits a ſufficient exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe: whereas the rays that produce in us the idea of green, fall upon the eye in ſuch a due proportion, that they give the animal ſpirits their proper play, and by keeping up the ſtruggle in a juſt balance, excite a very pleaſing and agreeable ſenſation. Let the cauſe be what it will, the effect is certain; for which reaſon the poets aſcribe to this particular color the epithet of Cheerful.</p>
                  <p>To conſider further this double end in the works of nature, and how they are at the ſame time both uſeful and entertaining, we find that the moſt important parts in the vegetable world are thoſe which are the moſt beautiful. Theſe are the ſeeds by which the ſeveral races of plants are propagated and continued, and which are always lodged in flowers or bloſſoms. Nature ſeems to hide her principal deſign, and to be induſtrious in making the earth gay and delightful, while ſhe is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on her great work, and intent upon her own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. The huſbandman, after the ſame manner, is employed in laying out the whole country into a kind of garden or landſcape, and making everything ſmile about him, whilſt, in reality, he thinks of nothing but of the harveſt, and increaſe which is to ariſe from it.</p>
                  <p>We may further obſerve how Providence has taken care to keep up this cheerfulneſs in the mind of man, by having formed it after ſuch a manner, as to make it ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of conceiving delight from ſeveral objects which ſeem to have very little uſe in them; as from the wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of rocks and deſerts, and the like groteſque parts of nature. Thoſe who are verſed in philoſophy may ſtill
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:021451_0041_0FB3F63F9DAF9430"/>
carry this conſideration higher, by obſerving, that, if matter had appeared to us endowed only with thoſe real qualities which it actually poſſeſſes, it would have made but a very joyleſs and uncomfortable figure; and why has Providence given it a power of producing in us ſuch imaginary qualities, as taſtes and colors, ſounds and ſmells, heat and cold, but that man, while he is conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant in the lower ſtations of nature, might have his mind cheered and delighted with agreeable ſenſations? In ſhort, the whole univerſe is a kind of theatre filled with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that either raiſe in us pleaſure, amuſement, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration.</p>
                  <p>The reader's own thoughts will ſuggeſt to him the viciſſitude of day and night, the change of ſeaſons, with all that variety of ſcenes which diverſify the face of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and fill the mind with a perpetual ſucceſſion of beautiful and pleaſing images.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not here mention the ſeveral entertainments of art, with the pleaſures of friendſhip, books, converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and other accidental diverſions of life, becauſe I would only take notice of ſuch enticements to a cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful temper, as offer themſelves to perſons of all ranks and conditions, and which may ſufficiently ſhow us, that Providence did not deſign the world ſhould be filled with murmurs and repinings, or that the heart of man ſhould be involved in gloom and melancholy.</p>
                  <p>I the more inculcate this cheerfulneſs of temper, as it is a virtue in which our countrymen are obſerved to be more deficient than any other nation. Melancholy is a kind of demon that haunts our iſland, and often conveys herſelf to us in an eaſterly wind. A celebrated French noveliſt, in oppoſition to thoſe who begin their romances with the flowery ſeaſons of the year, enters on his ſtory thus:
<q>In the gloomy month of November, when the people of England hang and drown themſelves, a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate lover walked out into the fields, &amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Every one ought to fence againſt the temper of his climate or conſtitution, and frequently to indulge in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thoſe conſiderations which may give him a ſerenity of mind, and enable him to bear up cheerfully againſt thoſe little evils and misfortunes which are common to human nature, and which, by a right improvement of
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:021451_0042_0FB3F6411E32C620"/>
them, will produce a ſatiety of joy, and uninterrupted happineſs.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame time that I would engage my reader to conſider the world in its moſt agreeable lights, I muſt own there are many evils which naturally ſpring up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt the entertainments that are provided for us; but theſe if rightly conſidered, ſhould be far from overcaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the mind with ſorrow, or deſtroying that cheerfulneſs of temper which I have been recommending. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſperſion of evil with good, and pain with pleaſure, in the works of nature, is very truly aſcribed by Mr. Locke, in his eſſay on human underſtanding, to a moral reaſon, in the following words:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Beyond all this, we may find another reaſon why God hath ſcattered up and down ſeveral degrees of pleaſure and pain, in all the things that environ and affect us, and blended them together in almoſt all that our thoughts and ſenſes have to do with; that we, finding imperfection, diſſatisfaction, and want of complete happineſs in all the enjoyments which the creatures can afford us, might be led to ſeek it in the enjoyment of Him, 'with whom there is fulneſs of joy, and at whoſe right-hand are pleaſures for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</q>

                  <head>I. THE BAD READER.</head>
                  <p>JULIUS had acquired great credit at Cambridge by his compoſitions. They were elegant, animated, and judicious; and ſeveral prizes, at different times, had been adjudged to him. An oration, which he delivered the week before he left the univerſity, had been honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with particular applauſe; and, on his return home, he was impatient to gratify his vanity, and to extend his reputation, by having it read to a number of his father's literary friends.</p>
                  <p>A party was therefore collected; and, after dinner, the manuſcript was produced. Julius declined the office of reader, becauſe he had contracted a hoarſeneſs on his journey; and a conceited young man, with great for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs, offered his ſervices. Whilſt he was ſettling himſelf on his ſeat, licking his lips, adjuſting his mouth, hawking, hemming, and making other ridiculous prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations for the performance which he had undertaken, a profound ſilence reigned through the company, the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted effect of attention and expectation. The reader at length began; but his tone of voice was ſo ſhrill and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant, his utterance ſo vehement, his pronunciation ſo affected, his emphaſis ſo injudicious, and his accents were ſo improperly placed, that good manners alone reſtrained the laughter of the audience. Julius was all this while upon the rack, and his arm was more than once extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſnatch his compoſition from the coxcomb who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered it. But he proceeded, with full confidence in his own elocution; uniformly overſtepping, as Shakeſpeare expreſſes it, the modeſty of nature.</p>
                  <p>When the oration was concluded, the gentlemen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned their thanks to the author; but the compliments which they paid him were more expreſſive of politeneſs and civility, than of a conviction of his merit. Indeed, The beauties of his compoſition had been converted, by bad reading, into blemiſhes; and the ſenſe of it rendered
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:021451_0044_0FB3F6441CBFC1A8"/>
obſcure, and even unintelligible. Julius and his father could not conceal their vexation and diſappointment; and the gueſts, perceiving that they laid them under a painful reſtraint, withdrew, as ſoon as decency permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to their reſpective habitations.</p>

                  <p>IT happened at Athens, during a public repreſentation of ſome play exhibited in honor of the commonwealth, that an old gentleman came too late for a place ſuitable to his age and quality. Many of the young gentlemen, who obſerved the difficulty and confuſion he was in, made ſigns to him that they would accommodate him if he came where they ſat. The good man buſtled through the crowd accordingly: but when he came to the ſeats to which he was invited, the jeſt was, to ſit cloſe, and expoſe him as he ſtood out of countenance, to the whole audience. The frolic went round all the Athenian benches. But on thoſe occaſions there where alſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular places aſſigned for foreigners. When the good man ſkulked towards the boxes appointed for the Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians, that honeſt people, more virtuous than po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite, roſe up all to a man, and with greateſt reſpect received him among them. The Athenians being ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly touched with a ſenſe of the Spartan virtue and their own degeneracy, gave a thunder of applauſe; and the old man cried out, "The Athenians underſtand what is good, but the Lacedemonians practiſe it."</p>

                  <head>III. PIETY TO GOD RECOMMENDED TO THE YOUNG.</head>
                  <p>WHAT I ſhall firſt recommend, is piety to God. With this I begin, both as the foundation of good morals, and as a diſpoſition particularly graceful and becoming in youth. To be void of it, argues a cold heart, deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of ſome of the beſt affections which belong to that age. Youth is the ſeaſon of warm and generous emotions. The heart ſhould then ſpontaneouſly riſe into the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of what is great; glow with the love of what is fair and excellent; and melt at the diſcovery of tenderneſs and goodneſs. Where can any object be found ſo proper to kindle thoſe affections as the Father of the univerſe, and the Author of all felicity? Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:021451_0045_0FB3F64613A24690"/>
by veneration, can you contemplate that gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur and majeſty which His works every where diſplay? Untouched by gratitude, can you view that profuſion of good which, in this pleaſing ſeaſon of life, His bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent hand pours around you? Happy in the love and affection of thoſe with whom you are connected, look up to the Supreme Being, as the inſpirer of all the friendſhip which has ever been ſhown you by others; himſelf your beſt and your firſt friend: formerly, the ſupporter of your infancy, and the guide of your child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; now, the guardian of your youth, and the hope of your coming years. View religious homage as a natural expreſſion of gratitude to him for all his goodneſs. Conſider it as the ſervice of the God of your fathers; of him to whom your parents devoted you; of him whom, in former ages, your anceſtors honored; and by whom they are now rewarded and bleſſed in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Connected with ſo many tender ſenſibilities of ſoul, let religion be with you, not the cold and barren offspring of ſpeculation, but the warm and vigorous dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate of the heart.</p>

                  <head>IV. MODESTY AND DOCILITY.</head>
                  <p>To piety, join modeſty and docility, reverence of your parents, and ſubmiſſion to thoſe who are your ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors in knowledge, in ſtation, and in years. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence and obedience belong to youth. Modeſty is one of its chief ornaments; and has ever been eſteemed a preſage of riſing merit. When entering on the career of life, it is your part not to aſſume the reins as yet into your hands; but to commit yourſelves to the guidance of the more experienced, and to become wiſe by the wiſdom of thoſe who have gone before you. Of all the follies incident to youth, there are none which either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form its preſent appearance, or blaſt the proſpect of its future proſperity, more than ſelf-conceit, preſumption, and obſtinacy. By checking its natural progreſs in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, they fix it in long immaturity; and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently produce miſchiefs which can never be repaired. Yet theſe are vices too commonly found among the young. Big with enterpriſe, and elated by hope, they reſolve to truſt for ſucceſs to none but themſelves. Full
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:021451_0046_0FB3F6471ED595D0"/>
of their own abilities, they deride the admonitions which are given them by their friends, as the timorous ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions of age. Too wiſe to learn, too impatient to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate, too forward to be reſtrained, they plunge, with precipitant indiſcretion, into the midſt of all the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers with which life abounds.</p>

                  <head>V. SINCERITY.</head>
                  <p>IT is neceſſary to recommend to you ſincerity and truth. Theſe are the baſis of every virtue. That dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of character, where we can ſee no heart; thoſe foldings of art, through which no native affection is allowed to penetrate, preſent an object unamiable in every ſeaſon of life, but particularly odious in youth. If, at an age when the heart is warm, when the emotions are ſtrong, and when nature is expected to ſhow herſelf free and open, you can already ſmile and deceive, what are we to look for when you ſhall be longer hackneyed in the ways of men; when intereſt ſhall have completed the obduration of your heart, and experience ſhall have improved you in all the arts of guile? Diſſimulation in youth is the forerunner of perfidy in old age. Its firſt appearance is the fatal omen of growing depravity and future ſhame. It degrades parts and learning, obſcures the luſtre of every accompliſhment, and ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In all your proceedings be direct and conſiſtent. Ingenuity and candor poſſeſs the moſt powerful charm; they beſpeak univerſal favor, and carry an apology for almoſt every failing. The path of truth is a plain and ſafe path; that of falſehood is a perplexing maze. After the firſt departure from ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, it is not in your power to ſtop. One artifice una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably leads on to another; till, as the intricacy of the labyrinth increaſes, you are left entangled in your own ſnare. Deceit diſcovers a little mind, which ſtops at temporary expedients, without riſing to comprehenſive views of conduct. It betrays, at the ſame time, a da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtardly ſpirit. It is the reſource of one who wants cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to avow his deſigns, or to reſt upon himſelf.

which ought to diſtinguiſh youth. To ſet out in the world with no other principle than a crafty attention to intereſt, betokens one who is deſtined for creeping through the inferior walks of life: but to give an early preference to honor above gain, when they ſtand in competition; to deſpiſe every advantage which cannot be attained without diſhoneſt arts; to brook no mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to ſtoop to no diſſimulation; are the indications of a great mind, the preſages of future eminence and diſtinction in life. At the ſame time, this virtuous ſincerity is perfectly conſiſtent with the moſt prudent vigilance and caution. It is oppoſed to cunning, not to true wiſdom. It is not the ſimplicity of a weak and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provident, but the candor of an enlarged a noble mind; of one who ſcorns deceit, becauſe he accounts it both baſe and unprofitable; and who ſeeks no diſguiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he needs none to hide him.</p>

                  <p>YOUTH is the proper ſeaſon for cultivating the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent and humane affections. As a great part of your happineſs is to depend on the connections which you form with others, it is of high importance that you acquire betimes the temper and the manners which will render ſuch connections comfortable. Let a ſenſe of juſtice be the foundation of all your ſocial qualities. In your moſt early intercourſe with the world, and even in your youthful amuſements, let no unfairneſs be found. Engrave on your mind that ſacred rule, of "doing in all things to others according as you wiſh that they ſhould do unto you." For this end, impreſs yourſelves with a deep ſenſe of the original and natural equality of men. Whatever advantages of birth or fortune you poſſeſs, never diſplay them with an oſtentatious ſuperiority. Leave the ſubordinations of rank, to regulate the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of more advanced years. At preſent it becomes you to act among your companions as man with man. Remember how unknown to you are the viciſſitudes of the world; and how often they, on whom ignorant and contemptuous young men once looked down with ſcorn, have riſen to be their ſuperiors in future years. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion is an emotion of which you ought never to be

aſhamed. Graceful in youth is the tear of ſympathy, and the heart that melts at the tale of woe. Let not eaſe and indulgence contract your affections, and wrap you up in ſelfiſh enjoyment. Accuſtom yourſelves to think of the diſtreſſes of human life; of the ſolitary cottage, the dying parent, and the weeping orphan. Never ſport with pain and diſtreſs in any of your amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nor treat even the meaneſt inſect with wanton cruelty.</p>

                  <p>DILIGENCE, induſtry, and proper improvement of time, are material duties of the young. To no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe are they endowed with the beſt abilities, if they want activity for exerting them. Unavailing, in this caſe, will be every direction that can be given them, either for their temporal or ſpiritual welfare. In youth, the habits of induſtry are moſt eaſily acquired: in youth, the incentives to it are ſtrongeſt, from ambition and from duty, from emulation and hope, from all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects which the beginning of life affords. If, dead to theſe calls, you already languiſh in ſlothful inaction, what will be able to quicken the more ſluggiſh current of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing years? Induſtry is not only the inſtrument of improvement, but the foundation of pleaſure. Nothing is ſo oppoſite to the true enjoyment of life as the relaxed and feeble ſtate of an indolent mind.

Though it appear a ſlowly-flowing ſtream, yet it undermines all that is ſtable and flouriſhing. It not only ſaps the foundation of every virtue, but pours upon you a deluge of crimes and evils. It is like water, which firſt putrifies by ſtagnation, and then ſends up no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Generous ambition, and ſenſibility to praiſe, are, eſpecially at your age, among the marks of virtue. Think not that any affluence of fortune, or any eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of rank, exempts you from the duties of applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and induſtry.

If it cannot remove the diſquietudes ariſing out of a man's mind, body, or fortune, it makes him eaſy under them. It has indeed a kindly influence on the ſoul of man, in reſpect of every being to whom he ſtands related. It extinguiſhes all murmur, repining, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:021451_0051_0FB3F64E9D9D5068"/>
towards that Being who has allotted him his part to act in this world. It deſtroys all inordinate am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and every tendency to corruption, with regard to the community wherein he is placed. It gives ſweetneſs to his converſation, and a perpetual ſerenity to all his thoughts.</p>
                  <p>Among the many methods which may be made uſe of for the acquiring of this virtue. I ſhall only mention the two following. Firſt of all, a man ſhould always conſider how much he has more than he wants; and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, how much more unhappy he might be than he really is.</p>
                  <p>Firſt of all, a man ſhould always conſider how much he has more than he wants. I am wonderfully pleaſed with the reply which Ariſtippus made to one who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doled him upon the loſs of a farm: "Why," ſaid he, "I have three farms ſtill, and you have but one; ſo that I ought rather to be afflicted for you, than you for me." On the contrary, fooliſh men are more apt to conſider what they have loſt than what they poſſeſs; and to fix their eyes upon thoſe who are richer than themſelves, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than on thoſe who are under greater difficulties. All the real pleaſures and conveniencies of life lie in a narrow compaſs; but it is the humor of mankind to be always looking forward, and ſtraining after one who has got the ſtart of them in wealth and honor. For this reaſon, as there is none can be properly called rich, who have not more than they want; there are few rich men in any of the politer nations but among the middle ſort of people, who keep their wiſhes within their fortunes, and have more wealth than they know how to enjoy. Perſons of a higher rank live in a kind of ſplendid poverty; and are perpetually wanting, becauſe, inſtead of acquieſcing in the ſolid pleaſures of life, they endeavor to outvie one another in ſhadows and appearances. Men of ſenſe have at all times beheld with a great deal of mirth this ſilly game that is playing over their heads; and, by contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their deſires, enjoy all that ſecret ſatisfaction which others are always in queſt of. The truth is, this ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous chace after imaginary pleaſures cannot be ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expoſed, as it is the great ſource of thoſe evils which generally undo a nation. Let a man's eſtate be what it

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, he is a poor man if he does not live within it, and naturally ſets himſelf to ſale to any one that can give him his price. When Pittacus, after the death of his brother, who had left him a good eſtate, was offered a great ſum of money by the king of Lydia, he thanked him for his kindneſs, but told him he had already more by half than he knew what to do with. In ſhort, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent is equivalent to wealth, and luxury to poverty; or, to give the thought a more agreeable turn, "Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent is natural wealth," ſays Socrates; to which I ſhall add, Luxury is artificial poverty. I ſhall therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to the conſideration of thoſe who are always aiming after ſuperfluous and imaginary enjoyments, and will not be at the trouble of contracting their deſires, an excellent ſaying of Bion the philoſopher, namely, "That no man has ſo much care, as he who endeavors af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the moſt happineſs."</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond place, every one ought to reflect how much more unhappy he might be than he really is. The former conſideration took in all thoſe who are ſufficiently provided with the means to make themſelves eaſy; this regards ſuch as actually lie under ſome preſſure or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune. Theſe may receive great alleviation from ſuch a compariſon as the unhappy perſon may make between himſelf and others, or between the misfortune which he ſuffers, and greater mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>fortunes which might have befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len him.</p>
                  <p>I like the ſtory of the honeſt Dutchman, who, upon breaking his leg by a fall from the main-maſt, told the ſtanders by, it was a great mercy that it was not his neck. To which, ſince I have got into quotations, give me leave to add the ſaying of an old philoſopher, who, after having invited ſome of his friends to dine with him, was r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>led by his wife that came into the room in a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and threw down the table that ſtood before them: "Every one," ſays he, "has his calamity, and he is a happy man that has no greater than this." We find an inſtance to the ſame purpoſe in the life of Doctor Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, written by Biſhop Fell. As this good man was troubled with a complication of diſtempers, when he had the gout upon him, he uſed to thank God that it was
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:021451_0053_0FB3F65219507800"/>
not the ſtone; and when he had the ſtone, that he had not both theſe diſtempers on him at the ſame time.</p>
                  <p>I cannot conclude this eſſay without obſerving, that there was never any ſyſtem beſides that of Chriſtianity, which could effectually produce in the mind of man, the virtue I have been hitherto ſpeaking of. In order to make us contented with our condition, many of the profeſſed philoſophers tell us, that our diſcontent only hurts ourſelves, without being able to make any altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in our circumſtances; others, that whatever evil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fals us, is derived to us by a fatal neceſſity, to which the gods themſelves are ſubject; while others very gravely tell the man who is miſerable, that it is neceſſary he ſhould be ſo to keep up the harmony of the univerſe, and that the ſcheme of Providence would be troubled and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted were he otherwiſe. Theſe and the like conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions rather ſilence than ſatisfy a man. They may ſhow him that his diſcontent is unreaſonable, but are by no means ſufficient to relieve it. They rather give deſpair than conſolation. In a word, a man might reply to one of theſe comforters, as Auguſtus did to his friend who adviſed him not to grieve for the death of a perſon whom he loved, becauſe his grief could not fetch him again: "It is for that very reaſon," ſaid the emperor, "that I grieve."</p>
                  <p>On the contrary, religion bears a more tender regard to human nature. It preſcribes to every miſerable man the means of bettering his condition; nay, it ſhows him, that the bearing of his afflictions as he ought to do, will naturally end in the removal of them. It makes him eaſy here, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>WILL HONEYCOMB, who loves to ſhow upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion all the little learning he has picked up, told us yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday at the club, that he thought there might be a great deal ſaid for the tranſmigration of ſouls, and that the eaſtern parts of the world believed in that doctrine to this day. Sir Paul Rycaut, ſays he, gives us an account of ſeveral well-diſpoſed Mahometans that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe the freedom of any little bird they ſee confined to a cage; and think they merit as much by it, as we

ſhould do here by ranſoming any of our countrymen from their captivity at Algiers. You muſt know, ſays Will, the reaſon is, becauſe they conſider every animal as a brother or ſiſter in diſguiſe; and therefore think themſelves obliged to extend their charity to them, though under ſuch mean circumſtances. They will tell you, ſays Will, that the ſoul of a man, when he dies, immediately paſſes into the body of another man, or of ſome brute, which he reſembled in his humor, or his fortune, when he was one of us.</p>
                  <p>As I was wondering what this profuſion of learning would end in, Will told us that Jack Freelove, who was a fellow of whim, made love to one of thoſe ladies who throw away all their fondneſs on parrots, monkeys, and l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Jack, ſays he, was conducted into the parlor, where he diverted himſelf for ſome time with her favorite monkey, which was chained in one of the windows; till at length ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving a pen and ink lie by him, he writ the following letter to his miſtreſs, in the perſon of the monkey; and upon her not coming down ſo ſoon as he expected, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The lady, ſoon after coming into the parlor, and ſeeing her monkey look upon a paper with great ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs, took it up, and to this day is in ſome doubt, ſays Will, whether it was written by Jack or the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key.</p>

                        <p>"Madam,—Not having the gift of ſpeech, I have a long time waited in vain for an opportunity of making myſelf known to you; and having at preſent the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of pen, ink, and paper by me, I gladly take the occaſion of giving you my hiſtory in writing, which I could not do by word of mouth. You muſt know, Madam, that about a thouſand years ago I was an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Bramin, and verſed in all thoſe myſterious ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets which your European philoſopher, called Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras, is ſaid to have learned from our fraternity. I had ſo ingratiated myſelf by my great ſkill in the occult ſciences with a demon whom I uſed to converſe with, that he promiſed to grant me whatever I ſhould aſk of him. I deſired that my ſoul might never paſs into the
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:021451_0055_0FB3F6549FA810A0"/>
body of a brute creature; but this, he told me, was not in his power to grant me. I then begged, that into whatever creature I ſhould chance to tranſmigrate, I might ſtill retain my memory, and be conſcious that I was the ſame perſon who lived in different animals. This he told me was within his power; and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promiſed, on the word of a demon, that he would grant me what I deſired. From that time forth I lived ſo very unblameably, that I was made preſident of a college of Bramins; an office which I diſcharged with great integrity till the day of my death.</p>
                        <p>"I was then ſhuffled into another human body, and acted my part ſo very well in it, that I became firſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to a prince who reigned upon the banks of the Ganges. I here lived in great honor for ſeveral years, but by degrees loſt all the innocence of the Bramin, being obliged to rifle and oppreſs the people to enrich my ſovereign; till at length I became ſo odious, that my maſter, to recover his credit with his ſubjects, ſhot me through the heart with an arrow, as I was one day addreſſing myſelf to him at the head of his army.</p>
                        <p>"Upon my next remove, I found myſelf in the woods, under the ſhape of a jackall, and ſoon liſted myſelf in the ſervice of a lion; I uſed to yelp near his den about midnight, which was his time of rouſing and ſeeking after his prey. He always followed me in the rear; and when I had run down a fair buck, a wild goat, or a hare, after he had feaſted very plentifully upon it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, would now and then throw me a bone that was but half picked for my encouragement; but upon my being unſucceſsful in two or three chaces, he gave me ſuch a confounded gripe in his anger that I died of it.</p>
                        <p>"In my next tranſmigration I was again ſet upon two legs, and become an Indian tax-gatherer; but having been guilty of great extravagancies, and being married to an expenſive jade of a wife, I ran ſo curſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in debt, that I durſt not ſhow my head. I could no ſooner ſtep out of my houſe, but I was arreſted by ſome body or other that lay in wait for me. As I ventured abroad one night in the duſk of the evening, I was taken up and hurried into a dungeon, where I died a few months after.</p>

Several fiſhes of prey purſued me when I was in the water; and if I betook myſelf to my wings, it was ten to one but I had a flock of birds aiming at me. As I was one day flying amidſt a fleet of Engliſh ſhips, I obſerved a huge ſea-gull whetting his bill, and hovering juſt over my head: upon my dipping into the water to avoid him, I fell into the mouth of a monſtrous ſhark that ſwallowed me down in an inſtant.</p>

                  <p>CAESAR was endowed with every great and noble quality that could exalt human nature, and give a man the aſcendant in ſociety: formed to excel in peace as well as war, provident in council, fearleſs in action, and executing what he had reſolved with an amazing cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; generous beyond meaſure to his friends, placable to his enemies; and for parts, learning, eloquence, ſcarce inferior to any man. His orations were admired for two qualities, which are ſeldom found together, ſtrength and elegance. Cicero ranks him among the greateſt orators that Rome ever bred: and Quintilian ſays, that he ſpoke with the ſame force with which he fought; and if he had devoted himſelf to the bar, would have been the only man capable of rivaling Cicero. Nor was he a maſter only of the politer arts, but converſant alſo with the moſt abſtruſe and critical parts of learning; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other works which he publiſhed, addreſſed two books to Cicero on the analogy of language, or the art of ſpeaking and writing correctly. He was a moſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral patron of wit and learning, whereſoever they were

His capital paſſions were ambition and love of pleaſure; which he indulged in their turns to the greateſt exceſs: yet the firſt was always predominant; to which he could eaſily ſacrifice all the charms of the ſecond, and draw pleaſure even from toils and dangers, when they miniſtered to his glory.

His great abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities would neceſſarily have made him one of the firſt citizens of Rome; but diſdaining the condition of a ſubject, he could never reſt till he had made himſelf a monarch. In acting this laſt part, his uſual prudence ſeemed to fail him; as if the height to which he was mounted had turned his head, and made him giddy: for, by a vain oſtentation of his power, he deſtroyed the ſtability of it; and, as men ſhorten life by living too faſt, ſo, by an intemperance of reigning, he brought his reign to a violent end.</p>

                  <p>I WAS yeſterday comparing the induſtry of man with that of other creatures; in which I could not but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that, notwithſtanding we are obliged by duty to
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:021451_0060_0FB3F65C1F519400"/>
keep ourſelves in conſtant employ, after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as inferior animals are prompted to it by inſtinct, we fall very ſhort of them in this particular. We are here the more inexcuſable, becauſe there is a greater variety of buſineſs to which we may apply ourſelves. Reaſon opens to us a large field of affairs, which other creatures are not capable of. Beaſts of prey, and, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, of all other kinds in their natural ſtate of being, divide their time between action and reſt. They are always at work or ſleep. In ſhort, their waking hours are wholly taken up in ſeeking after their food, or in conſuming it. The human ſpecies only, to the great reproach of our natures, are filled with complaints, that "the day hangs heavy or them," that "they do not know what to do with themſelves," that "they are at a loſs how to paſs away their time;" with many of the like ſhameful murmurs, which we often find in the mouths of thoſe who are ſtyled reaſonable beings. How monſtrous are ſuch expreſſions among creatures who have the labors of the mind, as well as thoſe of the body, to furniſh them with proper employments; who, beſides the buſineſs of their proper callings and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, can apply themſelves to the duties of religion, to meditation, to the reading of uſeful books, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; in a word, who may exerciſe themſelves in the unbounded purſuits of knowledge and virtue, and every hour of their lives make themſelves wiſer or better than they were before!</p>
                  <p>After having been taken up for ſome time in this courſe of thought, I diverted myſelf with a book, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my uſual cuſtom, in order to unbend my mind before I went to ſleep. The book I made uſe of on this occaſion was Lucian, where I amuſed my thoughts for about an hour among the dialogues of the dead; which in all probability produced the following dream:</p>
                  <p>I was conveyed, methought, into the entrance of the infernal regions, where I ſaw Rhadamanthus, one of the judges of the dead, ſeated on his tribunal. On his left hand ſtood the keeper of Erebus, on his right the keeper of Elyſium. I was told he ſat upon women that day, there being ſeveral of the ſex lately arrived, who
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:021451_0061_0FB3F65D9CC00410"/>
had not yet their manſions aſſigned them. I was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed to hear him aſk every one of them the ſame queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, namely, What they had been doing? Upon this queſtion being propoſed to the whole aſſembly, they ſtared one upon another, as not knowing what to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. He then interrogated each of them ſeparately. Madam, ſays he to the firſt of them, you have been up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth about fifty years: what have you been do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there all this while? Doing, ſays ſhe; really I do not know what I have been doing; I deſire I may have time given me to recollect. After about half an hour's pauſe, ſhe told him that ſhe had been playing at crimp; upon which Rhadamanthus beckoned to the keeper on his left hand to take her into cuſtody. And you, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, ſays the judge, that look with ſuch a ſoft and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing air: I think you ſet out for this place in your nine-and-twentieth year, what have you been doing all this while? I had a great deal of buſineſs on my hands, ſays ſhe, being taken up the firſt twelve years of my life in dreſſing a jointed baby, and all the remaining part of it in reading plays and romances. Very well, ſays he, you have employed your time to good purpoſe. Away with her. The next was a plain country-woman: Well, miſtreſs, ſays Rhadamanthus, and what have you been doing? An't pleaſe your worſhip, ſays ſhe, I did not live quite forty years; and in that time brought my huſband ſeven daughters, made him nine thouſand cheeſes, and left my eldeſt girl with him to look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his houſe in my abſence; and who, I may venture to ſay, is as pretty a houſewife as any in the country. Rhadamanthus ſmiled at the ſimplicity of the good wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and ordered the keeper of Elyſium to take her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his care. And you, fair lady, ſays he, what have you been doing theſe five-and-thirty years? I have been doing no hurt, I aſſure you, Sir, ſaid ſhe. That is well, ſaid he; but what good have you been doing? The lady was in great confuſion at this queſtion; and not knowing what to anſwer, the two keepers leaped out to ſeize her at the ſame time; the one took her by the hand to convey her to Elyſium, the other caught hold of her to carry her away to Erebus. But Rhada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manthus obſerving an ingenuous modeſty in her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:021451_0062_0FB3F65F1EEF24C8"/>
and behavior, bid them both let her looſe, and ſet her aſide for re-examination when he was more at leiſure. An old woman, of a proud and ſure look, preſented herſelf next at the bar; and being aſked what ſhe had been doing? Truly, ſaid ſhe, I lived three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and ten years in a very wicked world, and was ſo angry at the behavior of a parcel young flirts, that I paſſed moſt of my laſt years in condemning the follies of the times. I was every day blaming the ſilly conduct of people about me, in order to deter thoſe I converſed with from falling into the like errors and miſcarriages. Very well, ſays Rhadamanthus, but did you keep the ſame watchful eye over your own actions? Why truly, ſays ſhe, I was ſo taken up with publiſhing the faults of others, that I had no time to conſider my own. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, ſays Rhadamathus, be pleaſed to file off to the left, and make room for the venerable matron that ſtands behind you. Old gentlewoman, ſays he, I think you are fourſcore; you have heard the queſtion; what have you been doing ſo long in the world? Ah, Sir, ſays ſhe, I have been doing what I ſhould not have done; but I had made a firm reſolution to have changed my life, if I had not been ſnatched off by an untimely end. Madam, ſays he, you will pleaſe to follow your leader: and, ſpying another of the ſame age, interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her in the ſame form. To which the matron re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, I have been the wife of a huſband who was as dear to me in his old age as in his youth. I have been a mother, and very happy in my children, whom I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored to bring up in every thing that is good. My eldeſt ſon is bleſt by the poor, and beloved by every one that knows him. I lived within my own family, and left it much more wealthy than I found it. Rhada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manthus, who knew the value of the old lady, ſmiled upon her in ſuch a manner, that the keeper of Elyſium, who knew his office, reached out his hand to her. He no ſooner touched her, but her wrinkles vaniſhed, her eyes ſparkled, her cheeks glowed with bluſhes, and ſhe appeared in full bloom and beauty. A young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, obſerving that this officer who conducted the happy to Elyſium, was ſo great a beautifier, longed to be in his hands; ſo that, preſſing through the crowd,
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:021451_0063_0FB3F6609D71E720"/>
ſhe was the next that appeared at the bar: and being aſked what ſhe had been doing the five and twenty years that ſhe had paſſed in the world? I have endeavored, ſays ſhe, ever ſince I came to years of diſcretion, to make myſelf lovely, and gain admirers. In order to it, I paſt my time in bottling up May-dew, inventing white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waſhes, mixing colors, cutting out patches, conſulting my glaſs, ſuiting my complexion—Rhadamanthus, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hearing her out, gave the ſign to take her off. Upon the approach of the keeper of Erebus, her color faded, herface was puckered up with wrinkles, and her whole perſon loſt in deformity.</p>
                  <p>I was then ſurpriſed with a diſtant ſound of a whole troop of females that came forward, laughing, ſinging, and dancing. I was very deſirous to know the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they would meet with, and withal was very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive that Rhadamanthus would ſpoil their mirth: but at their nearer approach, the noiſe grew ſo very great that it awakened me.</p>
                  <p>I lay ſome time reflecting in myſelf on the oddneſs of this dream; and could not forbear aſking my own heart, what I was doing? I anſwered myſelf that I was writing GUARDIANS. If my readers make as good a uſe of this work as I deſign they ſhould, I hope it will never be imputed to me as work that is vain and unprofitable.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall conclude this paper with recommending to them the ſame ſhort ſelf-examination. If every one of them frequently lays his hand upon his heart, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders what he is doing, it will check him in all the idle, or, what is worſe, the vicious, moments of life; lift up his mind when it is running on in a ſeries of indifferent actions, and encourage him when he is engaged in thoſe which are virtuous and laudable. In a word, it will very much alleviate that guilt which the beſt of men have reaſon to acknowledge in their daily confeſſions, of "leaving undone thoſe things which they ought to have done, and of doing thoſe things which they ought not to have done."</p>

                  <head>XV. CHARACTER OF FRANCIS I.</head>
                  <p>FRANCIS died at Rambouillet, on the laſt day of March, in the fifty-third year of his age, and the thirty-third of his reign.—During twenty-eight years of that time, an avowed rivalſhip ſubſiſted between him and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror: which involved, not only their own dominions, but the greater part of Europe, in wars, proſecuted with more violent animoſity, and drawn out to a greater length, than had been known in any former period. Many circumſtances contributed to both. Their ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity was founded in oppoſition of intereſt, heightened by perſonal emulation, and exaſperated, not only by mutual injuries, but by reciprocal inſults. At the ſame time, whatever advantage one ſeemed to poſſeſs towards gaining the aſcendant, was wonderfully ballanced by ſome favorable circumſtance peculiar to the other. The Emperor's dominions were of great extent; the French King's lay more compact: Francis governed his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom with abſolute power; that of Charles was limited, but he ſupplied the want of authority by addreſs: the troops of the former were more impetuous and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing; thoſe of the latter, better diſciplined, and more patient of fatigue.</p>
                  <p>The talents and abilities of the two monarchs were as different as the advantages which they poſſeſſed, and contributed no leſs to prolong the conteſt between them. Francis took his reſolutions ſuddenly; proſecuted them, at firſt, with warmth; and puſhed them into execution with a moſt adventurous courage: but, being deſtitute of the perſeverance neceſſary to ſurmount difficulties, he often abandoned his deſigns, or relaxed the vigor of purſuit, from impatience, and ſometimes from levity. Charles deliberated long, and determined with coolneſs: but, having once fixed his plan, he adhered to it with inflexible obſtinacy; and neither danger, nor diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, could turn him aſide from the execution of it.</p>
                  <p>The ſucceſs of their enterpriſes was as different as their characters, and was uniformly influenced by them. Francis, by his impetuous activity, often diſconcerted the Emperor's beſt-laid ſchemes; Charles, by a more calm, but ſteady proſecution of his deſigns, checked the
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:021451_0065_0FB3F6639FB1D4A0"/>
rapidity of his rival's career, and baffled or repulſed his moſt vigorous efforts. The former, at the opening of a war or of a campaign, broke in upon his enemy with the violence of a torrent, and carried all before him; the latter, waiting until he ſaw the force of his rival be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to abate, recovered, in the end, not only all that he had loſt, but made new acquiſitions. Few of the French monarch's attempts towards conqueſt, whatever promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing aſpect they might wear at firſt, were conducted to an happy iſſue; many of the Emperor's enterpriſes even after they appeared deſperate and impracticable, termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated in the moſt proſperous manner.</p>
                  <p>The degree, however, of their comparative merit and reputation, has not been fixed, either by a ſtrict ſcrutiny into their abilities for government, or by an impartial conſideration of the greatneſs and ſucceſs of their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings; and Francis is one of thoſe monarchs, who occupy a higher rank in the temple of fame, than ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their talents or performances intitle them to hold. This pre-eminence he owed to many different circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. The ſuperiority which Charles acquired by the victory of Pavia, and which, from that period, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved through the remainder of his reign, and was ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that Francis's ſtruggle againſt his exorbitant and growing dominion, was viewed by moſt of the other powers, not only with the partiality which naturally ariſes from thoſe who gallantly maintain an unequal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, but with the favor due to one, who was reſiſting a common enemy, and endeavoring to ſet bounds to a monarch equally formidable to them all. The charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of princes, too, eſpecially among the cotempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raries, depend, not only upon their talents for govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but upon their qualities as men. Francis, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the many errors conſpicuous in his foreign policy and domeſtic adminiſtration, was, nevertheleſs, humane, beneficent, generous. He poſſeſſed dignity without pride, affability free from meanneſs, and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſy exempt from deceit. All who had acceſs to know him, and no man of merit was ever denied that privilege, reſpected and loved him. Captivated with his perſonal qualities, his ſubjects forgot his defects as a monarch; and, admiring him as the moſt accompliſhed and amiable
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:021451_0066_0FB3F6651D103750"/>
gentleman in his dominions, they hardly murmured at acts of mal-adminiſtration, which, in a prince of leſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging diſpoſitions, would have been deemed unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                  <p>This admiration, however, muſt have been temporary only, and would have died away with the courtiers who beſtowed it; the illuſion ariſing from his private virtues muſt have ceaſed, and poſterity would have judged of his public conduct with its uſual impartiality; but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther circumſtance prevented this; and his name hath been tranſmitted to poſterity with increaſing reputation. Science, and the arts, had, at that time, made little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in France. They were juſt beginning to advance beyond the limits of Italy, where they had revived, and which had hitherto been their only ſeat. Francis took them immediately under his protection, and vied with Leo himſelf in the zeal and munificence with which he encouraged them. He invited learned men to his court, he converſed with them familiarly, he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed them in buſineſs, he raiſed them to offices of dignity, and honored them with his confidence. That race of men, not more prone to complain when denied the reſpect to which they fancy themſelves intitled, than apt to be pleaſed when treated with the diſtinction which they conſider as their due, thought they could not exceed in gratitude to ſuch a benefactor, and ſtrained their invention, and employed all their ingenuity, in panegyric.</p>
                  <p>Succeeding authors, warmed with their deſcriptions of Francis's bounty, adopted their encomiums, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined upon them. The appellation of FATHER OF LET<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERS, beſtowed upon Francis, hath rendered his memory ſacred among hiſtorians; and they ſeem to have regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it as a ſort of impiety, to uncover his infirmities, or to point out his defects. Thus Francis, notwithſtanding his inferior abilities, and want of ſucceſs, hath more than equalled the fame of Charles. The virtues which he poſſeſſed as a man, have intitled him to greater admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and praiſe, than have been beſtowed upon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive genius, and fortunate arts, of a more capable, but leſs amiable rival.</p>

                  <head>XVI. THE SUPPER AND GRACE.</head>
                  <p>A SHOE coming looſe from the fore-foot of the thill-horſe, at the beginning of the aſcent of mount Taurira, the poſtillion diſmounted, twiſted the ſhoe off, and put it in his pocket: as the aſcent was of five or ſix miles, and that horſe our main dependence, I made a point of having the ſhoe faſtened on again, as well as we could; but the poſtillion had thrown away the nails, and the hammer in the chaiſe-box being of no great uſe without them, I ſubmitted to go on.</p>
                  <p>He had not mounted half a mile higher, when, coming to a flinty piece of road, the poor devil loſt a ſecond ſhoe, and from off his other fore-foot. I then got out of the chaiſe in good earneſt; and, ſeeing a houſe about a quarter of a mile to the left-hand, with a great deal to do I prevailed upon the poſtilion to turn up to it. The look of the houſe, and every thing about it, as we drew nearer, ſoon reconciled me to the diſaſter. It was a little farm-houſe, ſurrounded with about twenty acres of vineyard, about as much corn; and cloſe to the houſe, on one ſide, was a potagerie of an acre and a half, full of every thing which could make plenty in a French peaſant's houſe: and, on the other ſide, was a little wood which furniſhed wherewithal to dreſs it. It was about eight in the evening when I got to the houſe: ſo I left the poſtillion to manage his point as he could; and, for mine, I walked directly into the houſe.</p>
                  <p>The family conſiſted of an old gray-headed man and his wife, with five or ſix ſons and ſons-in-law and their ſeveral wives, and a joyous genealogy out of them.</p>
                  <p>They were all ſitting down together to their lentil-ſoup; a large wheaten loaf was in the middle of the table; and a flagon of wine at each end of it promiſed joy through the ſtages of the repaſt—'twas a feaſt of love.</p>
                  <p>The old man roſe up to meet me, and, with a reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful cordiality, would have me ſit down at the table. My heart was ſet down the moment I entered the room: ſo I ſat down at once like a ſon of the family; and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt myſelf in the character as ſpeedily as I could, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly borrowed the old man's knife, and taking up the
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:021451_0068_0FB3F6681DE3B7D8"/>
loaf, cut myſelf a hearty luncheon; and, as I did it, I ſaw a teſtimony in every eye, not only of an honeſt welcome, but of a welcome mixed with thanks that I had not ſeemed to doubt it.</p>
                  <p>Was it this; or tell me, Nature, what elſe it was that made this morſel ſo ſweet—and to what magic I owe it, that the draught I took of their flagon was ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious with it, that it remains upon my palate to this hour?</p>
                  <p>If the ſupper was to my taſte, the grace which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed was much more ſo.</p>
                  <p>When ſupper was over, the old man gave a knock upon the table with the haft of his knife, to bid them prepare for the dance. The moment the ſignal was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the women and girls ran altogether into the back apartment to tie up their hair, and the young men to the door to waſh their faces, and change their ſabots, (WOODEN SHOES;) and in three minutes every ſoul was ready, upon a little eſplanade before the houſe, to begin. The old man and his wife came out laſt, and placing me betwixt them, ſat down upon a ſopha of turf by the door.</p>
                  <p>The old man had ſome fifty years ago been no mean performer upon the vielle; and at the age he was then of, touched it well enough for the purpoſe. His wife ſung now-and-then a little to the tune, then intermitted, and joined her old man again, as their children and grandchildren danced before them.</p>
                  <p>It was not till the middle of the ſecond dance, when, for ſome pauſes in the movement wherein they all ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to look up, I fancied I could diſtinguiſh an elevation of ſpirit different from that which is the cauſe or the effect of ſimple jollity. In a word, I thought I beheld religion mixing in the dance; but, as I had never ſeen her ſo engaged, I ſhould have looked upon it now as one of the illuſions of an imagination which is eternally miſleading me, had not the old man, as ſoon as the dance ended, ſaid, that this was their conſtant way; and that all his life long, he made it a rule, after ſupper was over, to call out his family to dance and rejoice; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, he ſaid, that a cheerful and contented mind was the beſt ſort of thanks to heaven that an illiterate pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant could pay.—Or a learned prelate either, ſaid I.</p>

                  <p>When we enter into the houſe of mourning ſuch as this —it is impoſſible to inſult the unfortunate even with an improper look—Under whatever levity and diſſipation of heart ſuch objects catch our eyes,—they catch like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe our attentions, collect and call home our ſcattered thoughts, and exerciſe them with wiſdom. A tranſient ſcene of diſtreſs, ſuch as is here ſketched, how ſoon does it furniſh materials to ſet the mind at work? how neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily does it engage it to the conſideration of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries and misfortunes, the dangers and calamities, to which the life of man is ſubject? By holding up ſuch a glaſs before it, it forces the mind to ſee and reflect upon the vanity—the periſhing condition and uncertain tenure, of every thing in this world. From reflections of this ſerious caſt, how inſenſibly do the thoughts carry us farther?—and from conſidering what we are,—what kind of world we live in, and what evil befals us in it, how naturally do they ſet us to look forward at what poſſibly we ſhall be?—for what kind of world we are intended—what evils may befal us there—and what proviſion we ſhould make againſt them here whilſt we have time and opportunity? If theſe leſſons are ſo inſeper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able from the houſe of mourning here ſuppoſed—we ſhall find it a ſtill more inſtructive ſchool of wiſdom when we take a view of the place in that more affecting light in which the wiſe man ſeems to confine it in the text; in which, by the houſe of mourning, I believe he means that particular ſcene of ſorrow, where there is lamentation and mourning for the dead. Turn in hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I beſeech you, for a moment. Behold a dead man ready to be carried out, the only ſon of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſhe a widow. Perhaps a ſtill more affecting ſpectacle, a kind and indulgent father of a numerous family lies breathleſs—ſnatched away in the ſtrength of his age—torn in an evil hour from his children and the boſom of a diſconſolate wife. Behold much people of the city gathered together to mix their tears, with ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled ſorrow in their looks, going heavily along to the houſe of mourning, to perform that laſt melancholy of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, which, when the debt of nature is paid, we are
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:021451_0071_0FB3F66C9DF18318"/>
called upon to pay to each other. If this ſad occaſion which leads him there, has not done it already, take notice, to what a ſerious and devout frame of mind e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man is reduced the moment he enters THIS gate of affliction. The buſy and fluttering ſpirits, which in the houſe of mirth were wont to tranſport him from one di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting object to another—ſee how they are fallen! how peaceably they are laid! In this gloomy manſion, full of ſhades and uncomfortable damps to ſeize the ſoul— ſee, the light and eaſy heart, which never knew what it was to think before, how penſive it is now, how ſoft, how ſuſceptible, how full of religious impreſſions, how deeply it is ſmitten with a ſenſe and with a love of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue! Could we, in this criſis, whilſt this empire of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and religion laſts, and the heart is thus exerciſed with wiſdom and buſied with heavenly contemplations— could we ſee it naked as it is—ſtripped of its paſſions, unſpotted by the world, and regardleſs of its pleaſures —we might then ſafely reſt our cauſe upon this ſingle evidence, and appeal to the moſt ſenſual, whether Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon has not made a juſt determination here, in favor of the houſe of mourning? not for its own ſake, but as it is fruitful in virtue, and becomes the occaſion of ſo much good. Without this end, ſorrow, I own, has no uſe but to ſhorten man's days—nor can gravity, with all its ſtudied ſolemnity of look and carriage, ſerve any end but to make one half of the world merry, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon the other.</p>

                  <p>PETRARCH, a celebrated Italian poet, who flouriſhed about four hundred years ago, recommended himſelf to the confidence and affection of Cardinal Colonna, in whoſe family he reſided, by his candor and ſtrict regard to truth. A violent quarrel occurred in the houſehold of this nobleman; which was carried ſo far, that recourſe was had to arms. The Cardinal wiſhed to know the foundation of this affair; and, that he might be able to decide with juſtice, he aſſembled all his people, and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them to bind themſelves, by a moſt ſolemn oath on the Goſpels, to declare the whole truth. Every one, without exception, ſubmitted to this determination; even the biſhop of Luna, brother to the Cardinal, was not excuſed. Petrarch, in his turn, preſenting himſelf to take the oath, the cardinal cloſed the book, and ſaid, AS TO YOU, PETRARCH, YOUR WORD IS SUFFICIENT.</p>

                  <p>THIS kind of impertinence is a habit of talking much without thinking.</p>
                  <p>A man who has this diſtemper in his tongue ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain you, though he never ſaw you before, with a long ſtory in praiſe of his own wife; give you the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of his laſt night's dream, or the deſcription of a feaſt he has been at, without letting a ſingle diſh eſcape him. When he is thus entered into converſation, he grows very wiſe; deſcants upon the corruption of the times and the degeneracy of the age we live in; from which, as his tranſitions are ſomewhat ſudden, he falls upon the price of corn, and the number of ſtrangers that are in town. He undertakes to prove, that it is better putting to ſea in ſummer than in winter, and that rain is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to produce a good crop of corn; telling you, in the ſame breath, that he intends to plough up ſuch a

He acquaints you, that Demippus had the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt torch at the feaſt of Ceres; aſks you, if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how many pillars are in the muſic-theatre; tells you that he took phyſic yeſterday; and deſires to know what day of the month it is. If you have patience to hear him, he will inform you what feſtivals are kept in Auguſt, what in October, and what in December.</p>

                  <p>As a deſcriber of life and manners, Mr Addiſon muſt be allowed to ſtand perhaps the firſt in the firſt rank. His humor is peculiar to himſelf; and is ſo happily dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, as to give the grace of novelty to domeſtic ſcenes and daily occurrences. He never O'ERSTEPS THE MO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DESTY OF NATURE, nor raiſes merriment or wonder by the violation of truth. His figures neither divert by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion, nor amaze by aggravation. He copies life with ſo much fidelity, that he can hardly be ſaid to invent; yet his exhibitions have an air ſo much original, that it is difficult to ſuppoſe them not merely the product of imagination.</p>
                  <p>As a teacher of wiſdom, he may be confidently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. His religion has nothing in it enthuſiaſtic or ſuperſtitious; he appears neither weakly credulous nor wantonly ſceptical; his morality is neither dangerouſly lax, nor implacably rigid. All the enchantments of fancy, and all the cogency of argument, are employed to recommend to the reader his real intereſt, the care of pleaſing the Author of his being. Truth is ſhown ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as the phantom of a viſion, ſometimes appears half-veiled in an allegory, ſometimes attracts regard in the robes of fancy, and ſometimes ſteps forth in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of reaſon.

His page is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways luminous, but never blazes in unexpected ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor. It ſeems to have been his principal endeavor to avoid all harſhneſs and ſeverity of diction; he is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſometimes verboſe in his tranſitions and connections, and ſometimes deſcends too much to the language of converſation; yet, if his language had been leſs idioma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, it might have loſt ſomewhat of its genuine Angli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm. What he attempted he performed: he is never feeble, and he did not wiſh to be energetic; he is never rapid, and he never ſtagnates. His ſentences have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtudied amplitude nor affected brevity; his periods, though not diligently rounded, are voluble and eaſy.— Who ever wiſhes to attain an Engliſh ſtyle, familiar but not coarſe, and elegant but not oſtentatious, muſt give his days and nights to the volumes of Addiſon.</p>

                  <head>IV. PLEASURE AND PAIN.</head>
                  <p>THERE were two families, which, from the beginning of the world, were as oppoſite to each other as light and darkneſs. The one of them lived in heaven, and the other in hell. The youngeſt deſcendant of the firſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily was Pleaſure; who was the daughter of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, who was the child of Virtue, who was the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of the Gods. Theſe, as I ſaid before, had their habitation in heaven. The youngeſt of the oppoſite fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily was Pain; who was the ſon of Miſery, who wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the child of Vice, who was the offspring of the Furies. The habitation of this race of beings was in hell.</p>
                  <p>The middle ſtation of nature between theſe two op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite extremes was the earth, which was inhabited by creatures of a middle kind; neither ſo virtuous as the one, nor ſo vicious as the other, but partaking of the good and bad qualities of theſe two oppoſite families. Jupiter, conſidering that this ſpecies, commonly called MAN, was too virtuous to be miſerable, and too vicious to be happy, that he might make a diſtinction between the good and the bad, ordered the two youngeſt of the
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:021451_0075_0FB3F6729E03CAC8"/>
above mentioned families (Pleaſure, who was the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Happineſs; and Pain, who was the ſon of Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) to meet one another upon this part of nature; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving promiſed to ſettle it upon them both, provided they could agree upon the diviſion of it, ſo as to ſhare man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind between them.</p>
                  <p>Pleaſure and Pain were no ſooner met in their new habitation, but they immediately agreed upon this point. That Pleaſure ſhould take poſſeſſion of the virtuous, and Pain of the vicious part of that ſpecies which was given up to them. But, upon examining to which of them any individual they met with belonged, they found each of them had a right to him; for that, contrary to what they had ſeen in their old places of reſidence, there was no perſon ſo vicious who had not ſome good in him, nor any perſon ſo virtuous who had not in him ſome evil. The truth of it is, they generally found, upon ſearch, that in the moſt vicious man, Pleaſure might lay claim to an hundredth part, and that in the moſt virtuous man Pain might come in for at leaſt two thirds.. This they ſaw would occaſion endleſs diſputes between them, unleſs they could come to ſome accommodation. To this end, there was a marriage propoſed between them, and at length concluded. Hence it is that we find Pleaſure and Pain are ſuch conſtant yoke-fellows, and that they either make their viſits together, or are never far aſunder. If Pain comes into a heart, he is quickly followed by Pleaſure; and if Pleaſure enters, you may be ſure Pain is not far off.</p>
                  <p>But notwithſtanding this marriage was very conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for the two parties, it did not ſeem to anſwer the intention of Jupiter in ſending them among mankind. To remedy, therefore, this inconvenience, it was ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulated between them by article, and confirmed by the conſent of each family, that, notwithſtanding they here poſſeſſed the place indifferently, upon the death of every perſon, if he were fond to have in him a certain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of evil, he ſhould be diſpatched into the infernal regions by a paſſport from Pain, there to dwell with Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, Vice, and the Furies; or, on the contrary, if he had in him a certain proportion of good, he ſhould be

diſpatched into heaven by a paſſport from Pleaſure, there to dwell with happineſs, Virtue, and the Gods.</p>

                  <head>V. SIR ROGER DE COVERLY'S FAMILY.</head>
                  <p>HAVING often received an invitation from my friend Sir Roger de Coverly to paſs away a month with him in the country, I laſt week accompanied him thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and am ſettled with him for ſome time at his country-houſe, where I intend to form ſeveral of my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing ſpeculations. Sir Roger, who is very well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with my humor, lets me riſe and go to bed when I pleaſe, dine at his own table or in the chamber as I think fit, ſit ſtill and ſay nothing without bidding me be merry. When the gentlemen of the country come to ſee him, he only ſhows me at a diſtance. As I have been walking in his fields, I have obſerved them ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſight of me over the hedge, and have heard the knight deſiring them not to let me ſee them, for that I hated to be ſtared at.</p>
                  <p>I am the more at eaſe in Sir Roger's family, becauſe it conſiſts of ſober and ſtaedy perſons; for as the knight is the beſt maſter in the world, he ſeldom changes his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; and as he is beloved by all about him, his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants never care for leaving him; by which means his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtics are all in years, and grown old with their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. You would take his valet-de-chambre for his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, his butler is gray-headed, his groom is one of the graveſt men I have ever ſeen, and his coachman has the looks of a privy-counſellor. You ſee the goodneſs of the maſter even in the old houſe-dog, and in a gray pad that is kept in the ſtable with great care and tenderneſs out of regard to his paſt ſervices, though he has been uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs for ſeveral years.</p>
                  <p>I could not but obſerve, with a great deal of pleaſure, the joy that appeared in the countenances of theſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient domeſtics upon my friend's arrival at his country-ſeat. Some of them could not refrain from tears at the ſight of their old maſter; every one of them preſſed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to do ſomething for him, and ſeemed diſcouraged if they were not employed. At the ſame time the good old knight, with a mixture of the father and the maſter of the family, tempered the inquiries after his own af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:021451_0077_0FB3F6759D1A7C38"/>
with ſeveral kind queſtions relating to themſelves. This humanity and good-nature engages every body to him; ſo that when he is pleaſant upon any of them, all his family are in good humor, and none ſo much as the perſon whom he diverts himſelf with: on the contrary, if he coughs, or betrays any infirmity of old age, it is eaſy for a ſtander-by, to obſerve a ſecret concern in the looks of all his ſervants.</p>
                  <p>My worthy friend has put me under the particular care of his butler, who is a very prudent man, and, as well as the reſt of his fellow-ſervants, wonderfully deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of pleaſing me, becauſe they have often heard their maſter talk of me as of his particular friend.</p>
                  <p>My chief companion, when Sir Roger is diverting himſelf in the woods or the fields, is a very venerable man, who is ever with Sir Roger, and has lived at his houſe, in the nature of a chaplain above thirty years. This gentleman is a perſon of good ſenſe and ſome learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of a very regular life and obliging converſation: he heartily loves Sir Roger, and knows that he is very much in the old knight's eſteem; ſo that he lives in the family rather as a relation than a dependant.</p>
                  <p>I have obſerved in ſeveral of my papers, that my friend Sir Roger, amidſt all his good qualities, is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a humoriſt; and that his virtues, as well as imperfections, are as it were tinged by a certain extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance, which makes them particularly HIS, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhes them from thoſe of other men. This caſt of mind, as it is generally very innocent in itſelf, ſo it renders his converſation highly agreeable, and more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful than the ſame degre of ſenſe and virtue would appear in their common and ordinary colors. As I was walking with him laſt night, he aſked me how I li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the good man whom I have juſt now mentioned? and, without ſtaying for my anſwer, told me, that he was afraid of being inſulted with Latin and Greek at his own table; for which reaſon he deſired a particular friend of his at the univerſity to find him out a clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man rather of plain ſenſe than much learning, of a good aſpect, a clear voice, a ſociable temper; and, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, a man that underſtood a little of back-gammon. My friend, ſays Sir Roger, found me out this gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:021451_0078_0FB3F6771D4FDC48"/>
who, beſides the endowments required of him, is, they tell me, a good ſcholar, though he does not ſhow it. I have given him the parſonage of the pariſh; and becauſe I know his value, have ſettled upon him a good annuity for life. If he outlives me, he ſhall find that he was higher in my eſteem than perhaps he thinks he is. He has now been with me thirty years; and though he does not know I have taken notice of it, has never in all that time aſked any thing of me for himſelf, though he is every day ſoliciting me for ſomething in behalf of one or other of my tenants his pariſhioners. There has not been a law-ſuit in the pariſh ſince he has lived among them. If any diſpute ariſes, they apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to him for the deciſion: if they do not acquieſce in his judgment, which I think never happened above once or twice at moſt, they appeal to me. At his firſt ſettling with me, I made him a preſent of all the good ſermons which have been printed in Engliſh; and only begged of him, that every Sunday he would pronounce one of them in the pulpit. Accordingly he has digeſted them into ſuch a ſeries, that they follow one another naturally, and make a continued ſyſtem of practical divinity.</p>
                  <p>As Sir Roger was going on in his ſtory, the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man we were talking of came up to us; and upon the Knight's aſking him who preached to-morrow (for it was Saturday night,) told us the Biſhop of St Aſaph in the morning, and Dr South in the afternoon. He then ſhowed us his liſt of preachers for the whole year; where I ſaw, with a great deal of pleaſure, Archbiſhop Tillotſon, Biſhop Saunderſon, Dr Barrow, Dr Calamy, with ſeveral living authors who have publiſhed diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of practical divinity. I no ſooner ſaw this venerable man in the pulpit, but I very much approved of my friend's inſiſting upon the qualifications of a good aſpect and a clear voice; for I was ſo charmed with the grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of his figure and delivery, as well as with the diſcourſes he pronounced, that I think I never paſſed any time more to my ſatisfaction. A ſermon repeated after this manner, is like the compoſition of a poet in the mouth of a graceful actor.</p>

                  <p>THIS world may be conſidered as a great mart of commerce, where fortune expoſes to our view va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious commodities, riches, eaſe, tranquillity, fame, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, knowledge. Every thing is marked at a ſettled price. Our time, our labor, our ingenuity, is ſo much ready money which we are to lay out to the beſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. Examine, compare, chooſe, reject: but ſtand to your own judgment; and do not, like children, when you have purchaſed one thing, repine that you do not poſſeſs another which you did not purchaſe. Such is the force of well-regulated induſtry, that a ſteady and vigorous exertion of our faculties, directed to one end, will ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally inſure ſucceſs. Would you, for inſtance, be rich? Do you think that ſingle point worth the ſacrificing every thing elſe to? You may then be rich. Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands have become ſo from the loweſt beginnings, by toil, and patient diligence, and attention to the minuteſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of expence and profit. But you muſt give up the pleaſures of leiſure, of a vacant mind, of a free unſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious temper. If you preſerve your integrity, it muſt be a coarſe-ſpun and vulgar honeſty. Thoſe high and lofty notions of morals which you brought with you from the ſchools muſt be conſiderably lowered, and mixed with the baſer alloy of a jealous and worldly-minded pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. You muſt learn to do hard, if not unjuſt things; and, for the nice embarraſſments of a delicate and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous ſpirit, it is neceſſary for you to get rid of them as faſt as poſſible. You muſt ſhut your heart againſt the muſes, and be content to feed your underſtanding with plain houſehold truth. In ſhort, you muſt not attempt to enlarge your ideas, or poliſh your taſte, or refine your ſentiments; but muſt keep on in one beaten track, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out turning aſide either to the right hand or to the left.— "But I cannot ſubmit to drudgery like this—I feel a ſpirit above it." 'Tis well: be above it then; only do not repine that you are not rich.</p>
                  <p>Is knowledge the pearl of price? That, too, may be purchaſed—by ſteady application, and long ſolitary hours of ſtudy and reflection. Beſtow theſe, and you ſhall be learned. "But," ſay the man of letters, "what a hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip

                  <head>VII. DESCRIPTION OF THE VALE OF KESWICK IN CUMBERLAND.</head>
                  <p>THIS delightful vale is thus elegantly deſcribed by the late ingenious Dr Brown, in a letter to a friend.</p>
                  <p>In my way to the north from Hagley, I paſſed through Dovedale; and, to ſay the truth, was diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in it. When I came to Buxton, I viſited ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or two of their romantic ſcenes; but theſe are infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to Dovedale. They are all but poor miniatures of Keſwick; which exceeds them more in grandeur than you can imagine; and more, if poſſible, in beauty than in grandeur.</p>
                  <p>Inſtead of the narrow ſlip of valley which is ſeen at Dovedale, you have at Keſwick a vaſt amphitheatre, in circumference above twenty miles. Inſtead of a meagre rivulet, a noble living-lake, ten miles round, of an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long form, adorned with a variety of wooded iſlands. The rocks indeed of Dovedale are finely wild, pointed, and irregular; but the hills are both little and unanima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and the margin of the brook is poorly edged with weeds, moraſs, and bruſhwood. But at Keſwick, you will, on one ſide of the lake, ſee a rich and beautiful landſcape of cultivated fields, riſing to the eye in fine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equalities, with noble groves of oak, happily diſperſed,
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:021451_0082_0FB3F67D23169310"/>
and climbing the adjacent hills, ſhade above ſhade, in the moſt various and pictureſque forms. On the oppoſite ſhore, you will find rocks and cliffs of ſtupendous height, hanging broken over the lake in horrible grandeur, ſome of them a thouſand feet high, the woods climbing up their ſteep and ſhaggy ſides, where mortal foot never yet approached. On theſe dreadful heights the eagles build their neſts; a variety of water-falls are ſeen pouring from their ſummits, and tumbling in vaſt ſheets from rock to rock in a rude and terrible magnificence: while on all ſides of this immenſe amphitheatre the lofty moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains riſe round; piercing the clouds in ſhapes as ſpiry and fantaſtic as the very rocks of Dovedale. To this I muſt add the frequent and bold projection of the cliffs into the lake, forming noble bays and promontories: in other parts they finely retire from it, and often open in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt chaſms or clefts, through which at hand you ſee rich and uncultivated vales; and beyond theſe, at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious diſtance, mountain riſing over mountain; among which, new proſpects preſents themſelves in miſt, till the eye is loſt in an agreeable perplexity;
<q>
                        <l>Where active fancy travels beyond ſenſe,</l>
                        <l>And pictures things unſeen.—</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Were I to analyſe the two places in their conſtituent principles, I ſhould tell you, that the full perfection of Keſwick conſiſts of three circumſtances; beauty, horror, and immenſity, united; the ſecond of which alone is found in Dovedale. Of beauty it hath little, nature having left it almoſt a deſert: neither its ſmall extent, nor the diminutive and lifeleſs form of the hills, admit magnificence; but to give you a complete idea of theſe three perfections, as they are joined in Keſwick, would require the united powers of Claude, Salvator, and Pouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin. The firſt ſhould throw his delicate ſunſhine over the cultivated vales, the ſcattered cots, the groves, the lake, and wooded iſlands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ſecond ſhould daſh out the horror of the rugged cliffs, the ſteeps, the hanging woods, and foaming water-falls; while the grand pencil of Pouſſin ſhould crown the whole with the majeſty of the impending mountains.</p>
                  <p>So much for what I would call the permanent beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this aſtoniſhing ſcene. Were I not afraid of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:021451_0083_0FB3F67E9D68C348"/>
tireſome, I could now dwell as long on its varying or accidental beauties. I would ſail round the lake, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor in every bay, and land you in every promontory and iſland. I would point out the perpetual change of proſpect; the woods, rocks, cliffs, and mountains, by turns vaniſhing or riſing into view: now gaining on the ſight, hanging over our heads in their full dimenſions, beautifully dreadful: and now, by a change of ſituation, aſſuming new romantic ſhapes; retiring and leſſening on the eye, and inſenſibly loſing themſelves in an azure miſt. I would remark the contraſt of light and ſhade, produced by the morning and evening ſun; the one gilding the weſtern, the other the eaſtern, ſide of this immenſe amphitheatre; while the vaſt ſhadow projected by the mountains buries the oppoſite part in a deep and purple gloom, which the eye can hardly penetrate. The natural variety of coloring which the ſeveral objects produce, is no leſs wonderful and pleaſing: the ruling tints in the valley being thoſe of azure, green, and gold; yet ever various, ariſing from an intermixture of the lake, the woods, the graſs, and corn-fields: theſe are finely contraſted by the gray rocks and cliffs; and the whole heightened by the yellow ſtreams of light, the purple hues and miſty azure of the mountains. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a ſerene air and clear ſky diſcloſe the tops of the higheſt hills; at other times, you ſee the clouds involving their ſummits, reſting on their ſides, or deſcending to their baſe, and rolling among the valleys, as in a vaſt furnace. When the winds are high, they roar among the cliffs and caverns like peals of thunder; then, too, the clouds are ſeen in vaſt bodies ſweeping along the hills in gloomy greatneſs, while the lake joins the tumult, and toſſes like a ſea. But, in calm weather, the whole ſcen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> becomes new: the lake is a perfect mirror, and the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape in all its beauty: iſlands, fields, woods, rocks, and mountains, are ſeen inverted, and floating on its ſurface. I will now carry you to the top of a cliff, where, if you dare approach the ridge, a new ſcene of aſtoniſhment preſents itſelf; where the valley, lake, and iſlands, ſeem lying at your feet; where this expanſe of water appears diminiſhed to a little pool, amidſt the vaſt and immeaſurable objects that ſurround it; for here the
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:021451_0084_0FB3F6801D602C10"/>
ſummits of more diſtant hills appear beyond thoſe you have already ſeen; and, riſing behind each other in ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive ranges and azure groups of craggy and broken ſteeps, form an immenſe and awful picture, which can only be expreſſed by the image of a tempeſtuous ſea of mountains. Let me now conduct you down again to the valley, and conclude with one circumſtance more; which is, that a walk by ſtill moon-light (at which time the diſtant water-falls are heard in all their variety of ſound) among theſe enchanting dales, opens ſuch ſcenes of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate beauty, repoſe, and ſolemnity, as exceed all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.</p>

                  <head>VIII. PITY, AN ALLEGORY.</head>
                  <p>IN the happy period of the golden age, when all the celeſtial inhabitants deſcended to the earth, and converſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed familiarly with mortals, among the moſt cheriſhed of the heavenly powers, were twins, the offspring of Jupiter, LOVE and JOY. Wherever they appeared, the flowers ſprung up beneath their feet, the ſun ſhone with a brighter radiance, and all nature ſeemed embelliſhed by their preſence.</p>
                  <p>They were inſeparable companions; and their grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing attachment was favored by Jupiter, who had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, that a laſting union ſhould be ſolemnized between them ſo ſoon as they were arrived at maturer years. But, in the mean time, the ſons of men deviated from their native innocence; vice and ruin over-ran the earth with giant ſtrides; and Aſtrea, with her train of cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial viſitants, forſook their polluted abodes. Love alone remained, having been ſtolen away by Hope, who was his nurſe, and conveyed by her to the foreſts of Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia, where he was brought up among the ſhepherds. But Jupiter aſſigned him a different partner, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to eſpouſe SORROW the daughter of Atè. He complied with reluctance; for her features were harſh and diſagreeable, her eyes ſunk, her forehead con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted into perpetual wrinkles, and her temples were covered with a wreath of cypreſs and wormwood.</p>
                  <p>From this union ſprung a virgin, in whom might be traced a ſtrong reſemblance to both her parents; but the ſullen and unamiable features of her mother were ſo
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:021451_0085_0FB3F6819D8A1E58"/>
mixed and blended with the ſweetneſs of her father, that her countenance, though mournful, was highly pleaſing. The maids and ſhepherds of the neighboring plains gathered round, and called her PITY. A red-breaſt was obſerved to build in the cabin where ſhe was born: and, while ſhe was yet an infant, a dove, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued by a hawk, flew into her boſom. This nymph had a dejected appearance; but ſo ſoft and gentle a mien, that ſhe was beloved to a degree of enthuſiaſm. Her voice was low and plaintive, but inexpreſſibly ſweet; and ſhe loved to lie, for hours together, on the banks of ſome wild and melancholy ſtream, ſinging to her lute. She taught men to weep, for ſhe took a ſtrange delight in tears; and often, when the virgins of the hamlet were aſſembled at their evening ſports, ſhe would ſteal in amongſt them, and captivate their hearts by her tales, full of a charming ſadneſs. She wore on her head a garland, compoſed of her father's myrtles, twiſted with her mother's cypreſs.</p>
                  <p>One day, as ſhe ſat muſing by the waters of Heli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, her tears by chance fell into the fountain; and ever ſince, the Muſe's ſpring has retained a ſtrong taſte of the infuſion. Pity was commanded by Jupiter to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſteps of her mother through the world, drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping balm into the wounds ſhe made, and binding up the hearts ſhe had broken. She follows with her hair looſe, her boſom bare and throbbing, her garments torn by the briars, and her feet bleeding with the roughneſs of the path. The nymph is mortal, for her mother is ſo; and when ſhe hes fulfilled her deſtined courſe upon the earth, they ſhall both expire together, and LOVE be again united to JOY, his immortal and long-betrothed bride.</p>

                  <p>THERE is no place in town which I ſo much love to frequent as the Royal Exchange. It gives me a ſecret ſatisfaction, and in ſome meaſure gratifies my va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity as an Engliſhman, to ſee ſo rich an aſſembly of my countrymen and foreigners conſulting together upon the private buſineſs of mankind, and making this metropolis a kind of emporium for the whole earth. I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:021451_0086_0FB3F6831BED5E48"/>
I look upon High Change to be a grand council, in which all conſiderable nations have their repreſentatives. Factors, in the trading world, are what ambaſſadors are in the politic world. They negociate affairs, conclude treaties, and maintain a good correſpondence between thoſe wealthy ſocieties of men that are divided from one another by ſeas and oceans, or live on the different ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities of a continent. I have often been pleaſed to hear diſputes adjuſted between an inhabitant of Japan and an alderman of London, or to ſee a ſubject of the Great Mogul entering into a league with one of the Czar of Muſcovy. I am infinitely delighted in mixing with theſe ſeveral miniſters of commerce, as they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by their different walks and different lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages. Sometimes I am joſtled among a body of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians; ſometimes I am loſt in a crowd of Jews; and ſometimes make one in a group of Dutchmen. I am a Dane, a Swede, or Frenchman, at different times; or rather fancy myſelf like the old philoſopher, who, upon being aſked what countryman he was, replied, That he was a citizen of the world.</p>
                  <p>Nature ſeemes to have taken a particular care to diſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate her bleſſings among the different regions of the world, with an eye to this mutual intercourſe and traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic among mankind, that the natives of the ſeveral parts of the globe might have a kind of dependence upon one another, and be united together by their common inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts. Almoſt every degree produces ſomething peculiar to it. The food often grows in one country and the ſauce in another. The fruits of Portugal are corrected by the products of Barbadoes; the infuſion of a China plant ſweetened with the pith of an Indian cane. The Philippine iſlands give a flavor to our European bowls. The ſingle dreſs of a woman of quality is often the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of an hundred climates. The muff and the fan come together from the different ends of the earth. The ſcarf is ſent from the torrid zone, and the tippet from beneath the pole.

                     </gap>ſtan.</p>
                  <p>If we conſider our own country in its natural proſpect, without any of the benefits and advantages of commerce,
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:021451_0087_0FB3F6849EB09528"/>
what a barren uncomfortable ſpot of earth falls to our ſhare? Natural hiſtorians tell us, that no fruit grows ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally among us beſides hips and haws, acorns and pig-nuts, with other delicacies of the like nature: that our climate, of itſelf, and without the aſſiſtance of art, can make no farther advances towards a plum than a ſloe, and carries an apple to no greater perfection than a crab: that our melons, our peaches, our figs, our apri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cots, and our cherries, are ſtrangers among us, import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in different ages, and naturalized in our Engliſh gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens; and that they would all degenerate and fall away into the traſh of our own country, if they were wholly neglected by the planter, and left to the mercy of our ſun and ſoil.</p>
                  <p>Nor has traffic more enriched our vegetable world than it has improved the whole face of nature among us. Our ſhips are laden with the harveſt of every climate; our tables are ſtored with ſpices, and oils, and wines; our rooms are filled with pyramids of china, and adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the workmanſhip of Japan; our morning's draught comes from the remoteſt corners of the earth: we repair our bodies by the drugs of America, and repoſe ourſelves under Indian canopies. My friend Sir Andrew calls the vineyards of France our gardens; the ſpice-iſlands, our hot-beds; the Perſians, our ſilk-weavers; and the Chineſe, our potters. Nature, indeed, furniſhes us with the bare neceſſaries of life; but traffic gives us a great variety of what is uſeful, and at the ſame time ſupplies us with every thing that is convenient and ornamental. Nor is it the leaſt part of this our happineſs, that, while we enjoy the remoteſt products of the north and ſouth, we are free from thoſe extremities of weather which give them birth; that our eyes are refreſhed with the green fields of Britain, at the ſame time that our palates are feaſted with fruits that riſe between the tropics.</p>
                  <p>For theſe reaſons, there are not more uſeful members in a commonwealth than merchants. They knit man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind together in a mutual intercourſe of good offices, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute the gifts of nature, find work for the poor, add wealth to the rich, and magnificence to the great. Our Engliſh merchant converts the tin of his own country in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to gold, and exchanges his wool for rubies.

                  <head>X. ON PUBLIC SPEAKING.</head>
                  <p>MOST foreign writers who have given any charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Engliſh nation, whatever vices they aſcribe to it, allow, in general, that the people are naturally modeſt. It proceeds, perhaps, from this our national virtue, that our orators are obſerved to make uſe of leſs geſture or action than thoſe of other countries. Our preachers ſtand ſtock-ſtill in the pulpit, and will not ſo much as move a finger to ſet off the beſt ſermons in the world. We meet with the ſame ſpeaking ſtatues at our bars, and in all public places of debate. Our words flow from us in a ſmooth continued ſtream, without thoſe ſtrainings of the voice, motions of the body, and majeſty of the hand, which are ſo much celebrated in the orators of Greece and Rome. We can talk of life and death in cold blood, and keep our temper in a diſcourſe which turns upon every thing that is dear to us. Though our zeal breaks out in the fineſt tropes and figures, it is not able to ſtir a limb about us.</p>
                  <p>It is certain that proper geſtures and exertions of the voice cannot be too much ſtudied by a public orator. They are a kind of comment to what he utters; and enforce every thing he ſays, with weak hearers, better than the ſtrongeſt argument he can make uſe of. They keep the audience awake, and fix their attention to what is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to them; at the ſame time that they ſhow the ſpeaker is in earneſt, and affected himſelf with what he ſo paſſionately recommends to others.</p>
                  <p>We are told, that the great Latin orator very much impaired his health by the vehemence of action with which he uſed to deliver himſelf. The Greek orator was likewiſe ſo very famous for this particular in rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric, that one of his antagoniſts, whom he had baniſhed from Athens, reading over the oration which had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured his baniſhment, and ſeeing his friends admire it, could not forbear aſking them, If they were ſo much affected by the bare reading of it, how much more they
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:021451_0089_0FB3F6879DAA67F8"/>
would have been alarmed, had they heard him actually throwing out ſuch a ſtorm of eloquence?</p>
                  <p>How cold and dead a figure, in compariſon of theſe two great men, does an orator often make at the Britiſh bar, holding up his head with the moſt inſipid ſerenity, and ſtroking the ſides of a long wig that reaches down to his middle?

                  <p>DURING the laſt war in America, a company of the Delaware Indians attacked a ſmall detachment of the Britiſh troops, and defeated them. As the Indians had greatly the advantage of ſwiftneſs of foot, and were eager in the purſuit, very few of the fugitives eſcaped; and thoſe who fell into the enemy's hands were treated with a cruelty of which there are not many examples even in that country. Two of the Indians came up with a young officer, and attacked him with great fury. As they were armed with a kind of battle-axe, which they call a tomahawk, he had no hope of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape, and thought only of ſelling his life as dearly as
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:021451_0090_0FB3F6891D3639C8"/>
he could: but juſt at this criſis another Indian came up, who ſeemed to be advanced in years, and was armed with a bow and arrows. The old man inſtantly drew his bow; but after having taken his aim at the officer, he ſuddenly dropped the point of his arrow, and interpoſed between him and his purſuers, who were about to cut him in pieces. They retired with reſpect. The old man then took the officer by the hand, ſoothed him into confidence by careſſes; and, having conducted him to his hut, treated him with a kindneſs which did honor to his profeſſions. He made him leſs a ſlave than a companion, taught him the language of the country, and inſtructed him in the rude arts that are practiſed by the inhabitants. They lived together in the moſt cordial amity; and the young officer found nothing to regret, but that ſometimes the old man fixed his eyes upon him, and, having regarded him for ſome minutes with a ſteady and ſilent attention, burſt into tears. In the mean time the ſpring returned; and the Indians having recourſe to their arms, again took the field. The old man, who was ſtill vigorous, and well able to bear the fatigues of war, ſet out with them, and was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by his priſoner. They marched above 200 leagues acroſs the foreſt, and came at length to a plain where the Britiſh forces were encamped.

his hands, ſtood ſome time ſilent; then looking ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly at his priſoner, he ſaid, in a voice that was at once ſoftened by tenderneſs and grief, "Haſt thou a father?" "My father," ſaid the young man, "was alive when I left my country." "Alas," ſaid the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, "how wretched muſt he be!" He pauſed a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and then added, "Doſt thou know that I have been a father?—I am a father no more—I ſaw my ſon fall in battle—he fought at my ſide—I ſaw him expire; but he died like a man.—He was covered with wounds when he fell dead at my feet—but I have revenged him!" He pronounced theſe words with the utmoſt vehemence; his body ſhook with an univerſal tremor; and he was almoſt ſtifled with ſighs that he would not ſuffer to eſcape him. There was a keen reſtleſsneſs in his eye; but no tear would flow to his relief. At length he became calm by degrees; and turning towards the eaſt, where the ſun was then riſing, "Doſt thou ſee," ſaid he to the young officer, "the beauty of that ſky, which ſparkles with prevailing day? and haſt thou pleaſure in the ſight?" "Yes," replied the young of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, "I have pleaſure in the beauty of ſo fine a ſky." "I have none," ſaid the Indian; and his tears then found their way. A few minutes after he ſhowed the young man a magnolia in full bloom. "Doſt thou ſee that beautiful tree?" ſays he: "and doſt thou look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it with pleaſure?" "Yes replied the officer, "I do look with pleaſure upon that beautiful tree."—"I have pleaſure in looking upon it no more," ſaid the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian haſtil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>AMONG other excellent arguments for the immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ſoul, there is one drawn from the perpetual progreſs of the ſoul to its perfection, without a poſſibility of ever arriving at it; which is a hint that I do not remember to have ſeen opened and improved by others who have written on this ſubject, though it ſeem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="93" facs="unknown:021451_0092_0FB3F68C1D23F600"/>
it enter into the thoughts of man, that the ſoul, which is capable of ſuch immenſe perfections, and of receiving new improvements to all eternity, ſhall fall away into nothing almoſt as ſoon as it is created! Are ſuch abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities made for no purpoſe? A brute arrives at a point of perfection that he can never paſs: in a few years he has all the endowments he is capable of; and were he to live ten thouſand more, would be the ſame thing he is at preſent. Were a human ſoul thus at a ſtand in her accompliſhments; were her faculties to be full blown, and incapable of farther enlargements; I could imagine it might fall away inſenſibly, and drop at once into a ſtate of annihilation. But can we believe a thinking being, that is in a perpetual progreſs of improvements, and travelling on from perfection to perfection, after having juſt looked abroad into the works of its Creator, and made a few diſcoveries of His infinite goodneſs, wiſdom, and power, muſt periſh at her firſt ſetting out, and in the very beginning of her inquiries?</p>
                  <p>Man, conſidered in his preſent ſtate, does not ſeem born to enjoy life, but to deliver it down to others. This is not ſurpriſing to conſider in animals, which are formed for our uſe, and can finiſh their buſineſs in a ſhort life. The ſilk-worm, after having ſpun her taſk, lays her eggs and dies. But in this life man can never take in his full meaſure of knowledge; nor has he time to ſubdue his paſſions, eſtabliſh his ſoul in virtue, and come up to the perfection of his nature, before he is hurried off the ſtage. Would an infinitely wiſe Being make ſuch glorious creatures for ſo mean a purpoſe? Can he delight in the production of ſuch abortive intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligences, ſuch ſhort-lived reaſonable beings? Would he give us talents that are not to be exerted? capacities that are never to be gratified? How can we find that wiſdom which ſhines through all his works, in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of man, without looking on this world as only a nurſery for the next; and believing that the ſeveral generations of rational creatures, which riſe up and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear in ſuch quick ſucceſſions, are only to receive their firſt rudiments of exiſtence here, and afterwards to be tranſplanted into a more friendly climate, where they may ſpread and flouriſh to all eternity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="94" facs="unknown:021451_0093_0FB3F68D9E56A5B8"/>There is not, in my opinion, a more pleaſing and triumphant conſideration in religion than this, of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual progreſs which the ſoul makes towards the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of its nature without ever arriving at a period in it. To look upon the ſoul as going on from ſtrength to ſtrength; to conſider that ſhe is to ſhine, with new acceſſions of glory, to all eternity; that ſhe will be ſtill adding virtue to virtue, and knowledge to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; carries in it ſomething wonderfully agreeable to that ambition which is natural to the mind of man. Nay, it muſt be a proſpect pleaſing to God himſelf, to ſee his creation for ever beautifying in his eyes, and drawing nearer to him, by greater degrees of reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance.</p>
                  <p>Methinks this ſingle conſideration, of the progreſs of a finite ſpirit to perfection, will be ſufficient to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh all envy in inferior natures, and all contempt in ſuperior. That cherubim, which now appears as a God to a human ſoul, knows very well that the period will come about in eternity, when the human ſoul ſhall be as perfect as he himſelf now is; nay, when ſhe ſhall look down upon that degree of perfection as much as ſhe now falls ſhort of it. It is true, the higher nature ſtill advances, and by that means preſerves his diſtance and ſuperiority in the ſcale of being; but he knows, that, how high ſoever the ſtation is of which he ſtands poſſeſſed at preſent, the inferior nature will at length mount up to it, and ſhine forth in the ſame degree of glory.</p>
                  <p>With what aſtoniſhment and veneration may we look into our ſouls, where there are ſuch hidden ſtores of virtue and knowledge, ſuch inexhauſted ſources of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection! We know not yet what we ſhall be, nor will it ever enter into the heart of man to conceive the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that will be always in reſerve for him. The ſoul, conſidered in relation to its Creator, is like one of thoſe mathematical lines that may draw nearer to another for all eternity, without a poſſibility of touching it: and can there be a thought ſo tranſporting, as to conſider ourſelves in theſe perpetual approaches to Him who is not only the ſtandard of perfection but of happineſs?</p>

                  <head>XIII. OF THE VOYAGE ROUND THE WORLD BY COMMODORE ANSON.</head>
                  <p>WHENEVER France or Spain happens to be at war with England, the ſhock given to Europe is felt at the extremities of the earth. If the induſtry and boldneſs of the modern nations of Europe give them an advantage over the reſt of the world, and over the ancients in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, it is owing to their maritime expeditions. Men are not ſo much ſurpriſed, as perhaps they ſhould be when they ſee come out of the ports of a few inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable provinces, unknown to the civilized nations of antiquity, fleets of ſuch a conſtruction, that a ſingle veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of them would have utterly deſtroyed all the ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the ancient Greeks and Romans. On the one hand, theſe fleets go beyond the Ganges, in order to engage each other in the view of the moſt powerful em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires, who ſtand by, the unconcerned ſpectators of the dire effects of an art which they have not hitherto ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired: On the other, they go beyond America, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with each other for ſlaves in the New World.</p>
                  <p>The ſucceſs is rarely proportionable to the greatneſs of the enterprizes; not only becauſe it is impoſſible to ſee all the obſtacles which may ariſe, but becauſe ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate means are ſcarce ever made uſe of.</p>
                  <p>Admiral Anſon's expedition proves, how much a man of ſenſe and reſolution may perform, though his prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations may be very inadequate to the danger of his undertaking.</p>
                  <p>Before ſo many nations had engaged in a war in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to decide whether the daughter of the Emperor Charles VI. ſhould ſucceed her father, there ſubſiſted a war between Spain and England about a ſhip: That war coſt both parties ten thouſand times more than the worth of what had given riſe to it.</p>
                  <p>The miniſtry of London, in the year 1739, ſent Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral Vernon to Mexico. He there deſtroyed Porto-Bello; but he failed in his attempt upon Carthagena. It was intended, at the ſame time, that George Anſon ſhould fall upon Peru by the South Sea, in order, if poſſible, to ruin, or at leaſt to weaken, the vaſt empire which Spain had acquired in that part of the world, by
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:021451_0095_0FB3F6909EED01E8"/>
both ends. Anſon was created commodore, that is, commander of a ſquadron; there were given to him five veſſels, a ſort of a ſmall frigate of eight guns with about one hundred men on board, and two ſhips loaded with proviſions and merchandiſe: theſe two ſhips were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to carry on commerce, under the protection of the convoy; for it is peculiar to the Engliſh nation to mix traffic with warlike operations. Aboard the ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron were fifteen hundred ſeamen, with two hundred and ſixty ſuperannuated invalids, and two hundred new-raiſed recruits. He ſteers his courſe to the iſland of Madeira, which belongs to Portugal; he advances to the iſles of Cape Verde, and ſails by the coaſt of Brazil. His crew refreſhed themſelves in a little iſland named St. Catharine, which is covered with never fading verdure, and abounds with fruit through every ſeaſon of the year. This iſland is twenty-ſeven de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees beyond the tropic of Cancer. The commodore, after having coaſted along the cold and uncultivated country of Patagonia, entered the Straits Le Maire about the end of February 1741; thus did he paſs above a hundred degrees of latitude in leſs than five months. The little ſloop or frigate of eight guns, named the Trial, was the firſt veſſel of the kind that ventured to double Cape Horn: She afterwards ſeized, in the South Sea, a Spaniſh ſhip of ſix hundred tons, the crew of which little expected to have been taken in the Pacific Ocean by a ſhip from England.</p>
                  <p>However, upon doubling Cape Horn, after having paſſed the Straits Le Maire, Anſon's ſquadron was ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and diſperſed by violent tempeſts. One half of the men aboard periſhed by an inveterate ſcurvy. The veſſel of the commodore, being ſeparated from the reſt, put in at the deſert iſland of Fernandes, which lies high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er up the South Sea towards the tropic of Capricorn. A rational reader, who beholds with horror the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious efforts which mortals make in order to render themſelves and their fellow-creatures unhappy, will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps receive ſome ſatisfaction upon being informed that George Anſon, finding the climate of this iſland ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding mild, and the ſoil equally fertile, ſowed in it pulſe and fruits, the ſeed of which he brought with him
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:021451_0096_0FB3F6921DB77F88"/>
from England; by which means it, in a ſhort time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a plentiful country. Certain Spaniards, who touched there ſome time after, being, in the courſe of the war carried priſoners into England, formed an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that Anſon alone was capable of repairing the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages of war by ſuch an attention to the general good of mankind, and returned him thanks as their benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. Let me be allowed to ſoften, by ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances as theſe, the melancholy tenor of hiſtory, which is almoſt one continued narrative of murders and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</p>
                  <p>Anſon, whoſe veſſel carried ſixty guns, being joined by another of his ſhips of war, and by the little frigate called the Trial, took ſeveral conſiderable prizes in crui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing near the iſland of Fernandes; but, having ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter advanced towards the Equator, he ventured to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack the town of Paita, upon the coaſt of America. He neither made uſe of his ſhips of war, nor of his men, in executing this bold and hazardous attempt: The expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition was performed by fifty ſoldiers in a boat with oars. They landed during the night. The ſudden ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, the confuſion, and the darkneſs, redoubled, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied, and increaſed the danger. The governor, the garriſon, and the inhabitants, fled on every ſide. In the mean time, the fifty Engliſh, without moleſtation, carried off the treaſures which they found in the cuſtom-houſe, and in private houſes, during the ſpace of three days. Some black ſlaves, a ſpecies of animals who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways become the property of the firſt that ſeize them, not having fled, aſſiſted the Engliſh in carrying off the wealth of their former maſters. Anſon cauſed Paita to be burnt to aſhes, and then ſet ſail; having plundered the Spnaiards with as much eaſe as they, in paſt ages, plundered the Americans. Spain loft fifteen hundred thouſand piaſters by the fire; the Engliſh gained about one hundred and eighty thouſand; which, added to the former captures, greatly enriched the ſquadron. The great number of men carried off by the ſcurvy, left the bulk of the treaſures to the ſurvivers. This little ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron came afterwards oppoſite to Panama, upon the coaſt where pearls are dived for, and advanced to Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulco, at the back of Mexico. The government of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:021451_0097_0FB3F6939BDF77B0"/>
was then not aware of the riſk it ran of loſing that vaſt region of the world. If Admiral Vernon, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged Carthagena upon the oppoſite ſea, had ſucceeded, he might have aſſiſted Commodore Anſon. Thus, the iſthmus of Panama would have been taken by the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, both upon the right and left, and the Spaniards deprived of the very center of their American domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>Anſon, who had but two ſhips remaining, the reſt having been deſtroyed by tempeſts, confined all his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes, and his ſanguine hopes, to the taking of a large galleon which Mexico ſends every year to the iſland of Manilla in the Chineſe ſeas. Manilla is one of the Philippine iſlands, ſo called becauſe they were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered during the reign of Philip II.</p>
                  <p>This galleon, laden with ſilver, would not have ſet ſail if the Engliſh had been ſeen upon the coaſts; and it did not leave the port till a conſiderable time after their departure. The commodore, therefore, croſſed the Pacific ocean, and all the climates between the Tropic and the Equator. Avarice, rendered honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by fatigue and danger, made him traverſe the globe with his two remaining men of war. The ſcurvy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to afflict the ſailors upon theſe ſeas; and, as one of the two veſſels leaked on every ſide, they were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to abandon and ſet fire to it, leſt the wreck ſhould be thrown upon ſome of the Spaniſh iſlands, and become of uſe to the inhabitants: The ſoldiers and ſailors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to this veſſel were taken on board Anſon's. At that time the only veſſel that was left of his whole ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron was his own ſhip, called the Centurion, which carried ſixty guns, and was accompanied by two ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. The Centurion eſcaped alone from ſo many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, but in a very ſhattered condition; and, having none but ſick men on board, very fortunately touched at one of the Marianne iſlands called Tinian, which was at that time quite uninhabited. Not long before, it contained no leſs than thirty thouſand ſouls; but the greateſt part of the inhabitants had been ſwept away by an epidemic diſeaſe, and the ſurvivers had been removed to another iſland by the Spaniards.</p>
                  <p>The crew owed its preſervation to the iſland of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian.
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:021451_0098_0FB3F6951E8A38D8"/>
That iſland, which ſurpaſſed Fernandes in ferti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, abounded on all ſides with wood, ſprings, and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulets, tame animals, fruits, pulſe, and every thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for food, the conveniencies of life, and for refit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the veſſel. But the moſt extraordinary thing found there, was a ſort of a tree, the taſte of whoſe fruit reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled that of the beſt bread, a real treaſure, which, if it could be tranſplanted to our climate, would be greatly preferable to thoſe riches, which owe all their worth to opinion, and which men go in queſt of to the end of the earth, through ſo many dangers and difficulties.</p>
                  <p>From this iſland he went to that of Formoſa; he then bent his courſe towards China, to Macao, at the entrance of the river Canton, in order to repair his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remaining veſſel.</p>
                  <p>The commodore, having completely refitted his ſhip at Macao by the aſſiſtance of the Chineſe, and having taken on board ſome Indian ſailors, and ſome Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, whom he thought to be uſeful men, put to ſea again.</p>
                  <p>At length, upon the ninth of June, 1743, the ſo much wiſhed-for Spaniſh ſhip was deſcried. It advanced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Manilla, having but ſixty-four guns; the crew conſiſted of five hundred and fifty men fit for action: the treaſure which it carried amounted only to about fifteen hundred thouſand piaſters in ſilver, with cochi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal and other merchandiſe; becauſe the whole trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which is generally double that ſum, had been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into two equal parts, and one half was carried by another galleon.</p>
                  <p>The commodore had but two hundred and forty men on board the Centurion. The captain of the galleon, perceiving the enemy, choſe rather to venture the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, than forfeit his reputation by flying before an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhman; for which reaſon, he hoiſted as much ſail as poſſible, in order to come up with and engage him.</p>
                  <p>The eager deſire of ſeizing riches, a paſſion much ſtronger than the principle of duty, which directs to preſerve them for the ſovereign, the experience of the Engliſh, and the ſkilful operations of the commodore, procured him the victory. Only two of his men were killed in the fight; the galleon loſt ſixty-ſeven, who
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:021451_0099_0FB3F696A64D3CA0"/>
were ſlain upon deck, and eighty-four were wounded. The number of his crew ſtill ſurpaſſed that of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore's: however, he thought proper to ſtrike. The conqueror returned to Canton with this rich prize. He there maintained the honor of his country, by refuſing to pay the impoſts exacted by the Emperor of China from all foreign ſhips: he inſiſted that a man of war was not ſubject to them. His conduct overawed the Chineſe. The governor of Canton gave him audience, to which he was conducted through two ranks of ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, whoſe number amounted to ten thouſand; after which he returned to his own country, by the Sunda iſlands and the Cape of Good Hope. Having thus ſailed round the world victorious, he landed in England the 4th of June 1744, after a voyage of three years and a half.</p>

                  <head>XIV. ON PEDANTRY.</head>
                  <p>PEDANTRY, in the common ſenſe of the word, means an abſurd oſtentation of learning, and ſtiffneſs of phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeology, proceeding from a miſguided knowledge of books, and a total ignorance of men.</p>
                  <p>But I have often thought, that we might extend its ſignification a good deal farther; and, in general, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it to that failing, which diſpoſes a perſon to obtrude upon others ſubjects of converſation relating to his own buſineſs, ſtudies, or amuſements.</p>
                  <p>In this ſenſe of the phraſe, we ſhould find pedants in every character and condition of life. Inſtead of a black coat and a plain ſhirt, we ſhould often ſee pedantry ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in an embroidered ſuit and Bruſſels lace; inſtead of being bedaubed with ſnuff, we ſhould find it breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perfumes; and, in place of a book-worm, crawling through the gloomy cloiſters of an univerſity, we ſhould mark it in the ſtate of a gilded butterfly, buzzing through the gay region of the drawing-room.</p>
                  <p>Robert Daiſy, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> is a pedant of this laſt kind. When he tells you that his ruffles coſt twenty guineas a pair; that his buttons were the firſt of the kind, made by one of the moſt eminent artiſts in Birmingham; that his buckles were procured by means of a friend at Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, and are the exact pattern of thoſe worn by the
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:021451_0100_0FB3F6981EAB3240"/>
Comte d' Artois; that the loop of his hat was of his own contrivance, and has ſet the faſhion to half a dozen of the fineſt fellows in town: when he deſcants on all theſe particulars, with that ſmile of ſelf-complacency which ſits for ever on his cheek, he is as much a pedant as his quondam tutor, who recites verſes from Pindar, tells ſtories from Herodotus, and talks for an hour on the energy of the Greek particles.</p>
                  <p>But Mr. Daiſy is ſtruck dumb by the approach of his brother Sir Thomas, whoſe pedantry goes a pitch higher, and pours out all the intelligence of France and Italy, whence the young Baronet is juſt returned, after a tour of fifteen months over all the kingdoms of the continent. Talk of muſic, he cuts you ſhort with the hiſtory of the firſt ſinger at Naples; of painting, he runs you down with a deſcription of the gallery at Florence; of architecture, he overwhelms you with the dimenſions of St Peter's, or the grand church at Antwerp; or, if you leave the province of art altogether, and introduce the name of a river or hill, he inſtantly deluges you with the Rhine, or makes you dizzy with the height of Aet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, or Mount Blanc.</p>
                  <p>Miſs will have no difficulty of owning her great aunt to be a pedant, when ſhe talks all the time of dinner on the compoſition of the pudding, or the ſeaſoning of the mince-pies; or enters into a diſquiſition on the figure of the damaſk table-cloth, with a word or two on the thrift of making one's own linen: but the young lady will be ſurpriſed when I inform her, that her own hiſtory of laſt Thurſday's aſſembly, with the epiſode of Lady Di's feather, and the digreſſion to the qualities of Mr Frizzle the hair-dreſſer, was alſo a piece of downright pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantry.</p>
                  <p>Mrs Caudle is guilty of the ſame weakneſs, when ſhe recounts the numberleſs witticiſms of her daughter Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, deſcribes the droll figure her little Bill made yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day at trying on his firſt pair of breeches, and informs us, that Bobby has got ſeven teeth, and is juſt cutting an eighth, though he will be but nine months old next Wedneſday at ſix o'clock in the evening. Nor is her pedantry leſs diſguſting, when ſhe proceeds to enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the virtues and good qualities of her huſband;
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:021451_0101_0FB3F6999D80DB40"/>
though theſe laſt ſpecies is ſo uncommon, that it may, perhaps, be admitted into converſation for the ſake of novelty.</p>
                  <p>There is pedantry in every diſquiſition, however ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterly it may be, that ſtops the general converſation of the company. When Silius delivers that ſort of lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he is apt to get into, though it is ſupported by the moſt extenſive information and the cleareſt diſcernment, it is ſtill pedantry; and, while I admire the talents of Silius, I cannot help being uneaſy at his exhibition of them. In the courſe of this diſſertation, the farther a man proceeds, the more he ſeems to acquire ſtrength and inclination for the progreſs. Laſt night, after ſupper, Silius began upon Proteſtantiſm, proceeded to the Iriſh maſſacre, went through the Revolution, drew the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of King William, repeated anecdotes of Schom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg, and ended at a quarter paſt twelve, by delineating the courſe of the Boyne, in half a bumper of port, upon my beſt table; which river, happening to overflow its banks, did infinite damage to my couſin Sophy's white ſattin petticoat.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, every thing, in this ſenſe of the word, is pedantry, which tends to deſtroy that equality of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation which is neceſſary to the perfect eaſe and good-humor of the company.

Now, converſation is one of thoſe good things of which our gueſts or companions are equally intitled to a ſhare, as of any other conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuent part of the entertainment; and it is as eſſential a want of politeneſs to engroſs the one as to monopolize the other.</p>

                  <head>XV. ON THE DEATH OF A YOUNG LADY.</head>
                  <p>THE conſideration of death has always been made uſe of, by the moraliſt and the divine, as a powerful incentive to virtue and piety. From the uncertainty of life, they have endeavored to ſink the eſtimation of its pleaſures; and if they could not ſtrip the ſeductions of vice of their preſent enjoyment, at leaſt to load them with the fear of their end.</p>
                  <p>Voluptuaries, on the other hand, have, from a ſimilar reflection, endeavored to enhance the value, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade to the enjoyment, of temporal delights. They have adviſed us to pluck the roſes which would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſoon wither of themſelves; to ſeize the moments which we could not long command; and, ſince time was unavoidably fleeting, to crown its flight with joy.</p>
                  <p>Of neither of theſe perſuaſives, whether of the moral or the licentious, the ſevere or the gay, have the effects been great. Life muſt neceſſarily conſiſt of active ſcenes, which exclude from its general tenor, the leiſure of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation and the influence of thought. The ſchemes of the buſy will not be checked by the uncertainty of their event, nor the amuſements of the diſſipated, be either controlled or endeared by the ſhortneſs of their dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Even the cell of the anchorite, and the cloiſter of the monk, have their buſineſs and their pleaſures; for ſtudy may become buſineſs, and abſtraction pleaſure, when they engage the mind and occupy the time. A man may even enjoy the preſent and forget the future, at the very moment in which he is writing of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificancy of the former and the importance of the latter.</p>
                  <p>It were eaſy to ſhow the wiſdom and benignity of Providence—Providence ever wiſe and benign—in this particular of our conſtitution; but it would be trite to repeat arguments too obvious not to have been often obſerved, and too juſt not to have been always allowed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="104" facs="unknown:021451_0103_0FB3F69C9E8AA250"/>But though neither the ſituation of the world, nor the formation of our minds, allow the thoughts of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity or death a conſtant or prevailing effect upon our lives, they may ſurely ſometimes, not unſeaſonably, preſs upon our imagination; even excluſive of their moral or religious uſe, there is a ſympathetic enjoyment which often makes it not only 'better,' but more delightful, 'to go the houſe of mourning, than to the houſe of feaſting.'</p>
                  <p>Perhaps I felt it ſo, when, but a few days ſince, I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the funeral of a young lady, who was torn, in the bloom of youth and beauty, from the arms of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who doted on her, of a family by whom ſhe was adored: I think I would not have exchanged my feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings at the time for all the mirth which gaiety could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire, or all the pleaſure which luxury could beſtow.</p>
                  <p>Maria was in her twentieth year. To the beauty of her form, and excellence of her natural diſpoſition, a parent equally indulgent and attentive had done the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt juſtice. To accompliſh her perſon, and to cultivate her mind, every endeavor had been uſed; and they had been attended with that ſucceſs which they commonly meet with when not prevented by miſtaken fondneſs or untimely vanity. Few young ladies have attracted more admiration; none ever felt it leſs: with all the charms of beauty, and the poliſh of education, the plaineſt were not leſs affected, nor the moſt ignorant leſs aſſuming. She died when every tongue was eloquent of her virtues, when every hope was ripening to reward them.</p>
                  <p>It is by ſuch private and domeſtic diſtreſſes, that the ſofter emotions of the heart are moſt ſtrongly excited. The fall of more important perſonages is commonly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from our obſervation; but even where it happens under our immediate notice, there is a mixture of other feelings by which our compaſſion is weakened. The eminently great, or extenſively uſeful, leave behind them a train of interrupted views and diſappointed expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by which the diſtreſs is complicated beyond the ſimplicity of pity. But the death of one who, like Maria, was to ſhed the influence of her virtues over the age of a father, and the childhood of her ſiſters, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to us a little view of family affliction, which every eye can perceive and every heart can feel. On ſcenes
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:021451_0104_0FB3F69E1E6AAAB8"/>
of public ſorrow and national regret, we gaze as upon thoſe gallery-pictures which ſtrike us with wonder and admiration: domeſtic calamity is like the miniature of a friend, which we wear in our boſoms, and keep for ſecret looks and ſolitary enjoyment.</p>
                  <p>The laſt time I ſaw Maria was in the midſt of a crowded aſſembly of the faſhionable and the gay, where ſhe fixed all eyes by the gracefulneſs of her motion, and the native dignity of her mein; yet ſo tempered was that ſuperiority which they conferred with gentleneſs and modeſty, that not a murmur was heard, either from the rivalſhip of beauty or the envy of homelineſs. From that ſcene, the tranſition was ſo violent to the hearſe and the pall, the grave and the ſod, that once or twice my imagination turned rebel to my ſenſes: I beheld the objects around me as the painting of a dream, and thought of Maria as ſtill living.</p>
                  <p>I was ſoon, however, recalled to the ſad reality. The figure of her father bending over the grave of his dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling child; the ſilent ſuffering compoſure in which his countenance was fixed; the tears of his attendants, whoſe grief was light, and capable of tears; theſe gave me back the truth, and reminded me that I ſhould ſee her no more. There was a flow of ſorrow with which I ſuffered myſelf to be borne along, with a melancholy kind of indulgence; but when her father dropped the cord with which he had helped to lay his Maria in the earth, its ſound on the coffin chilled my heart, and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror for a moment took place of pity!</p>
                  <p>It was but for a moment.—He looked eagerly into the grave; made one involuntary motion to ſtop the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtants who were throwing the earth into it; then ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly recollecting himſelf, claſped his hands together, threw up his eyes to heaven; and then firſt I ſaw a few tears drop from them. I gave language to all this. It ſpoke a leſſon of faith, and piety, and reſignation. I went away ſorrowful; but my ſorrow was neither un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentle nor unmanly: caſt on this world a glance rather of pity than of enmity; on the next, a look of humble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and hope!</p>

                  <p>POSTERITY admires, and will long admire, the awful remains of the amphitheatre of Titus, which ſo well deſerved the epithet of Coloſſal. It was a building of an elliptic figure, five hundred and ſixty-four feet in length, and four hundred and ſixty-ſeven in breadth; founded on fourſcore arches; and riſing, with four ſucceſſive or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of architecture, to the height of one hundred and forty feet. The outſide of the edifice was encruſted with marble, and decorated with ſtatues. The ſlopes of the vaſt concave which formed the inſide, were filled and ſurrounded with ſixty or eighty rows of ſeats of marble, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with cuſhions, and capable of receiving with eaſe above fourſcore thouſand ſpectators. Sixty-four vomito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries (for by that name the doors were aptly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed) poured forth the immenſe multitude; and the entrances, paſſages, and ſtair-caſes, were contrived with ſuch exquiſite ſkill, that each perſon, whether of the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Nothing was omitted which in any reſpect could be ſubſervient to the convenience and pleaſure of the ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators. They were protected from the ſun and rain by an ample canopy, occaſionally drawn over their heads. The air was continually refreſhed by the playing of fountains, and profuſely impregnated by the grateful ſcent of aromatics. In the centre of the edifice, the arena or ſtage was ſtrewed with the fineſt ſand, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively aſſumed the moſt different forms. At one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it ſeemed to riſe out of the earth like the garden of the Heſperides; at another, it exhibited the rugged rocks and caverns of Thrace. The ſubterraneous pipes conveyed an inexhauſtible ſupply of water; and what had juſt before appeared a level plain, might be ſuddenly converted into a wide lake, covered with armed veſſels, and repleniſhed with the monſters of the de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The poet who deſcribes the games of Carinus, in the character of a ſhepherd attracted to the capital by the fame of their magnificence, affirms, that the nets deſigned as a defence againſt the wild beaſts, were of gold wire; that the porticoes were gilded; and that the belt or circle, which divided the ſeveral ranks of ſpectators from each other, was ſtudded with a precious moſaic of beautiful ſtones.</p>

                     </gap>nity of the building, and the condition of the people who lie in it, are apt to fill the mind with a kind of melancholy, or rather thoughtfulneſs, that is not diſagreeable. I yeſterday paſſed a whole afternoon in the church-yard, the cloiſters, and the church, amuſing myſelf with the tomb-ſtones and inſcriptions which I met with in thoſe ſeveral regions of the dead. Moſt of them recorded nothing elſe of the buried perſon, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> that he was born upon one day, and died upon another; the whole hiſtory of his life being comprehended in theſe two circumſtances, that are common to all mankind. I could not but look upon thoſe regiſters of exiſtence, whether of braſs or marble, as a kind of ſatire upon the departed perſons, who had left no other memorial of themſelves, but that they were born, and that they died.</p>
                  <p>Upon my going into the church, I entertained myſelf with the digging of a grave; and ſaw, in every ſhovelful of it that was thrown up, the fragment of a bone or ſkull intermixed with a kind of freſh-mouldering earth, that, ſome time or other, had a place in the compoſition of an human body. Upon this, I began to conſider with myſelf, what innumerable multitudes of people lay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed together, under the pavement of that ancient ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral how men and women, friends and enemies,
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:021451_0107_0FB3F6A29E49B538"/>
prieſts and ſoldiers, monks and prebendaries, were crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled amongſt one another, and blended together in the ſame common maſs; how beauty, ſtrength, and youth, with old age, weakneſs, and deformity, lay undiſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed in the ſame promiſcuous heap of matter.</p>
                  <p>After having thus ſurveyed this great magazine of mortality as it were in the lump, I examined it more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly by the accounts which I found on ſeveral of the monuments which are raiſed in every quarter of that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient fabric. Some of them were covered wich ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant epitaphs, that, if it were poſſible for the dead perſon to be acquainted with them, he would bluſh at the praiſes which his friends have beſtowed upon him. There are others ſo exceſſively modeſt, that they deliver the character of the perſon departed in Greek or He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, and by that means are not underſtood once in a twelve month. In the poetical quarter, I found there were poets who had no monuments, and monuments which had no poets. I obſerved, indeed, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent war had filled the church with many of thoſe unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited monuments, which had been erected to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of perſons whoſe bodies were perhaps buried in the pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>I could not but be very much delighted with ſeveral modern epitaphs, which are written with great elegance of expreſſion and juſtneſs of thought, and which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do honor to the living as well as to the dead. As a foreigner is very apt to conceive an idea of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or politeneſs of a nation from the turn of their public monuments and inſcriptions, they ſhould be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the peruſal of men of learning and genius, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are put into execution.

reap any honor. The Dutch, whom we are apt to deſpiſe for want of genius, ſhow an infinitely greater taſte in their buildings and works of this nature, than we meet with in thoſe of our own country. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of their admirals, which have been erected at the public expence, repreſent them like themſelves, and are adorned with roſtral crowns and naval ornaments, with beautiful feſtoons of ſea-weed, ſhells, and coral.</p>
                  <p>I know that entertainments of this nature are apt to raiſe dark and diſmal thoughts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in timorous minds and gloomy imaginations: but, for my own part, though I am always ſerious, I do not know what it is to be me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy; and can therefore take a view of nature in her deep and ſolemn ſcenes, with the ſame pleaſure as in her moſt gay and delightful ones. By theſe means, I can improve myſelf with objects which others conſider with terror.—When I look upon the tombs of the great, every emotion of envy dies in me; when I read the epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphs of the beautiful, every inordinate deſire goes out; when I meet with the grief of parents upon a tomb-ſtone, my heart melts with compaſſion; when I ſee the tomb of the parents themſelves, I conſider the vanity of grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving after thoſe whom we muſt quickly follow. When I ſee kings lying by thoſe who depoſed them; when I conſider rival wits placed ſide by ſide, or the holy men that divided the world with their conteſts and diſputes; I reflect with ſorrow and aſtoniſhment on the little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions, factions, and debates of mankind.

No ſtranger, on ſome occaſions, to diſſimulation: which, in that perfidious court where ſhe received her education, was reckoned among the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary arts of government. Not inſenſible to flattery, or unconſcious of that pleaſure with which almoſt every wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man beholds the influence of her own beauty. Formed with the qualities that we love, not with the talents that we admire, ſhe was an agreeable woman rather than an illuſtrious queen.</p>
                  <p>The vivacity of her ſpirit, not ſufficiently tempered with ſound judgment, and the warmth of her heart, which was not at all times under the reſtraint of diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, betrayed her both into errors and into crimes. To ſay that ſhe was always unfortunate, will not account for that long and almoſt uninterrupted ſucceſſion of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities which befel her; we muſt likewiſe add, that ſhe was often imprudent. Her paſſion for Darnly was raſh, youthful, and exceſſive. And, though the ſudden tranſition to the oppoſite extreme was the natural effect of her ill-requited love, and of his ingratitude, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and brutality; yet neither theſe, nor Bothwell's artful addreſs and important ſervices, can juſtify her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to that nobleman. Even the manners of the age, licentious as they were, are no apology for this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy paſſion; nor can they induce us to look on that tragical and infamous ſcene which followed upon it, with leſs abhorrence. Humanity will draw a veil over this part of her character, which it cannot approve; and may perhaps prompt ſome to impute her actions to her ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, more than to her diſpoſition; and to lament the unhappineſs of the former, rather than accuſe the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſs of the latter. Mary's ſufferings exceed, both in degree and in duration, thoſe tragical diſtreſſes which fancy has feigned to excite ſorrow and commiſeration; and while we ſurvey them, we are apt altogether to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get her frailties: we think of her faults with leſs indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and approve of our tears, as if they were ſhed for a perſon who had attained much nearer to pure vir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tue.</p>

The unuſual length of her adminiſtration, and the ſtrong features of her character, were able to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome all prejudices; and, obliging her detractors to abate much of their invectives, and her admirers ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of their panegyrics, have at laſt, in ſpite of politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal factions, and, what is more, of religious animoſities, produced an uniform judgment with regard to her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. Her vigor, her conſtancy, her magnanimity, her penetration, vigilance, and addreſs, are allowed to merit the higheſt praiſes, and appear not to have been ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by any perſon who ever filled a throne: a conduct leſs rigorous, leſs imperious, more ſincere, more indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to her people, would have been requiſite to form a perfect character. By the force of her mind, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolled all her more active and ſtronger qualities, and prevented them from running into exceſs. Her heroiſm was exempted from all temerity, her frugality from ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, her friendſhip from partiality, her enterpriſe from
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:021451_0111_0FB3F6A8A2DFFA80"/>
turbulency and a vain ambition: ſhe guarded not herſelf, with equal care or equal ſucceſs, from leſſer infirmities; the rivalſhip of beauty, the deſire of admiration, the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy of love, and the ſallies of anger.</p>
                  <p>Her ſingular talents for government were founded equally on her temper and on her capacity. Endowed with a great command over herſelf, ſhe ſoon obtained an uncontrolled aſcendant over the people, and while ſhe merited all their eſteem by her real virtue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, ſhe alſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged their affection by her pretended ones. Few ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns of England ſucceeded to the throne in more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult circumſtances, and none ever conducted the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment with ſuch uniform ſucceſs and felicity. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hough unacquainted with the practice of toleration, the true ſecret for managing religious factions, ſhe preſerved her people, by her ſuperior prudence, from thoſe confuſions in which theological controverſy had involved all the neighboring nations: and though her enemies were the moſt powerful princes of Europe, the moſt active, the moſt enterpriſing, the leaſt ſcrupulous, ſhe was able, by her vigor, to make deep impreſſions on their ſtate; her own greatneſs, meanwhile, remaining untouched and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>impaired.</p>
                  <p>The wiſe miniſters and brave warriors who flouriſhed during her reign ſhare the praiſe of her ſucceſs; but, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of leſſening the applauſe due to her, they make great addition to it. They owed, all of them, their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement to her choice; they were ſupported by her conſtancy; and, with all their ability, they were never able to acquire an undue aſcendant over her. In her family, in her court, in her kingdom, ſhe remained equally miſtreſs. The force of the tender paſſions was great over her, but the force of her mind was ſtill ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior; and the combat which her victory viſibly coſt her, ſerves only to diſplay the firmneſs of her reſolution, and the loftineſs of her ambitious ſentiments.</p>
                  <p>The fame of this princeſs, though it has ſurmounted the prejudices both of faction and of bigotry, yet lies ſtill expoſed to another predjudice, which is more durable, becauſe more natural; and which, according to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent views in which we ſurvey her, is capable either of exalting beyond meaſure, or diminiſhing, the luſtre of
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:021451_0112_0FB3F6AA1DC50860"/>
her character. This prejudice is founded on the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of her ſex. When we contemplate her as a woman, we are apt to be ſtruck with the higheſt admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of her qualities and extenſive capacity; but we are alſo apt to require ſome more ſoftneſs of diſpoſition, ſome greater lenity of temper, ſome of thoſe amiable weakneſſes by which her ſex is diſtinguiſhed. But the true method of eſtimating her merit, is to lay aſide all theſe conſiderations, and to conſider her merely as a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional being, placed in authority, and intruſted with the government of mankind. We may find it difficult to reconcile our fancy to her as a wife or a miſtreſs; but her qualities as a ſovereign, though with ſome conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able exceptions, are the object of undiſputed applauſe and approbation.</p>

                  <head>V. CHARLES V.'s RESIGNATION of his DOMINIONS.</head>
                  <p>CHARLES reſolved to reſign his kingdoms to his ſon, with a ſolemnity ſuitable to the importance of the tranſaction; and to perform this laſt act of ſovereignty with ſuch formal pomp, as might leave an indelible im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on the mind not only of his ſubjects, but of his ſucceſſor. With this view, he called Philip out of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; where the peeviſh temper of his queen, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed with her deſpair of having iſſue, rendered him extremely unhappy, and the jealouſy of the Engliſh left him no hopes of obtaining the direction of their affairs. Having aſſembled the ſtates of the Low Countries at Bruſſels, on the twenty-fifth of October one thouſand five hundred and fifty-five, Charles ſeated himſelf for the laſt time in the chair of ſtate; on one ſide of which was placed his ſon, and on the other his ſiſter the queen of Hungary, regent of the Netherlands; with a ſplendid retinue of the grandees of Spain, and princes of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire ſtanding behind him. The preſident of the council of Flanders, by his command, explained, in a few words, his intention in calling this extraordinary meeting of the ſtates. He then read the inſtrument of reſignation, by which Charles ſurrendered to his ſon Philip all his ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, juriſdiction, and authority in the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; abſolving his ſubjects there from their oath of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance to him, which he required them to transfer to
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:021451_0113_0FB3F6AB9E651508"/>
Philip his lawful heir, and to ſerve him with the ſame loyalty and zeal which they had manifeſted, during ſo long a courſe of years, in ſupport of his government.</p>
                  <p>Charles then roſe from his ſeat, and leaning on the ſhoulder of the prince of Orange, becauſe he was unable to ſtand without ſupport, he addreſſed himſelf to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; and, from a paper which he held in his hand in order to aſſiſt his memory, he recounted with dignity, but without oſtentation, all the great things which he had undertaken and performed ſince the commencement of his adminiſtration. He obſerved, that, from the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth year of his age he had dedicated all his thoughts and attention to public objects, reſerving no portion of his time for the indulgence of his eaſe, and very little for the enjoyment of private pleaſure: that, either in a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cific or hoſtile manner, he had viſited Germany nine times, Spain ſix times, France four times, Italy ſeven times, the Low Countries ten times, England twice, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica as often, and had made eleven voyages by ſea: that, while his health permitted him to diſcharge his duty, and the vigor of his conſtitution was equal in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to the arduous office of governing ſuch exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive dominions, he had never ſhunned labor, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pined under fatigue: that, now, when his health was broken, and his vigor exhauſted by the rage of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable diſtemper, his growing infirmities admoniſhed him to retire; nor was he ſo fond of reigning as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the ſceptre in an impotent hand, which was no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er able to protect his ſubjects, or to render them happy: that, inſtead of a ſovereign worn out with diſeaſes and ſcarcely half alive, he gave them one in the prime of life, accuſtomed already to govern, and who added to the vigor of youth all the attention and ſagacity of maturer years: that if, during the courſe of a long ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, he had committed any material error in government, or if, under the preſſure of ſo many and great affairs, and amidſt the attention which he had been obliged to give them, he had either neglected or injured any of his ſubjects, he now implored their forgiveneſs: that, for his part, he ſhould ever retain a grateful ſenſe of their fidelity and attachment, and would carry the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of it along with him to the place of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat,
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:021451_0114_0FB3F6AD1EB54460"/>
as his ſweeteſt conſolation, as well as the beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for all his ſervices; and, in his laſt prayers to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, would pour forth his ardent wiſhes for their welfare.</p>
                  <p>Then, turning towards Philip, who fell on his knees and kiſſed his father's hand, "If," ſays he, "I had left you, by my death, this rich inheritance, to which I have made ſuch large additions, ſome regard would have been juſtly due to my memory on that account; but now, when I voluntarily reſign to you what I might have ſtill retained, I may well expect the warmeſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of thanks on your part. With theſe, however, I diſpenſe; and ſhall conſider your concern for the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of your ſubjects, and your love of them, as the beſt and moſt acceptable teſtimony of your gratitude to me. It is in your power, by a wiſe and virtuous adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to juſtify the extraordinary proof which I this day give of my paternal affection, and to demonſtrate that you are worthy of the confidence which I repoſe in you. Preſerve an inviolable regard for religion; maintain the Catholic faith in its purity; let the laws of your country be ſacred in your eyes; encroach not on the rights and privileges of your people; and, if the time ſhall ever come when you ſhall wiſh to enjoy the tranquillity of private life, may you have a ſon, endowed with ſuch qualities that you can reſign your ſceptre to him, with as much ſatisfaction as I give up mine to you."</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as Charles had finiſhed this long addreſs to his ſubjects and to their new ſovereign, he ſunk into the chair, exhauſted and ready to die with the fatigue of ſuch an extraordinary effort. During his diſcourſe, the whole audience melted into tears; ſome, from admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his magnanimity; others, ſoftened by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of tenderneſs towards his ſon and of love to his people; and all were affected with the deepeſt ſorrow at loſing a ſovereign, who had diſtinguiſhed the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, his native country, with particular marks of his regard and attachment.</p>
                  <p>A few weeks thereafter, Charles, in an aſſembly no leſs ſplendid, and with a ceremonial equally pompous, reſigned to his ſon the crowns of Spain, with all the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories depending on them, both in the old and in the
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:021451_0115_0FB3F6AEA06E0850"/>
new world. Of all theſe paſt poſſeſſions, he reſerved nothing for himſelf but an annual penſion of an hundred thouſand crowns, to defray the charges of his family, and to afford him a ſmall ſum for acts of beneficence and charity.</p>
                  <p>The place he had choſen for his retreat was the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery of St Juſtus, in the province of Eſtremadura. It was ſeated in a vale of no great extent, watered by a ſmall brook, and ſurrounded by riſing grounds covered with lofty trees. From the nature of the ſoil, as well as the temperature of the climate, it was eſteemed the moſt healthful and delicious ſituation in Spain. Some months before his reſignation, he had ſent an architect thither to add a new apartment to the monaſtery for his accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation; but he gave ſtrict orders that the ſtile of the building ſhould be ſuch as ſuited his preſent ſituation, rather than his former dignity. It conſiſted only of ſix rooms; four of them in the form of friars cells, with na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked walls; the other two, each twenty feet ſquare, were hung with brown cloth, and furniſhed in the moſt ſimple manner. They were all on a level with the ground; with a door on one ſide into a garden, of which Charles himſelf had given the plan, and which he had filled with various plants, intending to cultivate them with his own hands. On the other ſide they communicated with the chapel of the monaſtery, in which he was to perform his devotions.—Into this humble retreat, hardly ſufficient for the comfortable accommodation of a private gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, did Charles enter with twelve domeſtics only. He buried there, in ſolitude and ſilence, his grandeur, his ambition, together with all thoſe vaſt projects, which, during half a century, had alarmed and agitated Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, filling every kingdom in it by turns with the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of his arms, and the dread of being ſubjected to his power.</p>

on power, but the guide of all power. Virtue is the foundation of honor and eſteem, and the fource of all beauty, order, and happineſs, in nature. It is what confers value on all the other endowments and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of a reaſonable being, to which they ought to be abſolutely ſubſervient; and without which, the more eminent they are, the more hideous deformities and the greater curſes they become.</p>
                  <p>The uſe of it is not confined to any one ſtage of our exiſtence, or to any particular ſituation we can be in, but reaches through all the periods and circumſtances of our being. Many of the endowments and talents we now poſſeſs, and of which we are too apt to be proud, will ceaſe entire<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y with the preſent ſtate; but this will be our ornament and dignity, in every future ſtate to which we may be removed. Beauty and wit will die, learning will vaniſh away, and all the arts of life be ſoon forgot; but virtue will remain for ever. This unites us to the whole rational creation; and fits us for conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with any order of ſuperior natures, and for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> place in any part of God's works. It procures us the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation and love of all wiſe and good beings, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>enders them our allies and friends. But what is of unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably greater conſequence is, that it makes God our friend, aſſimilates and unites our minds to him, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages his Almighty power in our defence. Superior beings of all ranks are bound by it no leſs than ourſelves. It has the ſame authority in all worlds that it has in this. The further any being is advanced in excellence and perfection, the greater is his attachment to it, and the more he is under its influence.—To ſay no more, it is the law of the whole univerſe, it ſtands firſt in the eſtimation of the Deity, its original is his nature, and it is the very object that makes him lovely.</p>
                  <p>Such is the importance of virtue.—Of what conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, therefore, is it that we practiſe it! There is no argument or motive in any reſpect fitted to influence a reaſonable mind, which does not call us to this. One virtuous diſpoſition of ſoul is preferable to the greateſt natural accompliſhments and abilities, and of more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue than all the treaſures of the world.—If you are wiſe, then, ſtudy virtue, and contemn every thing that

can come in competition with it. Remember, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe deſerves one anxious thought or wiſh. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that this alone is honor, glory, wealth, and happineſs. Secure this, and you ſecure every thing. Loſs this, and all is loſt.</p>

                  <head>VII. ADDRESS TO ART.</head>
                  <p>O ART! thou diſtinguiſhing attribute and honor of human kind! who art not only able to imitate nature in her graces, but even to adorn her with graces of thine own! Poſſeſſed of thee, the meaneſt genius grows deſerving, and has a juſt demand for a portion of our eſteem: devoid of thee, the brighteſt of our kind lie loſt and uſeleſs, and are but poorly diſtinguiſhed from the moſt deſpicable and baſe. When we inhabited foreſts in common with brutes, nor otherwiſe known from them than by the figure of our ſpecies, thou taughteſt us to aſſert the ſovereignty of our nature, and to aſſume that empire for which providence intended us. Thouſands of utilities owe their birth to thee; thouſands of elegancies, pleaſures, and joys, without which life itſelf would be but an inſipid poſſeſſion.</p>
                  <p>Wide and extenſive is the reach of thy dominion. No element is there, either ſo violent or ſo ſubtle, ſo yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or ſo ſluggiſh, as, by the powers of its nature, to be ſuperior to thy direction. Thou dreadeſt not the fierce impetuoſity of Fire, but compelleſt its violence to be both obedient and uſeful. By it thou ſofteneſt the ſtubborn tribe of minerals, ſo as to be formed and moulded into ſhapes innumerable. Hence weapons, armor, coin: and, previous to theſe and other thy works and ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, hence all thoſe various tools and inſtruments, which empower thee to proceed to farther ends more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent. Nor is the ſubtle Air leſs obedient to thy power, whether thou willeſt it to be a miniſter to our pleaſure or utility. At they command, it giveth birth to ſounds, which charm the ſoul with all the powers of harmony. Under thy inſtruction, it moves the ſhip over ſeas; while that yielding element, where otherwiſe we ſink, even Water itſelf, is by thee taught to bear us; the vaſt ocean, to promote that intercourſe of nations which ignorance would imagine it was deſtined to intercept.
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:021451_0118_0FB3F6B31E34F8A0"/>
To ſay how thy influence is ſeen on Earth, would be to teach the meaneſt what he knows already. Suffice it but to mention, fields of arable and paſture; lawns, and groves, and gardens, and plantations; cottages, villages, caſtles, towns; palaces, temples, and ſpacious cities.</p>
                  <p>Nor does thy empire end in ſubjects thus inanimate. Its power alſo extends through the various race of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, who either patiently ſubmit to become thy ſlaves, or are ſure to find thee an irreſiſtible foe. The faithful dog, the patient ox, the generous horſe, and the mighty elephant, are content all to receive their inſtructions from thee, and readily to lend their natural inſtincts or ſtrength to perform thoſe offices which thy occaſions call for. If there be found any ſpecies which are ſerviceable when dead, thou ſuggeſteſt the means to inveſtigate and take them: if any be ſo ſavage as to refuſe being tamed, or of natures fierce enough to venture an attack, thou teacheſt us to ſcorn their brutal rage, to meet, repel, purſue, and conquer.</p>
                  <p>Such, O Art! is thy amazing influence, when thou art employed only on theſe inferior ſubjects, on nature inanimate, or at beſt irrational. But, whenever thou chooſeſt a ſubject more noble, and ſetteſt to the cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Mind itſelf, then 'tis thou becomeſt truly amiable and divine, the ever-flowing ſource of thoſe ſublimer beauties of which no ſubject but mind alone is capable. Then 'tis thou art enabled to exhibit to mankind the admired tribes of poets and orators, the ſacred train of patriots and heroes, the god-like liſt of philoſophers and legiſlators, the forms of virtuous and equal polities, where private welfare is made the ſame with public, where crowds themſelves prove diſintereſted, and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is made a national and popular characteriſtic.</p>
                  <p>Hail! ſacred ſource of all theſe wonders! Thyſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct me to praiſe thee worthily; through whom, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we do, is done with elegance and beauty; without whom, what we do is ever graceleſs and deformed.— Venerable power! by what name ſhall I addreſs thee?

                  <p>FLATTERY is a manner of converſation very ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in itſelf, but beneficial to the flatterer.</p>
                  <p>If a flatterer is upon a public walk with you, "Do but mind," ſays he, "how every one's eye is upon you. Sure there is not a man in Athens that is taken ſo much notice of. You had juſtice done you yeſterday in the portico. There were above thirty of us together; and, the queſtion being ſtarted who was the moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſon in the commonwealth? the whole company was of the ſame ſide. In ſhort, Sir, every one made familiar with your name" He follows this whiſper with a thouſand other flatteries of the ſame nature.</p>
                  <p>Whenever the perſon to whom he would make his court begins to ſpeak, the ſycophant begs the company to be ſilent, moſt impudently praiſes him to his face, in raptures all the while he talks, and, as ſoon as he has done, cries out, That is perfectly right! When his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron aims at being witty upon any man, he is ready to burſt at the ſmartneſs of his raillery, and ſtops his mouth with his handkerchief that he may not laugh out. If he calls his children about him, the flatterer has a poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket full of apples for them, which he diſtributes among them with a great deal of fondneſs, wonders to ſee ſo many fine boys, and, turning about to the father, tells him they are all as like him as they can ſtare.</p>
                  <p>When he is invited to a feaſt, he is the firſt man that calls for a glaſs of wine, and is wonderfully pleaſed with the deliciouſneſs of the flavor; gets as near as poſſible to the man of the houſe, and tells him with much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern that he eats nothing himſelf. He ſingles out ſome particular diſh, and recommends it to the reſt of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany for a rarity. He deſires the maſter of the feaſt to ſit in a warmer part of the room, begs him to take more care of his health, and adviſes him to put on a ſupernu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merary garment in this cold weather. He is in a cloſe whiſper with him during the whole entertainment, and
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:021451_0120_0FB3F6B61EDF61A0"/>
has neither eyes nor ears for any one elſe in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
                  <p>If a man ſhows him his houſe, he extols the architect, admires the gardens, and expatiates upon the furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. If the owner is groſsly flattered in a picture, he outflatters the painter; and, though he diſcovers a great likeneſs in it, can by no means allow that it does juſtice to the original.—In ſhort, his whole buſineſs is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratiate himſelf with thoſe who hear him, and to wheedle them out of their ſenſes.</p>

                  <p>When he is dreſſed, goes to court; comes into the drawing-room; and, walking upright under a branch of candleſticks, his wig is caught up by one of them, and hangs dangling in the air. All the courtiers fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laughing; but Menalcas laughs louder than any of them, and looks about for the perſon that is the jeſt of the company. Coming down to the court-gate, he finds a coach; which, taking for his own, he whips into it; and the coachman drives off, not doubting but he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries his maſter. As ſoon as he ſtops, Menalcas throws himſelf out of the coach, croſſes the court, aſcends the ſtair-caſe, and runs through all the chambers with the greateſt familarity, repoſes himſelf on a couch, and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies himſelf at home. The maſter of the houſe at laſt comes in. Menalcas riſes to receive him, and deſires him to ſit down. He talks, muſes, and then talks again. The gentleman of the houſe is tired and amazed. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalcas is no leſs ſo; but is every moment in hopes that his impertinent gueſt will at laſt end his tedious viſit. Night comes on, when Menalcas is hardly convinced.</p>
                  <p>When he is playing at backgammon, he calls for a full glaſs of wine and water. It is his turn to throw. He has the box in one hand, and his glaſs in the other; and, being extremely dry and unwilling to loſe time, he ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:021451_0121_0FB3F6B79D7C4378"/>
down both the dice, and at the ſame time throws his wine into the tables. He writes a letter, and flings the ſand into the ink-bottle. He writes a ſecond, and miſtakes the ſuperſcription. A nobleman receives one of them, and, upon opening it, reads as follows: "I would have you, honeſt Jack, immediately upon the receipt of this, take in hay enough to ſerve the winter." His farmer receives the other, and is amazed to ſee in it, "My Lord, I received your Grace's commands."</p>
                  <p>If he is at an entertainment, you may ſee the pieces of bread continually multiplying round his plate: it is true the company want it, as well as their knives and forks, which Menalcas does not let them keep long. Sometimes in a morning he puts his whole family in a hurry, and at laſt goes out without being able to ſtay for his coach or breakfaſt; and, for that day, you may ſee him in every part of the town, except the very place where he had appointed to be upon buſineſs of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.</p>
                  <p>You would often take him for every thing that he is not—For a fellow quite ſtupid, for he hears nothing; for a fool, for he talks to himſelf, and has a hundred grimaces and motions with his head which are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther involuntary; for a proud man, for he looks full up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, and takes no notice of your ſaluting him. The truth of it is, his eyes are open, but he makes no uſe of them, and neither ſees you, nor any man, nor any thing elſe. He came once from his country-houſe, and his own footmen undertook to rob him, and ſucceeded. They held a flambeau to his throat, and bid him deliver his purſe. He did ſo: and coming home, told his friends he had been robbed. They deſire to know the particulars—"Aſk my ſervants," ſaid Menalcas; "for they were with me."</p>

                  <head>X. THE MONK.</head>
                  <p>A POOR monk of the order of St Francis came into the room to beg ſomething for his convent. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I caſt my eyes upon him, I was determined not to give him a ſingle ſous; and accordingly I put my purſe into my pocket—buttoned it up—ſet myſelf a little more upon my center, and advanced up gravely to
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:021451_0122_0FB3F6B91F99D418"/>
him: there was ſomething, I fear forbidding in my look: I have his figure this moment before my eyes, and think there was that in it which deſerved better.</p>
                  <p>The monk, as I judged from the break in his tonſure, a few ſcattered white hairs upon his temples being all that remained of it, might be about ſeventy—but from his eyes, and that ſort of fire which was in them, which ſeemed more tempered by courteſy than years, he could be no more than ſixty—Truth might lie between—He was certainly ſixty-five; and the general air of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, notwithſtanding ſomething ſeemed to have been planting wrinkles in it before their time, agreed to the account.</p>
                  <p>It was one of thoſe heads which Guido has often painted—mild, pale,—penetrating; free from all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-place ideas of fat contented ignorance looking down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards upon the earth—it looked forwards; but looked as if it looked at ſomething beyond this world. How one of his order came by it, Heaven above, who let it fall upon a monk's ſhoulders, beſt knows; but it would have ſuited a Bramin; and had I met it upon it the plains of Indoſtan, I had reverenced it.</p>
                  <p>The reſt of his outline may be given in a few ſtrokes: one might put it into the hands of any one to deſign; for it was neither elegant nor otherwiſe, but as charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and expreſſion made it ſo; it was a thin, ſpare form, ſomething above the common ſize, if it loſt not the diſtinction by a bend forwards in the figure—but it was the attitude of intreaty; and, as it now ſtands preſent to my imagination, it gained more than it loſt by it.</p>
                  <p>When he had entered the room three paces, he ſtood ſtill; and, lying his left hand upon his breaſt (a ſlender white ſtaff with which he journeyed being in his right) —when I had got cloſe up to him, he introduced him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the little ſtory of the wants of his convent, and the poverty of his order—and did it with ſo ſimple a grace—and ſuch an air of deprecation was there in the whole caſt of his look and figure—I was bewitched not to have been ſtruck with it—</p>
                  <p>—A better reaſon was, I had pre-determined not to give him a ſingle ſous.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="124" facs="unknown:021451_0123_0FB3F6BAB5664DA8"/>—'Tis very true, ſaid I, replying to a caſt upward<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with his eyes, with which he had concluded his addreſs, —'tis very true—and heaven be their reſource who have no other but the charity of the world; the ſtock of which, I fear, is no way ſufficient for the many GREAT CLAIMS which are hourly made upon it.</p>
                  <p>As I pronounced the words GREAT CLAIMS, he gave a ſlight glance with his eye downwards upon the ſleeve of his tunic—I felt the full force of the appeal—I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it, ſaid I—a coarſe habit, and that but once in three years, with meagre diet—are no great matters: and the true point of pity is, as they can be earned in the world with ſo little induſtry, that your order ſhould wiſh to procure them by preſſing upon a fund which is the property of the lame, the blind, the aged, and the infirm: the captive who lies down counting over and over again the days of his afflictions, languiſhes alſo for his ſhare of it; and had you been of the ORDER OF MERCY inſtead of the order of St. Francis, poor as I am, continued I, pointing at my portmanteau, full cheerfully ſhould it have been opened to you for the ranſom of the unfortunate. The monk made me a bow.—But, re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſumed I, the unfortunate of our own country, ſurely, have the firſt rights; and I have left thouſands in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs upon the Engliſh ſhore—The monk gave a cordial wave with his head—as much as to ſay, No doubt, there is miſery enough in every corner of the world, as well as within our convent.—But we diſtinguiſh, ſaid I, laying my hand upon the ſleeve of his tunic, in return for his appeal—we diſtinguiſh, my good father, betwixt thoſe who wiſh only to eat the bread of their own labor —and thoſe who eat the bread of other people's, and have no other plan in life, but to get through it in ſloth and ignorance, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD.</p>
                  <p>The poor Franciſcan made no reply: a hectic of a moment paſſed acroſs his check, but could not tarry— Nature ſeemed to have done with her reſentments in him; he ſhowed none—but letting his ſtaff fall within his arm, he preſſed both his hands with reſignation upon his breaſt, and retired.</p>
                  <p>My heart ſmote me the moment he ſhut the door— Pſhaw! ſaid I with an air of careleſſneſs, three ſeveral

times—But it would not do: every ungracious ſyllable I had uttered, crowded back into my imagination; I reflected I had no right over the poor Franciſcan, but to deny him; and that the puniſhment of that was enough to the diſappointed, without the addition of unkind lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage—I conſidered his gray hairs—his courteous fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure ſeemed to re-enter, and gently aſk me what injury he had done me? and why I could uſe him thus?—I would have given twenty livres for an advocate—I have behaved very ill, ſaid I within myſelf; but I have only juſt ſet out upon my travels, and ſhall learn better manners as I get along.</p>

                     </gap> head-dreſs: within my own memory, I have known it riſe and fall above thirty degrees. About ten years ago it ſhot up to a very great height, inſomuch that the female part of our ſpecies were much taller than the men. The women were of ſuch an enormous ſtature, that 'we appeared as graſshoppers before them.' At preſent the whole ſex is in a manner dwarfed and ſhrunk into a race of beauties that ſeem almoſt another ſpecies. I remember ſeveral ladies who were once very near ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven feet high, that at preſent want ſome inches of five: how they came to be thus curtailed, I cannot learn; whether the whole ſex be at preſent under any penance which we know nothing of, or whether they have caſt their head-dreſſes in order to ſurpriſe us with ſomething in that kind which ſhall be entirely new; or whether ſome of the talleſt of the ſex, being too cunning for the reſt, have contrived this method to make themſelves ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſizeable, is ſtill a ſecret; though I find moſt are of opinion, they are at preſent like trees new lopped and pruned, that will certainly ſprout up and flouriſh with greater heads than before. For my own part, as I do not love to be inſulted by women who are taller than myſelf, I admire the ſex much more in their preſent humiliation, which has reduced them to their natural dimenſions, than when they had extended their perſons and lengthened themſelves out into formidable and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantic figures. I am not for adding to the beautiful
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:021451_0125_0FB3F6BD9D54B290"/>
edifices of nature, nor for raiſing any whimſical ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructure upon her plans: I muſt therefore repeat it, that I am highly pleaſed with the coiffure now in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, and think it ſhows the good ſenſe which at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent very much reigns among the valuable part of the ſex. One may obſerve that women in all ages have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken more pains than men to adorn the outſide of their heads; and indeed I very much admire, that thoſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitects, who raiſe ſuch wonderful ſtructures out of rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, lace, and wire, have not been recorded for their reſpective inventions. It is certain there has been as many orders in theſe kinds of buildings, as in thoſe which have been made of marble; ſometimes they riſe in the ſhape of a pyramid, ſometimes like a tower, and ſometimes like a ſteeple. In Juvenal's time, the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grew by ſeveral orders and ſtories, as he has very humorouſly deſcribed it.
<q>
                        <l>With curls on curls they build her head before,</l>
                        <l>And mount it with a formidable tow'r:</l>
                        <l>A gianteſs ſhe ſeems: but look behind,</l>
                        <l>And then ſhe dwindles to the pigmy kind.</l>
                     </q>
But I do not remember, in any part of my reading, that the head-dreſs aſpired to ſo great an extravagance as in the fourteenth century; when it was built up in a couple of cones or ſpires, which ſtood ſo exceſſively high on each ſide of the head, that a woman, who was but a pigmy without her head-dreſs, appeared like a Coloſſus upon putting it on. Monſier Paradin ſays,
<q>That theſe old faſhioned fontanges roſe an ell above the head: that they were pointed like ſteeples, and had long looſe pieces of crape faſtened to the tops of them, which were curiouſly fringed, and hung down their backs like ſtreamers.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The woman might poſſibly have carried this Gothic building much higher, had not a famous monk, Thomas Connecte by name, attacked it with great zeal and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. This holy man travelled from place to place to preach down this monſtrous commode; and ſucceeded ſo well in it, that, as the magicians ſacrificed their books to the flames upon the preaching of an apoſtle, many of the women threw down their head-dreſſes in the middle of his ſermon, and made a bonfire of them within ſight
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:021451_0126_0FB3F6BF22B17840"/>
of the pulpit. He was ſo renowned, as well for the ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of his life as his manner of preaching, that he had often a congregation of twenty thouſand people; the men placing themſelves on the one ſide of his pulpit, and the women on the other, they appeared, to uſe the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of an ingenious writer, like a foreſt of cedars with their heads reaching to the clouds. He ſo warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and animated the people againſt the monſtrous or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament, that it lay under a kind of perſecution; and whenever it appeared in public, was pelted down by the rabble, who flung ſtones at the perſons who wore it. But, notwithſtanding this prodigy vaniſhed while the preacher was among them, it began to appear again ſome months after his departure, or, to tell it in Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Paradin's own words,
<q>The women, that, like ſnails in a fright, had drawn in their horns, ſhot them out again as ſoon as the danger was over.</q>
This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance of the womens head-dreſſes in that age is taken notice of by Monſieur d'Argentre in the hiſtory of Bretagne, and by other hiſtorians as well as the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I have here quoted.</p>
                  <p>It is uſually obſerved, that a good reign is the only proper time for the making of laws againſt the exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of power; in the ſame manner an exceſſive head-dreſs may be attacked the moſt effectually when the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion is againſt it. I do therefore recommend this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to my female readers by way of prevention.</p>
                  <p>I would deſire the fair ſex to conſider how impoſſible it is for them to add any thing that can be ornamental to what is already the maſter-piece of nature. The head has the moſt beautiful appearance, as well as the higheſt ſtation, in the human figure. Nature has laid out all her art in beautifying the face; ſhe has touched it with vermilion, planted in it a double row of ivory, made it the ſeat of ſmiles and bluſhes, lighted it up and enliven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it with the brightneſs of the eyes, hung it on each ſide with curious organs of ſenſe, given it airs and graces that cannot be deſcribed, and ſurrounded it with ſuch a flowing ſhade of hair, as ſets all its beauties in the moſt agreeable light: in ſhort, ſhe ſeems to have deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the head as the cupola to the moſt glorious of her works; and, when we load it with ſuch a pile of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerary

                  <p>A LEWD young fellow ſeeing an aged hermit go by him barefoot, "Father," ſays he, "you are in a very miſerable condition if there is not another world." "True, ſon," ſaid the hermit; "but what is thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition if there is?"— Man is a creature deſigned for two different ſtates of being, or rather for two different lives. His firſt life is ſhort and tranſient; his ſecond perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and laſting. The queſtion we are all concerned in is this, In which of theſe two lives it is our chief inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt to make ourſelves happy? Or, in other words, Whether we ſhould endeavor to ſecure to ourſelves the pleaſures and gratifications of a life which is uncertain and precarious, and at its utmoſt length of a very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable duration; or to ſecure to ourſelves the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of a life which is fixed and ſettled, and will never end? Every man, upon the firſt hearing of this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, knows very well which ſide of it he ought to cloſe with. But, however right we are in theory, it is plain that in practice we adhere to the wrong ſide of the queſtion. We make proviſion for this life as though it were never to have an end; and for the other life, as though it were never to have a beginning.</p>
                  <p>Should a ſpirit of ſuperior rank, who is a ſtranger to human nature, accidentally alight upon the earth, and take a ſurvey of its inhabitants; what would his notions of us be? Would not he think that we are a ſpecies of beings made for quite different ends and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes than what we really are? Muſt not he imagine that we were placed in this world to get riches and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors? Would not he think that it was our duty to toil after wealth, and ſtation, and title? Nay, would not he believe we were forbidden poverty by threats of eternal puniſhment, and enjoyed to purſue our pleaſures under pain of damnation? He would certainly imagine that we were influenced by a ſcheme of duties quite op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to thoſe which are indeed preſcribed to us. And,
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:021451_0128_0FB3F6C21DEECBC8"/>
truly, according to ſuch an imagination, he muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that we are a ſpecies of the moſt obedient crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the univerſe; that we are conſtant to our duty; and that we keep a ſteady eye on the end for which we were ſent hither.</p>
                  <p>But how great would be his aſtoniſhment, when he learnt that we were beings not deſigned to exiſt in this world above threeſcore and ten years; and that the greateſt part of theſe buſy ſpecies fall ſhort even of that age? How would he be loſt in horror and admiration, when he ſhould know that this ſet of creatures, who lay out all their endeavors for this life, which ſcarce de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the name of exiſtence, when, I ſay, he ſhould know that this ſet of creatures are to exiſt to all eternity in another life, for which they make no preparations? Nothing can be a greater diſgrace to reaſon, than that men, who are perſuaded of theſe two different ſtates of being, ſhould be perpetually employed in providing for a life of threeſcore and ten years, and neglecting to make proviſion for that, which, after many myriads of years, will be ſtill new and ſtill beginning; eſpecially when we conſider that our endeavors for making ourſelves great, or rich, or honorable, or whatever elſe we place our happineſs in, may after all prove unſucceſsful; whereas if we conſtantly and ſincerely endeavor to make our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves happy in the other life, we are ſure that our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors will ſucceed, and that we ſhall not be diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of our hope.</p>
                  <p>The following queſtion is ſtarted by one of the ſchool-men. Suppoſing the whole body of the earth were a great ball or maſs of the fineſt ſand, and that a ſingle grain or particle of this ſand would be annihilated every thouſand years? Suppoſing then that you had it in your choice to be happy all the while this prodigious maſs of ſand was conſuming by this ſlow method until there was not a grain of it left, on condition you were to be miſerable for ever after? or, ſuppoſing that you might be happy for ever after, on condition you would be miſerable until the whole maſs of ſand were thus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilated at the rate of one ſand in a thouſand years; which of theſe two caſes would you make your choice?</p>
                  <p>It muſt be confeſſed, in this caſe, ſo many thouſands
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:021451_0129_0FB3F6C39CA7AD98"/>
of years are to the imagination as a kind of eternity, though in reality they do not bear ſo great a proportion to that duration which is to follow them, as an unit does to the greateſt number which you can put together in figures, or as one of thoſe ſands to the ſuppoſed heap. Reaſon therefore tells us, without any manner of heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which would be the better part in this choice. However, as I have before intimated, our reaſon might, in ſuch caſe, be ſo overſet by the imagination, as to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſome perſons to ſink under the conſideration of the great length of the firſt part of this duration, and of the great diſtance of that ſecond duration which is to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed it; the mind, I ſay, might give itſelf up to that happineſs which is at hand, conſidering that it is ſo very near, and that it would laſt ſo very long. But when the choice we actually have before us is this, Whether we will chooſe to be happy for the ſpace of only three-ſcore and ten, nay perhaps of only twenty or ten years, I might ſay of only a day or an hour, and miſerable to all eternity; or, on the contrary, miſerable for this ſhort term of years, and happy for a whole eternity; what words are ſufficient to expreſs that folly and want of conſideration which in ſuch a caſe makes a wrong choice!</p>
                  <p>I here put the caſe even at the worſt, by ſuppoſing what ſeldom happens, that a courſe of virtue makes us miſerable in this life: but if we ſuppoſe, as it generally happens, that virtue would make us more happy even in this life than a contrary courſe of vice; how can we ſufficiently admire the ſtupidity or madneſs of thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who are capable of making ſo abſurd a choice?</p>
                  <p>Every wiſe man therefore will conſider this life only as it may conduce to the happineſs of the other, and cheerfully ſacrifice the pleaſures of a few years to thoſe of an eternity.</p>

                  <p>EDWARD III. after the battle of Creſſy, laid ſiege to Calais. He had fortified his camp in ſo impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a manner, that all the efforts of France proved ineffectual to raiſe the ſiege, or throw ſuccours into the city.—The citizens, under Count Vienne, their gallant governor, made an admirable defence.—France had now

put the ſickle into her ſecond harveſt, ſince Edward, with his victorious army, ſat down before the town. The eyes of all Europe were intent on the iſſue. At length, famine did more for Edward than arms.—Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuffering unheard-of calamities, they reſolved to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the enemy's camp.—They boldly ſallied forth: The Engliſh joined battle; and, after a long and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate engagement, Count Vienne was taken priſoner, and the citizens who ſurvived the ſlaughter retired with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their gates. The command devolving upon Euſtace St Pierre, a man of mean birth but of exalted virtue, he offered to capitulate with Edward, provided he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them to depart with life and liberty. Edward, to avoid the imputation of cruelty, conſented to ſpare the bulk of the plebeians, provided they delivered up to him ſix of their principal citizens with halters about their necks, as victims of due atonement for that ſpirit of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion with which they had inflamed the vulgar. When his meſſenger, Sir Walter Mauny, delivered the terms, conſternation and pale diſmay were impreſſed on every countenance.—To a long and dead ſilence deep ſighs and groans ſucceeded, till Euſtace St Pierre getting up to a little eminence, thus addreſſed the aſſembly:— "My friends, we are brought to great ſtraits this day. We muſt either yield to the terms of our cruel and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnaring conqueror, or yield up our tender infants, our wives, and daughters, to the bloody and brutal luſts of the violating ſoldiers. Is there any expedient left, whereby we may avoid the guilt and infamy of deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up thoſe (who have ſuffered every miſery with you) on the one hand, or the deſolation and horror of a ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed city on the other? There is, my friends, there is one expedient left, a gracious, an excellent, a godlike expedient! Is there any here to whom virtue is dearer than life? Let him offer himſelf an oblation for the ſafety of his people!

He ſpoke;—but an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal ſilence enſued.—Each man looked around for the example of that virtue and magnanimity which all wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to approve in themſelves, though they wanted the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. At length St Pierre reſumed, "I doubt not

but there are many here as ready, nay, more zealous, of his martyrdom than I can be; though the ſtation to which I am raiſed, by the captivity of Lord Vienne, imparts a right to be the firſt in giving my life for your ſakes. I give it freely; I give it cheerfully. Who comes next?" "Your ſon," exclaimed a youth not yet come to maturity.—"Ah, my child!" cried St Pierre; "I am then twice ſacrificed.—But, no: I have rather begotten thee a ſecond time. Thy years are few, but full, my ſon. The victim of virtue has reached the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt purpoſe and goal of mortality. Who next, my friends? This is the hour of heroes." "Your kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man." cried John de Aire. "Your kinſman," cried James Wiſſant. "Your kinſman," cried Peter Wiſſant. —Ah!" exclaimed Sir Walter Mauny, burſting into tears, "why was not I a citizen of Calais!" The ſixth victim was ſtill wanting, but was quickly ſupplied by lot from numbers who were now emulous of ſo enno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling an example. The keys of the city were then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to Sir Walter. He took the ſix priſoners into his cuſtody; then ordered the gates to be opened, and gave charge to his attendants to conduct the remaining citizens, with their families, through the camp of the Engliſh. Before they departed, however, they deſired permiſſion to take their laſt adieu of their deliverers. What a parting! what a ſcene! They crowded, with their wives and children, about St Pierre and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-priſoners. They embraced; they clung around; they fell proſtrate before them. They groaned; they wept aloud; and the joint clamor of their mourning paſſed the gates of the city, and was heard throughout the Engliſh camp. The Engliſh, by this time, were appriſed of what paſſed within Calais. They heard the voice of lamentation, and their ſouls were touched with compaſſion. Each of the ſoldiers prepared a portion of his own victuals to welcome and entertain the half-famiſhed inhabitants; and they loaded them with as much as their preſent weakneſs was able to bear, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſupply them with ſuſtenance by the way. At length St Pierre and his fellow-victims appeared under the conduct of Sir Walter and a guard. All the tents of the Engliſh were inſtantly emptied The ſoldiers
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:021451_0132_0FB3F6C81E1AE8C0"/>
poured from all parts, and arranged themſelves on each ſide, to behold, to contemplate, to admire, this little band of patriots as they paſſed. They bowed down to them on all ſides. They murmured their applauſe of that virtue, which they could not but revere even in enemies; and they regarded thoſe ropes which they had volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily aſſumed about their necks, as enſigns of greater dignity than that of the Britiſh garter. As ſoon as they had reached the preſence, "Mauny," ſays the monarch, "are theſe the principal inhabitants of Calais?"— "They are," ſays Mauny: "they are not only the principal men of Calais, they are the principal men of France, my Lord, if virtue has any ſhare in the act of ennobling." "Were they delivered peaceably?" ſays Edward, "Was there no reſiſtance, no commotion among the people?" "Not in the leaſt, my Lord; the people would all have periſhed, rather than have deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the leaſt of theſe to your Majeſty. They are ſelf-delivered, ſelf-devoted, and come to offer up their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable heads as an ample equivalent for the ranſom of thouſands." Edward was ſecretly piqued at this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of Sir Walter; but he knew the privilege of a Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh ſubject, and ſuppreſſed his reſentment. "Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience," ſays he, "has ever ſhown, that lenity only ſerves to invite people to new crimes. Severity, at times, is indiſpenſibly neceſſary to compel ſubjects to ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by puniſhment and example. Go," he cried to an officer, "lead theſe men to execution. Your rebellion," continued he addreſſing himſelf to St. Pierre, "your rebellion againſt me, the natural heir of your crown, is highly aggravated by your preſent preſumption and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front of my power."—"We have nothing to aſk of your Majeſty," ſaid Euſtace, "ſave what you cannot refuſe us."—"What is that?" "Your eſteem, my Lord," ſaid Euſtace; and went out with his companions.</p>
                  <p>At this inſtant a ſound of triumph was head through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the camp. The Queen had juſt arrived with a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful reinforcement of gallant troops. Sir Walter Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny flew to receive her Majeſty, and briefly informed her of the particulars reſpecting the ſix victims.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as ſhe had been welcomed by Edward and his court, ſhe deſired a private audience. "My Lord,"
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:021451_0133_0FB3F6C9A574B6F0"/>
ſaid ſhe, "the queſtion I am to enter upon, is not touching the lives of a few mechanics— it reſpects the honor of the Engliſh nation; it reſpects the glory of my Edward, my huſband, my king.—You think you have ſentenced ſix of your enemies to death. No, my Lord, they have ſentenced themſelves; and their execution would be the execution of their own orders, not the orders of Edward.</p>
                  <p>"They have behaved themſelves worthily; they have behaved themſelves greatly: and I cannot but reſpect, while I envy them, for leaving us no ſhare in the honor of this action, ſave that of granting a poor, an indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible pardon. I admit they have deſerved every thing that is evil at your hands. They have proved the moſt inveterate and obſtinate of your enemies. They a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone have withſtood the rapid courſe of your conqueſts, and have with-held from you the crown to which you were born. Is it therefore that you would reward them? that you would gratify their deſires, that you would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge their ambition, and enwreath them with everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glory and applauſe? But if ſuch a death would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt mechanics over the fame of the moſt illuſtrious heroes, how would the name of Edward, with all his triumphs, be tarniſhed thereby? Would it not be ſaid, that mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity and virtue are grown odious in the eyes of the monarch of Britain? and that the objects whom he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines to the puniſhment of felons, are the very men who deſerve the praiſe and eſteem of mankind? The ſtage on which they would ſuffer, would be to them a ſtage of honor, but a ſtage of ſhame to Edward; a reproach to his conqueſts; an indelible diſgrace to his name.— No, my Lord, let us rather diſappoint theſe haughty burghers, who wiſh to inveſt themſelves with glory at our expence. We cannot wholly deprive them of the merit of a ſacrifice ſo nobly intended, but we may cut them ſhort of their deſires; in the place of that death by which their glory would be conſummate, let us bury them under gifts; let us put them to confuſion with applauſes. We ſhall thereby defeat them of that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular opinion, which never fails to attend thoſe who ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in the cauſe of virtue." "I am convinced; you have prevailed. Be it ſo," replied Edward: "Prevent
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:021451_0134_0FB3F6CB1E26CBB8"/>
the execution; have them inſtantly before us."—They came; when the Queen, with an aſpect and accents diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing ſweetneſs, thus beſpoke them: "Natives of France and inhabitants of Calais, ye have put us to a vaſt expence of blood and treaſure in the recovery of our juſt and natural inheritance: but you have acted up to the beſt of an erroneous judgment; and we admire and honor in you that valor and virtue, by which we are ſo long kept out of our rightful poſſeſſions. You noble burghers! you excellent citizens! though you were tenfold the enemies of our perſon and our throne, we can feel nothing on our part, ſave reſpect and affection for you. You have been ſufficiently teſted. We looſe your chains; we ſnatch you from the ſcaffold; and we thank you for that leſſon of humiliation which you teach us, when you ſhow us, that excellence is not of blood, of title, or ſtation;—that virtue gives a dignity ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to that of kings; and that thoſe whom the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty informs with ſentiments like yours, are juſtly and eminently raiſed above all human diſtinctions. You are now free to depart to your kinsfolk, your country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to all thoſe whoſe lives and liberties you have ſo nobly redeemed, provided you refuſe not the tokens of our eſteem. Yet we would rather bind you to ourſelves, by every endearing obligation; and for this purpoſe, we offer to you your choice of the gifts and honors that Edward has to beſtow.—Rivals for fame, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways friends to virtue, we wiſh that England were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to call you her ſons." "Ah, my country!" ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed Pierre; "it is now that I tremble for you; Edward only wins our cities, but Philippa conquers hearts."</p>

                  <head>I. ON GRACE IN WRITING.</head>
                  <p>I Will not undertake to mark out with any ſort of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, that idea which I would expreſs by the word Grace: and, perhaps, it can no more be clearly deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed than juſtly defined. To give you, however, a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral intimation of what I mean when I apply that term to compoſitions of genius, I would reſemble it to that eaſy air which ſo remarkably diſtinguiſhes certain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of a genteel and liberal caſt. It conſiſts not only in the particular beauty of ſingle parts, but ariſes from the general ſymmetry and conſtruction of the whole. An author may be juſt in his ſentiments, lively in his figures, and clear in his expreſſion; yet may have no claim to be admitted in the rank of finiſhed writers. The ſeveral members muſt be ſo agreeably united, as mutually to reflect beauty upon each other; their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement muſt be ſo happily diſpoſed as not to admit of the leaſt tranſpoſition, without manifeſt prejudice to the entire piece. The thoughts, the metaphors, the alluſions, and the diction, ſhould appear eaſy and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and ſeem to ariſe like ſo many ſpontaneous produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, rather than as the effects of art or labor.</p>
                  <p>Whatever, therefore, is forced or affected in the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents; whatever is pompous or pedantic in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, is the very reverſe of Grace. Her mien is neither that of a prude nor a coquette; ſhe is regular without formality, and ſprightly without being fantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. Grace, in ſhort, is to good writing what a proper light is to a fine picture; it not only ſhows all the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures in their ſeveral proportions and relations, but ſhows them in the moſt advantageous manner.</p>
                  <p>As gentility (to reſume my former illuſtration) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the minuteſt action, and improves the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable geſture; ſo grace is diſcovered in the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing even a ſingle word, or the turn of a mere expletive. Neither is this inexpreſſible quality confined to one ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:021451_0136_0FB3F6CE23727680"/>
of compoſition only, but extends to all the various kinds; to the humble paſtoral as well as to the lofty e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pic; from the ſlighteſt letter to the moſt ſolemn diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
                  <p>I know not whether Sir William Temple may not be conſidered as the firſt of our proſe authors, who intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a graceful manner into our language. At leaſt that quality does not ſeem to have appeared early, or ſpread far, amongſt us. But whereſoever we may look for its origin, it is certainly to be found in its higheſt perfection in the eſſays of a gentleman whoſe writings will be diſtinguiſhed ſo long as politeneſs and good ſenſe have any admirers. That becoming air which Tully eſteemed the criterion of fine compoſition, and which every reader, he ſays, imagines ſo eaſy to be imitated, yet will find ſo difficult to attain, is the prevailing cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtic of all that excellent author's moſt elegant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances. In a word, one may juſtly apply to him what Plato, in his allegorical language, ſays of Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes; that the Graces, having ſearched all the world round for a temple wherein they might for ever dwell, ſettled at laſt in the breaſt of Mr Addiſon.</p>

                  <head>II. ON FEMALE ORATORY.</head>
                  <p>WE are told by ſome ancient authors, that Socrates was inſtructed in eloquence by a woman, whoſe name, if I am not miſtaken, was Aſpaſia. I have indeed very often looked upon that art as the moſt proper for the female ſex; and I think the univerſities would do well to conſider whether they ſhould not fill the rhetoric chairs with ſhe-profeſſors.</p>
                  <p>It has been ſaid in the praiſe of ſome men, that they could talk whole hours together upon any thing; but it muſt be owned to the honor of the other ſex, that there are many among them who can talk whole hours toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon nothing. I have known a woman branch out into a long extempore diſſertation upon the edging of a petticoat, and chide her ſervant for breaking a china-cup, in all the figures of rhetoric.</p>
                  <p>Were woman admitted to plead in courts of judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I am perſuaded they would carry the eloquence of the bar to greater heights than it has yet arrived at. If
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:021451_0137_0FB3F6CF9ED9C038"/>
any one doubts this, let him but be preſent at thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates which frequently ariſe among the ladies of the Britiſh fiſhery.</p>
                  <p>The firſt kind, therefore, of female orators which I ſhall take notice of, are thoſe who are employed in ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up the paſſions; a part of rhetoric in which Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes's wife had perhaps made a greater proficiency than his above-mentioned teacher.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond kind of female orators, are thoſe who deal in invectives and who are commonly known by the name of the cenſorious. The imagination and elocution of this ſet of rhetoricians is wonderful. With what a fluency of invention, and copiouſneſs of expreſſion, will they enlarge upon every little ſlip in the behavior of another? With how many different circumſtances, and with what variety of phraſes, they will tell over the ſame ſtory? I have known an old lady make an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy marriage the ſubject of a month's converſation. She blamed the bride in one place, pitied her in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, laughed at her in a third, wondered at her in the fourth, was angry at her in a fifth; and in ſhort, wore out a pair of coach-horſes in expreſſing her concern for her. At length, after having quite exhauſted the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject on this ſide, ſhe made a viſit to the new-married pair, praiſed the wife for the prudent choice ſhe had made, told her the unreaſonable reflections which ſome malicious people had caſt upon her, and deſired that they might be better acquainted. The cenſure and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of this kind of women are therefore only to be conſidered as helps to diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>A third kind of female orators may be comprehended under the word Goſſips. Mrs. Fiddle-Faddle is perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accompliſhed in this ſort of eloquence; ſhe launches out into deſcriptions of chriſtenings, runs diviſions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an head-dreſs, knows every diſh of meat that is ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in her neighborhood, and entertains her company a whole afternoon together with the wit of her little boy, before he is able to ſpeak.</p>
                  <p>The coquette may be looked upon as a fourth kind of female orator. To give herſelf the larger field for diſcourſe ſhe hates and loves in the ſame breath, talks to her lap-dog or parrot, is uneaſy in all kinds of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:021451_0138_0FB3F6D11C602518"/>
and in every part of the room; ſhe has falſe quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels and feigned obligations to all the men of her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance? ſighs when ſhe is not ſad, and laughs when ſhe is not merry. The coquette is in particular a great miſtreſs of that part of oratory which is called action; and indeed ſeems to ſpeak for no other purpoſe but as it gives her an opportunity of ſtirring a limb or varying a feature, of glancing her eyes or playing with her fan.</p>
                  <p>As for newſmongers, politicians, mimics, ſtory-tellers, with other characters of that nature which give birth to loquacity, they are as commonly found among the men as the women; for which reaſon I ſhall paſs them over in ſilence.</p>
                  <p>I have often been puzzled to aſſign a cauſe why wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſhould have this talent of a ready utterance in ſo much greater perfection than men. I have ſometimes fancied they that have not a retentive power, or the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of ſuppreſſing their thoughts, as men have; but that they are neceſſitated to ſpeak every thing they think; and if ſo, it would perhaps furniſh a very ſtrong argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Carteſians for the ſupporting of their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, that the ſoul always thinks. But as ſeveral are of opinion, that the fair ſex are not altogether ſtrangers to the art of diſſembling and concealing their thoughts, I have been forced to relinquiſh that opinion; and have therefore endeavored, to ſeek after ſome better reaſon. In order to it, a friend of mine, who is an excellent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomiſt, has promiſed me, by the firſt opportunity, to diſſect a woman's tongue, and to examine whether there may not be in it certain juices which render it ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully voluble or flippant; or whether the fibres of it may not be made up of a finer or more pliant thread; or whether there are not in it ſome particular muſcles which dart it up and down by ſuch ſudden glances and vibrations; or whether, in the laſt place, there may not be ſome certain undiſcovered channels running from the head and the heart to this little inſtrument of loquacity, and conveying into it a perpetual affluence of animal ſpirits. Nor muſt I omit the reaſon which Hudibras has given, why thoſe who can talk on trifles ſpeak with the greateſt fluency; namely, that the tongue is like a
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:021451_0139_0FB3F6D29D1E48E0"/>
race-horſe, which runs the faſter the leſs weight it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
                  <p>Which of theſe reaſons ſoever may be looked upon as the moſt probable, I think the Iriſhman's thought was very natural, who, after ſome hours converſation with a female orator, told her, that he believed her tongue was very glad when ſhe was aſleep, for that it had not a moment's reſt all the while ſhe was awake.</p>
                  <p>That excellent old ballad of the Wanton Wife of Bath, has the following remarkable lines:
<q>
                        <l>I think, quoth Thomas, women's tongues</l>
                        <l>Of Aſpen leaves are made.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And Ovid, though in the deſcription of a very barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous circumſtance, tells us, That when the tongue of a beautiful female was cut out, and thrown upon the ground, it could not forbear muttering even in that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>—The blade had cut</l>
                     <l>Her tongue ſheer off, cloſe to the trembling root;</l>
                     <l>The mangled part ſtill quiver'd on the ground,</l>
                     <l>Murmuring with a faint imperfect ſound</l>
                     <l>And as a ſerpent wreaths his wounded train,</l>
                     <l>Uneaſy panting, and poſſeſs'd with pain.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>If a tongue would be talking without a mouth, what could it have done when it had all its organ's of ſpeech, and accomplices of ſound about it? I might here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the ſtory of the pippin-women, had I not ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to look upon it as fabulous.</p>
                  <p>I muſt confeſs I am ſo wonderfully charmed with the muſic of this little inſtrument, that I would by no means diſcourage it. All that I aim at by this diſſertation is, to cure it of ſeveral diſagreeable notes, and in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of thoſe little jarrings and diſſonances which ariſe from anger, cenſoriouſneſs, goſſipping, and coquetry. In ſhort, I would always have it tuned by good nature, truth, diſcretion, and ſincerity.</p>

If he, who ſurveys an academy, a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, or a court of juſtice, and obſerves regularity, order, and oeconomy, prevailing in them, is immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that this regularity, muſt be the effect of authority and diſcipline, ſupported by perſons properly qualified; how much more reaſon has he, who finds himſelf ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by ſo many and ſuch ſtupendous bodies, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming their various revolutions without the leaſt deviation from perfect regularity, through the innumer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ages of paſt duration; how much more reaſon has he to conclude, that ſuch amazing revolutions are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by ſuperior wiſdom and power?</p>
                  <p>Is it not therefore aſtoniſhing, that any man ſhould ever have dreamed of the poſſibility that a beautiful and magnificent ſyſtem might ariſe from the fortuitous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of certain bodies, carried towards one another by I know not what imaginary impulſe? I ſee not why he who is capable of aſcribing the production of a world to a cauſe ſo inadequate, may not expect, from the fortui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous ſcattering about of a ſet of letters of ivory or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, a regular hiſtory to appear. But I believe he who hopes to produce, in this way, one ſingle line, will find himſelf for ever diſappointed. If the caſual concourſe of atoms has produced a whole univerſe, how comes it that we never find a city, a temple, or ſo much as a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tico, produced in the ſame manner?

                  <p>The reaſonings of Ariſtotle on this point are excellent. —"Let us ſuppoſe," ſays he, "certain perſons to have been born, and to have lived to mature age, under ground, in habitations accommodated with all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences and even magnificences of life, except the ſight of this upper world.

the wide extended ocean, the lofty ſky, and the clouds carried along by the winds.

                  <p>Thus Ariſtotle.

                  <p>THE darts of adverſe fortune are always levelled at our heads. Some reach us; ſome graze againſt us, and fly to wound our neighbors. Let us therefore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe an equal temper on our minds, and pay without murmuring the tribute which we owe to humanity. The winter brings cold and we muſt freeze. The ſummer returns with heat, and we muſt melt. The inclemency of the air diſorders our health, and we muſt be ſick. Here we are expoſed to wild beaſts, and there to men more ſavage than the beaſts: and if we eſcape the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences and dangers of the air and the earth, there are perils by water and perils by fire. This eſtabliſhed courſe of things it is not in our power to change: but it is in our power to aſſume ſuch a greatneſs of mind as becomes wiſe and virtuous men, as may enable us to encounter the accidents of life with fortitude, and to conform our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the order of Nature, who govern her great

kingdom the world, by continual mutations. Let us ſubmit to this order; let us be perſuaded that whatever does happen ought to happen, and never be ſo fooliſh as to expoſtulate with Nature. The beſt reſolution we can take is to ſuffer with patience what we cannot alter; and purſue without repining, the road which Providence, who directs every thing, has marked out to us: for it is not enough to follow; and he is but a bad ſoldier who ſighs and marches on with reluctancy. We muſt receive the orders with ſpirit and cheerfulneſs, and not endeavor to ſlink out of the poſt which is aſſigned us in this beautiful diſpoſition of things, whereof even our ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering make a neceſſary part. Let us addreſs ourſelves to God, who governs all, as Cleanthes did in thoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable verſes, which are going to loſe part of their grace and energy in my tranſlation of them.

                        <l>Fate leads the willing, drags the backward on.</l>
                        <l>Why ſhould I grieve, when grieving I muſt bear?</l>

Thus let us ſpeak, and thus let us act. Reſignation to the will of God is true magnanimity. But the ſure mark of a puſillanimous and baſe ſpirit, is to ſtruggle againſt, to cenſure, the order of Providence, and, inſtead of mending our own conduct, to ſet up for correcting that of our Maker.</p>

                  <head>V. ADVANTAGES of HISTORY.</head>
                  <p>THE advantages found in hiſtory ſeem to be of three kinds: as it amuſes the fancy, as it improves the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and as it ſtrengthens virtue.</p>
                  <p>In reality, what more agreeable entertainment to the mind than to be tranſported into the remoteſt ages of the world, and to obſerve human ſociety, in its infancy, making the firſt faint eſſays towards the arts and ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? To ſee the policy of government and the civility of converſation refining by degrees, and every thing that is ornamental to human life advancing towards its perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? To mark the riſe, progreſs, and declenſion, and final extinction of the moſt flouriſhing empires; the virtues which contributed to their greatneſs, and the vices which drew
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:021451_0143_0FB3F6D89ECA2808"/>
on their ruin? In ſhort, to ſee all the human race, from the beginning of time, paſs as it were in review before us, appearing in their true colors, without any of thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſes, which, during their lifetime, ſo much perplexed the judgments of the beholders? What ſpectacle can be imagined ſo magnificent, ſo various, ſo intereſting? What amuſement, either of the ſenſes or imagination, can be compared with it? Shall thoſe trifling paſtimes, which engroſs ſo much of our time, be preferred as more ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory, and more fit to engage our attention? How perverſe muſt that taſte be which is capable of ſo wrong a choice of pleaſures?</p>
                  <p>But hiſtory is a moſt improving part of knowledge, as well as an agreeable amuſement; and indeed a great part of what we commonly call erudition, and value ſo highly, is nothing but an acquaintance with hiſtorical facts. An extenſive knowledge of this kind belongs to men of letters; but I muſt think it an unpardonable ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance in perſons, of whatever ſex or condition, not to be acquainted with the hiſtory of their own country a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with the hiſtories of ancient Greece and Rome.</p>
                  <p>I muſt add, that hiſtory is not only a valuable part of knowledge, but opens the door to many other parts of knowledge, and affords materials to moſt of the ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And indeed, if we conſider the ſhortneſs of human life, and our limited knowledge, even of what paſſes in our own time, we muſt be ſenſible that we ſhould be for ever children in underſtanding, were it not for this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, which ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ends our experience to all paſt ages, and to the moſt diſtant nations: making them contribute as much to our improvement in wiſdom, as if they had actually lain under our obſervation. A man acquainted with hiſtory may, in ſome reſpect, be ſaid to have lived from the beginning of the world, and to have been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king continual additions to his ſtock of knowledge in every century.</p>
                  <p>There is alſo an advantage in that knowledge which is acquired by hiſtory, above what is learned by the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the world, that it brings us acquainted with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man affairs, without diminiſhing in the leaſt from the moſt delicate ſentiments of virtue. And, to tell the truth, I ſcarce know any ſtudy or occupation ſo unexcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:021451_0144_0FB3F6DA96F7A380"/>
as hiſtory in this particular. Poets can paint virtue in the moſt charming colors? but, as they addreſs themſelves entirely to the paſſions, they often become advocates for vice. Even philoſophers are apt to bewil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der themſelves in the ſubtilty of their ſpeculations; and we have ſeen ſome go ſo far as to deny the reality of all moral diſtinctions. But I think it a remark worthy the attention of the ſpeculative reader, that the hiſtorians have been, almoſt without exception, the true friends of virtue, and have always repreſented it in its proper co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, however they may have erred in their judgments of particular perſons. Nor is this combination of hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians in favor of virtue at all difficult to be accounted for. When a man of buſineſs enters into life and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he is more apt to conſider the characters of men as they have relation to his intereſt than as they ſtand in themſelves, and has his judgment warped on every oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion by the violence of his paſſion. When a philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher contemplates characters and manners in his cloſet, the general abſtract view of the objects leaves the mind ſo cold and unmoved, that the ſentiments of nature have no room to play, and he ſcarce feels the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt vice and virtue. Hiſtory keeps in a juſt medium betwixt theſe extremes, and places the objects in their true point of view. The writers of hiſtory, as well as the readers, are ſufficiently intereſted in the characters and events, to have a lively ſentiment of blame or praiſe; and, at the ſame time, have no particular intereſt or concern to pervert their judgment.</p>

                  <head>VI. BATTLE of PHARSALIA and DEATH of POMPEY.</head>
                  <p>CAESAR had employed all his art for ſome time in ſounding the inclinations of his men; and finding his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my once more reſolute and vigorous, he cauſed them to advance towards the plains of Pharſalia, where Pompey was now encamped, and prepared to oppoſe him.</p>
                  <p>The approach of theſe two great armies, compoſed of the beſt and braveſt troops in the world, together with the greatneſs of the prize for which they contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, filled all minds with anxiety, though with different expectations. Pompey's army, being moſt numerous, turned all their thoughts to the enjoyment of the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory;
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:021451_0145_0FB3F6DB9D059890"/>
Caeſar's, with better aims, conſidered only the means of obtaining it: Pompey's army depended upon their numbers and their many generals; Caeſar's, upon their own diſcipline, and the conduct of their ſingle commander: Pompey's partizans hoped much from the juſtice of their cauſe; Caeſar's alleging the frequent propoſals which they had made for peace without effect. Thus, the views, hopes, and motives of both ſeemed different, but their hatred and ambition were the ſame. Caeſar, who was ever foremoſt in offering battle, led out his army in array to meet the enemy; but Pompey, either ſuſpecting his troops, or dreading the event, kept his advantageous ſituation for ſome time: he drew in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſometimes out of his camp, but always kept him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under his trenches, at the foot of the hill near which he was poſted. Caeſar, being unwilling to attack him at a diſadvantage, reſolved to decamp the next day, hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to haraſs out his antagoniſh, who was not a match for him in ſuſtaining the fatigues of duty. According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the order for marching was given, and the tents ſtruck, when word was brought him that Pompey's ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my had quitted their entrenchments, and had advanced farther into the plain than uſual, ſo that he might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage them at leſs diſadvantage: whereupon he cauſed his troops that were upon their march to halt, and with a countenance of joy, informed them, that the happy time was at laſt come which they had ſo long wiſhed for, and which was to crown their glory and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate their fatigues. Upon this he drew up his troops in order, and advanced towards the place of battle. His forces did not amount to above half thoſe of Pompey; the army of the one amounting to above forty-five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand foot and ſeven thouſand horſe; that of the other not exceeding twenty-two thouſand foot and about a thouſand horſe. This diſproportion, particularly in the cavalry, had filled Caeſar with apprehenſions: wherefore he had ſome days before picked out the ſtrongeſt and nimbleſt of his foot ſoldiers, and accuſtomed them to fight between the ranks of his cavalry. By their aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance his thouſand horſe was a match for Pompey's ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thouſand, and had actually got the better in a ſkir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh that happened between them ſome days before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="147" facs="unknown:021451_0146_0FB3F6DD240E9358"/>Pompey, on the other hand, had ſtrong expectations of ſucceſs: he boaſted that he could put Caeſar's legions to flight without ſtriking a ſingle blow; preſuming, that, as ſoon as the armies formed, his cavalry, on which he placed his greateſt expectations, would outflank and ſurround the enemy. Labienus commended this ſcheme of Pompey; alleging alſo that the preſent troops of which Caeſar's army was compoſed, were but the ſhadow of thoſe old legions that had fought in Britain and Gaul; that all the veterans were worn out, and had been replaced by new levies made in a hurry in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalpine Gaul. To increaſe the confidence of the army ſtill more, he took an oath, which the reſt of the officers followed him in, never to return to the camp but with victory. In this diſpoſition, and under theſe advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous circumſtances, Pompey led his troops to battle.</p>
                  <p>Pompey's order of battle was good and well judged. In the centre, and on the two flanks, he placed all his veterans, and diſtributed his new-raiſed troops between the wings and the main body. The Syrian legions were placed in the centre, under the command of Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio; the Spaniards, on whom he greatly relied, were put on the right under Domitius Aenobarbus; and on the left were ſtationed the two legions which Caeſar had reſtored in the beginning of the war, led on by Pompey himſelf; becauſe from thence he intended to make the attack which was to gain the day; and, for the ſame reaſon, he had there aſſembled all his horſe, ſlingers, and archers, of which his right wing had no need, being co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the river Enipius. Caeſar likewiſe divided his army into three bodies, under three commanders; Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitius Calvinus being placed in the centre, and Mark Anthony on the left, while he himſelf led on the right wing, which was to oppoſe the left commanded by Pompey. It is remarkable enough that Pompey choſe to put himſelf at the head of thoſe troops which were diſciplined and inſtructed by Caeſar; an inconteſtible proof how much he valued them above any of the reſt of his army. Caeſar, on the contrary, placed himſelf at the head of his tenth legion, that had owed all its merit and fame to his own training. As he obſerved the enemy's numerous cavalry to be all drawn to one ſpot,
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:021451_0147_0FB3F6DE9CB68660"/>
he gueſſed at Pompey's intention; to obviate which he made a draught of ſix cohorts from his rear line, and forming them into a ſeparate body, concealed them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind his right wing, with inſtructions not to throw their javelins on the approach of Pompey's horſe, as was cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomary, but to keep them in their hands and puſh them directly in the faces and the eyes of the horſemen, who, being compoſed of the younger part of the Roman nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, valued themſelves much upon their beauty, and dreaded a ſcar in the face more than a wound in the body. He laſtly placed the little cavalry he had, ſo as to cover the right of the tenth legion, ordering his third line not to march till they had received the ſignal from himſelf.</p>
                  <p>As the armies approached, the two generals went from rank to rank, encouraging their men, warming their hopes, and leſſening their apprehenſions. Pompey repreſented to his men, that the glorious occaſion which they had long beſought him to grant was now before them; "and indeed," cried he, "what advantages could you wiſh over an enemy, that you are not now poſſeſſed of? Your numbers, your vigor, a late victory, all aſſure a ſpeedy and an eaſy conqueſt of thoſe haraſſed and broken troops, compoſed of men worn out with age, and impreſſed with the terrors of a recent defeat: but there is ſtill a ſtronger bulwark for our protection than the ſuperiority of our ſtrength—the juſtice of our cauſe. You are engaged in the defence of liberty and of your country; you are ſupported by its laws, and followed by its magiſtrates; you have the world ſpectators of your conduct, and wiſhing you ſucceſs; on the contrary, he whom you oppoſe is a robber and oppreſſor of his country, and almoſt already ſunk with the conſciouſneſs of his crimes, as well as the bad ſucceſs of his arms. Show, then, on this occaſion, all that ardor and deteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of tyranny that ſhould animate Romans, and do juſtice to mankind." Caeſar, on his ſide, went among his men with that ſteady ſerenity for which he was ſo much admired in the midſt of danger. He inſiſted on nothing ſo ſtrongly to his ſoldiers as his frequent and unſucceſsful endeavors for peace. He talked with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of the blood he was going to ſhed, and pleaded
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:021451_0148_0FB3F6E097608710"/>
only the neceſſity that urged him to it. He deplored the many brave men that were to fall on both ſides, and the wounds of his country whoever ſhould be victorious. His ſoldiers anſwered his ſpeech with looks of ardor and impatience; which obſerving, he gave the ſignal to begin. The word on Pompey's ſide, was Hercules the invincible: that on Caeſar's, Venus the victorious. There was only ſo much ſpace between both armies as to give room for fighting; wherefore Pompey ordered his men to receive the firſt ſhock without moving out of their places, expecting the enemy's ranks to be put into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order by their motion. Caeſar's ſoldiers were now ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on with their uſual impetuoſity, when perceiving the enemy motionleſs, they all ſtopt ſhort as if by general conſent, and halted in the midſt of their career. A ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible pauſe enſued, in which both armies continued to gaze upon each other with mutual terror and dreadful ſerenity; at length, Caeſar's men, having taken breath, ran furiouſly upon the enemy, firſt diſcharging their ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velins, and then drawing their ſwords. The ſame me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod was obſerved by Pompey's troops, who as vigorouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſed the attack. His cavalry alſo were ordered to charge at the very onſet, which, with the multitude of archers and ſlingers, ſoon obliged Caeſar's men to give ground; whereupon Caeſar immediately ordered the ſix cohorts that were placed as a reinforcement to advance, with orders to ſtrike at the enemy's faces. This had its deſired effect. The cavalry, that were but juſt now ſure of victory, received an immediate check: the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual method of fighting purſued by the cohorts, their aiming entirely at the viſages of the aſſailants, and the horrible disfiguring wounds they made, all contributed to intimidate them ſo much, that, inſtead of defending their perſons, their only endeavor was to ſave their faces. A total rout enſued of their whole body, which fled in great diſorder to the neighboring mountains, while the archers and ſlingers, who were thus abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, were cut to pieces. Caeſar now commanded the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts to purſue their ſucceſs, and, advancing, charged Pompey's troops upon the flank. This charge the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my withſtood for ſome time with great bravery, till he brought up his third line, which had not yet engaged

Pompey's infantry being thus doubly attacked in front by freſh troops, and in rear by the victorious cohorts. could no longer reſiſt, but fled to their camp. The flight began among the ſtrangers, though Pompey's right wing ſtill valiantly maintained their ground. Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar, however, being convinced that the victory was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, with his uſual clemency cried out, to purſue the ſtrangers, but to ſpare the Romans; upon which they all laid down their arms and received quarters. The greateſt ſlaughter was among the auxiliaries, who fled on all quarters, but principally went for ſafety to the camp. The battle ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ow laſted from the break of day till noon, although the weather was extremely hot; the conquerors, however, did not remit their ardor, being encouraged by the example of their general, who thought his victory not complete till he became maſter of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's camp. Accordingly, marching on foot at their head, he called upon them to follow and ſtrike the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive blow. The cohorts which were left to defend the camp, for ſome time made a formidable reſiſtance, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly a great number of Thracians and other barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians who were appointed for its defence: but nothing could reſiſt the ardor of Caeſar's victorious army; they were at laſt driven from their trenches, and all fled to the mountains not far off. Caeſar ſeeing the field and camp ſtrewed with his fallen countrymen, was ſtrongly affected at ſo melancholy a proſpect, and could not help crying out to one that ſtood near him, "They would have it ſo." Upon entering the enemy's camp, every object preſented freſh inſtances of the blind preſumption and madneſs of his adverſaries. On all ſides were to be ſeen tents adorned with ivy, and branches of myrtle, couches covered with purple, and ſideboards loaded with plate. Every thing gave proofs of the higheſt luxury, and ſeemed rather the preparatives for a banquet, the rejoicings for a victory, than the diſpoſitions for a battle. A camp ſo richly furniſhed might have been able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the attention of any troops but Caeſar's; there was ſtill ſomething to be done, and he would not permit them to purſue any other object than their enemies, till they were entirely ſubdued. A conſiderable body of them having retired to the adjacent mountains, he prevailed
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:021451_0150_0FB3F6E31D18D658"/>
on his ſoldiers to join him in the purſuit, in order to oblige theſe to ſurrender. He began by incloſing them with a line drawn at the foot of the mountain; but they quickly abandoned a poſt which was not tenable for want of water, and endeavored to reach the city of Lariſſa. Caeſar led a party of his army by a ſhorter way, and intercepted their retreat, drawing up in order of battle between them and the city. However, theſe unhappy fugitives once more found protection from a mountain, at the foot of which a rivulet ran, which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied them with water. Now night approaching, Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar's men were almoſt ſpent, and ready to faint with their inceſſant toil ſince morning; yet ſtill he prevailed upon them once more to renew their labors, and to cut off the rivulet that ſupplied the defendents. The fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitives, thus deprived of all hopes of ſuccor or ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſent deputies to the conqueror, offering to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render at diſcretion. During the interval of negocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a few ſenators that were among them took the advantage of the night to eſcape, and the reſt next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gave up their arms, and experienced the conqueror's clemency. In fact, he addreſſed them with great gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and forbade his ſoldiers to offer them any violence, or take any thing from them. Thus Caeſar, by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, gained the moſt complete victory that had ever been obtained; and, by his great clemency after the battle, ſeemed to have deſerved it. His loſs amounted to but two hundered men; that of Pompey to fifteen thouſand, as well Romans as auxiliaries: twenty-four thouſand men ſurrendered themſelves priſoners of war, the greateſt part of whom entered into Caeſar's a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

As to the ſenators and Roman knights who fell into his hands, he generouſly gave liberty to retire where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they thought proper; and as for the letters which Pompey had received from ſeveral perſons who wiſhed to be thought neutral, he burnt them all without read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them as Pompey had done upon a former occaſion. Thus, having performed all the duties of a general and a ſtateſman, he ſent for the legions which had paſſed the night in the camp, to relieve thoſe which had accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied

                  <p>As for Pompey, who had formerly ſhown ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of courage and conduct, when he ſaw his cavalry routed, on which he had placed his ſole dependance, he abſolutely loſt his reaſon. Inſtead of thinking how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy this diſorder, by rallying ſuch troops as fled, or by oppoſing freſh troops to ſtop the progreſs of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors, being totally amazed by this unexpected blow, he returned to the camp, and, in his tent, waited the iſſue of an event, which it was his duty to direct, not to follow. There he remained for ſome moments without ſpeaking; till, being told that the camp was attacked, "What," ſays he, "are we purſued to our very entrenchments?" and immediately quitting his armor for a habit more ſuitable to his circumſtances, he fled on horſeback to Lariſſa; from whence, perceiving he was not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, he ſlackened his pace, giving way to all the ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing reflections which his deplorable ſituation muſt naturally ſuggeſt. In this melancholy manner he paſſed along the vale of Tempe, and, purſuing the courſe of the river Peneus, at laſt arrived at a fiſherman's hut, in which he paſſed the night. From thence he went on board a little bark, and, keeping along the ſea-ſhore, he deſcried a ſhip of ſome burden, which ſeemed preparing to ſail, in which he embarked, the maſter of the veſſel ſtill pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him the homage which was due to his former ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. From the mouth of the river Peneus he ſailed to Amphipolis; where, finding his affairs deſperate, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

She, who had long flattered herſelf with the hopes of victory, felt the reverſe of her fortune in an agony of diſtreſs. She was deſired by the meſſenger (whoſe tears more than words proclaimed the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her misfortunes) to haſten if ſhe expected to ſee Pompey, with but one ſhip, and even that not his own. Her grief, which before was violent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came then inſupportable; ſhe fainted away, and lay a conſiderable time without any ſigns of life. At length recovering herſelf, and reflecting it was now no time for vain lamentations, ſhe ran quite through the city to

the ſea-ſide. Pompey embraced her without ſpeaking a word, and for ſome time ſupported her in his arms in ſilent deſpair.</p>
                  <p>Having taken in Cornelia, he now continued his courſe, ſteering to the ſouth-eaſt, and ſtopping no longer than was neceſſary to take in proviſions at the ports that occurred in his paſſage. He was at laſt prevailed upon to apply to Ptolemy king of Egypt, to whoſe father Pompey had been a conſiderable benefactor. Ptolemy, who was as yet a minor, had not the government in his own hands, but he and his kingdom were under the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Photinus an eunuch, and Theodotus a maſter of the art of ſpeaking. Theſe adviſed that Pompey ſhould be invited on ſhore, and there ſlain; and, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, Achillas, the commander of the forces, and Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timius, by birth a Roman, and who had formerly been a centurion in Pompey's army, were appointed to carry their opinion into execution. Being attended by three or four more, they went into a little bark, and rowed off from land towards Pompey's ſhip that lay about a mile from the ſhore. Pompey, after taking leave of Cornelia, who wept at his departure, and having repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two verſes of Sophocles, ſignifying, that he who truſts his freedom to a tyrant from that moment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a ſlave, gave his hand to Achillas, and ſtept into the bark, with only two attendants of his own. They had now rowed from the ſhip a good way, and, as during that time they all kept a profound ſilence, Pompey, willing to begin the diſcourſe, accoſted Septimius, whoſe face he recollected. "Methinks, friend," cried he, "you and I were once fellow-ſoldiers together." Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timius gave only a nod with his head, without uttering a word, or inſtancing the leaſt civility. Pompey, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, took out a paper, on which he had minuted a ſpeech he intended to make to the king, and began reading it. In this manner they approached the ſhore; and Cornelia, whoſe concern had never ſuffered her to loſe ſight of her huſband, began to conceive hope, when ſhe perceived the people on the ſtrand crowding down along the coaſts, as if willing to receive him: but her hopes were ſoon deſtroyed; for that inſtant, as Pompey roſe, ſupporting himſelf upon his freed-man's arm,
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:021451_0153_0FB3F6E7A3885810"/>
Septimius ſtabbed him in the back, and was inſtantly ſeconded by Achillas. Pompey, perceiving his death inevitable, only diſpoſed himſelf to meet it with decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and, covering his face with his robe, without ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a word, with a ſigh reſigned himſelf to his fate. At this horrid ſight, Cornelia ſhrieked ſo loud as to be heard to the ſhore; but the danger ſhe herſelf was in did not allow the mariners time to look on: they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſet ſail, and, the wind proving favorable, fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately they eſcaped the purſuit of the Egyptian gallies. In the mean time, Pompey's murderers having cut off his head, cauſed it to be embalmed, the better to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve its features, deſigning it for a preſent to Caeſar. The body was thrown naked on the ſtrand, and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the view of all thoſe whoſe curioſity led them that way. However, his faithful freed-man Philip ſtill kept near it; and when the crowd was diſperſed, he waſhed it in the ſea: and looking round for materials to burn it with, he preceived the wreck of a fiſhing-boat; of which he compoſed a pile. While he was thus piouſly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, he was accoſted by an old Roman ſoldier who had ſerved under Pompey in his youth. "Who art thou," ſaid he, "that art making theſe humble pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations for Pompey's funeral?" Philip having an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered that he was one of his freed-men, "Alas," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the ſoldier, "permit me to ſhare in this honor alſo: among all the miſeries of my exile, it will be my laſt ſad comfort, that I have been able to aſſiſt at the funeral of my old commander, and touch the body of the braveſt general that ever Rome produced." After this they both joined in giving the corps the laſt rites; and, collecting his aſhes, buried them under a little ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing earth, ſcraped together with their hands; over which was a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>How then muſt I determine? Have I no intereſt at all? If I have not, I am a fool for ſtaying here: 'tis a ſmoky houſe, and the ſooner out of it the better. But why no intereſt?

The bee, the beaver, and the tribes of herd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing animals, are enow to convince me that the thing is ſomewhere at leaſt poſſible.

                  <head>IX. ON the PLEASURE ARISING from OBJECTS of SIGHT.</head>
                  <p>THOSE pleaſures of the imagination which ariſe from the actual view and ſurvey of outward objects, all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the ſight of what is great, uncommon or beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful.</p>
                  <p>By greatneſs, I do not only mean the bulk of any ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle object, but the largeneſs of a whole view conſidered as one entire piece. Such are the proſpects of an open champaign country, a vaſt uncultivated deſert, of huge heaps of mountains, high rocks and precipices, or a wide expanſe of waters, where we are not ſtruck with the novelty, or beauty of the ſight, but with that rude kind of magnificence which appears in many of theſe ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous works of nature. Our imagination loves to be filled with an object, or to graſp at any thing that is too big for its capacity. We are flung into a pleaſing aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment at ſuch unbounded views, and feel a delightful ſtillneſs and amazement in the ſoul at the apprehenſions of them. The mind of man naturally hates every thing that looks like a reſtraint upon it, and is apt to fancy it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under a ſort of confinement, when the ſight is pent up in a narrow compaſs, and ſhortened on every ſide by the neighbourhood of walls or mountains. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, a ſpacious horizon is an image of liberty, where the eye has room to range abroad, to expatiate at large on the immenſity of its views, and to loſe itſelf amidſt the variety of objects that offer themſelves to its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. Such wide and undetermined proſpects are as pleaſing to the fancy as the ſpeculations of eternity or infinitude are to the underſtanding. But if there be a beauty or uncommonneſs joined with this grandeur, as in a troubled ocean, a heaven adorned with ſtars and meteors, or a ſpacious landſcape cut out into rivers, woods, rocks, and meadows, the pleaſure ſtill grows up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, as it riſes from more than a ſingle principle.</p>
                  <p>Every thing that is new or uncommon raiſes a pleaſure in the imagination, becauſe it fills the ſoul with an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:021451_0157_0FB3F6ED9D859A18"/>
ſurpriſe, gratifies its curioſity, and gives it an idea of which it was not before poſſeſſed. We are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſo often converſant with one ſet of objects, and tired out with ſo many repeated ſhows of the ſame things, that whatever is new and uncommon, contributes a little to vary human life, and to divert our minds for a while with the ſtrangeneſs of its appearance; it ſerves us for a kind of refreſhment, and takes off from that ſatiety we are apt to complain of in our uſual and ordinary enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments. It is this that beſtows charms on a monſter, and makes even the imperfections of nature pleaſe us. It is this that recommends variety, where the mind is every inſtant called off to ſomething new, and the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention not ſuffered to dwell too long, and waſte itſelf on any particular object: it is this likewiſe, that improves what is great or beautiful, and makes it afford the mind a double entertainment. Groves, fields, and meadows, are at any ſeaſon of the year pleaſant to look upon; but never ſo much as in the opening of the ſpring, when they are all new and freſh, with their firſt gloſs upon them, and not yet too much accuſtomed and familiar to the eye. For this reaſon there is nothing that more enlivens a proſpect than rivers, jetteaus, or falls of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter where the ſcene is perpetually ſhifting, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the ſight every moment with ſomething that is new. We are quickly tired with looking upon hills and valleys, where every thing continues fixt and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed in the ſame place and poſture, but find our thoughts a little agitated and relieved at the ſight of ſuch objects as are ever in motion, and ſliding away from beneath the eye of the beholder.</p>
                  <p>But there is nothing that makes its way more directly to the ſoul than beauty, which immediately diffuſes a ſecret ſatisfaction and complacency through the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and gives a finiſhing to any thing that is great or uncommon. The very firſt diſcovery of it ſtrikes the mind with an inward joy, and ſpreads a cheerfulneſs and delight through all its faculties. There is not perhaps any real beauty or deformity more in one piece of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than another; becauſe we might have been ſo made, that whatſoever now appears loathſome to us might have ſhown itſelf agreeable; but we find by experience, that
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:021451_0158_0FB3F6EF1F3B9B00"/>
there are ſeveral modifications of matter, which the mind without any previous conſideration, pronounces at the firſt ſight beautiful or deformed. Thus we ſee that every different ſpecies of ſenſible creatures has its different notions of beauty, and that each of them is moſt affected with the beauties of its own kind. This is no where more remarkable than in birds of the ſame ſhape and proportion, where we often ſee the male deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in his courtſhip by the ſingle grain or tincture of a feather, and never diſcovering any charms but in the color of its ſpecies.</p>
                  <p>There is a ſecond kind of beauty that we find in the ſeveral products of art and nature, which does not work in the imagination with that w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> and violence as the beauty that appears in our proper ſpecies, but is apt however, to raiſe in us a ſecret delight, and a kind of fondneſs for the places or objects in which we diſcover it. This conſiſts either in the gaiety or variety of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, in the ſymmetry and proportion of parts, in the arrangement and diſpoſition of bodies, or in a juſt mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and concurrence of all together. Among theſe ſeveral kinds of beauty the eye takes moſt delight in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors. We no where meet with a more glorious or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſhow in nature, than what appears in the heavens at the riſing and ſetting of the ſun, which is wholly made up of thoſe different ſtains of light that ſhow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in clouds of a different ſituation. For this reaſon we find the poets, who are always addreſſing themſelves to the imagination, borrowing more of their epithets from colors than from any other topic.</p>
                  <p>As the fancy delights in every thing that is great, ſtrange or beautiful, and is ſtill more pleaſed the more it finds of theſe perfections in the ſame object; ſo it is capable of receiving a new ſatisfaction by the aſſiſtance of another ſenſe. Thus any continued ſound, as the muſic of birds, or the fall of water, awakens every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the mind of the beholder, and makes him more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to the ſeveral beauties of the place that lie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. Thus if there ariſes a fragrancy of ſmells or perfumes, they heighten the pleaſures of the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and make even the colors and verdure of the landſcape appear more agreeable: for the ideas of both
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:021451_0159_0FB3F6F09DECC058"/>
ſenſes recommend each other, and are pleaſanter toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than when they enter the mind ſeparately; as the different colors of a picture, when they are well diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſet off one another, and receive an additional beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from the advantage of their ſituation.</p>

                  <p>I was going to begin with the millions of my fellow-creatures, born to no inheritance but ſlavery; but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, however affecting the picture was, that I could not bring it near me, and that the multitude of ſad groups in it did but diſtract me, I took a ſingle captive; and, having firſt ſhut him up in his dungeon, I then looked through the twilight of his grated door, to take his picture.</p>
                  <p>I beheld his body half waſted away with long expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and confinement; and felt what kind of ſickneſs of the heart it is which ariſes from hope deferred.

                  <p>He was ſitting upon the ground, upon a little ſtraw in the fartheſt corner of his dungeon, which was alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately his chair and bed. A little calender of ſmall ſticks was laid at the head, notched all over with the diſmal days and nights he had paſſed there. He had one of theſe little ſticks in his hand; and, with a ruſty nail, he was etching another day of miſery, to add to the heap. As I darkened the little light he had, he lifted up a hopeleſs eye towards the door—then caſt it down— ſhook his head—and went on with his work of affliction. I heard his chains upon his legs, as he turned his body to lay his little ſtick upon the bundle.

                  <p>He was one evening ſitting thus at his ſupper, when the landlord of a little inn in the village came into the
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:021451_0162_0FB3F6F51E314F20"/>
parlor with an empty phial in his hand, to beg a glaſs or two of ſack: 'Tis for a poor gentleman,—I think of the army, ſaid the landlord, who has been taken ill at my houſe four days ago, and has never held up his head ſince, or had a deſire to taſte any thing, till juſt now, that he has a fancy for a glaſs of ſack and a thin toaſt, —"I think," ſays he, taking his hand from his fore-head, "it would comfort me."—</p>
                  <p>—If I could neither beg, borrow, nor buy ſuch a thing,—added the landlord,—I would almoſt ſteal it for the poor gentleman, he is ſo ill.—I hope he will ſtill mend, continued he;—we are all of us concerned for him.</p>
                  <p>Thou art a good-natured ſoul, I will anſwer for thee, cried my uncle Toby; and thou ſhalt drink the poor gentleman's health in a glaſs of ſack thyſelf,—and take a couple of bottles with my ſervice, and tell him he is heartily welcome to them, and to a dozen more, if they will do him good.</p>
                  <p>Though I am perſuaded, ſaid my uncle Toby, as the landlord ſhut the door, he is a very compaſſionate fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low—Trim,—yet I cannot help entertaining a high o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of his gueſt too; there muſt be ſomething more than common in him, that in ſo ſhort a time ſhould win ſo much upon the affections of his hoſt—And of his whole family, added the Corporal, for they are all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for him.—Step after him, ſaid my uncle Toby, —do Trim, and aſk if he knows his name.</p>
                  <p>—I have quite forgot it, truly, ſaid the landlord, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming back into the parlor with the Corporal,—but I can aſk his ſon again.—Has he a ſon with him then? ſaid my uncle Toby.—A boy, replied the landlord, of about eleven or twelve years of age;—but the poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has taſted almoſt as little as his father; he does no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but mourn and lament for him night and day:— He has not ſtirred from the bed-ſide theſe two days.</p>
                  <p>My uncle Toby laid down his knife and fork, and thruſt his plate from before him, as the landlord gave him the account; and Trim, without being ordered, took them away, without ſaying one word, and in a few minutes after brought him his pipe and tobacco.</p>
                  <p>Trim! ſaid my uncle Toby, I have a project in my head, as it is a bad night, of wrapping myſelf up warm in
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:021451_0163_0FB3F6F69D90FC28"/>
my roquelaure, and paying a viſit to this poor gentleman. —Your honor's roquelaure, replied the Corporal, has not once been had on ſince the night before your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor received your wound, when we mounted guard in the trenches before the gate of St. Nicholas;—and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it is ſo cold and rainy a night, that what with the roquelaure, and what with the weather, it will be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to give your honor your death. I fear ſo, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied my uncle Toby: but I am not at reſt in my mind, Trim, ſince the account the landlord has given me—I wiſh I had not known ſo much of this affair,—added my uncle Toby,—or that I had known more of it:— How ſhall we manage it? Leave it, an't pleaſe your honor, to me, quoth the Corporal;—I'll take my hat and ſtick, and go to the houſe and reconnoitre, and act accordingly; and I will bring your honor a full account in an hour.—Thou ſhalt go, Trim, ſaid my uncle Toby, and here's a ſhilling for thee to drink with his ſervant.— I ſhall get all out of him, ſaid the Corporal ſhutting the door.</p>
                  <p>It was not till uncle Toby had knocked the aſhes out of his third pipe that Corporal Trim returned from the inn, and gave the following account.</p>
                  <p>I deſpaired at firſt, ſaid the Corporal, of being able to bring back your honor any kind of intelligence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the poor ſick Lieutenant—Is he in the army, then? ſaid my uncle Toby—He is, ſaid the corporal— and in what regiment ſaid my uncle Toby—I'll tell your honor, replied the Corporal, every thing ſtraight forward, as I learnt it.—Then, Trim, I'll fill another pipe, ſaid my uncle Toby, and not interrupt thee; ſo ſit down at thy eaſe, Trim, in the window ſeat, and begin thy ſtory again. The Corporal made his old bow, which gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſpoke as plain as a bow could ſpeak it, "Your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor is good:"—And having done that, he ſat down, as he was ordered,—and began the ſtory to my uncle To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by over again in pretty near the ſame words.</p>
                  <p>I deſpaired at firſt, ſaid the Corporal, of being able to bring back any intelligence to your honor about the Lieutenant and his ſon; for when I aſked where his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant was from whom I made myſelf ſure of knowing every thing which was proper to be aſked,—That's a
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:021451_0164_0FB3F6F81D8ED178"/>
right diſtinction, Trim, ſaid my uncle Toby—I was anſwered, an't pleaſe your honor, that he had no ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant with him:—that he had come to the inn with hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red horſes; which, upon finding himſelf unable to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed (to join, I ſuppoſe, the regiment), he had diſmiſſed the morning after he came.—If I get better, my dear, ſaid he, as he gave his purſe to his ſon to pay the man,— we can hire horſes from hence.—But, alas! the poor gentleman will never get from hence, ſaid the landlady to me,—for I heard the death watch all night long;— and when he dies the youth, his ſon, will certainly die with him; for he is broken-hearted already.</p>
                  <p>I was hearing this account continued the Corporal, when the youth came into the kitchen, to order the thin toaſt the landlord ſpoke of;—but I will do it for my father myſelf ſaid the youth.—Pray let me ſave you the trouble, young gentleman, ſaid I, taking up a fork for the purpoſe, and offering him my chair to ſit down upon by the fire, whilſt I did it.—I believe, Sir, ſaid he, very modeſtly, I can pleaſe him beſt myſelf.—I am ſure, ſaid I, his honor will not like the toaſt the worſe for being toaſted by an old ſoldier.—The youth took hold of my hand, and inſtantly burſt into tears. Poor youth! ſaid my uncle Toby,—he has been bred up from an infant in the army, and the name of a ſoldier, Trim, ſounded in his ears like the name of a friend; I wiſh I had him here.</p>
                  <p>—I never in the longeſt march, ſaid the Corporal, had ſo great a mind to my dinner, as I had to cry with him for company:—What could be the matter with me an pleaſe your honor? Nothing in the world, Trim, ſaid my uncle Toby, blowing his noſe,—but that thou art a good-natured fellow.</p>
                  <p>When I gave him the toaſt, continued the Corporal, I thought it was proper to tell him I was Captain Shan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's ſervant, and that your honor (though a ſtranger) was extremely concerned for his father; and that if there was any thing in your houſe or cellar—(and thou might'ſt have added my purſe too, ſaid my uncle Toby), —he was heartily welcome to it:—He made a very low bow (which was meant to your honor), but no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer—for his heart was full—ſo he went up ſtairs with
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:021451_0165_0FB3F6F99C234328"/>
the toaſt;—I warrant you, my dear, ſaid I, as I open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the kitchen-door, your father will be well again— Mr. Yorick's curate was ſmoaking a pipe by the kitchen-fire,—but ſaid not a word good or bad to comfort the youth.—I thought it wrong; added the corporal—I think ſo too, ſaid my uncle Toby.</p>
                  <p>When the Lieutenant had taken his glaſs of ſack and toaſt, he felt himſelf a little revived, and ſent down into the kitchen to let me know, that in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>bout ten minutes he ſhould be glad if I would ſtep up ſtairs.—I believe, ſaid the Landlord, he is going to ſay his prayers,—for there was a book laid upon the chair by his bed-ſide, and as I ſhut the door, I ſaw his ſon take up a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion.—</p>
                  <p>I thought, ſaid the curate, that you gentlemen of the army, Mr. Trim, never ſaid your prayers at all.—I heard the poor gentleman ſay his prayers laſt night, ſaid the landlady, very devoutly, and with my own ears, or I could not have believed it.—Are you ſure of it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the curate.—A ſoldier, an' pleaſe your reverence, ſaid I, prays as often (of his own accord) as a parſon;— and when he is fighting for his king, and for his own life, and for his honor too, he has the moſt reaſon to pray to God of any one in the whole world.—'Twas well ſaid of thee, Trim ſaid my uncle Toby.—But when a ſoldier, ſaid I, an' pleaſe your reverence, has been ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for twelve hours together, in the trenches, up to his knees in cold water,—or engaged, ſaid I, for months together in long and dangerous marches; haraſſed, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, in his rear to-day; haraſſing others to-morrow; —detached here;—countermanded there;—reſting this night out upon his arms?—beat up in his ſhirt the next: —benumbed in his joints;—perhaps without ſtraw in his tent to kneel on;—he muſt ſay his prayers how and when he can—I believe, ſaid I,—for I was piqued, quoth the corporal, for the reputation of the army—I believe, an' pleaſe your reverence, ſaid I, that when a ſoldier gets time to pray,—he prays as heartily as a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,—though not with all his fuſs and hypocriſy.— Thou ſhouldſt not have ſaid that, Trim, ſaid my uncle Toby,—for God only knows who is a hypocrite, and who is not:—At the great and general review of us all,
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:021451_0166_0FB3F6FB23733200"/>
Corporal, at the day of judgment, (and not till then)— it will be ſeen who have done their duties in this world, —and who have not; and we ſhall be advanced, Trim, accordingly.—I hope we ſhall, ſaid Trim.—It is in the Scripture, ſaid my uncle Toby; and I will ſhow it thee to-morrow:—In the mean time we may depend upon it, Trim, for our comfort, ſaid my uncle Toby, that God Almighty is ſo good and juſt a governor of the world, that if we have but done our duties in it,—it will never be inquired into, whether we have done them in a red coat or a black one:—I hope not; ſaid the Corporal.—But go on, Trim, ſaid my uncle Toby; with the ſtory.</p>
                  <p>When I went up, continued the Corporal, into the Lieutenant's room, which I did not do till the expira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ten minutes,—he was lying in his bed, with his head raiſed upon his hand, with his elbow upon the pillow, and a clean white cambric hankerchief beſide it:—The youth was juſt ſtooping down to take up the cuſhion, upon which I ſuppoſed he had been kneeling, —the book was laid upon the bed,—and as he roſe, in taking up the cuſhion with one hand, he reached out his other to take the book away at the ſame time. Let it remain there, my dear, ſaid the Lieutenant.</p>
                  <p>He did not offer to ſpeak to me, till I had walked up cloſe to his bed-ſide: If you are Captain Shandy's ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant ſaid he, you muſt preſent my thanks to your maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, with my little boy's thanks along with them, for his courteſy to me;—if he was of Levan's—ſaid he Lieutenant.—I told him your honor was—Then, ſaid he, I ſerved three campaigns with him in Flanders, and remember him,—but 'tis moſt likely, as I had not the honor of any acquaintance with him, that he knows nothing of me.—You will tell him, however, that the perſon his good nature has laid under obligations to him, is one Le Fever, a Lieutenant in Ang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Your honor, replied the Corporal, is too much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned;—ſhall I pour your honor out a glaſs of ſack to your pipe?—Do, Trim, ſaid my uncle Toby.</p>
                  <p>I remember, ſaid my uncle Toby, ſighing again, the ſtory of the Enſign and his wife,—and particularly well that he, as well as ſhe, upon ſome account or other, (I forget what), was univerſally pitied by the whole regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;—but finiſh the ſtory:—'Tis finiſhed already, ſaid the Corporal,—for I could ſtay no longer,—ſo wiſhed his honor a good night; young Le Fever roſe from off the bed, and ſaw me to the bottom of the ſtairs; and as we went down together, told me, they had come from Ireland, and were on their route to join the regiment in Flanders.—But alas! ſaid the Corporal,—the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant's laſt day's march is over.—Then what is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of his poor boy? cried my uncle Toby.</p>
                  <p>Thou haſt left this matter ſhort, ſaid my uncle Toby to the Corporal, as he was putting him to bed,—and I will tell thee in what, Trim—In the firſt place, when thou madeſt an offer of my ſervices to Le Fever,—as ſickneſs and travelling are both expenſive, and thou kneweſt he was but a poor Lieutenant, with a ſon to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>—The ACCUSING SPIRIT, which flew up to Heaven's chancery with the oath, bluſh'd as he gave it in:—and the RECORDING ANGEL, as he wrote it down, dropped a tear upon the word, and blotted it out for ever.</p>
                  <p>—My uncle Toby went to his bureau,—put his purſe into his pocket, and having ordered the Corporal to go early in the morning for a phyſician,—he went to bed and fell aſleep.</p>
                  <p>The ſun looked bright the morning after to every eye in the village but Le Fever's and his afflicted ſon's; the hand of death preſſed heavy upon his eye-lids,—and hardly could the wheel at the ciſtern turn round its circle,—when my uncle Toby, who had got up an hour before his wonted time, entered the Lieutenant's room, and without preface or apology, ſat himſelf down upon the chair by the bed-ſide, and independently of all modes and cuſtoms, opened the curtain in the manner an old friend and brother officer would have done it, and aſked him how he did,—how he had reſted in the night.— what was his complaint,—where was his pain,—and
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:021451_0169_0FB3F6FF9CD88D50"/>
what he could do to help him?—and without giving him time to anſwer any one of the inquiries, went on and told him of the little plan which he had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certing with the Corporal the night before for him—</p>
                  <p>—You ſhall go home directly, Le Fever, ſaid my uncle Toby, to my houſe,—and we'll ſend for a doctor to ſee what's the matter,—and we'll have an apothecary, —and the Corporal ſhall be your nurſe,—and I'll be your ſervant, Le Fever.</p>
                  <p>There was a frankneſs in my uncle Toby,—not the effect of familiarity,—but the cauſe of it,—which let you at once into his ſoul,—and ſhowed you the goodneſs of his nature; to this, there was ſomething in his looks, and voice, and manner, ſuperadded, which eternally beckoned to the unfortunate to come and take ſhelter under him; ſo that before my uncle Toby had half finiſhed the kind offers he was making to the father, had the ſon inſenſible preſſed up cloſe to his knees, and had taken hold of the breaſt of his coat, and was pulling it towards him.—The blood and ſpirits of Le Fever, which were waxing cold and ſlow within him, and were retreating to their laſt citadel, the heart,—rallied back,—the film forſook his eyes for a moment,—he looked up wiſhfully in my uncle Toby's face,—then caſt a look upon his boy.—</p>
                  <p>Nature inſtantly ebb'd again,—<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>That my uncle Toby, with young Le Fever in his hand, attended the poor Lieutenant, as chief mourners, to his grave.</p>
                  <p>When my uncle Toby had turned every thing into money, and ſettled all accounts betwixt the agent of the regiment and Le Fever, and betwixt Le Fever and all mankind,—there remained nothing more in my uncle Toby's hands than an old regimental coat and a ſword; ſo that my uncle Toby found little or no oppoſition from the world in taking adminiſtration. The coat my uncle Toby gave the Corporal;—Wear it, Trim, ſaid my uncle Toby, as long as it will hold together, for the ſake of the poor Lieutenant—And this, ſaid my uncle

                  <l>Behold four kings, in majeſty rever'd,</l>
                  <l>With hoary whiſkers, and a forky beard;</l>
                  <l>And four fair queens, whoſe hands ſuſtain a flow'r,</l>

                     <l>Had two ſtone-bottles found,</l>

                  <head>I. On TRUTH and INTEGRITY.</head>
                  <p>TRUTH and integrity have all the advantages of appearance, and many more. If the ſhow of any thing be good for any thing, I am ſure the reality is better; for why does any man diſſemble, or ſeem to be that which he is not, but becauſe he thinks it good to have the qualities he pretends to? for to counterfeit and diſſemble, is to put on the appearance of ſome real excellency. Now, the beſt way for a man to ſeem to be any thing, is really to be what he would ſeem to be. Beſides, it is often as troubleſome to ſupport the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a good quality, as to have it; and if a man have it not, it is moſt likely he will be diſcovered to want it; and then all his labor to ſeem to have it is loſt. There is ſomething unnatural in painting, which a ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful eye will eaſily diſcern from native beauty and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion.</p>
                  <p>It is hard to perſonate and act a part long; for, where truth is not at the bottom, nature will always be endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voring to return, and will betray herſelf at one time or other. Therefore, if any man think it convenient to ſeem good, let him be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

conſcience, but, which is much more, to God, who ſearcheth our hearts. So that, upon all accounts, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity is true wiſdom. Particularly, as to the affairs of this world, integrity hath many advantages over all the artificial modes of diſſimulation and deceit. It is much the plainer and eaſier, much the ſafer and more ſecure way of dealing in the world; it hath leſs of trouble and difficulty, of entanglement and perplexity, of danger and hazard, in it; it is the ſhorteſt and neareſt way to our end, carrying us thither in a ſtraight line; and will hold out and laſt longeſt. The arts of deceit and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning continually grow weaker and leſs effectual and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to thoſe that practiſe them: whereas integrity gains ſtrength by uſe; and the more and longer any man practiſeth it, the greater ſervice it does him, by confirming his reputation, and encouraging thoſe with whom he hath to do, to repoſe the greateſt confidence in him; which is an unſpeakable advantage in buſineſs and the affairs of life.</p>
                  <p>A diſſembler muſt always be upon his guard, and watch himſelf carefully, that he do not contradict his own pretenſions; for he acts an unnatural part, and therefore muſt put a continual force and reſtraint upon himſelf: whereas he that acts ſincerely, hath the eaſieſt taſk in the world; becauſe he follows nature, and ſo is put to no trouble and care about his words and actions; he needs not invent any pretences before hand, nor make excuſes afterwards, for any thing he hath ſaid or done.</p>
                  <p>But in ſincerity is very troubleſome to manage. A hypocrite hath ſo many things to attend to, as make his life a very perplexed and intricate thing. A liar hath need of a good memory, leſt he contradict at one time what he ſaid at another. But truth is always conſiſtent with itſelf, and needs nothing to help it out; it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways near at hand, and ſits upon our lips, and is ready to drop out before we are aware; whereas a lie is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome, and one trick needs a great many more to make it good.</p>

and brings things to an iſſue in a few words. It is like travelling in a plain beaten road, which commonly brings a man ſooner to his journey's end than by-ways, in which men often loſe themſelves. In a word, whatever convenience may be thought to be in falſehood and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation, it is ſoon over; but the inconvenience of it is perpetual, becauſe it brings a man under an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing jealouſy and ſuſpicion, ſo that he is not believed when he ſpeaks truth, nor truſted when perhaps he means honeſtly. When a man hath once forfeited the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his integrity, nothing will then ſerve his turn, neither truth nor falſehood.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, if a man were only to deal in the world for a day, and ſhould never have occaſion to converſe more with mankind, never more need their good opinion or good word, it were then no great matter (as far as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the affairs of this world) if he ſpent his reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion all at once, and ventured it at one throw. But, if he be to continue in the world, and would have the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of reputation whilſt he is in it, let him make uſe of ſincerity in all his words and actions, for nothing but this will hold out to the end. All other arts will fail; but truth and integrity will carry a man through, and bear him out to the laſt.</p>

                  <head>II. ON DOING AS WE WOULD BE DONE UNTO.</head>
                  <p>HUMAN laws are often ſo numerous as to eſcape our memories; ſo darkly ſometimes, and inconſiſtently worded, as to puzzle our underſtandings; and their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal obſcurity is not ſeldom improved by the nice di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions and ſubtle reaſonings of thoſe who profeſs to clear them: ſo that, under theſe ſeveral diſadvantages, they loſe much of their force and influence; and, in ſome caſes, raiſe more diſputes than, perhaps, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine. But here is a law, attended with none of theſe inconveniences; the groſſeſt minds can ſcarce miſappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it; the weakeſt memories are capable of retaining it; no perplexing comment can eaſily cloud it; the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of no man's gloſs upon earth can (if we are but ſincere) ſway us to make a wrong conſtruction of it. What is ſaid of all the goſpel precepts by the evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical prophet, is more eminently true of this: "It is an
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:021451_0245_0FB5CF85ABDB8DE8"/>
high-way; and the wayfareing man, though a fool, ſhall not err therein."</p>
                  <p>It is not enough that a rule, which is to be of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral uſe, is ſuited to all capacities, ſo that, where-ever it is repreſented to the mind, it is preſently agreed to; it muſt alſo be apt to offer itſelf to our thoughts, and lie ready for preſent uſe, upon all exigencies and occaſions. And ſuch, remarkably ſuch, is that which our Lord here recommends to us, we can ſcarce be ſo far ſurpriſed by any immediate neceſſity of acting, as not to have time for a ſhort recourſe to it, room for a ſuddden glance as it were upon it, in our minds; where it reſts and ſparkles always, like the Urim and Thummim on the breaſt of Aaron. There is no occaſion for us to go in ſearch of it to the oracles of law, dead or living: to the code or pandects: to the volumes of divines or moraliſts: We need look no further than ourſelves for it: for (to uſe the appoſite expreſſions of Moſes), "This command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which I command thee this day, is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off. It is not in heaven, that thou ſhouldſt ſay, Who ſhall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it? Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>their is it beyond the ſea, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>It is, moreover, a precept particularly fitted for prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; as it involves in the very notion of it a motive ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring us up to do what it enjoins. Other moral maxims propoſe naked truths to the underſtanding, which ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate often but faintly and ſlowly on the will and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, the two active principles of the mind of man: but it is the peculiar character of this, that it addreſſeth it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf equally to all theſe powers; imparts both light and heat to us; and at the ſame time that it informs us cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly and clearly what we are to do, excites us alſo, in the moſt tender and moving manner to the performance of it. We can ſee our neighbor's misfortune, without a ſenſible degree of concern; which yet we cannot forbear expreſſing, when we have once made his condition our own, and determined the meaſure of our obligation to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

him, by what we ourſelves ſhould, in ſuch a caſe, expect from him: our duty grows immediately our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and pleaſure, by means of this powerful prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; the ſeat of which is, in truth, not more in the brain, than in the heart of man: it appeals to our very ſenſes; and exerts its ſecret force in ſo prevailing a way, that it is even felt, as well as underſtood by us.</p>
                  <p>The laſt recommendation of this rule I ſhall mention, is its vaſt and comprehenſive influence: for it extends to all ranks and conditions of men, and to all kinds of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and intercourſe between them; to matters of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, generoſity, and civility, as well as juſtice; to nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive no leſs than poſitive duties. The ruler and the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led are alike ſubject to it; public communities can no more exempt themſelves from its obligation than private perſons: "All perſons muſt fall down before it, all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions muſt do it ſervice." And, with reſpect to this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of it, it is, that our bleſſed Lord pronounces it in the text to be "the law and the prophets." His mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, that whatever rules of the ſecond table are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in the law of Moſes, or in the larger comments and explanations of that law made by the other writers of the Old Teſtament (here and elſewhere ſtyled the prophets), they are all virtually compriſed in this one ſhort ſignificant ſaying, "Whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do unto you, do ye even ſo unto them."</p>

He ſtrives to out do his friends in good offices, and overcome his enemies by them. He thinks he then receives the greateſt injury when he returns and revenges one: for then he is "overcome of evil." Is the perſon young who has injured him? He will reflect, that inexperience of the world, and a warmth of conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, may betray his unpractiſed years into ſeveral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertencies, which a more advanced age, his own good ſenſe, and the advice of a judicious friend, will correct and rectify. Is he old? The infirmities of age and want of health may have ſet an edge upon his ſpirits, and made him "ſpeak unadviſedly with his lips." Is he weak and ignorant? He conſiders that it is a duty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent upon the wiſe to bear with thoſe that are not ſo. "Ye ſuffer fools gladly," ſays St Paul, "ſeeing ye yourſelves are wiſe." In ſhort, he judges of himſelf, as far as he can, with the ſtrict rigor of juſtice; but of others, with the ſoftenings of humanity,</p>
                  <p>From charitable and benevolent thoughts, the tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is unavoidable to charitable actions. For wherever there is an inexhauſtible fund of goodneſs at the heart, it will, under all the diſadvantages of circumſtances, exert itſelf in acts of ſubſtantial kindneſs. He that is ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially good, will be doing good. The man that has a hearty determinate will to be charitable, will ſeldom put men off with the mere will for the deed. For a ſincere deſire to do good, implies ſome uneaſineſs till the thing be done: and uneaſineſs ſets the mind at work, and puts it upon the ſtretch to find out a thouſand ways and means of obliging, which will ever eſcape the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, the indifferent, and the unfeeling.</p>
                  <p>The moſt proper objects of your bounty are the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitious. Give the ſame ſum of money, which you beſtow on a perſon in tolerable circumſtances, to one in extreme poverty; and obſerve what a wide diſproportion of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs is produced. In the latter caſe, it is like giving a cordial to a fainting perſon; in the former, it is like giving wine to him who has already quenched his thirſt.
<q>Mercy is ſeaſonable in time of affliction, like clouds of rain in the time of drought.</q>

And they are to be relieved in ſuch an endearing manner, with ſuch a beauty of holineſs, that, at the ſame time that their wants are ſupplied, their confuſion of face may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.</p>
                  <p>There is not an inſtance of this kind in hiſtory ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting, as that beautiful one of Boaz to Ruth. He knew her family, and how ſhe was reduced to the loweſt ebb; when therefore ſhe begged leave to glean in his fields, he ordered his reapers to let fall ſeveral handfuls with a ſeeming careleſſneſs, but really with a ſet deſign, that ſhe might gather them up without being aſhamed. Thus did he form an artful ſcheme, that he might give, without the vanity and oſtentation of giving; and ſhe receive, without the ſhame and confuſion of making ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments. Take the hiſtory in the words of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as it is recorded in the book of Ruth. "And when ſhe was riſen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, ſaying, Let her glean even among the ſheaves, and rebuke her not: and let fall alſo ſome of the handfuls of purpoſe, and leave them that ſhe may glean them, and reproach her not." This was not only doing a good action; it was doing it likewiſe with a good grace.</p>
                  <p>It is not enough we do no harm, that we be negative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good; we muſt do good, poſitive good, if we would "enter into life." When it would have been as good for the world, if ſuch a man had never lived; it would perhaps have been better for him, "if he had never beer born." A ſcanty fortune may limit your beneficence, and confine it chiefly to the circle of your domeſtics, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and neighbors; but let your benevolence ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend as far as thought can travel, to the utmoſt bounds of the world: juſt as it may be only in your power to beautify the ſpot of ground that lies near and cloſe to

                  <head>IV. ON HAPPINESS.</head>
                  <p>THE great purſuit of man is after happineſs: it is the firſt and ſtrongeſt deſire of his nature;—in every ſtage of his life he ſearches for it as for hid trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;—courts it under a thouſand different ſhapes;— and, though perpetually diſappointed,—ſtill perſiſts— runs after and enquires for it afreſh—aſks every paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger who comes in his way, "Who will ſhow him any good?"—who will aſſiſt him in the attainment of it, or direct him to the diſcovery of this great end of all his wiſhes?</p>
                  <p>He is told by one, to ſearch for it among the more gay and youthful pleaſures of life; in ſcenes of mirth and ſprightlineſs, where happineſs ever preſides, and is ever to be known by the joy and laughter which he will ſee at once painted in her looks.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond, with a graver aſpect, points out to him the coſtly dwellings which pride and extravagance have erected:—tells the enquirer that the object he is in ſearch of inhabits there;—that happineſs lives only in company with the great, in the midſt of much pomp and outward ſtate. That he will eaſily find her out by the coat of many colors ſhe has on, and the great luxury and expence of equipage and furniture with which ſhe always ſits ſurrounded.</p>
                  <p>The miſer wonders how any one would miſlead and wilfully put him upon ſo wrong a ſcent—convinces him that happineſs and extravagance never inhabited under the ſame roof:—that, if he would not be diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in his ſearch, he muſt look into the plain and thrifty dwelling of the prudent man, who knows and underſtands the worth of money, and cautiouſly lays it up againſt an evil hour: that it is not the proſtitution of wealth upon the paſſions, or the parting with it at all, that conſtitutes happineſs—but that it is the keeping it together, and the having and holding it faſt to him and his heirs for ever, which are the chief at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:021451_0250_0FB3F7791CBE94E0"/>
that form this great idol of human worſhip, to which ſo much incenſe is offered up every day.</p>
                  <p>The epicure, though he eaſily rectifies ſo groſs a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, yet at the ſame time he plunges him, if poſſible, into a greater; for, hearing the object of his purſuit to be happineſs, and knowing of no other happineſs than what is ſeated immediately in his ſenſes—he ſends the enquirer there;—tells him 'tis in vain to ſearch elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where for it, than where nature herſelf has placed it— in the indulgence and gratification of the appetites, which are given us for that end: and in a word—if he will not take his opinion in the matter—he may truſt the word of a much wiſer man, who has aſſured us— that there is nothing better in this world, than that a man ſhould eat and drink and rejoice in his works, and make his ſoul enjoy good in his labor—for that is his portion.</p>
                  <p>To reſcue him from this brutal experiment—ambition takes him by the hand and carries him into the world, —ſhows him all the kingdoms of the earth and the glory of them—points out the many ways of advancing his fortune and raiſing himſelf to honor,—lays before his eyes all the charms and bewitching temptations of power, and aſks if there be any happineſs in this world like that of being careſſed, courted, flattered, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed?</p>
                  <p>To cloſe all, the philoſopher meets him buſtling in the full career of this purſuit—ſtops him—tells him, if he is in ſearch of happineſs, he is far gone out of his way:—that this deity has long been baniſhed from noiſe and tumults, where there was no reſt found for her, and was fled into ſolitude far from all commerce of the world; and, in a word, if he would find her, he muſt leave this buſy and intriguing ſcene, and go back to that peaceful ſcene of retirement and books from which he firſt ſet out.</p>
                  <p>In this circle, too often does a man run, tries all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, and generally ſits down wearied and diſſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with them all at laſt—in utter deſpair of ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing what he wants—nor knowing what to truſt to after ſo many diſappointments—or where to lay the
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:021451_0251_0FB3F77A9DD57F38"/>
fault, whether in the incapacity of his own nature, or the inſufficiency of the enjoyments themſelves.</p>
                  <p>In this uncertain and perplexed ſtate—without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which way to turn or where to betake ourſelves for refuge—ſo often abuſed and deceived by the many who pretend thus to ſhow us any good—Lord! ſays the Pſalmiſt, lift up the light of thy countenance upon us. Send us ſome rays of thy grace and heavenly wiſdom, in this benighted ſearch after happineſs, to direct us ſafely to it. O God! let us not wander for ever without a guide, in this dark region, in endleſs purſuit of our miſtaken good; but enlighten our eyes that we ſleep not in death—open to them the comforts of thy holy word and religion—lift up the light of thy countenance upon us,—and make us know the joy and ſatisfaction of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the true faith and fear of Thee, which only can carry us to this haven of reſt where we would be—that ſure haven, where true joys are to be found, which will at length not only anſwer all our expectations— but ſatisfy the moſt unbounded of our wiſhes for ever and ever.</p>
                  <p>There is hardly any ſubject more exhauſted, or which at one time or other has afforded more matter for argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and declamation, than this one, of the inſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of our enjoyments. Scarce a reformed ſenſualiſt, from Solomon down to our own days, who has not, in ſome fits of repentance or diſappointment, uttered ſome ſharp reflection upon the emptineſs of human pleaſure, and of the vanity of vanities which diſcovers itſelf in all the purſuits of mortal man.—But the miſchief has been, that, though ſo many good things have been ſaid, they have generally had the fate to be conſidered, either as the overflowings of diſguſt from ſated appetites which could no longer reliſh the pleaſures of life, or as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamatory opinions of recluſe and ſplenetic men, who had never taſted them at all, and, conſequently, were thought no judges of the matter. So that 'tis no great wonder, if the greateſt part of ſuch reflections, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever juſt in themſelves, and founded on truth and a knowledge of the world, are found to leave little im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion where the imagination was already heated with great expectations of future happineſs; and that the beſt
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:021451_0252_0FB3F77DB07F2170"/>
lectures that have been read upon the vanity of the world, ſo ſeldom ſtop a man in the purſuit of the object of his deſire, or give him half the conviction, that the poſſeſſion of it will, and what the experience of his own life, or a careful obſervation upon the life of others, do at length generally confirm to us all.</p>
                  <p>I would not be underſtood as if I was denying the reality of pleaſures, or diſputing the being of them, any more than one would the reality of pain—yet I muſt obſerve, that there is a plain diſtinction to be made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt pleaſures and happineſs. For though there can be no happineſs without pleaſure—yet the reverſe of the propoſition will not hold true.—We are ſo made, that, from the common gratifications of our appetites, and the impreſſions of a thouſand objects, we ſnatch the one like a tranſient gleam, without being ſuffered to taſte the other and enjoy the perpetual ſunſhine and fair weather which conſtantly attend it. This, I contend, is only to be found in religion—in the conſciouſneſs of virtue—and the ſure and certain hopes of a better life, which brightens all our proſpects, and leaves no room to dread diſappointments—becauſe the expectation of it is built upon a rock whoſe foundations are as deep as thoſe of heaven and hell.</p>
                  <p>And though, in our pilgrimage through this world— ſome of us may be ſo fortunate as to meet with ſome clear fountains by the way that may cool, for a few moments, the heat of this great thirſt of happineſs—yet our Saviour, who knew the world, though he enjoyed but little of it, tells us, that whoſoever drinketh of this water will thirſt again:—and we all find by experience it is ſo, and by reaſon that it always muſt be ſo.</p>
                  <p>I conclude with a ſhort obſervation upon Solomon's evidence in this caſe.</p>
                  <p>Never did the buſy brain of a lean and hectic chymiſt ſearch for the philoſopher's ſtone with more pains and ardor than this great man did after happineſs. He was one of the wiſeſt enquirers into nature—had tried all her powers and capacities; and, after a thouſand vain ſpeculations and vile experiments, he affirmed at length, it lay hid in no one thing he had tried: like the chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt's projections, all had ended in ſmoke, or, what was

                  <head>V. ON THE DEATH OF CHRIST.</head>
                  <p>THE Redemption of man is one of the moſt glorious works of the Almighty. If the hour of the creation of the world was great and illuſtrious; that hour, when, from the dark and formleſs maſs, this fair ſyſtem of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture aroſe at the Divine command; when "the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtars ſang together, and all the ſons of God ſhouted for joy;"—no leſs illuſtrious is the hour of the reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world; the hour, when, from condemnation and miſery, it emerged into happineſs and peace. With leſs external majeſty it was attended, but is, on that account, the more wonderful, that, under an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance ſo ſimple, ſuch great events were covered.</p>
                  <p>In the hour of Chriſt's death the long ſeries of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, viſions, types, and figures, was accompliſhed. This was the center in which they all met; this the point towards which they had tended and verged, throughout the courſe of ſo many generations. You behold the Law and the Prophets ſtanding, if we may ſo ſpeak, at the foot of the croſs, and doing homage. You behold Moſes and Aaron bearing the ark of the covenant; David and Elijah preſenting the oracle of teſtimony. You behold all the prieſts and ſacrifices, all the rites and ordinances, all the types and ſymbols, aſſembled together to receive their conſummation. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the death of Chriſt, the worſhip and ceremonies of the law would have remained a pompous, but unmean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſtitution. In the hour when he was crucified, "the book with the ſeven ſeals" was opened. Every rite aſſumed its ſignificancy; every prediction met its event; every ſymbol diſplayed its correſpondence.</p>
                  <p>This was the hour of the abolition of the Law, and the introduction of the Goſpel; the hour of terminating the old, and of beginning the new diſpenſation of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious knowledge and worſhip throughout the earth. Viewed in this light, it forms the moſt auguſt aera which is to be found in the hiſtory of mankind. When Chriſt was ſuffering on the croſs, we are informed by one of
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:021451_0254_0FB3F7809E173B58"/>
the Evangeliſts, that he ſaid, "I thirſt;" and that they filled a ſpunge with vinegar, and put it to his mouth. "After he had taſted the vinegar, knowing that all things were now accompliſhed, and the ſcripture ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, he ſaid, "It is finiſhed;" that is, This offered draught of vinegar was the laſt circumſtance predicted by an ancient prophet that remained to be fulfilled. The viſion and the prophecy are now ſealed: the Moſaic diſpenſation is cloſed. "And he bowed his head, and gave up the ghoſt."—Significantly was the veil of the temple rent in this hour; for the glory then departed from between the cherubims. The legal high-prieſt delivered up his Urim and Thummim, his breaſt-plate, his robes, and his incenſe; and CHRIST ſtood forth as the great High-prieſt of all ſucceeding generations. By that one ſacrifice which he now offered, he aboliſhed ſacrifices for ever. Altars on which the fire had blazed for ages were now to ſmoke no more. Victims were no more to bleed. "Not with the blood of bulls and goats, but with his own blood, he now entered into the Holy Place, there to appear in the preſence of God for us"</p>
                  <p>This was the hour of aſſociation and union to all the worſhippers of God. When Chriſt ſaid "It is finiſhed," he threw down the wall of partition which had ſo long divided the Gentile from the Jew. He gathered into one all the faithful, out of every kindred and people. He proclaimed the hour to be come, when the knowledge of the true God ſhould be no longer confined to one nation, nor his worſhip to one temple; but over all the earth, the worſhippers of the Father ſhould "ſerve him in ſpirit and in truth." From that hour, they who dwelt in the "uttermoſt ends of the earth, ſtrangers to the covenant of promiſe," began to be "brought nigh." In that hour, the light of the goſpel dawned from afar on the Britiſh iſlands.</p>
                  <p>This was the hour of Chriſt's triumph over all the powers of darkneſs; the hour in which he overthrew dominions and thrones, "led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men. The conteſt which the kingdom of darkneſs had long maintained againſt the kingdom of light, was now brought to its criſis. The period was come, when "the ſeed of the woman ſhould bruiſe the
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:021451_0255_0FB3F7821CA3DD08"/>
head of the ſerpent." For many ages, the moſt groſs ſuperſtition had filled the earth. "The glory of the incorruptible God was" every where, except in the land of Judea, "changed into images made like to corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible man, and to birds, and beaſts, and creeping things." The world, which the Almighty created for himſelf, ſeemed to have become a temple of idols. Even to vices and paſſions altars were raiſed; and, what was intitled Religion, was, in effect, a diſcipline of impurity. In the midſt of this univerſal darkneſs, Satan had erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his throne; and the learned and poliſhed, as well as the ſavage nations, bowed down before him. But at the hour when Chriſt appeared on the croſs, the ſignal of his defeat was given. His kingdom ſuddenly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from him; the reign of Idolatry paſſed away: He was "beheld to fall like lightening from heaven." In that hour, the foundation of every Pagan temple ſhook; the ſtatute of every falſe god tottered on its baſe. The prieſt fled from his falling ſhrine; and the heathen oracles became dumb for ever.</p>
                  <p>Death alſo, the laſt foe of man, was the victim of this hour. The formidable appearance of the ſpectre remained, but his dart was taken away: for, in the hour when Chriſt expiated guilt, he diſarmed death, by ſecuring the reſurrection of the juſt. When he ſaid to his penitent fellow-ſufferer, "To-day thou ſhalt be with me in paradiſe," he announced to all his followers the certainty of heavenly bliſs. He declared "the cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims" to be diſmiſſed, and the "flaming ſword" to be ſheathed, which had been appointed at the fall "to keep from man the way of the Tree of life." Faint, before this period, had been the hope, indiſtinct the proſpect, which even good men enjoyed of the heavenly kingdom. "Life and immortality were now brought to light." From the hill of Calvary, the firſt clear and certain view was given to the world of the everlaſting manſions. Since that hour, they have been the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual conſolation of believers in Chriſt. Under trouble, they ſoothe their minds; amidſt temptations they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port their virtue; and, in their dying moments, enable them to ſay, "O death! where is thy ſting? O grave! where is thy victory?"</p>

                  <head>I. SPEECH of the EARL of CHESTERFIELD, in the HOUSE of LORDS, FEB. 22. 1740, on the PENSION BILL.</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>MY LORDS,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>IT is now ſo late, and ſo much has been ſaid in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of the motion for the ſecond reading of the Penſion Bill, by Lords much abler than I am, that I ſhall detain you but a very ſhort while with what I have to ſay upon the ſubject. It has been ſaid by a Noble Duke, that this bill can be looked on only as a bill for preventing a grievance that is foreſeen, and not as a bill for remedying a grievance that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready felt; becauſe it is not aſſerted, nor ſo much as inſinuated in the preamble of the bill, that any corrupt practices are now made uſe of, for gaining an undue influence over the other Houſe. My Lords, this was the very reaſon for bringing in the bill. They could not aſſert, that any ſuch practices are now made uſe of, without a proof; and the means for coming at this proof, is what they want, and what they propoſe to get by this bill. They ſuſpect there are ſuch practices, but they cannot prove it. The crime is of ſuch a ſecret na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that it can very ſeldom be proved by witneſſes; and therefore they want to put it to the trial, at leaſt, of being proved by the oath of one of the parties; which is a method often taken in caſes that can admit of no other proof. This is, therefore, no argument of the grievance not being felt; for a man may, very ſenſibly, feel a grievance, and yet may not be able to prove it.</p>
                  <p>That there is a ſuſpicion of ſome ſuch practices be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now made uſe of, or that they will ſoon be made uſe of, the many remonſtrances from all parts of the united kingdoms are a ſufficient proof. That this ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion has crept into the other Houſe, their having ſo frequently ſent up this bill is a manifeſt demonſtration,
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:021451_0257_0FB3F7851CB98400"/>
and a ſtrong argument for its being neceſſary to have ſome ſuch bill paſſed into a law. The other houſe muſt be allowed to be better judges of what paſſes, or muſt paſs, within their own walls, than we can pretend to be. It is evident, they ſuſpect that corrupt practices have been, or ſoon may be, made uſe of, for gaining an undue influence over ſome of their meaſures; and they have calculated this bill for curing the evil if it is felt, for preventing it if it is only foreſeen. That any ſuch practices have been actually made uſe of, or are now made uſe of, is what I ſhall not pretend to affirm; but I am ſure I ſhall not affirm the contrary. If any ſuch are made uſe of, I will, with confidence, vindicate his Majeſty. I am ſure he knows nothing of them. I am ſure he will diſdain to ſuffer them: but I cannot paſs ſuch a compliment upon his miniſters, nor upon any ſet of miniſters that ever was, or ever will be, in this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and, therefore, I think I cannot more faithfully, more effectually, ſerve his preſent Majeſty, as well as his ſucceſſors, than by putting it out of the power of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to gain any corrupt influence over either Houſe of Parliament. Such an attempt may be neceſſary for the ſecurity of the miniſter, but never can be neceſſary, for it muſt always be inconſiſtent with the ſecurity of his Maſter: and the more neceſſary it is for the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's ſecurity, the more inconſiſtent it will always be with the King's, and the more dangerous to the liberties of the nation.</p>
                  <p>To pretend, my Lords, that this bill diminiſhes, or any way encroaches upon the prerogative, is ſomething very ſtrange. What prerogative, my Lords? Has the Crown a prerogative to bribe, to infringe the law, by ſending its penſioners into the other Houſe? To ſay ſo, is deſtroying the credit, the authority of the Crown, under the pretence of ſupporting its prerogative. If his Majeſty knew that any man received a penſion from him, or any thing like a penſion, and yet kept his ſeat in the other Houſe, he would himſelf declare it, or withdraw his penſion, becauſe he knows it is againſt law. This bill, therefore, no way diminiſhes or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaches upon the prerogatives of the Crown, which can never be exerciſed but for the public good. It dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:021451_0258_0FB3F7869E91CE40"/>
only the prerogatives uſurped by miniſters which are never exerciſed but for its deſtruction. The Crown may ſtill reward merit in the proper way, that is open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The bill is intended, and can operate only againſt clandeſtine rewards or gratuities given by miniſters. Theſe are ſcandalous, and never were, nor will be, given but for ſcandalous ſervices.</p>
                  <p>It is very remarkable, my Lords, it is even divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to ſee ſuch a ſqueamiſhneſs about perjury upon this occaſion, amongſt thoſe, who, upon other occaſions, have invented and enacted multitudes of oaths, to be taken by men who are under great temptations, from their private intereſt, to be guilty of perjury. Is not this the caſe of almoſt every oath that relates to the collection of the public revenue, or to the exerciſe of any office? Is not this perjury one of the chief objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made by the Diſſenters againſt the Teſt and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration Act? And ſhall we ſhow a leſs concern for the preſervation of our conſtitution, than for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our church? The reverend bench ſhould be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of making uſe of this argument; for if they will not allow us an oath for the preſervation of the former, it may induce many people to think they ought not to be allowed an oath for the preſervation of the latter.</p>
                  <p>By this time, I hope my Lords, all the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences pretended to ariſe from this bill have vaniſhed; and therefore I ſhall conſider ſome of the arguments brought to ſhow that it is not neceſſary. Here I muſt obſerve, that moſt of the arguments made uſe of for this purpoſe, are equally ſtrong for a repeal of the laws we have already in being againſt admitting penſioners to ſit and vote in the other Houſe. If it be impoſſible to ſuppoſe, that a gentleman of great eſtate and ancient family, can, by a penſion, be influenced to do what he ought not to do; and if we muſt ſuppoſe, that none but ſuch gentlemen can ever get into the other Houſe, I am ſure the laws for preventing penſioners from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſeats in that Houſe are quite unneceſſary, and ought to be repealed. Therefore, if theſe arguments prevail with your Lordſhips to put a negative upon the preſent queſtion, I ſhall expect to ſee that negative fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by a motion for the repeal of thoſe laws; nay, in
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:021451_0259_0FB3F7881E967D78"/>
a few ſeſſions, I ſhall expect to ſee a bill brought in for preventing any man's being a member of the other Houſe but ſuch as have ſome place or penſion under the Crown. As an argument for ſuch a bill, it might be ſaid, that his Majeſty's moſt faithful ſubjects ought to be choſen members of Parliament, and that thoſe gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen will always be moſt faithful to the King that receive the King's money. I ſhall grant, my Lords, that ſuch gentlemen will be always the moſt faithful, and the moſt obedient to the miniſter; but for this very reaſon, I ſhould be for excluding them from Parliament. The king's real intereſt, however much he may be made by his miniſters to miſtake it, muſt always be the ſame with the people's; but the miniſter's intereſt is generally diſtinct from, and often contrary to both: therefore I ſhall always be for excluding, as much as poſſible, from Parliament, every man who is under the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement to prefer the intereſt of the miniſter to that of both king and people: and this I take to be the caſe of every gentleman, let his eſtate and family be what they will, that holds a penſion at the will of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who ſay, they depend ſo much upon the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, integrity and impartiality of men of family and fortune, ſeem to think our conſtitution can never be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, as long as we have the ſhadow of a Parliament. My opinion, my Lord, is ſo very different, that if ever our conſtitution be diſſolved, if ever an abſolute mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy be eſtabliſhed in this kingdom, I am convinced it will be under that ſhadow. Our conſtitution conſiſts in the two Houſes of Parliament being a check upon the Crown, as well as upon one another. If that check ſhould ever be removed, if the Crown ſhould, by corrupt means, by places, penſions, and bribes, get the abſolute direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our two Houſes of Parliament, our conſtitution will, from that moment, be deſtroyed. There would be no occaſion for the Crown to proceed any farther. It would be ridiculous to lay aſide the forms of Parliament; for under that ſhadow our King would be more abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, and might govern more arbitrarily, than he could do without it. A gentleman of family and fortune, would not, perhaps, for the ſake of a penſion, agree to
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:021451_0260_0FB3F7899C352548"/>
lay aſide the forms of government; becauſe, by his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſervice there, he earns his infamous penſion, and could not expect the continuance of it if thoſe forms were laid aſide: but a gentleman of family and fortune may for the ſake of a penſion, whilſt he is in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, approve of the moſt blundering meaſures, conſent to the moſt exceſſive and uſeleſs grants, enact the moſt oppreſſive laws, paſs the moſt villainous accounts, acquit the moſt heinous criminals, and condemn the moſt inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent perſons at the deſire of that miniſter who pays him his penſion. And, if a majority of ſuch Houſe of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment conſiſted of ſuch men, would it not be ridiculous in us to talk of our conſtitution, or to ſay we had any liberty left?—This misfortune, this terrible condition, we may be reduced to by corruption: as brave, as free a people as we, the Romans, were reduced to it by the ſame means; and to prevent ſuch a horrid cataſtrophe, is the deſign of this bill.</p>
                  <p>If people would at all think, if they would conſider the conſequence of corruption, there would be no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, my Lords, for making laws againſt it. It would appear ſo horrible, that no man would allow it to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach him. The corrupted ought to conſider, that they do not ſell their vote, or their country only: theſe, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, they may diſregard; but they ſell like <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: they become the bond ſhaves of the corrupter, who corrupts them, not for their ſakes, but for his own. No man ever corrupted another for the ſake of doing him a ſervice. And, therefore, if people would but conſider, they would always reject the offer with diſdain. But this is not to be expected. The hiſtories of all countries, the hiſtory even of our own country, ſhows it is not to be depended on. The proffered bribe, people thinks will ſatisfy the immediate cravings of ſome infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous appetite; and this makes them ſwallow the allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring bait, though the liberties of their country, the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of their poſterity, and even their own liberty, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently depend upon their refuſing it. This makes it neceſſary, in every free ſtate, to contrive, if poſſible, effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual laws againſt corruption, and, as the laws we now have for excluding penſioners from the other Houſe, are allowed to be ineffectual, we ought to make a trial, at
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:021451_0261_0FB3F78B20062690"/>
eaſt, of the remedy now propoſed; for, though it ſhould prove ineffectual, it will be attended with this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, that it will put us upon contriving ſome other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy that may be effectual; and the ſooner ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy is contrived and applied, the leſs danger we ſhall be expoſed to of falling into that fatal diſtemper from which no free ſtate, where it has once become general, has ever yet recovered.</p>

                  <head>II. LORD MANSFIELD's SPEECH in the HOUSE of LORDS, 1770, on the BILL for the further preventing the delays of JUSTICE by reaſon of PRIVILEGE of PARLIAMENT.</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>MY LORDS,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>WHEN I conſider the importance of this bill to your Lordſhips, I am not ſurpriſed it has taken up ſo much of your conſideration. It is a bill, indeed, of no common magnitude; it is no leſs than to take away from two thirds of the legiſlative body of this great kingdom, certain privileges and immunities of which they have been long poſſeſſed. Perhaps there is no ſituation the human mind can be placed in, that is ſo difficult and ſo trying, as when it is made a judge in its own cauſe. There is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing implanted in the breaſt of man, ſo attached to ſelf, ſo tenacious of privileges once obtained, that, in ſuch a ſituation, either to diſcuſs, with impartiality, or decide with juſtice, has ever been held as the ſummit of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man virtue. The bill now in queſtion puts your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips in this very predicament; and I doubt not but the wiſdom of your deciſion will convince the world, that where ſelf-intereſt and juſtice are in oppoſite ſcales the latter will ever preponderate with your Lordſhips.</p>
                  <p>Privileges have been granted to legiſlators in all ages and in all countries. The practice is founded in wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: and, indeed, it is peculiarly eſſential to the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of this country, that the members of both Houſes ſhould be free in their perſons in caſes of civil ſuits; for there may come a time when the ſafety and welfare of this whole empire may depend upon their attendance in Parliament. God forbid that I ſhould adviſe any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that would in future endanger the ſtate: but the bill before your Lordſhips has, I am confident, no ſuch
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:021451_0262_0FB3F78C9C4CEB38"/>
tendency; for it expreſsly ſecures the perſons of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of either Houſe in all civil ſuits. This being the caſe, I confeſs, when I ſee many noble Lords, for whoſe judgment I have a very great reſpect, ſtanding up to oppoſe a bill which is calculated merely to facilitate the recovery of juſt and legal debts, I am aſtoniſhed and amazed. They, I doubt not, oppoſe the bill upon pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic principles: I would not wiſh to inſinuate, that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate intereſt had the leaſt weight in their determination.</p>
                  <p>This bill has been frequently propoſed, and as fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently miſcarried: but it was always loſt in the Lower Houſe. Little did I think, when it had paſſed the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, that it poſſibly could have met with ſuch oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition here. Shall it be ſaid, that you, my Lords, the grand council of the nation, the higheſt judicial and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative body of the realm, endeavor to evade by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege thoſe very laws which you enforce on your fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-ſubjects?—Forbid it juſtice!—I am ſure, were the noble Lords as well acquainted as I am with but half the difficulties and delays occaſioned in the courts of juſtice under pretence of privilege, they would not, nay they could not, oppoſe this bill.</p>
                  <p>I have waited with patience to hear what arguments might be urged againſt the bill, but I have waited in vain: the truth is, there is no argument that can weigh againſt it. The juſtice and expediency of the bill are ſuch as render it ſelf-evident. It is a propoſition of that nature, that can neither be weakened by argument, nor intangled with ſophiſtry. Much, indeed, has been ſaid by ſome noble Lords on the wiſdom of our ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, and how differently they thought from us. They not only decreed, that privilege ſhould prevent all civil ſuits from proceeding during the ſitting of parliament, but likewiſe granted protection to the very ſervants of members. I ſhall ſay nothing on the wiſdom of our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors; it might perhaps appear invidious: that is not neceſſary in the preſent caſe. I ſhall only ſay, that the noble Lords who flatter themſelves with the weight of that reflection, ſhould remember, that as circumſtances alter, things themſelves ſhould alter. Formerly, it was not ſo faſhionable either for maſters or ſervants to run in debt as it is at preſent. Formerly we were not that
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:021451_0263_0FB3F78E1F595848"/>
great commercial nation we are at preſent; nor former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were merchants and manufacturers members of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament as at preſent. The caſe now is very different: both merchants and manufacturers are, with great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, elected members of the Lower Houſe. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce having thus got into the legiſlative body of the kingdom, privilege muſt be done away. We all know, that the very ſoul and eſſence of trade are regular pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and ſad experience teaches us, that there are men, who will not make their regular payments with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the compulſive power of the laws. The law then ought to be equally open to all: any exemption to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular men, or particular ranks of men, is, in a free and commercial country, a ſoleciſm of the groſſeſt nature.</p>
                  <p>But I will not trouble your Lordſhips with arguments for that which is ſufficiently evident without any. I ſhall only ſay a few words to ſome noble Lords, who forſee much inconveniency from the perſons of their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants being liable to be arreſted. One noble Lord ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, That the coachman of a peer may be arreſted while he is driving his maſter to the Houſe, and, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, he will not be able to attend his duty in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. If this were actually to happen, there are ſo many methods by which the member might ſtill get to the Houſe, that I can hardly think the noble Lord is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in his objection. Another noble Peer ſaid, That by this bill one might loſe their moſt valuable and honeſt ſervants. This I hold to be a contradiction in terms: for he can neither be a valuable ſervant, nor an honeſt man who gets into debt which he is neither able nor willing to pay, till compelled by law. If my ſervant, by unforeſeen accidents, has got in debt, and I ſtill wiſh to retain him, I certainly would pay the debt. But upon no principle of liberal legiſlation whatever, can my ſervant have a title to ſet his creditors at defiance, while, for forty ſhillings only, the honeſt tradeſman may be torn from his family and looked up in a gaol. It is mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruous injuſtice! I flatter myſelf, however, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of this day will entirely put an end to all ſuch partial proceedings for the future, by paſſing into a law the bill now under your Lordſhips conſideration.</p>
                  <p>I come now to ſpeak, upon what, indeed, I would have
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:021451_0264_0FB3F78FA028A2B0"/>
gladly avoided, had I not been particularly pointed at for the part I have taken in this bill. It has been ſaid by a noble Lord on my left hand, that I likewiſe am running the race of popularity. If the noble Lord means by popularity, that applauſe beſtowed by after ages on good and virtuous actions, I have long been ſtruggling in that race; to what purpoſe, all trying time can alone determine: but if the noble Lord means that muſhroom popularity that is raiſed without merit and loſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a crime, he is much miſtaken in his opinion. I defy the noble Lord to-point out a ſingle action of my life, where the popularity of the times ever had the ſmalleſt influence on my determinations. I thank God I have a more permanent and ſteady rule for my conduct,—the dictates of my own breaſt. Thoſe that have forgone that pleaſing adviſer, and given up their mind to the ſlave of every popular impulſe, I ſincerely pity: I pity them ſtill more, if their vanity leads them to miſtake the ſhouts of a mob for the trumpet of fame. Experience might inform them, that many who have been ſaluted with the huzzas of a crowd one day, have received their execrations the next; and many, who, by the popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their times, have been held up as ſpotleſs pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots, have, nevertheleſs, appeared upon the hiſtorian's page, when truth has triumphed over deluſion, the aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins of liberty. Why then the noble Lord can think I am ambitious of preſent popularity, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cho of folly, and ſhadow of renown, I am at a loſs to determine. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, I do not know that the bill now before your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips will be popular; it depends much upon the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>price of the day. It may not be popular to compel peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to pay their debts; and, in that caſe, the preſent muſt be a very unpopular bill. It may not be popular nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to take away any of the privileges of Parliament: for I very well remember, and many of your Lordſhips may remember, that not long ago the popular cry was for the extenſion of privilege; and ſo far did they carry it at that time, that it was ſaid that the privilege pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected members even in criminal actions; nay, ſuch was the power of popular prejudices over weak minds, that the very deciſions of ſome of the courts were tinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured with that doctrine. It was undoubtedly an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:021451_0265_0FB3F7911EDD4A78"/>
doctrine; I thought ſo then and think ſo ſtill: but, nevertheleſs, it was a popular doctrine; and came immediately from thoſe who are called the friends of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; how deſervedly time will ſhow. True liberty, in my opinion, can only exiſt when juſtice is equally admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtered to all; to the king, and to the beggar. Where is the juſtice then, or where is the law, that protects a member of parliament more than any other man, from the puniſhment due to his crimes? The laws of this country allow of no place, nor no employment, to be a ſanctuary for crimes; and where I have the honor to ſit as judge, neither royal favor nor popular applauſe ſhall ever protect the guilty.</p>
                  <p>I have now only to beg pardon for having employed ſo much of your Lordſhips time; and I am ſorry a bill, fraught with ſo many good conſequences, has not met with an abler advocate: but I doubt not your Lordſhips determination will convince the world, that a bill calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to contribute ſo much to the equal diſtribution of juſtice as the preſent, requires with your Lordſhips but very little ſupport.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE been charged with giving birth to ſedition in America. Sorry I am to hear the liberty of ſpeech in this Houſe, imputed as a crime. But the imputation ſhall not diſcourage me. It is a liberty I mean to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe. No gentleman ought to be afraid to exerciſe it. It is a liberty by which the gentleman (Mr. Grenville) who calumm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Three mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of people, ſo dead to all the feelings of liberty, as voluntarily to ſubmit to be ſlaves, would have been fit inſtruments to make ſlav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s of the reſt. I come not here armed at all points, with law caſes and acts of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with the ſtatute-book doubled down in dog-ears, to defend the cauſe of liberty: if I had, I myſelf would have cited the two caſes of Cheſter and Durham. I would have cited them to have ſhown, that even under
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:021451_0266_0FB3F7929BA83340"/>
any arbitrary reigns, parliaments were aſhamed of tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a people without their conſent, and allowed them repreſentatives. Why did the gentleman confine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to Cheſter and Durham? He might have taken a higher example in Wales; Wales that never was taxed by Parliament till it was incorporated. I would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate a particular point of law with the gentleman: I know his abilities. I have been obliged to his diligent reſearches. But, for the defence of liberty upon a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral principle, upon a conſtitutional principle, it is a ground on which I ſtand firm; on which I dare meet any man. The gentleman tells us of many that are tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and are not repreſented. The India Company, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, ſtock-holders, manufacturers. Surely many of theſe are repreſented in other capacities, as owners of land, or as freemen of boroughs. It is a misfortune that more are not actually repreſented. But they are all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, and, as ſuch, are virtually repreſented. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have it in their option to be actually repreſented. They have connections with thoſe that elect, and they have influence over them.</p>
                  <p>When I had the honor to ſerve his Majeſty, there were not wanting ſome, to propoſe to me to burn my fingers with an American ſtamp-act. With the enemy at their back, with our bayonets at their breaſts, in the day of their diſtreſs, perhaps the Americans would have ſubmited to the impoſition; but it would have been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an ungenerous and unjuſt advantage. The gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man boaſts of his bounties to America! Are not theſe bounties intended finally for the benefit of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom? If they are not, he has miſapplied the national treaſures. I am no courtier of America; I ſtand up for this kingdom: I maintain that the Parliament has a right to bind, to reſtrain America. Our legiſlative power over America is ſovereign and ſupreme. When it ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to be ſovereign and ſupreme, I would adviſe every gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman to ſell his lands, if he can, and embark for that country. When two countries are connected together, like England and her colonies, without being incorporat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the one muſt neceſſarily govern; the greater muſt rule the leſs; but ſo rule it, as not to contradict the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental principles that are common to both.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="268" facs="unknown:021451_0267_0FB3F7941F149AA0"/>If the gentleman does not underſtand the difference between internal and external taxes, I cannot help it; but there is a plain diſtinction between taxes levied for the purpoſes of raiſing a revenue, and duties impoſed for the regulation of trade, for the accommodation of the ſubject; although, in the conſequences, ſome revenue might incidentally ariſe from the latter.</p>
                  <p>The gentleman aſks, when were the colonies emanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated? But I deſire to know, when they were made ſlaves? But I dwell not upon words. When I had the honor of ſerving his Majeſty, I availed myſelf of the means of information which I derived from my office: I ſpeak, therefore, from knowledge. My materials were good. I was at pains to collect, to digeſt, to conſider them; and I will be bold to affirm, that the profits to Great Britain from the trade of the colonies, through all its branches, is two millions a-year. This is the fund that carried you triumphantly through the laſt war. The eſtates that were rented at two thouſand pounds a year, threeſcore years ago, are at three thouſand pounds at preſent. Thoſe eſtates ſold them from fifteen to eighteen years purchaſe; the ſame may be now ſold for thirty. You owe this to America. This is the price that America pays you for her protection. And ſhall a miſerable financier come with a boaſt, that he can fetch a pepper-corn into the exchequer, to the loſs of millions to the nations? I dare not ſay how much high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er theſe profits may be augmented. Omitting the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe increaſe of people by natural propagation in the northern-colonies, and the migration from every part of Europe, I am convinced the whole commercial ſyſtem of America may be altered to advantage. You have prohibited where you ought to have encouraged, and you have encouraged where you ought to have prohibited. Improper reſtraints have been laid on the continent in favor of the iſlands. Much is wrong, much may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for the general good of the whole.</p>
                  <p>A great deal has been ſaid out of doors of the power, of the ſtrength of America. It is a topic that ought to be ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

know the ſkill of your officers. There is not a company of foot that has ſerved in America, out of which you may not pick a man of ſufficient knowledge and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to make a governor of a colony there. But, on this ground, on the ſtamp-act, when ſo many here will think it a crying injuſtice, I am one who will lift up my hands againſt it.</p>
                  <p>In ſuch a cauſe your ſucceſs would be hazardous.— America, if ſhe fell, would fall like a ſtrong man. She would embrace the pillars of the ſtate, and pull down the conſtitution along with her.

But the wide ruin that the counſels of adminiſtration have ſpread through this great empire, and the miſerable ſtate to which they have reduced it in the ſhort ſpace in which the preſent Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament have been ſitting, is ſo far beyond the natural effects of mere ignorance, that I cannot help adopting the opinion of an honorable friend, that there is treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery at the bottom of the national councils. His Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip (Lord North) may flatter himſelf as much as he pleaſes in the protection of a majority, or in the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the law; but, when a nation is reduced to ſuch a ſtate of wretchedneſs and diſtraction that the laws can afford the people no relief, they will give a miniſter who has cauſed the evil but little protection.

But the plaintiffs, who have been defrauded of a very large ſum of money, and cruelly injured by one who ought to have been the laſt to hurt them; have applied to me, as a relation, to plead their cauſe, and procure them redreſs. And I thought I could not decently excuſe myſelf from undertaking the patronage of perſons in ſuch diſtreſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>When the plaintiffs intreated me, as they did often, to undertake the management of the ſuit, I adviſed them to refer the difference, between them and their uncle the defendant, to private arbitration; thinking it the intereſt of both parties to conceal, as much as poſſible, from the knowledge of the public, that there was any diſpute between them. But, as Diogiton knew that it was eaſy to prove him guilty of detaining the property of the plaintiffs his nephews, he foreſaw, that it would by no means anſwer his purpoſe to ſubmit his cauſe to the deciſion of arbitrators. He has, therefore, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined

                  <p>I moſt humbly implore you, venerable judges, to grant the plaintiffs redreſs, if I ſhow you, as I hope I ſhall in the moſt ſatisfactory manner, that the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, though ſo nearly related to the unhappy orphans the plaintiffs, has treated them in ſuch a manner, as would be ſhameful among abſolute ſtrangers.</p>
                  <p>I beg leave to lay before you, venerable judges, the ſubject of the preſent proſecution, as follows:</p>
                  <p>Diodotus and Diogition were brothers, the children of the ſame father and the ſome mother. Upon their father's deceaſe, they divided between them his move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables; but his real eſtate they enjoyed conjunctly. Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus growing rich, Diogition offered him his only daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in marriage. By her Diodotus had two ſons and a daughter. Diodotus happening afterwards to be enrolled, in his turn, to go to the war under Thraſyllus, he call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together his wife, his brother's daughter, his wife's brother, and his own brother, who was likewiſe his father-in-law, and both uncle and grandfather to his children. He thought he could not truſt the care of his children in properer hands than thoſe of his brother. He leaves in his cuſtody, his will, with five talents of ſilver. He gives him an account of ſeven talents, and forty minae beſides, which were out at intereſt, and a thouſand minae, which were due to him by a perſon in the Cherſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſus. He had ordered in his will, that, in caſe of his death, one talent, and the houſehold-furniture, ſhould be his wife's. He bequeathed farther, to his daughter, one talent, and twenty minae, and thirty Cyzicenian ſtaterers, and the reſt of his eſtate equally between his ſons. Settling his affairs thus, and leaving a copy of his will, he ſets out along with the army. He dies at Epheſus. Diogition conceals from his daughter the death of her huſband. He gets into his hands the will of his deceaſed brother, by pretending that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for him to ſhow it as a voucher, in order to his tranſacting ſome affairs for his brother during his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. At length, when he thought the deceaſe of his brother could not much longer be concealed, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally declares it. The family go into mourning.
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:021451_0273_0FB3F79D1C50EAA8"/>
They ſtay one year at Piraeum, where their moveables were. In this time the produce of all that could be ſold of the effects being ſpent, he ſends the children to town, and gives his daughter, the widow of his brother Diodotus, to a ſecond huſband, and with her five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand drachmae, of which the huſband returns him one thouſand as a preſent. When the eldeſt ſon came to man's eſtate, about eight years after the departure of Diodotus, Diogiton calls the children together; tells them, that their father had left them twenty minae of ſilver, and thirty ſtaterers. "I have laid out (ſays he) of my own money, for your maintenance and education, a conſiderable ſum. Nor did I grudge it, while I was in flouriſhing circumſtances, and could afford it. But, by unforeſeen and irremediable misfortunes, I am redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to an incapacity of continuing my kindneſs to you. Therefore as you (ſpeaking to the eldeſt ſon) are now of an age to ſhift for yourſelf, I would adviſe you to reſolve upon ſome employment, by which you may gain a ſubſiſtence."</p>
                  <p>The poor fatherleſs children were thunderſtruck upon hearing this barbarous ſpeech. They fled in tears to their mother, and, with her, came to requeſt my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. Finding themſelves ſtripped of the eſtate left them by their father, and reduced by their hard-hearted uncle and grandfather to abſolute beggary, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated that I would not deſert them too: but, for the ſake of their ſiſter, my wife, would undertake their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. The mother begged that I would bring about a meeting of the relations, to reaſon the matter with her father; and ſaid, that though ſhe had never before ſpoke in any large company, eſpecially of men, ſhe would endeavor to lay before them the diſtreſſes and injuries of her family.</p>
                  <p>Diogiton being, with difficulty, brought to the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the mother of the plaintiffs aſked him, how he could have the heart to uſe her ſons in ſuch a manner? "Are you not, Sir (ſays ſhe,) the uncle and the grandfather of the two fatherleſs youths? Are they not the children of your own brother and of your own daughter? How could they be more nearly related to you, unleſs they were your own ſons? And, though
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:021451_0274_0FB3F79E9D73BBE0"/>
you deſpiſed all human authority, you ought to reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence the gods, who are witneſſes of the truſt repoſed in you by the deceaſed father of the unhappy youths."</p>
                  <p>She then enumerated the ſeveral ſums, the property of the deceaſed, which had been received by Diogiton, and charged him with them, producing authentic evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of every particular. "You have driven (ſays ſhe) out of their own houſe, the children of your own daughter, in rags, unfurniſhed with the common de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencies of life. You have deprived them of the effects, and of the money left them by their father. But you want to enrich the children you have had by my ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother; which, without doubt, you might lawfully and properly do, if it were not at the expence and to the utter ruin of thoſe whoſe fortunes were depoſited in your hands, and whom, from affluence, you want to reduce to beggary; impiouſly deſpiſing the authority of the gods, injuring your own daughter, and violating the ſacred will of the dead."</p>
                  <p>The diſtreſſed mother having vented her grief in ſuch bitter complaints as theſe, we were all, by ſympathy, ſo touched with her afflictions, and the cruelty of her injurious father, that, when we conſidered in our own minds the hard uſage which the young innocents had met with, when we remembered the deceaſed Diodotus, and thought how unworthy a guardian he had choſen for his children, there was not one of us who could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain from tears. And I perſuade myſelf, venerable judges, that you will not be unaffected with ſo calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous a caſe, when you come to conſider attentively the various aggravations of the defendant's proceedings. Such unfaithfulneſs, in ſo ſolemn a truſt, were it to paſs unpuniſhed, and conſequently to become common, would deſtroy all confidence among mankind; ſo that nobody would know how, or to whom, he could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the management of his affairs in his abſence or after his death.</p>
                  <p>The defendant, at firſt, would have denied his having had any effects of his brother's left in his hands; and when he found he could not get off that way, he then produced an account of ſums laid out, as he pretended, by him for the children, to ſuch a value as is beyond all
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:021451_0275_0FB3F7A021CB8510"/>
belief; no leſs than ſeven talents of ſilver and ſeven thouſand drachmae. All this, he ſaid, had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended in eight years, in the clothing and maintenance of two boys and a girl.</p>
                  <p>Had the defendant been a man of any principle, he would have bethought himſelf of laying out to advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage the fortune left in his hands by the deceaſed, for the benefit of the fatherleſs children. Had he bought with it lands or houſes, the children might have been maintained out of the yearly rents, and the principal have been kept entire. But he does not ſeem to have once thought of improving their fortune; but, on the contrary, to have contrived only how to ſtrip them.</p>
                  <p>But the moſt atrocious (for a ſingle action) of all his proceedings, is what follows.

                  <p>To paſs over the ſhameful irregularities of his youth, what does his quaeſtorſhip, the firſt public employment he held, what does it exhibit, but one continued ſcene of villanies? Cneius Carbo plundered of the public money by his own treaſurer, a conſul ſtripped and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed, an army deſerted and reduced to want, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince robbed, the civil and religious rights of a people violated. The employment he held in Aſia Minor and Pamphylia, what did it produce but the ruin of thoſe countries? in which houſes, cities, and temples, were robbed by him. What was his conduct in his praetor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip here at home? Let the plundered temples, and public works neglected that he might embezzle the money intended for carrying them on, bear witneſs. How did he diſcharge the office of a judge? Let thoſe who ſuffered by his injuſtice anſwer. But his praetor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in Sicily crowns all his works of wickedneſs, and finiſhes a laſting monument to his infamy.

His nod has decided all cauſes in Sicily for theſe three years. And his deciſions have broke all law, all precedent, all right. The ſums he has, by arbitrary taxes and unheard of impoſitions, extorted from the induſtrious poor, are not to be computed. The moſt faithful allies of the commonwealth have been treated as enemies. Roman citizens have, like ſlaves, been put to death with tortures. The moſt atrocious criminals, for money, have been exempted from the deſerved pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments;

and men of the moſt unexceptionable cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters condemned and baniſhed unheard. The har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, though ſufficiently fortified, and the gates of ſtrong towns, opened to pirates and ravagers. The ſoldiery and ſailors, belonging to a province under the protection of the commonwealth, ſtarved to death. Whole fleets, to the great detriment of the province. ſuffered to periſh. The ancient monuments of either Sicilian or Roman greatneſs, the ſtatues of heroes and princes, carried off; and the temples ſtripped of the images. Having, by his iniquitous ſentences, filled the priſons with the moſt induſtrious and deſerving of the people, he then proceeded to order numbers of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man citizens to be ſtrangled in the goals; ſo that the exclamation, "I am a citizen of Rome!" which has often, in the moſt diſtant regions, and among the moſt barbarous people, been a protection, was of no ſervice to them; but, on the contrary, brought a ſpeedier and more ſevere puniſhment upon them.</p>
                  <p>I aſk now, Verres, what you have to advance againſt this charge? Will you pretend to deny it? Will you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that any thing falſe, that even any thing aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is alleged againſt you? Had any prince, or any ſtate, committed the ſame outrage againſt the privilege of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man citizens, ſhould we not think we had ſufficient ground for declaring immediate war againſt them? What pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment ought, then, to be inflicted upon a tyrannical and wicked praetor, who dared, at no greater diſtance than Sicily, within ſight of the Italian coaſt, to put to the infamous death of crucifixion that unfortunate and innocent citizen Publius Gavius Coſanus, only for his having aſſerted his privilege of citizenſhip, and declared his intention of appealing to the juſtice of his country againſt a cruel oppreſſor, who had unjuſtly confined him in priſon at Syracuſe, whence he had juſt made his eſcape? The unhappy man, arreſted as he was going to embark for his native country, is brought before the wicked praetor. With eyes darting fury, and a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance diſtorted with cruelty, he orders the helpleſs victim of his rage to be ſtripped, and rods to be brought; accuſing him, but without the leaſt ſhadow of evidence, or even of ſuſpicions of having come to Sicily as a ſpy.

It was in vain that the unhappy man cried out, "I am a Roman citizen: I have ſerved under Lucius Pretius, who is now at Panormus, and will atteſt my innocence." The blood-thirſty p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus, Fathers, was an innocent Roman citizen publicly mangled with ſcourging; whilſt the only words he uttered amidſt his cruel ſufferings were, "I am a Roman citizen!" With theſe he hoped to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himſelf from violence and infamy. But of ſo little ſervice was this privilege to him, that while he was thus aſſerting his citizenſhip, the order was given for his execution—for his execution upon the croſs!—</p>
                  <p>O liberty!—O ſound once delightful to every Roman ear!—O ſacred privilege of Roman citizenſhip!—once ſacred!—now trampled upon!—But what then! Is it come to this? Shall an inferior magiſtrate, a governor, who holds his whole power of the Roman people, in a Roman province, within ſight of Italy, bind, ſcourge, torture with fire and red-hot plates of iron, and at laſt put to the infamous death of the croſs, a Roman citizen? Shall neither the cries of innocence expiring in agony, nor the tears of pitying ſpectators, nor the majeſty of the Roman commonwealth, nor the fear of the juſtice of his country, reſtrain the licentious and wanton cruelty of a monſter, who, in confidence of his riches, ſtrikes at the root of liberty, and ſets mankind at de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance?</p>
                  <p>I conclude with expreſſing my hopes, that your wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and juſtice, Fathers, will not, by ſuffering the atrocious and unexampled inſolence of Caius Verres to eſcape the due puniſhment, leave room to apprehend the danger of a total ſubverſion of authority, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction of general anarchy and confuſion.</p>

                  <p>THAT you may be able the more eaſily to determine upon this point before you, I ſhall beg the favor of an attentive hearing, while in a few words I lay open the whole affair.—Clodius being determined, when crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted praetor, to haraſs his country with every ſpecies of
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:021451_0280_0FB3F7A79CAFAC78"/>
oppreſſion, and finding the comitia had been delayed ſo long the year before, that he could not hold this office many months, all on a ſudden threw up his own year, and reſerved himſelf to the next; not from any religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſcruple, but that he might have, as he ſaid himſelf, a full entire year for exerciſing his praetorſhip; that is, for overturning the commonwealth. Being ſenſible he muſt be controled and cramped in the exerciſe of his praetorian authority under Milo, who, he plainly ſaw, would be choſen conſul by the unanimous conſent of the Roman people; he joined the candidates that oppoſed Milo, but in ſuch a manner that he overruled them in every thing, had the ſole management of the election, and, as he uſed often to boaſt, bore all the comitia up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own ſhoulders. He aſſembled the tribes; he thruſt himſelf into their counſels, and formed a new tribe of the moſt abandoned of the citizens. The more confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and diſturbance he made, the more Milo prevailed. When this wretch, who was bent upon all manner of wickedneſs, ſaw that ſo brave a man, and his moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate enemy, would certainly be conſul; when he perceived this, not only by the diſcourſes, but by the votes of the Roman people, he began to throw of all diſguiſe, and to declare openly that Milo muſt be kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He often intimated this in the ſenate, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it expreſsly before the people; inſomuch that when Favonius, that brave man, aſked him what proſpect he could have of carrying on his furious deſigns, while Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo was alive? he replied, that in three or four days at moſt he ſhould be taken out of the way: which reply Favonius immediately communicated to Cato.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, as ſoon as Clodius knew, (nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was there any difficulty to come at the intelligence) that Milo was obliged by the 18th of January to be at Lanuvium, where he was dictator, in order to nominate a prieſt, a duty which the laws rendered neceſſary to be performed every year; he went ſuddenly from Rome the day before, in order, as appears by the event, to way-lay Milo in his own grounds; and this at a time when he was obliged to leave a tumultuous aſſembly, which he had ſummoned that very day, where his preſence was neceſſary to carry on his mad deſigns; a thing he never
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:021451_0281_0FB3F7A91E4A2680"/>
would have done, if he had not been deſirous to take the advantage of that particular time and place for perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating his villany. But Milo, after having ſtaid in the ſenate that day till the houſe was broke up, went home, changed his cloaths, waited a while, as uſual, till his wife had got ready to attend him, and then ſet forward about the time that Clodius, if he had propoſed to come back to Rome that day, might have returned. He meets Clodius near his own eſtate, a little before ſun-ſet, and is immediately attacked by a body of men, who throw their darts at him from an eminence, and kill his coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Upon which he threw off his cloak, leaped from his chariot, and defended himſelf with great bravery. In the mean time Clodius's attendants drawing their ſwords, ſome of them ran back to the chariot in order to attack Milo in the rear; whilſt others, thinking that he was already killed, fell upon his ſervants who were behind: theſe being reſolute and faithful to their maſter, were, ſome of them, ſlain; whilſt the reſt, ſeeing a warm en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement near the chariot, being prevented from going to their maſter's aſſiſtance, hearing beſides from Clodius himſelf that Milo was killed, and believing it to be fact, acted upon this occaſion (I mention it, not with a view to elude the accuſation, but becauſe it was the true ſtate of the caſe) without the orders, without the knowledge, without the preſence of their maſter, as every man would wiſh his own ſervants ſhould act in the like cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.</p>
                  <p>This, my Lords, is a faithful account of the matter of fact: the perſon who lay in wait was himſelf over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and force ſubdued by force, or rather audaciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs chaſtiſed by true valor. I ſay nothing of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage which accrues to the ſtate in general, to your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in particular, and to all good men; I am content to wave the argument I might draw from hence in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of my client, whoſe deſtiny was ſo peculiar, that he could not ſecure his own ſafety, without ſecuring yours and that of the republic at the ſame time. If he could not do it lawfully, there is no room for attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his defence. But, if reaſon teaches the learned, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity the barbarian, common cuſtom all nations in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and even nature itſelf inſtructs the brutes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:021451_0282_0FB3F7AAA3F717A0"/>
their bodies, limbs, and lives when attacked, by all poſſible methods, you cannot pronounce this action cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, without determining at the ſame time, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever falls into the hands of a highwayman, muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity periſh either by the ſword or your deciſions. Had Milo been of this opinion, he would certainly have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to have fallen by the hand of Clodius, who had more than once before this made an attempt upon his life, rather than be executed by your order, becauſe he had not tamely yielded himſelf a victim to his rage. But if none of you are of this opinion, the proper queſtion is, not whether Clodius was killed; for that we grant: but whether juſtly or unjuſtly? If it appear that Milo was the aggreſſor, we aſk no favor; but if Clodius, you will then acquit him of the crime that has been laid to his charge.</p>
                  <p>What method then can we take to prove that Clodius lay in wait for Milo? It is ſufficient, conſidering what an audacious abandoned wretch he was, to ſhow that he lay under a ſtrong temptation to it, that he formed great hopes, and propoſed to himſelf great advantages from Milo's death. By Milo's death, Clodius would not only have gained his point of being praetor, without that reſtraint which his adverſary's power as conſul would have laid upon his wicked deſigns, but likewiſe that of being praetor under thoſe conſuls, by whoſe connivance at leaſt, if not aſſiſtance, he hoped he ſhould be able to betray the ſtate into the mad ſchemes he had been form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; perſuading himſelf, that as they thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under ſo great an obligation to him, they would have no inclination to oppoſe any of his attempts, even if they ſhould have it in their power; and that, if they were inclined to do it, they would perhaps be ſcarce able to control the moſt profligate of all men, who had been confirmed and hardened in his audaciouſneſs by a long ſeries of villanies.</p>
                  <p>Milo is ſo far from receiving any benefit from Clodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us's death, that he is really a ſufferer by it. But it may be ſaid that hatred prevailed, that anger and reſentment urged him on, that he avenged his own wrongs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed his own grievances. Now if all theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars may be applied not merely with greater propriety
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:021451_0283_0FB3F7AC1D88E1F0"/>
to Clodius than to Milo, but with the utmoſt propriety to the one, and not the leaſt to the other; what more can you deſire? For why ſhould Milo bear any other hatred to Clodius, who furniſhed him with ſuch a rich harveſt of glory, but that which every patriot muſt bear to all bad men? As to Clodius, he had motives enough for bearing ill-will to Milo; firſt, as my protector and guardian; then as the oppoſer of his mad ſchemes, and the controller of his armed force; and laſtly, as his accuſer.</p>
                  <p>Every circumſtance, my Lords, concurs to prove that it was for Milo's intereſt Clodius ſhould live; that, on the contrary, Milo's death was a moſt deſirable event for anſwering the purpoſes of Clodius; that on the one ſide there was a moſt implacable hatred, on the other not the leaſt; that the one had been continually employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf in acts of violence, the other only in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them; that the life of Milo was threatened, and his death publicly foretold by Clodius, whereas nothing of that kind was ever heard from Milo; that the day fixed for Milo's journey was well known to his adverſary, while Milo knew not when Clodius was to return; that Milo's journey was neceſſary, but that of Clodius rather the contrary; that the one openly declared his intention of leaving Rome that day, while the other co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed his intention of returning; that Milo made no al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in his meaſures, but that Clodius feigned an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for altering his; that if Milo had deſigned to way-lay Clodius, he would have waited for him near the city till it was dark, but that Clodius, even if he had been under no apprehenſions from Milo, ought to have been afraid of coming to town ſo late at night.</p>
                  <p>Let us now conſider whether the place where they encountered was moſt favourable to Milo or to Clodius. But can there, my Lords, be any room for doubt, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation upon that? It was near the eſtate of Clodius, where at leaſt a thouſand able-bodied men were employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his mad ſchemes of building. Did Milo think he ſhould have an advantage by attacking him from an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence, and did he for this reaſon pitch upon that ſpot for the engagement; or was he not rather expected in that place by his adverſary, who hoped the ſituation
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:021451_0284_0FB3F7AD9F06E2E8"/>
would favor his aſſault? The thing, my Lords, ſpeaks for itſelf, which muſt be allowed to be of the greateſt importance in determining a queſtion. Were the affair to be repreſented only by painting, inſtead of being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by words, it would even then clearly appear which was the traitor, and which was free from all miſchievous deſigns; when the one was ſitting in his chariot muffled up in his cloak, and his wife along with him. Which of theſe circumſtances was not a very great incumbrance? the dreſs, the chariot, or the companion? How could he be worſe equipped for an engagement, when he was wrapt up in a cloak, embarraſſed with a chariot, and almoſt fettered by his wife? Obſerve the other now, in the firſt place, ſallying out on a ſudden from his ſeat; for what reaſon? in the evening; what urged him? late; to what purpoſe, eſpecially at that ſeaſon? He calls at Pompey's ſeat; with what view? To ſee Pompey? He knew he was at Alſium. To ſee his houſe? He had been in it a thouſand times. What then could be the reaſon of this loitering and ſhifting about? He wanted to be upon the ſpot when Milo came up.</p>
                  <p>But if, my Lords, you are not yet convinced, though the thing ſhines out with ſuch ſtrong and full evidence, that Milo returned to Rome with an innocent mind, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained with guilt, undiſturbed by fear, and free from the accuſations of conſcience; call to mind, I beſeech you by the immortal gods, the expedition with which he came back, his entrance into the forum while the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate-houſe was in flames, the greatneſs of ſoul he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, the look he aſſumed, the ſpeech he made on the occaſion. He delivered himſelf up, not only to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but even to the ſenate; nor to the ſenate alone, but even to guards appointed for the public ſecurity; nor merely to them, but even to the authority of him whom the ſenate had intruſted with the care of the whole republic: to whom he would never have deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf, if he had not been confident of the goodneſs of his cauſe.</p>
                  <p>What now remains, but to beſeech and adjure you, my Lords, to extend that compaſſion to a brave man, which he diſdains to implore, but which I, even againſt his conſent, implore and earneſtly intreat. Though you
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:021451_0285_0FB3F7AF1C9BAF48"/>
have not ſeen him ſhed a ſingle tear while all are weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing around him, though he has preſerved the ſame ſteady countenance, the ſame firmneſs of voice and language, do not on this account withhold it from him.</p>
                  <p>On you, on you I call, ye heroes, who have loſt ſo much blood in the ſervice of your country! to you, ye centurions, ye ſoldiers, I appeal in this hour of danger to the beſt of men, and braveſt of citizens! while you are looking on, while you ſtand here with arms in your hands, and guard this tribunal, ſhall virtue like this be expelled, exterminated, caſt out with diſhonor? By the immortal gods I wiſh (pardon me, O my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try! for I fear what I ſhall ſay out of a pious regard for Milo may be deemed impiety againſt thee,) that Clodius not only lived, but were praetor, conſul, dictator, rather than be witneſs to ſuch a ſcene as this. Shall this man, then, who was born to ſave his country, die any where but in his country? Shall he not at leaſt die in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his country? Will you retain the memorials of his gallant ſoul, and deny his body a grave in Italy? Will any perſon give his voice for baniſhing a man from this city, whom every city on earth would be proud to receive within its walls? Happy the country that ſhall receive him! ungrateful this, if it ſhall baniſh him! wretched, if it ſhould loſe him! But I muſt conclude; my tears will not allow me to proceed, and Milo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids tears to be employed in his defence. You, my Lords, I beſeech and adjure, that, in your deciſion you would dare to act as you think. Truſt me, your forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, your juſtice, your fidelity, will more eſpecially be approved of by him (Pompey,) who in his choice of judges has raiſed to the bench the braveſt, the wiſeſt, and the beſt of men.</p>

                  <head>I. CAIUS MARIUS to the ROMANS; ſhowing the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity of their heſitating to confer on him the RANK of GENERAL merely on ACCOUNT of his EXTRACTION.</head>
                  <p>IT is but too common, my Countrymen, to obſerve a material difference between the behavior of thoſe who ſtand candidates for places of power and truſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after their obtaining them. They ſolicit them in one manner, and execute them in another. They ſet out with a great appearance of activity, humility, and moderation; and they quickly fall into ſloth, pride, and avarice.—It is, undoubtedly, no eaſy matter to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, to the general ſatisfaction, the duty of a ſupreme commander in troubleſome times. To carry on, with effect, an expenſive war, and yet be frugal of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic money; to oblige thoſe to ſerve, whom it may be delicate to offend; to conduct, at the ſame time, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated variety of operations; to concert meaſures at home, anſwerable to the ſtate of things abroad; and to gain every valuable end, in ſpite of oppoſition from the envious, the factious, and the diſaffected—to do all this, my countrymen, is more difficult than is generally thought.</p>
                  <p>But, beſides the diſadvantages which are common to me with all others in eminent ſtations, my caſe is, in this reſpect, peculiarly hard—that, whereas a command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Patrician rank, if he is guilty of a neglect or breach of duty, has his great connections, the antiquity of his family, the important ſervices of his anceſtors, and the multitudes he has, by power, engaged in his intereſt, to ſcreen him from condign puniſhment, my whole ſafety depends upon myſelf; which renders it the more indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſably neceſſary for me to take care that my conduct be
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:021451_0287_0FB3F7B21EEF8A58"/>
clear and unexceptionable. Beſides, I am well aware, my Countrymen, that the eye of the public is upon me; and that, though the impartial, who prefer the real ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the commonwealth to all other conſiderations, favor my pretenſions, the Partricians want nothing ſo much as an occaſion againſt me. It is, therefore, my fixed reſolution, to uſe my beſt endeavors, that you be not diſappointed in me, and that their indirect deſigns againſt me may be defeated.</p>
                  <p>I have, from my youth, been familiar with toils and with dangers. I was faithful to your intereſt, my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, when I ſerved you for no reward but that of honor. It is not my deſign to betray you, now that you have conferred upon me a place of profit. You have committed to my conduct the war againſt Jugur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha. The Patricians are offended at this. But, where would be the wiſdom of giving ſuch a command to one of their honorable body? a perſon of illuſtrious birth, of ancient family, of innumerable ſtatues, but—of no experience! What ſervice would his long line of dead anceſtors, or his multitude of motionleſs ſtatues, do his country in the day of battle? What could ſuch a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral do, but, in his trepidation and inexperience, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to ſome inferior commander for direction in diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties to which he was not himſelf equal? Thus, your Patrician general would in fact have a general over him; ſo that the acting commander would ſtill be a Plebeian. So true is this, my Countrymen, that I have, myſelf, known thoſe who have been choſen conſuls, begin then to read the hiſtory of their own country, of which, till that time, they were totally ignorant; that is, they firſt obtained the employment, and then bethought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the qualifications neceſſary for the proper diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of it.</p>
                  <p>I ſubmit to your judgment, Romans, on which ſide the advantage lies, when a compariſon is made between Patrician haughtineſs and Plebeian experience. The very actions, which they have only read, I have partly ſeen, and partly myſelf atchieved. What they know by reading, I know by action. They are pleaſed to ſlight my mean birth: I deſpiſe their mean characters. Want of birth and fortune is the objection againſt me; want
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:021451_0288_0FB3F7B39C7CC538"/>
of perſonal worth, againſt them. But are not all men of the ſame ſpecies? What can make a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween one man and another, but the endowments of the mind? For my part, I ſhall always look upon the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt man as the nobleſt man. Suppoſe it were enquired of the fathers of ſuch Patricians as Albinus and Beſtia, whether, if they had their choice, they would deſire ſons of their character, or of mine: what would they anſwer, but that they ſhould wiſh the worthieſt to be their ſons? If the Patricians have reaſon to deſpiſe me, let them likewiſe deſpiſe their anceſtors, whoſe nobility was the fruit of their virtue. Do they envy the honors beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon me? let them envy, likewiſe, my labors, my abſtinence, and the dangers I have undergone for my country, by which I have acquired them. But thoſe worthleſs men lead ſuch a life of inactivity, as if they deſpiſed any honors you can beſtow; whilſt they aſpire to honors, as if they had deſerved them by the moſt induſtrious virtue. They lay claim to the rewards of activity, for their having enjoyed the pleaſures of lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury. Yet none can be more laviſh than they are in praiſe of their anceſtors. And they imagine they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor themſelves by celebrating their forefathers; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they do the very contrary: for, as much as their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors were diſtinguiſhed for their virtues, ſo much are they diſgraced by their vices. The glory of anceſtors caſts a light, indeed, upon their poſterity; but it only ſerves to ſhow what the deſcendants are. It alike exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits to public view their degeneracy and their worth. I own I cannot boaſt of the deeds of my forefathers; but I hope I may anſwer the cavils of the Patricians by ſtanding up in defence of what I have myſelf done.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve now, my Countrymen, the injuſtice of the Patricians. They arrogate to themſelves honors on account of the exploits done by their forefathers, whilſt they will not allow me the due praiſe for performing the very ſame ſort of actions in my own perſon. He has no ſtatues, they cry of his family. He can trace no venerable line of anceſtors.—What then? Is it matter of more praiſe to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>grace one's illuſtrious anceſtors, than to become illuſtrious by one's own good behavior? What if I can ſhow no ſtatues of my family? I can ſhow

the ſtandards, the armor, and the trappings, which I have myſelf taken from the vanquiſhed: I can ſhow the ſcars of thoſe wounds, which I have received by facing the enemies of my country. Theſe are my ſtatues. Theſe are the honors I boaſt of. Not left me by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, as theirs; but earned by toil, by abſtinence, by valor; amidſt clouds of duſt and ſeas of blood: ſcenes of action, where thoſe effeminate Patricians, who endeavor by indirect means to depreciate me in your eſteem, have never dared to ſhow their faces.</p>

                  <head>II. SPEECH of PUBLIUS SCIPIO to the ROMAN AR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MY before the Battle of the TICIN.</head>
                  <p>WERE you, Soldiers, the ſame army which I had with me in Gaul, I might well forbear ſaying any thing to you at this time: for what occaſion could there be to uſe exhortation to a cavalry that had ſo ſignally vanquiſhed the ſquadrons of the enemy upon the Rhone; or to legions, by whom that ſame enemy, flying before them to avoid a battle, did in effect confeſs themſelves conquered? but as theſe troops, having been enrolled for Spain, are there with my brother <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>neius, making war under my auſpices (as was the will of the ſenate and people of Rome,) I, that you might have a conſul for your captain againſt Hannibal and the Carthaginians, have freely offered myſelf for this war. You, then, have a new general, and I a new army. On this account, a few words from me to you will be neither improper nor unſeaſonable.</p>
                  <p>That you may not be unappriſed of what ſort of enemies you are going to encounter, or of what is to be feared from them, they are the very ſame, whom, in a former war, you vanquiſhed both by land and ſea; the ſame from whom you took Sicily and Sardinia, and who have been theſe twenty years your tributaries. You will not, I preſume, march againſt theſe men with only that courage with which you are wont to face other ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: but with a certain anger and indignation, ſuch as you would feel if you ſaw your ſlaves on a ſudden riſe up in arms againſt you. Conquered and enſlaved, it is not boldneſs, but neceſſity, that urges them to battle; unleſs you can believe that thoſe who avoided fighting
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:021451_0290_0FB3F7B69CF0F750"/>
when their army was entire, have acquired better hope by the loſs of two-thirds of their horſe and foot in the paſſage of the Alps.</p>
                  <p>But you have heard, perhaps, that, though they are few in number, they are men of ſtout hearts and robuſt bodies; heroes of ſuch ſtrength and vigor as nothing is able to reſiſt.—Mere effigies! nay, ſhadows of men! wretches, emaciated with hunger, and benumbed with cold! bruiſed and battered to pieces among the rocks and craggy cliffs! their weapons broken, and their horſes weak and foundered! Such are the cavalry, and ſuch the infantry, with which you are going to contend; not enemies, but the fragments of enemies. There is nothing which I more apprehend, than that it will be thought Hannibal was vanquiſhed by the Alps before we had any conflict with him. But, perhaps, it was fitting it ſhould be ſo; and that, with a people and a leader who had violated leagues and covenants, the gods themſelves, without man's help, ſhould begin the war, and bring it to a near concluſion; and that we, who, next to the gods, have been injured and offended, ſhould happily finiſh what they have begun.</p>
                  <p>I need not be in any fear that you ſhould ſuſpect me of ſaying theſe things merely to encourage you, while inwardly I have different ſentiments. What hindered me from going into Spain? That was my province, where I ſhould have had the leſs dreaded Aſdrubal, not Hannibal, to deal with. But, hearing, as I paſſed along the coaſt of Gaul, of this enemy's march, I landed my troops, ſent the horſe forward, and pitched my camp upon the Rhone. A part of my cavalry encountered, and defeated that of the enemy. My infantry not being able to overtake theirs, which fled before us, I returned to my fleet; and, with all the expedition I could uſe in ſo long a voyage by ſea and land, am come to meet them at the foot of the Alps. Was it, then, my inclination to avoid a conteſt with this tremendous Hannibal? and have I met with him only by accident and unawares? or am I come on purpoſe to challenge him to the combat? I would gladly try, whether the earth, within theſe twenty years, has brought forth a new kind of Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians; or whether they be the ſame ſort of men who
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:021451_0291_0FB3F7B81D7D6488"/>
fought at the Aegates, and whom, at Eryx, you ſuffered to redeem themſelves at eighteen denarii per head: whether this Hannibal, for labors and journeys, be, as he would be thought, the rival of Hercules; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be, what his father left him, a tributary, a vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, a ſlave of the Roman people. Did not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of his wicked deed at Saguntum torment him and make him deſperate, he would have ſome regard, if not to his conquered country, yet ſurely to his own fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, to his father's memory, to the treaty written with Amilcar's own hand. We might have ſtarved him in Eryx; we might have paſſed into Africa with our victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious fleet, and, in a few days, have deſtroyed Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage. At their humble ſupplication, we pardoned them; we releaſed them, when they were cloſely ſhut up without a poſſibility of eſcaping; we made peace with them when they were conquered. When they were diſtreſſed by the African war, we conſidered them, we treated them, as a people under our protection. And what is the return they make us for all theſe favors? Under the conduct of a hair-brained young man, they come hither to overturn our ſtate, and lay waſte our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.—I could wiſh, indeed, that it were not ſo; and that the war we are now engaged in concerned only our own glory, and not our preſervation. But the conteſt at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent is not for the poſſeſſion of Sicily and Sardinia, but of Italy itſelf: nor is there behind us another army, which, if we ſhould not prove the conquerors, may make head againſt our victorious enemies. There are no more Alps for them to paſs, which might give us leiſure to raiſe new forces. No, Soldiers; here you muſt make your ſtand, as if you were juſt now before the walls of Rome. Let every one refle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <head>III. SPEECH of HANNIBAL to the CARTHAGINIAN AR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MY, on the ſame OCCASION.</head>
                  <p>I KNOW not, Soldiers, whether you or your priſoners be encompaſſed by fortune with the ſtricter bonds and neceſſities. Two ſeas encloſe you on the right and left; not a ſhip to fly to for eſcaping. Before you is the Po, a river broader and more rapid than the Rhone: behind you are the Alps; over which, even when your numbers were undiminiſhed, you were hardly able to force a paſſage. Here, then, Soldiers, you muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conquer or die the very firſt hour you meet the enemy.</p>
                  <p>But the ſame fortune which has thus laid you under the neceſſity of fighting, has ſet before your eyes the moſt glorious rewards of victory. Should we, by our valor, recover only Sicily and Sardinia, which were raviſhed from our fathers, thoſe would be no inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able prizes. Yet, what are thoſe? The wealth of Rome; whatever riches ſhe has heaped together in the ſpoils of nations; all theſe with the maſters of them, will be yours. The time is now come to reap the full recompenſe of your toilſome marches, over ſo many mountains and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and through ſo many nations, all of them in arms. This is the place which Fortune has appointed to be the limits of your labor; it is here that you will finiſh your glorious warfare, and receive an ample recompenſe of your completed ſervice. For I would not have you imagine, that victory will be as difficult as the name of a Roman war is great and ſounding. It has often happened that a deſpiſed enemy has given a bloody battle; and the moſt renowned kings and nations have by a ſmall force been overthrown. And, if you but take away the glitter of the Roman name, what is there wherein they may ſtand in competition with you? For (to ſay nothing of your ſervice in war, for twenty years together, with ſo much valor and ſucceſs) from the very pillars of Hercules, from the ocean, from the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt bounds of the earth, through ſo many warlike na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Spain and Gaul, are you not come hither vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious? And with whom have you now to fight? With raw ſoldiers, an undiſciplined army, beaten, vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="294" facs="unknown:021451_0293_0FB3F7BB1D5811D8"/>
beſieged by the Gauls the very laſt ſummer; an army unknown to their leader, and unacquainted with him.</p>
                  <p>Or ſhall I, who was born, I might almoſt ſay, but certainly brought up, in the tent of my father, that moſt excellent general; ſhall I, the conqueror of Spain and Gaul, and not only of the Alpine nations, but, which is greater ſtill, of the Alps themſelves; ſhall I compare myſelf with this half-year captain? a captain, before whom ſhould one place the two armies without their enſigns, I am perſuaded he would not know to which of them he is conſul. I eſteem it no ſmall advantage, Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, that there is not one among you, who has not often been an eye-witneſs of my exploits in war: not one, of whoſe valor I myſelf have not been a ſpectator, ſo as to be able to name the times and places of his noble achieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; that with ſoldiers, whom I have a thouſand times praiſed and rewarded, and whoſe pupil I was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I became their general, I ſhall march againſt an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of men ſtrangers to one another.</p>
                  <p>On what ſide ſoever I turn my eyes, I behold all full of courage and ſtrength. A veteran infantry; a moſt gallant cavalry; you, my Allies, moſt faithful and val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant; you, Carthaginians, whom not only your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try's cauſe, but the juſteſt anger, impels to battle. The hope, the courage of aſſailants, is always greater than of thoſe who act upon the defenſive. With hoſtile ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners diſplayed, you are come down upon Italy: you bring the war. Grief, injuries, indignities, fire your minds, and ſpur you forward to revenge.—Firſt, they demanded me, that I, your general, ſhould be delivered up to them; next, all of you who had fought at the ſiege of Saguntum: and we were to be put to death by the extremeſt tortures. Proud and cruel nation! Every thing muſt be yours, and at your diſpoſal? You are to preſcribe to us with whom we ſhall make war, with whom ſhall we make peace? You are to ſet us bounds; to ſhut us up within hills and rivers; but you are not to obſerve the limits which yourſelves have fixed! "Paſs not the Iberus." What next? "Touch not the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guntines; Saguntum is upon the Iberus, move not a ſtep towards that city." Is it a ſmall matter, then, that
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:021451_0294_0FB3F7BE21630EE0"/>
you have deprived us of our ancient poſſeſſions, Sicily and Sardinia? you would have Spain too. Well; we ſhall yield Spain, and then—you will paſs into Africa.— Will paſs, did I ſay?—this very year they ordered one of their conſuls into Africa, the other into Spain. No, Soldiers; there is nothing left for us but what we can vindicate with our ſwords. Come on, then. Be men. The Romans may, with more ſafety, be cowards: they have their own country behind them, have places of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge to fly to, and are ſecure from danger in the roads thither; but, for you, there is no middle fortune between death and victory. Let this be but well fixed in your minds; and, once again, I ſay you are conquerors.</p>

                  <p>IT is known to you, that king Micipſa, my father, on his deathbed, left in charge to Jugurtha, his adopted ſon, conjunctly with my unfortunate brother Hiempſal, and myſelf, the children of his own body, the adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of the kingdom of Numidia, directing us to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſenate and people of Rome as proprietors of it. He charged us to uſe our beſt endeavors to be ſervicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Roman commonwealth, in peace and war; aſſuring us, that your protection would prove to us a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt all enemies, and would be inſtead of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, fortifications, and treaſures.</p>
                  <p>While my brother and I were thinking of nothing but how to regulate ourſelves according to the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our deceaſed father—Jugurtha—the moſt infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous of mankind!—breaking through all ties of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and of common humanity, and trampling on the authority of the Roman commonwealth, procured the murder of my unfortunate brother, and has driven me from my throne and native country, though he knows I inherit, from my grandfather Maſſiniſſa, and my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Micipſa, the friendſhip and alliance of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</p>
                  <p>For a prince to be reduced, by villany, to my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſsful circumſtances, is calamity enough; but my misfortunes are heightened by the conſideration that I
<pb n="296" facs="unknown:021451_0295_0FB3F7C024B70088"/>
find myſelf obliged to ſolicit your aſſiſtance, Fathers, for the ſervices done you by my anceſtors, not for any I have been able to render you in my own perſon. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurtha has put it out of my power to deſerve any thing at your hands; and has forced me to be burdenſome, before I could be uſeful to you. And yet, if I had no plea, but my undeſerved miſery—a once powerful prince, the deſcendant of a race of illuſtrious monarchs, now, without any fault of my own, deſtitute of every ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and reduced to the neceſſity of begging foreign aſſiſtance, againſt an enemy who has ſeized my throne and my kingdom—if my unequalled diſtreſſes were all I had to plead—it would become the greatneſs of the Roman commonwealth, the arbitreſs of the world, to protect the injured, and to check the triumph of daring wickedneſs over helpleſs innocence.—But, to provoke your vengeance to the utmoſt, Jugurtha has driven me from the very dominions, which the ſenate and people of Rome gave to my anceſtors: and, from which, my grandfather, and my father, under your umbrage, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled Syphax and the Carthaginians. Thus, Fathers, your kindneſs to our family is defeated; and Jugurtha, in injuring me, throws contempt on you.</p>
                  <p>Oh wretched prince! Oh cruel reverſe of fortune! Oh father Micipſa! is this the conſequence of your gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity; that he, whom your goodneſs raiſed to an equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity with your own chidren, ſhould be the murderer of your children? Muſt, then, the royal houſe of Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midia always be a ſcene of havoc and blood? While Carthage remained, we ſuffered, as was to be expected, all ſorts of hardſhips from their hoſtile attacks: our enemy near: our only powerful ally, the Roman com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, at a diſtance. While we were ſo circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced, we were always in arms, and in action. When that ſcourge of Africa was no more, we congratulated ourſelves on the proſpect of eſtabliſhed peace. But, inſtead of peace, behold the kingdom of Numidia drenched with royal blood! and the only ſurviving ſon of its late king, flying from an adopted murderer, and ſeeking that ſafety in foreign parts which he cannot command in his own kingdom.</p>
                  <p>Whither—Oh! whither ſhall I fly? If I return to
<pb n="297" facs="unknown:021451_0296_0FB3F7C11DB4E390"/>
the royal palace of my anceſtors, my father's throne is ſeized by the murderer of my brother. What can I there expect, but that Jugurtha ſhould haſten to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brue, in my blood, thoſe hands which are now reek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with my brother's? If I were to fly for refuge, or for aſſiſtance, to any other court; from what prince can I hope for protection, if the Roman commonwealth gives me up? From my own family or friends I have no expectations. My royal father is no more. He is beyond the reach of violence, and out of hearing of the complaints of his unhappy ſon. Were my brother alive, our mutual ſympathy would be ſome alleviation. But he is hurried out of life, in his early youth, by the very hand which ſhould have been the laſt to injure any of the royal family of Numidia. The bloody Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurtha has butchered all whom he ſuſpected to be in my intereſt. Some have been deſtroyed by the linger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing torment of the croſs. Others have been given a prey to wild beaſts, and their anguiſh made the ſport of men more cruel than wild beaſts. If there be any yet alive, they are ſhut up in dungeons, there to drag out a life more intolerable than death itſelf.</p>
                  <p>Look down, illuſtrious ſenators of Rome! from that height of power to which you are raiſed, on the unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampled diſtreſſes of a prince, who is, by the cruelty of a wicked intruder, become an outcaſt from all mankind. Let not the crafty inſinuations of him who returns murder for adoption, prejudice your judgment. Do not liſten to the wretch who has butchered the ſon and relations of a king, who gave him power to ſit on the ſame throne with his own ſons.—I have been informed, that he labors by his emiſſaries to prevent your deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining any thing againſt him in his abſence; pretending that I magnify my diſtreſs, and might for him have ſtaid in peace in my own kingdom. But if ever the time comes when the due vengeance from above ſhall overtake him, he will then diſſemble as I do. Then he, who now, hardened in wickedneſs, triumphs over thoſe whom his violence has laid low, will, in his turn, feel diſtreſs, and ſuffer for his impious ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to my father, and his blood-thirſty cruelty to my brother.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="298" facs="unknown:021451_0297_0FB3F7C29D67C948"/>Oh murdered butchered brother! Oh deareſt to my heart—now gone for ever from my ſight!—But, why ſhould I lament his death? He is, indeed, deprived of the bleſſed light of heaven, of life, and kingdom, at once, by the very perſon who ought to have been the firſt to hazard his own life in defence of any one of Micipſa's family: but, as things are, my brother is not ſo much deprived of theſe comforts, as delivered from terror, from flight, from exile, and the endleſs train of miſeries which render life to me a burden. He lies full low, gored with wounds, and feſtering in his own blood. But he lies in peace. He feels none of the miſeries which rend my ſoul with agony and diſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, while I am ſet up a ſpectacle to all mankind of the uncertainty of human affairs. So far from having it in my power to revenge his death, I am not maſter of the means of ſecuring my own life. So far from being in a condition to defend my kingdom from the violence of the uſurper, I am obliged to apply for fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign protection for my own perſon.</p>
                  <p>Fathers! Senators of Rome! the arbiters of the world! —to you I fly for refuge from the murderous fury of Jugurtha.—By your affection for your children, by your love for your country, by your own virtues, by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of the Roman commonwealth, by all that is ſacred, and all that is dear to you—deliver a wretched prince from undeſerved, unprovoked injury; and ſave the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Numidia, which is your own property, from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the prey of violence, uſurpation, and cruelty.</p>

                  <head>V. Speech of CANULEIUS to the Conſuls; in which he demands that the PLEBEIANS may be admitted into the Conſulſhip, and that the law prohibiting PATRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CIANS and PLEBEIANS from intermarrying may be repealed.</head>
                  <p>WHAT an inſult upon us is this! If we are not ſo rich as the Patricians, are we not citizens of Rome as well as they? inhabitants of the ſame country? mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the ſame community? The nations bordering up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Rome, and even ſtrangers more remote, are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, not only to marriages with us, but to what is of much greater importance, the freedom of the city. Are

the decemvirs enacted it? and a moſt ſhameful one it is in a free ſtate. Such marriages, it ſeems, will taint the pure blood of the nobility! Why, if they think ſo, let them take care to match their ſiſters and daughters with men of their own ſort. No Plebeian will do violence to the daughter of a Patrician. Thoſe are exploits for our prime nobles. There is no need to fear that we ſhall force any body into a contract of marriage. But, to make an expreſs law to prohibit marriages of Patrici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans with Plebeians, what is this but to ſhow the utmoſt contempt of us, and to declare one part of community to be impure and unclean?</p>
                  <p>They talk to us of the confuſion there will be in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies if this ſtatute ſhould be repealed. I wonder they don't make a law againſt a commoner's living near a nobleman, or going the ſame road that he is going, or being preſent at the ſame feaſt, or appearing in the ſame market-place. They might as well pretend that theſe things make confuſion in families, as that intermarriages will do it. Does not every one know, that the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren will be ranked according to the quality of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, let him be a Patrician or a Plebeian? In ſhort, it is manifeſt enough that we have nothing in view but to be treated as men and citizens; nor can they who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our demand have any motive to do it but the love of domineering. I would fain know of you, Conſuls and Patricians, is the ſovereign power in the people of Rome, or in you? I hope you will allow, that the people can, at their pleaſure, either make a law or repeal one. And will you, then, as ſoon as any law is propoſed to them, pretend to liſt them immediately for the war, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them from giving their ſuffrages by leading them into the field?</p>
                  <p>Hear me, conſuls. Whether the news of the war you talk of be true, or whether it be only a falſe rumor ſpread abroad for nothing but a color to ſend the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple out of the city, I declare, as tribune, that this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who have already ſo often ſpilt their blood in our country's cauſe, are again ready to arm for its defence and its glory, if they may be reſtored to their natural rights, and you will no longer treat us like ſtrangers in our own country: but, if you account us unworthy of
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:021451_0299_0FB5CF940B62DF08"/>
we, becauſe we are commoners, to be treated worſe than ſtrangers? And, when we demand that the people may be free to beſtow their offices and dignities on whom they pleaſe, do we aſk any thing unreaſonable or new? Do we claim more than their original inherent right? What occaſion, then, for all this uproar, as if the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe were falling to ruin? They were juſt going to lay violent hands upon me in the ſenate-houſe.</p>
                  <p>What! muſt this empire, then, be unavoidably over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned: muſt Rome of neceſſity ſink at once, if a Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beian, worthy of the office, ſhould be raiſed to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulſhip? The Patricians, I am perſuaded, if they could, would deprive you of the common light. It certainly offends them that you breathe, that you ſpeak, that you have the ſhapes of men. Nay, but to make a commoner a conſul, would be, ſay they, a moſt enormous thing. Numa Pompilius, however, without being ſo much as a Roman citizen, was made king of Rome. The elder Tarquin, by birth not even an Italian, was nevertheleſs placed upon the throne. Servius Tullius, the ſon of a captive woman (nobody knows who his father was), obtained the kingdom as the reward of his wiſdom and virtue. In thoſe days, no man in whom virtue ſhone conſpicuous was rejected or deſpiſed on account of his race and deſcent. And did the ſtate proſper the leſs for that? Were not theſe ſtrangers of the very beſt of all our kings? and ſuppoſing, now, that a Plebeian ſhould have their talents and merit, muſt not he be ſuffered to govern us.</p>
                  <p>But, "we find, that, upon the abolition of the regal power, no commoner was choſen to the conſulate." And what of that? Before Numa's time, there were no pontiffs in Rome. Before Servius Tullius's days, there were no cenſus, no diviſion of people into claſſes and centuries. Who ever heard of conſuls, before the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion of Tarquin the Proud? Dictators, we all know, are of modern invention; and ſo are the offices of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes, aediles, quaeſtors. Within theſe ten years we have made decemvirs, and we have unmade them. Is nothing to be done but what has been done before? That very law forbidding marriages of Patricians with Plebeians, is not that a new thing? Was there any ſuch law before

your alliance by intermarriages, if you will not ſuffer the entrance to the chief offices in the ſtate to be open to all perſons of merit indifferently, but will confine you choice of magiſtrates to the ſenate alone—talk of wars as much as ever you pleaſe; paint, in your ordinary diſcourſes, the league and power of our enemies, ten times more dreadful than you do now—I declare, that this people whom you ſo much deſpiſe, and to whom you are nevertheleſs indebted for all your victories— ſhall never more inſiſt themſelves; not a man of them ſhall take arms; not a man of them ſhall expoſe his life for imperious lords, with whom he can neither ſhare the dignities of the ſtate, nor in private life have any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance by marriage.</p>

                  <head>VI. SPEECH of JUNIUS BRUTUS over the dead BODY of LUCRETIA.</head>
                  <p>YES, noble lady, I ſwear by this blood, which was once ſo pure, and which nothing but royal villany could have polluted, that I will purſue Lucius Tarqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius the Proud, his wicked wife, and their children, with fire and ſword; nor will I ever ſuffer any of that family, or of any other whatſoever, to be king in Rome: Ye gods, I call you to witneſs this my oath!—There, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, turn your eyes to that ſad ſpectacle—the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Lucretius, Collatinus's wife—ſhe died by her own hand. See there a noble lady, whom the luſt of a Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin reduced to the neceſſity of being her own execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner, to atteſt her innocence. Hoſpitably entertained by her as a kinſman of her huſband's, Sextus, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious gueſt, became her brutal raviſher. The chaſte, the generous Lucretia, could not ſurvive the inſult. Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous woman! But once only treated as a ſlave, ſhe thought life no longer to be endured. Lucretia, a woman, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained a life that depended on a tyrant's will; and ſhall we—ſhall men, with ſuch an example before our eyes, and after five-and-twenty years of ignominious ſervitude, ſhall we, through a fear of dying, defer one ſingle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to aſſert our liberty? No, Romans, now is the time; the favorable moment we have ſo long waited for is come. Tarquin is not at Rome. The Patricians are at the head of the enterpriſe. The city is abundantly
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:021451_0301_0FB525617690BC18"/>
provided with men, arms, and all things neceſſary. There is nothing wanting to ſecure the ſucceſs, if our own courage does not fail us. And ſhall thoſe warriors, who have ever been ſo brave when foreign enemies were to be ſubdued, or when conqueſts were to be made to gratify the ambition and avarice of Tarquin, be then only cowards, when they are to deliver themſelves from ſlavery?—Some of you are perhaps intimidated by the army which Tarquin now commands. The ſoldiers, you imagine, will take the part of their general. Baniſh ſo groundleſs a fear. The love of liberty is natural to all men. Your fellow-citizens in the camp feel the weight of oppreſſion with as quick a ſenſe as you that are in Rome: they will as eagerly ſeize the occaſion of throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off the yoke. But, let us grant there may be ſome among them, who, through baſeneſs of ſpirit or a bad education, will be diſpoſed to favor the tyrant. The number of theſe can be but ſmall, and we have means ſufficient in our hands to reduce them to reaſon. They have left us hoſtages more dear to them than life. Their wives, their children, their fathers, their mothers, are here in the city. Courage, Romans, the gods are for us; thoſe gods, whoſe temples and altars the impious Tarquin has profaned by ſacrifices and libations made with polluted hands, polluted with blood, and with num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs unexpiated crimes committed againſt his ſubjects. —Ye gods, who protected our forefathers, ye genii, who watch for the preſervation and glory of Rome, do you inſpire us with courage and unanimity in this glorious cauſe, and we will, to our laſt breath, defend your worſhip from all profanation.</p>

                  <head>DEMOSTHENES to the ATHENIANS, exciting them to proſecute the WAR againſt PHILIP.</head>
                  <p>WHEN I compare, Athenians, the ſpeeches of ſome amongſt us with their actions, I am at a loſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile what I ſee with what I hear. Their proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations are full of zeal againſt the public enemy; but their meaſures are ſo inconſiſtent, that all their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions become ſuſpected. By confounding you with a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of projects, they perplex your reſolutions; and lead
<pb n="303" facs="unknown:021451_0302_0FB5256517A2F2F8"/>
you from executing what is in your power, by engaging you in ſchemes not reducible to practice.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, there was a time, when we were powerful enough, not only to defend our own borders, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect our allies, but even to invade Philip in his own do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions. Yes, Athenians, there was ſuch a juncture; I remember it well. But, by neglect of proper opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, we are no longer in a ſituation to be invaders: it will be well for us, if we can provide for our own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and our allies. Never did any conjuncture require ſo much prudence as this. However, I ſhould not deſpair of ſeaſonable remedies, had I the art to prevail with you to be unanimous in right meaſures. The opportunities which have ſo often eſcaped us, have not been loſt thro' ignorance or want of judgment, but through negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence or treachery.—If I aſſume, at this time, more than ordinary liberty of ſpeech, I conjure you to ſuffer patiently thoſe truths which have no other end but your own good. You have too many reaſons to be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible how much you have ſuffered by hearkening to ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cophants. I ſhall, therefore, be plain in laying before you the grounds of paſt miſcarriages, in order to correct you in your future conduct.</p>
                  <p>You may remember, it is not above three or four years ſince we had the news of Philip's laying ſiege to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs of Juno in Thrace. It was, as I think, in Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, we received this intelligence. We voted an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate ſupply of threeſcore talents; forty men of war were ordered to ſea; and ſo zealous we were, that, preferring the neceſſities of ſtate to our very laws, our citizens above the age of five-and-forty years were commanded to ſerve. What followed?—A whole year was ſpent idly without any thing done; and it was but in the third month of the following year, a little after the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the feaſt of Ceres, that Charedemus ſet ſail, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with no more than five talents, and ten galleys not half-manned.</p>
                  <p>A rumor was ſpread, that Philip was ſick. That ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor was followed by another, that Philip was dead. And, then, as if all danger died with him, you dropped your preparations: whereas, then, then was your time to puſh, and be active; then was your time to ſec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

yourſelves, and confound him at once. Had your reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, taken with ſo much heat, been as warmly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by action, you had then been as terrible to Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip, as Philip, recovered, is now to you. "To what purpoſe, at this time, theſe reflections? What is done, cannot be undone." But, by your leave, Athenians, though paſt moments are not to be recalled, paſt errors may be repeated. Have we not, now, a freſh provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to war? Let the memory of overſights, by which you have ſuffered ſo much, inſtruct you to be more vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant in the preſent danger. If the Olynthians are not inſtantly ſuccoured, and with your utmoſt efforts, you become aſſiſtants to Philip, and ſerve him more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally than he can help himſelf.</p>
                  <p>It is not, ſurely, neceſſary to warn you, that votes alone can be of no conſequence. Had your reſolutions, of themſelves, the virtue to compaſs what you intend, we ſhould not ſee them multiply every day, as they do, and upon every occaſion, with ſo little effect; nor would Philip be in a condition to brave and affront us in this manner.—Proceed, then, Athenians, to ſupport your deliberations with vigor. You have heads capable of adviſing what is beſt; you have judgment and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to diſcern what is right; and you have power and opportunity to execute what you determine. What time ſo proper for action? What occaſion ſo happy? And when can you hope for ſuch another, if this be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected? Has not Philip, contrary to all treaties, inſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you in Thrace? Does he not, at this inſtant, ſtraiten and invade your confederates, whom you have ſolemnly ſworn to protect? Is he not an implacable enemy? a faithleſs ally? the uſurper of provinces, to which he has no title nor pretence? a ſtranger, a barbarian, a tyrant? and, indeed, what is he not?</p>
                  <p>Obſerve, I beſeech you, men of Athens, how different your conduct appears, from the practices of your anceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. They were friends to truth and plain dealing, and deteſted flattery and ſervile compliance. By unanimous conſent, they continued arbiters of all Greece, for the ſpace of forty-five years, without interruption: a public fund, of no leſs than ten thouſand talents, was ready ſo any emergency: they exerciſed over the kings of Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="305" facs="unknown:021451_0304_0FB5256BDEA2E540"/>
that authority which is due to barbarians; obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, both by ſea and land, in their own perſons, frequent and ſignal victories; and, by their noble exploits, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to poſterity an immortal memory of their virtue, ſuperior to the reach of malice and detraction. It is to them we owe that great number of public edifices, by which the city of Athens exceeds all the reſt of the world in beauty and magnificence. It is to them we owe ſo many ſtately temples, ſo richly embelliſhed, but, above all, adorned with the ſpoils of vanquiſhed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.—But, viſit their own private habitations; viſit the houſes of Ariſtides, Miltiades, or any other of thoſe patriots of antiquity;—you will find nothing, not the leaſt mark or ornament, to diſtinguiſh them from their neighbors. They took part in the government, not to enrich themſelves, but the public; they had no ſcheme or ambition, but for the public; nor knew any intereſt, but the public. It was by a cloſe and ſteady application to the general good of their country, by an exemplary piety towards the immortal gods, by a ſtrict faith and religious honeſty betwixt man and man, and a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration always uniform and of a piece, they eſtabliſhed that reputation, which remains to this day, and will laſt to utmoſt poſterity.</p>
                  <p>Such, O men of Athens! were your anceſtors: ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in the eye of the world; ſo bountiful and munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent to their country; ſo ſparing, ſo modeſt, ſo ſelf-denying to themſelves. What reſemblance can we find, in the preſent generation, of theſe great men? At a time, when your ancient competitors have left you a clear ſtage; when the Lacedemonians are diſabled; the Thebans em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in troubles of their own; when no other ſtate whatever is in a condition to rival or moleſt you; in ſhort, when you are at full liberty; when you have the opportunity and the power to become once more the ſole arbiters of Greece;—you permit, patiently, whole provinces to be wreſted from you; you laviſh the public money in ſcandalous and obſcure uſes; you ſuffer your allies to periſh in times of peace, whom you preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in time of war; and, to ſum up all, you yourſelves, by your mercenary court, and ſervile reſignation to the will and pleaſure of deſigning, inſidious leaders, abet,

encourage, and ſtrengthen the moſt dangerous and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable of your enemies. Yes, Athenians, I repeat it, you yourſelves are the contrivers of your own ruin. Lives there a man who has confidence enough to deny it? let him ariſe, and aſſign, if he can, any other cauſe of the ſucceſs and proſperity of Philip. "But," you reply, "what Athens may have loſt in reputation abroad, ſhe has gained in ſplendor at home. Was there ever a greater appearance of proſperity; a greater face of plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Is not the city enlarged? Are not the ſtreets better paved, houſes repaired and beautified?"—Away with ſuch trifles! Shall I be paid with counters? An old ſquare new vamped up! a fountain! an aqueduct! Are theſe acquiſitions to brag of? Caſt your eye upon the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, under whoſe miniſtry you boaſt theſe precious improvements. Behold the deſpicable creature, raiſed, all at once, from dirt to opulence; from the loweſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity to the higheſt honors. Have not ſome of theſe upſtarts built private houſes and ſeats vying with the moſt ſumptuous of our public palaces? And how have their fortunes and their power increaſed, but as the commonwealth has been ruined and impoveriſhed!</p>
                  <p>To what are we to impute theſe diſorders; and to what cauſe aſſign the decay of a ſtate ſo powerful and flouriſhing in paſt times?—The reaſon is plain. The ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant is now become the maſter. The magiſtrate was then ſubſervient to the people; puniſhments and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards were properties of the people; all honors, dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and preferments, were diſpoſed by the voice and favor of the people: but the magiſtrate, now, has uſurped the right of the people, and exerciſes an arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary authority over his ancient and natural lord. You miſerable people! the meanwhile, without money, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out friends; from being the ruler, are become the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; from being the maſter, the dependant: happy that theſe governors, into whoſe hands you have thus reſigned your own power, are ſo good and ſo gracious as to continue your poor allowance to ſee plays.</p>
                  <p>Believe me, Athenians, if, recovering from this le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy, you would aſſume the ancient freedom and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of your fathers; if you would be your own ſoldiers and your own commanders, confiding no longer your
<pb n="307" facs="unknown:021451_0306_0FB5257422DF5E40"/>
affairs in foreign or mercenary hands; if you would charge yourſelves in your own defenee, employing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, for the public, what you waſte in unprofitable pleaſures at home; the world might, once more, behold you making a figure worthy of Athenians. "You would have us then (you ſay) do ſervice in our armies, in our own perſons; and, for ſo doing, you would have the penſions we receive in time of peace accepted as pay in time of war. Is it thus we are to underſtand you?" —Yes, Athenians, 'tis my plain meaning. I would make it a ſtanding rule, that no perſon, great or little, ſhould be the better for the public money, who ſhould grudge to employ it for the public ſervice. Are we in peace! the public is charged with your ſubſiſtence. Are we in war, or under a neceſſity, as at this time, to enter into a war? let your gratitude oblige you to accept, as pay, in defence of your benefactors, what you receive, in peace, as mere bounty—Thus, without any innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; without altering or aboliſhing any thing, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious novelties, introduced for the encouragement of ſloth and idleneſs; by converting only, for the future, the ſame funds, for the uſe of the ſerviceable, which are ſpent, at preſent, upon the unprofitable; you may be well ſerved in your armies; your troops regularly paid; juſtice duly adminiſtered; the public revenues reformed, and increaſed; and every member of the commonwealth, rendered uſeful to his country, according to his age and ability, without any further burden to the ſtate.</p>
                  <p>This, O men of Athens! is what my duty prompted me to repreſent to you upon this occaſion.—May the gods inſpire you, to determine upon ſuch meaſures, as may be moſt expedient, for the particular and general good of our country!</p>

                        <p>I thank you heartily, good Mr. Stockwell. You and I have long converſed at a diſtance: now we are met: and the pleaſure this meeting gives me, amply com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſates for the perils I have run through in accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>

                        <p>Why, faith, it was all my own fault. Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to a land of ſlaves, and out of patience with the whole tribe of cuſtom-houſe extortioners, boatmen, tide-waiters, and water-bailiffs, that beſet me on all ſides worſe than a ſwarm of muſquetoes, I preceeded a little too roughly to bruſh them away with my ratan.

ſturdy rogues took this in dudgeon; and, beginning to rebel, the mob-choſe different ſides, and a furious ſcuffle enſued; in the courſe of which, my perſon and apparel ſuffered ſo much, that I was obliged to ſtep into the firſt tavern to refit, before I could make my approaches in any decent trim.</p>

Were I only a viſitor, I might perhaps wiſh them a little more tractable; but, as a fellow-ſubject and a ſharer in their freedom, I applaud their ſpirit—though I feel the effects of it in every bone in my ſkin.—Well, Mr Stockwell, for the firſt time in my life, here am I in England; at the fountain-head of pleaſure; in the land of beauty, of arts, and elegancies.

                        <p>Oh, my dear, you are the moſt miſtaken in the world! married people have things to talk of, child, that never enter into the imagination of others.— Why, here's my lord and I, now, we have not been married above two ſhort years, you know, and we have already eight or ten things conſtantly in bank, that, whenever we want company, we can take up any one of them for two hours together, and the ſubject never the flatter; nay, if we have occaſion for it, it will be as freſh next day too, as it was the firſt hour it entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us.</p>

                        <p>Oh, there's no life like it! Why, t'other day, for example, when you dined abroad, my lord and I, after a pretty cheerful tete-a-tete meal, ſat us down by the fire-ſide, in an eaſy, indolent, pick-tooth way, for about a quarter of an hour, as if we had not thought of any other's being in the room.—At laſt, ſtretching himſelf and yawning—My dear, ſays he,—aw— you come home very late laſt night.—'Twas but juſt turned of two, ſays I.—I was in bed—aw—by eleven, ſays he.—So you are every night, ſays I.— Well, ſays he, I am amazed you can ſit up ſo late.— How can you be amazed, ſays I, at a thing that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens ſo often!—Upon which we entered into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation! and though this is a point has entertained us above fifty times already, we always find ſo many pretty new things to ſay upon it, that I believe in my ſoul it will laſt as long as we live.</p>

                        <p>Oh, yes! which does not do amiſs at all. A ſmart repartee, with a zeſt of recrimination at the head of it, makes the prettieſt ſherbet. Ay, ay, if we did not mix a little of the acid with it, a matrimonial ſociety would be ſo luſcious, that nothing but an old liquoriſh prude would be able to bear it.</p>

of a table: ſhe has a very little ſtomach: ſhe does not eat above an ounce in a fortnight: and then, as to the quality of what ſhe eats, you'll have no need of a French cook upon her account. As for ſweet-meats, ſhe mortally hates them ſo there is the article of deſſerts wiped off all at once. You'll have no need of a confec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner, who would be eternally bringing in bills for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, conſerves, biſcuits, comfits, and jellies, of which half a dozen ladies would ſwallow you ten pounds worth at a meal. This, I think, we may very moderately reckon at two hundred pounds a-year at leaſt.—For clothes, ſhe has been bred up at ſuch a plainneſs in them, that ſhould we allow but for three birthnight-ſuits a-year ſaved, which are the leaſt a town-lady would expect, there go a good two hundred pounds a-year more.—For jewels (of which ſhe hates the very ſight) the yearly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of what you muſt lay out in them would amount to one hundred pounds.—Laſtly, ſhe has an utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation to play, at which I have known ſeveral mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ladies loſe a good two thouſand pounds a-year.

                        <p>Great god of eloquence, you will not, I am perſuaded, ſtop a famous lawyer and orator. I am maſter of every trope and figure that ever was heard of. I can make any cauſe good. By the time I have talked half an hour, there is not a judge on the bench, that knows which ſide the right is on, or whether there be any right on either ſide. And then, for brow-beating, and finding uſeful and ſeaſonable demurs, quirks, and the like, I dare challenge—</p>

                        <p>Mercury, I do intreat you to let me come into the boat. I am ſure, judge Minos will paſs a very favourable ſentence on me. For it is well known, that no body ever was a more exact obſerver of the religious ceremonies appointed by authority, and eſtabliſhed by cuſtom, than myſelf. And what was alledged againſt me, of my being given to cenſoriouſneſs, pride, and private ſins, is all falſe—almoſt—and—</p>

For I never did harm to any body; but was always ready to do any kindneſs in my power. And there is nothing can be alledged againſt me worth nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. For it is not true, that I believed neither God nor future ſtate. I was no Atheiſt, as has been alledged, but only a Free-thinker.</p>

                     <head>I. HAMLET's ADVICE to the PLAYERS.</head>
                     <p>SPEAK the ſpeech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you; trippingly on the tongue. But if you mouth it as many of our players do, I had as lieve the town-crier had ſpoke my lines. And, do not ſaw the air too much with your hand; but uſe all gently: for in the very torrent, tempeſt, and, as I may ſay, whirlwind of your paſſion, you muſt acquire and beget a temperance that may give it ſmoothneſs. Oh! it offends me to the ſoul, to hear a robuſteous periwig-pated fellow tear a paſſion to tatters, to very rags, to ſplit the ears of the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings; who (for the moſt part) are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb ſhows and noiſe. Pray, you avoid it.</p>
                     <p>Be not too tame neither: but let your own diſcretion be your tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with this ſpecial obſervance, that you o'er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtep not the modeſty of nature: for any thing ſo overdone, is from the purpoſe of playing; whoſe end is—to hold, as 'twere, the mirror up to nature; to ſhow virtue her own feature, ſcorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time, his form and preſſure. Now, this overdone or come tardy of, though it make the unſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of one of which, muſt, in your allowance, o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. Oh! there be players that I have ſeen play, and heard others praiſe, and that high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that, neither having the accent of chriſtian, nor the gait of chriſtian, pagan, nor man, have ſo ſtrutted and bellowed, that I have thought ſome of Nature's journey-men had made men, and not made them well; they imitated humanity ſo abominably.</p>

It illuminateth the face; which, as a beacon, gives warning to all the reſt of this little kingdom, man, to arm: and, then the vital commoners, and inland pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſpirits, muſter me all to their captain, the heart; who, great, and puffed up with this retinue, doth any deed of courage—and this valor comes of ſherris. So that ſkill in the weapon is nothing without ſack, for that ſets it awork; and learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, till ſack commences it, and ſets it in act and uſe. Hereof comes in that Prince Harry is valiant; for the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his father, he hath, like lean, ſteril, and bare land, manured, huſbanded, and tilled, with drinking good, and good ſtore of fertile ſherris.—If I had a thouſand ſons, the firſt human prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple I would teach them, ſhould be—To forſwear thin potations, and to addict themſelves to ſack.</p>

                     <p>ROMANS, Countrymen, and Lovers!—hear me for my cauſe, and be ſilent, that you may hear. Believe me for mine honor; and have reſpect to mine honor, that you may believe. Cenſure me in your wiſdom; and awake your ſenſes, that you may the better judge.—If there be any in this aſſembly, any dear friend of Caeſar's, to him I ſay, that Brutus's love to Caeſar was no leſs than his. If, then, that friend demand why Brutus roſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Caeſar this is my anſwer; Not that I loved Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar leſs, but that I loved Rome more. Had you rather Caeſar were living, and die all ſlaves; than that Caeſar were dead, to live all free men?—As Caeſar loved me, I weep for him; as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it: as he was valiant, I honor him; but, as he was ambitious, I ſlew him. There are tears for his love, joy for his fortune, honor for his valour, and death for his ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—Who's here ſo baſe, that would be a bondman? if any, ſpeak; for him have I offended. Who's here ſo rude, that would not be a Roman? if any, ſpeak; for him have I offended. Who's here ſo vile, that will not love his country? if any, ſpeak; for him have I offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.—I pauſe for a reply—</p>
                     <p>None! Then none have I offended.—I have done no more to Caeſar than you ſhall do to Brutus. The queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his death is enrolled in the capitol; his glory not extenuated, wherein he was worthy; nor his offences enforced, for which he ſuffered death.</p>
                     <p>Here comes his body, mourn'd by Mark Antony, who, though he had no hand in his death, ſhall receive the benefit of his dying, a place in the commonwealth; as which of you ſhall not? With thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="7">7. I have always preferred cheerfulneſs to mirth. The latter I conſider as an act, the former as a habit of the mind. Mirth is ſhort and tranſient, cheerfulneſs fixed and permanent. Thoſe are often raiſed into the greateſt tranſports of mirth, who are ſubject to the greateſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of melancholy: on the contrary, cheerfulneſs, though it does not give the mind ſuch an exquiſite glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, prevents us from falling into any depths of ſorrows. Mirth is like a flaſh of lightning, that breaks through a gloom of clouds, and glitters for a moment; cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs keeps up a kind of day-light in the mind, and fills it with a ſteady and perpetual ſerenity.

At the ſame time that I think diſcretion the moſt uſeful talent a man can be maſter of, I look upon cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to be the accompliſhment of little, mean, ungene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous minds. Diſcretion points out the nobleſt ends to us, and purſues the moſt proper and laudable methods of attaining them; cunning has only private ſelfiſh aims, and ſticks at nothing which may make them ſucceed; diſcretion has large and extended views, and, like a well-formed eye, commands a whole horizon; cunning is a kind of ſhort-ſightedneſs, that diſcovers the minu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt objects which are near at hand, but is not able to diſcern things at a diſtance.

As there is a worldly happineſs, which God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives to be no other than diſguiſed miſery; as there are worldly honors, which, in his eſtimation, are reproach: ſo there is a worldly wiſdom, which in his ſight, is fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs.

It produces good-nature and mutual benevolence, encourages the timorous, ſooths the turbulent, humaniſes the fierce, and diſtinguiſhes a ſociety of civilized perſons from a confuſion of ſavages. In a word, complaiſance is a virtue that blends all orders of men together in a friendly intercourſe of words and actions, and is ſuited to that equality in human nature which every one ought to conſider ſo far as is conſiſtent with the order and oeconomy of the world.
