            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>HIS Honor the</hi> GOVERNOR <hi>having received several undoubted Assurances of the sincere and hearty Dispositions of the</hi> Catawba, <hi>and</hi> Cherokee Indians <hi>towards His</hi> Britannic <hi>Majesty's Subjects in general, and this Colony in particular, and considered the great Importance of securing those war like Nations to our Interest at this perilous Juncture, when the</hi> French <hi>are laboring to seduce them from their Fidelity to us, was pleased to propose in Council the Sixth of</hi> November <hi>last, That proper Commissioners should be sent as soon as possible to those</hi> Indians <hi>with an handsome Present, and to conclude a firm and permanent League with them. Whereupon the Council judging that no better Use could be made of Part of the Money His Majesty had been graciously pleased to advance and send to his Honor for the general Service, unanimously agreed thereto. And</hi> PETER RANDOLPH <hi>and</hi> WILLIAM BYRD, <hi>Esquires, being nominated and approved of as Gentlemen perfectly well qualified to conduct and carry into Execution the proposed Treaties; they, in Consequence thereof, having received his Honor's Letter, with his Commission, and Instructions, and Speeches to the Chiefs of the said Nations, proceeded immediately on their Journey, and concluded the Treaties and Engagements, which are presented to the Public in the following Sheets.</hi>

               <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>"INCLOSED you have your Commission, my two SPEECHES to the <hi>Catawbas</hi> and <hi>Cherokees,</hi> with some Instructions for you which are but short, as I have a great Dependence on your known Capacity and Understanding; I think proper to give you a few Hints which may be of Service in your Negotiations with those People.—You will first meet with the King and great Men of the <hi>Catawbas;</hi> after the Council is met and Ceremonies of Reception over, you are first to read your Commission, after that (as the Custom of the <hi>Indians</hi> is) you are to tell them their Brother, the Governor of <hi>Virginia,</hi> is going to speak to them; then read my Speech; as they are tedious in their Councils they probably will require some Time to answer it. You are to take all possible Care to convince them of our Regard and Love for them; let your Treaty with them be offensive and defensive, which must be committed to Writing, and signed by all the Chiefs present, and the Counter-Part by you in Behalf of this Colony Endeavour to get them to mention the Number of Warriors they may agree to supply us with, and the Place they will march them into our Country, when we may have Occasion for their Assistance; and by what Message we are to give them Notice to come in to join our Forces, that we may provide for their Reception: If they should intimate any Expectations of being paid for the Men they may send in
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:007689_0004_102D99AFE8291508"/>
to our Assistance, you may come into such Terms as you may think reasonable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but if they do not mention any Thing of that Nature, you may assure them of being properly taken Care of.—Do all you can to raise their Resentment against the <hi>French</hi> and their <hi>Indians,</hi> and that they may discourage and hinder their coming into their Nation.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Catawbas,</hi> I hear, have long complained of being much confined by the <hi>English</hi> settling on their Land, that they wanted to sell their Land, and go further to the <hi>Westward;</hi> if they mention any Thing of this, you may assure them I shall do every Thing in my Power with the Neighbouring Governors for their Service. You will have Occasion to go thro' the forementioned Ceremonies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with the <hi>Cherokees;</hi> but you are to consider them as a much more numerous Nation, and their Lands very extensive: The <hi>French</hi> have been endeavouring for many Years to bring them over to their Interest, and to build Forts in the Upper <hi>Cherokee</hi> Country, but I hope they have not as yet built them; if they have, endeavour to prevail with the <hi>Indians</hi> to destroy them, and by no Means to allow them any Settlement in their Nation; and if possible, to hinder any of the <hi>French</hi> or their <hi>Indians,</hi> having any Consultations with them, unless they bring a Certificate or Message by one of the <hi>Six Nations</hi> or their Brothers the <hi>English,</hi> otherways they will endeavour to deceive them.—Persuade them to take great Care of the Passes over the Mountains to the Upper <hi>Cherokees,</hi> to prevent any Surprize. Make an Excuse for not sending them some Arms, let them know they were not to be had here, but we will endeavour to provide some for them; you will find the Traders from <hi>South-Carolina,</hi> will do all they can to harrass you in your Treaty.—There is one <hi>Smith,</hi> a Native of this Country, and a Trader from <hi>Charles-Town,</hi> he bears a good Character, you may send for him, he probably may be of Service to you. Be sure to return the <hi>Cherokees</hi> hearty Thanks for the Men they sent in with Mr. <hi>Paris</hi> to our Assistance against the <hi>Shawnese.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AS many Things may occur in the Course of your Negotiations, that I cannot foresee, your own good Sense must be your Guide, and I accordingly refer it entirely to you. The Attorney-General brings you the £. 250 you wrote for. I am greatly disappointed in Wampum, having wrote to Col. <hi>Hunter</hi> to bring me a Quantity, but he is not returned; I think you wrote me Col. <hi>Eaton</hi> would supply you, he will let you know the Quantity necessary.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vii" facs="unknown:007689_0005_102D99B4EFAF5238"/>
INCLOSED you have Invoice of Goods for a Present, packed up and directed for each Nation; and I hope, if the Weather permits, to send them from this on <hi>Monday</hi> or <hi>Tuesday</hi> next, for <hi>Petersburg.</hi> The ten Pieces of <hi>Dutch</hi> Blanketing from Mr. <hi>Turnbull,</hi> are for the <hi>Cherokees,</hi> and if there be any Thing wanting, have it from him, and desire him to send me the Account.—As the <hi>Cherokees</hi> are by Report ten to one of the <hi>Catawbas,</hi> I have proportioned the Powder and Lead accordingly, which you may alter if you see proper.—Two <hi>Cherokee</hi> Boys, who were taken Prisoners by the <hi>Northern-Indians,</hi> were retaken by a Company of our Rangers; I ordered them back to their Nation, pray enquire about them.</p>
            <p>SINCE writing the above, I have a Letter from Mr. <hi>Dobbs,</hi> Governor of <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Carolina,</hi> he appoints two Commissioners to go to the <hi>Catawbas</hi> and <hi>Cherokees<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> he proposes their meeting you at a Place, I think he calls it <hi>Salisbury,</hi> which he says is near the <hi>Indian</hi>-Road, which Rout he supposes you will take.—I wrote him, I believed you would set out from this the 4th or 6th of <hi>January.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF I have omitted any Thing as Hints for your Conduct, please send me Word and I shall answer you.—That you may have your Health, Success in your Negotiations, and a safe Return, is the sincere Wish of,</p>

            <head>INSTRUCTIONS, for PETER RANDOLPH and WILLIAM BYRD, Esquires, appointed Commissioners to treat on Behalf of the Colony and Dominion of Virginia, with the Catawbas and Cherokees.</head>
            <p n="1">I. YOU shall hold yourselves in Readiness to set forward to the Place of Treaty pursuant to your Commission in order to arrive at the <hi>Catawba</hi> and <hi>Cherokee</hi> Nations of <hi>Indians,</hi> with all due Speed, and being there arrived, you shall with all proper Dispatch convene the Chiefs of the said Nations, and having adjusted the necessary Forms and Ceremonies, you are at the first general and public Conference to accquaint the <hi>Indians</hi> that you are come purposely to assure them of the kind and friendly Dispositions of the Inhabitants of this Colony towards them, as well as of the Care that has been taken on their Part, to preserve the most perfect Harmony, and good Understanding with their ancient Friends of those Nations in particular, and in general with all others with whom they have ever made Friendship and Alliance. You are then to compliment them on their steady Adherence, and to desire of them to concur with you in establishing, and perpetuating for all future Time, an immovable Friendship with their Brethren whom you represent.</p>
            <p n="2">II. YOU are then to present my Speech to them, and proceed to acquaint them with the Present you are charged with for them, and to enlarge on the Kindness and Friendship it expresses towards them and this will lead you to magnify the Grandeur and Munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of the King, after which you are in the most affecting Manner to present the Particulars as directed.</p>
            <p n="3">III. HAVING thus and by whatever other Means the Time and Circumstances shall suggest, introduced yourselves to the Favor of the <hi>Indians,</hi> you are to animate them against the unjust Disturbances given to the Peace of Mankind by the restless and insatiate Thirst of Dominion, which is ever actuating the <hi>French</hi> to covet and encroach upon the Possessions of not only the <hi>English,</hi> but all the <hi>Indian</hi> Nations in <hi>America.</hi> To
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:007689_0008_102D99BBCD681548"/>
this End you will acquaint them with their Breach of Faith, and the unprovoked Rapines and Murders committed by them on the Frontier Inhabitants of the Colonies in Time of Tranquility and Peace; and let them know that they have prevailed on the <hi>Delawares</hi> and <hi>Shawnese,</hi> to do Mischief when they pretended to be our Friends. After having duly represented these Perfidies and Violences, you are to acquaint them that the <hi>Six Nations</hi> have joined us against the <hi>French,</hi> and to desire their Assistance, and to agree on some Distinction or Signal whereby the <hi>Catawbas</hi> and <hi>Cherokees,</hi> may be distinguished from other <hi>Indians,</hi> when they come into our Inhabitants, and to know what Number of Men they will furnish, and when.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. YOU are to inform yourselves particularly, what <hi>Indian</hi> Nations they can bring into our Alliance, and what Settlements the <hi>French<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> have made in their Neighbourhood, their Extent, Strength, and at what Period of Time they were made. And you are to endeavour to make yourselves acquainted with the Arts made Use of by the <hi>French</hi> to alienate the Affections of <hi>Indians</hi> from the <hi>English.</hi> You are to exhort them not to be drawn away by deceitful empty Speeches, the peculiar Talent of that cunning People, nor to suffer them on any Pretence whatsoever, to erect any Fort in their Country. But in every Attempt that shall be made to shake their Duty to our common Father, let them consider what real Acts of Friendship have been done them by the <hi>English,</hi> and what by the <hi>French;</hi> let them weigh these Things well in their Minds, and then determine who best deserves their Esteem and Regard; for it is not by vain unmeaning Words that true Friendship is to be discovered, but by its Effects.</p>
            <p n="5">V. WHATEVER Treaty you shall enter into with either of these Nations, you are to take special Care to have it signed by all the Sachems or Chiefs who shall be present at it.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. IF any Thing incidentally occur in the Negotiation not particularly taken Notice of by these Instructions, you are to conduct yourselves in such Manner, as the Nature and Expediency of the Subject Matter, Time and Place may require, according to the best of your Discretion.</p>
            <p>I WISH you Success in your Negotiations, an agreeable Journey, and a safe Return—And I am,</p>

            <p>THIS will be delivered you by the Honorable PETER RANDOLPH and WILLIAM BYRD, Esquires, two of His Majesty's Council of this Dominion, who will shake Hands with you, and are come this long and tedious Journey to assure you of our real Friendship and Love for you; they have my Commission to treat with you, and to brighten and strengthen the Chain of Friendship that has so long subsisted between you and your Brothers the <hi>English;</hi> and am in great Hopes the Treaty you are to make with the above Gentlemen in Behalf of this Dominion in particular, and all the <hi>English</hi> Inhabitants on this Continent, will continue as long as the Sun gives Light.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>French,</hi> by their Emissaries are endeavouring all in their Power to gain over our friendly <hi>Indians</hi> to their Interest, I therefore advise you to be on your Guard against their invidious Insinuations, for their Speeches consist of Falsehoods and unjust Reports. The <hi>Six Nations</hi> have taken up the Hatchet against the <hi>French</hi> and their <hi>Indians,</hi> and have joined our Forces to drive the <hi>French</hi> from the Lands they have unjustly invaded, and have lately given them a remarkable Defeat, killed many of their People and taken several of their great Officers Prisoners; and I hope next Year they will be able to confine them to the barren Lands of <hi>Canada.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LATELY many of the <hi>French</hi> joined with the <hi>Shawnese</hi> came into our Country, robbed and murdered many of our Brethern: Our Friends and Brothers the <hi>Cherokees,</hi> knowing the Truth thereof, immediately took up the Hatchet against the <hi>French</hi> and
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:007689_0010_102D99C183E5F490"/>
               <hi>Shawnese,</hi> and sent into our Country a Number of their Warriors to protect our Frontiers, and to war against those perfidious People.—And I hope Brothers you will also take up the Hatchet, against the <hi>French</hi> and their <hi>Indians;</hi> and as I have great Reason to expect many of the <hi>Cherokee</hi> Warriors on any Occasion, to go to War against your Enemies and ours, I therefore hope you will also assist with a Number of your brave Warriors.</p>
            <p>THE Commissioners will also deliver you a Present sent from our Father the Great King, and this Dominion, to assure you of our Sincerity to continue in true Friendship with the <hi>Catawbas.</hi> Whatever the Commissioners tell you, you are to believe as spoke by myself, and I am in hopes you will conclude with them a Treaty of Peace and Friendship which may continue as long as the Rivers run and Trees grow, which will be confirmed by me, and transmitted to our Father the other Side of the great Water.</p>
            <p>MAY you live long, and that we may always act with true Friendship for each other, is my sincere Wish.</p>

            <p>At the Catawba-Town, the 20th of February, 1756. PRESENT.
<list>
                  <item>The Honorable PETER RANDOLPH, and WILLIAM BYRD, Esquires, Commissioners for Virginia.</item>
                  <item>THOMAS ADAMS, Esquire, Secretary.</item>
                  <item>HEIGLER, King of the Catawbas, and all the Sachems and Warriors of that Nation.</item>
                  <item>WILLIAM GILES, Interpreter.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The Commissioners having first produced their Deputation, and the same being read and interpreted, they spoke as followeth:</p>
            <p>Brethren, King, Sachems, and Warriors, of the Great CATAWBA Nation,</p>
            <p>"OUR common Father, the Great King of <hi>England,</hi> has been pleased to direct your Brother, the Governor of <hi>Virginia,</hi> to send Commissioners hither, to assure you of his Affection, and to present you with as many Goods in Token thereof as it was convenient to send so far, at this Season of the Year. It was his Pleasure to appoint us to that Charge, and at the same Time, to direct us to deliver you a Speech in his Name, with a Belt of Wampum, which we are now ready to do, and hope you will be attentive thereto."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:007689_0014_102D724870BA22E8"/>
To which King Heigler answered.</p>
            <p>"WE shall always listen to every Thing that comes from our Brothers of <hi>Virginia</hi> with great Attention, and are now prepared to hear whatever you may be directed to say to us in the Name of the Governor of that Colony."</p>
            <p>The Secretary then proceeded to read the Governor's Speech, which was interpreted.</p>
            <p>(<hi>See the</hi> GOVERNOR'<hi>s</hi> SPEECH, <hi>Page</hi> xi.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Upon which the</hi> Indians <hi>gave the</hi> YO-HAH.</p>
            <p>Then the Commissioners spoke as follows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brothers and Friends,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"YOU have heard his Honor the Governor of <hi>Virginia'</hi>s Speech, wherein he has confirmed what we just now told you, that we are sent here to represent him and the Colony under his Command, in order to brighten the Chain, and strengthen the Friendship, which has subsisted between you and them, since a much earlier Time than our oldest Men can remember. It is not Brethern in Behalf of <hi>Virginia</hi> alone, that we have come so far to tell you, how highly we value and commend your steady Friendship to the great King <hi>George,</hi> and his Children in <hi>Virginia,</hi> but of all his Subjects in <hi>America,</hi> who have ever held you in high Esteem, having always found you our faithful Friends, and make no Doubt but that you will continue such to all future Time. To convince you of our great Dependence upon your unshaken Love, we present you with this String of Wampum."</p>
            <p>"YOU cannot be Strangers, brave CATAWBAS, to the late unjustifiable Steps taken by the <hi>French,</hi> that crafty Enemy of all Mankind, to debauch the Principles and poison the Minds of not only the <hi>Indians,</hi> but of all other Nations, who are in Alliance with the great King our Father. They are a People, Brothers, whose Thirst of Power is so great, that nothing but an intire Reduction of the whole World to their Subjection, can satisfy their boundless Ambition. By their dark Measures, and deceitful Practices, they have so far unhappily succeeded, as to prevail on the <hi>Shawnese</hi> and <hi>Delaware Indians,</hi> to make Incursions on the Frontiers of <hi>Virginia, Maryland,</hi> and <hi>Pennsylania,</hi> to murder in the most inhuman Manner, defenceless Husbandmen at their Labor, weak Women in their Beds, with their tender Infants at their Breasts, resting secure in their own Innocence in Time
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:007689_0015_102D99C8422D1D18"/>
of a settled Peace. And thus those Nations continue still to act in open Violation of a solemn Treaty concluded on at <hi>Loggs-</hi>Town, about three Years past, between our Commissioners and their Chiefs.</p>
            <p>"OUR Friends the <hi>Six Nations</hi> concerned for the Misfortunes of their Brethern, and enraged that the <hi>French</hi> and their <hi>Indians</hi> pay so little Regard to their Engagements, have taken up the Hatchet against them, and joined General <hi>Johnson</hi> last Fall, on Lake St. <hi>Sacrament,</hi> where after a bloody Battle, it pleased the Great God, to bless our Arms with Victory, and to enable our Men to destroy the greatest Part of their Enemies, to captivate their General, and slay many of their commanding Officers. To confirm the Truth of what we have told you, we give you this String of Wampum.</p>
            <p>"WE are desired by the Governor of <hi>Virginia,</hi> to inform you, That we now stand in need of your Assistance; and from the many Instances of your Friendship, we hope you will join our Forces with such a Number of Warriors, as you think you may with Safety to yourselves spare, whenever there may be Occasion for them, of which you shall have due Notice.</p>
            <p>"YOUR Compliance with this Request will give us an Opportunity of representing to the King your Father, your Readiness to defend His Dominions, on this Side the great Water. And that you may be encouraged to march against the Enemy, with greater Chearfulness, we promise you that your Men shall be supplied with Arms, Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and every Thing necessary for War. To confirm the Truth of what we have said, and to enforce our Request, we give you this Belt of Wampum."</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Upon which the</hi> Indians <hi>gave the usual Cry of Approbation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>KING <hi>Heigler,</hi> then repeated the Substance of what had been said, and that there might be no Mistakes, desired the Interpreter to attend him and his Chiefs in a Council that Evening, and at the same Time told the Commissioners that he proposed to give them an Answer in the Morning.</p>

            <p>King HEIGLER spoke as follows,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brothers and Friends,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"AT the Request of my Brother the Governor of <hi>Virginia,</hi> I made him a Visit last Year. After much Talk with him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which I have treasured up in my Breast, and hope he has done the same, he told me that he did not then want my Assistance, but desired that I would hold my Warriors in Readiness, not doubting, but that he should have Occasion for them soon. It was at the repeated Requests of the <hi>Northern</hi> Governors, that we concluded a Peace with their <hi>Indians,</hi> which we have hitherto strictly observed. But as the <hi>Shawnese</hi> and <hi>Delawares,</hi> have broke the Chain of Friendship, between them and our Brethern the <hi>English,</hi> we think ourselves bound in Gratitude to declare them our Enemies, and shall immediately take up the Hatchet against them, and you may be assured, never lay it down 'til we have sufficiently revenged the Blood of our Friends. We have always been supplied, with Cloaths, Guns and Ammunition, by the Great King, on the other Side of the Water, and have the most grateful Remembrance of his Kindness to us, which has link'd us to his Interest with a Chain stronger than Iron. Our Warriors delight in War, and our young Men are equally pleased that they have an Opportunity of going to Battle. It is my Resolution to lead them on whenever the Governor of <hi>Virginia</hi> thinks proper.</p>
            <p>"WE are in perfect Amity with the <hi>Cherokees, Cowetaws</hi> and <hi>Chickasaws.</hi> The <hi>Cherokees</hi> have ever been our Friends, and as they are a numerous Nation, we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge them to be our elder Brother.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:007689_0017_102D99CD2DD4AA80"/>
"WE hope they will shew a good Example by sending a great Number of their Warriors to join us and our Brethern of <hi>Virginia</hi> against the <hi>French</hi> and their <hi>Indian</hi> Allies."</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gave a Belt of Wampum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>KING <hi>Heigler,</hi> then desired his Warriors to speak for themselves, upon which <hi>Prenchee-Uraw,</hi> spoke as followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friends and Brothers,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"I AM a young Man, and have not yet distinguished myself in War<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but I am not a little pleased, that I have an Opportunity of doing it. If I should be so fortunate as to do any Thing that deserves Commendation, I shall have the Thanks of the Great King <hi>George,</hi> and my Brethern the <hi>English.</hi> But whether I am successful or not, my Endeavours shall be such as to convince them of the Integrity of my Intentions."</p>
            <p>Chippapaw, then rose up and spoke as follows,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brothers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"YOU have put a bright Hatchet in our Hands, which we have accepted and hold fast. You have also directed us where to strike it. I am determined, either to dye it in the Blood of our Enemies, or to lose my Life in the Attempt."</p>
            <p>Hixa-Uraw, then spoke to the following Purpose,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brothers,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"I HAVE listened attentively to what the King and Warriors have said. Their Readiness in complying with your Request, has given me great Pleasure, and as I have Feet as well as they, I shall not stay at Home, if they are able to support me."</p>
            <p>THE other Warriors present said that the King and those who had already spoken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had expressed their Sentiments, and that they were ready whenever they were called on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to hazard their Lives in Defence of their Brethern the <hi>English.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Commissioners immediately made the following Reply,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brethern,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"YOUR Answer has given us great Satisfaction, and we doubt not, but that, by your future Actions, you will approve yourselves to be that brave People your Brethern the <hi>English,</hi> have ever esteemed you.</p>
            <p>"WE have Instructions from our Governor, to desire that you will inform us, what Number of Men you can send to our Assistance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by which Means he will be the better Judge of our Strength. Our Enemies the <hi>French</hi> will undoubtedly exert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:007689_0018_102D7241EB158E68"/>
to carry their Schemes into Execution, and therefore it is the more necessary we should act with Vigor and Unanimity. That there may be no Misapprehensions, we have prepared an Instrument of Writing, containing Six Articles, to be signed by us in Behalf of the Colony we represent, and by your King and Sachems in Behalf of your Nation. We shall leave them with you for your Consideration, and when they have been interpreted to you, and you have in Council consulted your People, we hope they will meet with your Approbation.</p>
            <p>"WE have left a Blank for the Number of Men, with which you are to supply us, which, we flatter ourselves, will be so great, as to be of real Service to us, and demonstrate your Zeal for our common Defence.</p>
            <p>"THE Goods, we have before-mentioned to you, are now exposed to your View, and whenever it is agreeable to you, you may proceed to divide them among you."</p>
            <p>THE Commissioners then withdrew, and the King and Sachems after a short Consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, desired them to return, and after being again seated, King <hi>He<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ler</hi> spoke as follows,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brethren,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"WE have had the Articles proposed to us under our Consideration, and we entirely approve of them. A great Number of our Warriors being now in the Woods, we can only venture to assure you of Forty Men, altho' it is more than probable, that we shall send double that Number. But that we may preserve the Reputation of a steady faithful People, we will engage for nothing more than we can with the greatest Certainly comply with. We have seen the Goods and accept them as a Token of your Affection, which we hope you will deservedly continue to us so long as the World exists."</p>
            <p>THE Articles were then again read, and signed by the Commissioners, the King, and Warriors of the CATAWBA Nation respectively. After which the <hi>Indians</hi> expressed great Satisfaction, and the Commissioners calling for Wine and Punch, drank, <hi>Health to the Great King</hi> GEORGE <hi>and the</hi> CATAWBA <hi>Nation;</hi> which put an End to the Treaty.</p>

            <p>The Commissioners spoke as follows,</p>
            <p>Brethren, Sachems, and Warriors of the great and powerful Nation of CHEROKEES,</p>
            <p>"THE Governor of <hi>Virginia,</hi> having by his Commission under the Great-Seal of that Colony, deputed us to visit you our Brethern, in order to consult you on some Affairs, in which our Interests are mutually concerned; we heartily bid you welcome.—We have waited a long Time for your coming, but we presume, from the remote Situation of many of your Towns, that your Sachems could not be convened sooner, and therefore we the more chearfully acquiesce under the many Inconveniences we have been subjected to thro' your Delay. You could not have given us a greater Evidence of your Esteem, than by your meeting us so much lower-down than the Place you first appointed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Badness of the Roads, which are almost impassable for Waggons, and the Scarcity of Corn, having made our Journey both tedious and expensive. We are first to deliver you a Speech, in the Name of our Governor, with a Belt of Wampum, which we hope you'll hear with Attention, and that it will have that Influence on you, which he expects."</p>
            <p>The Secretary then read the Governor's Speech, which was interpreted.</p>
            <p>(<hi>See the</hi> GOVERNOR'<hi>s</hi> SPEECH, <hi>Page</hi> xii.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Upon which the</hi> Indians <hi>gave the</hi> YO-HAH.</p>
            <p>Then the Commissioners spoke as follows.</p>
            <p>"AS you are now acquainted with the Intention of our undertaking this long and fatiguing Journey, permit us to assure you of our Readiness to concur in brightening
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:007689_0023_102D99DA735D6A00"/>
and strengthening the Chain of Friendship which has hitherto remained unviolated, and which we on our Parts shall endeavour to preserve unshaken, so long as the Sun and Moon shall endure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brethern,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"YOUR Fidelity and steady Adherence to the Interest of the <hi>English,</hi> of which the sending your Warriors to the Assistance of your Brethern the <hi>Virginians</hi> is a recent Instance, have had such an happy Influence upon the King your Father, that He always disposed to reward his dutiful Children, has ordered a Present of Goods to be sent to you. And in Obedience to His Majesty's Commands, we were immediately dispatched with them, and they are now ready for your Acceptance. We are sorry to tell you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that altho' your Brother the Governor of <hi>Virginia,</hi> spared no Pains in purchasing the most suitable Goods for you, yet he could by no Means procure a sufficient Number of such fire Arms, as would be acceptable to you. We have however his Permission to assure you, that you shall be supplied with them hereafter.—In Confirmation whereof we give you this String of Wampum.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brethern,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"YOU have undoubtedly heard that many skulking Parties of <hi>Indians,</hi> prompted thereto by our treacherous and most perfidious Enemies the <hi>French,</hi> have made Incursions upon our Frontiers, murdering and captivating all the Men, Women and Children, who were so unhappy as to fall into their Way. The <hi>Indians</hi> principally concerned in this Bloodshed, are the <hi>Shawnese</hi> and <hi>Delawares,</hi> who delighting in Blood, and not observing the most solemn Treaties, at which they have always had a large Share of the Royal Bounty, have by the Cunning and Artifice of the <hi>French,</hi> been withdrawn from their Allegiance to the Great King, the Father of us all; and prevailed on take up the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Hatchet against his Children. Thus the <hi>French,</hi> contrary to the Law of Nature and Nations, are for ever pushing on our own Allies to destroy us, and what may we not all expect, if we do not vigorously unite to frustrate their wicked Designs. The Frontier Inhabitants of the <hi>Northern</hi> Colonies have been as yet the only Victims of their Fury, but be assured, Brethern, that unless you take the necessary Steps to prevent it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you will likewise be involved in the same Calamity. That we may never be again exposed to the Treachery and Deceit of those cruel Savages, we have resolved to cut them off from the Race of Mankind, and we do in Behalf of the People we represent, return you our sincere and unfeigned Thanks for your kind and friendly Assistance, in the Execution of that Design.</p>

               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:007689_0024_102D99DD4D731D80"/>
               <hi>Brethren,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"THE <hi>French,</hi> who have nothing less in View than universal Monarchy, and are for ever encroaching upon the Lands of not only the <hi>English,</hi> but of all the <hi>Indian</hi> Nations in <hi>America,</hi> have built Forts upon our Lands: And the better to support their ambitious Views, they have used every Artifice in their Power to win the <hi>Six Nations</hi> to their Interest. But they detesting their perfidious Practices, and being by dear-bought Experience convinced, how little their Promises are to be regarded, would not be deluded by their fallacious Speeches, but taking up the Hatchet against them and their <hi>Indians,</hi> joined our forces to the <hi>Northward</hi> with a great Number of their Warriors, where our Army under the Command of General <hi>Johnson,</hi> obtained a complete Victory over them.—In Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony whereof we give you this Belt of Wampum.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brethren,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"REMEMBER how this cruel People usurped the Land of the <hi>Nochees,</hi> and chased them from their Country. Forget not also their Endeavours to destroy the <hi>Chickasaws,</hi> who having timely Notice of their evil Intentions, gave them a brave Repulse. You must have heard of the many Attempts they have made to cut off the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> but they diligently pursuing the most prudent Measures for their Security, have hitherto avoided the fatal Blow. We could enumerate a thousand Instances of their Cruelty, and defy them to point out a single Instance of ours: No, Brethern, on the contrary many Nations of <hi>Indians</hi> reduced by War, and unable to withstand the Torrent of their Enemies, have fled to us for Refuge, and have always found a secure Retreat among us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brethren,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"THE <hi>American</hi> Colonies no longer able to bear the Insults of the <hi>French,</hi> are resolved to unite in revenging the Injuries they have received from that perfidious Nation. And we have the most sanguine Hopes, that you, fired with Indignation at their repeated Acts of Barbarity, and animated with that Spirit, for which the <hi>Cherokees</hi> have been ever remarkable, will not suffer the Blood of your Brothers the <hi>English,</hi> who are always ready to sacrifice their Lives and Fortunes in your Defence, to remain unrevenged. Wherefore we invite you to follow the Example of the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> by joining not only your own Force with ours, but likewise by calling on all the Nations either in Alliance with you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or depending on you, to assist us. By which Means you will manifest your Duty to the King your Father, and your Love to your Brethren. For that Purpose you shall be
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:007689_0025_102D99DF4AFE2DB0"/>
furnished with Arms and Ammunition, Cloathing and Provision.—In Confirmation whereof, and to enforce our Request, we present you with this Belt of Wampum.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which was received with the usual Cry of Approbation.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Brethren,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"WE have heard, that the <hi>French</hi> have been endeavouring by their false Reports and cunning Insinuations, to alienate your Affections from the <hi>English;</hi> but we have too great Confidence in your Integrity, to suspect that you can be influenced by their deceitful and empty Speeches: And we flatter ourselves, that you will on all Occasions, give us the best and earliest Intelligence, of any Designs that may be formed to our Disadvantage. By such generous and candid Behaviour, you will not only establish a Friendship with us upon a lasting and permanent Foundation, but also merit the Esteem of the King your Father, who never fails to feed his dutiful Children when they are hungry, and cloath them when they are naked.—In Pledge of the Truth of what we have spoken, and of our Inclination to live and die with you, we give you this Belt of Wampum.</p>

               <hi>Brethren,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"IT gives us Concern to hear that you should suspect your Friend <hi>Richard Smith,</hi> of endeavouring to prevail on us, to leave Part of the Goods designed for you at the <hi>Catawbas,</hi> by insinuating that you were not a People worthy of a large Present. We assure you, that the Report is without the least Foundation, and that if he had attempted to lessen you in our Esteem, we should have treated him with the greatest Disdain. Your Brethren<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of <hi>Virginia,</hi> truly sensible of your inviolable Attachmment to the Interest of the <hi>English,</hi> have taken every Opportunity of giving you Demonstrations of their Affection. The Present indeed is not so large, as we could wish, for the Reason already mentioned, that the most material Articles, were not to be had in our Colony. To remove these Jealousies for the future, we would fain have you send some of your Boys to <hi>Virginia,</hi> where we have a School erected for their Education. We promise you that all due Care shall be taken of them, both with Respect to their Cloaths and Learning. When they come to be Men, they will be acquainted with the Manners and Customs of us both, and our Children will naturally place such a Confidence in them, as to employ them in settling any Disputes that may hereafter arise.—In Token of the Sincerity of our Intentions, and of our great Desire, that you should accept of our Invitation, we give you this Belt of Wampum."</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Brothers,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"THIS Day is appointed from above, for our Meeting, and I rejoice in seeing our eldest Brothers the <hi>Virginians</hi> here; and that we may give you the earliest Assurance of our Affection for you, I present you with this String of Wampum. I have been in <hi>England,</hi> and have seen the Great King, you have so often had Occasion to mention. He then acknowledged the <hi>Cherokees</hi> to be his Children, as well as the <hi>English,</hi> and desired that we might continue Brethren for ever. I shall always remember my Father's Commands, and shall whenever I have an Opportunity, give the strongest Demonstrations of my Readiness to obey them. It gives me the greatest Concern to hear of the horrid Murders committed by the <hi>Indians</hi> on the Frontier Inhabitants of <hi>Virginia,</hi> and our Endeavours shall not be wanting, to prevent such Massacres for the future; altho' I must tell you that all our People, who, by their Situation, can be most useful on this Occasion, live in the upper Towns, who are as much exposed to the Incursions of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> as your Frontier Inhabitants; and unless we have a Fort built for the Protection of our Wives and Children, in the Absence of our
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:007689_0027_102D99E72DB62600"/>
Warriors, it will not be safe for us to leave them. We have had frequent Promises from the Governor of <hi>South-Carolina,</hi> to build us a Fort; and it was stipulated, at a Treaty held at <hi>Saludy</hi> last Summer, when we signed a Release for our Lands to the Great King <hi>George:</hi> But we do not find, that that Governor has yet made the least Preparations towards performing his Engagement. Wherefore, we are sorry to tell you, that we don't much rely on him. The King our Father told me, that we should mutually assist each other, and therefore, as we are unacquainted with the Manner of building Forts, and had not the necessary Materials, we thought ourselves justifiable in making our Application to Governor <hi>Glen,</hi> who, I must again repeat it, has forfeited his Word, I have a Hatchet ready, but we hope our Friends will not expect us to take it up, 'til we have a Place of Safety for our Wives and Children. When they are secure, we will immediately send a great Number of Warriors to be employed by your Governor, where he shall think proper. I have given a true State of the Condition of our Country, and desire you will make a true Representation of our Situation to your Governor, and at the same Time tell him, that if no Steps are taken for our Security, the <hi>French</hi> will extinguish the friendly Fire between us: If he should have any Message to send to us hereafter, or should think it expedient to send Commissioners again to us, we desire they may come the <hi>Northward</hi> Path, it being the nearest. As it is a very dangerous Way, we need not recommend it to him to send a strong Guard. Our Governor is old and infirm, and can by no Means cross the Mountains, to meet you on the <hi>Southern</hi> Path, but I am instructed to tell you, that he will on any Occasion meet you at <hi>Stalnacker'</hi>s, and he hopes that the Governor of <hi>Virginia,</hi> will not refuse him a Meeting there. To convince you of our Attachment to your Interest, and to enforce our Request, we give you this String of Wampum.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brothers,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"IT gives us Concern to find, that for so many Years our Brethren of <hi>Virginia,</hi> have declined a Trade with us. The King our Father, when I was in <hi>England,</hi> assured me that we should constantly be supplied with Goods; but we have hitherto found it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. We tell you this, in hopes that when your Governor knows it, he will give proper Encourgagement to some of his People to open a Trade with us. You perceive the Nakedness of our People, and are very sensible, that we are unable to make any Thing but Bows and Arrows for our Defence; they are but bad Weapons, compared with Guns which kill at a great Distance. The <hi>French</hi> supply their <hi>Indians</hi> with the best of Fire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:007689_0028_102D99E9A0BE33C0"/>
Arms, and in that they have the Advantage of us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore we again repeat our Request to you, to begin a Trade with us, which we hope will be to our mutual Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.—To enforce our Request we present you with these Skins.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brethren,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"OUR Governor gave us a particular Charge to let you know our Wants, and at the same Time to assure you, that the Path shall be cleared for your Traders, in such a Manner, as that it shall never wear out. He also directed us to desire that you will trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this Treaty to the Great King on the other Side the Water, who, we doubt not, is quite ignorant of our Circumstances, and will relieve us as soon as he is acquainted with them. To remind you of this Request we give you these Skins."</p>
            <p>Cunnetalogo, then rose up and spoke as follows,</p>
            <p>"I am sent a Messenger by the Governor of our Nation, with this Belt of Wampum, to acquaint you of his Infirmities, and that he could not possibly cross the Mountains, but that if the Governor of <hi>Virginia,</hi> should hereafter think proper to have a Meeting with him, he could very conveniently come to <hi>Stalnaker'</hi>s. He also desired me to inform you that he thought himself in great Danger, and that he could not possibly send out any Warriors to your Assistance, 'til he had a Place of Security, in their Absence, for their Wives and Children; he therefore hopes that Men will be sent immediately to erect a Fort. I am also directed to acquaint you, that the Trade we have with <hi>Carolina,</hi> is not sufficient to supply us with Necessaries, which you may judge from our Nakedness. I do in our Governor's Name entreat you, to represent our Condition to your Governor, who, we make no doubt, when he is informed of our Poverty, from the Mouths of Men he can rely on, will send Traders to us. We will open the Path and keep it clear.</p>

            <p>The Commissioners spoke as follows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brethren,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"WE are much pleased at the Satisfaction you expressed Yesterday of seeing and talking with your Brethren of <hi>Virginia.</hi> But at the same Time it gave us no small Concern, to hear from the Mouth of one of your greatest Warriors, who, we press me, spoke the Sentiments of you all, that you are not in a Condition to assist us. You reminded us of our mutual Obligation to assist each other in Case of a War with the <hi>French,</hi> which we acknowledge. And the Treaties for that Purpose gave us the strongest Assurance that you would when called upon join our Forces on the <hi>Ohio,</hi> with at least Five Hundred of your Warriors, which we hoped might be well spared, as your Nation is very numerous. You tell us that your Towns situated on the upper Side of the Mountains, are equally exposed with our Frontier Inhabitants to the Incursions of the <hi>French,</hi> but as we have always heard, that there were only a few Men employed in building the Fort you mention, and those at a great Distance from you, we had no Reason to apprehend you to be in immediate Danger. However, as you think otherwise, we must allow, that Self-Defence ought to be first provided for, and therefore, to remove all Objections, we, in Behalf of the Colony of <hi>Virginia,</hi> do engage, that they shall contribute their Proportion of the Expence of building a strong Fort for your Protection; provided, that you in Behalf of your Nation, will contract to supply us with a large Number of your Warriors, when that is compleated; to be marched into any Part of our Colony, upon
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:007689_0030_102D99ECCBCF3950"/>
the first Notice. And in the mean Time, if you can supply us with only Two Hundred Men, you will have the greater Pretensions to the Protection of the King your Father. We are the more solicitous for your Assistance at this Juncture, as there are many <hi>Indians</hi> in the <hi>French</hi> Service, whose Method and Manner of Fighting, you are much better acquainted with, than our People.</p>
            <p>"WE shall faithfully represent every Thing you have said to us to the Governor of <hi>Virginia,</hi> who will transmit this Treaty to the King your Father, and not only use his good Offices with His Majesty in your Behalf, but also his Influence on the Inhabitants of that Colony, to engage them to be Adventurers in a Trade with you.</p>
            <p>"WE have great Hopes, that another Meeting will be quite unnecessary, as we are now invested with a full Power of concluding a Treaty with you, and you may be assured, our Engagements will be punctually performed. If our Proposals meet with your Approbation, it is necessary that we should enter into an Obligation to perform our respective Parts, and we shall prepare a Writing for that Purpose, and send it to you this Evening for your Perusal.</p>
            <p>"WHEN you have considered it and consulted your People, you will then acquaint us with your Thoughts of it, for which Purpose we will attend you early in the Morning, and shall then hope to finish our Business."</p>
            <p>
               <hi>CULLOUGHCULLA</hi> answered, that they were very desirous of bringing the Treaty to a Conclusion, and that they would take the Articles as soon as they were prepared under their immediate Consideration, and be ready to give a final Answer in the Morning.</p>

            <p>"THE Writing you sent us last Night has been interpreted to us, and having duly considered it, we approve of every Thing contained therein, and are now ready on our Part to sign it. We will engage to assist you with Four Hundred Men at least, as soon as the Fort is compleated, and we are not without Hopes, but that we shall then be able to send you double that Number."</p>
            <p>THE Commissioners immediately signed it in Behalf of <hi>Virginia,</hi> and the Sachems in Behalf of their Nation; after which the Sachems by the Invitation of the Commissioners, dined with them, when the Commissioners drank<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> '<hi>The</hi> KING'<hi>s Health, the</hi> Royal Family, <hi>and Success to the</hi> CHEROKEE <hi>Nation,</hi>' and the <hi>Indians</hi> returning the Compliment, drank, '<hi>His</hi> MAJESTY, <hi>the</hi> Royal Family, <hi>and Prosperity to their Brethren the</hi> English.' The <hi>Indians</hi> then retired to their Camp, taking first Leave of the Commissioners and those present, and expressing themselves well pleased with every Thing that had been done.</p>

            <head>His Honor the GOVERNOR was pleased the 12th of April, 1756, to send the following Message to the House of Burgesses.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Mr. Speaker, and Gentlemen of the House of Burgesses,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>"I HAVE thought it proper to communicate to your House, my Commission and Instructions to <hi>Peter Randolph</hi> and <hi>William Byrd,</hi> Esquires, appointed Commissioners, to treat on Behalf of this Government with the <hi>Catawbas</hi> and <hi>Cherokees,</hi> with my Letter to those Gentlemen, containing some Observations which I judged might be of Service in their Negociations with those People, and my two Speeches to the <hi>Catawbas</hi> and <hi>Cherokees.</hi> And to give you all the Satisfaction I am at present capable of, I send you the joint Letter of the Commissioners to me, dated the 17th of last Month. The Treaty I have not yet received, nor expect it before their Return."</p>
            <p>THE said Letter from the Commissioners signified they had that Day concluded their Business with the <hi>Cherokees,</hi> who would by no Means consent to part with any of their Warriors 'til they had a Fort built, for the Protection of their Women and Children in their Absence, but engaged as soon as it was compleated to send four Hundred of their Warriors to our Assistance. That their Sachems would engage for no more, but at the same Time assured them, they might probably send at least a Thousand which there was little Reason to doubt of, as they appear to have a particular Regard for <hi>Virginia.</hi> That it was the Opinion of Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> who is well acquainted with their Situation, that if we should neglect to build the Fort this Summer, they will be under a Necessity of joining
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:007689_0036_102D99FB773A2348"/>
the <hi>French<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> wherefore, they (the Commissioners) had stipulated and promised in Behalf of this Colony, that a Fort should be actually erected in the <hi>Cherokee</hi> Country with all possible Expedition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Upon this the House of Burgesses came to the following Resolutions,</hi> 
               <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Resolved,</hi> THAT a Fort be erected in the Country of the <hi>Cherokees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Resolved,</hi> THAT an humble Address be made to the Governor to desire that his Honor will be pleased to pay for erecting the said Fort out of the Money, which His Majesty was pleased to send to him for the Use of this Colony now remaining in his Hands.</p>
            <p>To which the Governor sent the following Answer.</p>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, and Gentlemen of the House of Burgesses.</p>
            <p>"IN Answer to your Resolve, I am to acquaint you, That since the Conversation between your Committee and myself, concerning the Application of the Ballance remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in my Hands of the Money His Majesty was graciously pleased to send for the Protection of the Colony, I have disbursed several large Sums in the Purchase of Beeves, and other Necessaries for the Forces; however, I will engage to furnish Eight Hundred Pounds towards that necessary Work, the erecting a Fort you have resolved on in the <hi>Cherokee</hi> Country. But I should be glad you would appoint some proper Persons to make an Estimate of the Expence of the Undertaking, that a suitable Provision may be made to go on with the Work with Dispatch and Regularity.</p>
            <p>The House of Burgesses after that Message, came to the following Resolution, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Resolved,</hi> THAT an humble Address be made to the Governor, to desire that his Honor will be pleased to appoint Major <hi>Andrew Lewis,</hi> and Captain <hi>Samuel Overton,</hi> to manage and overlook the Building a Fort in the <hi>Cherokee</hi> Country, and to assure his Honor that this House will make good any Deficiency that the Sum his Honor has been pleased to say he would pay towards erecting the said Fort, shall fall short, so as the same do not exceed Two Thousand Pounds in the whole.</p>

               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:007689_0037_102D9A004C0E6530"/>
TO which his Honor answered, "He was well satisfied with the Resolution of their House, and should appoint Major <hi>Lewis,</hi> to oversee the Construction of the said Fort."</p>
            <p>AND in Consequence thereof, the Governor was pleased to order Major <hi>Lewis,</hi> to march immediately with Sixty Men, Tools, Utensils, and Provisions to <hi>Choto,</hi> in the <hi>Cherokee</hi> Country, for that Service.</p>
