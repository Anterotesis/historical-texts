            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>I AM pretty certain I need not inform my hearers, what is the more particular and ſpecial occaſion of my chuſing this paſſage of holy Scripture for the ſubject of our meditations at this time. So alarming a viſitation of providence, does, I think, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally lead to it, and now claim our particular notice; and the rather, becauſe it has been repeated, even ſo lately as the laſt evening. Tho' there are many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:007487_0004_102b8ef4873e3b98"/>
thro'out the world, ſo thoughtleſs and irreligious as to diſregard the common, ordinary occurrences of divine providence, which are familiar to them; yet there are few, if any, who are arrived at ſuch a pitch of impiety, whoſe conſciences are ſo feared and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened, as not to have their attention awak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s of ſuch unuſual, ſuch ſtriking and ſtupendous events. When God "looketh on the earth, and it trembleth," or "toucheth the hills, and they ſmoke," <note n="†" place="bottom">Pſalm 104.32. It ſeems not improbable that Earthquakes, and the Eruptions of Volcanos, were the Phaenomena which the Pſalmiſt here had in view.</note> even the moſt abandoned men, who are witneſſes of theſe his mighty works, are generally ſtruck with a ſolemn awe, and have their thoughts turned towards the great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, Upholder, and Governor of the univerſe: And whenever they are thus led to think ſeriouſly of Him, they cannot but wiſh themſelves the objects of his favour, and ſhudder under the apprehenſions of his righteous diſpleaſure: They cannot but account his diſpleaſure even worſe than death, and his <q>loving kindneſs better than life.</q>
            </p>
            <p>SUCH ſeaſons and opportunities as the preſent, when the ears and hearts of men may be ſuppoſed more open to diſcipline, ought not, therefore, to be neglected, but carefully improved by thoſe, whoſe particular buſineſs it is to "call ſinners to repentance," and to preach righteouſneſs to the world. They may reaſonably

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re yet too often attempted to be made to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, at other ſeaſons. I believe there is no wicked man amongſt us, tho' it may be juſtly feared there are many to whom this character belongs; I believe there is no wicked man amongſt us, I ſay, whoſe heart did not tremble within his breaſt, when the earth ſo lately trembled under his feet; none, the joynts of whoſe loins were not looſed, and whoſe bones and marrow did not ſeem to be diſſolving, when the very frame of nature, and the foundations of the world were put out of courſe; and all theſe things ſeemed to be diſſolving. For the truth of this, I dare appeal to the moſt profligate, hardened ſinner preſent; even to thoſe, who may have only made a mock of ſin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, not having conſidered, that with God there is terrible majeſty, till He thus cauſed his dread to fall upon them, and his excellency made them afraid.</p>
            <p>MY deſign, therefore, is, by the aſſiſtance and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Him, <q>who worketh all things according to the counſel of his own will,</q> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Eph. i.11.</note> in the kingdom of his providence, and of his grace, to fix, confirm, and cultivate into a principle of ſober, practical religion and piety, thoſe good impreſſions, which, I cannot but hope and believe, have been made upon the hearts of the young and tho'tleſs; and even upon thoſe of the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:007487_0006_102b8fd35dd2a8a8"/>
moſt profane and diſſolute, by this awakening and repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed viſitation of divine providence: Improving it, at the ſame time, for the quickening of good men in their chriſtian courſe, and "the perfecting of the ſaints"; that they may give the more diligence to be found of their Judge in peace at laſt, <q>without ſpot and blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.</q> For we are, I think, naturally led by theſe viſitations and admonitions of providence, to turn our attention to that great period, when we ſhall <q>all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before the judgment-ſeat of Chriſt;</q> and when all theſe things which were, juſt now, only ſhaken, ſhall be intirely diſſolved; and when, not only the earth ſhall be moved out of her place, but the heavens themſelves "ſhall paſs away with a great noiſe." <q>Seeing then that all theſe things ſhall be diſſolved, what manner of perſons ought ye to be in all holy converſation and godlineſs, looking for, and haſting unto, the coming of the day of GOD?</q>—</p>
            <p>IN diſcourſing upon this ſubject, it will be proper to inquire, in the</p>
            <p>FIRST place, what things thoſe are, of which St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks; and all which, he aſſures us, ſhall be diſſolved?</p>
            <p>SECONDLY, what we are to underſtand by the diſſolution of theſe things? And,</p>
            <p>THIRDLY, when this great and intereſting event ſhall come to paſs? or what will be the forerunners, concomitants, and conſequents of it?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:007487_0007_102b848b1f792100"/>FOURTHLY, I ſhall, in conformity to the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal deſign of the paſſage, and the manifeſt ſcope of the apoſtle, urge the certainty hereof as a motive to univerſal holineſs, and, thereby, to prepare for, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten unto, the coming of this Day of God.</p>
            <p>THE ſubject will then be cloſed with ſome appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it, relative to the preſent ſeaſon, and to thoſe providential diſpenſations, which ſo naturally lead us forward in our contemplations to the great cataſtrophe of nature, when <q>all theſe things ſhall be diſſolved.</q> Nor can I doubt but that you will favour me with a ſerious attention, both the ſubject and the occaſion being ſuch, as may juſtly claim one.</p>
            <p>HOWEVER, it is not my intention to addreſs my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf merely to the paſſions of my hearers; much leſs, to take this opportunity, when the minds of many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may be ruffled and diſcompoſed, to promote the cauſe of ſuperſtition; a cauſe which, I bleſs God, I have neither any intereſt nor inclination to ſerve. I ſhall, therefore addreſs myſelf to you, as to men, and reaſonable creatures; endeavouring to gain acceſs to your hearts and conſciences, to the moſt ſecret apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of your ſouls, if I may ſo expreſs it, thro' the door of your underſtandings. And this will ſo much the rather be the manner of my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, becauſe I am perſwaded from my own obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that no religious impreſſions can be of the right kind, durable, and of laſting benefit to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:007487_0008_102b848d34b0f3e0"/>
of them, beſides thoſe which are made, or at leaſt fixed, by rational, ſober, and honeſt methods, with the concurrence and bleſſing of Him, who <q>worketh all in all.</q> It might be added, as a farther reaſon for this manner of addreſs, that the ſubject is, in its own nature, ſo univerſally intereſting and affecting, and the paſſions of people ſo generally raiſed to an high pitch already, by the late providential occurrences, that there is, perhaps, more need to bring them to calm reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by treating the ſubject in a ſober, argumentative way, than to ruffle them ſtill more, by treating it in a way altogether rhetorical and pathetic: Though I am ſenſible, that no one who has a juſt feeling of its importance, can diſcourſe coldly upon it; which would, indeed, be an inexcuſable impropriety. He that can ſpeak of the diſſolution of all things, of the heavens and the earth in flames, of eternal judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of that day of God, which iſſues in the glorious reward and triumph of the ſaints, and in the "perdition of ungodly men"; he that can ſpeak of ſuch things in a cold, icy, unaffecting ſtile, does not himſelf believe what he ſays, but only acts a part; and that, ſo unnaturally and abſurdly, as could not but diſguſt every judicious hearer. To return, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; let us,</p>
            <p>FIRST inquire, what thoſe things are, of which St. <hi>Peter</hi> is here ſpeaking; and all which, he aſſures us, ſhall be diſſolved? "Seeing then that all theſe things," &amp;c. i. e. the things which he had mentioned in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:007487_0009_102b848f0c51e670"/>
context. They are called <q>the heavens and the earth, which now are,</q> ver. 7. and ver. 10 they are more particularly diſtributed into <q>the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, the elements, the earth alſo, and the works that are therein.</q> It immediately following in the text, "Seeing then that all theſe things," &amp;c. it is evident the apoſtle muſt intend, not only all thoſe things which men themſelves cannot but look upon to be fading, tranſitory and periſhing; but alſo thoſe which appear to be the moſt ſubſtantial and durable: all the cities and towers, the temples and monuments of the world, however deep and ſtrong their founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be laid, and tho' built for perpetuity; all the magnificent works of men; all the products of human art and power, thro' ſo many ſucceſſive ages; all the mighty babels which either pride and vanity, or fear, has erected, tho' their tops ſhould reach to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; all theſe things ſhall be diſſolved. And not only all theſe works of men, but the earth itſelf, which is the work of God, and which contains and ſupports them; this habitable world itſelf, which ſeems ſo ſolid and durable. The "everlaſting hills" ſhall not laſt forever: the loftieſt mountains, with their rocks of adamant, and the very elements themſelves, of which the earth is compoſed; all theſe things expect their diſſolution. Yea, the diſſolution will extend even beyond this earth, to the air and atmoſphere which ſurround and infold it, as in a garment; if not to the planetary regions alſo, and this whole ſolar ſyſtem. For ſome are of opinion, that by the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:007487_0010_102b84909f06f288"/>
St. <hi>Peter</hi> intends, not only theſe lower regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and aerial heavens, but the aetherial alſo, with the ſun and planets. And although there are objections againſt this ſuppoſition, yet it cannot be denied that the opinion is favoured by ſome other paſſages of ſcripture, if we take them in that ſenſe, which firſt and moſt readily offers itſelf to the mind. Thus Pſalm cii.25, 26. which is quoted by the author to the Hebrews, chap. vii. <q>Of old haſt thou laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of thy hands. They ſhall periſh, but thou ſhalt endure. Yea, all of them ſhall wax old like a garment; as a veſture ſhalt thou change them, and they ſhall be changed.</q> It is far from being certain that the heavens and the earth, are here uſed metaphorically, either for men of high degree, and of low, or for the angelical hoſts and hierarchy, and for earthly rulers. They are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> perhaps, to be underſtood literally, for that material earth, and thoſe heavenly bodies, which "in the beginning God created;" <note n="†" place="bottom">Gen. i.1.</note> which "declare his glory, and ſhew his handy-work."<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſalm xix.1.</note> A paſſage in the 12th of Hebrews may be thus li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally underſtood alſo, where the author alludes to the ſhaking and quaking of mount Sinai, at the giving of the law, and to a prophecy of <hi>Haggai</hi> concerning what ſhould come to paſs under the reign of the Meſſiah, or rather at the cloſe thereof, when the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod comes for his <q>delivering up the kingdom to God, even the Father.</q> "If they eſcaped not,"
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:007487_0011_102b8492237be0a8"/>
ſays he, <q>who refuſed him that ſpake on earth, much more ſhall not we eſcape, if we turn away from him that ſpeaketh from heaven; whoſe voice then ſhook the earth: but now he hath promiſed ſaying, yet once more, I ſhake not the earth only, but alſo heaven. And this, 'yet once more', ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the removing of thoſe things that are ſhaken, as of things that are made, that thoſe things which cannot be ſhaken may remain.</q> I am ſenſible that a figurative interpretation is uſually put upon this paſſage: but it may admit of ſome doubt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it ought to be thus underſtood. For ſince the ſhaking of the earth, in the former part of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, where the apoſtle refers to the giving of the law, plainly means a literal ſhaking of it, is it not moſt natural to underſtand literally what follows in the latter part of it, concerning the ſhaking of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, "as of things that are made?" And it is to be obſerved, that ſome mighty concuſſion, and certain great changes, of the heavenly bodies, as well as of this earth, ſeem plainly foretold in the revelation of St. <hi>John,</hi> when that important period ſhall arrive, to which St. <hi>Peter</hi> alludes in the text. <q>And I beheld when he had opened the ſixth ſeal, and lo, there was a great earthquake, and the ſun became black as ſackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood; and the ſtars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig-tree caſteth her untimely figs, when ſhe is ſhaken of a mighty wind; and the heaven departed as a ſcrowl when it is rolled together;
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:007487_0012_102b84944017c208"/>
and every mountain and iſland were moved out of their places.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. vi.12, 13, 14.</note> It ſeems not unlikely that the ſame period, and the ſame great events, are referred to, in the prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah:</hi> 
               <q>My ſalvation is gone forth, and mine arms ſhall judge the people—Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath; for the heavens ſhall vaniſh away like ſmoke, and the earth ſhall wax old like a garment; and they that dwell therein ſhall die in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: but my ſalvation ſhall be forever, and my righteouſneſs ſhall not be aboliſhed.</q> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Iſa. li. 5, 6.</note> I leave every one to judge for himſelf, after carefully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aming and comparing theſe, and ſuch like paſſages, whether it is this earth only which is to be diſſolved?</p>
            <p>BUT I muſt not enlarge upon this head any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The things which St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of in the text, are certainly all thoſe things which are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, in the preceeding verſes, under theſe terms, the "heavens," the "elements," the "earth," and the "works that are therein." And by comparing other paſſages of ſcripture, which predict the mighty changes and revolutions which ſhall hereafter take place in the natural, viſible world, it appears moſt probable to me, that the apoſtle intends this whole ſyſtem, incluſive of the ſun and planetary regions, as well as this habitable world, with all its furniture. Thus far, it is not unlikely, this great diſſolution will extend. Wherefore</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:007487_0013_102b849684bb2e80"/>SECONDLY, let us inquire more particularly what is to be underſtood by the diſſolution of theſe things.</p>
            <p>NO one, certainly, can hereby underſtand their annihilation; or ſuppoſe that they are all, at length, to vaniſh into nothing, and, by being blotted out of, leave a mighty void and blank in, the creation of God. The language of ſcripture, indeed, evidently implies the contrary: For no man by the "diſſolving," by the "ſhaking," the "removing," the <q>folding up</q> and "changing" of things, or even by their "periſhing," underſtands their ceaſing to be, or a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation of exiſtence. But neither, upon the other hand, can all theſe expreſſions which the ſcriptures make uſe of with reference to this matter, mean only ſome little, inconſiderable alterations in the external form, qualities, and appearances of the things intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. They undoubtedly mean, in general, ſome mighty and aſtoniſhing revolutions and changes in the material, viſible world; ſome great cataſtrophe which is to befal it, in ſome future period, ſo that it may be ſaid to be deſtroyed, and to become a wide extended ruin: They imply, that the whole preſent frame and courſe of nature ſhall be altered; all things putting on a very different aſpect from that which they now wear, ſo as to have the appearance rather of a world laid in ruins, than of a regular, beautiful fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick, as it is in general at preſent; though it has evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently been impaired and damaged in ſome degree
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:007487_0014_102b8498629689b8"/>
already, and is daily going to decay and deſtruction. Nothing leſs than this can be implied in the diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of all theſe things; in their waxing old and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing; in their being folded up and changed; in the powers of heaven and earth being ſhaken, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>AS to this earth, our preſent ſcene of action, and in the fate and fortune of which, we ſeem to be more eſpecially intereſted; the ſcriptures plainly inform us, that it ſhall be thus ruined, thus deſtroyed: And they teach us ſtill more particularly, by what means this deſtruction and diſſolution ſhall be affected, or brought about; namely, by fire. And whatever St. <hi>Peter</hi> may intend in the context, by the heavens, he extends the future conflagration to them, not limiting it to this habitable earth. It may ſeem ſtrange that the ſame world ſhould be ſubjected to two ſuch dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent cataſtrophes, as firſt to be drowned, and then burned. But the apoſtle having mentioned the former, in the preceeding context, foretels the latter, in the following language. <q>But the heavens and the earth which now are,—are kept in ſtore, reſerved unto fire</q>—<q>The heavens ſhall paſs away with a great noiſe, and the elements ſhall melt with fervent heat, the earth alſo and the works that are therein ſhall be burnt up.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Pet. iii.7, &amp; 10.</note> And when the apoſtle imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſubjoins, <q>Seeing then that all theſe things ſhall be diſſolved,</q> &amp;c. it is manifeſt that he means, thus deſtroyed, thus diſſolved and ruined, by fire; by a general flame, that ſhall embrace and wrap
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:007487_0015_102b8ef8442ff1f8"/>
them up, and prey upon them till they are reduced, as it were, to one mighty burning maſs, or fiery chaos. The expreſſions, that the elements ſhall "melt with fervent heat," that the earth with its works ſhall be "burnt up," and that all theſe things ſhall be "diſſolved," are very ſtrong and empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical; and can imply nothing ſhort of the utter ruin and deſtruction of the world with its contents, by that furious element which ſhall be let looſe upon it. Even the great mountains, the burdens of the earth, the fabled props of the ſkies, and habitations of gods, ſhall flow down; <q>the hills ſhall melt, and the earth be burnt up at the preſence of the Lord, yea, the world, and all that dwell therein.</q> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Nah. 1.5.</note>
This is the predicted fate and deſtruction, at leaſt of that globe which we inhabit; and where vain, fooliſh, and worldly minded men imagine, that even <q>their houſes ſhall continue forever, and their dwelling places to all generations; where "they call their lands after their own names,</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſalm xlix.11.</note> and ſet up pillars and monuments to eternize their memory! All theſe things ſhall be diſſolved; reduced to cinders, aſhes and ſmoke; and paſs away—
<q>
                  <l>The cloud-capt towers, the gorgeous palaces,</l>
                  <l>The ſolemn temples, the great globe itſelf,</l>
                  <l>Yea, all which it inherit, ſhall diſſolve,</l>
                  <l>And, like the baſely fabrick of a viſion,</l>
                  <l>Leave not a wreck behind! <note n="†" place="bottom">Shakeſ.</note>
                  </l>

               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:007487_0016_102b8efa1ff85380"/>
Even the preſent ruins of the earth; the horrid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of cities burnt, or laid in heaps; of temples and monuments, of triumphal arches and pyramids, half mouldered away, or overturned; the rubbiſh and ruins of ages, made and left by inundations, ſtorms and tempeſts, volcanos and earthquakes; theſe ruins ſhall be themſelves ruined, together with whatever is moſt beautiful and magnificent in the world, and the world itſelf: All, all theſe things ſhall be diſſolved; and neither the form nor place of any of them be any more diſtinguiſhed, or remembred, when this laſt fire has done its appointed work!</p>
            <p>WHAT changes, yea, what deſtruction analogous to this, when the earth and the works that are therein ſhall be burnt up, may happen to other parts of this viſible creation, about the ſame time, I ſhall not now pretend to inquire, much leſs to determine. But I dare almoſt be confident, that the holy ſcriptures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate ſomewhat of this ſort to us; and that theſe numerous paſſages cannot be tolerably explained to a ſenſe merely metaphorical or figurative. And indeed the moſt literal and obvious ſenſe of ſcripture, ſhould ever be adhered to, till we ſee ſome plain and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive reaſon for departing from it; as, I muſt confeſs, I am not able to do in the preſent caſe. Do we know that this is the only ſinful world, which may hereafter be ripe for deſtruction, and doomed thereto? Or is it any more abſurd and incongruous to ſuppoſe, that this whole planetary or ſolar ſyſtem, ſhould at
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:007487_0017_102b8efba9ec3938"/>
length "wax old," and "periſh," be "diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved," and "paſs away with a great noiſe;" and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a wide-extended ruin in the creation of God, for a time, 'till the time of the renovation or <q>reſtitution of all things;</q>

               </note> is there any thing more abſurd or incredible in this ſuppoſition, I ſay, than in ſuppoſing that this earth ſhall undergo ſuch a diſſolution? Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps there may be; but I cannot tell in what reſpect: And I think the ſcriptures have foretold the one, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as plainly as they have the other. It might be added, that the phaenomena of comets, or blazing-ſtars, give a degree of credibility to this opinion, not to ſay of probability, notwithſtanding ſome conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral accounts and ſolutions given of them, which do not favour it. However, this is neither a time nor a place to philoſophize upon the point, were one ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of it.</p>

               <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Pet. iii.13.</note> Laying theſe things together, with ſome others which I have not time to mention, we have at leaſt, ſome reaſon to think that the deſtruction and fiery diſſolution, of which St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks in the text and context, will not be confined to this globe; though I do not pretend to determine how far it will reach beyond it; or how many worlds may become fuel for this laſt burning, and <q>paſs away with a great noiſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THIS earth, in which we are more immediately and particularly concerned, is apparently haſtening to that deſtruction, to which it is condemned, and was fore-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, by its Creator; I mean to a diſſolution by fire. Inſomuch that ſome of the old philoſophers, not only ſaw and predicted that it would come to this end; but even expreſſed their ſurprize, that it was not thus deſtroyed before their own time. By the frequent hints, and alluſions, and even plain predictions, which are found in ancient, prophane writers, reſpecting this matter, it is not improbable that there had been ſome common tradition concerning it, derived from <hi>Noah</hi> perhaps, and univerſally propagated amongſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:007487_0019_102b8f00617dfd68"/>
of the earth, at its firſt peopling after the deluge. For ſome of them ſpeak of a future confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration as certain, without aſſigning any other reaſon for it, than that it was <hi>decreed by the fates,</hi> or that others had aſſerted it before them; i. e. it was a tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion handed down from one generation to another, from time immemorial. However, ſome philoſophers were doubtleſs confirmed in the belief of this traditionary doctrine, by obſerving the preparations which were made in nature by the God thereof, for bringing ſuch a ſtupendous event to paſs; the immenſe quantities of coal, ſulphur, and other combuſtible matter in the bowels, and upon the ſurface of the earth; burning mountains, and ſubterraneous fires; the ſudden eruption of fire and flames in ſome places where they were leaſt ſuſpected; particularly when the ground has been cracked and opened by earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes: For of this, hiſtory makes mention. Theſe, with various other things, made it appear propable to the obſerving, that the element of fire would at length become predominant over all. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>IT is not, perhaps, unworthy of remarking, that amongſt the numerous paſſages in the ancients, where mention is made of the future burning of the world, the following well-known one, does not exempt even the SEA itſelf from the common fate, how extravagant and incredible ſoever this may ſeem.</p>

                  <p>BY the ſurprizing tranſmutations which we daily ſee in nature, it ſeems as if there was nothing but what might poſſibly be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into that which is moſt unlike itſelf; ſo that even the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of water may perhaps acquire new qualities, which, inſtead of extinguiſhing fire, ſhall render it proper fuel for it. And it is obſervable, that St. <hi>John</hi> deſcribes the "new earth" as being without any ſea at all, Rev. xxi.1. <q>And I ſaw a new heaven, and a new earth; for the firſt heaven and the firſt earth were paſſed away; and THERE WAS NO MORE SEA.</q> Vid. <hi>Nah.</hi> 1.4.</p>

<pb n="22" facs="unknown:007487_0020_102b8f02422b5410"/>
aught we know, over huge burning lakes and caverns, extending from country to country; ſome of which may not be very far from the ſurface of the ground, the fire ſtill ſtruggling to get from its priſon, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally aſcending. By which ſubterraneous fires, ſome have, not improbably, accounted for the phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena of hot and boiling ſprings; which are ſo common in many countries. Nor does the dry land only, ſeem to be thus undermined; but the ſea itſelf, if we may credit the accounts which ſome have given. <note n="†" place="bottom">IT is ſaid that, upon the concuſſion of earthquakes, flames and ſmoke have been ſeen to find their way thro' the watry abyſs, burſting out with great fury, and aſcending far above its ſurface. It is likewiſe ſaid, that conſiderable iſlands have been hove up in different parts of the ſea, with cinders, and other evident marks of fire upon them; and that ſome iſlands have been intirely ſunk by earthquakes, is not, I ſuppoſe, doubted by any. If the late ſurprizing accounts which ſome of our ſea-faring men have given, be in fact true, concerning the effects of the late earthquake many leagues from land, it will be a confirmation of what has been ſaid above. For to what can that deſtruction of the fiſh, both great and ſmall, which they ſpeak of, be ſo probably attributed, as to ſome noxious ſteams and vapours, iſſuing at the rents and chaſms made in the bottom of the ſea, by ſubaqueous ſires? However, I would not be too haſty in believing theſe accounts; much leſs, poſitive, ſuppoſing them true, that this is the true ſolution of ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, and I believe I may add, unheard of, a phaenomenon.</note>

the maſtery of all the reſt, every where, it ſeems to be gradually gaining the conqueſt of them. And if we regard that ſure word of prophecy, whereunto we ought to take heed, we muſt believe that it will at length, at the appointed time, become victorious and triumphant: When this earth, and the works that are therein ſhall be burnt up, and <q>all theſe things ſhall be diſſolved.</q> But</p>
            <p>THIRDLY, Let us in the next place inquire, when all theſe things ſhall be thus diſſolved? When this great event ſhall come to paſs? or what will be the fore-runners, concomitants and conſequents of it?</p>
            <p>No one, I conclude, will imagine, that by, <q>When this event ſhall come to paſs,</q> I mean ſtrictly and properly, how long it will be before it is accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? how many days, months, years, or even ages? Which would be an inquiry, equally fruitleſs and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous. Neither the world's nativity, nor its diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and death, can be calculated by any rules of aſtrology or philoſophy; by human arithmetic and art: Nor has God, whoſe word gave birth and being to it, and who only knows its end, particularly and determinately revealed to us the time when it ſhall fall to ruins, and be diſſolved. This important period is only marked out to us in ſcripture, by another, of which we are equally uncertain: Which is rather informing us what ſhall be coincident with this event in point of time, than telling us how ſoon it ſhall come to paſs, or how long be deferred. The holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:007487_0022_102b8f05f95e9988"/>
have informed us in general, that it ſhall be accompliſhed at Chriſt's ſecond coming; his coming in glory and majeſty to judge that world, which he once came in "the form of a ſervant" to redeem. Thus in the preceeding context, St. <hi>Peter</hi> having ſaid, that the <q>heavens and the earth which now are, are kept in ſtore, reſerved unto fire,</q> immediately ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins, <q>againſt the day of judgment, and perdition of ungodly men.</q> Plainly intimating, as it appears to me, not only that the future conflagration and the laſt judgment ſhall be contemporary, or coincident in reſpect of time; but alſo, that the world is thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved unto fire, partly, at leaſt, for the place and ſcene of that puniſhment and perdition, which awaits the wicked, then to be judged and condemned. Agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably whereto, their ſentence, as we have it in our Lord's own words, will be, <q>Depart from me, ye curſed, into everlaſting fire.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Matth. xxv.41.</note> What fire can ſo probably be intended here, as that by which this earth is finally to be diſſolved? this earth which, it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſaid, is reſerved unto fire, againſt that day, and the perdition of the ungodly? But not to digreſs. That the diſſolution of all things, and the ſecond coming of our Lord, will be coincident, is ſtill farther evident from this chapter; beyond which, indeed, I need not go for the proof of this point. St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s diſcourſe here, concerning the conflagration, ſeems plainly relative to, and occaſioned by, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetic view and fore-ſight which he had of thoſe

All days, times, and ſeaſons, are indeed God's, in one ſenſe; but that of our Lord's coming to judge the quick and the dead, is eminently and emphatically ſo. It may be called the day of God with peculiar propriety, as it is God who has choſen, fixed and prae-determined it, for ſo grand and important a purpoſe. For, in the language of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 
               <q>God commandeth all men every where to repent; becauſe He hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a day, in the which He will judge the world in righteouſneſs, by that man whom He hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained; whereof He hath given</q> [ſufficient and ample ground of] <q>aſſurance unto all men, in that He hath raiſed him from the dead.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts xvii.31, 32.</note> This is alſo emphatically the day of God, as He only knows when it will arrive: For our Lord has ſaid that there are ſome "times" and "ſeaſons," which it is not for us to know, and <q>which the Father hath put in his own power.</q> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Acts i.7.</note> And concerning this important pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod in particular, our Saviour has declared ſaying, <q>Of that day and of that hour knoweth no man, no

not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Mark xiii.32.</note> This is, moreover, emphatical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the day of God, as His power, wiſdom, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and glory; His goodneſs and faithfulneſs to the ſaints, and His juſt ſeverity againſt the workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, will therein be made manifeſt, and appear far more illuſtrious than they did before: as it is the time wherein the <q>myſtery of God ſhall be finiſhed, as He hath declared to his ſervants the prophets;</q> all his works then appearing to be truth, and his ways judgment, tho' clouds and darkneſs are now round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him; the day which ſhall reveal him to be God indeed; the all-powerful and juſt Sovereign of the world; and which is, therefore, called the <q>day of the revelation of his righteous judgment.</q>

            </p>
            <p>THIS is, I think, a plain, ſcriptural account, why that day of our Saviour's ſecond appearing, which is ſometimes ſtyled the day of the Lord, and the day of Chriſt, is here called the day of God: Nor is there any need of having recourſe to metaphyſics, and ſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtic divinity, for a ſolution.

            <p>IT ſeems, from the ſcripture account, that this great day of God, wherein all men are to <q>receive the things done in the body;</q> and in which the earth, with the works that are therein, ſhall be burnt up, ſhall be uſhered in with ſome aſtoniſhing phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, or appearances, in the natural world; which ſhall be a kind of monitory tokens and ſignals of its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, whether regarded as ſuch or not, by a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, profane and faithleſs world; ſuch monitory ſigns and tokens as thoſe which, it is ſaid, preceeded the deſtruction of Jeruſalem; or rather, far more ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing.

            <p>I KNOW ſome interpret what is ſaid in this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter concerning the coming of our Lord, of a figurative, and leſs proper coming, viz. as he came to deſtroy Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, with the whole jewiſh polity. Though ſome things in our Saviour's diſcourſe, ſeem to favour this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; yet, I muſt confeſs, I cannot but look upon this as a very lean, jejune expoſition of it. It has, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, a farther view; looking forward to that far more auguſt, glorious, and univerſally intereſting coming of our Lord, when he ſhall literally deſcend from heaven, and <q>all nations ſhall be gathered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him,</q> to receive his righteous ſentence.</p>
            <p>AND, indeed, there are ſome things in this diſcourſe, which cannot poſſibly be referred to that figurative coming of Chriſt before mentioned; but only to the time of his coming to judge the quick and the dead: Particularly the verſe immediately following the
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:007487_0029_102b8f12053a8fe0"/>
paſſage laſt quoted— <q>And then ſhall he ſend his angels, and ſhall gather his elect from the four winds, from the uttermoſt part of the earth to the uttermoſt part of heaven.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Ver. 27.</note> When were, or when will be all the elect, the faithful and choſen of God, thus gathered together by the miniſtration of angels, but when our Lord ſhall <q>appear the ſecond time, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin, unto ſalvation?</q> This, ſurely, was not done when Jeruſalem was deſtroyed: But this, we know, will be done at the judgment of the great day: Our Lord has particularly taught us ſo, in his applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that well-known parable, concerning the tares and the wheat; wherein the houſholder is introduced ſaying, <q>Let both grow together until the harveſt; and in the time of harveſt I will ſay to the reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, gather ye together firſt the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.</q> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Matth. 13.30.</note> Part of our Saviour's explanation of this parable, is as follows: "The harveſt," ſays he, <q>is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels. As therefore the tares are gathered and burnt in the fire, ſo ſhall it be in the end of the world. The Son of man ſhall ſend forth his angels, and they ſhall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them that do iniquity; and ſhall caſt them into a furnace of fire; there ſhall be wailing and gnaſhing of teeth.

                  </bibl>
                  <p>SEEING then that all theſe things ſhall be diſſolved, what manner of perſons ought ye to be in all holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation and godlineſs,</p>
                  <p>LOOKING for, and haſting unto, the coming of the day of GOD?—</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>WE conſidered, in the morning, What things thoſe are, of which St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks in the text; all which are to be diſſolved: Viz, whatever is comprehended in the context under theſe terms, the "heavens", the "elements", the "earth", and the "works that are therein".</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:007487_0034_102b8f1b056dbd70"/>WE alſo conſidered what is meant by the diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe things; Viz, their deſtruction by fire.</p>
            <p>And,</p>
            <p>LASTLY, we conſidered when this great and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting event ſhall come to paſs; Viz. at our Saviour's ſecond appearing, to judge the world in righteouſneſs; at that period, which is called in the text and context, the "day of judgment," the "day of the Lord," and the "day of GOD."</p>
            <p>I NOW proceed, as was propoſed, and in conformity to the original ſcope of the paſſage, to improve this reflection, that all theſe things ſhall be thus diſſolved, at the mentioned period, as a motive to excite you to univerſal holineſs, and thereby to prepare for the time when this event ſhall come to paſs. For ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſhall aſſuredly arrive; ſeeing that all theſe things ſhall certainly <q>be diſſolved, what manner of perſons ought ye to be in all holy converſation and godlineſs, looking for, and haſting unto, the coming of this day of God!</q> Having urged this argument in a general way, I ſhall then improve it with a more particular reference to the late alarming occurrences in divine providence, which ſeem ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally to lead our thoughts to the great and general cataſtrophey of the world, when all theſe things ſhall not be only ſhaken, but diſſolved; and when we muſt "all appear before the judgment-ſeat of Chriſt."</p>
            <p>BUT though I ſhall urge the conſideration of theſe things, as a fit, and, indeed, the fitteſt motive, to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:007487_0035_102b8f1ce0d15630"/>
piety, and holineſs in all our converſation; yet I ſhall neither "ſpeak wickedly for God," nor deſigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impoſe upon &amp; terrify men, by repreſenting the time when they ſhall come to paſs, as being either certainly, or even probably, very near at hand. For though ſome might poſſibly think it a pious, I could not, for my own part, but think it an impious pretence, that ſuch an artifice would be commendable, ſince it might be a means of promoting that which is good; and of putting people, without any delay, upon <q>working out their ſalvation with fear and trembling.</q> No good can be eventually done, by <q>handling the word of God deceitfully,</q> or by thoſe "hidden things of diſhoneſty," which all ought to "renounce." The words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> may well be conſidered as a caution againſt ſuch kind of fetches, and cunning artifices: <q>If the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie, UNTO HIS GLORY, why alſo am I yet judged as a ſinner? And not rather, (as we be ſlanderouſly reported, and as ſome affirm that we ſay) Let us do evil that good may come? whoſe damnation is is juſt.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. iii.7, 8.</note> And as to the particular point now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſideration; though this ſame apoſtle was, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, as much ſet to promote the glory of God, and the ſalvation of men, as any other preacher of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs ever was, excepting the <q>Apoſtle and High Prieſt of our profeſſion, Chriſt Jeſus, who was [ſo eminently] faithful to Him that appointed him;</q> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Heb. iii.1, 2.</note> and though he ſo often <q>reaſoned of righteouſneſs,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:007487_0036_102b8f1f68071db8"/>
temperance and judgment to come,</q> cauſing ſome of the moſt abandoned ſinners to "tremble;" yet St. <hi>Paul,</hi> I ſay, never endeavoured to make ſinners trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, by ſuch means; by repreſenting the day of God, as nearer at hand than it really was. So far was he from doing thus, that when the church at Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica, as it ſeems, had miſtaken his meaning in his firſt epiſtle, thinking he had intimated that the time of Chriſt's coming was very near, he, in his ſecond epi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtle to that church, took particular care to correct their miſtake, beſeeching them even by the coming of Chriſt, not to think that he would come ſo ſoon as they imagined. "Now we beſeech you, brethren," ſays he, <q>by the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and by our gathering together unto him, that ye be not ſoon ſhaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by ſpirit, nor by word, nor by letter, as from us, as that the day of Chriſt is at hand. Let no Man deceive you by any means.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Theſſ. ii.1, 2, 3.</note> You ſee how ſollicitous the apoſtle was, leſt people ſhould be miſled and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, though with reſpect to a point, wherein a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception might, in the opinion of ſome, be rather ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous than prejudicial to them.</p>
            <p>IN humble imitation of this bleſſed apoſtle, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Him, in whoſe mouth there was never any guile, I now ſay, Let none be <q>ſoon ſhaken, or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, by word, as from me,—as that the day of Chriſt is [even now] at hand;</q> though it is ſo long ſince the apoſtle wrote. I will not, indeed preſume
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:007487_0037_102b8f2180e2d650"/>
to ſay poſitively, that that day is not at hand; but would rather ſay to you, <q>Watch,—(for ye know not when the maſter of the houſe cometh; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at even, or at midnight, or at the cock-crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or in the morning) leſt coming ſuddenly, he find you ſleeping: And what I ſay unto you, I ſay unto all, Watch.</q> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Mark xiii.35.</note> It is not the nearneſs of this day, reſpecting which point I do not preſume to determine any thing, but the certainty of it, and its importance to you, that I would urge as a motive to holineſs in all your converſation. And, indeed, were I to give my real opinion, it would be, that this great day of the Lord, and conſequently the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of all theſe things, is ſtill very remote in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity. For I humbly conceive, from the ſeries of prophecies, particularly in the Revelation of St. <hi>John,</hi> reſpecting the things that were to come to paſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the conſummation of all things, that many of the events therein predicted, are not yet accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and that many ages are neceſſary for the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them.</p>
            <p>HOWEVER, I may be miſtaken; and, as was intimated before, would be cautious in what I ſay upon this point. For I had much rather, from the certainty that this day will come, ſooner or later, exhort you to be circumſpect, and diligent in preparing for it, than, by confidently aſſerting that it is at a great diſtance, even ſeem to give any countenance to a contrary behaviour. I ſay, "even ſeem" to do ſo: becauſe our obligation
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:007487_0038_102b8f238107dae0"/>
to be holy in all our converſation, would not really and properly ſpeaking, be leſſened, even tho' we were aſſured that the day of God was very remote; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it will certainly come at laſt. For, as was inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated above, it is not ſo much from the ſuppoſed near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or diſtance of this period, that our obligation, in point of reaſon, ariſes, to make preparation for it, as from the nature of the thing itſelf, the certainty of it, and the concern we have in it: And conſequently, its ſuppoſed, or even known remoteneſs, could not much, if at all, diminiſh our obligation to be univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally holy, this day being certainly future, and hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly approaching. And that which is certainly future, and ſtill drawing nearer, will as certainly be at length preſent, however remote now. Truly wiſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident men will live as "ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in the world," tho' they may believe the day of the Lord is far diſtant, as if they knew it was at hand. For ought not men, in poin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of reaſon, duty and intereſt, to abſtain from thoſe ſins, which will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly damn them a thouſand or a million years hence, as if they would damn them within an hundred, fifty, or ten? On the other hand, will not a man who acts upon the principles of reaſon, be as ſollicitous to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come entitled to eternal life and glory in the kingdom of heaven, altho' he believes it will be long before he can come to the full poſſeſſion and enjoyment thereof, provided it is certainly attainable, as if he might arrive at this poſſeſſion and enjoyment in a much ſhorter time? When the torments of hell are hazarded, and
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:007487_0039_102b8f250d94af40"/>
the eternal joys of heaven are the prize, and the reality of both is firmly believed, their nearneſs or remote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in point of time, is ſcarce of any weight or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration at all, in the mind of a reaſonable, thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful man: Eternity ſwallows up all; and, in the eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of ſuch a perſon, equals all limited, temporary durations and diſtances. So that I had almoſt applied to a truly wiſe man, whoſe care and providence for himſelf rap him into ſcenes and ages to come, even into all futurity, what is ſaid in the context concerning the all-wiſe God, whoſe care and providence extend to all things, and to whom are known <q>all his works from the beginning;</q> — That with him, <q>one day is as a thouſand years, and a thouſand years as one day.</q>

            <p>BUT of how little conſequence it is to us, in a prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical ſenſe, whether the day of God, and of the diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of all things, is near at hand, or far diſtant, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears ſtill more plainly and obviouſly from a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the ſhortneſs and uncertainty of human life, and of our probationary ſtate. For if we are to put off theſe frail, decaying tabernacles in a few years at fartheſt, and, poſſiibly, in a few days, hours, or even moments; if this is our only time of trial; if death will both find and leave us, either prepared or unprepared to appear before the great tribunal; and if as death finds and leaves us, ſo we ſhall be found of our judge at laſt, holy ſtill, or ſtill unholy and filthy; if theſe things are ſo, ſurely we ought to be as diligent
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:007487_0040_102b8f2743586e18"/>
in our preparations for the coming of the Day of God, as if it were nigh, even at the door. Beſides; if, immediately at death, we are received into regions of bliſs, or go to realms of woe; there to remain in a ſeparate, unembodied ſtate, either in a joyful expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or in anxious fears and apprehenſions of the great day, and of our final ſentence; if this is the caſe, of what great, or rather, of how little moment is it to us, whether that period is now very near, or very remote? Do you imagine that <hi>Lazarus,</hi> when he died, and was "carried by angels into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s boſom", <note n="†" place="bottom">Luke xvi.19—26.</note> then tho't himſelf the leſs wiſe; or that the rich man, when he died, and <q>in hell [<hi>hades</hi>] lift up his eyes, being in torments</q>, <note n="†" place="bottom">Luke xvi.19—26.</note> accounted himſelf the leſs fooliſh and improvident, becauſe the day of judgment was then at a great diſtance! Of how little conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration was the nearneſs or remoteneſs of the day of God, to either of them, when they had both finiſhed their mortal courſe? when the one had made ſure his title to eternal life, ſo that he was paſt danger of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of it; and the other had neglected to do ſo, in the ſeaſon for it, and till it was too late? when the one was actually in a ſtate of reſt and joy, with <q>hopes full of immortality</q>, the earneſt of that <q>far more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, and eternal weight of glory</q>, which awaits the righteous in the day of Chriſt's appearing; and the other was in a ſtate of torment, in a <q>certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</q>, the earneſt of that <q>far more exceeding
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:007487_0041_102b8f29766293b0"/>
and eternal weight</q> of infamy and woe, which awaits the wicked in the ſame terrible day? when there was an impaſſable "gulf fixed between them' <note n="†" place="bottom">Ver. 26.</note>, ſo that neither of them could remove to the other, to be a ſharer in his bliſs, or a partaker of his plagues?</p>
            <p>LET us, therefore, remember that however re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote that day of God may be, wherein <q>all theſe things ſhall be diſſolved</q>; yet the earthly houſe of this our tabernacle, this mortal body, will ſoon be diſſolved; perhaps much ſooner than we may now imagine: <q>For what is your Life? It is even a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour that appeareth for a little time, and then va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth away</q>. <note n="*" place="bottom">James iv.14.</note> Should you attain to the greateſt meaſure of man's days in this age of the world, alas! even ſuch a life is "ſpent as a tale that is told". But ſickneſs, and a thouſand caſualties, as we term them, may ſpeedily put an unexpected period to your days. We may be blaſted by a ſtroke from heaven above; or the earth from beneath may open her mouth, and ſwallow us up, at a time when we are moſt ſecure, and leaſt apprehenſive of danger. For we daily tread upon, and nightly ſlumber over, treacherous, deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ground, to which we can ſcarce truſt our bodies and eſtates; and which is, ſurely, far leſs to be relied on, when the ſalvation of our ſouls is at ſtake, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity hangs upon a moment! And as we are every moment liable to death, by one means or other, let us remember that this is much the ſame thing, as if we were every moment liable to be called before the
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:007487_0042_102b8f2b04acda88"/>
judgment-ſeat of Chriſt; and that, with reſpect to us, all theſe things are then diſſolved, and paſs away, when we ourſelves are diſſolved, and paſs away from them.</p>
            <p>LEAVING, therefore, the nearneſs or remoteneſs, call it which you pleaſe, of this day of God, wholly out of the queſtion for the preſent, as what is really of little moment to us, and what ſcarce at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns practical religion, in the eye of reaſon; let us now conſider the thing itſelf, the diſſolution of all things, and the day of our Lord's appearing, only as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; that ſo we may ſee <q>what manner of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons we ought to be in all holy converſation and godlineſs, looking for, and haſting unto, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of</q> this important period. Repreſent to yourſelves, then, in thought and imagination, and with a firm, fixed faith in the truth of the ſcriptures; I ſay, repreſent to yourſelves this day of God, when the elements ſhall melt with fervent heat; when the earth and the works that are therein ſhall be burnt up; when all theſe terreſtrial things, and the heavens themſelves being on fire, ſhall be diſſolved; when the Lord himſelf ſhall be revealed from the higheſt heaven, where he now ſits enthron'd; revealed in flaming fire, taking vengeance on the ungodly, who obey not his goſpel; and <q>admired in all them that believe;</q> when you, and I, and all nations, ſhall ſtand before him; and, in conſequence of his righteous ſentence, ſome <q>ſhall go away into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting

               <note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. xxv.46.</note> If you believe the words of Him who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lie, you believe that theſe ſayings are true and faithful. And, what is the proper practical inference from them, every man's own heart tells him. For if you give credit to theſe things, I need not, ſurely, inform you, but only refer it to your own reaſon and conſcience, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> does in the text, <q>What manner of perſons ye ought to be, in all holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation and godlineſs;</q> how circumſpect in all your behaviour; how careful to avoid every known ſin; how diligent in the practice of every known du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; how pious towards God, and charitable towards man; how ſober and temperate in all things; how ſollicitous leſt in any thing you diſpleaſe Him, who is now your righteous Law-giver, and will hereafter be your Judge; how greatly concerned in all things, and at all times, to approve yourſelves to Him; how you ought to live and converſe from day to day, under a lively, animated ſenſe of theſe things, doing every thing, <q>whatſoever you do in word or deed, in the name of the Lord Jeſus;</q> how dead to all theſe things which are to be diſſolved; and how alive unto Him, who is the <q>ſame yeſterday, to day and for ever:</q> redeeming the time in preparing for ſo intereſting an hour; or, as it is expreſſed in the latter part of the text, <q>looking for, and haſting unto, the coming of the day of God.</q> By "looking for" this day is doubtleſs meant, habitually expecting it,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:007487_0044_102b8f2f4eebd300"/>
waiting for it, aſſuring ourſelves that it <q>will come, and will not tarry.</q> The other phraſe, <q>haſting unto</q> it, is pretty ſingular; and it may be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to aſcertain, preciſely and critically, the meaning of it: Nor ſhall I, at preſent, ſpend time in doing it. It will bear ſeveral ſenſes, ſomewhat different from, though allied to, each others. But in general, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, it means advancing towards this day, by running our chriſtian race ſwiftly, with the utmoſt diligence; and making progreſs in holineſs. For as he who ſlumbers and ſleeps, living as <q>without God in the world,</q> and as if there were no ſuch day approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, may be ſaid to "put it far away" from him, and to turn away from it, endeavouring to avoid and ſhun it; ſo, on the other hand, he who always lives and acts with a view to it, keeping it uppermoſt in his thoughts, diligently preparing for it, and having his loins at all times girded about, like a good and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervant, who, ſtanding at the door, waits his Lord's return; he that does thus, I ſay, may be ſaid to haſte unto the coming of this day: He, as it were, runs to meet it in its approach; and, in tho't, in faith, and holy hope, anticipates its arrival, making it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to himſelf, however diſtant. This it is in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, to <q>look for, and haſten unto, the coming of the day of God.</q> But to return.</p>
            <p>YOU cannot but ſee, and even feel, the force of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s argument in the text; the reaſonableneſs and wiſdom of being holy in all our converſation;
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:007487_0045_102b8f30d6a91238"/>
and the great, the unſpeakable folly and danger, of being otherwiſe, ſeeing that all theſe things are to be diſſolved, and ſuch a day of retribution is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching. To imagine, that any one did not both ſee and feel the force of this reaſoning, would be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually a reflection upon his head and heart. You know that it is a thing of infinite concernment to you, and to all men in general, to be prepared for this deciſive moment, by holineſs in heart and life: Becauſe all men have immortal ſouls, either to be ſaved or loſt; and becauſe all will, in this day, be called to render an account of themſelves, to the great Judge of quick and dead; when <q>God will bring every work into judgment, with every ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret thing;</q> and when we ſhall all receive, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively, <q>the things done in the body, according to that we have done, whether it be good or bad.</q>
            </p>
            <p>WITH how great weight and force ſhould this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument come upon the hearts and conſciences of wicked men? the hearts and conſciences of thoſe, who have never had the fear of God before their eyes? who have been, throughout their lives, and thoſe perhaps long ones, provoking the <q>Holy One of Iſrael,</q> by their unrighteouſneſs and oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, their lewdneſs, debaucheries and blaſphemies? the hearts and conſciences of thoſe who have been continually ſinning, not only againſt the light and the God of nature, but alſo againſt the light and grace of the goſpel; againſt the <q>God and Father
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:007487_0046_102b8f32a40dc838"/>
of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</q> and the <q>Father of mercies?</q> of thoſe who, inſtead of ſeeking the things that are above, and laying up for themſelves a good foundation againſt the time to come, a treaſure in the heavens, where neither moth nor ruſt doth cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, have been ſetting their affections only on things on the earth? the things of this preſent world, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready doomed to deſtruction, the faſhion of which paſſeth away; and which, together with all the works and treaſures, and the things of it, ſhall at length be burnt up and diſſolved? How unwiſe? how improvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent? how guilty are ſuch men? And how much does it concern them to "break off their ſins by righteouſneſs?" to be reconciled to God by repentance towards Him, and "faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt"? and to walk before God in holineſs and righteouſneſs the remaining part of their lives, redeeming the time; that ſo they may finally eſcape that condemnation to which they are expoſed, and that terrible deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power, which they cannot, otherwiſe, avoid in the day of his appearing? When that period ſhall arrive, alas! what will it avail any, to have <q>lived in pleaſure on the earth, and been wanton</q>? what, for a little while, to have nouriſhed their hearts, as "in a day of ſlaughter"?<note n="†" place="bottom">James v.5.</note> what, to have received that honor that cometh from men? what, to have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired great wealth, and large poſſeſſions in the world? yea, what, to have "gained the whole world", were
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:007487_0047_102b8f34d8dc6910"/>
that poſſible? Will the remembrance of former, guilty pleaſures, alleviate? or will it not rather embitter, the future torments of the wicked? Will the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of paſt honors, eſpecially of unmerited ones, ſooth the vanity of ungodly men, when they ſhall ariſe to "ſhame, and everlaſting contempt?" Will a reflection upon "riches gotten, and not by right," and which will then be no more, profit the miſer in the day of wrath; and make him rich towards God? Or, in fine, would the gain of the whole world profit him, whoſe ſoul is loſt by gaining it? and who now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives that ſame beloved world, even worſe than loſt to himſelf, diſſolving in flames and himſelf torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therein!</p>
            <p>LET irreligious and profane, let diſſolute, proud, ambitious and covetous men, if there are any ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, calmly and ſeriouſly think of theſe things, I beſeech them both by the mercies of God, and the terrors of the Lord; and by the love which they bear to themſelves. Go not on, <q>treaſuring up unto yourſelves wrath againſt this day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God; who will render to every man according to his deeds</q>—<q>unto them that obey unrighteouſneſs, indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguiſh</q>! Deſpiſe not the <q>riches of God's goodneſs, forbearance and long-ſuffering</q>, knowing that this goodneſs leadeth thee "to repentance." Contemn neither the gracious "promiſes, nor the awful threatnings of his word; for theſe are neither "cunningly deviſed fables",
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:007487_0048_102b8f370a55ef60"/>
nor fooliſh, "idle tales"; but the oracles of infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wiſdom, truth and righteouſneſs: And <q>the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens ſhall reveal the iniquity, and the earth riſe up againſt</q> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Job. 20.27.</note> the folly of thoſe, who practically diſregard them! Neglect not, therefore, the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity which you now enjoy for making your peace with God, thro' his own dear Son, who <q>was made ſin for you</q>, "taſting death for every man". For if thou deſpiſeth the revelation both of God's wrath and of his mercy; if thou hardeneſt thy neck and thy heart againſt him, ſetting at naught all his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and reproof; if thou doſt thus, think not, O man! whoſoever thou art, that thou ſhalt finally <q>eſcape his righteous judgment</q>. Thou wilt call upon him, at a time when he will not anſwer: thou wilt ſeek him early, but not find him.</p>
            <p>THERE is a hand conſtantly writing bitter things againſt the irreclaimable workers of iniquity; not, indeed, upon the decaying "walis" <note n="†" place="bottom">Dan. 5.5.</note> of their palaces or dwellings; but on tables more durable than braſs or adamant! the eternal leaves of thoſe <q>books which ſhall be opened</q>, when the <q>dead, ſmall and great, ſhall ſtand before God</q>, to be <q>judged out of the things which are written in the books, according to their works</q>. <note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. 20.12.</note> And though the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful, the fooliſh and wicked ſervant, may now "ſay in his heart, My Lord delayeth his coming" <note n="§" place="bottom">Mat. 24.48.</note>; yet there is Another who has ſaid, Behold!

            <p>BUT this, ſurely, is a ſubject, in which good men are concerned, as well as the wicked and diſobedient. For ſince we all expect ſuch things, the diſſolution of the world, and eternal judgment, this ought to quicken the beſt of men in their preparations for the day of God; to put them upon cleanſing themſelves, as far as is conſiſtent with the nature of the preſent ſtate, from <q>all filthineſs of fleſh and ſpirit, perfecting holineſs in the fear of God</q>. Accordingly the apoſtle does not ſay, <q>What manner of perſons ought ye to be</q>, in this or the other particular virtues or graces of chriſtianity <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <note n="†" place="bottom">Col. 3.13, 14.</note>. It is, if I miſtake not, more eſpecially to good men, the ſincere followers of Chriſt, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> addreſſes himſelf, in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing language, juſt after the text: <q>Wherefore, belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſays he, ſeeing ye look for ſuch things, be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent that ye may be found of him in peace, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpot and blameleſs</q>. <note n="†" place="bottom">Ver. 14.</note> It is great labour and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, an eminent degree of ſanctity, and chriſtian
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:007487_0050_102b8f3af341d380"/>
perfection, which the apoſtle expreſſes, and to which he exhorts us in theſe words:— <q>Be diligent—with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpot, and blameleſs</q>. Even good men are often far more "ſlothful" in the great buſineſs of human life; and leſs "fervent in ſpirit", while they are "ſerving the Lord", than they ought to be. They have ſometimes very conſiderable "ſpots" and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes, in their lives and religious characters; ſuch as are juſtly "blameable" in the ſight of God; and the conſciouſneſs of which, could not but give them great diſquietude, and prevent their having peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility of mind, were they actually to ſee the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven, in the glory of his father, and all the holy angels with him. St. <hi>Peter,</hi> therefore, here admoniſhes us to be diligent in getting rid of all ſuch ſpots, and ſtains, and blemiſhes; to cleanſe ourſelves from every kind and degree of ſin; from all unrighteouſneſs; from every thing unbecoming our holy profeſſion: That, being thus <q>blameleſs and harmleſs, the Sons of God without rebuke</q>, and <q>ſhining as lights in the world</q>, we may poſſeſs our ſouls in pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in expectation of the future judgment, &amp; the diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of all things: That we may enjoy a ſettled calm, and ſerenity of ſoul, in a conſciouſneſs of the rectitude of our hearts and manners: And that, inſtead of being terrified and amazed, and filled with anxious fears and apprehenſions, ſhould our Lord ſuddenly appear, we might then lift up our heads with peace, and even with confidence and joy, knowing that our redemption, which before drew nigh, is now actually come.</p>

               <pb n="53" facs="unknown:007487_0051_102b8f3cb28578c0"/>THIS, I ſuppoſe, is St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s meaning.

For it can ſcarce be conceived poſſible for a chriſtian, who thus walks with God; who walks by faith, and not by ſight; whoſe converſation is thus habitually in heaven, <q>from whence he alſo looks for the Saviour;</q> for one, whoſe fellowſhip is thus with the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt; and who is thus made perfect in love, and love in him; I ſay, it can ſcarce be conceived poſſible for ſuch a perſon to be thrown into any great perturbation of ſpirit, and filled with anguiſh and amazement, though he ſhould ſee the heavens which have received, again opened to reveal, the Son of man; though he ſhould behold him deſcending in flaming fire; though he ſhould find the earth tottering and failing under him; the world diſſolving around him; the powers of heaven ſhaken over him, and the ſtars falling, <q>as a fig-tree caſting her untimely figs, when ſhe is ſhaken of mighty winds!</q> No: I ſhould rather think that ſuch a man as is deſcribed above, would then lift up his head with joy, welcoming this day of God, and his deſcending Saviour with an— <q>Hoſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na in the higheſt!

For ſurely, it is not the abſence, but the preſence of a friend and beloved object, that is pleaſing and delightful to us. And if we loved our bleſſed Redeemer as perfectly as we ought to do, and ſerved him as faithfully, I am perſwaded this would not only inſpire us with boldneſs in the day of his appearing; but alſo with joy unſpeakable and full of glory. And if we did not love this world and the things of it, beyond due meaſure, the proſpect thereof diſſolving in flames, could miniſter neither grief nor terror to us; even though the preſent viſible heavens periſhed with them: Eſpecially ſince we, according to our Lord's promiſe, look both for new heavens and a <q>new earth, wherein dwelleth righteouſneſs.</q>

               <pb n="57" facs="unknown:007487_0055_102b8f44a1c971d0"/>BUT let me now cloſe this ſubject with ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections relative to thoſe late occurrences in divine providence, which led my thoughts to it. We have had ſeveral viſitations of the ſame ſort, in this country, before; ſome of which have not been inconſiderable: And, indeed, no EARTHQUAKE can, in itſelf, be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted ſo. An Earthquake is, in its own nature, awful, and terrifying to the mind of man, even tho', comparatively ſpeaking, it may be ſmall. He that will turn an Earthquake into a jeſt, and make light of it; or he who will pretend to out-brave one, and to preſerve an unruffled mind when the foundations of the world are ſhaken under him; (unleſs it be upon the principles of religion, of faith and hope in God) he that can do thus, I ſay, ought to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a fool or a mad-man; and, accordingly, to have an apartment aſſigned to him in bedlam by authority, if his friends and relations ſhould not take proper care of him. But though, as was ſaid above, we, in this country, have divers times before been viſited and admoniſhed in this way; yet I think it is generally acknowledged, that the firſt of the late Earthquakes, was both greater, and of longer conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, than any other which has been known amongſt us; the effects of it, which I need not enumerate to you, being certainly much more conſiderable. I ſhall ſay nothing concerning the natural cauſe, or cauſes of Earthquakes, which may perhaps be vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:007487_0056_102b8f472a619fe8"/>
that being, as I apprehend, quite foreign from the buſineſs of preaching, and therefore, at beſt, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent in a ſermon upon ſuch an occaſion. But I muſt juſt remind you, that all things and events, whether natural or preternatural, are under one, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, uniform DIRECTION, unleſs there is either no God, or more than One. The conſequence of which is, that even natural effects and events, are to be traced up to this ſupreme, original cauſe of all things, whoſe counſel and providence govern the world; and His hand, to be acknowledged in them.</p>
            <p>MY buſineſs, therefore, is to make a religious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of theſe viſitations of divine providence: And, by the aſſiſtance and bleſſing of Him, who <q>doeth great things paſt finding out, and wonders without number,</q> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Job ix.10.</note> to ſet home upon, and fix in your minds and conſciences, thoſe ſentiments of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which ought to be, and I doubt not are, in ſome meaſure, awakened therein, by theſe occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences; thoſe ſentiments concerning the power, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and univerſal dominion of God, and your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence upon him; thoſe ſentiments concerning the great buſineſs of human life; concerning death, a future ſtate, the diſſolution of all things, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal judgment; which theſe diſpenſations of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence are ſo naturally adapted to produce in the minds, and to impreſs upon the conſciences of men.</p>
            <p>As the natural and moral world are under one and the ſame common direction or government; ſo God's
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:007487_0057_102b8f48b3c00c00"/>
end in all things, however various and diverſe, is really one and uniform. There is a ſubordination of one thing to another; and a vaſt apparent variety amongſt them; but there is alſo a connection and dependence of one with and upon, another; and all tend to the ſame point at laſt; the moral perfection and happineſs of creatures capable of it, or the glory of God; which, in any good and intelligible ſenſe, ſeems to amount to the ſame thing. Accordingly, even we can ſee innumerable things in God's natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral government over the world, and in the common courſe of his providence, which are wiſely ordered with reſpect to his moral government; being ſuited and adapted, conſidering what our frame is, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, not a ſuperſtitious fear, but a juſt reverence of Him, in the minds of men; a religious ſenſe of his wiſdom, power and goodneſs; and of the obligations which we are under to him; that is, in others words, to promote religion and righteouſneſs amongſt men: So that the ultimate end of them is moral, tho' the things themſelves may be, and are natural; and tho' other ſubordinate ends may generally, if not always, be anſwered by them in God's natural government; the whole of which, as was intimated before, is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to his moral, and conducted with a view thereto. Thus all thoſe effects, however natural, common and familiar, which diſplay the perfections and glory of God, are plain, though ſilent admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his providence, to reverence and love, to adore and ſerve him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="unknown:007487_0058_102b8f4b66e74e08"/>BUT in this light we may more eſpecially conſider whatever effects or events in the natural world, are ſtupendous and great; and which, partly from their unuſualneſs, tho' not wholly ſo, but from their natural majeſty and grandeur alſo, ſtrike the mind with a certain awe and ſolemnity, better known than it can be deſcribed or explained. All theſe things, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when any apprehenſion of harm or danger is connected with them, have a peculiar tendency to lead our thoughts up to the great Creator, Upholder, and Governor of the univerſe: And a ſucceſſion of them, at proper intervals, contributes not a little, as I imagine, to rouſe the attention of mankind to, and fix it upon, thoſe things of a moral and religious concernment, which ought to be attended to even without them; and ſo to preſerve that ſenſe of God and religion in the world, which, without them, would, perhaps, be loſt out of it in a few generations. For ſuch is the make of man, that if all things ſhould go on in the world in one even, uniform manner and tenor, nothing of this ſort occuring from one age to another, to alarm and arreſt our attention, it is not unlikely that mankind would grow forgetful of God; and, by degrees, fall into a total ſcepticiſm and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity; the certain conſequence of which, is great depravity of manners. Nor is it unworthy of obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here, that the reaſon which thoſe <q>ſcoffers, walking after their own luſts</q>, ſpoken of in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text; who ſay, <q>Where is the promiſe of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</q> that the reaſon, I ſay, which they aſſign for
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:007487_0059_102b8f4d4afa12e8"/>
their infidelity and ſcepticiſm is,— <q>Since the fathers fell aſleep, all things <hi>continue as they were</hi>
               </q> —<note n="†" place="bottom">Ver. 4.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I WILL hazard the imputation of ſuperſtition ſo far as to confeſs, that when I get into this train of thought and reflection, which is not ſeldom, I cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what I have now been mentioning, <hi>viz.</hi> the turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of mens thoughts and attention to God, as the moral, ultimate end of remarkable tempeſts; of great ſtorms of wind, thunder, lightning and hail, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at unuſual ſeaſons of the year; of luminous and ſtrange appearances in the ſky and heavens; of the aurora borealis, comets and blazing meteors; of the mighty ſwellings, roarings and inundations of the ſea, which are ſometimes obſerved; of the erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of volcanos; and more eſpecially of Earthquakes. Theſe, and ſuch-like things, I doubt not, are all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned in providence to awaken the attention of a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, ſinful world, from time to time, to religion. And tho' we have not the leaſt reaſon to think them preter-natural; yet thoſe muſt have but very low and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy conceptions of the infinite wiſdom of God, who imagine he could not have originally planned, adjuſted and adapted them, to the moral ſtate of the world; ſo that, without any miraculous interpoſition of his, they ſhould occur at ſuch times and places, in all ſucceeding generations, wherein they would beſt ſubſerve the ultimate end of his government. And if this is the caſe, it is plain that exactly the ſame religious improvement is to be made of them, as if
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:007487_0060_102b8f4ed321e360"/>
they were the immediate, preternatural exertions of his power. And, indeed, ſo little are we able to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate into, or fully to comprehend their cauſes, and laws, that I had almoſt call'd them a ſort of <hi>natural miracles;</hi> the general, moral and ultimate deſign of which, is the ſame with that of preter-natural, or real ones.</p>
            <p>SOME of the things mentioned, have a more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate tendency than others of them, to promote religion in the world; I mean thoſe which, by putting us in fear for ourſelves, and by ſenſibly and directly convincing us of our own weakneſs and dependent condition, lead us to almighty God as our only refuge, and the great object of our truſt; giving us, at the ſame time, a demonſtration more convincing than any merely rational one, of the danger of offending him: <q>Put them in fear, O Lord! ſays the Pſalmiſt, that that the nations may know themſelves to be but men.</q> And when men once throughly know themſelves to be but men, weak, helpleſs, dependent creatures, they cannot well help knowing alſo, that God is GOD; the mighty Lord and Sovereign of all, who doeth his will in the heavens above, in the earth below, and "in all keep places"; and conſequently, that it is equally their duty and intereſt, by reverenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and obeying him, to ſecure his favour and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. When we behold the majeſty of God in the ſtormy wind and tempeſt, while <q>his voice maketh the hinds to calve</q>, rending the lofty ſons of the foreſt, and the very rocks and mountain, in pieces;
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:007487_0061_102b8f51059a7e78"/>
when we behold the mighty works of God in the ſea, and upon the dry land; how he either raiſeth or ſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the waves and raging of the one; and ſhaketh the other with his nod, or bids it be reſt, and it obeys; when we behold theſe, and ſuch-like manifeſtations of God's power <note n="*" place="bottom">"There is no power but of God," in a Senſe different from that which ſeems to be originally intended by the apoſtle. Secondary cauſes, as we term them, do not act independently of Him. In true philoſophy, as well as in religion, all the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of power which we behold, are only ſo many manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the power of Him, of <q>whom, and through whom, and to whom are all things.</q>
               </note> and majeſty, I ſay, it is not poſſible for the moſt ſceptical of us to doubt, whether it is not a thing of the laſt importance to us to be the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of his favour and loving-kindneſs; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to reverence him, and to do his will, as the way to become ſo.</p>
            <p>IT is evident that this is actually, in ſome degree, the moral effect of theſe ſtupendous manifeſtations of God's power, in the courſe of his providence; which, by the way, is one argument that this is the moral end of them. An Earthquake, in particular, has all the force of a thouſand ſyllogiſms, addreſſed merely to the underſtanding. It at once ſpeaks to, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces the heart; finding, if I may ſo expreſs it, a ſhorter and directer road to a man's conſcience, than that which lies thro' his head, in which there are often many meanders and labyrinths. It makes a man at once ſee and feel that he is nothing; and that God is all, and in all. Tho' void of reaſon, it reaſons more effectually than an Apoſtle; or, at leaſt, ſhakes
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:007487_0062_102b8f528e4002a0"/>
thoſe out of their irreligious, ſceptical principles, for a time, who are proof againſt other arguments. Or, if peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have not before been poſitive diſbelievers of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a God, of a future ſtate, and of religious obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in general; but only too inattentive to theſe things in a practical ſenſe, thro' the cares and pleaſures of this life, and the deceitfulneſs of riches; in this caſe, I ſay, ſuch a viſitation of providence, brings theſe important truths home to mens breaſts and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it immediately and unanſwerably convicts them of their improvidence and guilt, in having been thus unmindful of the God that made them, whoſe they are, and whom they ought to ſerve; in whoſe hands their breath is, and whoſe are all their ways. It gives them a feeling, tho'rough apprehenſion of the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ſtate of thoſe, who are the objects of God's righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous diſpleaſure; and, at the ſame time, a lively ſenſe of the happineſs of good men, who are at peace with their Maker, and the objects of his peculiar love; thoſe who are the care of his providence, and by being ſo, ſecure againſt all real harm, tho' the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and the earth were both diſſolved.</p>
            <p>THAT theſe ought in reaſon to be the moral ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, produced by ſuch occurrences in providence, is indiſputably certain: And that they are in fact ſo, in ſome degree, need I attempt any formal proof? Will it not be ſufficient only to appeal to the breaſts and conſciences of my hearers? Recollect, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, thoſe thoughts and ſentiments, (if it is poſſible they ſhould have ſo ſoon gone out of your minds)
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:007487_0063_102b8f54a94b7110"/>
Recollect, I ſay, thoſe thoughts and ſentiments which you ſo lately had, when your houſes over and under you, and the earth under them, ſeemed to be falling to ruins; and not unlikely to bury you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, either alive or dead. Is there a ſinner preſent, whoſe thoughts and heart were not immediately lifted up to God in the heavens? unleſs, perhaps, he was ſo great a one, that he had not confidence enough to do it; which, I hope, was not the ſad caſe of any of us! Is there any one, whoſe heart was ſo ſtubborn as not to relent? and who did not at leaſt wiſh, that he had always lived under an habitual ſenſe of religion, working out his ſalvation with fear and trembling; that ſo he might have his refuge in God, at a time when other help was vain? Is there a wicked man, whoſe heart did not at that time accuſe and upbraid him? and tremble within him, under the apprehenſions of God's juſt diſpleaſure? Is there, whoſe thoughts did not <q>trouble him, ſo that the joints of his loins were looſed, and his knees ſmote one againſt another?</q> and whoſe counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance was not "changed," <note n="*" place="bottom">Dan. v.6.</note> like the impious <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Monarch's, when he beheld MENE TEKEL upon the ill-boding, prophetic wall, over his midnight bowls and revellings! Is there, who did not reſolve, that if that night of terror, were not the laſt of his life, it ſhould be the laſt which ſhould find him a worker of iniquity, and an enemy to his God!</p>
            <p>YEA, I may aſk, whether there is even a good man

amongſt us, whoſe heart remained intirely undaunted, fully "fixed, and truſting in the Lord," in that night of general conſternation? and who had no uneaſy apprehenſions, reſpecting another world, ariſing from conſcious deficiences in the diſcharge of his duty? However, I am far from ſaying or thinking that this is impoſſible: Nay, I am fully perſwaded that it is poſſible: Though I am equally perſwaded, that through a certain conſtitutional timidity and fearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and through ſinful imperfection, there are but few chriſtians, comparatively ſpeaking, who actually attain to ſuch a ſtability of faith, hope, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in God; eſpecially when thus ſurprized in their beds, and awaking with the proſpect of imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate deſtruction before them.

People of all ranks, good and bad, high and low, rich and poor, have been very gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and very juſtly, awakened to think more on God, and the "things that belong to their peace," than they ſeemed to do but juſt before. Thoſe who were before ſecure and profligate, are, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, apparently rouzed into a ſerious ſenſe of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: And thoſe who, as we have reaſon to hope, were, before, truly pious, have hereby been anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to run their chriſtian courſe with more ſpeed and diligence; that ſo they may be ready at whatever hour their Lord may either come, or call them out of the world; <q>whether at even, or at midnight, at the cock-crowing, or in the morning.</q> Theſe are the preſent, viſible, and good effects of theſe provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential diſpenſations; and ſuch as God intended in them. For they are undoubtedly monitory in their nature and true deſign: And if they are not regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any, as being ſo, I believe it muſt be thoſe only, who do not believe there is really any univerſal providence over, or moral government eſtabliſhed in the world; which is the ſame thing, in other words, with atheiſm.</p>
            <p>THE great danger now is, leſt theſe religious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, however deep they may ſeem to be for the preſent, ſhould be gradually effaced from the hearts
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:007487_0066_102b8f5acd7075d0"/>
of people; and leave them, in a little time, as they found them: which is often, if not generally the caſe. Your great care, therefore, ſhould now be, by recollection, and ſerious, ſober conſideration, with the bleſſing of God, to keep alive in your breaſts thoſe ſentiments concerning Him, yourſelves, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world, and the great buſineſs of life, which have been thus awakened in you.</p>
            <p>LET me therefore beſeech thoſe, whoſe minds have been ſeriouſly impreſs'd by theſe viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of providence, not to ſuffer theſe good impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to wear off almoſt as ſoon as the earth ceaſes to tremble under them; which it has, indeed, as yet ſcarcely done! Cheriſh and improve them, by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation and prayer, into a rational, ſubſtantial prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of practical religion and holineſs; ſuch a one as ſhall be permanent, and productive of good fruits, in the remaining part of your ſpared lives. For I muſt remind you, that a ſudden fright is not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of a ſinner's ſoul to God; nor the terrors and reproaches of a guilty conſcience, the ſame thing with being "born of the ſpirit." Let not thoſe, therefore, who cannot but think they were "in the gall of bitterneſs and bond of iniquity," before they were awakened by theſe admonitions of providence, if there are any ſuch preſent; let not ſuch, I ſay, too ſuddenly conclude, that the "bitterneſs of death is paſt" with them; nor too ſlightly heal the wounds of their bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſciences, by ſpeaking peace to themſelves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

God ſpeaks it to them by his word and Spirit. There is need of your being cautioned againſt this; and even of your being cautioned againſt returning to your old ſins, as ſoon as your preſent fears and terrors are a little abated, as the <q>dog returneth to his vomit;</q> your goodneſs proving only like the "morning cloud, and early dew;" though you may now imagine that you ſhall never forget thoſe things which have made ſo deep an impreſſion upon you; and conclude your "path" will ſurely be that of the <q>juſt, which, like the ſhining light, ſhineth more and more, unto the perfect day.</q> Give all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to make your "calling and election ſure," by attending upon all the means of grace; and, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly by prayer to God for his Holy Spirit. For you cannot create yourſelves <q>anew in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works.</q> It is God who muſt, by his concurrence and energy, cleanſe you from all unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, <q>through ſanctification of the ſpirit unto obedience,</q> as it is He alone that can forgive your ſins, "through the redemption that is in Chriſt." And you have reaſon to hope that he will do both, if you diligently ſeek him, and <q>call upon him while he is near:</q> And he may properly be ſaid to be now ſo near you, whom he has awakened by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and Spirit, into a ſerious ſenſe of religion, ſo that your greateſt concern is, to eſcape his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved wrath, and to obtain an intereſt in his lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-kindneſs, which is better than life.

wiſh and prayer is, that you may aſk till you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; that you may ſeek till you find; and knock till it is opened unto you; and that this good work may be "perfected unto the day of Chriſt." And remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that if, after being thus awakened to think ſoberly of God, and your eternal intereſt; if after beginning well, you ſhould again return to ſin and folly, your latter end will be far "worſe than the beginning".

and whence he may again come <q>at ſuch an hour as we think not.</q> At leaſt, we cannot tell how ſoon or ſuddenly we may be taken out of this world, by ſome means or other. And this reflection ſhould make us diligent in the improvement of our time and talents here; that when the important period comes for us to go to the world of ſpirits, we may be fit to join the bleſſed ſociety of "juſt men made perfect." The viſible things, which are made, are all at length to be ſhaken, <q>that thoſe things which cannot be ſhaken may remain.

            <p>IN fine; Let us all in common, by theſe ſolemn warnings and admonitions of providence; (for we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but account them ſuch; indications of God's righteous diſpleaſure, and loud calls to a univerſal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of manners) Let us all in common, I ſay, and chuſe to repeat it, <q>by theſe ſolemn warnings and admonitions of providence,</q> be excited ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to conſider of our ways; to reform what is amiſs in ourſelves; and diligently to attend to the great and ultimate buſineſs of human life; which is the fearing of God, and keeping his commandments: For this is the "whole of man", and the <q>concluſion of the whole matter.</q> Do you imagine that God has no more Earthquakes at command! and even
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:007487_0070_102b8f62d4fdcf50"/>
far more terrible and fatal ones, with which, not only to chaſtiſe, but even to deſtroy, a guilty, irreclaimable people, if He pleaſes!—Let theſe providential and judicial viſitations, inſpire us therefore, not only now, but always, with a due reverence, and with awful thoughts of the inconceivable greatneſs, power and majeſty of Him, who <q>removeth the mountains, and they know not</q>; who <q>taketh up the iſles as a very little thing</q>; who <q>ſitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as groſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers; who ſtretcheth out the heavens as a curtain</q>; who is equally able, and equally determined, to ſave the righteous, and to deſtroy the wicked. Till we think in ſome meaſure worthily of God, we ſhall not think "ſoberly of ourſelves, as we ought to think"; nor conduct ourſelves with due lowlineſs, humility, and reverence towards Him. Theſe diſpenſations of his providence, are peculiarly adapted to this moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant end; to ſhow us all, how intirely we are in God's hands, and at his diſpoſal; how much it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us to fear and ſerve him; and <q>what manner of perſons we ought to be in all holy converſation and godlineſs; looking for, and haſting unto, the coming of the day of God</q>; that great day, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in "all theſe things ſhall be diſſolved".</p>
            <p>THOUGH an Earthquake may naturally lead our tho'ts to this important period; yet ſurely it is not to be compared, in reſpect of the terrors of it, to the terrors of that day, when the earth, with the works
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:007487_0071_102b8f65ae36cb98"/>
that are therein, ſhall be burnt up; the elements melt with fervent heat; the heavens themſelves being on fire, diſſolved; and He, who was once crucified with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the gates of Jeruſalem, ſhall be revealed in the glory of his Father, to take juſt vengeance on the world of the ungodly. This ſcene ſhall yours, and mine, and "every eye", one day behold; when both the maſked hypocrite, who now covereth his tranſgreſſions; and the unmaſked profligate, whoſe <q>ſins are open before-hand, going before to judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</q>, ſhall equally receive the due reward of their deeds; the cunning craftineſs of the one, and the brazen effrontery and impudence of the other, utterly forſaking him; and leaving him to his deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perdition! How will thoſe wicked, ungodly men, endure the terrors of that day, whom only the quaking of the earth, now throws into conſternation and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh? If we cannot now poſſeſs our ſouls in patience, in a calm reſignation of ourſelves into the hands of God; or be awaked from ſleep in our beds by an Earthquake, without ſuch amazement; what inexpreſſible aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment will ſeize the wicked, who ſhall be awaked from their "ſleep in the duſt of the earth", by the voice of the arch-angel, and the trump of God? and when the firſt objects which their eyes behold, will be their mighty Judge coming in the clouds, and the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and earth diſſolving in flames! We read how courageous the greateſt and boldeſt ſinners; thoſe who would think the imputation of wanting courage and fortitude, the greateſt reproach to them; I ſay, we
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:007487_0072_102b8f679194fde8"/>
read how courageous theſe mighty men of valour will be in this day of trial, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.— <q>And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and every bond-man, and every free-man, hid themſelves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains: And ſaid to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that ſitteth upon the throne, and from the wrath of the lamb; for the great day of his wrath is come; and who ſhall be able to ſtand!</q> —</p>

            </p>
            <p>LET us, my Brethren, willingly lay under the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of being perſons of weak minds, who give way to ſuperſtious fears and fancies, rather than defy the God that is above, or reject the record which he has given of his Son; rather than tread under foot, Him that loved us, and redeemed us to God by his blood;
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:007487_0074_102b8f6b0bc96520"/>
than diſregard the commandments of Him, who <q>being made perfect, is become the author of eternal ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to all them that obey Him</q>! Let us now guard againſt the fears and terrors, the unutterable confuſion and anguiſh, which will come as a whirlwind upon the guilty nations, in the day of God! Let us, having believed in God, maintain good works; being holy in all converſation and godlineſs; without ſpot and blameleſs: For doing thus, we ſhall be found of Him in peace. And if we are thus prepared for that great day, we need not, ſurely, be very anxious about an Earthquake already paſt, or for fear that others ſhould arrive. They that could undauntedly behold "all theſe things diſſolving", and the Son of man coming with power and great glory, may certainly poſſeſs their ſouls in peace and patience for the preſent; ſaying with the Pſalmiſt, as God grant we may all be able to ſay in ſincerity, and holy confidence—<q>God is our refuge and ſtrength; a very preſent help in trouble: Therefore will not we fear, tho' the earth be removed, and tho' the mountains be carried into the midſt of the ſea: tho' the waters thereof roar, and be troubled; though the mountains ſhake with the ſwelling thereof. There is a river, the ſtreams whereof ſhall make glad the city of God; the holy place of the tabernacle of the moſt High: GOD is in the midſt of her; SHE SHALL NOT BE MOVED!</q>

            <head>APPENDIX, Containing a more particular Account of the late terrible Earthquake, than has yet been publiſhed amongſt us.</head>
            <p>IT will not be improper here, by way of appendix, to give ſome account of the late terrible Earthquake; as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding diſcourſes may poſſibly fall into the hands of ſome, who have not met with any. This brief account ſhall be arranged, for the ſake of perſpicuity, under the following heads; viz. the time, the duration, the proceſs, the extent, and the effects of the Earthquake: Though one or two remarks may, perhaps, be made, which do not directly and properly fall under either of theſe particulars.</p>
            <p>THE Earthquake, I mean the firſt and greateſt of the three lately felt at <hi>Boſton,</hi> was on tueſday, <hi>Nov.</hi> 18. 1755, between 4 and 5 o'clock in the morning; the evening and night preceeding having been calm, ſerene and pleaſant; and ſuch a great white-froſt being upon the ground in the morning, as I have not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for many years paſt. By reaſon of the difference in peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples clocks and watches, they differ at leaſt a quarter of an hour as to the preciſe time when the ſhock came on; ſome making it but 15 minutes, and others more than 30, after 4 o'Clock. The former, I believe, come neareſt the truth; and, probably, do not fix the time more than 3 or 4 minutes too late, if at all.</p>
            <p>AS to the duration, or continuance of the Earthquake, people alſo differ widely; viz. from 1 minute to 6 or 7. I have very good reaſon to think, that they who fix it at a minute and half, or two minutes at moſt, allow time enough.</p>
            <p>THE proceſs of the earthquake was as follows. It began with a ſmart pulſation of the earth upwards: I mean this was the firſt motion perceived; for thoſe who were awake, generally agree that there was a ruſhing, rumbling noiſe, a little before any motion was felt. This pulſation was immediately ſucceeded by a uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal trembling, or very quick, jarring, vibratory motion, which was horizontal. This motion increaſed for about a quarter of a minute; and then abated for two or three ſeconds. Then came on, all at once, a violent, prodigious ſhock, as ſuddenly to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, as a thunder-clap breaking upon a houſe; and attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a great noiſe. This ſudden and great ſhock was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:007487_0076_102b8f6fd3ab1478"/>
followed by quick and violent concuſſions, jerks and wren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, attended, as it appeared to me, with an undulatory, waving motion of the whole ſurface of the ground, not unlike the ſhaking and quaking of a very large bogg. Theſe concuſſions and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings continued at, or very near, their height, for almoſt the ſpace of half a minute. And were ſo great as to make it difficult for thoſe who were ſtanding or walking, to keep their feet; and, as I am informed, quite impracticable for ſome. After this great ſhock had been gradually declining and going off, near half a minute, there was a very perceptible revival of it, though of no continuance; and ſo all became, by degrees, ſtill and quiet, in a little more, perhaps, than 1 minute &amp; ½ from the firſt ſymptoms of the Earthquake. This is the moſt exact account I can give of its beginning, progreſs and ending, from my own obſervation compared with the accounts of others.</p>
            <p>THE extent of this Earthquake along the ſea-coaſt, from S. W. to N. E. was, probably, about 800 or 900 miles; for it cannot certainly be determined at preſent. The province of the <hi>Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts</hi>-Bay, ſeems to have been the center of it. By what we hear from <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> about 300 miles diſtant upon a direct line, the ſhock was inconſiderable, in compariſon of what it was here; and leſs than it was at <hi>New-York.</hi> So that it ſeems pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, it did not reach towards the S. W. beyond <hi>Virginia.</hi> We hear nothing of it, I think, from <hi>Hallifax</hi>; ſo that we may conclude it was very little, if at all, perceived there. The hithermoſt part of <hi>Nova-Scotia</hi> may therefore be reckoned its N. eaſterly boundary; for we are morally certain that it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended near, if not quite ſo far, by what we hear concerning it in ſeveral parts of the intermediate ſpace. It is more difficult to aſcertain its eaſtern and weſtern limits; or its extent back into the inland country, and out at ſea. It extended to all our back ſettlements, from which we have heard; to Lake-<hi>George</hi>; and, probably, hundreds of miles beyond. And the ſhock was ſo great in the <hi>Atlantic,</hi> 70 leagues E. of this <hi>American</hi> continent, that the people on board a veſſel in that longitude, thought they had run a-ground, or ſtruck upon a rock. From whence we may naturally conclude, that this was not the moſt eaſterly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of it by ſeveral hundred miles. And upon the whole it ſeems probable, that a circle of 900 miles diameter would have hardly incloſed it: Eſpecially conſidering that it might run in veins and caverns of the earth, much farther one way than another. I ſhall juſt add here, though it may not, perhaps, be the propereſt place for the remark, that the Earthquake ſeems to have come from the S. W. and to have catch'd along, (if I may ſo expreſs it) thro' this part of the continent, as though a
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:007487_0077_102b8f715cdd7b08"/>
train had been laid for it from country to country. For moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts we have from the S. W. make the ſhock conſiderably ſooner there, than we had it here, and than it was felt to the N. E. of us; ſo much ſooner, that the difference of longitude will ſcarce help us at all in accounting for it.</p>
            <p>BEFORE I proceed to the effects of this Earthquake, I ſhall juſt mention the two others which were felt in <hi>Boſton</hi> after it. One on the ſame morning, about an hour and a quarter after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; very generally perceived, though comparatively ſmall; its continuance not exceeding 15 ſeconds at moſt. The other was on the ſaturday evening following, about half an hour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 9 o'Clock. This was as much more conſiderable than the laſt on tueſday morning, as that was leſs conſiderable than the firſt. It came on gradually, with a ruſhing noiſe; as it alſo went off. It was attended with a waving, undulatory motion, as well as a vibratory; its duration ſcarce half a minute. Many other ſhocks have been felt ſince the firſt and the greateſt, to the eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and northward of <hi>Boſton</hi>; at 20, 30, 40 and 50 miles diſtance, if not farther. From the diverſity there was both as to the time and degree of the firſt Earthquake, along this conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent; and from the numbers of others that have been perceived to a conſiderable degree in ſome places, and not at all in places diſtant but a few miles from them, we may naturally infer theſe two things: That the immediate natural cauſe, whatever it be, is (or rather was) not uniform, and aequi-diſtant from the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the ground: And, that it was not very remote from the ſurface, in ſome places. Had either of theſe been the caſe, it is at leaſt probable, that there would have been a greater uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, conſent and agreement, in the time, ſenſation and effects, than there has been. But not to digreſs farther.</p>
            <p>THE principal viſible effects (I mean the phyſical effects) of the Earthquake, are now to be mentioned. Theſe are not, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, exactly the ſame, and equally great, in all places within its verge and limits; as was intimated before. In <hi>Boſton,</hi> beſides the throwing down of glaſs, pewter, and other moveables in the houſes, about an 100 chimnies, perhaps, were in a manner le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd with the roofs of the houſes: and about 1500 ſhattered, and thrown down in part. Some were broken off ſeveral feet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the top, and by the ſuddenneſs and violence of the jerks. canted horizontally an inch or two over, ſo as to ſtand very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly. Some others, thus broken off, were turned round ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral points of the compaſs, as with a circular motion. The roofs of ſome houſes were quite broken in by the fall of chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. The ends of about 12 or 15 brick buildings were thrown down, from the top to the eaves of the houſes. Many clocks
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:007487_0078_102b8f733863b310"/>
were ſtopped; and ſome wells and pumps became immediately dry. The vane upon the publick Market-houſe was thrown down; the wooden ſpindle which ſupported it, though of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable thickneſs, and which had ſtood the moſt violent guſts of wind, being broken off. A new vane upon one of the churches in the town, is bent at the ſpindle which paſſes through it, 2 or 3 points of the compaſs out of its proper direction; which muſt have been done by a very quick and violent horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal motion. And "A diſtiller's ciſtern, made of plank, almoſt new, and very ſtrongly put together, was burſt to pieces by the agitation of the liquor in it; which was thrown out with ſuch force as to break down one whole ſide of the ſhed that defended the ciſtern from the weather, as alſo to ſtave off a board or two from a fence, at the diſtance of 8 or 10 feet from it."</p>
            <p>SIMILAR effects to theſe, were ſeen out of the town of <hi>Boſton</hi>; and ſome others. Great damage has been ſuſtained in the country towns, by throwing down the ſtone-wall fence. But what is ſtill more alarming than any thing already mentioned, is the breaches and chaſms made in the ground, in ſeveral places; no leſs than four or five in the ſingle town of <hi>Pembroke;</hi> out of ſome of which chaſms the water has iſſued; and many cart-loads of a fine, whiteiſh, and compreſſible ſort of ſand, has been ſpewed; and, by what I have heard, of a ſulphureous nature. And ſprings, it is ſaid, are opened in ſeveral parts of the country, which continue flowing; and ſome old ones dried up. It is credibly reported, that the ground in one or two places, either upon or near <hi>Cape-Cod,</hi> is apparently ſunk down; ſome, I think, ſay, ſeveral feet. It is alſo reported that a great hill upon the ſame <hi>Cape,</hi> is ſplit in halves; and ſtands yawning in a hideous manner. We have alſo had an account of a prodigious chaſm made in the ground at <hi>Newington</hi> in <hi>New-Hamſphire,</hi> of 60 rods in length, and near 2 feet in breadth. But of the truth of theſe two laſt mentioned facts, I am leſs certain.</p>
            <p>WHEN we reflect ſeriouſly upon the danger we have been in, were it only by the falling of chimnies, we muſt account it a very great favour, not to ſay wonder, in providence, that neither the life nor limb of any perſon, has been loſt by means of the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake! So violent was this concuſſion, that had it continued at its greateſt height a minute, it is eaſy to tell what muſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a miracle to prevent it, have been the ſad effect;—the throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down of almoſt all our brick and ſtone buildings; and the burying of thouſands in their ruins:—I mean, if ſomething ſtill more awful, which I leave to be gueſs'd at, had not enſued!</p>
            <p>BUT we hear of one effect of the Earthquake at ſea, which is ſtill more uncommon, tho' leſs alarming to us, than theſe upon
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:007487_0079_102b8f75508e8298"/>
the land. For ſeveral of our ſea-faring men agree in their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, that almoſt immediately after the earthquake, large num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of fiſh of different ſorts, both great and ſmall, came up to the ſurface of the water, ſome dead, and others dying. I am credibly informed that one of our fiſhing veſſels, at that time out upon the banks, took up, and brought in, ſeveral Quintals of theſe fiſh. And ſome aſſert, that even the whales have not wholly eſcaped this deſtruction.</p>
            <p>THUS do <q>they that go down to the ſea in ſhips, that do buſineſs in great waters,</q> 
               <q>ſee the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep</q>; while we behold them upon the dry land.—And it were well if both they and we, took a proper notice of them—<q>O Lord! how manifold are thy works! in wiſdom but thou made them all. The earth is full of thy riches. So is this great and wide ſea, wherein <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> things creeping innumer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able both ſmall and great beaſts. There go the ſhips, there is that Leviathan whom thou haſt made to play therein. Theſe wait all upon dice; that thou mayeſt give them their meat in due ſeaſon. That thou giveſt them, they gather: thou open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thine hand, they are filled with good. Thou hideſt thy face, they are troubled: thou takeſt away their breath, they die, and return to their duſt!</q>
