            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Thus far proceeds CONRAD WEISER'S Account.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now give the beſt Account I could collect, of their <hi>RELIGION,</hi> and <hi>Form of GOVERNMENT.</hi> As to their <hi>RELIGION,</hi> It appears from ſeveral Paſſages in their Treaties with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that they believe in <hi>One GOD,</hi> the Creator of the Univerſe; that there is a future State of Rewards and Puniſhments; the Influence of evil Spirits upon human Actions. As a Reward to the firſt Founders of their Union, they believe them to be now Gods in Heaven. Their Form of Worſhip I have not learnt. Upon the Whole, they ſeem to be the beſt Sort of <hi>Deiſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their <hi>Form of GOVERNMENT,</hi> is a Council of their oldeſt and wiſeſt Men, who have been great Warri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours: Every one of the <hi>Six Nations</hi> have ſuch a Council, in which all Matters relating to that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are determin'd: And if it is of great Moment, they conſult their young Warriours, and the Buſineſs is debated with great Deliberation. In Foreign Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, which relate to the Union in general, every one of the <hi>Six Nations</hi> ſends Deputies out of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, to a General Council; and this General Council, as well as the Particular Ones, conſult the young Warriours, and have their Concurrence, before any Matter of great Conſequence is determined. All their Debates in Council, are manag'd with great Decency and Deliberation; and the Reſolution is imprinted in 
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:005417_0009_10182C32712E6888"/>
the Memory of One choſen from among them, of great Reputation and Elocution, who is appointed to ſpeak in Publick. He is aſſiſted by a Prompter, who puts him in Mind of any Thing he forgets. They have no coercive Power over their young Warriours; they can only perſuade and admoniſh; nor have they any Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment but Death; Crimes that by their Laws do not deſerve that, are forgiven, after proper Reproofs.</p>
            <p>When any Propoſals are made by them, in their Treaties with the white People, or by the white Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to them, they make the <hi>Io—hau,</hi> or Shout of <hi>Approbation,</hi> which is performed thus: The Speaker, after a Pauſe, in a ſlow Tone pronounces the <hi>U—huy</hi>; all the other <hi>Sachems</hi> in perfect Silence: So ſoon as be ſtops, they all with one Voice, in exact Time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin one general <hi>Io',</hi> raiſing and falling their Voices as the Arch of a Circle, and then raiſe it as high as at firſt, and ſtop at the Height at once, in exact Time; and if it is of great Conſequence, the Speaker gives the <hi>U—huy</hi> thrice, and they make the Shout as often. It is uſual, when the white Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſpeak to them, as they give a Belt or String of <hi>Wampum,</hi> for the <hi>Interpreter</hi> to begin the <hi>U—huy,</hi> and the <hi>Indians</hi> to make the Shout.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Six Nations,</hi> as was obſerved before, border upon the Provinces of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> and <hi>New-York:</hi> The reſt, which are mentioned as their <hi>Dependents</hi> and <hi>Allies,</hi> lye near the <hi>French</hi> Settlements, ſome amidſt, and ſome beyond them. The <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of the <hi>Chiefs</hi> in this <hi>Conſederacy</hi> hath gained them no leſs <hi>Reputation</hi> than their <hi>courage</hi>; which indeed has ſtruck <hi>Terror</hi> into the remoteſt <hi>Indian</hi> Nations of North <hi>America,</hi> and forc'd them to court the Friendſhip and Protection of ſuch a formidable Power.</p>

The <hi>Moderation</hi> and <hi>Equity</hi> of the <hi>firſt</hi> Proprietor of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> gained the abſolute Confidence and Affection of this <hi>brave People:</hi> They were convinced of his <hi>Tenderneſs</hi> for them, and in Return they have erected him laſting Monuments in their grateful Hearts: They <hi>revere</hi> this good Man's <hi>Memory,</hi> and his Praiſes will only <hi>ceaſe</hi> with the Nations them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>The following Clauſes from a Collection of <hi>Charters,</hi> &amp;c. printea at <hi>Philadelphia 1740,</hi> are, amongſt many others, ſtrong Proofs of the <hi>Proprietor</hi>'s equitable Regard to theſe People.</p>
            <q>
               <p>That no Man, <hi>ſays he,</hi> ſhall by any Ways or Means, in Word or Deed, affront or wrong any <hi>Indian</hi>; but he ſhall incur the ſame Penalty of the Law, as if he had committed it againſt his <hi>fellow Planter:</hi> And if any <hi>Indian</hi> ſhall abuſe, in Word or Deed, any <hi>Planter</hi> of this <hi>Province,</hi> that he ſhall not be his own Judge upon the <hi>Indian</hi>; but he ſhall make his Complaint to the <hi>Governor</hi> of the <hi>Province,</hi> or his <hi>Lieutenant</hi> or <hi>Deputy,</hi> or ſome inferior <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> near him; who ſhall, to the utmoſt of his Power, take Care, with the KING of the ſaid <hi>Indian,</hi> that all reaſonable Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction be made to the ſaid injured <hi>Planter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That all Differences between the <hi>Planters</hi> and the <hi>Natives,</hi> ſhall alſo be ended by <hi>Twelve Men,</hi> that is, by <hi>Six Planters</hi> and <hi>Six Natives,</hi> that ſo we may live friendly together, as much as in us lieth, preventing all Occaſions of Heart-burnings and Miſchief.</p>
            </q>
            <p>A Conduct regulated by ſuch Principles of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> could not fail to influence this diſcerning 
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:005417_0011_10182C37534FDCE8"/>
People, and biaſs them in favour of the <hi>ENGLISH;</hi> a Continuance of the like Conduct muſt attach them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violably: And the preſent worthy <hi>Governor</hi> and <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> ſeem ſo ſenſible of the Neceſſity of cultivating a good Underſtanding with the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> as to be likely to omit no Opportunity of <hi>brightening the Chain,</hi> or <hi>increaſing the Fire of Friendſhip</hi> with them.</p>
            <p>The Confidence which theſe Nations repoſe in their <hi>Interpreter,</hi> is a Proof of his <hi>Induſtry, good Senſe,</hi> and <hi>Addreſs:</hi> Nothing could have happened more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Settlements, than that thoſe delicate Affairs ſhould be in the Hands of a Perſon equally juſt, and a Friend to both.</p>
            <p>The <hi>FRENCH</hi> are perpetually labouring to <hi>debauch</hi> their Faith to the <hi>ENGLISH:</hi> Their Emiſſaries, the Prieſts, an indefatigable, artful, inſinuating Race, are conſtantly labouring to gain Admittance amongſt them. They aſſume all Shapes, try every Spring; they mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify the Power and Grandeur of <hi>FRANCE;</hi> they ſtudy to render the <hi>ENGLISH</hi> diminutive and contemptible; they foment every little Occaſion of Diſguſt, and leave no Stone unturned to prejudice us in their Eſteem.</p>
            <p>Hitherto the Honour of the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> and the experienced good Intentions and Probity of the <hi>ENG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LISH,</hi> have been a ſufficient Barrier againſt all their Intrigues: But it cannot be imprudent to countermine the intended Miſchief, by giving ſuitable Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to proper Perſons, to converſe with the <hi>Indians,</hi> and ſtudy their Genius. An open-hearted Generoſity wins them effectually: The Temper of the <hi>ENGLISH</hi> is happily ſuited to this; and the additional Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Integrity</hi> and <hi>Prudence,</hi> muſt in Time pave the Way to an Aſcendency in their Councils; and by this Means the Subtilty of the <hi>FRENCH</hi> would be utterly defeated.</p>

One ſees, in the following ſhort Sketch of the Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the <hi>Indians,</hi> ſtrong Traces of <hi>good Senſe,</hi> a <hi>nice Addreſs</hi> in the Conduct of their Affairs, a <hi>noble Simplicity,</hi> and that <hi>manly Fortitude</hi> which is the conſtant Companion of <hi>Integrity.</hi> The Friendſhip of a Nation like this, tho' under the Appellation of <hi>Savages</hi> or <hi>Barbarians,</hi> is an Honour to the moſt civiliz'd Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: I ſay nothing of the Advantage which is derived from them by Commerce: And the <hi>FRENCH</hi> well know, by dear Experience, how terrible they are to their Enemies in War.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Honourable Gentlemen, Commiſſioners for the Governments of</hi> Virginia <hi>and</hi> Maryland, <hi>and BRETHREN, Sachems or Chiefs of the</hi> Indians <hi>of the</hi> Six Nations,</p>
                  <p>At a Treaty held by me two Years ago, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the Government of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> with a Number of the Chiefs of the <hi>Indians</hi> of the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> I was deſired by them to write to the Government of <hi>Maryland,</hi> concerning ſome Lands in the back Parts of that Province, which they 
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:005417_0016_10182C4B78FB8258"/>
claimed a Right to, from their Conqueſts over the antient Poſſeſſors, and which have been ſettled by ſome of the Inhabitants of that Government, without their Conſent, or any Purchaſe made from them.</p>
                  <p>It was at that Time underſtood, That the Claim was upon <hi>Maryland</hi> only; but it has ſince appeared, by ſome Letters formerly wrote by Mr. Preſident <hi>Logan,</hi> to the late Governor of <hi>Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that it related likewiſe, to ſome Lands in the back Parts of <hi>Virginia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Governors of thoſe Colonies ſoon manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a truly equitable Diſpoſition, to come to any reaſonable Terms with the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of thoſe Lands; and deſired, that, for that End, a Time and Place might be fixed for a Treaty with them.</p>
                  <p>But before this cou'd be effected, an unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Skirmiſh happened, in the back Parts of <hi>Virginia,</hi> between ſome of the Militia there, and a Party of the <hi>Indian</hi> Warriors of the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> with ſome Loſs on both Sides. Who was the Aggreſſors, is not at this Time to be diſcuſſed, both Parties having agreed to bury that Affair in Oblivion; and the Government of <hi>Virginia,</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in Token of the Continuance of their Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, preſented the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> through my Hands, with Goods to the Value of One Hundred Pounds <hi>Sterling,</hi> to prevent further Hoſtilities, and to heal this Breach.</p>
                  <p>I had, before the Preſent was given, made a Tender of my good Offices, which both Parties accepted, and conſented, on my Inſtances, to lay down their Arms: Since which, the Faith pledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me has been mutually preſerved, and a

Time and Place has been agreed upon, through my Intervention, for accommodating all Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and for ſettling a firm Peace, Union, and Friendſhip, as well between the Government of <hi>Virginia,</hi> as that of <hi>Maryland,</hi> and the <hi>Indians</hi> of the <hi>Six Nations.</hi>

                  <p>Theſe <hi>Indians,</hi> by their Situation, are a Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier to ſome of them; and from thence, if Friends, are capable of defending their Settlements; if E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, of making cruel Ravages upon them; if Neuters, they may deny the <hi>French</hi> a Paſſage through their Country, and give us timely Notice of their Deſigns.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are but ſome of the Motives for cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a good Underſtanding with them, but from hence, the Diſadvantages of a Rupture are abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly

evident. Every Advantage you gain over them in War, will be a Weakening of the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier of thoſe Colonies, and conſequently be, in Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, Victories over yourſelves, and your Fellow Subjects. Some Allowances for their Prejudices and Paſſions, and a Preſent now and then, for the Relief of their Neceſſities, which have, in ſome Meaſure, been brought upon them, by their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with us, and by our yearly extending our Settlements, will probably tye them more cloſely to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Intereſt.</p>
                  <p>This has been the Method of <hi>New-York,</hi> and <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> and will not put you to ſo much Expence in Twenty Years, as the carrying on a War againſt them will do, in One.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> very well know the Importance of theſe Nations to us; and will not fail by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, and their other uſual Arts, to take Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of any Miſunderſtandings we may have with them.</p>
                  <p>But I will detain you, Gentlemen, no longer; your own ſuperior Knowledge will ſuggeſt to you, more than I can ſay, on this Subject.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>FRIENDS and BRETHREN, Sachems or Chiefs of the</hi> Indians <hi>of the Six Nations,</hi> Theſe, your Brethren of <hi>Virginia</hi> and <hi>Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> are come to enlarge the Fire which was almoſt gone out, and to make it burn clearer, to brighten the Chain which had contracted ſome Ruſt, and to renew their Friendſhip with you; which it is their Deſire, may laſt ſo long as the Sun, the Moon, and the Stars ſhall give Light.</p>
                  <p>Their Powers are derived from the great King of <hi>England,</hi> your Father, and whatever Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions 
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005417_0019_10182C52659A1558"/>
they ſhall come to with you, will be as firm and binding, as if the Governors of theſe Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were themſelves here.</p>
                  <p>I am your Brother, and, which is more, I am your true Friend: As you know from Experience that I am ſo, I will now give you a few Words of Advice.</p>
                  <p>Receive theſe your Brethren with open Arms; unite yourſelves to them in the Covenant Chain, and be you with them as one Body and one S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ul.</p>
                  <p>I make no Doubt, but the Governor of <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> has been taking Pains to widen the Breach between theſe, your Brethren of <hi>Virginia,</hi> and you; but as you cannot have forget the Hatred the <hi>French</hi> have always born to your Nations, and how kindly on the contrary you have been treated, and how faithfully you have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected by the great King of <hi>England,</hi> and his Subjects, you will not be at a Loſs to ſee into the Deſigns of that Governor. He wants to divide you from us, the more eaſily to deſtroy you; which he will moſt certainly do, if you ſuffer your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be deluded by him.</p>
                  <p>As to what relates to the Friendſhip, eſtablith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed between the Government of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> and your Nations, I will take another Day to ſpeak to you upon it.</p>
               </q>
               <p>And to enforce what had been ſaid, the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor laid down a Belt of <hi>Wampum</hi>; upon which, the <hi>Indians</hi> gave their uſual Cry of Approbation.</p>
               <p>After a ſhort Pauſe, the Governor ordered the Interpreter to tell the <hi>Indians,</hi> That as they had greatly exceeded their appointed Time of meeting 
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:005417_0020_10182C584A0239B0"/>
the Commiſſioners, he recommended to them, to uſe all the Expedition poſſible, in giving their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to what had been ſaid, that they might forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with proceed to treat with the reſpective Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, on the Buſineſs they came about.</p>
               <p>Then the Governor addreſſed himſelf to the Honourable Commiſſioners, in the following Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>GENTLEMEN, the Honourable the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of</hi> Virginia <hi>and</hi> Maryland, If, in the future Courſe of this Treaty, my good Offices ſhall be thought uſeful, you may moſt aſſuredly rely upon them.</q>
               <p>For which Speech, all the Commiſſioners return'd the Governor their Thanks.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Canaſateego</hi> repeated to the Interpreter, the Subſtance of what the Governor had ſpoke, in order to know if he had underſtood him right; a Method always made Uſe of by the <hi>Indians:</hi> And when the Interpreter told him, he had taken the true Senſe, <hi>Canaſateego</hi> proceeded to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the Thanks of the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> for the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor's kind Advice, promiſing to follow it, as far as lay in their Power; but as it was their Cuſtom, when a Belt was given, to return another, they would take Time till the Afternoon, to provide One, and would then give their Anſwer.</p>

                  <p>But ſince there are ſome Diſputes between us, reſpecting the Lands poſſeſſed by them, which formerly belonged to us; we, according to our Cuſtom, propoſe to have thoſe Differences firſt adjuſted, and then we ſhall proceed to confirm the Friendſhip ſubſiſting between us, which will meet with no Obſtruction, after theſe Matters are ſettled.</p>

Here they preſented the Governor with a Belt of <hi>Wampum,</hi> in Return for the Belt given them in the Morning, by the Governor.</p>
               <p>Then the Governor, in Reply, ſpoke as follows:</p>
               <q>I receive your Belt with great Kindneſs and Affection; and as to what relates to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Virginia</hi> and <hi>Maryland,</hi> the Honourable Commiſſioners now preſent, are ready to treat with you. I ſhall only add, that the Goods for the Hundred Pounds <hi>Sterling,</hi> put into my Hands by the Governor of <hi>Virginia,</hi> as a Token of his good Diſpoſition to preſerve Friendſhip with you, are now in Town, and ready to be delivered, in Conſequence of what was told you by <hi>Conrad Weiſer,</hi> when he was laſt at <hi>Onondago.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>Then the Governor, turning to the Commiſſioners of <hi>Virginia</hi> and <hi>Maryland,</hi> ſaid,</p>

                     <hi>GENTLEMEN,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have now finiſhed what was incumbent upon me to ſay, by way of Introduction, to the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>; and as you have full Authority from your reſpective Governments, to treat with them, I ſhall leave the reſt entirely to you, and either ſtay, or withdraw, as you ſhall think it moſt for your Service.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The Commiſſioners ſaid, they were all of Opinion, it would be for their Advantage to have the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor to ſtay with them; and therefore, they una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly deſired he would favour them with the Continuance of his Preſence, while they ſhould be
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005417_0023_10182C6360165B00"/>
in Treaty with the <hi>Indians:</hi> Which, his Honour ſaid, he would, at their Inſtance, very readily do, believing it might expedite their Buſineſs, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any Jealouſy the <hi>Indians</hi> might conceive, at his withdrawing.</p>
               <p>The Commiſſioners of <hi>Maryland</hi> ordered the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter to acquaint the <hi>Indians,</hi> that the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of <hi>Maryland</hi> was going to ſpeak to them; and then ſpoke as follows:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>FRIENDS and BRETHREN, of the united</hi> Six Nations,</p>
                  <p>We who are deputed from the Government of <hi>Maryland,</hi> by a Commiſſion under the Great Seal of that Province, now in our Hands, and which will be interpreted to you, bid you welcome; and, in Token that we are very glad to ſee you here as Brethren, we give you this String of <hi>Wampum.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Here the uſual Cry of Approbation was given,</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>When the Governor of <hi>Maryland</hi> received the firſt Notice, about Seven Years ago, of your Claim to ſome Lands in that Province, he thought our Friends and Brethren of the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> had little Reaſon to complain of any Injury from <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryland</hi>; and that they would be ſo well convinc'd thereof, on further Deliberation, as he ſhould hear no more of it: But you ſpoke of that Matter again to the Governor of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> about two Years ſince, as if you deſigned to terrify us.</p>
                  <p>It was very inconſiderately ſaid by you, <hi>That you would do yourſelves Juſtice, by going to take Payment yourſelves.</hi> Such an Attempt would
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:005417_0024_10182C656CE6E368"/>
have intirely diſſolved the Chain of Friendſhip, ſubſiſting not only between us, but perhaps be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the other <hi>Engliſh</hi> and you.</p>
                  <p>We aſſure you, our People, who are numerous, courageous, and have Arms ready in their Hands, will not ſuffer themſelves to be hurt in their Lives and Eſtates.</p>
                  <p>But however, the old and wiſe People of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryland,</hi> immediately met in Council; and upon conſidering, very cooly, your raſh Expreſſion, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to invite their Brethren, the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> to this Place, that they might learn of them, what Right they have to the Land in <hi>Maryland</hi>; and, if they had any, to make them ſome reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Compenſation for it.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, the Governor of <hi>Maryland</hi> has ſent us to meet and treat with you, about this Affair, and the brightening and ſtrengthening the Chain, which hath long ſubſiſted between us; and as an Earneſt of our Sincerity and good Will towards you, we preſent you with this Belt of <hi>Wampum.</hi>

               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Here the Cry of Approbation was given.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>Our great King of <hi>England,</hi> and his Subjects, have always poſſeſſed the Province of <hi>Maryland,</hi> free and undiſturbed from any Claim of the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> for above One Hundred Years paſt; and your not ſaving any Thing to us before, convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces us, you thought you had no Pretence to any Lands in <hi>Maryland.</hi> Nor can we yet find out, to what Lands, or under what Title, you make your Claim.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>Suſquehannah Indians,</hi> by a Treaty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Ninety Years ſince, which is on the Table, 
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005417_0025_10182C6A65D735C8"/>
and will be interpreted to you, <hi>GIVE</hi> and <hi>YIELD,</hi> to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, their Heirs and Aſſigns for ever, the greateſt Part, if not all, of the Land we poſſeſs, from <hi>Patuxent</hi> River, on the <hi>Weſtern,</hi> as well as from <hi>Choptank</hi> River, on the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Side of the great Bay of <hi>Cheſapeak:</hi> And near Sixty Years ago, you acknowledged to the Governor of <hi>New-York,</hi> at <hi>Albany,</hi> That you had given your Lands, and ſubmitted yourſelves, to the King of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We are that great King's Subjects, and we poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs and enjoy the Province of <hi>Maryland,</hi> by Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his Right and Sovereignty thereto: Why then will you ſtir up any Quarrel between you and ourſelves, who are as one Man, under the Protection of that great King?</p>
                  <p>We need not put you in Mind of the Treaty, which, we ſuppoſe, you have had from your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, made with the Province of <hi>Maryland,</hi> near Seventy Years ago; and renewed and confirmed twice ſince that Time.</p>
                  <p>By theſe Treaties, we became Brethren: We have always liv'd as ſuch, and hope always to continue ſo.</p>
                  <p>We have this further to ſay, that altho' we are not ſati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>For this Purpoſe, we have brought with us a Quantity of Goods, for our Brethren the <hi>Six Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and which will be delivered you, as ſoon as we ſhall have received your Anſwer, and made

                  <p>We have now freely and openly laid our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms bare to you; and that you may be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter confirmed of the Truth of our Hearts, we give you this Belt of <hi>Wampum.</hi>

               <p>After a little Time, <hi>Canaſateego</hi> ſpoke:</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>BROTHER, the Governor of</hi> Maryland, We have heard what you have ſaid to us; and as you have gone back to old Times, we cannot give you an Anſwer now; but we ſhall take what you have ſaid into Conſideration, and return you an Anſwer ſome Time To-morrow.</q>
               <p>He then ſat down; and after ſome Time, ſpoke again:</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>BROTHER, the Governor of</hi> Maryland, If you have made any Enquiry into <hi>Indian</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, you well know, that we have always had our Guns, Hatchets, and Kettles mended, when ever we come to ſee our Brethren: Brother <hi>Onas,</hi> and the Governor of <hi>New-York,</hi> always do this for us; and we give you this early Notice, that we may not thereby be delayed, being deſirous, as well as you, to give all poſſible Diſpatch to the Buſineſs, to be tranſacted between us.</q>
               <p>The Commiſſioners of <hi>Virginia</hi> and <hi>Maryland</hi> ſaid, ſince it was cuſtomary, they would give Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to have every Thing belonging to them mended, that ſhould want it.</p>

                  <hi>BROTHER, the Governor of</hi> Maryland, When you invited us to kindle a Council-Fire with you, <hi>Conedogrvanict</hi> was the Place agreed upon; but afterwards, you, by our Brother <hi>Onas,</hi> on ſecond Thoughts, conſidering that it wou'd be difficult to get Proviſions, and other Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, where there were but few Houſes or Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, deſired we wou'd meet you our Brethren at <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and at his Inſtance we very readily agreed to meet you here, and are glad of the Change: For we have found Plenty of every Thing, and as yeſterday you bid us welcome, and told us you were glad to fee Us; we likewiſe aſſure you, we are glad to ſee you, and in Token of our Satisfaction, we preſent you with this String of <hi>Wampum.</hi>

                     <hi>Brother the Governor of</hi> Maryland, <hi>by the Advice of theſe wiſe Men, has ſent up to brighten the Chain, and to aſſure us of his Willingneſs to remove whatever impedes a good Underſtanding between us.</hi> This ſhews, that your wiſe Men underſtood our Expreſſions in their true Senſe.</p>
                  <p>We had no Deſign to terrify you, but to put you on the doing us the Juſtice you had ſo long delayed: Your wiſe Men have done well, and as there is no Obſtacle to a good Underſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us, except this Affair of the I and, we, on our Parts, do give you the ſtrongeſt Aſſurances of our good Diſpeſition towards you; and that we are as deſirous as you, to brighten the Chain, and to put away all Hinderances to a perfect good Underſtanding: And in Token of our Sincerity, we give you this Belt of <hi>Wampum.</hi>

                     <hi>BROTHER, the Governor of</hi> Maryland, When you mentioned the Affair of the Land Yeſterday, you went back to old Times, and told us, you had been in Poſſeſſion of the Province of <hi>Maryland,</hi> above One Hundred Years; but what is a Hundred Years, in Compariſon of the Length of Time ſince our Claim began? Since we came out of this Ground? For we muſt tell you, that long before a Hundred Years, our Anceſtors came out of this very Ground, and their Children have remained here ever ſince.</p>
                  <p>You came out of the Ground in a Country that lies beyond the Seas; there you may have a juſt Claim, but here you muſt allow us to be your elder Brethren, and the Lands to belong to us long before you knew any Thing of them.</p>

                  <q>It is true, that above One Hundred Years ago the <hi>Dutch</hi> came here in a Ship, and brought with them ſeveral Goods, ſuch as Auls, Knives, Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chets, Guns, and many other Particulars, which they gave us: And when they had taught us how to uſe their Things, and we ſaw what Sort of People they were, we were ſo well pleaſed with them, that we tied their Ship to the Buſhes on the Shore; and afterwards, liking them ſtill bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the longer they ſtaid with us, and thinking the Buſhes too ſlender, we removed the Rope and tied it to the Trees; and as the Trees were liable to be blown down by high Winds, or to decay of themſelves, from the Affection we bore them, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain removed the Rope, and tied it to a ſtrong and big Rock:</q> 
                  <hi>Here, the Interpreter ſaid, they mean the</hi> Oncido <hi>Country.</hi> 
                  <q>And not content with this, for its further Security, we removed the Rope to the big Mountain,</q> 
                  <hi>Here, the Interpreter ſays, they mean the</hi> Onondago <hi>Country.</hi> 
                  <q>and there we tied it very faſt, and rolled <hi>Wampum</hi> about it; and to make it ſtill more ſecure, we ſtood upon the <hi>Wampum,</hi> and ſat down upon it, to defend it, and to prevent any Hurt coming to it, and did our beſt Endeavours, that it might remain unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd for ever.</q>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>During all this Time, the New-comers the <hi>Dutch,</hi> acknowledged our Right to the Lands, and ſollicited us from time to time, to grant them part of our Country, to enter into League and Covenant with us, and to become one People with us.</p>
                  <p>After this, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> came into the Country, and as we were told, became one People with the <hi>Dutch:</hi> About two Years after the Arrival of
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:005417_0031_10182C7B7A55CEB0"/>
the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Governor came to <hi>Albany</hi>; and finding what great Friendſhip ſubſiſted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and the <hi>Dutch,</hi> he approv'd it mightily, and deſired to make as ſtrong a League, and to be upon as good Terms with us, as the <hi>Dutch</hi> were, with whom he was united, and to become one People with us; and by his further Care in looking into what had paſs'd between us, he found, That the Rope which tied the Ship to the great Mountain, was only ſaſt'ned with <hi>Wampum,</hi> which was liable to break and rot, and to periſh in a Courſe of Years: He therefore told us, that he would give us a Silver Chain, which wou'd be much ſtronger, and wou'd laſt for ever: This we accepted, and ſaft'ncd the Ship with it, and it has laſted ever ſince.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, we have had ſome ſmall Differences with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and during theſe Miſunderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſome of their young Men wou'd, by way of Reproach, be every now and then telling us, that we ſhou'd have periſhed, if they had not come into the Country, and furniſhed us with Strowds, Hatchets, Guns, and other Things neceſſary for the Support of Life: But we always gave them to underſtand, that they were miſtaken; that we liv'd before they came amongſt us, and as well or better, if we may believe what our Fore-fathers have told us: We had then Room enough, and Plenty of Deer, which was eaſily caught; and tho' we had not Knives and Hatchets, and Deer, ſuch as we have now, yet we had Knives of Stone, and Hatchets of Stone, and Bows and Arrows, and theſe ſerv'd our Uſes, as well then, as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ones do now: We are now ſtraightned, and ſometimes in want of Deer, and liable to 
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:005417_0032_10182C811E17B088"/>
many more Inconveniences, ſince the <hi>Engliſh</hi> came among us, and particularly from that Pen and Ink Work, that is going on at the Table; and we will give you an Inſtance of this.</p>
                  <p>Our Brother <hi>ONAS,</hi> a great while ago came to <hi>Albany,</hi> to buy the <hi>Suſquehannah</hi> Lands of us; but our Brother the Governor of <hi>New-York,</hi> who, as we ſuppoſe, had not a good Underſtanding with our Brother <hi>Onas,</hi> adviſed us not to ſell him any Land, for he wou'd make an ill Uſe of it; and pretending to be our good Friend, he adviſed us, in order to prevent <hi>Onas,</hi> or any other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons impoſing upon us, and that we might always have our Land when we ſhou'd want it to put it into his Hands; and told us, he wou'd keep it for our Uſe, and never open his Hands, but keep them cloſe ſhut, and not part with any of it, but at our Requeſt.</p>
                  <p>Accordingly, we truſted him, and put our Land into his Hands, and charged him to keep it ſaſe for our Uſe: But ſome Time after, he went away to <hi>England,</hi> and carried our Land with him, and there ſold it to our Brother <hi>Onas,</hi> for a large Sum of Money; and when, at the Inſtance of our Brother <hi>Onas,</hi> we were minded to ſell him ſome Land, he told us, we had ſold the <hi>Suſquehannah</hi> Lands already, to the Governor of <hi>New-York,</hi> and he had bought them from him in <hi>England</hi>; tho' when he came to underſtand, how the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of <hi>New-York</hi> had deceived us, he very generonſly paid us for our Lands over again.</p>
                  <p>Tho' we mention this Inſtance of an Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion put upon us, by the Governor of <hi>New-York,</hi> yet we muſt do the <hi>Engliſh</hi> the Juſtice to ſay, We have had their hearty Aſſiſtance, in our Wars

                  <p>We now come nearer home: We have had your Deeds interpreted to us, and we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge them to be good and valed; and that the <hi>Coneſtogo</hi> or <hi>Suſquehan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Since you have join'd with the Governor of <hi>Maryland,</hi> and Brother <hi>Onas,</hi> in kindling this Fire, we gladly acknowledge the Pleaſure we have, in feeing you here, and obſerving your good Diſpoſitions, as well to confirm the Treaties of Friendſhip, as to enter into further Contracts about Land, with us: And in Token of our Satisfaction, we preſent you with this String of <hi>Wampum.</hi>

                     <hi>BROTHER Aſſaraquoa,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In your Speech this Morning, you were plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſay, We had wrote a Letter to <hi>James Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,</hi> about Eight Years ago, to demand a Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration for our Lands, in the Poſſeſſion of ſome of the <hi>Virginians</hi>; that you held them, under 
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:005417_0038_10182C9316197C68"/>
the great King, for upwards of One Hundred and Sixty Years, and that we had already given up our Right; and that therefore, you had deſired the Governor of <hi>New-York</hi> to ſend his Interpreter to us laſt Year, to <hi>Onondago,</hi> which he did; and, as you ſay, we, in Council at <hi>Onondago,</hi> did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, <hi>That we had no Demand on you for Lands; and that if we had any Pretenſions, we ſhould have made them known to the Governor of</hi> New-York.</p>
                  <p>And likewiſe, you deſire to know if we have any Right to the <hi>Virginia</hi> Lands; and that we will make ſuch a Right appear, and tell you what Nation of <hi>Indians</hi> we conquered thoſe Lands from.</p>
                  <p>Now we anſwer.</p>
                  <p>We have the Right of Conqueſt, a Right too dearly purchaſed, and which coſt us too much Blood, to give up, without any Reaſon at all, as you ſay we have done, at <hi>Albany.</hi> But we ſhou'd be oblig'd to you, if you would let us ſee that Letter, and inform us, who was the Interpreter, and whoſe Names are put to the Letter; for as the whole Tranſaction can't be above a Year's Standing, it muſt be freſh in every Bodies Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſome of our Council would eaſily remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it.</p>
                  <p>But we aſſure you, and are well able to prove, that neither we, nor any Part of us, have ever relinquiſhed our Right; or ever gave ſuch an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, as you ſay is mentioned in your Letter.</p>
                  <p>Cou'd we, ſo many Years ago, make a formal Demand by <hi>James Logan,</hi> and not be ſenſible of our Right? And hath any Thing happened ſince that Time, to make us leſs ſenſible? No: And 
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:005417_0039_10182C96C4535C60"/>
as this Matter can be eaſily cleared up, we are anxious it ſhou'd be done; for we are poſitive, no ſuch Thing was ever mentioned to us at <hi>Onondago,</hi> nor any where elſe.</p>
                  <p>All the World knows, we conquered the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Nations living on <hi>Suſquehanna, Cohongaronta,</hi> and on the Back of the great Mountains in <hi>Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia:</hi> The <hi>Conoy-uch-ſugh-roonoa, Coch-naw-waſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roonaw, Tohod-irough-roonow,</hi> and <hi>Canutſ-hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough-roonaw,</hi> feel the Effects of our Conqueſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now a Part of our Nations, and their Land at our Diſpoſal.</p>
                  <p>We know very well, it hath often been ſaid, by the <hi>Virginians,</hi> That the great King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the People of that Colony, conquered the <hi>Indians</hi> who lived there; but it is not true: We will allow, they have conquered the <hi>Sachdag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ugh-roonaw,</hi> and drove back the <hi>Tuſcaroras</hi>; and that they have, on that Account, a Right to ſome Part of <hi>Virginia:</hi> But as to what lies beyond the Mountains, we conquered the Nations reſiding there; and that Land, if ever the <hi>Virginians</hi> get a good Right to it, it muſt be by us. And in Teſtimony of the Truth of our Anſwer to this Part of our Speech, we give you this String of <hi>Wampum.</hi>

                  <p>We have given you a full Anſwer to the firſt Part of your Speech, which we hope will be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory: We are glad to hear you have brought with you a big Cheſt of new Goods, and that you have the Key in your Pockets. We do not doubt but we ſhall have a good Underſtanding in all

Points, and come to an Agreement with you. We ſhall open all our Hearts to you, that you may know every Thing in them; we will hide nothing from you. And we hope, that if there be any Thing ſtill remaining in your Breaſt, that may occaſion any Diſpute between us, you will take this Opportunity to unboſom your Hearts, and lay them open to us; that henceforth, there may be no Dirt or any other Obſtacle in the Road between us. And in Token of our hearty Wiſhes to bring about ſo good a Harmony, we preſent you with this Belt of <hi>Wampum.</hi>

                     <hi>BROTHER Aſſaraquoa,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We muſt now tell you what Mountains we mean, that we ſay are the Boundaries between you and us. You may remember, that about Twenty Years ago, you had a Treaty with us at <hi>Albany,</hi> when you took a Belt of <hi>Wampum</hi> and made a Fence with it on the Middle of the Hill, and told us, that if any of the Warriors of the <hi>Six Nations</hi> came on your Side of the Middle of the Hill, you would hang them; and you gave us Liberty to do the ſame with any of your Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who ſhould be found on our Side of the Middle of the Hill: This is the Hill we mean; and we deſire that Treaty may now be confirm'd.</p>
                  <p>After we left <hi>Albany,</hi> we brought our Road a great deal more to the <hi>Weſt,</hi> that we might comply with your Propoſal; but tho' it was of your own making, your People never obſerv'd it, but came and lived on our Side of the Hill; which we don't blame you for, as you live at a great 
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:005417_0041_10182C9D89F44B48"/>
Diſtance, near the Seas, and can't be thought to know what your People do in the back Parts: And on their ſettling, contrary to your own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, on our new Road, it fell out, that our War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors did ſome Hurt to your Peoples Caſtle; of which a Complaint was made, and tranſmitted to us by our Brother <hi>Onas</hi>; and we, at his Requeſt, altered the Road again, and brought it to the Foot of the great Mountains, where it now is: And it is impoſſible for us to remove it any further to the <hi>Weſt,</hi> thoſe Parts of the Country being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely impaſſable, by either Man or Beaſt.</p>
                  <p>We had not been long in the Uſe of this new Road, before your People came like Flocks of Birds, and ſat down on both Sides of it; and yet we never made a Complaint to you, tho' you muſt be ſenſible, theſe Things muſt have been done, by your People, in manifeſt Breach of your own Propoſal, made at <hi>Albany.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore, as we are now opening our Hearts to you, we cannot avoid complaining, and deſire all theſe Affairs may be ſettled: And that you may be the ſtronger induc'd to do us Juſtice for what is paſt, and to come to a thorough Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement for the future, we, in the Preſence of the Governor of <hi>Maryland,</hi> and Brother <hi>Onas,</hi> preſent you with this Belt of <hi>Wampum.</hi>

                  <hi>Which was received with the uſual Ceremony.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then <hi>Tachanoontia</hi> added, <q>He forgot to ſay, that the Affair of the Road muſt be look'd upon, as a Preliminary to be ſettled before the Grant of Lands; and that either the <hi>Virginia</hi> People muſt be oblig'd to remove more Eaſterly, or if they are
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:005417_0042_10182CA582CEAC78"/>
permitted to ſtay, that our Warriors, marching that Way to the Southward, ſhall go Sharers with them in what they plant.</q>

               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>FRIENDS and BRETHREN, of the</hi> Six Nations,</p>
                  <p>I am always ſorry, when any Thing happens, that may give you or us the leaſt Uneaſineſs; but as we are mutually engag'd, to keep the Road between us clear and open, and to remove every Obſtruction that may lye in the Way: I muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you, That three of the <hi>Delaware Indians,</hi> lately murdered <hi>John Armſtrong</hi> and <hi>Indian</hi> Trader, and his two Men, in a moſt barbarous Manner, as he was traveling to <hi>Alligany,</hi> and ſtole his Goods of a conſiderable Value.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Shikalamy,</hi> and the <hi>Indians</hi> ſettled at <hi>Shomockin,</hi> did well, they ſeized two of the Murders, and
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:005417_0043_10182CA7EB4BA228"/>
ſent them down to our Settlements; but the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> who had the Charge of them, afterwards ſuffered one of them to eſcape, on a Pretence, that he was not concern'd in the bloody Deed; the other is now in <hi>Philadelphia</hi> Goal.</p>
                  <p>By our Law, all the Acceſſaries to a Murder, are to be tried and put to Death, as well as the Perſon that gave the deadly Wound; if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to it, encouraged it, or any otherwiſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in it, they are to be put to Death; and it is juſt, it ſhou'd be ſo.</p>
                  <p>If upon Trial, the Perſons preſent at the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, are found not to have done any of theſe Things, they are ſet at Liberty.</p>
                  <p>Two of our People were, not many Years ago, publickly put to Death, for killing two <hi>Indians.</hi> We therefore expect, you will take the moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual Meaſures, to ſeize, and deliver up to us, the other two <hi>Indians,</hi> preſent at theſe Murders, to be tried with the Principal now in Cuſtody. If it ſhall appear, upon their Trial, that they were not adviſing, or any ways aſſiſting in this horrid Fact, they will be acquitted and ſent home to their Towns: And that you may be ſatisfied, no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice will be done to them, I do now invite you, to depute Three or more <hi>Indians,</hi> to be preſent at their Trials.</p>
                  <p>I do likewiſe expect, that you will order ſtrict Search to be made, for the Remainder of the ſtolen Goods, that they may be reſtor'd to the Wife and Children of the deceas'd.</p>
                  <p>That what I have ſaid, may have it's due Weight with you, I give you this String of <hi>Wampum.</hi>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Weiſer</hi> acquainted the <hi>Indians,</hi> That they might now look over the ſeveral Goods, plac'd on a Table in the Chamber, for that Purpoſe: And the Honourable Commiſſioners bid him tell them, if they diflik'd any of the Goods, or if they were

                     <hi>SACHEMS and Warriours of the</hi> Six Nations,</p>
                  <p>We are now come to anſwer what you ſaid to us Yeſterday, ſince what we ſaid to you before, on the Part of the great King our Father, has not been ſatisfactory.</p>
                  <p>You have gone into old Times, and ſo muſt we: It is true, that the great King holds <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia</hi> by Right of Conqueſt, and the Bounds of that Conqueſt to the Weſtward, is the great Sea.</p>
                  <p>If the <hi>Six Nations</hi> have made any Conqueſt over <hi>Indians,</hi> that may, at any Time have liv'd, on the Weſt Side of the great Mountains of <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia</hi>; yet they never poſſeſſed any Lands there, that we have ever heard: That Part was altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſerted, and free for any People to enter upon, as the People of <hi>Virginia</hi> have done, by order of the great King, very juſtly, as well by an antient Right, as by it's being freed from the poſſeſſion of any other; and from any Claim, even of you the <hi>Six Nations</hi> our Brethren, until within theſe eight Years.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Treaty between the great King, in behalf of his Subjects of <hi>Virginia,</hi> and you, that we can find, was made at <hi>Albany,</hi> by Colonel <hi>Henry Courſey,</hi> ſeventy Years ſince; this was a Treaty of Friendſhip, when the firſt Covenant Chain was made, when we and you became Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
                  <p>The next Treaty was alſo at <hi>Albany,</hi> about Fifty eight Years ago, by the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> Governor of <hi>Virginia</hi>; then you declare your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Subjects to the great King our Father; and gave up to him all your Lands, for his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="37" facs="unknown:005417_0049_10182CBDA29B4C78"/>
This you own in a Treaty, made by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of <hi>New-York</hi> with you, at the ſame Place, in the Year 1687, and you expreſs yourſelves in theſe Words:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>O Brethren, you tell us, the King of <hi>England</hi> is a very great King; and why ſhou'd you not join with us in a juſt Gauſe, when the</hi> French <hi>join with our Enemies in an unjuſt Cauſe? O Brethren, we ſee the Reaſon of this: For the</hi> French <hi>would kill us all, and when that is done, they wou'd carry all the Beaver Trade to</hi> Canada; <hi>and the great King of</hi> England <hi>wou'd loſe the Land likewiſe: And therefore, O GREAT SACHEM beyond the great Lakes, awake, and ſuffer not thoſe poor</hi> Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <hi>that have given themſelves, and their Lands, under your Protection, to be deſtroyed by the</hi> French <hi>without a Cauſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The laſt Treaty we ſhall ſpeak to you about, is that made at <hi>Albany</hi> by Governor <hi>Spotſwood,</hi> which you have not recited as it is; for the white People, your Brethren, of <hi>Virginia,</hi> are in no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of that Treaty, prohibited to paſs and ſettle to the <hi>Weſtward</hi> of the great Mountains: It is the <hi>Indians,</hi> tributary to <hi>Virginia,</hi> that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, as you, and your tributary <hi>Indians</hi> are, from paſſing to the <hi>Eaſtward</hi> of the ſame Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, or to the <hi>Southward</hi> of <hi>Cohongoronta</hi>; and you agree to this Article in theſe Words:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That the great River</hi> Potomack, <hi>and the high Ridge of Mountains, which extend all along the Frontiers of</hi> Virginia, <hi>to the</hi> Weſtward <hi>of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Settlements of that Colony, ſhall be, for ever, the eſtabliſhed Boundaries between the</hi> Indians, <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Dominion of</hi> Virginia, <hi>and the</hi> Indians <hi>belonging to, and depending on the</hi> Five Nations: 
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:005417_0050_10182CBF3074E840"/>
                     <hi>So that neither our</hi> Indians <hi>ſhall not, on any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence whatſoever, paſs to the</hi> Northward <hi>or</hi> Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>of the ſaid Boundaries, without having to produce a Paſport, under the Hand and Seal of the Governor or Commander in Chief of</hi> Virginia; <hi>nor your</hi> Indians <hi>paſs to the</hi> Southward <hi>or</hi> Eaftward <hi>of the ſaid Boundaries, without a Paſport in like Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, from the Governor or Commander in Chief of</hi> New-York.</p>
                  <p>And what Right can you have to Lands that you have no Right to walk upon, but on certain Conditions? It is true, you have not obſerved this Part of the Treaty, and your Brethren of <hi>Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> have not inſiſted on it with a due Strictneſs; which have occaſioned ſome Miſchief.</p>
                  <p>This Treaty has been ſent to the Governor of <hi>Virginia,</hi> by Order of the great King, and is what we muſt rely on; and being in Writing, is more certain than your Memory: That is the Way the white People have, of preſerving Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions of every Kind, and tranſmitting them down to their Childrens Children for ever; and all Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes among them are ſettled by this faithful kind of Evidence, and muſt be the Rule between the great King and you.</p>
                  <p>This Treaty your Sachems and Warriors ſign'd: Some Years after the ſame, Governor <hi>Spotſwood,</hi> in the Right of the great King, had been, with ſome of the People of <hi>Virginia,</hi> in Poſſeſſion of theſe very Lands, which you have ſet up your late Claim to</p>
                  <p>The Commiſſioners for <hi>Indian</hi> Affairs at <hi>Albany,</hi> gave the Account we mentioned to you Yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, to the Governor of <hi>New-York,</hi> and he ſent it to the Governor of <hi>Virginia</hi>; their Names will be given you by the Interpreter.</p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>BRETHREN,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Diſpute is not between <hi>Virginia</hi> and you; it is ſitting up your Right againſt the great King, under whoſe Grants the People you complain of are ſettled: Nothing but a Command from the great King can remove them: They are too pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful to be removed by any Force of you, our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; and the great King, as our common Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, will do equal Juſtice to all his Children: Wherefore we do believe, that they will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd in their Poſſeſſion.</p>
                  <p>As to the Road you mention, we intended to prevent any Occaſion for it, by making a Peace between you and the <hi>Southern Indians,</hi> a few Years ſince, at a conſiderable Expence to our great King; which you confirmed at <hi>Albany:</hi> It ſeems, by your being at War with the <hi>Catawbas,</hi> that it has not been long kept between you.</p>
                  <p>However, if you deſire a Road, we will agree to one, on the Terms of the Treaty you made with Colonel <hi>Spotſwood</hi>; and your People, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>having themſelves orderly, like Friends and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, ſhall be uſed, in their Paſſage thro' <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia,</hi> with the ſame Kindneſs as they are, when they paſs thro' the Lands of your Brother <hi>Onas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This, we hope, will be agreed to, by you, our Brethren; and we will abide by the Promiſe made to you Yeſterday.</p>
                  <p>We may proceed to ſettle what we are to give you, for any Right you may have, or have had, to all the Lands to the <hi>Southward</hi> and <hi>Weſtward</hi> of the Lands of your Brother the Governor of <hi>Maryland,</hi> and of our Brother <hi>Onas.</hi>
                  </p>

               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>BROTHER Aſſaraquoa,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The World at the firſt, was made on the other Side the great Water, different from what it is on this Side, as may be known from the different Colours of our Skin, and of our Fleſh; and that which you call Juſtice, may not be ſo amongſt us: You have your Laws and your Cuſtoms, and ſo have we: The great King might ſend you over to conquer the <hi>Indians,</hi> but it looks to us, that God did not approve of it; if he had, he would not have placed the Sea where it is, as the Limits between us and you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>BROTHER Aſſaraquoa,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Tho' great Things are well remembered among us, yet we don't remember that we were ever conquered by the great King; or that we have 
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:005417_0055_10182CD1C1A927D8"/>
been employed by that great King to conquer others: If it was ſo, it is beyond our Memory. We do remember we were employed by <hi>Maryland,</hi> to conquer the <hi>Conoſtogas</hi>; and that the Second Time we was at War with them, we carried them all off.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>BROTHER Aſſaraquoa,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You charge us with not acting agreeable to our Peace with the <hi>Catawbas</hi>; we will repeat truly to you what was done. The Governor of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>York,</hi> at <hi>Albany,</hi> in Behalf of <hi>Aſſaraquoa,</hi> gave us ſeveral Belts from the <hi>Cherrokees</hi> and <hi>Cataw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi>; and we agreed to a Peace, it thoſe Nations would ſend ſome of the great Men to us, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it Face to Face; and that they wou'd trade with us; and deſired, that they would appoint a Time to meet at <hi>Albany,</hi> for this Purpoſe: But they never came.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>BROTHER Aſſaraquoa,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We then deſired a Letter might be ſent to the <hi>Catawbas</hi> and <hi>Cherrokees,</hi> to deſire them to come and confirm the Peace: It was long before an Anſwer came; but we met the <hi>Cherrokees</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd the Peace, and ſent ſome of our People to take Care of them, until they returned to their own Country.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Catawbas</hi> refus'd to come, and ſent us Word that we were but Women; that they were Men, and double Men, for they had Two
<note n="*" place="bottom">This is a Figure by which the <hi>Indians</hi> expreſs Strength and Power. So when the Governor of <hi>Canada</hi> deſigns to explain to the <hi>Indians</hi> the Power and Strength of the grand Monarch, he tells them his <hi>P—k</hi> is as large as he can ſpan with both his Hands.</note>

<pb n="44" facs="unknown:005417_0056_10182CD445FCA760"/>
that they could make Women of us, and wou'd be always at War with us. They are a deceitful People; our Brother <hi>Aſſaraquoa</hi> is deceived by them; we don't blame him for it, but are ſorry he is deceived.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>BROTHER Aſſaraquoa,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have confirm'd the Peace with the <hi>Cherro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kees,</hi> but not with the <hi>Catawbas</hi>; they have been treacherous, and know it, ſo that the War muſt continue till one of us is deſtroyed: This we think proper to tell you, that you may not be troubled at what we do to the <hi>Catawbas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>BROTHER Aſſaraquoa,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We will now ſpeak to the Point between us: You ſay you will agree with us as to the Road; we deſire that may be the Road which was laſt made the Waggon Road. It is always a Cuſtom, among Brethren or Strangers, to uſe each other kindly: You have ſome very ill-natur'd People living up there; ſo that we deſire the Perſons in Power may know, that we are to have reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Victuals when we are in Want.</p>
                  <p>You know very well when the white People came firſt here, they were poor; but now they have got our Lands, they are become rich, and we are now poor: What little we have had for the Land goes ſoon away, but the Land laſts for ever. You told us you had brought with you a Cheſt of Goods, and that you have the Key in your Pockets; but we have never ſeen the Cheſt, nor the Goods that are ſaid to be in it; it may be ſmall, and the Goods few; we want to ſee them, and are as deſirous to come to ſome Concluſion as 
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:005417_0057_10182CD6E83B0AB0"/>
you are: We have been ſleeping here theſe Ten Days paſt, and have not done any Thing to the Purpoſe.</p>

                  <p>We underſtood by them, that the principal Actor in theſe Murders, is in your Priſon, and that he had done all the Miſchief himſelf; but beſides him, you had accus'd and demanded two others, who were in his Company, when the Murder was committed.</p>
                  <p>We promiſe faithfully, in our Return, to renew our Reproofs, and to charge the <hi>Delaware</hi>'s to ſend down ſome of their Chiefs, with theſe two young Men, but not as Priſoners, to be examined by you; and as we think, upon Examination, you will not find them guilty, we rely on your Juſtice, not to do them any Harm, but to permit them to return home in Safety: We likewiſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,

               <p>The Governor having confer'd with the Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Commiſſioners of <hi>Virginia</hi> and <hi>Maryland,</hi> made the following Reply:</p>

                     <hi>BRETHREN,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am glad to find, that you agree with me, in the Neceſſity of keeping the Road between us, clear and open; and the Concern you have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd, on account of the barbarous Murders
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:005417_0064_10182CEE8D33A768"/>
mentioned to you, is a Proof of your brotherly Affection for us.</p>
                  <p>In Crimes of this Nature, be not ſtrictly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd into, and the Criminals ſeverely puniſhed, there will be an Fnd of all Commerce, between us and the <hi>Indians</hi>; and then you will be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the Power of the <hi>French</hi>; they will ſet what Price they pleaſe on their Goods, and give you what they think fit for your Skins: So it is for your own Intereſt, that our Traders ſhould be ſafe in their Perſons and Goods, when they travel to your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>BRETHREN,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I conſidered this Matter well, before I came from <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> and I adviſed with the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil there upon it, as I have done here, with the Honourable the Commiſſioners of <hi>Virginia</hi> and <hi>Maryland</hi>; I never heard before, of the Murder of three <hi>Indians</hi> at <hi>Hohio:</hi> Had Complaint been made to me of it, and it had appear'd, to have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </p>
                  <p>You are not to take your own Satisfaction, but to apply to me, and I will ſee that Juſtice be done you; and ſhou'd any of the <hi>Indians</hi> rob, or murder, any of our People; I do expect, that you will deliver them up, to be tried and puniſhed in the ſame Manner, as white People are: This is the Way to preſerve Friendſhip between us, and will be for your Benefit, as well as ours.</p>
                  <p>I am well pleaſed with the Steps you have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready taken, and the Reproofs you have given, to 
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:005417_0065_10182CF325F61420"/>
your Couſins the <hi>Delawares</hi>; and I do expect, you will lay your Commands on ſome of their Chiefs, to bring down the two young Men that were preſent at the Murders: If they are not brought down, I ſhall look upon it as a Proof of their Guilt. If, upon Examination, they ſhall be found not to have been concerned in the bloody Action, they ſhall be well uſed and ſent home in Safety: I will take it upon myſelf, to ſee that they have no Injuſtice done them.</p>
                  <p>An Inventory is taken of the Goods already reſtor'd, and I expect Satisfaction will be made for ſuch as cannot be found, in Skins, according to their Promiſe</p>
                  <p>I well remember the coming down of one of the <hi>Canoy</hi> Indians, with a Paper, ſetting forth, that the <hi>Canoys</hi> had come to a Reſolution, to leave the Land reſerved for them by the Proprietors; but he made no Complaint to me of ill Uſage from the white People: The Reaſon he gave for their Removal was, that the Settling of the white People all round them, had made Deer ſcarce; and that therefore, they choſe to remove to <hi>Joni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atta,</hi> for the Benefit of Hunting. I ordered what they ſaid to be entered into the Council-Book: The old Man's Expences were born, and a Blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket given him at his Return home.</p>
                  <p>I have not heard from the Proprietors yet on this Head; but you may be affur'd, from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Juſtice they have always ſhewn to the <hi>Indians,</hi> that they will do every Thing that can be reaſonably expected of them, in this Caſe.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> being told by the Interpreter, that their Brother <hi>Aſſaraquoa</hi> was going to ſpeak to them, ſpoke as follows:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>SACHEMS and Warriours, our Friends and Brethren,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As we have already ſaid enough to you, on the Subject of the Title to the Lands you claim from <hi>Virginia</hi>; we have no Occaſion to ſay any Thing more to you on that Head, but come directly to the Point.</p>
                  <p>We have opened the Cheſt, and the Goods are now here before you: They coſt Two Hundred Pounds <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> Money, and were bought by a Perſon recommended to us by the Governor of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> with ready Caſh: We ordered them to be good in their Kinds, and we believe they are ſo. Theſe Goods, and Two Hundred Pounds in Gold, which lie now on the Table, we will give you, our Brethren of the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> upon Condition, that you immediately make a Deed, 
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:005417_0067_10182CF80A2CC068"/>
recognizing the King's Right to all the Lands that are, or ſhall be, by His Majeſty's Appointment, in the Colony of <hi>Virginia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to the Road, we agree you ſhall have one; and the Regulations are in a Paper, which the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter now has in his Cuſtody to ſhew you: The People of <hi>Virginia</hi> ſhall perform their Part, if you and your <hi>Indians</hi> perform theirs: We are your Brethren, and will do no Hardſhips to you, but, on the contrary, all the Kindneſs we can.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> agreed to what was ſaid; and <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſateego</hi> deſired that they would repreſent their Caſe to the King, in order to have a further Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when the Settlements increaſed much further back: To which the Commiſſioners agreed, and promiſed they would make ſuch a Repreſentation faithfully and honeſtly; and for their further Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity that they would do ſo, they would give them a Writing, under their Hands and Seals, for that Purpoſe.</p>
               <p>They deſir'd that ſome Rum might be given them, to drink on their Way home; which the Commiſſioners agreed to, and paid them in Gold for that Purpoſe, and the Carriage of their Goods from <hi>Philadelphia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Canaſateego</hi> further ſaid, That as their Brother <hi>Tocarry-hogan,</hi> ſent them Proviſions on the Road here, which kept them from ſtarving; he hop'd their Brother <hi>Aſſaraquoa</hi> would do the ſame for them back, and have the Goods he gave them, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the uſual Place: Which the Commiſſioners agreed to, and ordered Proviſions and Carriages to I provided accordingly.</p>

                  <pb n="46" facs="unknown:005417_0068_10182CFBA6210C20"/>
After this Conference, the Deed was produc'd, and the Interpreter explain'd to them, and, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Rank and Quality, they put their Marks and Seals to it, in the Preſence of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of <hi>Maryland,</hi> and of ſeveral Gentlemen of <hi>Virginia, Maryland,</hi> and <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> as Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and when they delivered the Deed, <hi>Canaſateego</hi> delivered it to the Commiſſioners of <hi>Virginia,</hi> for the Uſe of their Father the great King, and hoped he would conſider them: On which, the Gentlemen and <hi>Indians</hi> preſent, gave three Shouts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Canaſateego, Tachanoontia, Shickcalamy,</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others, ſaid, they hoped ſomething wou'd be given them to drink, for they were very dry.</p>
               <p>The Commiſſioners ordered a ſufficient Quantity of Wine and Water to be mixed, and drank Health to the great King and the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> their Brethren, and departed with the reſt of the Gentlemen from the Chamber.</p>

for you, and you to hear with your Ears for us, we take this Opportunity to inform you of what very nearly concerns us both.</p>
                  <p>The Great King of <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> King, have declared War againſt each other: Two Battles have been ſought, one by Land and the other by Sea; the Great King of <hi>England</hi> commanded the Land Army in Perſon, and gain'd a compleat Victory; Numbers of the <hi>French</hi> were kill'd and taken Priſoners, and the reſt were ſorc'd to paſs a River with Precipitation, to ſave their Lives: The Great God covered the King's Head in that Battle, ſo that he did not receive the leaſt Hurt; for which you, as well as we, have Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be very thankful.</p>
                  <p>The Engagement at Sea was likewiſe to the Advantage of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>: The <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> join'd their Ships together, and came out to ſight us: The brave <hi>Engliſh</hi> Admiral burnt one of their largeſt Ships, and many others were ſo ſhatter'd, that they were glad to take the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of a very high Wind and a dark Night to run away, and to hide themſelves again in their Harbours. Had the Weather prov'd ſair, he wou'd, in all Probability, have taken or deſtroy'd them all.</p>
                  <p>I need not put you in Mind how much <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Penn,</hi> and his Sons, have been your Friends, and the Friends of all the <hi>Indians</hi>; you have long and often experienc'd their Friendſhip for you: Nor need I repeat to you how kindly you were treated, and what valuable Preſents were made to you, Two Years ago, by the Governor, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and the Aſſembly of <hi>Pennſylvania.</hi> The Sons of <hi>William Penn</hi> are all now in <hi>England,</hi> and have

left me in their Place, well knowing how much I regard you, and all the <hi>Indians:</hi> As a freſh Proof of this, I have left my Houſe and am come this far to ſee you, to renew our Treaties, to brighten the covenant Chain, and to confirm our Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with you. In Teſtimony whereof, I preſent you with this Belt of <hi>Wampum.</hi>

A War is now declar'd, and we expect you will not ſuffer the <hi>French,</hi> or any of the <hi>Indians</hi> in Alliance with them, to march through your Country to diſturb any of our Settlements; and that you will give us the earlieſt and beſt Intelligence of any Deſigns that may be formed by them to our Diſadvantage, as we promiſe to do of any that may be to yours.

                  <p>Our Friend <hi>Conrad Weiſer,</hi> when he is old, will go into the other World, as our Fathers have done; our Children will then want ſuch a Friend, to go between them and your Children, to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile any Differences, that may happen to ariſe between them, that like him, may have the Ears and Tongues, of our Children and yours.</p>

The way to have ſuch a Friend is, for you to ſend three or four of your Boys to <hi>Virginia,</hi> where we have a fine Houſe for them to live in, and a Man on purpoſe, to teach the Children of you, our Friends, the Religion, Language, and Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of the white People.</p>
                  <p>To this Place we kindly invite you to ſend ſome of your Children; and promiſe you, that they ſhall have the ſame Care taken of them, and be inſtructed in the ſame Manner, as our own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and be return'd to you again when you pleaſe: And to confirm this, we give you this String of <hi>Wampum.</hi>

                  <p>As the Treaty now made, concerning the Lands in <hi>Maryland,</hi> will, we hope, prevent effectually, every future Miſunderſtanding between us, on that Account; we will now bind faſter the Links of our Chain of Friendſhip, by a Renewal of all our former Treaties: And that they may ſtill be the better ſecur'd, we ſhall preſent you with One Hundred Pounds in Gold.</p>
                  <p>What we have further to ſay to you is, let not our Chain contract any Ruſt; when ever you perceive the leaſt Speck, tell us of it, and we will make it clean; This we alſo expect from you, that it may

                  <p>We return you Thanks for your ſeveral Speeches, which are very agreeable to us; they contain Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſuch great Moment, that we propoſe to give them a very ſerious Conſideration, and to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer them ſuitably to their Worth and Excellence: And this will take till To-morrow Morning, and when we are ready, we ſhall give you due Notice.</p>
                  <p>You tell us you have beat the <hi>French</hi>; if ſo, you muſt have taken a great deal of Rum from them, and can the better ſpare us ſome of that hot Liquor, to make us rejoice with you in the Victory.</p>

                  <p>As to your Preſents, we never eſtimate theſe Things by their real Worth, but by the Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Giver: In this Light we accept them with great Pleaſure, and put a high Value on them.
