            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THE Life of man in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent world is celebrated by many Maſters of Morality among the Heathen, under the notion of a <hi>Warfare:</hi> but <hi>theſe</hi> were never able by their moſt exalted Theories to ſtate the true nature, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the juſt rules for the ſucceſſful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge hereof: For after all their Eſſayes, the undiſciplined Combatant will need dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and the ſaint hearted, encouragement in the day of Battel. But now Chriſtianity
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001016_0003_0FAEEDAC1C6D82F8"/>
does ſupply all theſe defects: This gives us a more exalted notion of this <hi>Warfare;</hi> and lays down the beſt rules for the conduct of the Chriſtian Souldier from his firſt Entring the <hi>Line of Battel,</hi> till death ſhall raiſe the <hi>Camp,</hi> and give him a <hi>diſcharge.</hi> Here the Conduct and Proweſs of the General, under whoſe Banner he is to fight, is diſplayed; the power and policy of thoſe Enemies, which he is to agonize and conflict with, is laid open; the good cauſe, in which he is to Engage, diſcovered; and the glorious prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium, or prize, which he is to contend for, is ſet forth, and aſſured to the Victor; a Prize ſufficient to inſpire every breaſt that has the beſt ſenſe of true honour, with all the Eſſentials of an heroical reſolution, and unbroken courage.</p>
            <p>How a Soul ſhall diſcharge this Warfare, as becomes the honour of Chriſt his Leader, the goodneſs of the Cauſe, and the glory of the reward is a Quaery of no common im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance: The reſolution of which in ſhort is, that the faithful diſcharge hereof conſiſts in a punctual obſervation of his <hi>Commanders Orders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Orders are plainly and fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Oracles of Truth, which if obſerved, the Combat will be crown<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed with Victory, and the Victory end in an
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001016_0004_0FAEEDAD81EAA190"/>
everlaſting Triumph: Now theſe Orders are exceeding large; as extenſive as the Law of God, which the Royal Prophet tells us, is exceeding broad: The latitude of which Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders conſiſts in their being adapted to all the Children of men under their various circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and Employments. There is no poſt, ſtation or profeſſion but what they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to, and afford conduct in: They reach the King on the Throne, and ſtoop to the Beggar on the Dunghill: They are directive, and obligatory to the Prieſt at the Altar, to the Judge on the Tribunal, and the Souldier in the Camp, and in all his preparations here for: So that by a faithful diſcharge of the duties of their reſpective poſts on Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Principles they will make glorious ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances to the unſhaken Kingdom of Eternal Light and Love.</p>
            <p>Agreeable to all this, Chriſt, the Believers Commander, having withdrawn himſelf as to bodily preſence from his <hi>Militant Camp</hi> on Earth, and being advanced to the head of his <hi>Triumphant Armies</hi> in Heaven; has in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable wiſdom Subſtituted an Order of men, to repreſent his Perſon, act in his name as Under Officers; and theſe ſtand obliged by the duties of their function to publiſh, explain and apply his Orders in their full extent and latitude. Hence it is the charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001016_0005_0FAEEDAD99673450"/>
of one <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>faithful</hi> in this ſacred Order, to bring out or his Storehouſe things new and old, and to give every one their portion in due ſeaſon; and neither hopes nor fears are to move them from this duty of their charge. A Goſpel Miniſter in the diſcharge of his Office, is not only to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the general duties of Chriſtianity, which reſpect all in common, that are Liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under Chriſt Jeſus; but as opportunity calls, to make a more cloſe application of particular duties to men in their reſpective capacities; and to warn them againſt thoſe temptations which endanger their welfare in their ſeveral Stations. When Chriſt's Ambaſſadors do thus, they are not to be trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as deſerters of their proper charge; nor voted guilty of an uſurpation, or an Invaſion made on anothers Province: But it is to be accounted a ſpecimen of that wiſdom and fidelity, which become the character of <hi>Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards in Chriſts Houſhold.</hi> A glorious inſtance of this prudence and faithfulneſs we have before us in <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> in his treatment of perſons of divers Orders, agreeable to their ſeveral characters.</p>

of God in humane nature; under which Veil he was to ſcreen the inſufferable brightneſs of his Divinity in order to the Redemption of his Choſen <hi>Iſrael</hi> according to the Everlaſting Counſel or peace: how God was pleaſed to diſpatch <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> the promiſed <hi>Elias,</hi> as an Herald of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Meſſias, as the Morning Star to uſher in the Sun of Righteouſneſs: This fore runner of Chriſt was authorized by his Doctrine and Baptiſm to prepare ſinners of that day for the reception of this Prince of Peace. In order to this we find him Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Doctrine, and Adminiſtring the Baptiſm of Repentance: which he Enforces with the conſideration <hi>that the Kingdom of God was at hand;</hi> and withal alarms his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory with an awful prediction of Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, if they refuſe to comply with his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: The ſucceſs of which Diſpenſation we have an account of. Many of his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors were awakened, brought to ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious thought; ſo as to addreſs him for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther direction. Thus we find many of the people, the Publicans, &amp; the Souldiers ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Baptiſt for further Inſtruction.</p>
            <p>Our Text is the addreſs made by men of Military Order. <hi>The Souldiers likewiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him, ſaying, and what ſhall we do?</hi> In which we may obſerve,</p>

The Prieſt's lips muſt preſerve knowledge; and we are to aſk the Law at his mouth.</p>

inſtruct us, O thou Man of God, how we may order our lives; and particularly in that Poſt that Divine Providence has placed us in, that we may eſcape the Wrath to come, and be prepared for the Kingdom of God.</p>
            <p>From the words there are two Aſſertions which ſhall employ our preſent meditations.</p>
            <div n="1" type="assertion">
               <head>Aſſertion I. That Military Men, or Souldiers, are an Order of men allowable and proper in a Chriſtian State.</head>
               <p>This is a truth that every one, who is not blinded by prejudice, muſt aſſent to as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conteſtable: Who can diſpute the lawfulneſs of this Order, that do but take a view of thoſe principles, which the God of Nature has originally implanted in humanity; who do conſider the Hiſtory and Doctrine both of the Veiled and Unveiled Goſpel; and withal obſerve the Diſpenſations of Divine Providence in the world? Yet this has been confronted by the ſtrongeſt efforts of Wit, and Art: Thus it has been aſſaulted by <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus,</hi> and the main body of the <hi>Racovian</hi> Rout, together with many giddy Enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſts, who liſted under their Banner to defy and fight againſt the Truths of the <hi>Living God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="unknown:001016_0009_0FAEEDB31557C2A8"/>
It muſt indeed be acknowledged that War to which Military men bear a relation, is an evil to be deprecated: The tragical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of all Ages do ſpeak in bloody chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters what fearful deſolation it makes: and this is given by ſome as a reaſon why in the Sacred Records the ſame word is ſometimes uſed to ſignifie War, and Harveſt: becauſe in War men are reapt and mown down by the Sword; as Graſs and Corn by the Scyth and Sickle. <hi>Every Battel,</hi> faith the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Prophet, <hi>is with confuſed noiſe, and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments rolled in blood. Iſa. 9.5.</hi> But yet this does not argue that War is Subverſive of Chriſtianity; or that this Order of men, who are to tranſact in this affair is not to be allowed in Goſpel Dayes: for Souldiers are not only allowable, but proper and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in a Chriſtian State. To ſtate and illuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate this Aſſertion, let us remark.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That there would have been no occaſion for men of Military Order, had man retained his primitive integrity.</hi> This was not from the beginning. The Original State or Nature is not a ſtate of War. Had the Divine I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage on man, which conſiſted in the inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ective rectitude of all his powers, remained in its created brightneſs; had not the glory of humane nature been ſullyed by ſin; there would have been no foundation for men of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001016_0010_0FAEEDB399426670"/>
a Military quality. There would have been no Armies to confront or guard againſt; no Paſſes to be forced; no Seiges to be raiſed; no Garriſons to be Storm'd Unblemiſhed Innocency would have preſerved mankind in perfect Amity. This Order therefore is conſequent upon the Apoſtaſy: Had not man deſerted that Paſt God at firſt placed him in, turned <hi>Revolter;</hi> and put himſelf under a <hi>forreign juriſdiction;</hi> and jovn'd with the Rebel Hoſt of Apoſtate Spirits in the curſed conſpiracy againſt God; there would have been no <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, nor diſcord among men. Had not Sin drawn the <hi>flaming Sword</hi> of Divine Juſtice, men would never have drawn the Sword againſt one another: The whole Earth would have been a <hi>Sanctuary of Peace,</hi> whereas Sin has now made it an <hi>Aceldama,</hi> a field of blood, a Stage on which the moſt <hi>bloody Tragedies</hi> have been acted.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Were the principles of Chriſtianity fully en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tertained and acted upon in the world, there would be no need of Military men.</hi> Peace among men is one bleſſing which the Goſpel of peace naturally tends to introduce.

               <p n="3">3. This <hi>notwithſtanding the Publick weal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires ſuch an order of men in a Chriſtian ſtate; &amp; conſequently they are by the rules of Chriſtianity allowable and proper.</hi> The Goſpel has not obtained ſuch full entertainment in the world,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001016_0012_0FAEEDB516CF9598"/>
as to make <hi>Wars to ceaſe on the Earth.</hi> A Chriſtian ſtate is expoſed to the inſults and outrages of the ſons of Violence: and this violence is to be repelled by men expert in martial accompliſhments. It is high handed preſumption for a Chriſtian people to depend on God, by the miraculous interpoſition of his Providence, to ſhield them from ruin, while they neglect the proper means for their own ſecurity: For though God can, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times do's ſave, without, nay contrary to means, yet his ordinary and ſtated way is to appear by his bleſſing on means for the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his Iſrael. Hence according to the ordinary Series of Providence, it is many times impoſſible for a People to maintain Peace at home, ſecure their Civil and Sacred Liberties from the invaſion &amp; incroachments of unreaſonable men, unleſs the Sword be drawn. The publick tranquillity ſometimes makes a War eligible: It is indeed a devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>but out of that eater meat will come forth.</hi> 
                  <q>At certain Times the Publick Calamities (as one ſayeſ) are of that nature, that <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations of Steel</hi> are found to be the moſt ſucceſful Antidotes:</q> and there is no poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of curing theſe maladies but by theſe <hi>Chaly beates:</hi> Now Military men are neceſſary to apply this remedy to a ſick &amp; languiſhing State: Hence by the Law of ſelf preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001016_0013_0FAEEDB5E9F783D8"/>
on, that fundamental Law of humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſuch an Order of men are to be upheld in a Chriſtian Common Wealth: And if natural principles oblige hereto, Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will not prohibit it: Chriſtianity does not ſubvert any of Natures Laws; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm and exalt them. Souldiers therefore being a proper medium to a laudable End, <abbr>

                  </abbr> the publick good, it muſt be allowed the approbation of the true Religion, and of a duly regulated Conſcience: There is no prohibition in Scripture againſt a Military Profeſſion: were there; Why did not the Baptiſt diſband the Souldiers in our Text? Why did not our Lord and Maſter deplume the Centurion that came to him? Why did he not command him to lay down his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,</hi> as inconſiſtent with that <hi>faith,</hi> which in <hi>Iſrael</hi> it ſelf, had not its <hi>parallel?</hi> In a word, Why in Scripture are Monuments E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected in honour of ſuch as have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for their Martial Atchievements; their names mentioned with the character of honour; by which they are conſecrated to Poſterity?

               <head>Aſſertion II. That there are Duties incumbent on Souldiers, which Chriſtianity obliges and encourages them to the diſcharge of.</head>
               <p>Deſigned brevity will permit me only to give a reſolution to this Enquiry, <abbr>
                     <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </abbr>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What are thoſe duties which Chriſtianity does oblige &amp; encourage Souldiers to the diſcharge of?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here, I ſhall not inſiſt on thoſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which are not only incumbent on Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, but alſo on all in common, who are Entred into Chriſt's Muſter roll.</p>
               <p>There is but one way that leads to the City of the Living God; and in that way both the Prince and Peaſant, bond and free, both Gown, and Sword men, muſt <hi>Storm the Kingdom of Heaven, and take it by violence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that my diſcourſe may in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ly level to the occaſion of the preſent day, I ſhall only conſider the duties that our Religion obliges Souldiers unto, as <hi>ſuch;</hi> which have an immediate aſpect upon them in their Military Capacities. And that my thoughts here may be diſtinct, it ſeems not improper to diſtinguiſh between Souldiers only in preparation by their Military Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes for real Service; and ſuch as are actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called to real Service, to jeopardiſe their lives in the high places of the field. It ſeems
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001016_0015_0FAEEDBBDE3907B0"/>
to be no great decorum in treating Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers at home, in peace, with the ſame addreſs as is ſuited to thoſe that are ingaged in War, actually confronting an inſolent Adverſary. Here then we may eſſay a ſhort account of the duties, which by the Laws of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, are incumbent on each. And.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>As to the duties which Chriſtianity obliges Souldiers to diſcharge, who are only by their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Exerciſes at home in preparation for War.</hi> And the duties of theſe may be ranckt under five general heads: As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Chriſtianity obliges Souldiers to engage in theſe preparative Military Exerciſes for a right end,</hi> ſuch as God <hi>may approve of.</hi> It is the <hi>Prerogative</hi> of man, by which he is raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the level of the inferiour Creation, to act upon deliberation, and free Election, <hi>as a cauſe by Counſel</hi> of his own actions: hence he muſt act for ſome End; which he is to have in his eye, and make the meaſure of his actions; which End ought to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worthy and proportionable to thoſe intellective and elective powers, with which humane nature is Ennobled. And this is one principal hinge on which the moral good, or evil of his actions does turn. For though the <hi>Intention</hi> of a good End be not of it ſelf ſufficient to legitimate, or conſecrate an act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, <hi>as ſome have vainly aſſerted;</hi> yet the want
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001016_0016_0FAEEDBC9A7FD040"/>
of it will deſecrate and prophane the beſt.</p>
               <p>Such therefore, as would engage in any af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, ſo as to obſerve therein the dictates of the Chriſtian Religion, muſt look well to their end; that it be ſuch, as may be approved of at the Tribunal of God, &amp; the bar of unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced reaſon; to both of which man ſtands accountable. Here then, by the rules of Chriſtianity, the Souldier in theſe his prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Exerciſes ſtands obliged to have a good end in his intention. And this ought to be the ſame end with that, for which the <hi>Art Military</hi> was firſt contrived &amp; inſtituted. In this affair that maxim of the Schools is not to take place, <hi>Non Idem finis Artis et Artificis:</hi> the end of the Art and Artiſt is not here to be diſtinguiſht: Now this end is as ultimately the honour of God, in the good and ſafety of the Common weal, ſo nextly to be prepared for real Service, when the publick ſafety calls for it. Military Exerciſe is not to be lookt on as a play fit for Children, but as a work &amp; buſineſs for men: Men are to engage in theſe Exerciſes not meerly for diverſion, but with an actual deſign to get themſelves ready to ſtand <hi>in the high places of the field, to ſpeak with the Enemy in the gate,</hi> when Providence ſhall call them forth. This end, it is be feared, is far from the thought of the moſt, that put themſelves under diſcipline: The moſt never
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001016_0017_0FAEEDBD64AF5798"/>
dream of real Service; they think of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent diverſion, to make a goodly appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, to look big and ſtrutt in Armour; and no wonder if ſuch be creſt fallen when an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy invades the Land, &amp; danger approaches. By the want of this end the Chriſtian Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er violates his Chriſtian obligation: without this deſign of real Service theſe Exerciſes, with what pomp ſo ever managed, are but a vain ſhew; which according to the rules of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion will deface the Character of a Martial Spirit. The Souldier, that has not this prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for real Service in his Eye, can give no tolerable account why he appears in Arms; unleſs to fill up an empty ſpace with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as empty and void: ſuch are no better than Cyphers placed at the left hand of an Accompt, which no whit advances the Sum; they add not to the number of the choſen men of Iſrael, <hi>men prepared for war.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Chriſtianity requires a due caution againſt all thoſe things that are ſubverſive of this end.</hi> That which obliges us to intend and will the end, obliges us to nill and refuſe every thing that tends to fruſtrate that end: If therefore the Souldier, while at home &amp; in peace, is bound in his Military Exerciſes to aim at a prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for real Service; it then naturally fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that he is under the ſame engagement to take heed, that he avoid all that will impede
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001016_0018_0FAEEDBE5570D4A0"/>
this his preparation, or render him unfit for Service: left when Providence ſhall open the Campaign, and poſt him in the line of battel he be found faint hearted and dare not; or, undiſciplined, and ſo knows not how to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his Poſt when vigorouſly aſſaulted. And there are many things, which the Souldier is obliged by Chriſtianity to take heed againſt, as that which will ſubvert his end in theſe preparatory Exerciſes: we may hint at ſome of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tbus the Souldier is obliged to take heed againſt luxury and debauchery.</hi> For theſe will emaſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and effeminate his Spirits, and ſo unfit him to enter the liſt againſt an hardy foe. <hi>He that ſtriveth for maſtery,</hi> faith the Apoſtle, <hi>is temperate in all things, 1 Cor. 9. 25.</hi> Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance enfeebles the body, and renders it unfit for heroick actions; it ſoftens the mind, and ſo indiſpoſes the man for any noble &amp; great reſolves; but prepares him to be an eaſy prey to an inſulting Enemy. This proved fatal to <hi>Benhadad</hi> &amp; his confederate Princes, <hi>I King.</hi> 20 16.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Sloth and Idleneſs the Souldier at home is obliged to watch againſt.</hi> A Military life is a life of action; and whatever unfits for action unfits for that Service. Now ſloth by a Phyſical efficiency abates the vigour, and damps the noble purpoſes of the Soul; it ruſts
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001016_0019_0FAEEDBED4245B58"/>
the Spirits, and cauſes the faculties of ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to contract an unaccountable hebitude and dulneſs. Idleneſs is a ſort of Lethargy that benums the active powers of the Soul, &amp; lays them aſleep. It renders the Souldier a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe to undertake and incapable to undergo the fatigues of a Martial Expedition. The ſlothful is never like to blazon his own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, defend his Country, or advance its renown by his Exploits in the field of War. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> therefore is to be condemned as deſtructive of the true end of Souldiery, and as ſuch, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by the rules of Chriſtianity, <hi>What e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thine hands find to do, do with all thy might: Be not <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> in buſineſs, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe are docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>The Souldier muſt avoid every thing that tends to nouriſh Security</hi> Security will keep him from due preparations; and expoſe to inevitable ruine, when danger approaches. This was that which laid <hi>Laiſh</hi> deſolate <hi>Judg.</hi> 18. 27 She was <hi>quiet</hi> and <hi>ſecure,</hi> and ſo ſoon ſurprized into ruin; the inhabitants cut off by the <hi>Edge of the Sword,</hi> and the City <hi>burnt with fire</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Chriſtianity obliges them to take heed that they do not over rate, and value the preſent life.</hi> An over value for life will unfit a Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for that Service, in which he muſt carry his life in his hand: it will indiſpoſe him to
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:001016_0020_0FAEEDBFF9A14008"/>
Sacrifice it in the field of honour, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the publick tranquillity. The eſtimate, which <hi>Pomp<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y</hi> made of life, was highly becoming the Character of a Chriſtian Souldier, when with great violence <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> by many from Embarquing in a violent ſtorm, replyed with in heroick bravery, <hi>My Voyage is neceſſary, my Life is not ſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Finally, <hi>Chriſtians obliges that they take heed of an ungovernable Spirit.</hi> Such a Spirit in Souldiers threatens all with confuſion: it is the ſpring from whence all mutinies, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrections proceed: when this ſpirit troubles the Camp, nothing but deſolation is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected: it is the worſt of plagues, that can invade an Army; it is infectious, &amp; threatens the whole; it ſpread, like a gangreen; and is ordinarily cured by no <hi>lennives,</hi> but only by the ſharpeſt <hi>corroſives</hi> of Martial diſcipline. Chriſtianity therefore requires Souldiers while at home in peace in theſe Exerciſes, to take heed againſt this ungovernable ſpirit, as that which is obſtructive to the true end of Soulde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: And the <hi>prevailing of this Spirit is judged by perſons of thought &amp; obſervation to be not the leaſt ill Omen that attends the Military affairs of this Land.</hi> Now againſt all theſe things, which are impedimental to the end of Military or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, our Religion enters a caution.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>It obliges to diligence in the purſuit of this
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:001016_0021_0FAEEDC4947F8730"/>
End by the moſt proper and accommodable means.</hi> He that is obliged to will the End, is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to chuſe, and diligently to purſue the means that lead to that End. Hence Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers being obliged in their preſent Exerciſes to make preparation for real Service, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the publick repoſe; they ſtand obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the ſame rule, to uſe the moſt proper means to get ready. To this end Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity requires, that the Souldier get furniſht with <hi>proper Armour,</hi> or <hi>Martial Weapons:</hi> Without theſe he can't be prepared for Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; neither to defend himſelf, nor to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his Adverſary. And it is no ſeaſon to ſeek for Arms, when called into the Field. It is no wonder the uncircumciſed <hi>Philiſtines</hi> did obtain an eaſy Triumph over <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when there was <hi>not a Shield or a Spear found among fourty thouſand of Iſrael, Judg</hi> 5. 8. As the Spiritual Souldier is not prepared to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his poſt againſt the Militia of Hell, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs arrayed with the whole Armour of God; ſo the proper Souldier will not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to prevent, or repel the violence of his adverſaries, unleſs provided with Arms. Religion and reaſon demand this proviſion <hi>And ſuch trifle with duty, who neglect it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, it obliges Souldiers to a due care that they may attain <hi>Military Science.</hi> Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons are to no purpoſe without ſkill to uſe
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:001016_0022_0FAEEDC57A634400"/>
them. He that in theſe preparatory Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes does not attain expertneſs therein, when called to Engage, will find his Armour al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as uneaſy and uſeleſs, as the Stripling <hi>David</hi> did <hi>Sauls;</hi> and for the ſame reaſon becauſe he <hi>had not proved it.</hi> Skill in the Art Military is a neceſſary medium to that End which Chriſtianity propounds to the Souldier. And the moſt polite Nations have moſt endeavoured after proficiency here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. It is the opinion of ſome verſt in anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, that the Jews had their School for the Souldier, as well as the Prophet; by which they maintained their Glory. Sure we may be it was the wiſdom of the Patriarch <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> to diſcipline his Houſhold. <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. 14. It was <hi>Davids</hi> prudence, after <hi>Sauls</hi> defeat at <hi>Mount Githoa,</hi> to order the inſtruction of the <hi>men of Judah in the uſe of the bow, 2 Sam.</hi> 1. 18. Dexterity in this Art layes the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for Martial Glory. Without this ſkill an Army for number moſt formidable may be put to the rout by a few well diſciplin'd Troops. We ſhall find abundant witneſs of this, if we conſult the records of Antiquity: This it was that Crown'd <hi>Alexander</hi> with victorious Lawrels, and loaded him with the Spoils of his undiſciplined Enemies: This ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced <hi>Caeſar</hi> to a Triumphal Chariot: By this <hi>Rome</hi> enlarged her Dominions, and her
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:001016_0023_0FAEEDC59D7BE9A0"/>
Inhabitants vanquiſhed in Battel double the number of Enemies, who poſſibly might e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, if not ſurpaſs them in natural ſtrength and courage. The Glory of moſt King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms has ebb'd and flow'd with this ſkill. This therefore is a neceſſary medium to real Service: It is not therefore to be lookt on as a matter of indifference, but of Chriſtian obligation, in the preſent ſtate of the world.</p>
               <p>Another medium which tends to fit the Souldier for Service <hi>is Good Orders.</hi> Religion therefore obliges to due care for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation hereof. Order is the beauty of the Univerſe; the Strength and Glory of all Societies; without which they would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and crumble into nothing: Without Order a <hi>Bethel</hi> will become a <hi>Babel,</hi> an <hi>Army</hi> a confuſed <hi>Rout.</hi> Now this Order among Souldiers conſiſts in every one's keeping to the duties of their reſpective places: When the Officers duly give out their Orders; and thoſe under Command do not conteſt them; but with quick obedience move in the line of duty: It is fatal to a Military Body to have this Order broken: The preſervation of it is one good ſtep to make it unconque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. Agreeably we have this deſcription of an invincible Army. <hi>Joel 2 7. They march every one in his way; and none ſhall break their ranks.</hi> The wiſdom of all Nations has judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:001016_0024_0FAEEDC656DB6120"/>
the greateſt ſeverity of Martial Diſcipline juſtifyable towards ſuch, as break this Order. And the greateſt Generals by the Execution of this Diſcipline, have in all Ages ſignalized their ſteady conduct. Memorable is the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count we have of <hi>Papirius</hi> the Dictator, who was with great difficulty perſwaded to ſpare the life of young <hi>Fabius,</hi> the Maſter of his Horſe, for fighting, though ſucceſſfully, in his abſence, and againſt Order. Famous is the Story of <hi>Titus Manlius,</hi> who condemned his own brave Son to Death; for the like victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious attempt; being repugnant to Order. No Order, without indiſputable Obedience; this therefore, as one ſayes, is the Key ſtone of the Arch, which binds and ſuſtains the whole fabrick.</p>
               <p>Now if Order be thus neceſſary to an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my when called abroad to fight, it follows that the maintainance of it at home is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary preparative to real Service. None can in theſe preparatory Exerciſes wink at a breach of this Order, but they betray that truſt, which God and their Country have repoſed in them. The mildeſt Commander muſt make conſcience while at home, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this Order by a due Execution of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline on ſuch as violate it: Otherwiſe they will train up Souldiers, who, when called forth to Service, will be prepared, not to obey,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:001016_0025_0FAEEDC715C82FE8"/>
but mutiny; not to fight, but run, to the reproach of their Leaders, ſcorn of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, and ruin of the Publick.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>Chriſtianity requires that they get their minds arrayed with thoſe Chriſtian vertues which will qualifie them for the attainment of this End.</hi> The former were external media, theſe internal. Let the Souldiers induſtry be never ſo great, his application never ſo cloſe to the outward means, that tend to fit him for Service; yet there are Chriſtian ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, without which he will remain unready when the Signal is given, to take the Alarm, and arm for Battel.</p>
               <p>Thus the Souldier ſhould labour after <hi>a Publick Spirit.</hi> That Souldier is unqualified for Service, that can't lay claim to this Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Soul. A private Spirit, under the government of narrow and ſtingy prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, is not a Martial Spirit; it is a blemiſh to the <hi>Man of War.</hi> This will quaſh all juſt hopes of Service from ſuch: Such will prefer their own private intereſt before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon tranquillity: A man of a private Spirit, though very ſolicitous about the ſafety of his own Cabbine; yet is little thoughtful for the Welfare of the bottom, in which his all is Embarked. Such a one is not prepared to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture his Life in a generous &amp; hazardous En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize for the common Weal. The Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:001016_0026_0FAEEDC80A343A78"/>
therefore muſt labour after a publick Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; a Spirit to reſent all the calamities, and to be paſſionately concerned for the proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his Country. With this Spirit we find thoſe Worthies indued, <hi>Gid on, Baruch, Sampſon, Jephthab,</hi> and <hi>David;</hi> and with this <hi>Armour</hi> they came prepared to fight the Lords Battels.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Magnanimity, or Greatneſs of Spirit,</hi> is another vertue, which qualifies for Service; &amp; this Chriſtianity commands; and the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in his preſent preparations is to ſeek after. By Magnanimity the Souldier will be quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to engage in any noble and generous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; and will chuſe rather to ſacrifice his own life, than the publick peace, or his own honour. The truly great ſpirited Souldier is prepared to bear up againſt all the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips of the warmeſt Service, with an unbro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and erect mind; when the Cauſe of God and his People ſhall preſs him into their Service. This Spirit reſted upon good <hi>Nehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> when he cried out, as <hi>Neh.</hi> 6. 11. <hi>Shall ſuch a man as I fly?</hi> This Spirit inſpired that noble General, who when deſerted by his Army in heat of battel, thus did reprimand them: <hi>Go, ſays he, tell the Living that I dy FIGHTING; while I go and report to the Dead, that you live FLYING.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Finally, <hi>True Piety </hi> is a neceſſary qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:001016_0027_0FAEEDC88F3D2750"/>
for a Souldier in his preparation for Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. The pious man, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> will be found moſt ready to engage in the moſt bloody Encounters for the publick defence. Piety will ſecure the Souldier the proper protection of Divine Providence; which as an impenetrable helmet will defend him; it inflames the mind with the ſtrongeſt reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. Hence we find it the character of the Righteous. <hi>Prov 28. 1. The righteous are as bold as a lyon.</hi> It was by Faith that thoſe Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies waxed <hi>valiant in battel, ſubdued King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and put to flight armies of Aliens,</hi> in <hi>Heb. 11. 34.</hi> A guilty and defiled Conſcience is a bad preparation for Service. Such while under a ſtupefaction through inconſideration may be fool hardy, but not truly brave and valiant: But once they come to have their eyes opened, and take a view of themſelves with reſpect to the <hi>future ſtate;</hi> they will dread their Enemies Artillery as if charged with <hi>hell and damnation:</hi> God, as well as man will appear marching in the Camp to confront them; and no wonder then if their hearts ſaint, and they turn the back in the day of battel. Theſe vertues are preparative qualifications. If therefore the Souldier would get ready for Service, he muſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to get his mind arrayed with theſe, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity obliges hereto: And the Camp is
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:001016_0028_0FAEEDCC64971890"/>
not the moſt proper School to learn them in.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It requires <hi>a dependance on God for his Bleſſing to make all means ſucceſſful to the deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed end.</hi> The Chriſtian in all his wayes ows a deference to God as the fountain and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all bleſſings. It was the Wiſe mans advice, <hi>Prov. 3. 6. In all thy ways acknowledge him;</hi> and this the Souldier is bound to in theſe his Military Exerciſes; and this is done by a dependance on him for a bleſſing, that ſo he may not in vain attend this buſineſs, but may be prepared to fight the battel of the Lord againſt the mighty. It is Gods <hi>prerogative</hi> thus to prepare the Souldier. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary ſkill, courage, and all other martial ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments, are his gift; hence <hi>David,</hi> that man of War, does aſcribe to God the Glory, <hi>Pſal. 144. 1. He teaches my hands to war, and my fingers to fight.</hi> Without this Divine bleſſing, all means will fall ſhort, &amp; leave the Souldier unready. <hi>They may make bright their Armour, and gather the Shields toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet if God raiſe not up the Spirits of men,</hi> all will be to no purpoſe: The Souldiery will be only fit to adorn and advance their Enemies triumphs. Thus we have conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the duties of Souldiers at home, or in a time of peace, engaged in theſe preparatory Military Exerciſes; which duties not barely <hi>moral prudence,</hi> or <hi>ſtate policy,</hi> but <hi>Chriſtianity</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="unknown:001016_0029_0FAEEDCD4F09F9C0"/>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Chriſtianity obliges them to ſee that their cauſe be juſt.</hi> No War is juſt but what is levied upon juſt reaſons: <hi>The Sword of the Lord, as well as of Gideon,</hi> muſt be the ſignal to battel. What thoſe things are, which are requiſite to legitimate a War, is not my province to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. To be ſure it is juſt, when the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry defence of Religion, the prevention of the ruin of the Civil State, do call for it. I ſhall not eſſay critically to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>, men in private capacities are to enquire into the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of making War: It would require more time to a juſt determination hereof, than is allowed me; not it is a caſe to be determined with great caution and tenderneſs; ſince all the reaſons of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, which will render a war lawful &amp; neceſſary, do not ly level ordinarily to the capacities of private perſons. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever no private perſon can with a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience engage in a War evidently unjuſt, and oppreſſive; To engage in it under ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, is to engage in Rapine &amp; Murder;
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:001016_0030_0FAEEDCDEDCE6CD8"/>
and ſuch combatants, if they fall in the battel, are in danger of the <hi>tragical Exit</hi> of thoſe ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, <hi>Ezek. 32. 27. Who are ſaid to deſcend to bell with their weapons of war.</hi> The light of nature, as well as Chriſtianity, does require that there be a juſt cauſe of engaging in hoſtile attempts. The <hi>Romans</hi> of old ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have a juſt ſenſe hereof; hence they inſtituted <hi>a Colledge of Prieſts,</hi> who were term'd <hi>Feciales,</hi> or <hi>Heralds at Arms;</hi> whoſe buſineſs it was to inquire into the reaſons of War, and only on ſufficient reaſons to proclaim it: and until this was done, their Armies were to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from all acts of hoſtility. The juſtneſs of the cauſe of War is required in the <hi>jus feci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ale,</hi> or law of Arms, which is one branch of the law of Nations; and this the Souldier according to the regulation of Chriſtianity muſt have regard to.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It requires that they have a ſufficient Call to ingage herein.</hi> Without this the juſtneſs of the cauſe will not avail; Some <hi>Caſuiſts</hi> with no ſmall vigour diſpute, whether a Military employment do properly belong to a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <hi>general</hi> or <hi>particular Calling;</hi> whether it be <hi>inſtitutum vitae,</hi> or <hi>munus,</hi> a profeſſion of life or an office ſtrictly ſpeaking; but it ſeems a needleſs combate. All muſt own that it can't be undertaken, as many other civil pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions may, <hi>jure proprio,</hi> by a mans own

original authority; but <hi>jure delegato,</hi> by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity derived from others who have ſufficient authority, the power of life and death in their hands. Now ſince it is ſo, none are to ingage in real Service but ſuch, as have a ſufficient call thereto. The Capital offender deſerves death; yet none but ſuch, as hold the Sword of Juſtice, can warrant his Execution. The reaſon is the ſame in the caſe before us, to kill in War ought to be only an Execution of Juſtice, which men muſt be authorized to: Indeed it is lawful may highly laudable and noble for men voluntarily to offer themſelves to the publick Service; but yet they muſt carry to receive their orders from ſuch, as have authority to grant them: without this they will have no call to engage; unleſs forced to it in their own neceſſary defence.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>It requires that in their Engagements they ſhould quit themſelves like men; and that on the principles of Chriſtianity.</hi> It requires that they engage with that vigour, reſolution, &amp; cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, which becomes the Cauſe of God they are engaged in, and the hopes of a glorious immortality, which Chriſtianity ſets before them. When Gods people of old were called forth to Battel; the Prieſts were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded thus to addreſs them. <hi>Deut. 20. 3. Let not your hearts faint fear not &amp; do not trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, neither be ye terrified becauſe of them.</hi> The
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:001016_0032_0FAEEDCF5616BD48"/>
want of this courageous and manly deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Souldiers will betray the Cauſe of God and their Countrey, in which they are engaged; and bring a laſting reproach and infamy on their own names: The want of this reſolution will procure the Souldier <hi>Captive Chains</hi> inſtead of <hi>Victorious Lawrels:</hi> Inſtead of <hi>Riding,</hi> it will cauſe him to be <hi>Led in Triumph,</hi> dragg'd at the Conquerors Chariot Wheels. The Souldier therefore in Battel muſt ſignalize an undaunted Spirit, as a defendant in bearing up againſt the force of the aſſailant; as an aggreſſor in giving the Enemy ſufficient proof of his ſkill and ſtrength. In all the Souldier muſt quit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf like a man; and this muſt be done on Chriſtian principles; having an eye to the recompence of reward; to the Crown not of fading lawrels, but of immorceſſible Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which before he had ſecured, through the merits of Chriſt a flawleſs title to: and with this proſpect, which only Chriſtianity can give, he may mock at fear, defy danger, and not give ground, when the quiver, the glittering ſpear, and the ſhield rattles againſt him: knowing that whether he ſtand or fall, he ſhall be Crown'd as Victor in the other World.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>It requires that they watch againſt thoſe
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:001016_0033_0FAEEDD027A43D38"/>
Temptations that are more peculiar to their Poſt.</hi> Every Station, that Divine Providence places any of the Children of men in, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet with its peculiar temptations. Hells po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, the Worlds flattery, the Hearts treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, cauſe it to be thus. And the Station of a Souldier in the Camp is no ways exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: while he breathes continually on the borders of the Territories of the King of Terrors; he walks amidſt more dangerous ſnares, laid by the Deſtroyer, to take away the life of his Soul. He is beleagured by more Temptations, ſworn Enemies to his Spiritual tranquillity; than with Enemies to his outward peace: There are ſins, which are peculiarly ready to <hi>trouble the Camp;</hi> and infect the Souldiery. Of this nature are thoſe Evils which the Baptiſt in our Context warns the Souldiers againſt, <abbr>
                     <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </abbr> 
                  <hi>Do violence to no man; accuſe no man faiſly; and be content with your Wages.</hi> Now with reſpect to theſe Temptations, the life of a Souldier ought to be a life of circumſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He ſhould be always upon his guard, left he be ſurprized taken, bound, led in triumph, and made the ſport and paſtime of theſe <hi>Philiſtine Luſts,</hi> that war againſt the Soul.

5. Laſtly, <hi>It requires that they do all, that in them lies to Engage Gods preſence in their Camp.</hi> The beſt diſciplined Army under the conduct of <hi>David'</hi>s Worthies, without this preſence of God, will never render a people ſucceſſful in War: <hi>The Race is not to the ſwift; nor the Battel to the ſtrong. Eccles.</hi> 9. 11. God is the Lord of Hoſts; the God of Battel. His preſence will put life and vigour into the moſt feeble hoſt, and cauſe them to do valiantly: With this preſence the <hi>Thiſtle</hi> may challenge, and look in the face the <hi>Cedar of Lebanon.</hi> When God marcheth in the Camp, an handful of men ſhall vanquiſh puiſſant Armies; one ſhall chaſe a thouſand, and ten put ten thouſand to flight. Whatever ſide God takes ſhall prove victorious. This preſence of God therefore the Souldier is obliged to Engage with him; as that which is neceſſary to his ſucceſs. From a full perſwaſion of this it was, that when-ever the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> went out to Battel, the <hi>Ark,</hi> that <hi>Symbol of Gods Preſence,</hi> and the <hi>promiſed Meſſias,</hi> was carried into the Camp: On the preſence of which they more depended than on their own ſtrength, ſkill or number.

               <p>II. <hi>God and man juſtly expect that you ſhould be prepared.</hi> Man juſtly expects it; becauſe this is the very deſign of your Military Appearances: and if we Enquire into the reaſon of firſt Erecting an Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery; we ſhall find it to be this: <abbr>
                     <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </abbr> That the State might be furniſht with a ſufficient number of perſons Expert in War, <hi>Each of them like the Son of a King,</hi> who might be fit to lead and command, when War invades the Land.</p>

God expects this of you: for it is the duty that does naturally reſult from year Station, and without a deſign and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to anſwer Gods expectation herein, a day devoted to theſe Exerciſes will be no better than a day devoted to play and paſtime; and to ſpeak freely, <hi>there will be found no great decorum in a Prayer or a Sermon as a Prologue to ſuch Ludicious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes.</hi> Labour therefore to get your ſelves in all reſpects prepared for real Service, that you may not fruſtrate the juſt Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations of God and man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To wind up all:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let me not be thought a deſerter, if I add, while you are engaged in theſe Military Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, forget not your Spiritual Warfare: Remember you have Enemies, which muſt not only be conteſted with, but vanquiſht; Enemies whoſe malignity is inveterate, whoſe policy is deep, whoſe diligence is indefatiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſtratagems almoſt unfathomable: Remember your ſafety lies in the Strength, Wiſdom and Conduct of CHRIST your Leader. See that you be faithful in

the diſcharge of this Warfare; and hereby you will be fitter for the Service of a proper Souldier among men. In the Name of the Lord of Hoſts Erect your Banners, and do valiantly. And for your encouragement, know it; that if you be faithful in this work of the Lord, ere long you ſhall be honoured not only with a <hi>Slight Ovation,</hi> but a <hi>proper Triumph.</hi> The City into which you ſhall Enter, a City whoſe foundations are precious Stones, all whoſe Gates are entire Pearls, whoſe Streets are paved with pure Gold, is already prepared. Into this City you ſhall make your Entrance, Riding in a Triumphal Chariot, attended with Glorious Hoſts of bright Intelligences; here ſhall triumphal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches be Erected as Trophies, and Monuments of your Proweſs and conduct; Palms ſhall adorn your hands, Songs of Victory ſhall fill your Mouths, and Coronets of untarniſht Glory ſhall incircle your Victorious brows: The whole Conſiſtory of Heaven ſhall do you honour, and your Names ſhall be had in Everlaſting Remembrace. Saints and Angels at your Entrance ſhall renew and raiſe their <hi>HALLELU JAHS;</hi> with whom you will joyn with tranſports of joy, Saying,</p>
