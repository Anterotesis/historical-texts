            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <hi>WHEREAS a Dialogue between a Father and Son, printed ſome time ago, met with a ſpeedy ſale, and was thought of ſome advantage, 'tis now thought that a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of ſaid Dialogue, may be ſtill more advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and it is committed to the preſs for that purpoſe.</hi>

                     <p>DEAR Son, you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that ſome conſiderable time ago, we took a rambling walk through the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards, fields and meadows, and cloſe by the ſide of the river, where we took a view of the bridges, mills and falls, and proceeded down the ſtream until it emptied itſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ocean, where the great ſhips traverſe the main, and go round the world, which is above twenty thouſand miles, or as the ſhips muſt ſail, to go round the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:048411_0004_1025347C888BF148"/>different capes of land, it will be above forty thouſand miles, before they can get back to the place from whence they ſat out.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Son.</speaker>
                     <p>I very well remember that agreeable walk, and ſhould be glad to take another ſuch, if you would go with me.—But I never could underſtand how the ſhips could go round the world, when there is ſo much land as well as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Father.</speaker>
                     <p>Dear ſon, it is not ſtrange that you ſhould not fully underſtand it, for there are many men that cannot fully comprehend it. But when you are older and have read ſome books on geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, and had an opportunity alſo to ſee a terreſtial globe, where the globe is divided into land and wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and where the tract of Lord
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:048411_0005_102534818D0D8D80"/>Arſon and Capt. Cook, is marked out on the globe, you may eaſily conceive how they may go round the world, and return again to the place from which they ſat out.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Son.</speaker>
                     <p>Truly ſir, I think it would be a very pleaſing ſtudy, and I hope that I ſhall ſoon be ready to begin it, for I ſhould be greatly pleaſed to ſee how the globe is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into land and water, and to ſee where the different nations of the world live, and whether they be black or white, heathen or chriſtian, and what is the produce and manufacture of the different parts of the world.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Father.</speaker>
                     <p>'Tis truly a very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtudy, and at a proper time I ſhall be glad to inſtruct you therein, but at preſent we will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it, and talk of ſomething elſe.</p>
