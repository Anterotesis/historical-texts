            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>MATT. XXV. 21.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <hi>HIS LORD ſaid unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful Servant; thou haſt been faithful—</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS is part of our Saviour's well-known parable of the talents; the moral of which is in general this, That whatever powers and advantages of any kind, men ſeverally enjoy, are committed to them in truſt by the great Lord and Proprietor of all, to whom they are accountable for the uſe they make of them; and from whom they ſhall, in the cloſe of this preſent ſcene, receive either a glorious recompence of
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:007256_0005_102B46673AA1B848"/>
their fidelity, or the puniſhment due to their ſloth and wickedneſs. The ſubject, then, is very general, and equally intereſting. All men, of whatever rank or character, are concerned in it. It leads our thoughts from what we poſſeſs, up to the great ſource thereof; from what we are at preſent, to what we ſhall be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. It connects this world with another; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends both our probationary and final ſtate, under the righteous adminiſtration of God.</p>
            <p>BUT tho' the ſubject is very general, and of the laſt importance to all; yet civil power being one of the principal of thoſe talents which Heaven commits to men, and the preſent occaſion requiring a more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar conſideration of it, the enſuing diſcourſe will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined thereto. Nor would I injure our honoured Rulers by the leaſt ſuſpicion, that they can poſſibly take it amiſs to be reminded of their duty to God and Man upon this occaſion, with all the plainneſs and ſimplicity becoming a miniſter of the Goſpel, and conſiſtent with decency; the rules of which, it is hoped, will not be violated.</p>
            <p>INDEED were One to diſcourſe upon this ſubject be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Rulers in an arbitary government; or before un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful Rulers, even where the conſtitution is free; there would be almoſt a neceſſity of diſguiſing and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the truth, on one hand, or of giving umbrage on the other. A miſerable dilemma! But ſurely there
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:007256_0006_102B4668D0A39520"/>
can be no neceſſity of the former, nor any danger of the latter, under ſuch a government as the Britiſh, and before ſuch Rulers as I have the honour to ſpeak to.</p>
            <p>IT is cuſtomary for thoſe who are called to ſpeak upon ſuch public occaſions, to apologize for their want of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per qualifications for the taſk. But how much reaſon ſoever they may often have for this, I think it is uſually their unhappineſs not to be tho't very ſincere in doing it. I ſhall therefore wholly omit this common ceremony; becauſe I would fain be thought quite in earneſt in every thing I ſay before ſo grave and venerable an auditory, and upon ſo important an occaſion.</p>
            <p>IT may not be improper, in the firſt place, to ſpeak of the ſource and origin of civil power: And then, of the great end of government: Which two particulars will be diſpatched in a few words. In the third place, it will be uſeful to recollect ſome of thoſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by which thoſe who are veſted with authority, ſhould be induced to exerciſe it with fidelity, ſuitable to the deſign of it. And ſo the ſubject will be cloſed with ſome reflections, chiefly relative to this Anniverſary, and to the preſent ſtate of the Province.</p>
            <p>As to the ſource and origin of civil power; the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble on which my diſcourſe is grounded, ſuggeſts that it is ultimately derived from God, whoſe "kingdom rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth over all;" this being as truly a talent committed
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:007256_0007_102B466B34165DA8"/>
by Him to the fidelity of men, as any thing elſe can be. In this light it is conſidered in the holy ſcriptures. It is not only agreable to the original ſcheme and plan of God's univerſal government, that civil rule ſhould take place among men, in ſubordination to His own; but his providence is actually concerned in raiſing thoſe perſons to power and dominion, who are poſſeſſed of it. In the language of the Prophet, <q>Wiſdom and might are His. He removeth kings, and ſetteth up kings. The moſt High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomſoever he will.</q> The language of the apoſtles is not leſs emphatical. They tell us that <q>there is no power, but of God; that the powers that be, are ordained of God; and that they are God's Miniſters.</q>
            </p>
            <p>BUT then it is to be remembred, that this power is derived from God, not immediately, but mediately, as other talents and bleſſings are. The notions of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular form of government explicitly inſtituted by God, as deſigned for a univerſal model; of the divine right of monarchy, in contradiſtinction from all other modes; of the hereditary, unalienable right of ſucceſſion; of the deſpotic, unlimited power of kings, by the immediate grant of Heaven; and the like; theſe notions are not drawn from the holy ſcriptures, but from a far leſs pure and ſacred fountain. They are only the divices of lawned paraſites, or other graceleſs politicians, to ſerve
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:007256_0008_102B466D84585DA0"/>
the purpoſes of ambition and tyranny. And tho' they are of late date, yet being traced up to their true original, they will be found to come, by uninterrupted ſucceſſion, from him who was a politician from the beginning.</p>
            <p>GOD did indeed formerly take one nation under his more immediate care and patronage, eſtabliſhing therein a kind of civil polity. But with this, the other nations of the world had no concern; nor were they required to imitate it. It might be added, that even this common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was not moulded and modeled wholly by the immediate dictates of Heaven. <hi>Moſes,</hi> who ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times conſulted God in the Mount, at other times con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted his father-in-law <hi>Jethro</hi> in <hi>Midian,</hi> the prince and prieſt of that country. By whoſe advice, tho' a mere pagan, it was that the great <hi>Hebrew</hi> lawgiver, partly framed his government. And it is to be obſerved, that this government did not put on the regal form at all, till after a long time; and then, in expreſs contradiction to the counſel of the Prophet, God declaring that this people rejected Him, in requeſting a king. To ſay the leaſt, monarchical government has no better foundation in the oracles of God, than any other. And after the eſtabliſhment of it amongſt the Hebrews, the crown, inſtead of deſcending uniformly to the elder branch of the male line, was often beſtowed on a younger; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times transferred to another family; and ſometimes even into another tribe: And this not without the divine approbation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:007256_0009_102B4670478B1760"/>
ALL the different conſtitutions of government now in the world, are immediately the creatures of man's mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not of God's. And indeed the veſtiges of human imperfection are ſo manifeſt in them, that it would be a reproach to the all-wiſe God to attribute them directly to Him. And as they are the creatures of man's mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſo from man, from common conſent, it is that lawful rulers immediately receive their power. This is the channel in which it flows from God, the original ſource of it. Nor are any poſſeſſed of a greater por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, than what is conveyed to them in this Way. Or at leaſt, if they have any more, they have it only as the thief or the robber has the ſpoil, which fraud or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence has put into his hands. Agreably to what is here ſaid, concerning the medium or channel thro' which power is derived from God, government is ſpoken of in ſcripture, as being both the ordinance of God, and the ordinance of man: Of God, in reference to His original plan, and univerſal Providence; and of man, as it is more immediately the reſult of human prudence, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and concert.</p>
            <p>IN the SECOND place, we are juſt to mention the great end of government. And after the glory of God, which we uſually conſider as the end of all things in general, that can be no other than the good of man, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon benefit of ſociety. This is equally evident whether we conſider it as a divine, or an human inſtitution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:007256_0010_102B4671D87E0118"/>
As it is God's ordinance, it is deſigned for a bleſſing to the world. It is inſtituted for the preſervation of mens perſons, properties &amp; various rights, againſt fraud and lawleſs violence; and that, by means of it, we may both procure, and quietly enjoy, thoſe numerous bleſſings and advantages, which are unattainable out of ſociety, and being unconnected by the bonds of it. It is not conceiveable that the all-wiſe and good God, ſhould or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain government amongſt men, but with a view to its being ſubſervient to their happineſs, and well-being in the world: to be ſure, not, that it might be ſubſervient to a contrary one, their miſery. We cannot imagine it poſſible that He who is good unto all, and whoſe tender mercies are over all his works, ſhould exalt a few perſons to power over the reſt, to be their oppreſſors; or merely for their own ſakes, that they may amaſs riches, that they may live in eaſe and ſplendor, that they may riot on the produce of other's toil, and receive the homage of mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, without doing them any good. It were blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous to think that God has inſtituted government for ſuch a partial, unworthy end.</p>
            <p>So far as God interpoſed in founding the common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> it was in favour to his choſen people that he did it: not that they might be oppreſſed and enſlaved by their own Rulers; but that they might be delivered from oppreſſion and ſlavery and their taſkmaſters in <hi>Egypt:</hi> And that, being brought out of the houſe of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:007256_0011_102B4674AE086C80"/>
they might be conducted into a good land, flowing with milk &amp; honey; that they might there poſſeſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, enjoy the bleſſing of equal laws, and be happy. Nor is the general deſign of government and magiſtracy now, throughout the world, different from what it was among the Iſraelites; viz. the happineſs of men. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly the apoſtle tells us that the civil magiſtrate "is the miniſter of God to us for good," and from hence argues the reaſonableneſs of ſubmitting to his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. And all the inſtructions &amp; admonitions which God has given to rulers in his word, exactly correſpond to this declared end of their inſtitution. The end of government then, as it is a divine ordinance, muſt be human felicity.</p>
            <p>AND if we conſider it as it is more immediately the ordinance of man, the end muſt evidently be the ſame. It being founded in, and ſupported by, common conſent, it is impoſſible the deſign of it ſhould be any other: ſince we cannot ſuppoſe that men would voluntarily enter into ſociety, and ſet up and maintain a common autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, upon any other principles than thoſe of mutual ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity and common good. Nor is there any medium betwixt ſuch common conſent as is here intended, and plain lawleſs force and violence; for which Chriſtians, ſurely, ought not to be advocates. Some ſtates may have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="9" facs="unknown:007256_0012_102B467686347C58"/>
not to be drawn into example, or to have any regard paid to them, when we are ſpeaking of the end of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. We ought not to take our eſtimate of the deſign hereof, from the views of banditti, and robbers, aſſociated to plunder and oppreſs others: (tho' even they have a common intereſt which they profeſs to regard, and which keeps them together.) But we are to form our idea of this end, by what reaſon ſuggeſts muſt be the motive with reaſonable and honeſt men to unite to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the bonds of ſociety. And if we judge by this rule, the end of government muſt be the common good of all, and of every individual, ſo far as is conſiſtent therewith.</p>
            <p>We are therefore brought exactly to the ſame point at laſt, whether we conſider government as it is originally an appointment of Heaven, or, more immediately, the voluntary choice of men. The ſecurity and happineſs of all the members compoſing the political body, muſt be the deſign and end thereof, conſidered in both theſe lights. God is too good to ordain it for any other Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes; and men, at leaſt love themſelves too well, to chuſe it from any other principles: Unleſs, perhaps we may ſuppoſe that a farther deſign of political union, is the defence and patronage of other perſons, out of the ſociety; and the doing of good to all, as opportunity is, in providence, afforded for it. But if this is really any end at all; yet it being only a ſecondary and remote one, it might have been paſſed over in ſilence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:007256_0013_102B46781212D8A8"/>
BUT tho' the grand end of government under all its different forms, is one, the good of the political body; this general end admits of various ſubdiviſions, and is proſecuted in a variety of ways; to ſpeak of which is quite beyond the deſign of this diſcourſe: and indeed that would be to deliver a ſyſtem of politicks, rather than a ſermon. I ſhall therefore only add under this head, that as the happineſs of men in ſociety depends greatly upon the goodneſs of their morals, and as morals have a cloſe connection with religion, the latter as well as the former, ought doubtleſs to be encouraged by the civil magiſtrate; not only by his own pious life &amp; good example; but alſo by his laws, as far as is conſiſtent with the natural, unalie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable rights of every man's conſcience. Protection is, in juſtice, due to all perſons indifferently, whoſe religion does not manifeſtly, and very directly, tend to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the government. And a general toleration, with this ſingle exception, is ſo far from being pernicious to ſociety, that it greatly promotes the good of it in many reſpects. Perſecution and intolerance, are not only un juſt, and criminal in the ſight of God; but they alſo cramp, enfeeble, and diminiſh the ſtate. And many ſtates, in other reſpects politic enough, have hereby greatly prejudiced themſelves, and ſtrengthened their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val neighbours. For what elſe is it, to butcher multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of their own people on religious accounts, as they have done; and to oblige others of them to betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to flight, with their effects and arts, into foreign
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:007256_0014_102B467B07142240"/>
countries, where they may live ſecurely? So that ſetting aſide the great impiety and unrighteouſneſs of this prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, the impolicy of it is a ſufficient argument againſt it. Nor, indeed, can it be doubted but that the intereſt of true religion, has been greatly prejudiced, by that notion which has ſo generally prev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">

            <p>THIRDLY: It is now time to mention ſome of thoſe arguments by which Rulers ſhould be induced to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe their power with fidelity, ſuitable to the great end and deſign of it.

                  </hi>
               </note> It belongs not to my function to determine how far this aſſertion will hold true. But I may venture to ſay, that if honeſty &amp; publick ſpirit are all that are wanting, there are not wanting arguments enough, ſounded in reaſon and religion, to engage Rulers to act from thoſe principles.</p>
            <p>To a generous mind, the public good, as it is the end of government, ſo it is alſo ſuch a noble and excellent one, that the proſpect of attaining it will animate the purſuit, and being attained, it will reward the pains. The very name of patriotiſm is indeed become a jeſt with ſome men; which would be much ſtranger than it is, had not ſo many others made a jeſt of the thing, ſerving their own baſe and wicked ends, under the pretext and colour of it. But there will be hypocrites in politicks, as well as in religion. Nor ought ſo ſacred a name to fall into contempt, however it may have been proſtituted &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faned, to varniſh over crimes. And thoſe times are <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous</hi> indeed, wherein <hi>men ſhall be</hi> only <hi>lovers of their own ſelves,</hi> having no concern for the good of the public. Shall we go to the pagans to learn this god-like virtue? Even they can teach it. And is there a Chriſtian, who is required to love all men, and to do good to all, as he may have opportunity for it; is there a Chriſtian, who does not love even his brethren, the members of the ſame body
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:007256_0016_102B467E83A9D208"/>
with himſelf? Is there a Chriſtian, who is void of all generous ſolicitude for his country's welfare? Is there, who has no deſire to ſee it in a proſperous and flouriſhing condition? Who has no pleaſure in actually ſeeing it ſo? Is there, who has no grief, in beholding its calamities? no diſpoſition to ſerve it? Such a perſon, tho' he were of a private character, would be a reproach not only to his religion, a religion of charity and beneficence, but even to our common nature, as corrupt and depraved as it is. But how much more infamous were this, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of a public character? in thoſe, on whom the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of their country, under providence, immediately depends?</p>
            <p>BUT it is not to be thought merely an office of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity and charity, for Rulers to exert themſelves in the ſervice of the public. This is an indiſpenſable duty of juſtice which they owe to it, by virtue of their ſtation. They have taken the care and guardianſhip thereof upon themſelves: yea they are commonly laid under the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn obligation of an oath, to ſtudy and purſue its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. And why are they honoured? why, rewarded by the public, but that the public may receive benefit from them? Here, then, are ties, if poſſible, more ſtrong and ſacred than thoſe of charity: ties, which being vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, leave the violators of them, guilty of manifeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, and great impiety.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:007256_0017_102B46802B428A08"/>
ANOTHER argument of ſome weight, is, that people are not uſually either ſo blind and inſenſible as not to know when they are well governed; or ſo ungrateful as not to acknowledge it, and to requite their benefactors ſuitably to their merits. Some men will, indeed be cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and find fault without reaſon: But it is a mere calumny to repreſent them of this turn and temper in general. All hiſtory ſcarce affords an example of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ruled with prudence, juſtice, and due clemency, but what lov'd and honour'd their Rulers; but what loudly proclaimed their vertues; but what, in all proper ways, requited their paternal care and goodneſs, while living, and reverenced their memory, when dead. And how much more deſireable is this, than for them to have their ears filled with cries, complaints and murmurings? How much more eligible is it, to live eſteemed, and to have their names tranſmitted with honour to poſterity, than to be the objects of public hatred, as being rather taſk-maſters than fathers; and to leave no remembrance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them, but of their ſelfiſhneſs and injuſtice; their unfaithfulneſs and oppreſſions?</p>
            <p>IT were, moreover, to be wiſhed, that Rulers (eſpecially Legiſlators, whom I have all along chiefly in view) would ſeriouſly conſider how much their own beloved poſterity may be affected by their counſels and conduct. The effect of public counſels and reſolutions, whether good or bad, is not ſo tranſient as they are themſelves. Even re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:007256_0018_102B46831D3B4AA8"/>
generations often feel the conſequence of them. By wiſe and good laws, and a proper conduct in other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, the governors of a people, lay a foundation, by God's bleſſing, not only for the welfare of the generation preſent, but alſo for the proſperity of thoſe who may come after them. In doing which, they, in effect, leave the moſt valuable legacy to their own offspring; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, by a contrary conduct, they entail on them only mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery and ruin. This conſideration will be of great weight, not only with perſons of a truly patriot and public ſpirit; but even with all ſuch as are not <hi>without natural affection;</hi> with all, who would not have their memory curſed after they are gone, even by thoſe who ſhould <hi>riſe up, and call them bleſſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A FARTHER argument may be drawn from this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, that Rulers derive their power from God, and are ordained to be his <hi>miniſters for good.</hi> They are not only entruſted by man with the care of the public; but by God himſelf, the ſupreme lawgiver, that they may be the inſtruments of his goodneſs and munificence. This doctrine, that rulers are God's miniſters, and cloathed with authority delegated from Him, has far too often been made uſe of as a topic of compliment and adulation, in order to ſooth them, and puff them up with vain ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations. And ſo ſucceſsful have the ſervile adorers of Princes ſometimes been, in the management of it, as to make them conceit themſelves almoſt literally Gods, and
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:007256_0019_102B468511D9F240"/>
to think their ſubjects ſcarce better than brutes, made only for their ſervice. That the title intended, denotes their dignity, and the honour which they may juſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, no one can queſtion. But the grand inference they themſelves ought to draw from hence, is, that they ſhould imitate the juſtice and unwearied goodneſs of that God, whoſe miniſters they are; and exerciſe the power with which His providence has cloathed them, to that graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous end, for which it is given. When they proſecute the true intereſts of the public, and diffuſe happineſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round them, then, and only then, they act up to their honourable character. They then anſwer the noble pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes for which Heaven exalted them; and are ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the benevolent deſigns of providence, being <hi>workers together with God.</hi> And what can more animate a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate man to fidelity in his truſt, than this reflection, That while he is thus ſerving his generation, he is doing it <hi>according to the will of God?</hi> that he therein concurs with the deſigns of the greateſt and beſt of Beings, the Creator and Lord of all, who is good unto all? It is an honeſt joy, a pleaſure truly divine, that muſt reſult from ſuch conſcious integrity.</p>
            <p>CHRISTIAN Rulers ſhould, moreover, always have in view the example of our bleſſed Lord and Redeemer, to whom <hi>all power in Heaven and in earth is given.</hi> All his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>

the king foretold, who was to <hi>"reign in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs."</hi> After Him ſhould all the princes and rulers of the earth copy. And if they did ſo, the great object and end of their government, would be to bleſs mankind.</p>
            <p>BUT the argument ſuggeſted in my text, is of the greateſt weight and ſolemnity of any that can be tho't of; viz. the account which all men are to give of their conduct hereafter, to the judge of quick and dead. That ſame Lord, who has given to one of his ſervants five talents, to another two, and to another one, will come at the appointed time to reckon with them; and to render to every man according to his deeds. Nor are there any perſons who have more reaſon to aim at approving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Him, than civil Rulers, who have ſo great a charge. It is an eſtabliſhed maxim of God's equal go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that <q>unto whomſoever much is given, of him ſhall much be required.</q> Nor does He, at whoſe tribunal they are to appear, regard the perſons of princes any more than of their ſlaves. They are all equally His ſervants. Happy! thrice happy! thoſe who ſhall then be found faithful; for then ſhall they <hi>enter into the joy of their Lord.</hi> Not ſo, the ſlothful and wicked ſervant, who has either neglected, or wilfully miſapplied, the talents committed to him! Innumerable, alas! innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable are the miſeries and calamities which have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crued, and are daily accruing, to mankind, from the abuſe of that very power, which was deſigned to prevent
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:007256_0021_102B4688C8604D68"/>
them, and to be inſtrumental of good to all that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it. Heaven beholds theſe things: And ſhall not Heaven, at length, viſit for them! "Shall not the judge of all the earth do right!"</p>
            <p>RULERS ſurely, even the moſt dignified and powerful of them, ſhould not be ſo elevated with the thoughts of their power, as to forget from whom it comes; for what purpoſes it is delegated to them; whoſe impartial eye it is that ſurveys all their counſels, deſigns and actions; and who it is that will, one day, exact an account of their ſtewardſhip. If only the <hi>hand upon the wall,</hi> cauſed the haughty <hi>Babylonian's</hi> knees to ſmite one againſt another; what amazement will ſeize the proud oppreſſors of the earth, when they ſhall behold the <q>ſon of man coming in the clouds of Heaven, with all the holy angels with Him</q>! The apocalypſe of St. John informs us how different ſentiments <hi>the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men,</hi> ſhall then entertain of themſelves, from thoſe which they are too apt to entertain at preſent. You will then ſee many of thoſe who made the world tremble and ſtoop before them, in vain attempting to <hi>hide themſelves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains!</hi> But</p>
            <p>IT now remains to make ſome reflections upon this ſubject, and to apply it to the preſent occaſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:007256_0022_102B468B456A4AA0"/>
AND we are reminded by the preceeding diſcourſe, how great a bleſſing good government is; and what gratitude becomes thoſe whom God, in his providence, favours with it. Inconſiderate men are too apt to think government rather a burden, than a bleſſing; rather, as what ſome perſons have invented for their own particular advantage, than what God has inſtituted for the good of all. This is, under Him, the great guard and ſecurity of mens property, peace, religion, lives; of every thing here, for which it is worth while to live. And this is a bleſſing which Britiſh ſubjects enjoy, in as high a degree, perhaps, as any other people. It is their felicity to be governed by ſuch men, and by ſuch laws, as themſelves approve; without which their boaſted liberty wou'd, indeed, be but an empty name. The form of our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is juſtly the envy of moſt other nations; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of thoſe which have either no parliaments at all, or ſuch as may be baniſhed at the word and pleaſure of a tyrant; which comes much to the ſame thing. We have alſo, for ſeveral late reigns, been bleſſed with Princes too juſt &amp; good to encroach upon the rights of their ſubjects, and too wiſe to think that Britons can endure a chain. Happy had it been for ſome former Princes, as well as for their people, had they been endowed with the ſame moderation, juſtice and wiſdom!—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:007256_0023_102B468D353DF970"/>
PERSONS of a private character are, moreover, admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed of the reverence and ſubmiſſion, which they owe to government as it is God's ordinance; and as Rulers derive their power from him. Were this no more than an human inſtitution, yet it would, in the nature of the thing, demand great reſpect; that being neceſſary even to the preſervation of it in the world, and ſo, to peoples reaping thoſe numerous advantages which accrue from it. But when we reflect, that this is an appointment of Heaven, it ſuggeſts that we ſhould be ſubject even "for conſcience ſake;" and that we cannot behave undutifully towards our Rulers, without alſo rebelling againſt God. Nor is it eaſy to mention any duty which the goſpel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcates upon the conſciences of men, with greater ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, than that of paying due honour to Kings, and all that are in authority. However, it is not be forgotten, that as in all free conſtitutions of government, law, and not will, is the meaſure of the executive Magiſtrate's power; ſo it is the meaſure of the ſubject's obedience and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. The conſequence of which, I ſhall at preſent leave others to draw; only obſerving, that it is very ſtrange we ſhould be told, at this time of day, that loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty and ſlavery mean the ſame thing; tho' this is plainly the amount of that doctrine which ſome, even now, have the forehead to ventilate, in order to bring a reproach upon the <hi>Revolution,</hi> upon the preſent happy ſettlement
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:007256_0024_102B468EC24FFAE0"/>
of the crown, and to prepare us for the dutiful reception of an <hi>hereditary Tyrant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is moreover ſuggeſted by what has been ſaid upon this ſubject, how much care and integrity ſhould be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd in the choice of thoſe, who are to have a ſhare in government; that they may not be unworthy of it. If it ever happens in countries of liberty, that the conduct of public affairs falls into the hands of weak or diſhoneſt men, the people will ſcarce be the leſs miſerable, becauſe they had the choice of theſe men themſelves; tho' they will be the leſs to be pitied. People have, in ſome countries, been ſo regardleſs of their own welfare, as to give too much encouragement to deſigning men, who would prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe upon them; yea, as to make an infamous merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize of their hands and voices to the higheſt bidder, without any conſideration of merit, of capacity or incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to ſerve the public. It is not eaſy to determine, who are the moſt criminal, they who would make their way to places of power and truſt, by indirect means, or they who have ſo little concern for the welfare of their country, as to hearken to them, and to become the tools of their ambition and covetouſneſs. And how faithfully they are likely to ſerve their country, who ſet out with corrupting it; they who aſpire to a part in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by bribing the avaricious, by flattering the fooliſh, and making fine promiſes to the credulous; is not hard to conjecture.</p>

SIR <hi>Thomas More</hi> tells us, in his model of a common-wealth, that the wiſe and virtuous <hi>Utopians,</hi> 
               <q>take an oath, before they proceed to an election, that they will chuſe him whom they think meeteſt for the office: and that, if a man aſpires to an office, he is ſure never to compaſs it.</q> Some will perhaps think it a pity, that it is only an <hi>Utopia,</hi> an imaginary region, where ſuch maxims are ſaid to prevail.

As to men of real worth, it is a pity they ſhould be put upon violating their natural modeſty, by proclaiming their own ſuperiour qualifications for ſerving the publick; and by ſolliciting an acknowledgment hereof.

I am not willing to believe we are running ſo faſt into the evil practices and cuſtoms of other places; or ſo fond of imitating the faſhionable follies and vices of any, even of thoſe whom decency may perhaps require us to call <hi>our betters,</hi> as ſome would inſinuate that we are; and from hence prognoſticate our deſtruction. No: I will not believe but that we fear God, reverence the memory of our fore-fathers, love our country and ourſelves, more than to do thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that God will ſtill give us to ſee the good of his choſen.</p>
            <p>But long cuſtom requires that, upon this occaſion, I apply myſelf more particularly to our honoured Rulers; or, at leaſt, cuſtom will ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rene me from the imputation of preſumption in doing it. To you, therefore, the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlators and political Fathers of the country, I would now, with all proper humility and defference, direct my diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>I would not, much honoured Fathers, willingly go beyond my line in any reſpect. But ſurely I ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the proper duty of my ſtation, if I did not embrace the opportunity which this day affords me, to beſeech you, as you fear God, whoſe miniſters you are; as you love the country, whoſe welfare depends upon you; as
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:007256_0028_102B4697335E7788"/>
you regard that good name, which <hi>is</hi> as <hi>precious ointment,</hi> and <hi>rather to be choſen than great riches;</hi> as you have any concern for poſterity, even your own; as you would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the bleſſed peace of a good conſcience, in life and death; and, in fine, as you would be found of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon judge in peace, in the day of his appearing; if I did not beſeech and exhort you, by all theſe motives, to be faithful in the diſcharge of that truſt which is devolved upon you by God and man; to let no unworthy views influence your conduct; but in all things to conſult and proſecute the public good. You are very ſenſible, my Fathers, that this is your indiſpenſable duty. Your God, your king, your country, all expect this of you. Nor could you anſwer it to either of them; no, not even to yourſelves, ſhould you neglect it. It is, I truſt from a ſenſe of duty to God, in whoſe name I am now called to ſpeak, and from an affectionate concern for the welfare of my dear, native country, not from a vain affectation of putting on the monitor towards my ſuperiours, that I uſe this freedom of ſpeech, and ſuch importunity. And if it ſerves, in any meaſure, by the bleſſing of God, to awaken your zeal for His honour, and for the proſperity of this people, the intent of it is anſwered.</p>
            <p>THERE is but little probability, that thoſe who fear not God, will much regard man; or that they who have not an habitual ſenſe of His authority over themſelves, will exerciſe that which he has given them over others,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:007256_0029_102B4698C3D58588"/>
as they ought to do. Be pleaſed, therefore, always to bear in mind that glorious Being, who is ever with you: who ſpake all worlds into exiſtence; whoſe power ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and governs all things; in whoſe preſence no ſeraph is unveiled; at whoſe frown, apoſtate ſpirits trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; before whom all <q>the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: whoſe eyes ever view, and whoſe eyelids try the children of men: That righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lord who loveth righteouſneſs;</q> and under whoſe adminiſtration, all men ſhall at laſt find their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in an upright conduct, and in that alone. While you have a juſt ſenſe of theſe things upon your minds, you will purſue no unworthy ends: you will have the intereſt of the public at heart: you will be inquiſitive about the beſt meaſures of promoting it; and <q>attend continually upon this very thing.</q>
            </p>
            <p>IT is an important branch of the legiſlature for the enſuing year, that is this day to be choſen; a branch of great honour, weight and influence in the government. Beſides the known part which the gentlemen of that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable board, will have to act in a legiſlative capacity; they will have another, which demands, at leaſt, equal wiſdom, equal uprightneſs, equal fortitude; that of <q>freely giving advice, at all times, to the Governor, for the good management of the public affairs of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;</q> according to the form of their oath. The world does not abound with perſons, in whom all thoſe
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:007256_0030_102B469C051C1B00"/>
qualities concur, which render them fit for Adviſers and councellors, even in matters of far leſs moment. But ſuperiour wiſdom and diſcretion; a good knowledge of the nature of government in general; of the Britiſh in particular; of our charter rights, and this provincial conſtitution; a thorough acquaintance with the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the province, and with its true intereſts; a generous &amp; public ſpirit; great honeſty and intrepidity, ſuch as will not waver with every gale of popular breath, or any other breath; theſe ſurely are the qualities, which are naturally expected to be found, in all who have a ſeat at that reſpectable board. Should there be ever ſeen hereafter, (a ſuppoſition which I do not make without great reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; but ſhould there ever be ſeen hereafter) at the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil board, a perſon of a low capacity, of little knowledge and diſcretion; one, almoſt ignorant of the laws, govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and circumſtances, even of his own country; one, of a narrow, ſelfiſh, avaricious turn; one, of little integ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and little fortitude; one, afraid to diſcloſe his mind, when advice is to be given <q>freely for the good ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of the public affairs;</q> ſhould ſuch a one be ever ſeen hereafter at that board; this, ſurely would not ſeem very agreable to its known ſtyle and character of <hi>honourable.</hi> And all who are concerned in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching election, will regard thoſe qualities which tend to ſupport and juſtify that title; exerciſing a care pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate to the importance and dignity of ſuch a truſt:
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:007256_0031_102B469D8D2EA240"/>
I mean they will do ſo, provided they are actuated in this affair, by ſuch principles as become men and Chriſtians; the principles of fidelity to God, and love to the country. Taking it for granted therefore, that theſe are the principles which will govern in the enſuing choice, in oppoſition to thoſe of party, perſonal friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips and perſonal enmities; and to all private intereſt; taking this for granted, I ſay, I would now beg leave, honoured Fathers, to mention ſome other things that may poſſibly deſerve conſideration; tho' with great ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and defference, knowing that to preſcribe, is not my province.</p>
            <p>IT may be worth conſidering, whether we have not ſome laws in force, hardly reconcileable with that reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious liberty which we profeſs; and which the Royal charter expreſly requires ſhould be preſerved inviolate. A neighbouring colony, we know, has lately been repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded on account of ſome laws of a perſecuting aſpect. And whether ſome of our own, are of a genius and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion ſufficiently abhorrent from the ſame ſpirit, is not, perhaps, unworthy the conſideration of the legiſlature.</p>
            <p>THE ſtate of our College can neither be forgotten, nor enough lamented, by thoſe who wiſh to ſee learning duly honoured, and in a flouriſhing condition. Indeed if literature and the muſes chiefly haunted where poverty reſides—But this a thread-bare topic.—Long live the
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:007256_0032_102B469F45DBEC78"/>
names of our venerable fore-fathers, who did ſo much for the promotion of liberal ſcience, in the infant ſtate of the country! Long, the names of all the generous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors to this ſeminary of learning! Long, the names of HARVARD, STOUGHTON, HOLLIS, BERKELEY!</p>
            <p>THE want of ſome act effectually to ſettle claims and quiet poſſeſſions, eſpecially in the frontiers of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, is much complained of by many: not merely, as what renders private property too precarious; but alſo as what is prejudicial to the publick, in more reſpects than one.</p>
            <p>THERE is ſuch a ſpirit in ſome reſpects, now appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and growing, amongſt us, as being duly encouraged by the legiſlature, cannot, with the ordinary bleſſing of providence, but be of happy conſequence. We are grown pretty ſenſible of the importance of improving our lands, better than formerly; that ſo we may not be beholden for our daily bread, unleſs it is to Him, to whom we pray for it. It is not improbable, from the late experiments of ſome public ſpirited Gentlemen, that we might have a valuable ſtaple, by means of that fruit which delights ſo much in our ſoil; as well as greatly leſſen the importation of foreign liquors. Something conſiderable has, of late, been done towards the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of uſeful manufactures among us: none of which, it is to be hoped, will fall thro' and miſcarry, for want
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:007256_0033_102B46A1D92C0BC8"/>
of proper encouragement from the government. The fiſhery now of late projected, and carried on, from this Capital, cannot fail to be of great Advantage to it, in the low and declining ſtate of its commerce; and, indeed, to the whole province; at leaſt as long as the mortifying religion of lent, is upheld in foreign countries.—</p>
            <p>To theſe Things, which have a favourable aſpect, may be added the zeal ſhown by many for the introduction of foreign Proteſtants. It is large importations of this ſort, not of other European commodities, that has made one of our Britiſh provinces rich and populous, in the courſe of a few years; ſo that, of an inconſiderable ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement, it now vies with the greateſt and moſt opulent. And that which may, perhaps, render it the more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient thus to increaſe our numbers, is the probability that we ſhall, before long, have other employment than agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture, and the bleſſed arts of peace, for many of our own people: I mean, in curbing and chaſtizing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence of our neighbours on the Continent; neighbours, whoſe perfidy renders them a more formidable enemy even in peace, than either their number or bravery in war.</p>
            <p>IT is not a little ſurprizing to many perſons abroad, that this government has been at no greater expence, and taken no more pains, to civilize the natives of the country; and to propagate amongſt them the glorious
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:007256_0034_102B46A3D427CE28"/>
Goſpel of our Redeemer: Eſpecially conſidering one profeſſed deſign of our fore-fathers in coming hither, our own high pretenſions to religion, and our own intereſt. Indeed there is ſome reaſon to fear, that even the dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of perſons abroad, and entruſted with others here, in America, for carrying on ſo pious and good a deſign, have not always been applied with that care, impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality and faithfulneſs, which might have been juſtly expected But this not being a matter wherein the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is immediately concerned, I ſhall ſay no more of it: and ſome will, perhaps, think that even this is too much.</p>
            <p>IT is to be hoped that You, our honoured Rulers, will not neglect any means that are proper to be uſed by the government, to humanize and chriſtianize theſe poor Salvages. Charity requires this, and requires it the more, becauſe they will, otherwiſe, be in great danger of apoſtatizing from their natural paganiſm and barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, into that which is worſe, the religion of Rome; a religion, calculated rather to make men wicked, than to keep them from being ſo, or to reform them after they are become ſo. We know the great pains, and various artifices, that are uſed by the Romiſh miſſionaries, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them to this wicked religion. Nor can One well help calling to mind here, the words of our bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our: <q>Woe unto you;—for ye compaſs ſea and land to make one proſelyte; and when he is made, ye make him two-fold more the child of hell,</q> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:007256_0035_102B46A5D2AE8438"/>
BUT, as was intimated before, were compaſſion to the ſouls of theſe miſerable pagans wholly out of the caſe, even policy requires us to bring them, if poſſible, to embrace the proteſtant faith. This would be one great means, amongſt others not ſo proper to be mentioned in this place, of attaching them to the Britiſh intereſt: Whereas they will, otherwiſe, probably be our enemies. And what ſort of enemies we are to expect in them, is no hard matter to conjecture, ſince the great duties which the miſſionaries of Rome inculcate upon their ſavage converts, are thoſe of butchering and ſcalping Proteſtans: Generous enemies, doubtleſs, when their native ferocity is whetted and improved by a religion, that naturally delights in blood and murder!</p>
            <p>THAT which ſeems, at preſent, chiefly to engage the attention of the public, is the Britiſh ſettlements on the Continent being now, in a manner, encompaſſed by the French. And this is a matter of much more ſerious importance than it would be, were it not for the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous tribes of warlike natives on our back; who, it is to be feared, are more generally diſpoſed to fall in with that intereſt, than with ours. The principal reaſon of which is, doubtleſs, this; That our politic neighbours take much more pains to gain them over, than our colonies have hitherto done. Nor can it be thought a thing of his importance for us, by all means that are lawful and
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:007256_0036_102B46A85EE151B8"/>
practicable, to ſecure the friendſhip of the one, than it is to put a ſtop to the encroachments of the other. Indeed, whoever has the friendſhip of moſt, or all, of theſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, may probably, in time, become maſters of this part of the Continent. Whether we, or they who are now making ſuch a reſolute puſh for it, Heaven knows!<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Query,</hi> Whether, if the <hi>Society for propagating the Goſpel in foreign Parts,</hi> was well acquainted with the ſtate of religion in theſe parts of <hi>America,</hi> Gentlemen of ſo great piety, charity, and loyalty, would not rather ſend Miſſionaries among the Salvages; (by which they might, at once, both enlarge the Kingdom of Chriſt, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the number of his Majeſty's friends and ſubjects) than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to ſupport miſſions <hi>here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Some have ſuggeſted, that the Gentlemen of the worthy and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Society mentioned, are not unacquainted with theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. But is not this ſuppoſition very injurious? For if that is really the caſe, we muſt neceſſarily conclude they wretchedly pervert the deſign of the Charities intruſted with them; and that their great aim in ſupporting theſe miſſions, is not the converting of Heathens to Chriſtianity; but the converting of Chriſtians of <hi>other proteſtant denominations,</hi> to the faith of <hi>the church of England<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            </p>
            <p>The warlike preparations that are made and making, in our ſouthern colonies, prove that they are not unap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of what may be the conſequence of thoſe quick advances &amp; gigantic ſtrides, which the French are making towards us; the conſequence of the ſtrict alliances they are forming with thoſe Indians who are already our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; of their endeavours to ſecure ſuch as are yet neuters; and of their practices, and many artifices, to corrupt thoſe who are in amity with us. We, ſurely,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:007256_0037_102B46AA37F33248"/>
who have always diſtinguiſhed ourſelves by a jealouſy of our rights; by our loyalty; and our zeal for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon intereſt of his Majeſty's dominions on the Continent; We, ſurely, ſhall not be inattentive to theſe commotions, nor inactive when the general good, yea, the very being, of all theſe colonies is threatned. Shall not be inatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and inactive, did I ſay? We are not, we cannot be. We ſee from the late conduct of our neighbours, from their recent encroachments, and unprovoked hoſtilities, (unleſs to breath on our own territories be a provocation to ſuch men) we ſee from theſe things, in what manner all controverſies about bounds &amp; limits, are to be ſettled; how very amicably! Punic faith! unleſs perhaps, Gallic is become ſufficiently proverbial. No one that is not an abſolute ſtranger to their ambition, to their policy, to their injuſtice, to their perfidiouſneſs, can be in any doubt what they aſpire at.</p>
            <p>AND, indeed, the progreſs they have made in a ſhort time, might ſeem ſtrange, were it not for their union amongſt themſelves, and for the nature of their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The ſlaves are content to ſtarve at home, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to injure free-men abroad, and to extend their terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories by violence and uſurpation. Their late conduct may well alarm us; eſpecially conſidering our diſunion, or at leaſt want of a ſufficient bond of union, amongſt ourſelves: An inconvenience, which, it is to be hoped,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:007256_0038_102B23DF91AC6DE8"/>
we ſhall not always labour under. And whenever all our ſcattered rays ſhall be drawn to a point and proper focus, they can ſcarce fail to conſume and burn up theſe enemies of our peace, how faintly ſoever they may ſtrike at preſent. What UNION can do, we need only look towards thoſe Provinces, which are diſtinguiſhed by the name of the UNITED, to know. But in the mean time, each government that conſiders its own true intereſt, will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtly concur in ſuch meaſures as are neceſſary and practicable, for the common ſafety.</p>
            <p>OUR preſent ſituation, my Fathers, calls to mind that of the tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſurrounded and haraſſed by their common enemies, at a time when they were under no common direction. Then it was that <q>
                  <hi>Judah</hi> ſaid unto <hi>Simeon</hi> his brother, come up with me into my lot, that we may fight againſt the Canaanites; and I alſo will go up with thee into thy lot; ſo <hi>Simeon</hi> went with him.</q> Tho' peace is very deſireable, upon juſt and honourable terms, yet we know very well, that God's ancient people were not wont to be frighted out of their poſſeſſions; nor patiently to endure the incurſions and ravages of their neighbours. And I am ſure there is not a true New-England-Man, whoſe heart is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready engaged in this conteſt; and whoſe purſe, and his arm alſo, if need be, is not ready to be employed in it; in a cauſe, ſo juſt in the ſight of God and man; a cauſe,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:007256_0039_102B46AC4127A398"/>
ſo neceſſary for our own ſelf-defenſe; a cauſe wherein our liberties, our religion, our lives, our bodies, our ſouls, are all ſo nearly concerned. We have, indeed, of late done ſomething to ſecure ourſelves, and are doing more. We have <hi>put our hand to the plough;</hi> and he that <hi>looks back,</hi> is ſo far from being worthy the privileges of a <hi>citizen of Heaven,</hi> that he is not worthy to enjoy the rights of an <hi>Engliſhman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE are morally ſure from the ſteps which our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours are taking, that there muſt, ſooner or later, be ſome great turn of affairs upon this Continent, which will put it out of our power, or out of theirs, to diſpute about boundaries: We have heard their threats, and inſolent menaces; we have ſeen their more inſolent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour. And what a turn may be given to the affairs of Europe, ſhould Heaven permit Gallic policy and perfidy to prevail here over Engliſh valour, I need not ſay, and even tremble to think! We are peaceably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending our ſettlements upon our own territories; they are extending theirs beyond their own, by force of arms. We muſt meet at length; which cannot be without a violent concuſion: and the time ſeems not to be far off. In ſhort, their conduct muſt be very different from what it has all along been, eſpecially of late, before we ſhall have any reaſon to think, that we can live in peace and good neighbourhood with them, how much ſoever we

As the apoſtle ſaid to the mariners, after aſſuring them of deliverance from the impending dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, "Except theſe abide in the ſhip, ye cannot be
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:007256_0043_102B46B498AAED18"/>
ſaved;" ſo it may be ſaid to our Britiſh colonies, Ye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaved from the ſtorm you are now threatned with, yea, which is already begun, except ye are at union amongſt your ſelves; and exert your ſtrength together, for your common intereſt. Upon this condition, you are ſafe, even without a miracle: otherwiſe, nothing ſhort of one can ſave you. And can you, without the utmoſt indignation, think of becoming a prey to thoſe who are ſo much inferior to you in all reſpects, meerly for want of unanimity, public ſpirit, the manly reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your fore-fathers, and a little expence!</p>
            <p>IT is not, may it pleaſe your Excellency, (for to You, Sir, I muſt now beg leave more particularly to direct my diſcourſe; It is not) one of the leaſt felicities of this province, to have at the Head of it, a gentleman ſo well acquainted with its true intereſt, ſo capable of ſerving it, and ſo heartily diſpoſed to do it, as we have reaſon to think your Excellency is. We have had experience of your warm zeal for his Majeſty's ſervice, and for the welfare of this his moſt loyal province. In the long war during your adminiſtration, had all concerned been, I will not preſume to ſay, equally faithful, but, equally ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful, neither the European, nor the American Dunkirk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> would probably have been a port and fortification at this day; or, which is ſtill better, they might have been in other hands than they are at preſent. However we, in ſome meaſure, reap the happy fruits of your ſubjecting the
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:007256_0044_102B46B7CA99C690"/>
latter of them to the Britiſh crown, in the change of our medium; and are likely, by God's bleſſing, to reap them in much greater perfection hereafter, when time has matur'd them.</p>
            <p>THE zeal which your Excellency has lately ſhown with relation to the encroachments and hoſtilities of our bad neighbours, gives us aſſurance, Sir, that nothing will be wanting, on your part, towards their meeting with timely and effectual oppoſition. And the ready concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the other branches of the legiſlature, with what you was pleaſed to propoſe to the laſt General Aſſembly, at once ſhows the confidence that is placed in you, and renders it probable, at leaſt, that no neceſſary ſupplies will be wanting hereafter, in order to proſecute deſigns of this nature; whether of erecting fortreſſes for our own ſecurity, or of demoliſhing in ſeaſon, thoſe of our injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and treſpaſſing neighbours. <hi>Crown-Point, Crown-Point,</hi> will ſurely be a laſting Monument of the danger of delays in ſuch Caſes!</p>
            <p>IT is upon your Excellency, under God and the King, that we chiefly depend for protection and happineſs. We are ſenſible how much you have the union of theſe colonies at heart. Nor can we, without an implicit taxing of your former adminiſtration, which we would be far from doing, doubt but that, for the future, you will uſe all your power and influence for the good of
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:007256_0045_102B46B9997E36F0"/>
this province in particular; and of all His Majeſty's do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions on this Continent in general. You will never forget, Sir, whoſe miniſter you are; what God, the King, and this people, reaſonably expect from You, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the paternal relation in which you ſtand towards us.</p>
            <p>IN ſome reſpects we have peculiar need of a faithful and ſkilful pilot at this time. By the looks of the clouds, we are to expect bad weather; ſuch as will require an experienced and reſolute mariner to carry us ſafely and happily thro' it. But if that which has the appearance of a long and violent ſtorm gathering, or rather actually breaking upon us, ſhould ſoon blow over, and leave us a clear ſky; yet even when the Heavens are ſerene, and the gale proſperous, it demands at leaſt an upright heart, (ſuch a one as we truſt your Excellency is poſſeſſed of) to keep the ſtate in the right channel, and ſteer her to her true felicity.</p>
            <p>AND as we are confident, Sir, you will in all things do the duty of a good Governour towards us; ſo it is to be hoped, that Your public ſervices will never meet with an ungrateful return from us. But I may venture, at leaſt, to aſſure Your Excellency, that none of Your good deeds ſhall be forgotten by our common Maſter in Heaven. He, whoſe providence has put you into this place of honour and truſt, will ſurely recompence all the diligence and fidelity which you have ſhown in it already,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:007256_0046_102B46BB273DB338"/>
or ſhall ſhow hereafter, <hi>at the reſurrection of the juſt.</hi> Nor can we wiſh You, Sir, any greater felicity, than that You may, in every reſpect, diſcharge this important truſt in ſuch a manner, as to have His approbation at the laſt; and to be accounted a <hi>good and faithful ſervant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I could not, with propriety, and in due conſiſtency with the eſtabliſhed form of our government, apply my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf particularly to his Majeſty's Council for the preſent political year, now expiring, unleſs it were with relation to the new Election this afternoon, wherein they are to bear a part. But having nothing to add upon that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, to what has been ſaid already, to them in common with others concerned; It is humbly hoped, that the omiſſion of a particular addreſs to that honourable Board, will not be imputed even to forgetfulneſs, much leſs, to any diſreſpect.</p>
            <p>THE honourable Houſe of Repreſentatives, at the command of whoſe predeceſſors it is, that I appear in this place, will indulge me in a ſhort application to them.</p>
            <p>As You, honoured Gentlemen, are delegated imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately by the good people of the Province, to repreſent, and act for, them; You are, if poſſible, under a nearer and ſtricter obligation, to regard their welfare, than the other branches of the legiſlature. You are more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the guardians of their rights and privileges. It is, therefore, to be preſumed, that you will always be zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:007256_0047_102B46BE79027798"/>
to maintain them; and not only ſo, but, in all things, ſtudious of their real and beſt intereſt. Private, perſonal intereſt, You are very ſenſible, has nothing to do in the ſupreme Court of the province. You are not deputed hereto by your conſtituents, Gentlemen, that you may proſecute your particular intereſts, or the intereſts of others, any farther than they coincide with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good, and are involved in it. Nor can you be at any loſs, what ought to be done to the vile, mercenary tongue, that ſhould toil; what, to the guilty hand, that <hi>right hand of falſhood,</hi> which ſhould either be lifted up, or kept down, to ſerve the particular ends of any man or party whatever, to the detriment of the public! Such things are indeed, almoſt too infamous and horrid, to be ſuppoſed poſſible, in a Chriſtian country. But alas! it is a degenerate world, if not a corrupt age of it, that we live in!—</p>
            <p>HOWEVER, it were very injurious to ſuſpect, honoured Gentlemen, but that You are all aſſembled here, from different parts of the land, with upright views, and an ardent love to your country. And if You mean to ſerve the public, as doubtleſs you do, you will always <hi>ſtudy the things that make for peace,</hi> both amongſt yourſelves, and with the other branches of the legiſlature: For it is by theſe things only, that the common-wealth is <hi>edified:</hi> not, ſurely, by party diſputes and factions; not by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged animoſities, and ſtudied oppoſitions; which
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:007256_0048_102B46C0ED36C4A0"/>
greatly diſhonor and weaken any government; and have both their origin and end in evil. They who promote and foment them, have always ſomething elſe in view than, what they would be tho't to have, the public good. This is, indeed, always the pretence; but private pique, or private intereſt, or a general temper and turn to wrangling, is at the bottom. It is, uſually at leaſt, the purſuit of ſeperate, diſtinct intereſts, and a want of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſpirit, that is the ſource of party and contentions in any ſtate. When all are united heartily in the main end, having nothing ſo much in view, as the good of the public; party names, diſtinctions, and diſputes, vaniſh of courſe; and that unanimity and harmony take place, which give both beauty and ſtrength to government; and without which, the public affairs cannot be carried on, to advantage. A public ſpirit, is a ſpirit of union; and union is the ſource of public happineſs: and public happineſs is the great end which you ſhould have in view.</p>
            <p>As you, honoured Gentlemen, have a diſtinct part in the legiſlature, nothing conſiderable can be done without You, for the public good; and I may add, or contrary to it: tho' I am far from thinking, that this is deſigned by any. God forbid! But the granting of monies, a thing of the utmoſt importance, lies more immediately with <hi>You.</hi> And tho' you will always have a tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:007256_0049_102B46C27880B4D8"/>
for the intereſt of your reſpective conſtituents, yet You will have a greater, for the good of the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; to be ſure, for the common intereſt of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's dominions on this Continent. Nor will You be over thrifty, when <hi>that</hi> calls for liberality. And this will probably be the caſe before it is long, if it is not actually ſo already.</p>
            <p>I ſpeak now with particular reference to the neceſſary defence of this, and all theſe colonies, againſt thoſe who are making inroads upon us; and who have, even with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſpace of a few weeks, had the hardineſs to commit ſuch hoſtilities as are not to be endured, unleſs we are determined to ſit down in inglorious eaſe, and patiently to look on, while our trade with the natives is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed from us; our fortreſſes, taken; our friends and brethren, captivated, butchered, ſcalped; our fields, laid waſte; our territories, poſſeſſed by thoſe that hate us; and the Britiſh intereſt on the Continent brought to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Peace is a great bleſſing; peace is what we would chuſe; peace is the deſire of all who deſerve the name of Chriſtians. But ſhall the trumpet ſleep? Shall the ſword ruſt? Shall our gold and ſilver lye cankering in our coffers? Shall our military garments be moth-eaten for want of uſe, when ſuch things are doing! It is impoſſible, Gentlemen, you ſhould be any ways back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or parſimonious, in ſuch a cauſe as this; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> cauſe
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:007256_0050_102B46C4B349EDB8"/>
wherein the glory of God, the honour of your King, and the good of your country, are ſo deeply concerned; I might perhaps add, a cauſe, whereon the liberties of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope depend. For of ſo great conſequence is the empire of North America, (and that, you are ſenſible, is the thing now aimed at by our neighbours) that it muſt turn the ſcale of power greatly in favour of the only Monarch, from whom thoſe liberties are in danger; and againſt that Prince, who is the grand ſupport and bulwark of them. Conſider then, Gentlemen, in the name of God, conſider, what you owe Him, and to your holy religion; what, to the proteſtant intereſt in general; what, to your King and to Great-Britain, in particular; what, to your native country; what, to the honour of your Anceſtors; what, to the preſent generation; what, to future ones; what, to yourſelves; and what, to thoſe whom the God of nature has made dearer to you than yourſelves, your children. It is even uncertain, Gentlemen, how long you will have an <hi>Houſe</hi> to ſit in, unleſs a ſpeedy and vigorous oppoſition is made to the preſent encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to the farther deſigns, of our enemies! This, ſurely, is not a time to be ſaving, unleſs in our private expences.</p>
            <p>AND while I am ſpeaking of grants for the common good, I cannot but juſt add, That neither the honour of the Province can be promoted, at preſent, nor its true
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:007256_0051_102B46C7A9622978"/>
intereſt, in the end, by great parſimony towards thoſe who ſerve the public in a public capacity; and receive ſalaries from it. There is another thing which I would beg leave to hint at here. So far, honoured Gentlemen, as fixing the proportion which the different parts of the Community are reſpectively to bear in the public Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, lies with You, You will doubtleſs be far from deſiring, that any particular part, ſhould bear a greater proportion than is juſt and equal; being regulated by its ability and circumſtances relatively conſidered. You are too religious, juſt and impartial to deſire this.<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <p>A certain part of this Community (which ſurely there is no need of mentioning!) has fallen under ſuch great decays and difficulties of late, thro' that ſame Providence, which has been ſmiling upon the other parts of the Province; that I verily believe righteous Heaven will be juſtly and greatly provoked, unleſs ſome pity and relief is afforded to it. Poor <hi>BOSTON!</hi> once the Glory of Britiſh America, What art thou coming to! What, rather, art thou come to already!—</p>

IN fine, honoured Gentlemen, I perſwade myſelf, that you will, in all your debates and conſultations, in all you do in your political, as well as private capacity, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber you are to give an account of yourſelves to the all-knowing, all-juſt, and impartial Judge of the world. And if you keep this moſt ſolemn and awful truth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt in your minds, it will be almoſt impoſſible for you to do amiſs. You will then act, in all reſpects, with ſuch a diſintereſted view to the common good of your country; with ſuch unblemiſhed, irreproachable integ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as will be both acceptable to God your Saviour, and to thoſe for whom you act; with ſuch prudence and fidelity, at leaſt, as will afford no handle to perſons of captious tempers, and licentious tongues, under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of blaming <hi>former Houſes,</hi> to couch a real and juſt ſarcaſm on the <hi>preſent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF any thing has been ſaid in this diſcourſe, not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently conformable to the uſual ſtyle of the pulpit; if, any thing that approaches too near to politicks; if the diſcourſe has not been enough confined to matters alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſpiritual; if our temporal and worldly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have been too long dwelt upon; in fine, if there has been any greater liberty of ſpeech uſed; if, any greater pathos of expreſſion, than becomes an Engliſh ſubject, a lover of his country, and a proteſtant Miniſter, upon ſuch an occaſion, and at ſuch a juncture, as the preſent;
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:007256_0053_102B46CADF495E70"/>
if this is the caſe, as perhaps it is, the great candor of the audience is humbly relied on, to make the <hi>moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable apology,</hi> that the nature of the thing will admit of, for him that has thus tranſgreſſed. And <hi>that</hi> will be, at leaſt, as good a one, as any he could make for himſelf, ſhould he attempt one. But an apology would certainly be neceſſary in <hi>another</hi> reſpect, were this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe protracted to a much greater length. My Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend fathers and brethren in the miniſtry, will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore readily excuſe me, if I do not honour myſelf by a particular addreſs to them, as is cuſtomary upon theſe occaſions: Tho' the ſubject I have been upon, is very applicable, not only to civil Rulers; but alſo to thoſe whom our bleſſed Lord has <hi>counted faithful, putting them into the miniſtry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HOWEVER, I cannot conclude without juſt reminding this great aſſembly, That all men have certain talents committed to them, for which they are accountable to him that gave them. The leaſt and loweſt of us need not live without honouring God, in ſome way or other, and being, in a degree, ſerviceable to the world. Nor ſhall any one that is faithful to his truſt, loſe his reward; tho' he is ſo far from being in a capacity to do great and extenſive good in his generation, that he can only <q>give a cup of cold water to a diſciple in the name of a diſciple. For if there be firſt a willing mind, it is
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:007256_0054_102B46CC90542148"/>
accepted according to that a man hath, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that he hath not. As we have many members in one body, and all members have not the ſame office; ſo we, being many, are one body in Chriſt, and members one of another. Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether miniſtry, let us wait on our miniſtring; or he that exhorteth, on exhortation; he that giveth, let him do it in ſimplicity; he that ruleth, with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; And, in all of us, let love be without diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation, while we abhor that which is evil, and cleave to that which is good.</q> Thus, thro' faith, and patience in well doing, ſhall we at length <q>inherit the promiſes:</q> for "he is faithful that has promiſed."</p>
            <p>WE muſt unavoidably concern ourſelves, in ſome meaſure, about the things of this mortal life, ſo long as it ſhall pleaſe the Father of ſpirits to continue us in it. But our great intereſt lies in another region, far beyond the ſphere and verge of mortality. And whoſoever is faithful to the death, ſhall receive a crown of life, that fadeth not. There is nothing here, Men, Brethren and Fathers! there is nothing here, that can claim our higheſt love and affections. "All that cometh is vanity." Riches take to themſelves wings; pleaſures pall; "favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain." <q>All things are full of change,</q> and in perpetual rotation. <q>The faſhion of the world paſſeth away;</q> and God alone
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:007256_0055_102B46CE90452940"/>
is without <hi>variableneſs,</hi> and <hi>ſhadow of turning.</hi> Even all the kingdoms of the earth, tho' they had their foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons laid in iron and braſs &amp; adamant, muſt ſooner or later, be diſſolved; and their place be no where found. All empire ſhall be blotted out, exceping HIS, <q>of whom, and thro' whom, and to whom, are all things.</q> All ſhall terminate in a <hi>Monarchy,</hi> truly <hi>univerſal.</hi> The kingdom of the glorious <hi>Mediator,</hi> ſhall firſt break in pieces, conſume, and abſorb all inferiour ones. And when He ſhall have <q>put down all rule, and all au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and power, and ſubdued all things unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, then cometh the end,</q> when, as the ſcriptures inform us, even He ſhall no longer reign; but <q>deliver up the kingdom to GOD, even the FATHER, that put all things under him; that GOD may be ALL IN ALL.</q>
