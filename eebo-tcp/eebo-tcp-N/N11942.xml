            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>THE Author declares his abhorrence of a bigotted attachment to the low ſingulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a party, and profeſſes to act on the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent and catholic principles of the goſpel; therefore hopes his readers will not conceive any obnoxious idea from the word CHURCH, as he uſes it in this diſcourſe, nor indulge or give way to jealouſy and prejudice ſo far, as once to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that he means by this term, to point out any one denomination of Chriſtians, excluſive of all others—as diſtinguiſhed by their location and other peculiarities. The church, in his ſenſe of it, includes all the worthy profeſſors of chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, who conduct themſelves on their probation here, as thoſe that expect to be judged hereafter, by the great evangelical law of liberty. He fully believes the Apoſtle, when he ſays, "where the ſpirit of the Lord is, there is liberty;" and doubts not, but this ſpirit has been plentifully poured out, not only in the New-England colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, but likewiſe on his Epiſcopalian brethren in
<pb facs="unknown:015082_0004_0F95AAAD72844040"/>
the Southern provinces, for whom he has the higheſt eſteem and affection, and would not for his right hand, ſpeak or write any thing that might give umbrage or juſt cauſe of offence to ſuch worthy patriots, ſo ardently engaged in the common cauſe, and uſing ſuch vigorous, ſpirited exertions for the defence and preſervation of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican liberty.—He is fully convinced of the abſolute importance of uniting in the moſt cordial friendſhip, as chriſtian brethren and fellow-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, in this glorious conteſt and ſtruggle, and fully ſenſible, that to give the ark a wrong touch in this critical moment, might be of unſpeakably dangerous conſequence—But, however, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends no hazard or danger of being miſguided by the ſcriptures of truth, which conſideration, amidſt all his diffidence, has prevailed with him to comply with the importunity of ſome of his friends, in conſenting to this publication. His earneſt wiſh and daily prayer is, that all differences and diſputes may terminate in the firmeſt union and harmony of thoſe colonies, and that liberty inviolate, may be ſecured to every individual of every denomination, ſo long as ſun and moon ſhall endure.</p>

               <q>
                  <hi>And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that ſhe might fly into the wilderneſs, into her place; where ſhe is nouriſhed for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the ſerpent. And the ſerpent caſt out of his mouth water as a flood, after the woman; that he might cauſe her to be carried away of the flood. And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and ſwallowed up the flood which the dragon caſt out of his mouth. And the dragon was worth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her ſeed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

            <p>THIS prophetic book is entitled, The Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, which he ſent and ſignified to his ſervant JOHN, by his angel; and which he received when in a ſtate of baniſhment, in the iſle called Patmos, for the word of God, and the teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt. It pleaſed the All-wiſe and Omniſcient God, to give to this his faithful ſervant, a very full and glorious viſion of the things which then were, or of the ſtate of the church at that time; and of the things which ſhould be hereafter, or the then future ſtate and condition of the church,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:015082_0006_0F95AAAF9FE65608"/>
the ſeaſons of its flouriſhing and proſperity, and of its declenſion; its trials and ſufferings to the end of the world. Which viſion he was ordered to write, for the inſtruction, ſupport, and conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of God's ſaints, in the wars and conflicts they might have with their enemies, in every age and period of time, till the old ſerpent, the great dragon ſhould be entirely overcome, and his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom compleatly deſtroyed. "And bleſſed is he that readeth, and they that hear the WORDS of this prophecy, and keep thoſe things which are written therein; for the time," that is, of their accompliſhment, "is at hand." The diligent and ſerious ſtudy of this ſacred book ought not to be neglected and deſpiſed, nor the things it contains be viewed as idle ſpeculations, and vain empty amuſements; but every man is bound in duty, to attend to the things contained herein, as to matters of great importance, with all the wiſdom, ſobriety and reverence he is capable of. It may with propriety be ſtiled, "The ſure word of prophecy." The apoſtle John was ſo highly favoured, as to behold a door opened in heaven; ſo near to which he was brought as to look in, and ſee the glorious things tranſacted there, to confirm his ſaith as to the truth of theſe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful predictions and prophecies to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed on earth. Chap. iv. 1. and the firſt voice which he heard, was as of a trumpet talking with him, which ſaid, "Come up hither, and I will ſhew thee things which muſt be hereafter." Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly God diſcovered to him all the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable events that ſhould befal his church, and the nations and kingdoms of the world, even to the cloſing period when the angel ſhould ſtand up and ſwear, that time ſhould be no more:
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:015082_0007_0F95AAB1452C3418"/>
Which things he was ordered to pen down in dark, emblematical, and figurative language, the meaning of which, tho' it cannot be fully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in the preſent dark ſtate of the church; yet may be ſo far underſtood as to afford much ſupport and encouragement to God's people in times of their greateſt diſtreſs and ſuffering, and tend to eſtabliſh their belief of the truth of this part of divine revelation, and of the ruling pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God which is conſtantly at work to fulfil and accompliſh the events herein predicted and foretold.</p>
            <p>WITH a view to aſſiſt us in forming juſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of the nature and deſign of theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies and predictions, and to lead us to a right improvement of ſuch providences of God by which they are fulfilled, I ſhall make two or three obſervations, before I proceed directly to explain the paſſages that have been read.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I WOULD obſerve with all judicious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators and expoſitors that have wrote on the ſubject, that Popery, or the reign and kingdom of the man of ſin, the old ſerpent, the dragon, its riſe and progreſs, and its downfal and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, is the greateſt, the moſt eſſential, and the moſt ſtriking part of this revelation of St. John. There has been a mortal enmity between the ſeed of the woman, and the ſeed of the ſerpent, ever ſince the fall of man, and the promiſe of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour for his recovery. The old ſerpent, who ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced man by his temptations, to fall, has ever been uſing his ſubtility and malice to defeat the purpoſes of divine grace, and to deſtroy Chriſt's kingdom on earth; and has, in all ages of the world, been ſucceſsful in ſtirring up agents and
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:015082_0008_0F95AAB1F9F134C8"/>
inſtruments to accompliſh this diabolical and hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh deſign. Among all his crafty and ſubtle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, popery, which exalts the principal lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and abettors of it, high in the honours and emoluments of this world, ſeems moſt cunningly deviſed, and beſt adapted to anſwer his purpoſe; and has proved the moſt formidable engine of terror and cruelty to the true members of Chriſt's church. And this has been the chief ſubject of prophecy ſince the coming of Chriſt; and was foretold by ſome of the prophets under the Jewiſh diſpenſation. And whatever difficulty and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity there may be in many of theſe dark, myſterious paſſages, yet in this view, the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of moſt of them is rendered eaſy and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious. As popery has been the greateſt enemy, and the greateſt corrupter of chriſtianity, we may rationally conclude that more prophecies relate to that, than to any other diſtant event.</p>
            <p>BY carefully reading and ſtudying the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies given forth by Daniel, by St. Paul, and more fully by St. John, it will appear to be clearly and evidently foretold, that ſuch a power as that of the Pope of Rome ſhould be exerciſed in the Chriſtian church, and ſhould authoriſe and eſtabliſh ſuch doctrines and practices as are pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly taught and embraced by the wicked, corrupt members of that mother of harlots and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. The time alſo is ſignified when, and how long it ſhould prevail; and that at laſt, upon the expiration of this term, it ſhould be deſtroyed forevermore.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THIS popiſh myſterious leaven of iniquity and abſurdity, by which the Chriſtian religion has been ſo awfully adulterated and corrupted, has
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:015082_0009_0F95AAB2DD88F190"/>
not been confined to the boundaries of the Roman empire, nor ſtrictly to the territory of the Pope's uſurped authority and juriſdiction; but has ſpread in a greater or leſs degree, among almoſt all the nations of the earth; eſpecially amongſt the chief rulers, the princes and noblemen thereof. When this great whore of Babylon, or papal Rome is deſcribed, Rev. xvii. 1. her bewitching, infatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating enchantments are ſaid to be ſuch, that the kings of the earth have been enticed, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed in their wicked luſts, to that degree as to have committed fornication with her; and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication or whoredom. They have been ſo far corrupted and debauched by this mother of harlots, as to ſacrifice every dictate of religion and reaſon, and even common ſenſe, to thoſe alluring arts with which ſhe has been tempting them. The prophet Iſaiah had long before this, foretold, "That ſhe ſhould turn to her hire, and commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the world, upon the face of the earth." Iſaiah xxiii. 17.</p>
            <p>WHEN the great red dragon, deſcribed, Revel. xii. having ſeven heads, and ten horns, and ſeven crowns upon his heads, made his firſt public ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, his tail drew a third part of the ſtars of Heaven, and did caſt them to the earth. The apoſtle, under theſe ſymbolical characters and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of the great red dragon, undoubtedly meant to point our Satan or the Devil with his agents and inſtruments, who are acting the part of avowed enemies to the church of Chriſt; and his drawing the ſtars of Heaven with his tail, muſt mean his ſubjecting the princes and potentates of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:015082_0010_0F95AAB3791F9C88"/>
the earth, with great numbers of the clergy, to his tyrannical influence and oppreſſive ſcheme of government. The prophets often deſcribe the perſecuting enemies of the church, under this emblem and figure. Pſalm lxxiv. 13. "Thou breakeſt the heads of the dragons in the waters, &amp;c." And when God comes to deſtroy theſe ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, he is ſaid "to cut Rahab, and to wound the dragon," Iſaiah li. 9. ſee alſo Ezekial xxix. 3. "Thus ſaith the Lord God, behold, I am againſt thee Pharaoh, king of Egypt, the great dragon that lieth in the midſt of his rivers, which hath ſaid, my river is mine own, and I have made it for myſelf." When the frightful monſter of a beaſt, in ſuch terrible array, is deſcribed, Rev. xiii. The dragon is ſaid to give him his power, and his ſeat, and great authority; and all the world wondered after the beaſt; and ſaid, "Who is like unto the beaſt? Who is able to make war with the beaſt?" Which expreſſions denote the great extent of his power and dominion, as well as the blind infatuation of his deluded ſubjects who made their boaſt of it. It is added, "And power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations, and all that dwell upon the earth, ſhall worſhip him, whoſe names are not written in the book of life, of the Lamb ſlain from the foundation of the world." Now, it can admit of no doubt, but that there are multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of this character in other nations and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, beſides papal Rome. This is further evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from chap. xiv. 8. when the angel comes to proclaim the fall of Babylon, the reaſon given why God thus proceeded in righteous vengeance and wrath, is this, <abbr>viz.</abbr> "Becauſe ſhe made all
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:015082_0011_0F95AAB5228182E8"/>
nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication." Her's was a kind of Circean cup, as one obſerves, with poiſoned liquor, to intoxicate and inflame mankind to ſpiritual fornication. The prophet Jeremiah hath aſſigned much the ſame reaſon for her deſtruction, chap. li. 7. "Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon hath been a golden cup in the Lord's hand, that made all the earth drunk; the nations hath drunken of her wine, therefore the nations are mad." When the ſixth angel poured out his vial, Rev. xvi. Three unclean ſpirits like frogs, are ſaid to come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beaſt, and out of the mouth of the falſe prophet, which are ſaid to be ſpirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth, and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of the great day of God Almighty. Theſe unclean ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits here compared to frogs, a very low-lived, inferior kind of animals, who are peeping and croaking in the dark holes and corners of the earth, moſt probably repreſent popiſh, Jeſuitical miſſioners, or the tools and emiſſaries in general, of anit-chriſtian, tyrannical power, who are the ſpirits of devils, and have free acceſs to the kings of the earth, and are ſaid to be gone forth through the whole world, and are induſtriouſly uſing all their moſt artful ſtratagems, and diabolical craft and ſubtility, to impoſe upon mankind, and to engage them in the ſupport and defence of the kingdom of Satan, in oppoſition to the mighty hoſt marſhalled up by the Lord Almighty, for the overthrow and deſtruction thereof. Theſe ſcripture prophecies and predictions that have now been cited, to which more might be added, were
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:015082_0012_0F95AAB5D2D99790"/>
it neceſſary, make it abundantly evident and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that the anti-chriſtian, tyrannical ſcheme of popery, in one ſhape and form, and another, was to have a very extenſive ſpread and influence, not only thro' the territories of papal Rome, but thro' all the nations and kingdoms of the world in general, and that the kings and princes of the earth, as well as their ſubjects, were to be much intoxicated and infatuated therewith; to the great diſtreſs and perplexity of the true chuch of Chriſt, which, ſo far as I have been able to obſerve, has not been ſuitably noticed and attended to by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitors and divines that have wrote on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; the want of which has occaſioned much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity and obſcurity in their comments on ſome paſſages, which, in the right view of them, are full of ſignificance and importance. For inſtance, that paſſage in the xiii. chap. of this myſterious book, where the image of the beaſt is ſpoken of, "I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs," ſays a great expoſitor, "I know not what the image of the beaſt is, diſtinct from the beaſt itſelf." The reaſon of which was, no doubt, his limiting and confining theſe prophecies to ſo narrow a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, as papal Rome. Every man of common ſenſe, knows that the image of a thing is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing different from the thing itſelf. Therefore, to make ſenſe of the language here uſed, we muſt ſuppoſe that the apoſtle intended to deſcribe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſecuting tyrannical power, in ſome nation or kingdom of the world, which was a lively figure and reſemblance of that exerciſed at Rome, the head-quarters of tyranny and perſecution<note n="*" place="bottom">See the appendix.</note>. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that perſecuting power be intended, that has in years paſt, been ſo cruelly and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly

exerciſed in France, and other popiſh coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, againſt the humble followers of Chriſt, to the maſſacre and deſtruction of ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of proteſtants<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>In the war with the Albigenſes and Waldenſes, there were deſtroyed of them, in France alone, one million,</p>
                  <p>From the firſt inſtitution of the JESUITS, to the year 1450, that is, in little more than thirty years, nine hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand orthodox Chriſtians, were ſlain. In the Netherlands alone, the Duke of ALVA boaſted, that within a few years, he had diſpatched to the amount of thirty ſix thouſand ſouls; and thoſe all by the hand of the common executioner. In the ſpace of ſcarce thirty years, the INQUISITION deſtroyed, by various kinds of torments, a hundred and fifty thouſand chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Beſides theſe, an innumerable multitude have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted to death, throughout all Europe, by the cruel hand of tyranny and perſecution. As to the number that have been, and may yet be ſlain in America, in the war and conflict with the beaſt, and the image of the beaſt, it cannot yet be aſcertained.</p>
               </note>; or whether there be a refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the corrupt ſyſtem of tyranny and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that has of late been fabricated and adopted by the miniſtry and parliament of Great-Britain, which appears ſo favourable to popery and the Roman catholic intereſt, aiming at the extenſion and eſtabliſhment of it, and ſo awfully threatens the civil and religious liberties of all ſound pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants; I cannot poſitively determine. But ſince the propheſies repreſent this wicked ſcheme of anti-chriſtian tyranny, as having ſuch an extenſive and univerſal ſpread over the earth, like Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar's tree which reached unto heaven, and the light thereof to all the ends of the earth, it need not appear ſtrange or ſhocking to us, to find that our own nation has been, in ſome degree, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected and corrupted therewith, and that ſome of our princes and chief rulers have had a criminal converſe and familiarity with the old mother of harlots; and been ſipping of the golden cup of
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:015082_0014_0F95AAB833146A80"/>
her fornication, ſo as to be intoxicated, if not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drunk with her poiſonous liquors. Before what is called the reformation, the man of ſin reigned triumphant in our mother-country, without much check or controul; which reformation was not ſet on foot on the pureſt principles of genuine chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, nor carried to perfection by King HENRY the Eighth, who is ſo celebrated as the author of it. In the reign of Queen MARY, the doctrine and ceremonies of the catholic religion were re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, and the Pope's authority and juriſdiction acknowledged in full; and a very cruel, ſevere perſecution rigorouſly carried on againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, conſcientious profeſſors of the proteſtant religion; and a moſt tragical ſcene of bloodſhed and ſlaughter exhibited, as ever England beheld.</p>
            <p>IF we paſs from this dark and bloody period of Engliſh hiſtory, and come down to the reign of the STUART family, we ſhall find three or four of our kings ſucceſſively, ſeduced and infatuated by the enticing and bewitching inchantments of the old whore of Babylon, to that degree, as to drink deep of the intoxicating wine of her fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the entire deſtruction of two of them; and to the great diſtreſs of the nation in general. How far the preſent miniſtry have walked in this enchanting road, and how fond they are of the kind embraces of this old filthy harlot, the world will judge from their open attempts to propagate and eſtabliſh popery, that exotic plant, in theſe northern regions; which is not a native of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign ſoil, nor of our heavenly Father's planting; and their gathering up of armies profeſſedly Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man catholics to dragoon us into ſlavery and bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, or maſſacre and butcher us and our fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,

and lay our pleaſant country in deſolation and ruin.</p>
            <p n="3">3. SINCE theſe prophecies and predictions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the trials and ſufferings, the wars and conflicts of the church with her anti-chriſtian enemies and adverſaries, may be juſtly taken in ſuch a large, extenſive ſenſe and latitude; we may rationally conclude that many of them have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the ſtate of Chriſt's church, in this American quarter of the globe; and will ſooner or later, have their fulfilment and accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment among us. The providences of God in firſt planting his church in this, then howling wilderneſs, and in delivering and preſerving of it to this day, are in a manner unequalled, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velous; and are reckoned among the moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous events that are to be found in hiſtory, in theſe latter ages of the world. And there are doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs yet more glorious events in the womb of providence, which the preſent commotion thro' the nation and land may (however unlikely in the view of ſome) be the means of bringing to paſs. There is no part of this terraqueous globe better fitted and furniſhed in all eſſential articles and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, to make a great and flouriſhing empire; no part of the earth, where learning, religion, and liberty have flouriſhed more for the time. And as to the rapid increaſe of its inhabitants, and ſwift population, it cannot be paralleled in all hiſtory. There is no part of the world where its inhabitants, through ſuch a large extent of territory, are under ſuch bonds and obligations, from ſelf-intereſt, to keep in the ſtricteſt union and harmony together. They have every motive and inducement to this, that can well be conceived
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:015082_0016_0F95AABB3B39BA58"/>
of. And this union, by the bleſſing of Heaven, is become as general, perfect and complete, as could well be expected in ſuch a corrupt diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed world as this in which we live.</p>
            <p>THESE United Colonies have ariſen to ſuch a height as to become the object of public atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thro' all Europe, and of envy to the mother from whence they derived; whoſe unprovoked attack upon them in ſuch a furious hoſtile man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, threatening their entire ruin, is an event that will make ſuch a black and dark period in hiſtory, and does ſo deeply affect, not only the liberty of the church here in the wilderneſs, but the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant cauſe in general, thro' the chriſtian world, and is big with ſuch conſequences of glory or terror, that we may conjecture at leaſt, without a ſpirit of vanity and enthuſiaſm, that ſome of thoſe prophecies of St. John may, not unaptly, be applied to our caſe, and receive their fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in ſuch providences as are paſſing over us.</p>
            <p>I DO not mean to undertake a nice, exact cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of the periods pointed out in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetic book; nor to range thro' the hiſtory of the world for events to find their accompliſhment. I am of opinion, that the church of Chriſt in every age, may find ſomething in this book applicable to her caſe and circumſtances; and all ſuch paſſages that are ſo, may lawfully be applied and improved by us accordingly. There are many caſes which happen, that bear a near likeneſs and reſemblance to each other, and which the ſame prophecy may well ſuit, in the moſt material parts of it. It has pleaſed that God who exerciſes a univerſal providence over all things, ſo to diſpoſe and order events, that the calamities and afflictions
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:015082_0017_0F95AABCCFC049A0"/>
of the church, in ſome meaſure, run parallel one to another; and all the former efforts of that tyrannical perſecuting power, called the <hi>beaſt,</hi> may be the types and figures, as it were, of his laſt and general effort againſt the faithful witneſſes of Chriſt, and the true members of his church.</p>
            <p>THESE preliminary obſervations may aſſiſt us in explaining and improving theſe prophecies of St. John; particularly the paſſages that have been read, to the conſideration of which I now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
            <p>VERSE 14. "And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that ſhe might fly into the wilderneſs, into her place, where ſhe is nouriſhed for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the ſerpent."</p>
            <p>THE woman in this paſſage, is repreſented in verſe 2. as in a pregnant ſtate, travailing in birth, and in violent pangs to be delivered, which is doubtleſs deſigned as an emblem of the true church of Chriſt. She is elſewhere ſpoken of as the ſpouſe of Chriſt, who owns himſelf to be her head and huſband. A woman, we know, is the weaker ſex, and looks to her huſband for ſupport and protection. So the church has always been the weakeſt part of the world, in herſelf conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and had her dependence on Chriſt her head, for preſervation and ſafety in times of peril and danger. This woman, the church, being in ſuch a near relation to Chriſt, the brightneſs of the Father's glory, and expreſs image of his perſon, amidſt all her own natural weakneſs and infirmity, has never appeared contemptible; but the moſt glorious ſociety that ever exiſted in our world. She is the king's daughter, <hi>all glorious within.</hi> She
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:015082_0018_0F95AABE6D86F3F8"/>
is ſpoken of, verſe 1. as being cloathed with the ſun, and having the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve ſtars; which is a magnificent deſcription of her comelineſs, beauty and luſtre. She is enlightened, inveſted and adorned with the rays of Jeſus Chriſt, the great Sun of righteouſneſs, which makes her form illuſtriouſly bright and majeſtic. She is in ſuch a ſtate of dignity and triumph, as to have the moon, with all ſublunary enjoyments and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, under her feet. And on her head, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat her glory, a crown of twelve ſtars, an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem of her being under the light and guidance of the twelve inſpired apoſtles, who had been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved as maſter-builders under Chriſt, in laying the foundation of this honourable ſociety, and were ſuch uſeful and diſtinguiſhing ornaments to it. One would think that ſuch a ſociety as this, would have nothing to fear from all the combined powers of earth and hell; and indeed, they have not in reality, ſince ſtronger is he that is for them, than thoſe that are againſt them. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, they are not exempted from trials and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings in this world. We find, when the great red dragon appeared with his ſeven heads and ten horns, that frightful monſter the devil inſtigated the tyrannical perſecuting powers of the earth, againſt this harmleſs and innocent woman, the amiable ſpouſe of Chriſt. He had impudence and boldneſs enough to make an unprovoked at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack upon her, which occaſioned her to leave the imperial and wealthy abodes of earthly grandeur and magnificence, the courts and palaces of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors and princes, and retired to ſome obſcure, ſolitary condition, for the ſweets of liberty and
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:015082_0019_0F95AABED5C80108"/>
peace. This furious attack of the great dragon on the woman, was an event of ſuch importance, as to produce war in Heaven between the angels of light, and the angels of darkneſs. See verſe 7. "Michael and his angels fought againſt the dragon; and the dragon fought, and his angels." This Michael was the tutelar angel and protector of the Jewiſh church. Daniel x. 12. And he performs here the ſame office of champion for the Chriſtian church.</p>
            <p>He, and the good angels who are ſent forth to miniſter to the heirs of ſalvation, were the inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble agents on one ſide, as the devil and his evil angels were on the other. The viſible actors in the cauſe of chriſtianity, were believers, whether in a civil or eccleſiaſtical character, with the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious martyrs and confeſſors. And in ſupport of the oppoſite ſide, were the perſecuting powers of the world, with the whole dark train of the artillery of hell. In this great conflict and war, let it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to what period of the church it will, which I am not anxious to determine with mathematical certainty; we find that thoſe on the ſide of God and true religion, overcame their formidable ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, with all his confederate powers, by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their teſtimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death. They were of ſuch a brave, heroic ſpirit, as to cheerfully expoſe themſelves to the greateſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in this glorious cauſe; and many of them actually met death in the terrible conflict. But they fell, as one obſerves, to riſe, and triumph, and reign. The dragon being thus defeated and vanquiſhed at his head-quarters, pagan or papal Rome: He takes a wider ſcope and range, thro'
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:015082_0020_0F95AABF7A3D2E00"/>
the other nations and kingdoms of the earth. He was doubtleſs greatly enraged at the ill ſucceſs of his firſt encounter, and marſhals up all his forces abroad, and proceeds with violence, to perſecute the woman which brought forth the man-child. Upon this the woman has a ſecond flight into a more diſtant and ſolitary wilderneſs, "unto her place;" to prepare her for which, two wings of a great eagle were given her, which is not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in her firſt flight; and probably ſhe did not then need them. There ſeems an evident al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion here, to what God ſaid to the children of Iſrael, Exod. xix. 4. after their deliverance from cruel oppreſſive ſlavery in Egypt, when encamp'd before Sinai, and on their way to the good land of Canaan, "Ye have ſeen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles wings, and brought you unto myſelf." He was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting them from a land of liberty, peace, and tranquillity, into a ſtate of bondage, perſecution and diſtreſs; but on the contrary, had wrought out a very glorious deliverance for them, and ſet them free from the cruel hand of tyranny and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, by executing his judgments in a moſt terrible and awful manner, on the Egyptians, their enemies; and was now, by his kind provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, leading them to the good land of Canaan, which he gave them by promiſe, for an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inheritance. Hence, as the trials and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Chriſtian church were parallel in ſome meaſure, with thoſe of the Jewiſh, and there is a great ſimilarity and likeneſs in the manner of God's dealings with the one to the other; it muſt be evident, that expoſitors have been miſtaken, when they repreſent this flight of the woman into
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:015082_0021_0F95AAC041B466C0"/>
the wilderneſs, as denoting the church's going into greater peril, danger and affliction, where ſhe was to be more violently diſtreſſed and perſecuted, for a long time. The word WILDERNESS might poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ſuggeſt to their delicate, but inattentive minds, this frightful and ſhocking idea. It is true, our fathers had the difficulties of an uncul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated wilderneſs to encounter; but it ſoon, by the bleſſing of Heaven on their labour and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, became a pleaſant field or garden, and has been made to bloſſom like the roſe. The paſſage, in its moſt natural, genuine conſtruction, contains as full and abſolute a promiſe of this land, to the Chriſtian church, as ever was made to the Jewiſh, of the land of Canaan. It is, in an appropriated ſenſe, "her place;" where ſhe is nouriſhed, from the face of the ſerpent. And the dealings of God in his providence, in bringing his church from a ſtate of oppreſſion and perſecution, into this good land, are very parallel and ſimilar to his dealings with the Iſraelites, in delivering them from the tyrannical power of the haughty, cruel monarch of Egypt, and conducting them to the good land of promiſe in Canaan. Thus, they that wait on the Lord, ſhall renew their ſtrength; they ſhall mount up with wings, as eagles; they ſhall run, and not be weary, they ſhall walk and not faint.</p>
            <p>THUS the church, in this difficult, diſtreſſed ſeaſon, whenever it happened, was ſupported and carried, as it were, on eagles wings, to a diſtant remote wilderneſs, for ſafety and protection. And what period or event is there in all the hiſtory of her trials and perſecutions, which theſe expreſſions more exactly deſcribe, and to which they can be
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:015082_0022_0F95AAC1431C7A70"/>
applied with more truth and propriety, than to the flight of our fore-fathers into this then howling wilderneſs, which was a land not ſown nor occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied by any ruling power on earth, except by ſavages and wild beaſts? It is an indiſputable fact, that the cruel hand of oppreſſion, tyranny and perſecution drove them out from their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant ſeats and habitations, in the land of their nativity; and that the pureſt principles of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and liberty, led them to make the bold adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture acroſs the wide Atlantic ocean; for which they ſurely needed the two wings of the great eagle, to ſpeed their flight, and to ſhelter and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them from danger, while ſeeking a ſafe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat from the relentleſs fury and ſhocking cruelty of the perſecuting dragon; and a ſecure abode for unadulterated chriſtianity, liberty and peace. It is remarked by the inſpired penman of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, and is worthy of notice, that when the woman fled into the wilderneſs, ſhe came INTO HER PLACE. This American quarter of the globe ſeemed to be reſerved in providence, as a fixed and ſettled habitation for God's church, where ſhe might have property of her own, and the right of rule and government, ſo as not to be controul'd and oppreſs'd in her civil and religious liberties, by the tyrannical and perſecuting pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the earth, repreſented by the great red dragon. The church never before this, had <hi>prime occupancy,</hi> or firſt poſſeſſion of any part of this terraqueous globe, in any great extent of territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. In all countries and kingdoms wherever Chriſtianity had been planted, before its intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction into this American wilderneſs, the ruling powers in poſſeſſion of the property, and right
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:015082_0023_0F95AAC1C700BD68"/>
of juriſdiction and dominion, were in oppoſition to this benevolent inſtitution; and the church had to make her way through the greateſt poſſible dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties and dangers. While thus in an enemy's land, her perſecutions and oppreſſions, her bloody trials and ſufferings furniſh out the chief ſubject of her hiſtory from her beginning to the preſent day, in other parts of the world, from which ſhe is not wholly exempted in this. However, her degree of peace and quiet reſt has been greater than ſhe has ever known ſince ſhe has had exiſtance and being. When that God, to whom the earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, and the fulneſs thereof, brought his church into this wilderneſs, as on eagles wings, by his kind, protecting providence, he gave this good land to her, to be her own lot and inheritance for ever. He planted her as a pleaſant and choice vine; and drove out the Heathen before her. He has tenderly nouriſhed and cheriſhed her in her infant ſtate, and protected and preſerved her amidſt innumerable dangers. He has done won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in his providence for our fathers; and for us their ſinful poſterity: They, and we have many a time, ſtood ſtill, and ſeen the ſalvation of the Lord. The woman, the church of Chriſt, has ſuch a gift and grant from Heaven, of this part of God's world, for the quiet enjoyment of her liberties and privileges, civil and religious, that no power on earth can have any right to invade, much leſs to diſpoſſeſs her of them. And every attempt of this kind to oppreſs and enſlave her; muſt be abſolutely unrighteous, and a groſs viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of juſtice and truth. He that has all power in heaven and on earth, who will ſoon deſtroy
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:015082_0024_0F95AAC51C5109E8"/>
the man of ſin, and all his confederate powers, by the ſpirit of his mouth, and brightneſs of his coming, declares in this prophecy, that the "wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man" ſhall be nouriſhed and preſerved in her place here deſcribed, "from the face of the ſerpent." The ſerpent ſpoken of, is the great dragon, called the Devil and Satan; the chief directing agent in all the dark plots of tyranny, perſecution and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; from whoſe malignant rage, the church has a promiſe of future protection. This old ſerpent ſhall never be permitted to ſhew his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed face, much leſs to lift up his monſtrous head, and frightful horns in this place here given to the woman for a ſafe retreat and ſecure abode, "for a time, and times, and half a time;" which probably means, "to the end of the world," or till all the times and periods ſpoken of in this prophetic book are fulfilled and accompliſhed. I know that expoſitors take theſe expreſſions, "for a time, and times, and half a time," to include only the period of one thouſand two hundred and ſixty days, mentioned verſe 6, and ſo underſtood the phraſe "for a time," to mean one propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal year, and "times," to mean two years, and "half a time," an half year; in the whole, three years and a half: But it ſeems more natural, and more agreeable to the phraſeology of ſcripture, as well as the connection of theſe prophecies, in the events foretold, to interpret this paſſage as ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying all future time indefinitely. Or, if we apply it to diſtinct periods, the firſt expreſſion, "for a time," I ſhould think, might, with great propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, be taken for the time or period, that hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready been mentioned. This conſtruction appears natural, and not in the leaſt forced or ſtrained.
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:015082_0025_0F95AAC840FFA168"/>
Then the "times" will mean ſuch times or periods as follow after the fulfilment of the above; and the "half time," muſt ſignify the cloſing period, when time is near run out, and juſt come to an end. Taking the paſſage in its proper connection, and plaineſt and moſt obvious ſenſe, we may well underſtand it as containing a prophetic promiſe to the church, of ſafety and preſervation, during the period that had been deſcribed above, and thro' all ſucceeding times, even to the end of the world. Not but what the old dragon, with his black train of tyrannical perſecuting powers, might greatly afflict and diſtreſs her: Yet, with all his cunning, art, policy and power, ſhall never be able to eſtabliſh his enſlaving doctrines, nor to erect his head and horns, to exerciſe his uſurped authority and uncontrouled dominion, as in papal Rome. We may expect, however, that he will be putting forth moſt violent ſtruggles and efforts for this baſe, malignant purpoſe.</p>
            <p>ONE objection of weight, I have againſt the current opinion of expoſitors, who interpret the paſſage, "a time, and times, and half a time," to ſignify the ſame period as the thouſand two hundred and three-ſcore days, is, that this is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable to the ſacred writer, and ſhews that he rather meant to puzzle and perplex his readers, than to enlighten and inſtruct them. I believe that all will allow, that the language uſed in the 6th verſe, is more plain and intelligible, and has a more fixed and determinate meaning, than that in the 14th verſe. Now, to ſuppoſe the ſame period of time, is deſcribed in the one, as in the other, is to ſuppoſe, that the Apoſtle, after he
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:015082_0026_0F95AAC8A3167BA0"/>
had deſcribed a thing in a plain, eaſy way to be underſtood, proceeds on to involve the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in a cloud of myſticiſm, darkneſs and obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which could not tend, very much, to the improvement and edification of Chriſt's church. It is uſual with all good writers, as they advance on their ſubject, to elucidate and illuſtrate their meaning more and more, to ſet it in a plainer and more intelligible point of light. And this is, eſpecially, the tone of all inſpired writers, and of St. John in particular. The light of revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is like the path of the juſt, ſhining brighter and brighter in every page, till we come to the cloſe of it.</p>
            <p>BUT ſhould my explanation of this paſſage, after all, be diſputed, and the time, times, and half time, allowed to include no more, altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than the period of twelve hundred and ſixty years, which I have taken to be included in that expreſſion only, "a time," yet it will not mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially affect my ſcheme. For, on the old plan of expoſition, it is ſuppoſed, that after the expira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe twelve hundred and ſixty years, the trials and ſufferings of the church will be chiefly over; and that a ſcene of great peace, proſperity and happineſs will open and commence. Hence, if the prophetic promiſe in the text, extends no further than to that happy and bleſſed period, the church will ſafely get through the long ſtorm and tempeſt, raiſed by the dragon; and ſo, be ready for a ſhare in the bleſſings of that glorious and happy period to ſucceed; during which, we need not be very anxious about her ſafety, conſidering other precious promiſes that are made in her favour.</p>

THE ſerpent is ſaid, verſe 15, "to caſt out of his mouth, water, as a flood, after the woman, that he might cauſe her to be carried away of the flood." This, perhaps, is one of the artifices, ſays a learned expoſitor, which theſe enormous creatures make uſe of, "to beat down their prey," when flying from them. The common ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a flood is an inundation of water, &amp;c. The Pſalmiſt ſets forth extreme dangers, under the notion of a flood. Pſalm lxix. 15. "Let not the water-flood overflow me." And the violent aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults, and ſubtle temptations, and ſudden incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Devil and his inſtruments againſt the church, are compared to a flood, Iſaiah lix. 19. "When the enemy ſhall come in like a flood, the ſpirit of the Lord ſhall lift up a ſtandard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him." Which prophecy may refer to, and have its accompliſhments in the preſent ſtate of the church, about which we are treating. The oppreſſive and perſecuting power here figuratively deſcribed, under the emblem of the ſerpent, which occaſioned the flight of the woman, the church, into this wilderneſs, whenever it has prevailed, has been full of the moſt inveterate malice and envy againſt her; and uſed every art and ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem to extirpate and deſtroy her from the earth. Hence, the flood which the ſerpent caſt out of his mouth after the woman, may very naturally and properly be interpreted to ſignify all the ſubtle temptations, artful ſchemes, and machinations of our enemies and adverſaries, to enſnare and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt us, and to deſtroy our liberties and privileges, that we might be embarraſſed again under the old tyrant, the dragon, and patiently ſubmit to the iron yoke, and galling chains of cruel oppreſſion
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:015082_0028_0F95AACB9A890F70"/>
and bondage; which machinations and contriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances have been too many to be enumerated in a ſhort, conciſe diſcourſe. Every one acquainted with the hiſtory of our country, of the New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land colonies in particular, muſt know, that there have been floods iſſued from the mouth of the old ſerpent, after the woman, to effect her deſtruction and overthrow. Whenever a ſpirit of deſpotiſm has run high, and a luſting ambition after arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry power and lawleſs dominion has prevailed; when the dragon dare venture to put on and wear his long horns; the woman in the wilderneſs has felt the grievous diſtreſſing effects. At ſuch ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, jeſuitical emiſſaries, the tools of tyrannical power, have been employed to corrupt her doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, and lead her into the belief of the darling doctrines of arbitrary <hi>power, paſſive obedience and non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtance;</hi> who, like the frogs that iſſued out of the mouth of the falſe prophet, who are ſaid to have the ſpirit of devils, have been ſlyly creeping into all the holes and corners of the land, and uſing their enchanting art and bewitching policy, to lead aſide, the ſimple and unwary, from the truth, to prepare them for the ſhackles of ſlavery and bondage. Thouſands and millions of money, have, at one time and another, been expended for the purpoſes of bribery and corruption, to accompliſh this malignant deſign. Evil, wicked men have been entruſted with the chief command in one province and another, where the door has been open, to act as tools of a corrupt admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration and tyrannical power, in forwarding and ripening their deep-laid ſchemes, for the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the woman. The colonies in America will not ſoon forget the cruel and tyrannical admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:015082_0029_0F95AACC68ABC228"/>
of Sir Edmond Androſs, at Boſton, and his evil deſigns againſt them in general; and Lord Cornbury, at New-York; the late inſidious and traiterous conduct of Bernard and Hutchinſon, is ſtill more freſh in every one's mind; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of Gage, Carlton, and Dunmore, who, by their baſe, perfidious and cruel behaviour, have rendered themſelves univerſally odious and deteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the American colonies. In theſe and ſuch like ways, not to mention the unrighteous ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes reſtricting and interdicting our trade and commerce, the ſtamp-act, &amp;c. we have had floods poured forth from the mouth of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, which at length, have brought on a civil war. The dragon finding his artful temptations on the one hand, and his cruel menaces and threatenings on the other, ineffectual to gain the woman to a compliance with his terms, has at length become wroth with her, and brought over his troops and armies to make war with the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of her ſeed. But, bleſſed be God! all his efforts and ſtruggles have hitherto been unſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; for the earth helped the woman. Verſe 16. "And the earth opened her mouth, and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up the flood which the dragon caſt out of his mouth."</p>
            <p>IF this is taken in the literal ſenſe, to ſignify that groſs terreſtrial element which ſuſtains and nouriſhes us, it is ſtrictly true; in which ſenſe ſome of the prophecies have been, and yet will, no doubt, be accompliſhed. The earth has ever helped the woman ſince her arrival to theſe ſhores, with every article neceſſary to her comfortable ſupport. She has never wanted for nouriſhing food, and good raiment; has never known the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:015082_0030_0F95AACCF7A32230"/>
diſtreſſes ariſing from ſcarcity of bread, pinching hunger and famine; has always, from the firſt ſettlement and cultivation of the country, had things convenient for her, and, as I truſt, been contented with her lot and condition. The earth has, in a very remarkable manner, thro' the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Heaven, been profuſe and liberal in her precious fruits and productions, the year paſt, when the dragon has been wroth with the woman, and uſing all poſſible ſchemes and contrivances to diſtreſs her, and ſtarve her into a compliance to his deſpotic and arbitrary rule, by ſhutting up her ports and harbours, and interdicting her trade and commerce, and cutting her off from all ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies from her fiſhery, a very uſeful and neceſſary branch of her trade and livelihood, by which thouſands were maintained. I ſay, when the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man has, in theſe, and in ſuch like ways, been diſtreſſed, ſhe has been helped in a very extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way, by the earth. Our crops of all kinds have been plentiful. Our fruit-trees loaded with fruit, and preſſed down with their burdens. Our granaries are full. There is ſuch an uncommon plenty of all kinds of good proviſions for man and beaſt, that ſome inconſiderate perſons are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to eſteem it rather a curſe, than a bleſſing; as we know not how to diſpenſe with, or diſpoſe of it. But not to enlarge here.</p>
            <p>SHOULD we take the expreſſion in a figurative ſenſe, to mean the men of the earth, and earthly powers, it may ſtill, with truth and propriety be applied to our preſent caſe. For as the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive meaſures purſued by the Britiſh parliament, ſtrike at our temporal intereſt and property, as well as our civil and religious privileges, it will
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:015082_0031_0F95AACDC68C9AF0"/>
engage thoſe of an earthly temper to exert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the preſent ſtruggles; by which means the earth helpeth the woman. And beſides, the vaſt advantage of theſe American plantations, in point of traffic and merchandiſe, to all ſuch as trade in ſhips, will doubtleſs, if the preſent ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem is purſued, engage the kingdoms of the world, and the merchants of the earth, to eſpouſe the cauſe of the colonies, to ſuch purpoſes as will, in their operation, greatly help the woman againſt the flood caſt out of the dragon's mouth.</p>
            <p>AND not only the earth, but the God that made it, nouriſheth the woman in the wilderneſs, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt the moſt violent and cruel attempts of a tyrannical and perſecuting power, and has raiſed up perſons of a martial, heroic ſpirit, and endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with ſkill, courage and fortitude, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and protect his church. The flood of the dragon that has been poured forth to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, in the Quebec bill, for the eſtabliſhment of popery, and other engines and inſtruments that have been ſet to work, to bring the ſavages down upon us, to our utter deſtruction, have been chiefly ſwallowed up by our late ſucceſsful enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes againſt them; and the woman has received a great addition of ſtrength from this quarter, as a door is opened for breaking up the ſeat of the dragon in Canada; and for bringing in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then tribes, perhaps, the fulneſs of the Gentiles, into firm league and friendſhip with her, for her future defence and protection. So that inſtead of being carried away with this flood, ſhe ſtands on more firm ground, and is better eſtabliſhed than ever. Should we extend the meaning of the phraſe, ſo as to take in other neighbouring powers
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:015082_0032_0F95AACE97DAA4C8"/>
of the earth, they have likewiſe helped the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in her diſtreſſes and troubles, by affording a competent ſupply of military inſtruments and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ſtores for her defence and protection; when all poſſible precaution had been uſed by her ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, to deprive her of theſe uſeful articles, ſo neceſſary for ſelf-preſervation; and theſe other powers ſeem ſo friendly diſpoſed, that it is highly probable, ſhould the ſerpent continue to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute and diſtreſs the woman, that they will ſoon open their mouth, and ſwallow up the whole flood, even all the fleets and armies which the dragon may caſt out of his mouth.</p>
            <p>THE probability or conjecture of neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nations continuing to help the woman, the church, to that degree, as to ſwallow up all the floods, the ſerpent may caſt out of his mouth after her, is founded, not only on their preſent friendly appearance, and the part which their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted views may lead them to take in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent controverſy, but on the ſure word of prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. See Rev. xvii. 16, 17. "And the ten horns which thou ſaweſt upon the beaſt, theſe ſhall hate the whore; and ſhall make her deſolate and naked; and ſhall eat her fleſh, and burn her with fire. For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will." Theſe ten horns, doubtleſs mean ſome of the kingdoms and princes of the earth, that have, for a long time, been under the influence of the beaſt, the great whore of Babylon, and had a great ſhare with her, in the cruel and bloody work of tyranny, perſecution and oppreſſion. But the time is coming, and perhaps near at hand, when their league and friendſhip with her, will be diſſolved and broken; and their love turned
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:015082_0033_0F95AACF346EC290"/>
into hatred and a ſpirit of revenge. They will turn with warm zeal and violence againſt her; and uſe all their ſtrength and power for her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and overthrow. Theſe ſhall hate the whore to a degree beyond what they ever loved her, and ſhall make her deſolate and naked. They ſhall ſtrip her of all her coſtly ornaments which they have laviſhed away upon her, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually humble her inſolence and pride, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe her to public ſhame and diſgrace; in the heat of their indignation and zeal, ſhall eat her very fleſh, and burn her with fire. They will do the moſt thorough execution upon this old harlot, by whom they had been ſo long infatuated and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; and wholly break up the ſtupid ſchemes of idolatry, with all the monuments of it, and bring the abettors and inſtruments of tyranny and perſecution to their condign puniſhment. This God will put into their hearts, by a ſtrong and powerful impreſſion, to fulfil his will; and they ſhall agree in it, to perform his purpoſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. This prediction or prophecy, it is thought by judicious expoſitors, refers to the deſtruction of papal Rome, or to the demoliſhing of the Popiſh hierarchy in general; and that the kings of France are pointed out, as the principal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments to effect it. They have, in years paſt, contributed greatly to her growth and advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and done much at the cruel work of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution. It is not impoſſible, nor improbable, that the time is coming, when their hearts will be turned againſt her, and be improved by Heaven, as the principal authors of her overthrow and ruin. France has been ſatiated with the blood of Proteſtants, and 'tis to be hoped, will never thirſt
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:015082_0034_0F95AAD2D0345C78"/>
after it any more. She has already ſhewn ſome tendency towards a reformation; and therefore may be judged very likely to effect ſuch a revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It appears from verſe 17, that the infatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of Popiſh princes will be permitted by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine providence, only for a certain limited period, till the words of God be fulfilled. And then their minds ſhall be turned and their eyes opened; and they ſhall ruin and deſtroy all oppreſſive, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical combinations, more eagerly than they eſtabliſhed them. Should our honourable Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental CONGRESS, ſee fit, in their great wiſdom, at this difficult juncture, to open a free trade, and correſpond with that nation, in a way in which our threatened rights and liberties might have ſuch ſecurity and indemnification, as to be in no hazard or danger of any future encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on them, the ſpirit of liberty might ſpread and circulate with commerce; and from ſmall ſparks, kindle up into a bright and inextinguiſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble flame, in that, and in other kingdoms of the earth; and ſo haſten the fulfilment of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, in the entire deſtruction of the beaſt, or man of ſin, and in the complete and glorious ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of God's afflicted church.</p>
            <p>THE dragon, in this ſituation, is repreſented as much embarraſſed in his black ſyſtem of politics, in a ſtate of great perplexity, and high paroxiſm of paſſion. Verſe 17. "He was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her ſeed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt." Which may refer to the preſent war that is carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on with ſuch heat and fury againſt us; which ſeems chiefly levelled againſt thoſe who moſt
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:015082_0035_0F95AAD46F2A7680"/>
ſtrictly and conſcientiouſly adhere to the pure, uncorrupted doctrine and worſhip of our pious forefathers; and have not been ſeduced nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from the right ways of the Lord, but ſtill keep God's commandments, and have the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Jeſus Chriſt, in his pure goſpel. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt all our declenſions and back-ſlidings, our diviſions and hereſies, our contentions and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, there remain yet in the land a godly rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the true ſeed of the woman, who have not been enticed away to worſhip the beaſt, nor prevailed upon to receive his mark; who have never apoſtatiſed nor departed from the faith and practice of the church, as firſt planted in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs; but have continued ſtedfaſt and immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able amidſt all the ſtorms of temptation, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent aſſaults of the adverſary. And theſe ſeem the principal objects which excite the wrath and reſentment of the dragon, and againſt which, the whole artillery of his indignation and vengeance has been pointed and aimed. Who, tho' few in number, yet with ſuch other helps and advantages as they are furniſhed with, will overcome by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their teſtimony. Their fidelity, courage and zeal is ſuch, that ſhould it come to a caſe of extremity, they will not love their lives unto the death. But this part of the prophecy will admit of a different interpretation, and as well ſuit the preſent times.</p>
            <p>BY the "remnant of her ſeed," we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand thoſe worthy, true members of the church, ſtaunch friends to liberty and the proteſtant reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, who remained ſtill in the mother-country, and did not come over with her when ſhe took her flight into this wilderneſs. There has, ever ſince
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:015082_0036_0F95AAD497B7EE10"/>
the ſettlement of theſe colonies, been numbers of pious, godly perſons, on the other ſide of the water, who have been friendly and well-diſpoſed towards us, and have uſed all their power and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence to promote our growth, our wealth and proſperity. This remnant of the ſeed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſince our troubles have begun in America, have exerted themſelves to their utmoſt in our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, to divert the impending ſtorm of vengeance from lighting on us; have made moſt moving and affecting ſpeeches in parliament, on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; have publiſhed many uſeful pieces in vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the colonies; and have been, to the laſt degree, faithful in correſponding with their friends on this ſide of the Atlantic, to inform of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues and dark plots that were contriving againſt us. Theſe things, together with the diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhame and diſgrace that have attended the enterprizes of the dragon againſt us, have rouſed his wrath againſt them likewiſe, which appears by a very ſevere and extraordinary proclamation, publiſhed to forbid this correſpondence between them and us, on the higheſt penalty. And from the commotions that began to be raiſed among them therefor, ſhould this civil war continue, it is highly probable, that within the term of another year, it may flame forth from the very bowels of the kingdom, where it ſeems to be already kindling up, and where our brethren, which keep the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God, will unavoidably be diſtreſſed. But in the iſſue hereof, it is to be hoped, that the dragon will be wholly conſumed and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that the ſeat and foundation of all tyranny, perſecution and oppreſſion, may be for ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhed; that the horns, whether civil or eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:015082_0037_0F95AAD5E7F723E0"/>
may be knocked off from the beaſt, and his head receive a deadly wound, and his jaws be effectually broken; that peace, liberty and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs might univerſally prevail; that ſalvation and ſtrength might come to Zion; and the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of our God, and the power of his Chriſt might be eſtabliſhed to all the ends of the earth.</p>

               <p n="1">1. WE learn from what has been ſaid, the true cauſe, as well as the deplorable effects of all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions and violent commotions amidſt the Chriſtian ſtates and kingdoms of the world; which, like terrible earthquakes, to which they are compared, often ſhake them from the centre, and convulſe them to death and ruin. If we trace them up to their time, ſource, and origin, we ſhall preſently find, by the help of ſcripture-light, they all proceed from the inveterate envy and malice which the dragon has againſt the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and the war and conteſt he is carrying on againſt her, and her ſeed. This is plainly held forth in theſe prophecies of St. John, and is the grand ſubject of them. It has, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, been the conſtant aim and deſign of the dragon, ſometimes called the beaſt, and the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, ſatan, and the devil, to erect a ſcheme of abſolute deſpotiſm and tyranny on earth, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve all mankind in ſlavery and bondage; and ſo prevent their having that liberty and freedom which the Son of God came from heaven to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure for, and beſtow on them; that he might keep them in a ſtate of ſervile ſubjection to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:015082_0038_0F95AAD6122727E0"/>
He has been, and ſtill is the chief coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor and directing agent in all the dark plots of oppreſſion and perſecution againſt God's church, to effect her deſtruction; that his own wicked ſcheme of tyranny might have a full eſtabliſhment on earth, and bear down all before it. And it is truly marvellous what ſucceſs he has been permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to have in accompliſhing this malignant deſign: How, not only men of lower abilities and leſs diſcernment have been deluded and infatuated by him; but many kings and chief rulers in church and ſtate, of whom better things might have been expected. Such, after they have been made drunk with the intoxicating wine of his fornication and whoredom, have been his chief inſtruments in this cruel and bloody work. They are of ſuch dark complexion in their counſels, and purſuing ſuch black deſigns, that they are repreſented as "aſcending out of the bottomleſs pit, to make war againſt the faithful witneſſes and ſervants of Jeſus Chriſt, and to kill them." And who can count up the numbers that have been ſlain by them? Rivers of blood have been ſhed, at one time and another, in this terrible war and conflict which the tyrannical, perſecuting powers of the earth have been inſtigated by Satan, to carry on againſt the church of Chriſt. In the firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Chriſtian diſpenſation, ten perſecutions followed ſucceſſively one after another, while the government of Rome was in the hands of pagan emperors.</p>
               <p>IN this ſtruggle between Paganiſm and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, thouſands of martyrs and confeſſors were moſt cruelly and barbarouſly tormented, and put to death. Theſe horrid maſſacres of the ſaints
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:015082_0039_0F95AAD6B61E8DA0"/>
may be emblematically, or figuratively repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the 6th chapter of this prophetic book, in the 9th verſe of which, the apoſtle is ſaid to have ſeen under the altar, the ſouls of them that were ſlain for the word of God, and for the teſtimony which they held. And after Rome became Chriſtian, or rather Papal, and the man of ſin made his public appearance, the woman and her ſeed, the humble followers of Chriſt, fared yet worſe, and were more hardly and cruelly dealt with than ever, by their perſecuting enemies, who are inwardly galled in their conſciences, and ſaid to be tormented at their pure doctrines, plain faithful remonſtrances, and exemplary lives. See chap. xi. 10. When this great red dragon was mounted on high, with his ſeven heads and ten horns, the firſt object on which he exerciſed his tyrannical and perſecuting power, was the church, repreſented in theſe prophecies by the woman and her ſeed. Hence, when ſhe appeared pregnant, ready to bring forth children, when the goſpel began to have ſucceſs, and new converts were born, and added to the church, this dragon ſtood ready to ſeize and devour them, like a hungry lion, eagerly waiting for his prey; and has per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted her with rage and fierceneſs, not only thro' the imperial populous cities of Italy and Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia, France, Spain, and England, and thro' their colonies and plantations, even to the uttermoſt ends of the earth. When ſhe took the wings of the great eagle, and, under the protecting provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God fled into the wilderneſs, he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued wroth with her, and poured forth floods of his indignation and vengeance againſt her. "Wo to the inhabitants of the earth, and of the
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:015082_0040_0F95AAD787EE6928"/>
ſea," ſays the apoſtle, "for the devil is come down to them, having great wrath, becauſe he knoweth that he hath but a ſhort time." This dragon, the great enemy of God, and of his church, whatever ſhape or form he has aſſumed, whether that of the ſpotted leopard, with the feet of a bear, and the mouth of a lion; whether his horns have been ten, or only two, like a lamb or goat, giving life unto the image of the beaſt; yet he has in every appearance, when he had oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, diſcovered the like fierceneſs and cruelty of temper, thirſting for the blood of the ſaints. When his ſhape and form has wore a milder aſpect, he has yet ſpoke as a dragon; and when times would allow of it, exerciſed all the power of the firſt beaſt, cauſing the earth, and them that dwell therein, to worſhip him; giving forth tyrannical mandates and decrees, that as many as would not worſhip the image of the beaſt, ſhould be killed: Gathering all into his ſervice, both ſmall and great, rich and poor, free and bond, ſlaves and ſavages, catholics and barbarians, to accompliſh at any rate, his black and dark deſigns; paſſing the moſt vigorous acts, and ſevere edicts againſt thoſe who refuſed compliance; enacting by his omipotent power, that they ſhould not buy nor ſell, nor carry on any trade or commerce by land or ſea. Now, the adminiſtration ſeems here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, that has for a number of years, been ſo grievous and diſtreſſing to theſe colonies in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, claiming an abſolute power and authority to make laws, binding in all caſes whatever, without check or controul from any; which has proceeded in the exerciſe of this deſpotic, arbitrary power, to deprive one of them, of their moſt eſſentail
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:015082_0041_0F95AAD8429E6518"/>
and chartered privileges; ſent over fleets and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to enforce their cruel, tyrannical edicts, which have involved us in all the calamities and horrors of a civil war; which have deſtroyed many uſeful lives, burnt two of our flouriſhing towns, captured many of our veſſels that fell in their way, prohibited and deſtroyed our fiſhery and trade, forbidding us to buy or ſell, and taken in a hoſtile manner, in a way of piracy and robbery, our intereſt and property, and threaten us with general deſtruction, for no other reaſon than that we will not ſurrender our liberties, properties and privileges, and become abject vaſſals and ſlaves to deſpotic and arbitrary power. I ſay, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration ſeems deſcribed, and appears to have many of the features, and much of the temper and character of the image of the beaſt which the apoſtle repreſents, which had two horns like a lamb, and ſpoke as a dragon. And the language of our puſillanimous foes, and even their adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents amongſt us, ſeems plainly predicted, Rev. xiii. 4. "Who is like unto the beaſt? Who is able to make war with him."</p>
               <p n="2">2. FROM what has been ſaid, we ſee reaſon gratefully to acknowledge and adore the kind, watchful providence of God, in preſerving his church, the woman and her ſeed, amidſt the ſtorms and tempeſts, the commotions and convulſions that have been occaſioned by the oppreſſive tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical powers of the earth. The great dragon, her formidable enemy, notwithſtanding his mighty ſtrength and power, cruelty and rage, has always been overcome by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their teſtimony, in all her wars and conflicts with him; which, inſtead of anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:015082_0042_0F95AAD8F6D44528"/>
his deſign to cruſh and deſtroy her, have ever been over-ruled by her all-wiſe benevolent king, to promote her growth and advancement in the world. The church, though often ſurrounded by the flames of perſecution, like the burning buſh which Moſes beheld as a type and emblem of it, yet has never been conſumed. The gates of death and hell have never prevailed againſt her. Chriſt has been with her from the beginning, agreeable to his divine promiſe; and will ſo continue to the end of the world. The blood of the faints and martyrs that has been ſhed, and flowed down like rivers and ſeas, has been like ſeed planted for the church, and made it ſpread thro' a wider compaſs, and grow faſter in the world. All the combined policy of earth and hell has not been able to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw and demoliſh this building of God, who has eſtabliſhed it, and will preſerve it by his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power, till all the purpoſes of his redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing love and grace are accompliſhed in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete ſalvation of his choſen ones. It muſt be confeſſed, that the trials, afflictions and diſtreſſes of the church have been very great; but theſe have been as a purifying furnace, to cleanſe her from droſs and corruption, and to make her ſhine brighter in all the graces and virtues of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity. Her enemies and adverſaries, in all their furious attacks and malicious encounters, have never gained any conſiderable and laſting advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to themſelves; but generally have come off with loſs, diſappointment and ſhame; and had their own weapons, and the blows they have ſtruck, retorted back on them, with redoubled force and vengeance. God promiſes to give pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to his faithful witneſſes and ſervants, "And if
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:015082_0043_0F95AADC6B3A9AC8"/>
any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies. And if any man will hurt them, he muſt in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner be killed." Rev. ii. 3, 5. If the enemies of the church, in the wars they ſet on foot, take any of her members captive, they themſelves ſhall go into captivity; and he that killeth them with the ſword, muſt be killed with the ſword: Agreeable to the great law of retaliation, which is wiſely adopted at this day, by the honourable Continental CONGRESS; and the execution of it in full, is warranted and juſtified by this, and and other paſſages of ſacred writ. Thoſe that have undertaken to diſtreſs and perſecute the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and her ſeed, the faithful ſervants of Chriſt, have ever found the interprize dangerous and ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to themſelves. When the wicked perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting tyrants of the earth, appear to have great power and ſtrength, ſome of a ſelfiſh and time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous turn of mind, may inadvertantly think it ſafeſt to pay worſhip and allegiance to them, and receive their mark, and ſeek ſhelter and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection under their wings, from the impending ſtorm: But they are moſt artfully deluded and miſtaken. "The ſame," ſays the apoſtle, Rev. xiv. 10. "ſhall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture, into the cup of his indignation. And he ſhall be tormented with fire and brimſtone, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the holy angels, and in the preſence of the Lamb; and the ſmoke of their torment aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up for ever and ever, and they have no reſt day nor night."</p>
               <p n="3">3. WE may, in a peculiar manner, notice the kind dealings of God in his providence towards
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:015082_0044_0F95AADE0EA42B40"/>
this branch of his church, that he has planted as a choice vine, in this once howling wilderneſs. He brought her as on eagles wings from the ſeat of oppreſſion and perſecution, "to her own place," has, of his unmerited grace, beſtowed liberties and privileges upon her, beyond what are enjoyed in any other part of the world: He has nouriſhed and protected her from the face of the ſerpent, and preſerved her from being carried away to deſtruction, when great floods of his wrath and vengeance have been poured forth after her. God has, in this American quarter of the globe, provided for the woman and her ſeed, a fixed and laſting ſettlement and habitation, and beſtowed it upon her, to be her own property for ever<note n="*" place="bottom">As the church has ſuch a gift and grant of this good land, from that God to whom the earth belongs, and the fulneſs thereof; the preſent war ſet on foot by the Britiſh miniſtry and parliament, againſt her true and worthy members, the American ſons of liberty, to diſpoſſeſs them hereof, is not only felonious and murderous, as ſtiled by the noble Lord Mayor of London, in his excellent ſpeech on this ſubject; but ſeems likewiſe a very bold and daring attack upon the ſovereign prerogative of that Being, who is the Great Lord Proprietor of all, to whom vengeance belongeth; who has already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed in a very ſignal manner, to diſplay his awful vengeance againſt this wicked nefarious undertaking, by plunging four thouſand of theſe our malignant foes in the ocean, with an hundred and fifty thouſand pounds ſterling of their property; by ſetting fire to two of their ſhips with lightening from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and by a late very ſweeping ſtorm on the coaſts of Great-Britain, to an immenſe deſtruction of both men and ſhipping; by which, and other remarkable providences in our favour, we have inconteſtible evidence, that God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, with all the powers of heaven, are on our ſide. Great numbers of angels, no doubt, are encamping round our coaſt, for our defence and protection. Michael ſtands ready, with all the artillery of heaven, to encounter the dragon, and to vanquiſh this black hoſt.</note>. In this juſt view of the diſtinguiſhed
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:015082_0045_0F95AADE9A3895E0"/>
favours of heaven toward our fathers, and us their ſinful poſterity, while on the one hand, we ſee abundant cauſe for thankſgiving and praiſe to our almighty preſerver, and moſt gracious bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor; we may on the other hand ſee the greateſt reaſon for the deepeſt humiliation, repentance, and contrition of heart, for our vile abuſe and miſimprovement of theſe privileges and favours. What an amazing low ſenſe have we had, of the worth of the uncommon gifts and bounties of heaven? How awfully have they been ſlighted and undervalued by us? What aſtoniſhing ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, ingratitude and unthankfulneſs has reigned in our hearts? How lukewarm and indifferent have we been, in the moſt important concerns of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion? How careleſs and unconcerned about the intereſt and welfare of the church of Chriſt? How backward to come into fellowſhip and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with her, and to attend the rites and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances which diſtinguiſh (at leaſt outwardly) God's children from the profane wicked world? How does iniquity abound among us, and the love of many wax cold? How has the gold become dim, the moſt fine gold changed? What awful back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlidings and declenſions in this land, once dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the Lord as a mountain of holineſs, and an habitation of righteouſneſs, liberty and peace? Surely the great head of the church, who knows our works, muſt have not a few, but many things againſt us. We have, in a great meaſure, loſt that lively faith, zeal and brotherly love, ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous in the temper and conduct of our pious fore fathers, and added ſuch a beauty and luſtre to their characters. The true and noble ſpirit of primitive chriſtianity is ſcarce to be found among
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:015082_0046_0F95AAE036A6F780"/>
us; have loſt our firſt love, the love of our eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals, and kindneſs of our youth. Our churches decline in doctrine, worſhip and diſcipline; and have had awful ſchiſms and rents made in them. A ſpirit of contention, diviſion and ſeparation has prevailed to the great wounding of the church, and to the diſhonour and ſhame of all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters and abettors thereof. How have the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, the faithful witneſſes of Chriſt, been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed and treated with contempt; while prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſying in ſackcloth; and the woman, the true church, in her plain dreſs of goſpel purity and ſimplicity, been ridiculed, and thought to have no beauty or comelineſs in her? How eager have many been, in their attention to lying de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers, the frogs that have iſſued out of the mouth of the falſe prophet; and charmed and captivated with their croaking noiſe, full of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord and confuſion? How has the beauty of this pleaſant land of Immanuel been defaced, and its glory ſpoiled by the little foxes treading down our tender vines; and by the inroads of the wild boar of the wilderneſs? Theſe things are juſtly mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of deep and ſerious lamentation, as they are doubtleſs the cauſes of the preſent calamities and judgments with which we are viſited.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As there ſtill remains among us, a godly remnant that have not apoſtatized from God, nor departed from the faith of the goſpel; and as theſe prophecies on which we have been treating, will, many of them, moſt probably have their fulfilment in this land; there are yet ſolid grounds of hope and encouragement for us, in this dark and gloomy day. Tho' we may, in God's righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous providence, be ſorely rebuked and chaſtiſed
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:015082_0047_0F95AAE159FCE0B8"/>
for our woful apoſtacies, declenſions and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlidings; yet we have, I think, good reaſon to believe, from the prophecies, ſo far as we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to underſtand them, and from the general plan of God's providence, ſo far as opened to view, in paſt and preſent diſpenſations of it, that we ſhall not be wholly given up to deſolation and ruin. It is not likely nor probable, that God will revoke the grant he has made of this land to his church. His gifts as well as calling are without repentance. It does not appear probable, that a perſecuting, oppreſſive and tyrannical pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, will ever be permitted to rear up its head and horns in it, notwithſtanding its preſent violent aſſaults and ſtruggles. Liberty has been planted here; and the more it is attacked, the more it grows and flouriſhes. The time is coming and haſtening on, when Babylon the great ſhall fall to riſe no more; when all wicked tyrants and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors ſhall be deſtroyed for ever. Theſe violent attacks upon the woman in the wilderneſs, may poſſibly be ſome of the laſt efforts, and dying ſtruggles of the man of ſin. Theſe commotions and convulſions in the Britiſh empire, may be leading to the fulfilment of ſuch prophecies as relate to his downfal and overthrow, and to the future glory and proſperity of Chriſt's church. It will ſoon be ſaid and acknowledged, that the kingdoms of this world, are become the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of our Lord, and of his Chriſt. The vials of God's wrath begin to be poured out on his enemies and adverſaries; and there is falling on them a noiſome and grievous ſore. And to ſuch as have ſhed the blood of ſaints and prophets, to them, blood will be given to drink; for they
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:015082_0048_0F95AAE1F539DAC0"/>
are worthy. And they will gnaw their tongues of falſehood and deceit, for pain; and have the cup of the wine of the fierceneſs of her wrath; and be rewarded double. The Lamb ſhall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them, for he is Lord of Lords, and King of Kings; and they that are with him, are called, and choſen, and faithful. May the Lord ſhorten the days of tribulation, and appear in his glory, to build up Zion; that his knowledge might co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the earth, as the waters do the ſeas; that wars and tumults may ceaſe thro' the world, and the wolf and the lamb lie down together, and nothing hurt or deſtroy throughout his holy mountain.</p>

            <byline>BY ANOTHER HAND.</byline>
            <p>IN the thirteenth chapter of Revelation, the apoſtle ſaw in viſion, two beaſts coming up; which, as far as I am acquainted, expoſitors have generally explained as a two-fold figurative repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the ſame event. But to me it appears, that as the beaſts were very diverſe, the one from the other; ſo very different events were fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured out by them. It is ſaid, verſe 1. "And I ſtood upon the ſand of the ſea, and ſaw a beaſt riſe up out of the ſea" i. e. out of the church, "having ſeven heads, and ten horns," &amp;c. And in the 11th verſe, it is ſaid, "And I beheld another beaſt coming up out of the earth," i. e. of an earthly extract, ſpringing up from ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry terrene, ſenſual motives, "and he had two horns like a lamb, and he ſpake as a dragon." This firſt beaſt here deſcribed, has been well explained by expoſitors, and applied to the <hi>man of ſin,</hi> to the riſe and eſtabliſhment of popery. But this ſecond beaſt, with equal juſtice and propriety, may be conſidered as figurative of, and fulfilled in what is called, King HENRY's refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. Every one that is acquainted with the
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:015082_0050_0F95AAE8AE56D2D0"/>
perſonal character of that prince, cannot but be ſenſible, that the motives by which he was influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſeparate from the church of Rome, were of a very terrene, ſenſual, earthly nature; fitly deſcribed by the beaſt's coming up out of the earth. "And he had two horns," civil and ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical power, "like a lamb," with a more mild, benign and favourable aſpect on the church, than the firſt beaſt. King Henry, when he broke with the Pope, aſſumed the chief and ſupreme authority in the Britiſh church, as well as nation; here decyphered by the "two horns." And "he ſpake as a dragon." Witneſs, the many hot and cruel perſecutions that have been carried on in the kingdom, ſince the reformation, to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of multitudes of the faithful ſervants of Jeſus Chriſt. Altho' Henry aſſumed headſhip in the church as well as ſtate; yet it was a work of time to get himſelf acknowledged and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in that character; in the accompliſhment of which, he may be ſaid, "To do great won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders," &amp;c. Verſe 13, 14. "Saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they ſhould make an image to the beaſt, which had the wound by a ſword, and did live," i. e. the firſt beaſt, the Pope.</p>
            <p>THE apoſtle Paul, propheſied of the man of ſin, 2 Theſſ. ii. 4. and deſcribes him as one, "Who oppoſeth and exalteth himſelf above all that is called God, or is worſhipped; ſo that he as God ſitteth in the temple of God, ſhewing himſelf that he is God." Claiming to be the head of the church, and aſſuming ſupreme, ſovereign, abſolute authority in it, is here pointed out as the grand, pecular, and diſtinguiſhing mark and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:015082_0051_0F95AAE8DA0BFFD0"/>
of the man of ſin; moſt clearly and plainly fulfilled in the Pope. Conſequently, headſhip and ſupremacy in the church, muſt be the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar and diſtinguiſhing features of this image of the firſt beaſt, which the ſecond beaſt required to be made. And what can be a more clear, plain and expreſs fulfilment of this prophecy, than that ſupremacy in the church, given to our kings, ever ſince the reformation, by the Britiſh eccleſiaſtical conſtitution? Where can we find any thing in all hiſtory, that bids ſo fair for an accompliſhment of this emblematical prediction, in the riſing of the ſecond beaſt? Nothing but a fond partiality, of applying every thing that is bad, to the Pope, can, I conceive, prevent our embracing this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the prophecy.</p>
            <p>"LET not thoſe who are friends to the epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal form of church government, look upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves pointed at, by any thing I have here ſaid. For real epiſcopacy does not imply an alliance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween church and ſtate; nor neceſſarily require an earthly head to the church; much leſs to inveſt the king with that character, as every one muſt acknowledge who will plead for epiſcopacy as the primitive form of the church, ſet up by the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles. Becauſe all the kings of the earth, in their day, and for many years after, were ſo far from being eſteemed heads to the church, that they were not ſo much as members in it."</p>
            <p>THE time prefixed for the continuance of the firſt beaſt, is "forty and two months." See verſe 5. But the number of the ſecond beaſt is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the 18th verſe. "Here is wiſdom. Let him that hath underſtanding count the number of the beaſt: For it is the number of a man, and
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:015082_0052_0F95AAEA925B10F0"/>
his number is ſix hundred threeſcore and ſix." Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitors have, many of them, ſuppoſed that this number intended the period from the time the apoſtle's receiving this viſion, to the riſing of the firſt beaſt. But as this is the number of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond beaſt, if it be applied in ſuch a manner, it muſt be taken for that period between the riſe of the firſt, and of the ſecond beaſt. But as the continuance of the firſt beaſt was limited to forty two prophetic months, or a thouſand two hundred and ſeventy ſeven years; ſo this number ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſixty ſix, may denote the duration of the ſecond beaſt.</p>
