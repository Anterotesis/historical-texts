            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE late ſurpriſing and awful <hi>Event</hi> of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence wherein the <hi>moſt High GOD</hi> hath paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed before us, in an amazing <hi>Earthquake,</hi> of vaſt <hi>extent</hi> and in a <hi>degree</hi> of uncommon ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; whether we conſider the greatneſs of the <hi>Shock,</hi> or the great <hi>noiſe</hi> that attended it; is the occaſion of <hi>publiſhing</hi> the following <hi>Sermons,</hi> tho' not of the <hi>preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> them all.</p>
            <p>For within the <hi>month</hi> wherein the <hi>earthquake</hi> came I had preached <hi>twice</hi> to my People from this awful <hi>Subject, The Judgments of Providence in the hand of CHRIST:</hi> to which I added <hi>three</hi> Sermons more, in a proper and ſerious <hi>Application</hi> of the Subject to ſo ſingular and uncommon a <hi>Providence;</hi> wherein I have conſider'd the <hi>Earthquake in the hand of CHRIST,</hi> and what <hi>his voice to us</hi> is in that teaching and affecting Diſpenſation. Theſe <hi>five</hi> Sermons I have here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into <hi>three,</hi> only pointing the <hi>Reader</hi> where he may divide the contracted <hi>double</hi> Sermons, for the uſe and benefit of his houſhold.</p>
            <p>It is only the <hi>Chriſtian Improvement</hi> of this awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Providence that I have here attended to, and the <hi>Reader</hi> is deſired to expect no other; leaving the Enquiry into the <hi>natural Cauſes</hi> of Earthquakes, and the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of them, to a <hi>better Hand,</hi> which has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd to gratify the <hi>Publick</hi> therewith.</p>
            <p>Something of the <hi>Scriptural hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>Earthquake</hi> is here given, and the peculiar honour of theſe <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes</hi> is their ſincere Aim to render unto CHRIST the glory of this tremendous <hi>Judgment,</hi> and of our <hi>Preſervation</hi> in it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:002853_0004_0FE67810CED7E958"/>
To HIM therefore let theſe <hi>Meditations</hi> be ſacred (however mean and unworthy to be offer'd to his glorious <hi>Name</hi>) according to the Commandment and declared Will of the FATHER to us, Who <hi>hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted all judgment to the SON, that all men ſhould honour the Son even as they honour the father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our LORD has viſited us this year as he told <hi>Ariel,</hi> the City where <hi>David</hi> dwelt, that it ſhould be <hi>viſited of the LORD of hoſts with Thunder, and with Earthquake, and with great Noiſe; with Storm and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, and the flame of devouring Fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The great noiſe of <hi>thunder</hi> we have often heard, I hope with trembling and godly fear, as <hi>Elihu</hi> did in his day. And we have ſcarce ever heard more of it in a <hi>ſummer,</hi> than in this which is now paſt. But we never heard <hi>the great noiſe of an Earthquake</hi> till in the late <hi>calm and ſtill night,</hi> when it came ruſhing and roaring on us in hollow ſubterraneous <hi>thunders,</hi> the beſt and trueſt Compariſon I can make of it.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>the flame of devouring fire</hi> we had very much of it in the ſultry and parching extream <hi>heat</hi> of the ſummer, of a long continuance, for many weeks to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. This <hi>burning drought</hi> penetrated far into the earth, ſo that many wells and ſprings of water fail'd that never had before. Some have been ready to ask, Whether <hi>this</hi> might contribute any thing, as a natural cauſe in the hand of CHRIST, to the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake that has follow'd upon the rains and cold of <hi>Autumn,</hi> which ſuddenly ſet in after ſo uncommon and long a <hi>heat?</hi> But when we ſearch (as I think we muſt) <hi>very deep</hi> after the probable natural Cauſe of ſo <hi>great</hi> a ſhake, I am conſtrained to drop this burning <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> on the <hi>ſurface,</hi> had it been more than it was.</p>
            <p>In the midſt of this <hi>ſultry</hi> heat, and in the <hi>Evening</hi> after a very <hi>parching</hi> day, (<hi>Auguſt.</hi> 1.) the Heavens broke out into a continued <hi>blaze</hi> of flame and <hi>roar</hi> of thunder, horrible to behold and hear, for two or three hours together. The <hi>flaſhes</hi> of lightning were almoſt
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:002853_0005_0FE64683A0EFB3A0"/>without intermiſſion, and conſequently the <hi>peal</hi> of thunder perpetual in our ears; As if <hi>the heavens being on fire were diſſolving and paſſing away with a great noiſe, and the earth alſo with its works were to be burnt up.</hi> Yet the lightning did little or no hurt that I heard of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Forty ſix</hi> days after this, namely on the 16th. of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> the ſame <hi>Almighty power</hi> in like majeſty and terror came down to us in the <hi>whirlwind</hi> and in the <hi>ſtorm,</hi> and the <hi>clouds were the duſt of his feet; He made darkneſs his ſecret place, his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.</hi> The furious <hi>wind</hi> ſhiver'd the mighty <hi>oaks</hi> and the ſtrong <hi>elms,</hi> tore off their vaſt <hi>branches</hi> as a man plucks a <hi>twig</hi> with his hand, and turn'd up the wide <hi>roots</hi> of innumerable trees with all their <hi>turf</hi> cleaving to them into the air; a new and ſtrange <hi>ſpectacle</hi> of deſolation in the fields and woods. Yet it pleas'd GOD again to preſerve our dwellings and our lives that tempeſtuous day and night; Only a family or two ſuffer'd by loſs of <hi>life</hi> or broken <hi>bones,</hi> who had the due and hearty Sympathy of their ſpared nei'bours.</p>
            <p>And now that after all <hi>this flame, thunder and tempeſt,</hi> at the end of <hi>forty three</hi> days more, <hi>October.</hi> 29. we ſhould be viſited with a tremendous <hi>Earthquake,</hi> has fill'd the year with ſo many remarkable <hi>threatnings of judgment</hi> as were never known among us before in ſo ſhort a compaſs of time. Truly the LORD has paſſed by in the <hi>great and ſtrong wind,</hi> in the <hi>flame</hi> and <hi>earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake;</hi> and what ſhould follow but <hi>his ſmall and ſtill voice</hi> in his preached Word? if we might be ſo happy and honoured of him as to interpret his <hi>Providences</hi> aright, and bring his mind and will in ſuch a clear and ſtrong light, as by the bleſſing of the HOLY SPIRIT to make ſutable and ſaving impreſſions upon our ſouls.</p>
            <p>There is but one <hi>doub,</hi> in a way of <hi>Speculation,</hi> that I would here propoſe, and in a few words offer to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve: namely,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="unknown:002853_0006_0FE64683B32D74A8"/>
Whence might it come to paſs, that the late <hi>ſhock</hi> of the Earth was <hi>felt,</hi> and the <hi>noiſe</hi> or roar of the earth <hi>heard,</hi> in all the very <hi>diſtant</hi> places to which it reach'd, ſo far as we can yet learn, <hi>at</hi> or very near <hi>the ſame moment of time?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſee not how <hi>this</hi> can be accounted for, but by ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the <hi>whole Shake</hi> to come from <hi>one ſingle blaſt</hi> or ſtroke, in ſome mighty <hi>Cavern</hi> at a vaſt <hi>depth</hi> in the earth: Where let us ſuppoſe a vaſt body of prepared <hi>ſulphurious matter,</hi> like that from whence the <hi>lightnings and thunders</hi> in our air proceed; or if you pleaſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it to that prodigious preparation of man on earth <hi>Gun-powder:</hi> Let us imagine a <hi>quantity</hi> hereof ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to ſhake a <hi>Circle</hi> of our Earth of <hi>five hundred miles diameter;</hi> which I take to be much <hi>within</hi> the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the <hi>Circle</hi> ſhaken by our late Earthquake, which reach'd from our moſt <hi>northern</hi> bounds as far ſouthward as <hi>Philadelphia:</hi> Say now that this prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous quantity of prepared ſulphureous matter <hi>take fire</hi> all at once, and <hi>blow up,</hi> tearing to pieces a vaſt part of the <hi>Intrails</hi> of the earth, but chiefly diſcharging it ſelf into the mighty <hi>Deep</hi> below, while at the ſame time it muſt alſo ſtrike dreadfully <hi>upwards,</hi> and <hi>heave</hi> at once the earth of ſuch a circle as is before named, and ſet it all a <hi>trembling</hi> near the ſame inſtant of time: But then in the <hi>extremities</hi> of the Circle the <hi>ſhake</hi> will naturally be <hi>leſs,</hi> and toward the <hi>center</hi> of it more; and the <hi>noiſe</hi> of the blaſt below will naturally <hi>accompany</hi> the ſhock it gives, and be <hi>heard</hi> every where in that inſtant that the ſhake is <hi>felt,</hi> and in <hi>proportion</hi> to the ſhock the noiſe will be in one place and another.</p>
            <p>This is my plain and ſhort <hi>reaſoning</hi> upon the point, and I am glad to find I am <hi>not alone</hi> in it; ſuppoſing the <hi>Letter from Marblehead</hi> to mean the ſame thing, when it ſays, <q>I am ready to conclude that the ſhocks were <hi>general</hi> and at the <hi>ſame</hi> time, and that <hi>their direction was from beneath upwards, and not along the ſurface of the earth.</hi>
               </q> That this <hi>opinion</hi> is right

            <p>Every <hi>Generation,</hi> I ſuppoſe, may look for Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes in this <hi>Continent;</hi> and in every <hi>Century</hi> ſome very <hi>great</hi> ſhocks may be reaſonably expected. <hi>Sixty five</hi> years are now paſſing ſince the Land was ſhook much as it was now: The <hi>pewter</hi> fell off the ſhelves, the <hi>joice</hi> wro't in and out of the mortices as the houſes rock'd, the <hi>lids</hi> of warming-pans were flung up; <hi>paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers</hi> on the way were unable to keep their feet and ſat down while the ground <hi>heav'd</hi> them: Something alſo of the like noiſe and <hi>rore</hi> of the earth accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>that</hi> ſhake.</p>
            <p>Many <hi>ſmaller</hi> ſhakes have been felt ſince. <hi>Greater</hi> and more dreadful ones may be expected, as the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> fills more with <hi>ſin.</hi> For the <hi>Great GOD</hi> foreſees all the <hi>Events of nature</hi> in its courſe, and the <hi>Sins of places</hi> and people in their courſe and increaſe; and in his moſt wiſe and juſt <hi>Government</hi> of the World they exactly <hi>tally</hi> one with the other, to his infinite glory and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting praiſe from the <hi>Intellectual</hi> world.</p>
            <p>We may conceive that every ſuch <hi>blaſt</hi> from within the bowels of the Earth, very much <hi>thins the cruſt</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>ſurface</hi> whereon we live and the <hi>Abyſſe</hi> of fire below.

By all of which <hi>they</hi> gain more and more upwards. At the Contemplation of theſe things our <hi>fleſh</hi> may well <hi>tremble becauſe of GOD,</hi> and we ſhould be <hi>afraid of his judgments.</hi>

            <p>The viſitation by <hi>Earthquakes</hi> this year ſeems direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more eſpecially to <hi>Great Britain</hi> and its <hi>Dominions.</hi> The accounts from thence tell us of <hi>Earthquakes</hi> there the laſt <hi>July,</hi>
               <q>preceeded by a <hi>mighty noiſe</hi> like thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at a diſtance; the houſes ſhook, the walls of gardens rock'd like a cradle, the tops of ſeveral chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys fell; many left their houſes in great fear think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them falling on 'em, and others were toſs'd in their beds.</q> What the <hi>import</hi> of theſe things may be to a ſinful (otherwiſe happy) <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and to theſe <hi>Provinces;</hi> Whether our holy <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> or our <hi>Civil Liberties</hi> are to be ſhaken; as GOD only knows, ſo may He avert the <hi>Omen.</hi> Our part is <hi>to make ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to our Judge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To be ſure the great <hi>Mercy</hi> of GOD to us in our <hi>Preſervation</hi> ought greatly to <hi>affect</hi> us, and never be forgotten.

                        <p>And he ſpake unto the Man clothed with linnen, and ſaid, Go in between the Wheels, even under the Cherub, and fill thy hand with coals of fire from between the Cherubims, and ſcatter them over the City: And he went in in my ſight.</p>

                  <p>FOR the underſtanding theſe <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>awful</hi> words we muſt know, 1. who the <hi>Man</hi> is here ſpoken to, <hi>clothed with linnen;</hi> 2. <hi>who</hi> ſpeaks to him; and then 3. conſider the meaning of the <hi>thing</hi> commanded him and done by him.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>Man</hi> here ſpoken unto, <hi>clothed with linnen,</hi> is no other than the Man CHRIST JESUS; the eternal <hi>Son of God</hi> appearing in faſhion as a <hi>man;</hi> that <hi>Son of man</hi> whom the FATHER hath made <hi>ſtrong</hi> for himſelf, and who is now ſet down on the right hand of GOD, our <hi>High prieſt</hi> and <hi>King,</hi> both to make <hi>interceſſion</hi> and alſo to execute <hi>judgment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We read of the ſame <hi>Man</hi> before preſiding over the executioners of the wrath and judgments of God; <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.2. <hi>And behold ſix men came from the north, every
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002853_0010_0FE64685A6962898"/>man with his ſlaughter weapon in his hand, and One man among them was cloathed with linnen.</hi> HE was not one of the <hi>ſix,</hi> but they were miniſters and ſervants under <hi>Him,</hi> and obeyed his orders. Here are <hi>ſix Angels</hi> the miniſters of the GOD MAN Mediator, hearkening to the voice of his word, to do his pleaſure while he performs the whole counſel and purpoſe of GOD.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>ninth Chapter</hi> this glorious <hi>Perſon</hi> clothed in linnen is the miniſter of <hi>mercy,</hi> v. 4. employed to go thro' the city and to <hi>ſet his mark on the men that ſighed and cried for the Abominations done therein.</hi> In this <hi>tenth Chapter</hi> he appears as the miniſter of GOD's <hi>vengeance,</hi> as will preſently be ſeen. And theſe <hi>two</hi> are indeed the ſumm of thoſe <hi>Offices</hi> which CHRIST executes as <hi>Mediator</hi> between GOD and man: He effectually <hi>ſaves</hi> the Elect of GOD from ſin and wrath, and then he executes <hi>judgment</hi> on all the reſt, who will not be ſaved from ſin by him.</p>
                  <p>CHRIST appears here in his <hi>prieſtly</hi> Office, <hi>clothed in linnen;</hi> for the Prieſts of old were ſo clothed; the <hi>white linnen</hi> being ſignificant of <hi>purity and holineſs;</hi> their <hi>profeſſion</hi> thereof, and their <hi>bonds</hi> to it. The ſpotleſs holineſs and ſhining righteouſneſs of CHRIST is the thing here repreſented. As we read, Revel. 19.8. <hi>The fine linnen is the righteouſneſs of the ſaints.</hi> But here the <hi>linnen</hi> clothing is the righteouſneſs of the Holy JESUS himſelf. He clothes believers in his <hi>own</hi> righteouſneſs, and makes them <hi>prieſts to GOD,</hi> and they ſhall walk with him <hi>in white.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>CHRIST is here a <hi>prieſt upon his throne,</hi> the judge and the prieſt together. This is the <hi>Man,</hi> the <hi>ſinleſs</hi> man, more than a man.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This Man is <hi>ſpoken</hi> to: <hi>HE ſpake unto the Man clothed with linnen and ſaid.</hi> It is <hi>God the Father,</hi> the ſupream <hi>Majeſty,</hi> who here ſpeaks to CHRIST, as his <hi>Servant</hi> whom he upholds, his <hi>Elect</hi> in whom his
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002853_0011_0FE677E78296A8A0"/>heart delighteth. The voice and words came from the <hi>Throne,</hi> ſays the firſt verſe. <hi>Then I looked</hi> (ſays the Prophet) <hi>and behold in the firmament that was above the head of the Cherubims, there appeared over them as it were a ſapphire ſtone, as the appearance of the likeneſs of a THRONE; and HE ſpake unto the man clothed in lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen,</hi> &amp;c. That is, the <hi>enthroned MAJESTY</hi> in the heavens, HE ſpake: <hi>GOD THE FATHER Almighty</hi> he ſpake to his Only begotten <hi>Son,</hi> the <hi>Man CHRIST JESUS.</hi> And now</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let us hear the <hi>things ſaid,</hi> and let him that heareth underſtand: <hi>Go in between the wheels, even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the cherub, and fill thine hand with coals of fire from between the cherubims, and ſcatter them over the city.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You muſt know that the day of the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was now at hand, even the <hi>burning</hi> of the City and Temple by the army of the king of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon. Zedekiah</hi> was now king of the remnant of <hi>Judah,</hi> his reign was ſhort and his ruine at hand; and the deſtruction of the city <hi>by fire</hi> is the thing here repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented and foretold. <hi>Burnt</hi> it was by <hi>Nebuzaradan</hi> captain of the guard, but <hi>who</hi> did it? why CHRIST the king and judge of the church and of the world. The <hi>Man</hi> the ordained <hi>judge,</hi> he goes in between the <hi>wheels;</hi> for he turns them all, high and dreadful as they are; <hi>He fill'd his hands with coals of fire from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the cherubims,</hi> for they had profaned his altars and his temple; and then he <hi>ſcattered the coals</hi> over the defiled city and ſanctuary, which was once <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the LORD.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was CHRIST's own hand did it: The flaming brands in the hand of the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> were the coals in <hi>his</hi> hand: <hi>They</hi> did but perform <hi>His</hi> holy word and will and dreadful pleaſure. They were the <hi>ſtaff of his indignation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="unknown:002853_0012_0FE677D6941F6DA0"/>
Finally obſerve, how readily and fully CHRIST executes the will of the FATHER in them whom he <hi>ſaves,</hi> and in them that <hi>periſh.</hi> Has the FATHER ſaid to Him, "<hi>Go ſet a mark</hi> on ſuch and ſuch to ſave them? He does it: Ezek. 9.11. <hi>And the man clothed with linnen reported the matter, ſaying, I have done as thou haſt commanded me.</hi> Or doth the FATHER ſay to CHRIST, "Go ſet the city in flames? He does it; The <hi>Prophet</hi> ſaw him go; <hi>He went in</hi> (ſays he) <hi>in my ſight.</hi> See alſo the 6 and 7 <hi>verſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the thing to be remarked is, That the <hi>burning coals,</hi> the diſpenſation of <hi>Judgments,</hi> are put into <hi>the hand of the Man clothed with linnen, and ſcattered</hi> by Him: Which teaches us this <hi>Doctrine</hi>— "That the preſent Judgments of Providence are put into the hand of CHRIST, and come forth from his hand.</p>
                  <p>But when I ſay the <hi>Judgments</hi> of Providence, it can't be meant in excluſion of the diſpenſations of <hi>Mercy</hi> and Grace; which as they do equally belong to the kingdom of <hi>Providence,</hi> ſo the adminiſtration of them is equally in the hand of CHRIST. Nor when we ſay that the diſpenſation <hi>both</hi> of mercy and of judgment is from the hand of the LORD JESUS, can this be underſtood in excluſion of, or derogation from the FATHER and the HOLY GHOST, as if the kingdom of <hi>Providence</hi> were not always in their glorious hand: For the glorious <hi>Perſons</hi> in the GODHEAD are one in eſſence and in operation. And altho' there is a ſpecial <hi>Mediatorial Kingdom</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the SON, which takes in the whole Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the kingdom till the conſummation of all things, when the whole <hi>myſtery</hi> of GOD ſhall be finiſhed; yet the <hi>FATHER worketh hitherto</hi> in and by the SON, and ſo doth the HOLY GHOST with and from Him; and this in a way of <hi>Sovereign</hi> dominion.
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002853_0013_0FE677E7AA773740"/>1 Cor. 12.11. <hi>All theſe worketh that one and ſelfſame SPIRIT, dividing to every man ſeverally as He will.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The SPIRIT of GOD is therefore repreſented as guiding all the motions of <hi>Providence,</hi> together with the SON OF MAN, in the viſions which <hi>Ezekiel</hi> had of the <hi>living creatures</hi> and of the <hi>wheels,</hi> Chap. 1.12, 19, 20. <hi>The living creatures</hi> (i. e. the Cherubims or Angels, miniſters in the executing of the Divine will) <hi>went ſtraight forward whither the SPIRIT directed them; and the wheels</hi> (the courſe of nature) <hi>followed them: Whitherſoever the SPIRIT went, they went; for the SPIRIT of life</hi> (ſo the Hebrew is) <hi>was in the wheels.</hi> So that we do not exclude the agency, power and ſovereign influence of the HOLY SPIRIT, in the judgments or mercies of Providence, when we ſay that theſe are put, into the hand of CHRIST; For the <hi>Man clothed with linnen</hi> is in the <hi>midſt</hi> of the ſame Wheels together with the <hi>SPIRIT of life;</hi> And while the <hi>SPIRIT lifts up the wheels,</hi> and the <hi>Cherubims</hi> act under his immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate direction; <hi>lo above the firmament</hi> appears the <hi>Throne,</hi> and the likeneſs of a <hi>Man</hi> upon it, with a <hi>rain-bow</hi> over his head, and <hi>fire</hi> from his loins down-ward. Ezek. 1.27, 28.</p>
                  <p>Having premiſed this <hi>guard</hi> on the ſacred <hi>Truth</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, I come now to the <hi>proof</hi> and illuſtration of it, in the plaineſt manner I can.

I. I argue from plain Scripture <hi>affirmations.</hi> And ſuch I take the following places to be: <hi>Pſalm</hi> 2. <hi>I have ſet my King upon my holy hill of Zion: I will declare the decree; the Lord hath ſaid unto me, Thou art my SON, this day have I begotten thee: Ask of me and I will give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the earth for thy poſſeſſion: Thou ſhalt break them with a rod of Iron, thou ſhalt daſh them in pieces like a potters veſſel. Be wiſe now therefore O ye kings, be inſtructed ye judges of the earth: ſerve the LORD with fear and rejoice with trembling: Kiſs the SON, leſt he be angry and ye periſh from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little: Bleſſed are all they that put their truſt in him.</hi> The ſum of this <hi>Pſalm</hi> is CHRIST's dominion over the kingdoms of men and his <hi>judgments</hi> on them. <hi>In vain</hi> do the <hi>rulers</hi> or <hi>people</hi> of them <hi>take counſel together, and rage againſt the LORD, and againſt his ANOIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TED: He ſhall ſpeak to them in his wrath and vex them in his ſore diſpleaſure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The like to <hi>this</hi> is the 110. <hi>Pſalm: The LORD ſaid to my LORD, ſet thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footſtool: The LORD ſhall ſend the rod of thy ſtrength out of Zion; rule thou in the midſt of thy ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: — Thou art a prieſt</hi> and king <hi>for ever,</hi> at my <hi>right hand,</hi> and ſhalt <hi>ſtrike thro' kings in the day of</hi> thy <hi>wrath;</hi> ſhalt <hi>judge among the heathen,</hi> and <hi>wound the heads over many countries.</hi> Here the judgments of Providence are put into CHRIST's hand, in words as plain and full as can well be utter'd.</p>
                  <p>At his firſt manifeſtation to <hi>Iſrael, John</hi> the <hi>baptiſt</hi> told them that <hi>his Fan was in his hand:</hi> Matth. 3.12. And He himſelf ſaid to them <hi>For judgment am I come.</hi> Luke 12.49. <hi>I am come to ſend fire upon earth; and what will I if it be already kindled?</hi> In what a <hi>ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign</hi> manner is this ſaid? as indeed having the <hi>coals</hi> of fire in his hand, to <hi>ſcatter</hi> them where he would. Agreeably he ſaid again, <hi>All power is given to me in
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002853_0015_0FE677EED94F8DA0"/>heaven and on earth.</hi> This power muſt take in that of all the preſent <hi>judgments</hi> of Providence. As he told the <hi>Jews,</hi> John. 5.22, 27. That <hi>the FATHER had committed all judgment to the SON, and given him authority to execute judgment,</hi> now and hereafter, <hi>becauſe he was the Son of man.</hi> The ſame thing is in effect ſaid over and over to the <hi>Chriſtian Churches</hi> in the ſecond and third <hi>Chapters</hi> of the <hi>Revelations</hi> of St. <hi>John.</hi> All theſe are plain <hi>Affirmations</hi> that the judgments of Providence are in the hand of CHRIST, and come forth from his hand.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. We have <hi>viſionary Repreſentations</hi> of this in the Book of God. My text is <hi>ſuch,</hi> wherein is repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the <hi>Prophet</hi> under the form of <hi>a Man clothed in linnen with his hands full of burning coals,</hi> the burning of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by the power and vengeance of CHRIST.

He is clad with <hi>zeal as with a cloke,</hi> while he is arrayed in <hi>the garments of ſalvation.</hi> The fire about the <hi>loins</hi> of the Son of man is alike ſignificant of his executing judgment, as the <hi>coals in his hand.</hi>

                  <p>But theſe <hi>viſionary</hi> repreſentations of the <hi>Son of man</hi> with the judgments of Providence in his hand are more abundant in the Book of the <hi>Revelations.</hi> So <hi>John</hi> ſaw him in the midſt of the <hi>golden Candleſticks,</hi> his feet as if they <hi>burned in a furnace,</hi> and his voice as the ſound of many waters, and out of his mouth a ſharp ſword.</p>
                  <p>In the 19. <hi>Chap.</hi> of that book, <hi>John</hi> ſaw a <hi>Man</hi> upon a white horſe, and in righteouſneſs he doth <hi>judge</hi> and make war: His eyes were <hi>as a flame of fire,</hi> and on his head were <hi>many</hi> Crowns, and he was clothed in a veſture dipt in <hi>blood,</hi> and his Name is called the WORD OF GOD: And the <hi>armies</hi> in heaven follow him, clothed in <hi>fine linnen</hi> white and clean, — Lo the <hi>livery</hi> of CHRIST, which the heavenly hoſts wear, the executioners of his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon men, ſuch as becomes his righteous and <hi>ſpotleſs</hi> adminiſtration. As <hi>He</hi> himſelf is clothed with <hi>linnen,</hi> ſo his <hi>armies</hi> follow him in fine and <hi>white</hi> linnen. Did you ever hear of an Army ſo <hi>clothed</hi> before? an army of <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>holy ones!</hi> of pure and ſpotleſs <hi>Spirits,</hi> the miniſters of his holy judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments!</p>
                  <p n="3">III. I come now to give you ſome <hi>Scripture Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> or <hi>Facts related,</hi> in which CHRIST has appeared unto men with the Judgments of Providence in his hand. And I will take theſe <hi>ſacred Stories</hi> in their <hi>order,</hi> as they ly in the <hi>Book</hi> of GOD.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> is the Judgment of GOD on wicked <hi>Sodom:</hi> With reſpect to which we read of <hi>three men</hi>
                     <pb n="9" facs="unknown:002853_0017_0FE677EEFA796410"/>(i. e. two Angels attending CHRIST their Lord and ours) who appeared to <hi>Abraham</hi> in the plains of <hi>Mamre,</hi> as he ſat in his tent-door, in the heat of the day. Gen. 18.1. <hi>Abraham</hi> as ſoon as he ſaw them ran to meet them, bowing himſelf to the earth; and perceiving that <hi>One</hi> of the three appeared much the Superior of the other two, he addreſſed himſelf in a particular manner, and with a more eſpecial reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Him, and ſaid, <hi>My Lord, If now I have found grace in thy ſight, paſs not I pray thee from thy ſervant.</hi> It was this <hi>Chief</hi> of the heavenly Gueſts that ſaid to <hi>Abraham,</hi> v. 10. <hi>I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life, and Sarah ſhall have a Son:</hi> At the hearing of which when <hi>Sarah</hi> laughed, it is ſaid v. 13. <hi>And the LORD ſaid to Abraham, Why did Sarah laugh?</hi> So that this Perſon was the LORD himſelf, in faſhion as a <hi>Man;</hi> and the other <hi>two</hi> were <hi>Angels,</hi> his ſervants and miniſters, who waited on him in this his deſcent to our earth.</p>
                  <p>But there was a more ſpecial reaſon of <hi>His</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down, and <hi>theirs</hi> with Him, than this viſit to <hi>Acraham;</hi> as it preſently appeared. For as <hi>Abraham</hi> bro't them on their way after their courteous viſit was over, the LORD ſent the <hi>two Angels</hi> on their way to <hi>Sodom,</hi> to deliver righteous <hi>Lot</hi> and to <hi>burn</hi> up the cities of that polluted plain; But he ſtopt ſhort Himſelf, and told <hi>Abraham</hi> how great <hi>the cry of the ſin of Sodom</hi> was before him. Then <hi>Abraham ſtood before the LORD, and drew near to him,</hi> and made, that moſt awful and reverend <hi>Interceſſion</hi> for mercy on the wicked place, which will be famous in the Church for ever; And the LORD granted him his petition till he could not preſume to ask further. And then the LORD went his way, and <hi>Abraham</hi> returned to his place.</p>
                  <p>The mean while the heavenly <hi>Meſſengers</hi> reached <hi>Sodom,</hi> and found as we all know, and the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002853_0018_0FE677DE5F5D4C00"/>the <hi>LORD rained brimſtone and fire from the LORD out of heaven.</hi> Gen. 19.24. The <hi>Lord the SON</hi> rained the fire from the <hi>Lord the FATHER,</hi> who worketh by the <hi>Son.</hi> It was not the <hi>two Angels</hi> that rained the fire; No, It was the LORD who ſtood with <hi>Abraham</hi> when <hi>theſe</hi> went on their way. It was the <hi>Lord CHRIST,</hi> and He did it from the <hi>FATHER,</hi> who hath committed all judgment to him.</p>
                  <p>Here now was my <hi>Text</hi> exemplified in the very <hi>letter</hi> of it. Thoſe burning <hi>coals</hi> of fire which were <hi>ſcattered</hi> over the cities of the valley in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time, came from the hand of the SON OF GOD, the <hi>Man</hi> CHRIST JESUS. That fiery judgment and deſolation, the image of the devouring eternal fire and everlaſting burnings, came from thoſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious arms which had juſt before embrac'd <hi>Abraham,</hi> and all his ſpiritual <hi>Seed</hi> in him. — Go, ſaid the FATHER to Him, <hi>go in between the wheels,</hi> the high and dreadful wheels of my all-governing Providence, and <hi>fill thy hand</hi> with fire and brimſtone, and <hi>ſcatter</hi> it down in a rain of furious <hi>flames</hi> upon the accurſed cities, and <hi>burn</hi> them up together: And it was done.</p>
                  <p>The ſame hand that burnt <hi>Sodom,</hi> the <hi>Alient</hi> from his Covenant, did afterward burn <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the <hi>holy</hi> City.</p>
                  <p>This inſtance alone is a ſufficient <hi>Illuſtration</hi> of my <hi>text,</hi> and a <hi>Demonſtration</hi> of the Truth before us, <hi>That the Judgments of Providence are in CHRIST's hand, and come from Him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I come to a <hi>ſecond</hi> Inſtance, which is the Judgment of GOD upon the wicked <hi>Cananites,</hi> the Nations which GOD rooted out by fire and ſword before the Children of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> I might have nam'd the <hi>plagues</hi> that deſtroyed <hi>Egypt;</hi> for it was CHRIST who appeared to <hi>Moſes</hi> in the buſh on fire and ſent him to <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> But the latter inſtance of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance to <hi>Joſhua</hi> before <hi>Jericho</hi> may ſuffice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002853_0019_0FE677F05DADA800"/>the viſion which he then had ſufficiently tells us from whoſe hand the deſtructions of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and all the Judgments on <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the wilderneſs, had come. For to be ſure the ſame hand that deſtroyed the <hi>Cananites</hi> executed alſo the other judgments.</p>
                  <p>Now the ſtory of CHRIST's appearing to <hi>Joſhua</hi> with the judgments of Providence in is hand, you have in the 5. Chap. v. 13, 14, 15. <hi>And it came to paſs when Joſhua was by Jerico, that he lift up his eyes and looked, and behold there ſtood a MAN over againſt him, with his ſword drawn in his hand, and Joſhua went un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him and ſaid, Art thou for us, or for our adverſaries? And He ſaid, Nay, but as Captain of the Hoſt of the Lord am I now come. And Joſhua fell on his face to the earth and did worſhip, and ſaid unto Him, What ſaith my LORD unto his ſervant? And the Captain of the Lord's Hoſt ſaid to Joſhua, Looſe thy ſhoe from off thy foot, for the place whereon thou ſtandeſt is holy: And Joſhua did ſo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here was a <hi>Man</hi> in form, but <hi>more</hi> than a man, the mighty SON OF GOD himſelf, who afterward took our <hi>fleſh,</hi> and took the name of <hi>Joſhua, JESUS,</hi> a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi> the Captain of our ſalvation. He is the <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> of all the <hi>Lord's hoſts,</hi> in heaven above and on earth below; the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s Lord. He appeared here with a <hi>drawn ſword</hi> in his hand, for the <hi>defence</hi> of his Church and for the <hi>ſlaughter</hi> of their enemies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Joſhua</hi> fell on his face and <hi>worſhipp'd</hi> him, as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> had done in his day with fear and trembling. And becauſe he permitted this, we know certainly that he was no meer <hi>Angel</hi> of God; for then he would have forbid it. But this <hi>Man</hi> in appearance received the profound worſhip of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and requir'd it from <hi>Joſhua,</hi> who fell proſtrate before him with aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful reverence, faith, love, attention and ready obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and ſaid unto Him, <hi>What ſaith my LORD unto his ſervant?</hi> It became him to fall, and ſay thus, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002853_0020_0FE677DE87F7AC40"/>the LORD OF HOSTS and Him only. Juſt as when GOD called to <hi>Moſes</hi> out of the <hi>buſh,</hi> the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant <hi>hid</hi> his face, for he was afraid to look upon GOD.</p>
                  <p>It was the ſame <hi>GOD of Iſrael</hi> who now appeared to <hi>Joſhua</hi> in the form of a <hi>Man,</hi> and had appeared to <hi>Moſes</hi> in the form of <hi>devouring fire.</hi> We know him to be the ſame GOD, becauſe the ſame word of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is given to <hi>Joſhua</hi> that was before given to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Put off thy ſhoe from thy foot, for the place whereon thou ſtandeſt is holy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Doubtleſs as ſoon as <hi>Joſhua</hi> heard theſe words, he knew that it was the ſame LORD GOD whom his maſter <hi>Moſes</hi> had ſeen at <hi>Horeb;</hi> even the <hi>GOD of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, of Iſaac and of Jacob.</hi> See Exod. 3.4, 5.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>why</hi> did He now appear to <hi>Joſhua?</hi> It was to execute <hi>judgment,</hi> the wrath of God upon the nations of <hi>Canaan,</hi> whoſe iniquity was now <hi>full.</hi> He threw down the wall of <hi>Jerico,</hi> and commanded it to be <hi>burnt with fire.</hi> A <hi>ſword</hi> or a <hi>coal</hi> in his hand is the ſame thing. He <hi>fill'd</hi> his hand with judgments, and made <hi>Joſhua</hi> the dreadful executioner of them upon all the devoted nations of that goodly Country. It is the viſion of the ſame JESUS, Revel. 19.13. <hi>with his drawn ſword and veſture dipt in blood,</hi> who will here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after burn the <hi>Romiſh Jerico;</hi> when <hi>all the fowl that fly in the midſt of heaven ſhall be called to the ſupper of the great GOD, to eat the fleſh of Kings and the fleſh of Captains, and of mighty men, and of all men, both bond and free, ſmall and great.</hi> Then the <hi>Cananites</hi> ſhall be a ſecond time rooted out with great fury, and the <hi>Church of GOD</hi> a ſecond time ſhall enter into <hi>reſt,</hi> be enlarged and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. <hi>Even ſo</hi> LORD JESUS <hi>come quickly.</hi>

                  <p>I Go on to a <hi>third</hi> inſtance or <hi>narrative</hi> of CHRIST's appearing with the <hi>Judgments</hi> of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in his hand, namely to <hi>Gideon</hi> againſt the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianites;</hi> Judges 6.12, 13, 14. <hi>And the Angel of the LORD appeared unto him, and ſaid unto him, The LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour! And Gideon ſaid unto him, O my Lord, if the LORD be with us, why then is all this befallen us?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And the LORD looked on him and ſaid, Go in this thy might, and thou ſhalt ſave Iſrael from the hand of the Midianites: Have not I ſent thee?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The LORD looked on him and ſaid, <hi>HAVE NOT ISENT THEE?</hi> If it had not been for <hi>thoſe</hi> words, we might have taken the heavenly Appearance for a common Angel; but from <hi>them</hi> we perceive plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that it was the LORD CHRIST himſelf, the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of the Covenant,</hi> the SON OF GOD, in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And <hi>what</hi> came he for? but to <hi>judge</hi> the enemies of his people, and to ſend <hi>Gideon</hi> to deſtroy them. He commiſſioned him in his <hi>own</hi> name; <hi>Have not I ſent thee?</hi> and inſpir'd him with a look.</p>
                  <p>The Angel is called JEHOVAH, v. 14. <hi>Jehovah</hi> looked on him. I AM ſent him: The ſame <hi>Angel of the LORD</hi> who called to <hi>Moſes</hi> out of the burning <hi>buſh.</hi> He put a <hi>lamp of fire</hi> into <hi>Gideon</hi>'s hand and gave him the <hi>Word, The ſword of the LORD and of Gideon.</hi>— So in all the <hi>Judgments</hi> on the enemies of the Church, in ancient or later times, there has been the hand of CHRIST.</p>

But I come to the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> and mean only to <hi>point</hi> unto a few inſtances, and not enlarge on them.— When our LORD appeared in the fleſh, he ſhew'd that he had the power of <hi>Judgment</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him. The <hi>devils</hi> own'd his power, and beſo't him not to <hi>torment</hi> them before their time. The <hi>Gadarenes</hi> ſaw and felt his power to judge them, when he permitted the <hi>devils</hi> to enter into <hi>the herd of ſwine,</hi> and the whole herd ran violently down a ſteep place and periſhed in the waters. Matth. 8.32. It was an <hi>awful</hi> thing to behold, and and a ſevere <hi>judgment</hi> they thought upon their country. The <hi>diſciples</hi> were ſo ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the power of judgment reſted on CHRIST, that when ſome look'd with diſreſpect on him and would not receive him, they ask'd him, <hi>Lord wilt thou that we command fire from heaven to deſtroy them?</hi> Luke 9.54. But the <hi>Son of man</hi> came not <hi>to deſtroy men's lives, but to ſave them.</hi> It was not the time for <hi>Judgment</hi> when he was here on earth. He us'd this power ſparingly in the days of his fleſh. He <hi>fill'd</hi> his hands with <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>ſcatter'd</hi> it about on all the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable that came in his way.— He had the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of <hi>life</hi> and <hi>death</hi> while he liv'd here, and when he went to die. He ſtruck none <hi>dead,</hi> but he rais'd ſome to <hi>life.</hi> He told <hi>Peter</hi> by what kind of death he ſhould glorify GOD; but when <hi>Peter</hi> ask'd, what ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of <hi>John?</hi> the LORD anſwer'd him in a <hi>ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign</hi> manner, <hi>If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When JESUS was aſcended and glorified he ſhew'd his Church that he exerciſed the power of judgment over men. The death of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phira</hi> was a fearful inſtance of it: And ſo was the blow on <hi>Elima<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> the Sorcerer. Act 13.11.</p>
                  <p>To name no more, The ſecond burning of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> was from the hand of CHRIST. When the <hi>Romans</hi> compaſſed the City, it was <hi>the ſign of the Son of man
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002853_0023_0FE677F56BADA7E8"/>from heaven.</hi> Luke 21.20, 27. Twice hath <hi>the Man clothed with linnen,</hi> the great <hi>High-prieſt</hi> of the Church and <hi>Judge</hi> of the world, <hi>filled his hand with coals</hi> and burnt <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let this ſuffice for the <hi>third</hi> Illuſtration and proof of the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> That the judgments of Providence are in CHRIST's hand. Theſe are ſo many <hi>facts</hi> and inſtances from ſacred <hi>ſtory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">IV. The ſacred <hi>Doctrines</hi> of Chriſtianity do infer and confirm this truth. I will name <hi>two</hi> only, and but name them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The GODHEAD of CHRIST infers this, That the judgments of Providence are in his hand. For can he be GOD and this glory not belong to him? According to thoſe words of GOD concerning Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; <hi>Is there any evil in the city and the LORD hath not done it? See now that I, even I am He, and there is no GOD with me! I kill and I make alive, I wound and I heal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I might argue from the nature, end, extent and duration of the <hi>Mediatorial Kingdom,</hi> that CHRIST is GOD over all, and that all <hi>judgment</hi> is in his hand. The <hi>end</hi> of it is to <hi>recover the elect</hi> of GOD out of that ſtate of <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>miſery</hi> into which they fell by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>'s tranſgreſſion, into a ſtate of holineſs and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs for evermore; and to <hi>execute judgment</hi> (the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of a holy and righteous GOD) upon all ſuch as will not accept of his offered grace, and ſubmit to the terms of his mercy. Now in order to <hi>this</hi> the kingdom, power and rule put into the <hi>Mediator</hi>'s hand muſt be <hi>univerſal</hi> and <hi>everlaſting</hi> as to this world of ours: <hi>all</hi> things muſt be put into his hand and <hi>under his feet,</hi> and he muſt <hi>reign</hi> till all his enemies are made his <hi>footſtool.</hi>— So that whether we conſider CHRIST in his GODHEAD, or in his <hi>Mediatorial</hi> dignity and
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002853_0024_0FE6781850552700"/>offices, the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of Providence and the <hi>Judgment</hi> of Providence muſt be in his hand.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>general Judgment</hi> of the world at the laſt day being committed to CHRIST, neceſſarily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes that the <hi>preſent</hi> judgments of Providence are ſo. That CHRIST is the <hi>Judge</hi> of quick and dead at the great Day, is one of the cleareſt Doctrines of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">See Mat. XXv. 31, 32. Acts XVII. 31. 2 Cor. v. 10. 2 Theſſ I. 7, 8.</note>: <hi>Then the Son of man ſhall come in his glory with all his holy Angels, and before him ſhall be gathered all nations: The Lord JESUS ſhall be revealed from heaven in flaming fire taking vengeance.</hi> The <hi>preſent</hi> judgments of Providence are but previous and preparatory for this <hi>final</hi> Judgment. <hi>That</hi> is but the period and conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of theſe; the laſt and moſt eminent act of his <hi>Regality,</hi> and diſplay of his judicial power; at the cloſe whereof he will ſurrender the Kingdom to the FATHER. 1 Cor. 15.28.</p>
                  <p>Indeed theſe great and ſacred <hi>Doctrines</hi> of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, like Truth which is uniform, do infer and prove one another. If CHRIST be GOD he muſt have the power of <hi>Judgment,</hi> preſent and future. If he have <hi>this power</hi> truly he is the SON OF GOD, and all men muſt honour Him even as they honour the FATHER. Again, If the <hi>preſent</hi> judgments of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence are in his hand, no doubt but he is the <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Judge</hi> in the laſt day: And if the <hi>General</hi> judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be committed to Him, no wonder that the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> executing of judgment is ſo.</p>
                  <p>But this for the <hi>Proof</hi> of the Doctrine: I come to the <hi>Application</hi> and Uſe of it.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>firſt</hi> in a more <hi>general</hi> manner I ſhall <hi>hint</hi> at many things, which in the choice of the Subject I deſigned to have enlarged on; and then <hi>ſecondly</hi> I

                  </p>
                  <p>We have ſeen the united Glories of <hi>Majeſty</hi> and <hi>Holineſs</hi> in the Perſon and Offices of our <hi>LORD Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</hi> We ſee that He is GOD and JUDGE, who is our <hi>Saviour.</hi> We ſee the <hi>evil</hi> (the great evil) of <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>ſinners,</hi> from the terrible Judgments and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that come from the hand of CHRIST himſelf. We ſee that tho' He be <hi>gracious and merciful and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in goodneſs,</hi> yet he will <hi>by no means clear the guilty</hi> and impenitent. We ſee the <hi>reaſon</hi> of the great <hi>pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> forbearance and longſuffering of GOD to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking ſinners; It is CHRIST the <hi>Saviour</hi> who thus waiteth to be gracious to them, <hi>not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance.</hi> We ſee the <hi>ſafety</hi> of believers in the power of Judgment committed to CHRIST; his <hi>Saints</hi> are in one hand while the <hi>burning coals</hi> are in the other: As he took a moſt gracious care of <hi>Lot</hi> in the day of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and as he <hi>marked out</hi> the humble and penitent for Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in my <hi>context,</hi> before he took a <hi>coal</hi> in his hand for the deſtruction of the wicked.</p>
                  <p>If the Judgments of Providence are in CHRIST's hand and come from his hand, <hi>He</hi> then is the object of our <hi>fear,</hi> our <hi>truſt,</hi> our <hi>prayer</hi> and <hi>praiſe.</hi> He is to be <hi>feared</hi> for his power, holineſs, juſtice and goodneſs. <hi>Wilt thou not be afraid of the Power?</hi> He is the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> of GOD to execute vengeance. It is a <hi>fearful</hi> thing to fall into his living hands. The <hi>forgivneſs</hi> which is with him commands our <hi>fear,</hi> for it comes to us in the way of glorious <hi>holineſs</hi> and juſtice. Pſal. 2. ult. <hi>Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling; kiſs the SON leſt he be angry and ye periſh from the way;— Bleſſed are all they that put their truſt in him.</hi>

Again, We may be ſure there is as much <hi>Mercy</hi> in all the judgments of Providence, as is conſiſtent with <hi>rectoral Wiſdom</hi> and righteous <hi>Government.</hi> So it was in the judgment of the <hi>old World,</hi> of <hi>Sodom,</hi> of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites,</hi> and afterward of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And ſo it is in the executions of wrath upon particular <hi>perſons,</hi> while in the afflictions of the <hi>Godly</hi> there is abundance of mercy and love.</p>
                  <p>No wonder that <hi>afflictions</hi> are made <hi>ſaving</hi> to men, means of grace and holineſs to them; ſince the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Providence are in the hand of CHRIST. Why elſe ſhould they be put into the hand of a <hi>holy Saviour,</hi> but to be made bleſſed and effectual means of <hi>ſanctification</hi> and <hi>ſalvation</hi> to ſouls?</p>
                  <p>And no wonder then that we are ſo ſtrictly requir'd to be <hi>patient, ſilent, reſign'd</hi> in all our afflictions; yea <hi>thankful and joyful</hi> in our tribulations. For can a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever acting like himſelf do otherwiſe, when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders every diſpenſation of Providence coming from the ſame merciful hands of CHRIST, which were once ſtretched on the <hi>croſs</hi> and peirced for his ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? He that judges and corrects us is the <hi>LORD</hi> that has loved us and died for us; and ſhall we not with <hi>Aaron</hi> hold our peace? and with <hi>Job</hi> ſtill bleſs his name?</p>
                  <p>And if <hi>death</hi> comes to thee or thine, do we not know that the <hi>key</hi> of it is in CHRIST's hand? He will order for the beſt all that concerns the living and the dying of his choſen and called ones; And what ſhould calm and moderate a Chriſtian's grief like this, "It is CHRIST has done it?</p>
                  <p>But while it <hi>comforts</hi> us it muſt alſo <hi>humble</hi> us, to conſider that our many and great <hi>afflictions</hi> come from the hands of CHRIST. How <hi>awful</hi> is it to a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver on JESUS to think,— Are the judgments of Providence in <hi>His</hi> hand, and I <hi>ſo</hi> judged by him? O how my LORD convinceth me of ſin! how evil am
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:002853_0027_0FE677F8460F6440"/>I in his holy eyes! What have I done to offend and provoke a gracious <hi>Saviour?</hi> how vile and odious are <hi>my</hi> ſins to him, and ſhould be to me! what a corrupt nature have I that needs all this correction! that I muſt be <hi>ſaved ſo as by fire!</hi> O what would have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of me long ago, if the judgments of GOD had been in any other hand but that of my <hi>Lord RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEEMER!</hi> Therefore it is <hi>that I am not conſumed!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Once more O <hi>afflicted</hi> child of GOD, think <hi>whoſe</hi> hand it is that corrects thee: Is it CHRIST's? then it is more and better than any <hi>friend</hi>'s, or <hi>brother</hi>'s, or <hi>father</hi>'s hand: And wilt thou not be in a quiet <hi>ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction?</hi> ſhall we <hi>murmur againſt CHRIST? as they of old murmured, and were deſtroyed by him?</hi> Alas! <hi>they</hi> knew not <hi>the hand</hi> that proved them, as <hi>we</hi> do: <hi>They</hi> ſaw him in <hi>types</hi> and ſhadows, but <hi>we</hi> ſee him in a <hi>Goſpel</hi> light. The <hi>end</hi> of afflictions muſt be very gracious to <hi>Believers,</hi> and the <hi>fruit</hi> of them happy. CHRIST, whoſe care and charge <hi>they</hi> are, will ſee to <hi>this.</hi> It is the very work of a <hi>Saviour</hi> to ſee to it: <hi>Faithful is he that hath called you, who alſo will do it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The majeſty and judgment of CHRIST is only <hi>terrible</hi> to unbelieving and <hi>impenitent ſinners;</hi> and to them it may well be the more terrible to ſee <hi>the wrath</hi> in the face of the <hi>LAMB.</hi> For if <hi>He</hi> judge them, who ſhall pity or ſave them? GOD has put this <hi>honour and majeſty</hi> on him that his <hi>right hand may find out all his enemies, all that hate him:</hi> He will <hi>make them as a fiery oven in the time of his anger;</hi> He will <hi>ſwallow them up in his wrath, and the fire ſhall devour them: Be theu ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted LORD in thy own ſtrength, ſo will we ſing and praiſe thy power.</hi>

                  <p>Chriſt expects that we ſhould worſhip him with great <hi>reverence</hi> becauſe he is our <hi>Judge.</hi> Pſalm. 50.1,—5.99.1,—5.</p>
                  <p>Particularly in the Ordinance of the SUPPER. our <hi>Lord JESUS</hi> exhibits himſelf to us with the <hi>judgments</hi> of Providence in his hand. Read the awful words of this import, 1. Cor. 11.28, — 32. <hi>But let a man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup. For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh JUDGMENT to himſelf, not diſcerning the LORD's body. For this cauſe many are WEAK and SICKLY among you, and ſome SLEEP. For if we would JUDGE our ſelves we ſhould not be JUDGED. But when we are JUDGED we are chaſtened of the LORD that we ſhould not be condemned with the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You ſee that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> is ſpeaking here of <hi>temporal</hi> judgments, which the LORD inflicted on the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> for their ſtrange irreverence and carnality in their participation of the <hi>holy Supper.</hi> They eat and drank <hi>not diſcerning</hi> the LORD's body; therefore they eat and drank <hi>judgment</hi> to themſelves. — But what was the <hi>judgment?</hi> why for this cauſe many were <hi>ſick</hi> and <hi>weak</hi> among them. — And yet as to ſome of them theſe judgments were <hi>not in wrath,</hi> but in <hi>mercy;</hi> For when they were <hi>judged</hi> they were but <hi>chaſtned</hi> of the LORD (to humble and reform them) that they ſhould not be condemned with the would. — Wherefore here was CHRIST, even

                  </p>
                  <p>I come now to that <hi>particular Application</hi> of the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> which the Divine Providence leads me into by the terrible EARTHQUAKE, which we have lately felt with ſo much ſurpriſe and conſternation. And a very natural <hi>Inference</hi> it is, "That if the <hi>Judgments</hi> of Providence are in the hand of CHRIST and come forth from his hand, Then from HIM came the awful warning and <hi>threatning</hi> of Providence to us in the late fearful <hi>Earthquake,</hi> and to HIM we are indebted for the gracious and merciful <hi>preſervation</hi> which we then received. Both the threatning and the preſervation came to us from the holy, mighty, terrible and merciful hand of our <hi>Lord and Saviour JESUS CHRIST. He</hi> ſhook the earth under us in that awful manner, and to that fearful degree, which we lately felt; and <hi>He</hi> kept it from rending and clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving aſunder under us, ſo that we and all that apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to us were not ſwallowed up quick. It ſhould be very <hi>affecting</hi> to us to realize ſuch a <hi>Providence</hi> and diſpenſation as coming from the hand of CHRIST himſelf.</p>
                  <p>HE <hi>the Man clothed with linnen,</hi> with <hi>his hand full of burning coals,</hi> holds the <hi>earth</hi> and the <hi>waters</hi> and the <hi>winds</hi> in the ſame hand; and this Earth of ours never feels any ſhock, convulſion or rending by fires, winds
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:002853_0030_0FE67819C85210E0"/>or waters, from without or from within it ſelf, but as he orders and appoints the ſame. We are expreſly taught concerning CHRIST, That He <hi>upholdeth all things</hi> by the word of his power, and that by Him <hi>all things conſiſt.</hi> Coloſſ 1.14,—17. <hi>In whom we have redemption thro' his blood, even the forgivneſs of ſins: For by Him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth; viſible and inviſible; whether they be thrones or dominions, or principalities, or powers; all things were created by him and for him; And He is before all things, and by Him all things conſiſt.</hi> Hebrews 1.1, 2, 3. <hi>GOD hath in theſe laſt days ſpoken to us by his SON, whom he hath appointed Heir of all things, by whom alſo he made the worlds; Who being the brightneſs of his glory, and the expreſs image of his Perſon, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himſelf purged our ſins, ſat down on the right hand of the Majeſty on high.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus the <hi>Univerſe</hi> is kept together by the SON OF GOD in its proper frame, which it received from Him. "All things <hi>ſubſiſt</hi> in their being, and conſiſt in their <hi>order</hi> and dependencies by his will and word. <hi>In his hand are the deep places of the earth, the ſtrength of the hills is his alſo.</hi> Our earth is held by him in its place and motion, from falling to pieces and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Original <hi>Chaos,</hi> out of which it was bro't into this beauteous and uſeful order of things. — All the <hi>Elements</hi> are in the hand of CHRIST, and tho' contrary and jarring in themſelves, yet there they agree, are ſtill and at peace. <hi>Fire and water, vapour and ſtormy wind</hi> are in abſolute ſubjection and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him, <hi>fulfilling his word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>—And particularly <hi>Earthquakes</hi> proceed from the <hi>burning coals</hi> in his hand, the <hi>ſubterraneous</hi> fires and winds belong to theſe; and he <hi>blows</hi> them up when and where and as he pleaſes, more or leſs in the <hi>caverns</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>THREATNING</hi> of a ſudden and amazing deſtruction to us, in the late moſt <hi>ſerene</hi> night (turn'd into a night of darkneſs and horror to us in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) was from the hand of CHRIST our <hi>Saviour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have <hi>prov'd</hi> this in the fore-going <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> when we little apprehended that CHRIST was coming <hi>ſuddenly</hi> ſo very near to our own doors in a horrible <hi>Earthquake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I told you that it was CHRIST came down to <hi>Sodom,</hi> and rained the <hi>fire (ſcatter'd the coals)</hi> on <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah,</hi> and <hi>Admah,</hi> and <hi>Zeboim,</hi> from the LORD out of heaven. He then alſo <hi>rent</hi> that ground to pieces on which thoſe polluted <hi>Cities</hi> had ſtood, and from the <hi>deep</hi> which lieth under he bro't up a <hi>flood of water,</hi> and quench'd the flames that had burnt up the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and turn'd that once <hi>rich and pleaſant vale</hi> into a ſtanding <hi>filthy lake,</hi> or <hi>dead ſea.</hi> The SON OF GOD came down in the form of a <hi>Man,</hi> (<hi>Abraham</hi> ſaw Him) and executed that <hi>judgment:</hi> The accurſed places <hi>ſunk</hi> under his feet, and a flood roſe and cover'd them from mortal eyes for ever.</p>
                  <p>I have alſo ſaid before how the ſame <hi>Lord CHRIST</hi> came down in the day of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> the fatal day of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed <hi>Jerico,</hi> and produced another <hi>Earthquake,</hi> or what was like it and equal to it. <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſaw a <hi>Man</hi> with his ſword drawn, but he ſound him to be a GOD, with the <hi>fires</hi> and winds of vengeance in his hand, prepared againſt the enemies of his Church and people. The <hi>fire</hi> he put into <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s hand and order'd the devoted City to be <hi>burnt</hi> as ſoon as he ſhould take it; but the ſubterraneous <hi>wind</hi> he kept in
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:002853_0032_0FE6782119D07988"/>the hollow of his <hi>own</hi> hand, and on the <hi>ſeventh</hi> day, at the <hi>ſeventh</hi> compaſſing the city, the <hi>Prieſts</hi> blew with their rams-horns, and <hi>the hand of CHRIST</hi> (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably an <hi>Earthquake</hi> at his ſpecial command) <hi>threw down</hi> the walls of <hi>Jerico</hi> in an inſtant; all but the houſe of <hi>Rahab,</hi> who <hi>by faith</hi> had received his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and protected them.</p>
                  <p>Thus CHRIST was in the Earthquake at <hi>Sodom,</hi> and at the falling of the wall of <hi>Jerico;</hi> and every <hi>other</hi> ſhake of the earth, whether before or after thoſe times, have come from the <hi>ſame</hi> hand.</p>
                  <p>For inſtance, The <hi>earthquake</hi> at the time of <hi>Noah</hi>'s flood (if we may ſo ſpeak) when <hi>the foundations of the great Deep were broken up,</hi> was the Judgment of CHRIST upon the world of the ungodly. It was as much ſo as the <hi>Conflagration,</hi> or the periſhing of the world <hi>by fire</hi> at the laſt day, will be from the <hi>coals</hi> in CHRIST's hand. The ſame <hi>Judge,</hi> and the ſame <hi>Power</hi> and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance which once came by <hi>water,</hi> will hereafter <hi>be revealed in flaming fire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The earthquake at <hi>Sinai</hi> was from the preſence of CHRIST and his immediate hand, who came down then in the glory of the FATHER, as he will do another day, with his holy <hi>Angels,</hi> in devouring <hi>fire,</hi> and <hi>the mount quaked greatly.</hi> Exod. 20.18. The <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots of GOD were twenty thouſand</hi> (even <hi>chariots of fire</hi>) thouſands of <hi>Angels,</hi> and the LORD was among them. The mountain <hi>melted</hi> before Him, even that <hi>Sinai.</hi> Judg. 5.5. The Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> tells us that it was CHRIST's <hi>voice which then ſhook the earth,</hi> who has promis'd ſaying, <hi>Yet once more I ſhake not the earth only, but heaven alſo.</hi> Heb. 12.26.</p>
                  <p>CHRIST was the <hi>LORD GOD of Elijah,</hi> and in the ſpirit of <hi>that Prophet</hi> his Fore-runner came. He came to his <hi>ſervant</hi> once in a <hi>whirlwind,</hi> and in an <hi>earthquake,</hi> and in devouring <hi>fire.</hi> You have the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of this fearful thing, I Kings 19.11, 12.
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:002853_0033_0FE677FED92CAFD8"/>
                     <hi>And behold the LORD paſſed by, and a great and ſtrong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the LORD; but the LORD was not in the wind: And after the wind an earthquake, but the LORD was not in the earthquake: And after the earthquake a fire; but the LORD was not in the fire: And after the fire a ſtill ſmall voice: And it was ſo, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out.</hi> How terrible was this appearance of CHRIST unto his <hi>Prophet?</hi> Who without a divine ſupport could <hi>abide the indignation,</hi> and the tokens of ſo tremendous a <hi>Majeſty</hi> and of the <hi>fierceneſs of his anger? His fury was poured out like fire, and the rocks were thrown down by him.</hi> (To apply here the majeſtic words of the Prophet <hi>Nahum.</hi>) —But how is it ſaid, <hi>That the LORD was not</hi> in the rending wind or earthquake? <hi>Who</hi> was in it, but the <hi>LORD</hi> himſelf? — It means not that the ſpecial and immediate hand of CHRIST was <hi>not</hi> therein: No, it only means <hi>"That he did not manifeſt his preſence by any diſtinct voice</hi> (the ſmall and ſtill voice of a <hi>Man</hi>) in that wind and fire and earthquake, as he afterward did in the <hi>calm</hi> that ſucceeded. So <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah</hi> beheld the glory of CHRIST, in all the <hi>terrors</hi> of an infinitely holy, powerful, offended Majeſty; and yet in the <hi>ſoft</hi> voice of grace.</p>
                  <p>And thus we have ſeen CHRIST in one <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake</hi> and another in the days of old. And no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then is it that we read of the earth's <hi>quaking</hi> by his power at his <hi>death</hi> and <hi>reſurrection.</hi> Mat. 27.51. <hi>The earth did quake and the rocks rent.</hi> Well might they at the horrid deed, and marvailous event, <hi>the Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixion of the SON OF GOD.</hi> v. 54. <hi>The Centurion and they that were with him, watching JESUS,</hi> (the <hi>guard</hi> at the execution) <hi>ſaw the earthquake, and feared greatly, ſaying, Truly this was the SON OF GOD.</hi> Like trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling ſeiz'd the guard at his <hi>Sepulchre,</hi> Mat. 28.2. <hi>And
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:002853_0034_0FE67821404B5528"/>behold there was a great Earthquake, and the keepers did ſhake and became as dead men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In ſuch majeſty and great terror did CHRIST die and riſe again. The wonder was that the revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>Soldiers</hi> and hardy <hi>keepers</hi> (or rather their <hi>maſters</hi> and rulers) were not ſwallow'd up alive. But <hi>the Son of man came not to deſtroy mens lives, but to ſave them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When he pleas'd afterward to manifeſt Himſelf to his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> by ſhaking the places where they were <hi>worſhipping</hi> him or <hi>ſuffering</hi> for him, it was in token of his <hi>favour</hi> and grace to them.

                  </p>
                  <p>So at the prayers and praiſes of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> in the <hi>priſon,</hi> ſuddenly there was an <hi>Earthquake,</hi> and the <hi>foundations</hi> of the priſon were ſhaken.

                  <p>To add no more on this head: In the Book of the <hi>Revelations</hi> we find the great <hi>Events</hi> of Providence and the mighty <hi>changes</hi> reſpecting the Church of CHRIST and the whole World; which are yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them in the hand of the MOST HIGH, and in his times to be ſhewn <hi>who is the bleſſed and only Potentate, King of kings and LORD of lords;</hi> Theſe changes and events (I ſay) are repreſented by <hi>earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes</hi> as well as by <hi>thundrings and lightnings</hi> &amp;c. CHRIST governs in all theſe concuſſions and revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, theſe <hi>literal</hi> or <hi>figurative</hi> earthquakes; with an immediate hand, order and direction.</p>

As in the <hi>firſt</hi> chapter of that <hi>Book,</hi> it is HE THE SON OF MAN that appears in his majeſty and great <hi>terror,</hi> in the midſt of his Churches, <hi>the ſeven golden Candleſticks;</hi> to ſhow his <hi>ſervant</hi> the things that ſhall be hereafter. And he ſhowed him many terrible <hi>earthquakes,</hi> the emblems of the great and mighty changes which he was bringing upon the earth.</p>
                  <p>At the opening of the <hi>ſixth ſeal,</hi> Rev 6.12. <hi>John ſaw a great Earthquake; and the ſun became black as Sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood, and the ſtars fell to the earth, and the heaven departed as a ſerowl, and every mountain and iſland moved out of their place.</hi> This was but a <hi>viſion;</hi> yet was it a viſion of the <hi>true</hi> power of CHRIST, in the kingdom of <hi>nature,</hi> and over the <hi>nations</hi> of men: And it gives us a fair image of his immediate <hi>agency</hi> and rule in all the revolutions in the <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>moral</hi> world. He that <hi>opens the ſeals</hi> does all the <hi>executions</hi> that follow on them, and ſends the <hi>earthquake.</hi>

                  <p>In the 8th. <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. v. we have a place exactly <hi>parallel</hi> to my <hi>text:</hi> It may be worth our while to <hi>compare</hi> them, and ſee if the <hi>coals of fire</hi> from the altar, and the <hi>earthquake</hi> be not in the ſame hand. — In my <hi>text</hi> the GOD-MAN, <hi>Mediator,</hi> goes in between the <hi>wheels,</hi> and fills his hand with <hi>fire</hi> from between the <hi>cherubims,</hi> and <hi>ſcatters</hi> it over the City. — In the 8th. Chap. of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> after the opening of the <hi>ſeventh ſeal,</hi> CHRIST comes and ſtands at the <hi>Altar,</hi> having a <hi>golden Cenſer</hi> with <hi>much</hi> Incenſe, which He offers with the <hi>prayers</hi> of all ſaints before the <hi>Throne.</hi> v. 3. Here is the <hi>Man clothed with linnen,</hi> CHRIST in his <hi>prieſtly</hi> office and interceſſions. But while He is continually doing this for his ſaints, ſo his viſible Church on earth grows <hi>earthly, worldly,</hi> formal and corrupt; And then (v. 5.) CHRIST (the Angel of the Covenant) takes of the very <hi>ſame fire,</hi> wherewith he offered up his incenſe, and <hi>eaſts of this
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:002853_0036_0FE67823B22B27A8"/>down into the earth</hi> in his holy diſpleaſure and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And what was the <hi>effect</hi> hereof? why imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately <hi>there were voices and thundrings and lightnings and an EARTHQUAKE.</hi> That is to ſay, <q>Such manifeſtations of the <hi>wrath</hi> of GOD, and ſuch ſwift and terrible <hi>judgments,</hi> as bro't on a mighty change of affairs among men:</q> Such a change in the face of <hi>Providence,</hi> and on the face of the <hi>Church,</hi> as <hi>earthquakes</hi> often produce on the face of the <hi>earth,</hi> and upon particular <hi>places</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>I might turn you to <hi>ſeveral</hi> more places in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations of St. John</hi> to the ſame purpoſe, but I will point unto <hi>one</hi> only. We read (<hi>Chap.</hi> 16.17.) of the <hi>ſeventh Angel</hi> his pouring out his <hi>vial</hi> into the air, and there was a <hi>GREAT EARTHQUAKE,</hi> ſuch as was not ſince men were upon the earth, ſo <hi>MIGHTY AN EARTHQUAKE</hi> and ſo great: For the <hi>great City</hi> (the Empire of <hi>Antichriſt</hi>) fell into <hi>three</hi> parts, and the <hi>cities of the nations</hi> (which have given their power to the <hi>beaſt</hi>) fell; and <hi>GREAT BABYLON</hi> came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to remembrance before GOD; and every iſland fled away and the mountains were not found.— A <hi>bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi> earthquake truly! <hi>Lord JESUS</hi> haſten it on! hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and tremendous to bloody <hi>Rome</hi> and the <hi>papal</hi> powers! more eſpecially to <hi>Italy</hi> that ſeat of <hi>ſodomy</hi> and earthquakes! that land of <hi>ſulphur</hi> and ſubterrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>fires!</hi>— And why may not its <hi>fall</hi> be by <hi>literal</hi> earthquakes and eruptions of <hi>ſulphureous</hi> flames? The fiery hand of CHRIST ſhall effect this. See the 18. <hi>Chap.</hi> of the <hi>Revelations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus I have at large ſhown that <hi>Earthquakes,</hi> both proper and figurative, are in the hand of our <hi>Lord JESUS CHRIST,</hi> and come forth from his hand.</p>
                  <p>When therefore in the days of his fleſh he ſpake of <hi>this Sign,</hi> that ſhould foreſhew <hi>the Day of his coming;</hi> whether to judge <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or <hi>Babylon,</hi> or the <hi>World</hi>
                     <pb n="29" facs="unknown:002853_0037_0FE67800F10B9290"/>at the laſt day; He then ſufficiently informed us that <hi>this judgment</hi> was in his hand among others. Mat. 24.7. <hi>There ſhall be earthquakes in divers places,— the beginning of ſorrows.</hi> Luke 21.11. <hi>Earthquakes and great ſigns from heaven.</hi> He will accompliſh <hi>in his times</hi> the things of which he has thus given warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>And now to return unto the <hi>Inference</hi> I am upon: From all that we have heard we muſt needs be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced and ſatisfied, That <hi>the late amaſing Earthquake which viſited us the laſt Lord's-day in the night was ſent to warn us from CHRIST, our king, our lawgiver, our judge and our ſaviour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was <hi>He himſelf</hi> who threatned to derſtoy us, as in a moment. The <hi>earthquake</hi> was from <hi>his</hi> hand, whatever might be the <hi>natural Cauſes</hi> of it; all <hi>which</hi> are alſo in the hand of CHRIST, and he works by <hi>them</hi> as he pleaſes with infinite <hi>foreſight</hi> of men and things, and with an unerring direction. We <hi>need</hi> not, we <hi>ſhould</hi> not look any further, (in a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and practical conſideration of the thing, and a religious improvement of it) than the will and government of CHRIST. This becomes us as <hi>Sinners</hi> that would be awakned, and as <hi>Believers</hi> that deſire to be humbled and edified; and it behoves us to act the part of <hi>ſuch</hi> rather than of <hi>Philoſophers.</hi> They ſearch darkly and uncertainly (however curiouſly and laudably) into the bowels of the earth and the ſecrets of nature; but we have the plain <hi>Goſpel of CHRIST</hi> to look into, and <hi>ſee as in a glaſs the glory of the LORD.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus the <hi>threatning</hi> of a ſudden and a fearful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction coming on us in the terrible earthquake was from CHRIST.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Our PRESERVATION from the threatned deſtruction was from the ſame glorious HAND. The hand that <hi>ſhook</hi> the rod over us could have <hi>ſtricken</hi> with it; he that threatned could eaſily have executed.
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:002853_0038_0FE67823DC8BE838"/>He that ſet the earth a trembling, held it together under us; the ſame hand is mighty to ſave and to deſtroy. <hi>The LORD is our judge, and he ſaves it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are not <hi>two Principles</hi> or powers, as ſome of the fooliſh <hi>Heathen</hi> conceived; the one the author of the <hi>evil,</hi> the other of the <hi>good</hi> that comes to the children of men: No, the living and only true GOD is the author of <hi>both; A juſt GOD and a Saviour.</hi> Iſai. 45.7. <hi>I form the light and create darkneſs, I make peace and create evil; I the LORD do all theſe things</hi> — And the <hi>meaſure</hi> of every judgment is from him; the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of it and period to it. He that ſays to the <hi>ſea</hi> hitherto thou ſhalt come and no further, and here ſhall thy proud waves be ſtayed; he ſays the ſame to every <hi>overflowing ſcourge</hi> and overwhelming evil. He <hi>calls to contend</hi> by one judgement and another, and again he ſays— <hi>This ſhall not be.</hi> Amos 7.6.</p>
                  <p>CHRIST ſits upon the floods, and rides upon the winds, and reigns King for ever; Abſolute, Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, irreſiſtible and unaccountable. His blood is the cement that binds the fabrick of heaven and earth together. The earth and its inhabitants were <hi>diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,</hi> but he came and holds up the <hi>pillars</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>The ground had ſwallow'd up <hi>Adam</hi> in the day of his fall, if it had not been for this <hi>SEED of the Woman,</hi> this <hi>IMMANUEL, GOD with us.</hi> Our fallen <hi>parents</hi> heard immediately why they did not <hi>inſtantly die,</hi> and return to their ground; Namely, becauſe there ſhould <hi>a Child be born, a Son be given</hi> them, who ſhould be <hi>the Mighty GOD, the Prince of peace,</hi> on whom the <hi>Government</hi> ſhould be laid. It was for the ſake of this glorious <hi>Bleſſing</hi> in the loins of <hi>Adam,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of an <hi>election of grace</hi> given to Him by the <hi>FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER,</hi> that the <hi>Curſe</hi> did not immediately <hi>devour</hi> the ſinner and his <hi>earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As ſoon as the <hi>Angels</hi> ſinned the heavens <hi>rent</hi> under them, and they <hi>fell</hi> (O mighty fall!) from the height
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:002853_0039_0FE67806DD280510"/>of heaven down into the deep Abyſs of hell, into the bottomleſs pit. The reaſon was, <hi>CHRIST took not the nature of Angels,</hi> took not <hi>hold</hi> of them as they fell. He took the ſeed of <hi>Adam,</hi> and therefore the earth rent not under him; the pit did not ſwallow him up as it did <hi>the angels that ſinned,</hi> for whom there is no redemption.</p>
                  <p>CHRIST has been the Saviour of all <hi>thoſe</hi> that have eſcaped in one deſtroying <hi>earthquake</hi> and another ſince the world began.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>flood,</hi> when the <hi>foundations of the great deep</hi> were <hi>broken up,</hi> CHRIST ſaved <hi>Noah</hi> and his family: <hi>He</hi> gave him <hi>faith,</hi> provided him an <hi>Ark,</hi> ſhut him up in it, ſet it gently afloat, held and ſteer'd it in that boyſterous ſea (that fury of the waters) without a rudder or a ſail, and ſoftly reſted it (without an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor to caſt out) on the mountains of <hi>Ararat.</hi> Well therefore did <hi>Noah</hi> bring his <hi>ſacrifices</hi> to his Deliverer, when he came forth from the <hi>Ark,</hi> ſo many <hi>types</hi> of that <hi>Death</hi> from whence come all our <hi>ſalvations.</hi>— Who ſet the <hi>bow</hi> in the sky, and gave it to <hi>Noah</hi> as the token of his <hi>Covenant?</hi> but HE who afterward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in viſion to <hi>Ezekiel</hi> as a <hi>Man upon the throne, with the bow as in the day of rain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To go on, When <hi>Lot</hi> was ſaved from the fire and earthquake, it was CHRIST himſelf came down, and ſent his <hi>angels</hi> to his houſe: If he had found but <hi>ten</hi> ſuch righteous ones, he would have ſpared the place for their ſakes.— Again, When the wall of <hi>Jerico</hi> fell, <hi>faith</hi> ſaved <hi>Rahab</hi> and her houſe. And when <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhall fall CHRIST will call his people out of her. Revel. 18.4.</p>
                  <p>The ſame <hi>Lord JESUS</hi> ſaved <hi>us</hi> and our families, our lives and our limbs, our dwellings and ſubſtance, in the day when he lately ſhewed us his power, his anger and our deſerts. As he reach'd out his arm to
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:002853_0040_0FE6782B9F6F5530"/>
                     <hi>Peter</hi> when he ſunk on the waters, and cried to him, <hi>LORD ſave me;</hi> ſo his everlaſting arms were under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath our tottering houſes, and they neither ſunk nor fell. <hi>The foundations of the earth moved and were ſhaken,</hi> and in our <hi>diſtreſs</hi> we <hi>cried to him</hi> as our GOD; <hi>He bowed the heavens and came down, he rode upon a Cherub and did fly, yea he did fly upon the wings of the wind.</hi> Pſalm 18.7, 10.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, The inference is ſtrong and obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, That if the <hi>judgments</hi> of Providence are in the hand of CHRIST, ſo are the <hi>mercies</hi> thereof equally from his all-governing hand; many and great and various as they are. All the <hi>preſervations</hi> which are new every moment, all the <hi>deliverances</hi> which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in times of <hi>ſeen</hi> dangers and great hazards, all the <hi>ſupplies</hi> by which we are ſuſtained from day to day and fed from year to year, <hi>they</hi> all come to us from the hand of our <hi>Lord JESUS,</hi> and we ought to receive them as from <hi>Him</hi> with our religious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments of truſt and dependance, prayer and praiſe.</p>
                  <p>We have our perſonal and family mercies, which are exceeding <hi>precious;</hi> and there are the common and publick mercies to the Church and people of GOD together, which are <hi>greater</hi> than thoſe; The <hi>publick</hi> ſhares in the goodneſs of Providence to every private perſon, and <hi>every one</hi> ſhares in the general goodneſs of Providence to the publick; the <hi>glory</hi> of all belongs to CHRIST, and to Him we muſt <hi>ſing</hi> both of the mercy and the judgment.</p>
                  <p>The ſame hand that fed <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the wilderneſs and puniſhed them there, feeds and judges the <hi>Church</hi> ſtill. Believers muſt know and conſider that it is the death of CHRIST has purchas'd for them the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon favours and bounties of Providence; in which they ſhould taſte his covenant love, <hi>taſte and ſee that
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:002853_0041_0FE67807032A45B0"/>the LORD is gracious:</hi> And ſinners muſt know that they are indebted to CHRIST, for all that they have of preſent good things, which ſhould lead them to repentance.</p>
                  <p>Is <hi>Peter</hi> in priſon, or <hi>Paul</hi> in the ſtorm, it is JESUS that ſends his <hi>Angel</hi> to them; or if <hi>Eneas</hi> be ſick, JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST maketh him whole.</p>
                  <p>And thus we have ſeen both the <hi>Threatning</hi> of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the <hi>Salvation</hi> from it in the hand of CHRIST. What <hi>both</hi> demand from us may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in the next <hi>Diſcourſe.</hi>

I. The <hi>threatning</hi> in the terrible earthquake, and the <hi>preſervation</hi> from a ſudden deſtruction by it, do both of them call aloud upon us to <hi>repent and turn from all our ſins, and that inſtantly and earneſtly with fear and trembling.</hi> This is the voice of the aſtoniſhing <hi>judgment</hi> and this the voice of the wondrous <hi>mercy</hi> and deliverance.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Repentance,</hi> inſtant earneſt and deep repentance, is the loud voice of CHRIST to us in the <hi>judgment</hi> and ſudden deſtruction, with which we were threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. The earth <hi>trembled</hi> under our ſins, and <hi>roar'd</hi> under the burden and weight of them. The <hi>ſhake</hi> bro't our <hi>ſins</hi> quick to remembrance, and threatned us with a ſwift and irreſiſtible deſtruction, without giving us any ſpace for repentance, or the asking mercy. And if it was CHRIST the lover of ſouls who threatned us in a manner ſo very dreadful; then ſurely there are very great and diſmal ſins with us againſt our <hi>LORD REDEEMER.</hi> As <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid in the caſe of the <hi>rebels in Iſrael,</hi> Num. 16.30. <hi>If the LORD make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth and ſwallow them up, with all that appertain to them, and they go down quick into the pit; then ye ſhall underſtand that theſe men have provoked the LORD.</hi> And as the prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> teaches us, Iſai. 24.5. <hi>The earth is DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FILED under the inhabitants thereof; becauſe they have tranſgreſſed the law, changed the ordinances, broken the everlaſting covenant; therefore hath the CURSE devoured the earth: Therefore the LORD maketh the earth empty, maketh it waſte, and turneth it upſide down:</hi> v. 19, 20. <hi>The earth is clean diſſolved, the earth is moved exceedingly; the earth ſhall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved like a Cottage; and the tranſgreſſion thereof ſhall be heavy upon it, and it ſhall fall and not riſe again.</hi> This <hi>conviction</hi> of ſin an Earthquake brings with it, and this <hi>call</hi> to humiliation and repentance. It cries to
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:002853_0043_0FE678091B341C80"/>us, as <hi>the wall of the tower of Siloam</hi> did to the ſinners of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Luke 13.5. <hi>Except ye repent ye ſhall all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe periſh.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>When the <hi>jailor</hi> had felt the earthquake, and yet was not devoured by it, <hi>he ſprang in trembling</hi> and ask'd, <hi>What muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi> ſcil. from ſin and the wrath of GOD!

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>deſtroying Angel</hi> has paſs'd thro' every <hi>Town,</hi> and thro' every <hi>ſtreet,</hi> and cried at every <hi>door; RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PENT, REPENT!</hi> every <hi>perſon,</hi> every <hi>family,</hi> every <hi>age order</hi> and <hi>degree</hi> of men! <hi>Sanctify</hi> your ſelves and your houſholds to the LORD, leſt he <hi>break</hi> forth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you! <hi>Sanctify</hi> your ſelves every one <hi>upon his own ſins,</hi> his moſt beloved ſin! ſmite upon <hi>thy own</hi> breaſt, feeling the <hi>plague</hi> of thy heart, and ſay <hi>What have I done!</hi> and <hi>ſigh</hi> and cry for the ſins of <hi>others,</hi> that the <hi>mark</hi> of GOD may be ſet upon thee, before the <hi>coals of fire</hi> be ſcattered down.</p>

                  <p n="2">II.

Such are the ſin and wickedneſs of the <hi>Old World,</hi> of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the holy City, and of <hi>Babylon</hi> which now is.</p>
                  <p n="1">1.

A deluge of iniquity and impiety firſt covered the face of it, and then came the flood of Divine wrath which tore it to pieces. Gen. 6.5, 11, 12. <hi>GOD ſaw that the wickedneſs of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the tho't of his heart was only evil continually: And it repented the LORD that he had made man upon the earth, and it griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him at his heart: And he ſaid I will deſtroy Man, whom I have created, from the face of the earth: — The

Nor was it <hi>this</hi> place, or that, which was ſo vile and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon'd, but every place and people. <hi>Noah</hi> alone was found righteous before GOD, and he only was faved with his houſe. <q>When wickedneſs is become general and <hi>univerſal,</hi> ruine is not far off: While there is a remnant of praying people in a nation or countrey to empty the meaſure as it fills, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may be kept off a great while; But when all hands are at work to pull down the fences of ſin, and none ſtand in the gap to make up the breach, What can be expected but an <hi>Inundation</hi> of wrath?</q> So Mr. <hi>Henry.</hi>

                  <p>We may obſerve that in the day of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and of the <hi>Cananites,</hi> and of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſo of <hi>Babylon,</hi> a <hi>general corruption</hi> brings on the deſolation. <hi>This</hi> GOD warns againſt by every <hi>earthquake.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. The ſins of <hi>Sodom</hi> come firſt in order of time and degree of impiety in the <hi>new</hi> world. The <hi>cry</hi> of their <hi>grievous</hi> ſin was <hi>great</hi> before CHRIST, and an <hi>earthquake</hi> devoured them. The fire of <hi>luſt</hi> burnt among them in a rage and flame that reach'd up to heaven, and bro't down fire and brimſtone on them; made them a <hi>hell</hi> above ground, and then the <hi>pit</hi> ſwallow'd them up. Intemperance and luxury was their ſin, pride and idleneſs, and <hi>lewdneſs</hi> in ſuch a kind and exceſs as has left the name and brand of <hi>Sodomy</hi> on the unnatural luſt forever.

<pb n="39" facs="unknown:002853_0047_0FE6780D9F8415B0"/>and Eph. 4.19. <hi>Who being paſt ſeeking, have given themſelves over to work all uncleaneſs with greedineſs.</hi> When they ſaw but a beauteous <hi>Angel</hi> in the form of a man they were for <hi>knowing</hi> him; to ſatisfy their worſe than <hi>brutiſh</hi> luſt upon him. And ſo <hi>furious</hi> was their luſt, and ſo <hi>general</hi> the contagion, that before bed-time <hi>they compaſſed the houſe round, both old and young, all the people, from every quarter,</hi> threatning <hi>Lot</hi> if he did not render up his lovely gueſts to them. No like example of <hi>impurity</hi> has been known on the earth, and therefore theſe <hi>are ſet forth for an example, ſuffering the vengeance of eternal fire.</hi> Jude. v. 7. When the like promiſcuous and inceſtuous mixtures were found in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> there came an earthquake in the days of <hi>Amos:</hi> Amos. 1.1. and 2.7. An <hi>Earthquake</hi> therefore comes to convince of and warn againſt the ſins of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and every tendency thereunto.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The ſins of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> alſo, the <hi>holy city</hi> by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and covenant obligations, are bro't to mind when GOD viſits his profeſſing people with an <hi>earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Prophet <hi>Zechariah</hi> remembers the remnant of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> how their <hi>Fathers fled before the Earthquake in the days of King Uzziah.</hi> Zech. 14.5. <q>The <hi>Jews</hi> have a tradition, that it hapned juſt at the time when <hi>Uzziah</hi> preſumptuouſly invaded the prieſt's office, and went in to burn incenſe.</q> 2 Chron. 26.16. If it were ſo it would lead us alſo to think of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion of <hi>Corah</hi> and the preſumption of his <hi>aſſociates;</hi> Num. 16.

                     <hi>horrible</hi> one which put them into a very great terror. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and <hi>Amos</hi> were the LORD's prothets in thoſe days. <hi>Amos</hi> dates his Prophecy <hi>two years before the Earthquake.</hi> He warn'd them of it before it came. The ſins of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> at that time provoked the LORD to ſend the earthquake. And what <hi>their ſins</hi> were may be gathered from <hi>theſe prophecies;</hi> from the whole of <hi>Amos,</hi> and from the <hi>five</hi> firſt Chapters of <hi>Iſaiah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſins of <hi>Sodom</hi> were among them: Amos. 2.7. <hi>A man and his father will go in to the ſame maid, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane my holy name.</hi> Vile and filthy <hi>inceſt,</hi> equal to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt any of the Abominations of the heathen. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Iſaiah</hi> began his prophecy with that ſevere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke and reproach, <hi>Hear the word of the LORD, ye ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of Sodom; give ear to the law of our GOD ye people of Gomorrah.</hi> Such was the <hi>vine</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> become, and ſuch their <hi>grapes</hi> and <hi>cluſters;</hi> and <hi>except the LORD of Hoſts had left a very ſmall remnant, they would have been as Sodom and Gomorrah</hi> in their puniſhment; over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown like them.</p>
                  <p>Their ſins were numerous, multiplied, repeated and perſiſted in; there were <hi>three tranſgreſſions and four</hi> among them before the judgments came: Amos. 1.4. They were <hi>laden with iniquity.</hi> Iſai. 1.4. They ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt great <hi>light</hi> and many <hi>means</hi> of grace, which inhaunc'd their guilt and haſten'd on the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Amos. 3.2. <hi>You only have I known of all the families of the earth, therefore I will puniſh you for all your iniquities.</hi> They <hi>corrupted</hi> religion which they had received pure and undefiled in the word of GOD; they confounded <hi>moral</hi> good and evil, Iſai. 5.20. and mixt the worſhip of GOD and the <hi>calves</hi> together. Amos. 4.4. They were <hi>worldly, panting after the duſt of the earth,</hi> Amos. 2.7. weary of their <hi>Sabbaths and new moons,</hi> and wiſhing them <hi>over,</hi> that they might ſet forth their <hi>wheat</hi> and ſell corn: Amos. 8.5. They
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:002853_0049_0FE6780DC671CF90"/>were for <hi>joyning houſe to houſe, and laying field to field, that they might be plac'd alone in the earth.</hi> Iſai. 5.8. They were <hi>unjuſt,</hi> unrighteous and oppreſſive, both in their <hi>private</hi> dealings and in their <hi>Courts</hi> of juſtice<note n="†" place="bottom">Amos 2.6. 3.10. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>2. 6.12.</note> 
                     <hi>They ſold the righteous for ſilver, and the poor for a pair of ſhoes: they turned aſide the way of the meek: They ſhored up violence and robbery in their palaces, and know not to do right: They afflicted the juſt, they took a bribe, and turned aſide the poor in the Gate: Theſe were their manifold tranſgreſſions and mighty ſins: They turned judgment into gall, and the fruit of righteouſneſs into hemlock! They ſwallowed up the needy and made the poor of the land to fail: They made the Ephah ſmall, and falſified</hi> the weights and <hi>ballances:</hi> For theſe things <hi>the Land was made to tremble, and the earth was darkned in the clear day, and their houſes were ſmitten, the winter houſe and the ſummer houſe together.</hi> Amos. 3.15. <hi>Iſaiah</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſai. 1.21,—27. 3.14, 15. 5.23.</note> brings the ſame charges againſt them, and mentions it as a <hi>ſcarlet and crimſon ſin</hi> that they did not <hi>ſeek judgment, relieve the oppreſſed, judge the fatherleſs and plead for the widow;</hi> but <hi>every one loved gifts, and followed after rewards; Therefore the Mighty One of Iſrael ſaid, Ah, I will eaſe me of my adverſaries and avenge me of my enemies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All this was done under a <hi>form</hi> of Godlineſs, a profeſſion and <hi>ſhew</hi> of religion, and this render'd it much the more ungodly and vile. Under a high pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of devotion and obedience they were thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous, prſane and impious. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> therefore asks them <hi>to what purpoſe the multitude of their ſacriſices</hi> were? and bids them <hi>bring no more vain oblations:</hi> for their <hi>incenſe was an abomination,</hi> and their very <hi>Sabbaths</hi> an <hi>iniquity.</hi> And <hi>Amos</hi> tells them the ſame, Amos 5.21. <hi>I hate, I deſpiſe your feaſt days, and I will not ſmell in your ſolemn aſſemblies,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>take away from me the noiſe of your
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:002853_0050_0FE6783200E1FB90"/>ſongs,— but let judgment run down as water, and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs as a mighty ſtream.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This corruption was <hi>general,</hi> Iſai. 1.4, 6. <hi>The nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was ſinful,</hi> they were <hi>a ſeed of evil deers, children that were corrupters; from the ſole of the foot even to the head there was no ſoundneſs, but wounds and bruiſes and putrifying ſores.</hi> They were bold and impudent in ſin, <hi>declaring it as Sodom:</hi> Iſai. 3.9. They were proud and haughty in their attire, <hi>the dau'ters of Sion walked with ſtretched forth necks and wanton eyes, mincing and tinkling with their feet:</hi> but they were told that the <hi>LORD would take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments, and their round tires like the moon:</hi> Iſai. 3.18.</p>
                  <p>They were <hi>fearleſs</hi> of judgments, and would not <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve</hi> them when they came; they derided GOD's <hi>threatnings,</hi> and ſinned on after all his warnings: <hi>GOD overthrew ſome of them</hi> as he had <hi>Sodom and Gomorrab, and they were as a brand plucked out of the burning; yet would they not return</hi> unto him. Amos 4.11. They <hi>roſe up early in the morning to follow ſtrong drink, and continued</hi> at it in the evening <hi>till wine inflamed them; The harp and viol, the tabret and the pipe were in their feaſts; but they regarded not the work of the LORD, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſidered the operation of his hand:</hi> Iſai. 5.11, 12. <hi>They drew iniquity with cords of vanity and ſinn'd as it were with a cart-rope; They ſaid, Let him make ſpeed, and haſten his work that we may ſee it;</hi> believing and fearing nothing of it; <hi>They caſt away the law of the LORD of Hoſts, and deſpiſed the word of the Holy One of Iſrael.</hi> v. 18, 19, 24. <hi>They put far away the evil day, and cauſed the ſeat of violence to come near.</hi> Amos. 6.3.</p>
                  <p>This was the ſtate and theſe the ſins of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> when they were viſited of the <hi>LORD of Hoſts</hi> with the earthquake in the days of <hi>Uzziah.</hi> And the <hi>Earthquake</hi> that has lately viſited <hi>us</hi> warns us from GOD of any <hi>tendencies</hi> among us to the ſame
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:002853_0051_0FE678604724B470"/>iniquities. And in whatſoever degrees they are <hi>found</hi> among us, it calls aloud upon us to <hi>repent</hi> and turn from them with fear and trembling. For <hi>ſhall I not viſit for theſe things? ſaith the LORD.</hi> As the ſinners in <hi>Iſrael</hi> fled at the cry of their ſinking brethren, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>leſt the earth ſwallow us up alſo!</hi> ſo ought we at the <hi>roar</hi> of an earthquake to fear and fly from thoſe ſins for which GOD hath ſometimes viſited his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. —It remains that I juſt mention,</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And laſtly, The ſins of <hi>Babylon</hi> which now is, the <hi>Romiſh Babylon.</hi> She is ſpiritually called <hi>Sodom,</hi> and is like to periſh by earthquake and fire. <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> are eminently her ſins; but luſt and ſodomy, pride and idleneſs, every abomination and filthineſs, corporal and ſpiritual, are found with that <hi>mother of harlots.</hi> The <hi>blood of the ſaints</hi> is found in her; and great will be her <hi>fall:</hi> Even as if we ſaw <hi>a mighty Angel take up a great milſtone, and caſt it into the ſea. Thus with violence ſhall that great City Babylon be thrown down, and ſhall be found no more at all. Her ſins reach to heaven, and ſtrong is the LORD GOD that judgeth her.</hi> Revel. 18. init.</p>
                  <p>By every <hi>ſhake</hi> of the earth GOD ſays to his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi> people, <hi>Partake not of her ſins that ye receive not of her plagues.</hi> So he ſaid of <hi>old Babylon,</hi> Jerem. 51.6. <hi>Flee out of the midſt of her, and deliver every man his ſoul: Be not cut off in her iniquity; for this is the time of the LORD's vengeance.</hi> So the <hi>Angels</hi> ſaid to <hi>Lot</hi> in the laſt night of <hi>Sodom,</hi> Gen. 19.12. <hi>Haſt thou here any beſides? ſon or daughter? bring them out of this place; for the LORD hath ſent us to deſtroy it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus I have briefly pointed out <hi>thoſe ſins and ſinners</hi> which GOD has ſometimes puniſhed, or threatned to puniſh with <hi>earthquakes.</hi> Let us be afraid of ſuch kind and degrees of ſin. Let our <hi>fleſh tremble for fear of
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:002853_0052_0FE67834D00A00B8"/>GOD and let us be afraid of his judgments.</hi> Let us <hi>depart from the tents of theſe wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, leſt</hi> we <hi>be conſumed in all their ſins.</hi> Should we <hi>join in affinity with the people of theſe abominations, would not GOD be angry with us, and conſume us</hi> with them? — Yet how many of <hi>their</hi> ſins are there with <hi>us</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the LORD? for which the righteous GOD has been awfully <hi>threatning us.</hi> We remain <hi>eſcaped</hi> this day, and the <hi>Lord our GOD is righteous!</hi> it becomes us to humble our ſelves and ſay with <hi>Ezra; Behold we are before thee in our treſpaſſes, and we cannot ſtand before thee becauſe of this</hi>

                  <p n="3">III. The <hi>Earthquake</hi> that viſited us, and wherein we have been mercifully <hi>preſerved</hi> by CHRIST not only meant to awaken <hi>greater Sinners</hi> to repentance, but <hi>all</hi> and every one, even the <hi>leaſt</hi> of ſinners. The ſhake was <hi>common</hi> to all; the greater and the leſs, elder and younger, godly and ungodly; and <hi>awful</hi> to all, awakning to all.

                  <p>Thus CHRIST came in the <hi>earthquake,</hi> as he will hereafter in the <hi>judgment day,</hi> to <hi>convince all that are
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:002853_0054_0FE67834F20A68D8"/>ungodly of their ungodly deeds and hard ſpeeches;</hi> yet to ſoften and take away the <hi>heart of ſtone,</hi> and to break the <hi>rock</hi> in pieces. The wicked are harder than the earth and ſtones if they are not moved and ſhaken and broken under ſuch a providence; harder than the cruel hearts of the inraged mob and magiſtrates at <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippi,</hi> who when they had ſorely beaten <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi> and thruſt them into the dungeon, yet when the <hi>earthquake</hi> came at night they were ſo terrified and convinced of their unrighteous act, that as ſoon as it was day they ſent and releaſed them; yea came themſelves and beſo't them and brought them out of priſon. And well might "<hi>their Conſciences make furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reflections</hi> on them for what they had done, when they came to conſider that they had uſed the <hi>Men of GOD</hi> ſo barbarouſly only for caſting the <hi>devil</hi> out of a poſſeſſed <hi>damſel;</hi> and when GOD had <hi>ſhook</hi> the City, made the ground to tremble, at their horrid deed.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>ſecondly, Leſſer</hi> ſinners ſhould be awakned and much affected at a terrifying <hi>earthquake,</hi> as well as greater ſinners. And indeed <hi>theſe</hi> are more likely to hear and fear, and receive inſtruction. The impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſion enters the eaſier and deeper on a <hi>tender</hi> heart. In what a fright were our <hi>Children</hi> and young people, many of them, when they heard and felt the <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake?</hi> how did they <hi>run</hi> to the preſence and arms of their helpleſs <hi>Parents,</hi> and attend to their <hi>prayers</hi> in that hour of conſternation? what <hi>gracious words</hi> did many of them ſpeak to their pious Parents at that time? And how were <hi>all that fear GOD</hi> affected with his hand, humbled under it and the more penitent before him? The <hi>men of GOD</hi> did, like <hi>Moſes,</hi> fear <hi>exceedingly;</hi> were afraid of his <hi>fierce</hi> anger. Like <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> they were moved for the ſouls and bodies of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for the godly and for the wicked, for <hi>Lots houſe</hi>
                     <pb n="47" facs="unknown:002853_0055_0FE67861E7B000F0"/>and for every <hi>ſodomite.</hi> Like <hi>Ezra</hi> they rent their hearts for their own and their people's ſins. Like <hi>Joſiah</hi> their heart was tender, and they cried out— <hi>Great is the wrath of the LORD againſt us.</hi> Like <hi>Moſes</hi> they ran into the <hi>gap,</hi> and ſtood in the <hi>breach,</hi> to turn away GOD's anger. And like <hi>David</hi> ſome might <hi>open</hi> their own conſcious hearts to the ſword of juſtice, and ſay, <hi>Upon me LORD let thy hand be,</hi> but ſpare the ſheep of thy paſture.</p>
                  <p>Every gracious heart is tender and <hi>contrite</hi> before GOD, and <hi>trembles</hi> at his voice, whether in his writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Word or ſpeaking Providence: And to every ſuch perſon the <hi>high and lofty One</hi> will look. Iſai. 66.2. Gracious <hi>Elihu</hi> could not ſee the <hi>lightning</hi> of GOD nor hear his <hi>thunder</hi> (things much more common than an <hi>Earthquake,</hi> yet awful like it) but <hi>his heart trembled and was moved out of its place:</hi> Job 37.1. <hi>Hear atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively</hi> (ſays he) <hi>the noiſe of his voice, and the ſound that goeth out of his mouth! He directeth it under the whole heaven,— after it a voice roareth:— Hearken to it, O. Iob: ſtand ſtill, and conſider the wondrous works of GOD.</hi> The beſt of men need to be awakned, and to awake themſelves to a very humble diligent attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the mind of GOD in his wondrous works. And none will hearken to him with like reverence and godly fear as the moſt godly. Like the Prophet <hi>Hab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bakkuk</hi> who <hi>heard GOD's ſpeech and was afraid,</hi> and pray'd, <hi>O LORD in wrath remember mercy.</hi> Hab. 3.16. <hi>When I heard my belly trembled, my lips quivered, rottenneſs enter'd into my bones.</hi> Well might this be, had the <hi>Prophet</hi> been holier than he was; for he ſaw <hi>the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting mountains ſcattered and the perpetual hills bowing</hi> before the Majeſty of GOD.</p>
                  <p>So then under ſuch a diſpenſation as this, of a dreadful <hi>Earthquake,</hi> every ſinner, the <hi>greater</hi> and the <hi>leſs</hi> are loudly called to humiliation and repentance. Surely the <hi>greater</hi> will think the ſhake ſent to <hi>them,</hi>
                     <pb n="48" facs="unknown:002853_0056_0FE6783C133D52D0"/>and ſurely not to them only, but to <hi>me</hi> alſo, will the <hi>leaſt</hi> of ſinners be ready to ſay; Yea <hi>to me the chief of ſinners</hi> will he ſay that is moſt <hi>eminent in grace</hi> and in repentance. — But to go on,</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. The <hi>earthquake</hi> came and CHRIST <hi>preſerv'd us in it</hi> to awaken us to an inſtant flight to <hi>Him</hi> as the <hi>Refuge</hi> of our ſouls, the rock and <hi>tower of ſalvation</hi> to us. <hi>The name of the LORD is a ſtrong tower, the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous runneth into it and is ſafe.</hi> Prov. 18.10.

The <hi>Man clothed with linnen</hi> ſays to us, <hi>Look unto me and be ye ſaved all ye ends of the earth.</hi> The <hi>coals</hi> in his hands muſt <hi>haſten</hi> our flight to him. We muſt flee unto him to <hi>hide</hi> us. He will <hi>cover</hi> us with his ſpotleſs robe, and not a <hi>ſpark</hi> from the coals ſhall fall on us.

How gladly then ſhould we <hi>gather</hi> to him, to the <hi>covert</hi> of his wings. Pſal. 57.1. <hi>Be merciful unto me O GOD, be merciful unto me, for my ſoul truſteth in thee; Yea in the ſhadow of thy wings will I make my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge until theſe calamities be overpaſt.</hi> There is no ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for us <hi>now,</hi> at <hi>death,</hi> nor in the day of <hi>judgment,</hi> without an intereſt in CHRIST by faith.

The deſign of the preached Goſpel, and the end of mercies and of judgments, is to lead ſinners to him.

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus the <hi>Earthquake,</hi> and our preſervation in it by the hand of CHRIST, ſhould haſten our <hi>flight</hi> to <hi>Him</hi> as the <hi>refuge</hi> of our ſouls; with faith, fear, love, prayer, praiſe, and ſelf conſecration. We ſhould
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:002853_0060_0FE6783D9B741F38"/>be very ſolemn, fervent, deliberate and yet ſpeedy in this perſonal tranſaction with the great GOD.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. FAMILY-RELIGION is a very ſpecial duty which the earthquake and our preſervation in it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhes us of and calls us to. The threatning was to <hi>families</hi> and the preſervation was of them. Our <hi>houſes</hi> were ſhaken, and yet ſpared. They might have cruſh'd and buried us. CHRIST's voice to us is ſerve me in your houſes; and our anſwer ſhould be that, Joſh. 24.15. <hi>As for me and my houſe we will ſerve the LORD.</hi> Our houſholds and our ſubſtance ſhould be bro't under a renewed conſecration to CHRIST, and have HOLINESS TO THE LORD written on them. The walls and <hi>ſtones</hi> of our houſes in a manner <hi>cried</hi> to us as they ſeem'd falling, and they may <hi>cry out</hi> againſt us if the fear and worſhip of GOD be not always in them for time to come.</p>
                  <p>CHRIST calls us to repent of and reform our <hi>family ſins,</hi> and that <hi>we put iniquity far from our taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</hi> Job. 22.23. And he warns us to make more conſcience of family and <hi>relative duties.</hi> For inſtance, FAMILY INSTRUCTION; according to the command of GOD Deut. 6.6, 7, 8. <hi>And theſe words which I command thee this day ſhall be in thy heart, and thou ſhalt teach them diligently unto thy children; and ſhalt talk of them when thou ſitteſt in thy houſe, and when thou lieſt down and when thou riſeſt up.</hi> FAMILY-WOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SHIP is another duty which the preſervation of our dwellings and houſholds demands of us: family <hi>prayer</hi> and <hi>praiſe</hi> morning and evening, together with the reading GOD's word. Shall there be any <hi>prayerleſs families</hi> among us, or prayerleſs <hi>perſons</hi> and <hi>cloſets</hi> in any family, after ſuch a ſhake of our houſes? GOD forbid. Read the righteous and terrible Imprecation or curſe that hangs over ſuch irreligious houſes, Jer. 10.25. <hi>Pour out thy fury upon the heathen, and upon
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:002853_0061_0FE6786A009F12A8"/>the families that call not upon thy name.</hi> Say not it means the families of falſe worſhip and <hi>Idolatry</hi> in the heathen nations; for grant it — yet thy houſe <hi>(O Chriſtian)</hi> is worſe in GOD's ſight than any <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> if CHRIST be not daily worſhipt in it. Carry thy houſe daily to <hi>him</hi> to be <hi>ſprinkled</hi> with his blood, <hi>the blood of the paſſover,</hi> that the <hi>Angel of death</hi> may not ſmite it. Let our ſpared dwellings be <hi>Bethels,</hi> for GOD to be <hi>worſhipt</hi> in, for him to <hi>dwell</hi> in. And let the preſence of CHRIST in them, with the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and ſalvations of Providence in his hand, be awfully apprehended by us in daily family worſhip. As <hi>Jacob</hi> wak'd in the morning and ſaid, <hi>How dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful is the place! it is the houſe of GOD and gate of heaven.</hi> And that CHRIST may come under our <hi>roof,</hi> and bring <hi>ſalvation</hi> with him as he did to the houſe of <hi>Zaccheus,</hi> let FAMILY-GOVERNMENT be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and maintained among us. When GOD threatned our houſes lately, did he not in effect ſend us the meſſage which he did once to <hi>Eli, Tell him that I will judge his houſe, for that when his ſons made themſelves vile he reſtrained them not.</hi> And now that GOD has preſerv'd our houſes and houſholds, ſhould we not reſolve and pray and ſing with <hi>David,</hi> Pſalm. 101. <hi>I will ſing of mercy and of judgment, unto thee O LORD will I ſing: I will behave my ſelf wiſely in a perfect way; O when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my houſe with a perfect heart; I will ſet no wicked thing before my eyes; I hate the work of them that turn aſide, it ſhall not cleave to me:— He that walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in a perfect way he ſhall ſerve me; he that worketh deceit ſhall not dwell within my houſe; he that telleth lies ſhall not tarry in my ſight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover,</p>
                  <p>Not only ſhould Heads of families, but <hi>children</hi> and <hi>ſervants</hi> alſo, be greatly aw'd and affected with the threatning and ſalvation of GOD's providence. Be

                     <hi>ſubject</hi> to your parents, to your maſters and miſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as unto CHRIST. Eph. 6.6.

There is a parental as well as a paſtoral <hi>watch,</hi> and it is for your <hi>ſouls, as thoſe that muſt give an account, that they may do it with joy and not with grief.</hi>— In a word, We read of <hi>the voice of ſalvation and rejoicing in the taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles of the righteous:</hi> So let it be with <hi>us;</hi> The voice of <hi>ſalvation</hi> and rejoicing is in our dwellings, let them be the tabernacles of the <hi>righteous.</hi>

                  <p>Let thoſe that live in an eaſie and careleſs neglect of the holy <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of CHRIST, for themſelves or their children, remember how the <hi>Angel</hi> of the LORD met <hi>Moſes</hi> in the <hi>Inn</hi> and threatned to ſlay him, for his omitting to <hi>circumciſe</hi> his ſon. Exod. 4.24, 25. <q>
                        <hi>Omiſſions</hi> are ſins, and muſt come into judgment, and particularly the neglect and contempt of the <hi>ſeals</hi> of the Covenant; for it is a ſign we undervalue the <hi>promiſes</hi> of the Covenant, and are diſpleas'd with the <hi>conditions</hi> of it.</q> So Mr. <hi>Henry. Moſes</hi> inſtantly humbled himſelf, and put the mark of GOD upon his ſon, and the <hi>angel of death</hi> departed from him.</p>
                  <p>Some think <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſtruck with a <hi>mortal ſickneſs</hi> in the Inn, and GOD let him know that it was for his neglecting to circumciſe his child. And we know the threatning of GOD in the day when he gave the law of Circumciſion to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 17.14. <hi>The uncircumciſed man-child— that ſoul ſhall be cut off from my people, he hath broken my covenant.</hi> The threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning had like to have been executed on the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>parent</hi> for his omiſſion.</p>
                  <p>Let thoſe alſo fear the <hi>judgments of CHRIST</hi> who <hi>never</hi> came to his <hi>Table,</hi> or come <hi>unworthily</hi> thereunto. Are the <hi>judgments of Providence in his hand?</hi> and has he ſaid, <hi>This do in remembrance of me?</hi> and will he not judge men for their <hi>Omiſſion</hi> of this duty? Or has he ſaid again, <hi>Let a man examine himſelf and ſo let him eat
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:002853_0064_0FE67845D7D30790"/>of that bread and drink of that cup; for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh judgment to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf?</hi> and ſhall we not <hi>judge</hi> our ſelves that we may not be <hi>judged?</hi> We know how the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were judged for their <hi>irreverence,</hi> 1. Cor. 11.30. <hi>Many were ſick and weak</hi> among them, and <hi>ſome</hi> died. Judge then, (and ſurely the <hi>coals</hi> in the hand of CHRIST call us to judge our ſelves) Whether there is not a general faulty <hi>neglect</hi> of the <hi>Table</hi> of <hi>CHRIST</hi> among us? And whether there be not much <hi>unworthy eating and drinking</hi> found with us? — Should not the loud and terrible threatning of judgment bring <hi>both theſe</hi> to a ſerious conſideration with us? — Surely CHRIST calls many among us to his long neglected <hi>Table,</hi> that his houſe may be full; and I hope is bringing many to it by the awful alarm which he has given them. And ſurely he calls all his <hi>Churches</hi> to a more reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend obſervation of <hi>this,</hi> and every <hi>other</hi> of his Infti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions. Let us remember how <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abibu,</hi> as well as <hi>Corah,</hi> died with their <hi>cenſers</hi> in their hands; and what the HOLY ONE ſaid thereupon, <hi>I will be ſanctified in them that draw nigh me.</hi> Very awful al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo is his threatning, Levit. 26.14, 15. <hi>If ye will not bearken to me, and will not do all theſe Commandments; if ye ſhall deſpiſe my ſtatutes, and if your ſoul abhor my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and you break my covenant; I alſo will do this unto you, I will even appoint over you terror.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">VII. And laſtly, By the terrible <hi>threatning</hi> and the merciful <hi>preſervation</hi> in the late amazing <hi>Earthquake,</hi> CHRIST warns us <hi>to get ready for his Coming;</hi> for death, judgment and eternity. Is it not a <hi>ſign</hi> to us of the <hi>Son of man,</hi> how quickly and ſuddenly he may come? Is it not a warning to us to get ready for it? Mat. 24.42. <hi>Watch therefore, for ye know not what hour your LORD doth come: Therefore be ye alſo ready, for in ſuch an hour as you think not the ſon of man cometh:
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:002853_0065_0FE678722FDC1728"/>Bleſſed is that ſervant whom his LORD when he cometh ſhall find ſo doing.</hi> Luke 12 35, 36. <hi>Let your loins be girded about and your lights burning, and be ye as men that wait for their LORD, to open unto him immediately.</hi> Is not this the meaning of his <hi>threatning, "Or I will come upon thee quickly?</hi> and this the language of his <hi>ſparing mercy, "Bleſſed is he that watcheth and keepeth his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Surely CHRIST meant to give us a very ſenſible conviction of the <hi>vanity and emptineſs of this world</hi> and all the enjoyments of it; and to raiſe our <hi>affections</hi> to and fix them on <hi>the things that are above, where He is at the right hand of GOD?</hi> O what did <hi>this</hi> world and life and all the things of it ſeem to us, while the earth was ſhaking and as it were ſinking under us! So let us always look on it as a periſhing thing, and far from being any portion for an immortal Creature. 1. John. 2.17. <hi>The world paſſeth away and the luſts thereof, but he that doeth the will of GOD abideth for ever.</hi> Col. 3.3. <hi>Set your affections on things above, and not on things upon the earth; for ye are dead and your life is hid with CHRIST in GOD; When CHRIST who is your life ſhall appear then ſhall ye alſo appear with him in glory</hi>
                     <note n="‖" place="bottom">Mat. 6.19. 1. Cor. 7 29, — 31.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us realize it, that there is a more terrible <hi>ſhake</hi> before us, than that which ſo lately terrified us; even DEATH! which with a cold but ſtrong hand will ſhake our ſouls out of our bodies. And what will it avail us that we have been delivered from an <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake</hi> now, if a few days hence the pit below, <hi>the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs pit,</hi> open its mouth upon us and ſwallow us up? What will it avail us that CHRIST grants this <hi>ſpace for repentance,</hi> if after a hard and <hi>impenitent heart</hi> we only treaſure up <hi>wrath</hi> againſt the day of wrath! When it ſhall be <hi>more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah</hi>
                     <pb n="58" facs="unknown:002853_0066_0FE67845F96AE210"/>than for us; and they that went down <hi>quick</hi> into the pit ſhall <hi>riſe up in judgment</hi> againſt us and condemn us! What will it ſignify to us that the <hi>Earth</hi> did not ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low us up three weeks agoe, if the day is coming upon us hereafter when we ſhall <hi>cry to the rocks and mountains to fall upon us and hide us from the face of the LAMB!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſinners of the <hi>Old world,</hi> on whom the Long, ſuffering of GOD waited in the days of <hi>Noah,</hi> tho' they periſhed by a <hi>flood</hi> of water for their impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, will fare <hi>better</hi> in the day of judgment than <hi>Goſpel ſinners.</hi> And the wicked <hi>Sodomites,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the warnings of <hi>Lot</hi>'s righteous and grieved ſoul from day to day, tho' they periſhed by <hi>fire</hi> here, yet will hereafter find a more <hi>tolerable</hi> place in hell than Goſpel ſinners. And the ſinners of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that had ſuch a <hi>Vengeance</hi> taken of them in the firſt and ſecond deſtruction of that famous City, yet will be leſs miſerable than <hi>we</hi> in the day of judgment, if we periſh in their ſins. For the <hi>records</hi> of their ſins and of their Judgment is written for our <hi>warning;</hi> and a <hi>Greater</hi> than <hi>Noah</hi> or all the <hi>Prophets</hi> has ſpoken to us from heaven; and we have ſeen Him with <hi>the judgments of Providence</hi> in his hand and with the <hi>eternal Judgment</hi> alſo committed to Him; and at the ſame time he <hi>invites</hi> us to repentance by all the tenders and arguments of <hi>Grace</hi> that can poſſibly be made to us; Wherefore of how much <hi>ſorer puniſhment</hi> ſuppoſe ye muſt <hi>we</hi> be tho't worthy, both in this world and in that to come, if we go on impenitently in thoſe ſins for which they periſhed? <hi>Hebrews.</hi> 10.26; — 31.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>THIS <hi>Chapter</hi> is fill'd with <hi>lamentation and mourning and woe.</hi> The <hi>burden of the whole earth</hi> it may be called. For tho' it doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs refers more immediately to the <hi>ravages and deſolations</hi> made far and near by the ſword of the <hi>Aſſirian,</hi> or the <hi>Babylonian</hi> armies; yet it may ſeem alſo deſigned to repreſent and bewail the <hi>general Curſe</hi> which <hi>ſin</hi> has bro't upon the world of mankind.</p>
                  <p>It begins thus, <hi>Behold the LORD maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waſte, and turneth it upſide down;— the land ſhall be utterly emptied and utterly ſpoiled;— the world languiſheth and fadeth away;— the earth is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; becauſe they have tranſgreſſed the law, changed the ordinance, broken the everlaſting covenant: Therefore hath the Curſe devoured the Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is GOD's <hi>curſe</hi> that is here ſpoken of; what He has uttered, and which he inflicts. The <hi>ſubject</hi> of this curſe is the <hi>Earth</hi> whereon Mankind dwell: <hi>That</hi> &amp;c its inhabitants are under the curſe. The <hi>cauſe</hi> of the curſe is <hi>Sin,</hi> and the holy wrath of GOD which
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:002853_0070_0FE67847293B5BE0"/>it provokes. The <hi>curſe</hi> is the threatning of the law, the righteous puniſhment of ſin. The <hi>nature</hi> of the curſe is deſcribed here from the terrible <hi>effects</hi> of it, its <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring the Earth.</hi> This makes the <hi>Curſe,</hi> namely, its devouring and deſtructive nature.</p>
                  <p>This is according to the <hi>threatning of GOD</hi> and his Judgment paſs'd on <hi>Adam, Curſed is the ground for thy ſake.</hi> This became the glory and holineſs of the infinite GOD, the Maker and Sovereign of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct. That the Curſe of the great GOD is come upon the Earth for Man's ſin, and hath devoured it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is the <hi>Curſe</hi> of the great and holy GOD. <hi>Behold the LORD maketh the Earth empty,</hi> &amp;c. He only hath a <hi>right</hi> to curſe, and he alone has <hi>power</hi> to do it. To <hi>Him</hi> it belongs to <hi>curſe</hi> and to <hi>bleſs,</hi> and whom he bleſſeth are bleſſed indeed, and his curſe is effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual and takes place. Pſalm 94.1. <hi>O LORD God to whom vengeance belongeth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He made the earth <hi>good</hi> and bleſſed it: he made <hi>man</hi> holy and happy and bleſſed him. The curſe is of <hi>our ſelves,</hi> we bro't it on the earth. GOD is the ſame bleſſed, holy, good and wiſe Being, when he curſeth as when he bleſſeth. There is <hi>no ſhadow of change</hi> in Him. The change is in <hi>us:</hi> We conſtrain the infinitely pure, wiſe and righteous ONE to judge thus.</p>
                  <p>What then is the <hi>Curſe</hi> of GOD? It is the holy Anger and Wrath of ALMIGHTY GOD threatned againſt and inflicted on ſinful creatures.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is the <hi>Anger,</hi> wrath and vengeance of GOD in the <hi>Curſe.</hi> Nahurn 1.2. <hi>GOD is jealous and the LORD revengeth; the LORD revengeth and is furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; the LORD will take vengeance on his adverſaries, and he reſerveth wrath for his enemies.</hi>
                  </p>

2. GOD's <hi>threatned</hi> wrath in his <hi>Word,</hi> that is the Curſe to <hi>man. The law worketh wrath.</hi> We had not known the <hi>curſe</hi> but by the <hi>law,</hi> which <hi>curſeth every one that continueth not in all things written in</hi> it, <hi>to do them.</hi> Gal. 3.10. The <hi>threatning</hi> belongs to the <hi>Law,</hi> and contains the <hi>curſe.</hi> Deut. 11.26, 28. <hi>Behold I ſet before you this day a bleſſing and a curſe; a Bleſſing if ye obey the Commandments of the LORD your GOD; a Curſe if ye will not obey.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The threatned wrath of GOD <hi>inflicted</hi> is the <hi>Curſe.</hi> The curſe hath <hi>devoured,</hi> ſays the <hi>Text.</hi> GOD hath performed, and is executing the Threatnings of his Word. It is the <hi>Execution</hi> that gives force and terror to the <hi>Law;</hi> this makes the curſe ſeen and felt and feared. Mal. 4.6. <hi>I come and ſmite the earth with a Curſe.</hi> So ends the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> the miniſtration of the Law. — Thus the <hi>Curſe</hi> is GOD's righteous and terrible wrath, threatned in his word and inflicted by his power.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. The <hi>curſe</hi> is come upon the <hi>Earth</hi> for <hi>Mans ſin.</hi> The <hi>ſubject</hi> and <hi>cauſe</hi> of the curſe is pointed to in the <hi>text, Therefore</hi> hath the curſe devoured the earth. It was threatned by GOD in caſe of <hi>ſin,</hi> it was inflicted upon the ſin of <hi>man.</hi> Sin provokes GOD to curſe, ſin highly deſerves his curſe, and only ſin merits and procures it. Sin bro't it on the head of <hi>Angels,</hi> and they beguiled man into it.</p>
                  <p>There was <hi>no</hi> curſe upon the <hi>Earth</hi> till man had ſinned: No, but it was full of <hi>bleſſings.</hi> It was all a <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> crowned and fill'd with the bounties of GOD. Every thing on it was <hi>very good,</hi> and the <hi>LORD bleſſed it.</hi> It was a ſeat of happineſs, a garden of <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi> while it remained a place of <hi>holineſs.</hi> But as <hi>by one man ſin enter'd into the world,</hi> ſo <hi>Death by ſin.</hi> Rom. 5.12. The <hi>ourſe</hi> is a train of dreadful evils pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding <hi>death,</hi> and conſequent upon it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="66" facs="unknown:002853_0072_0FE6784750F60698"/>
The earth belong'd to the <hi>ſinner,</hi> and therefore is the <hi>curſe</hi> come upon it. GOD made the earth for the ſake of his Creature <hi>Man,</hi> and gave it to him for his poſſeſſion and dominion. And for mans ſake GOD curſed the earth, becauſe it belong'd to the ſinner. See Gen. 3.17, 18, 19. He yet gives par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular places up to the curſe, <hi>for the iniquity of them that dwell therein.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>paradiſaic</hi> face of the earth paſs'd away with man's innocence and integrity. It was not fit that the ſinner ſhould remain in <hi>Eden:</hi> No, he muſt be <hi>driven out with a flaming ſword.</hi> If he be ſtill continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon earth that muſt be changed, to become a place of affliction and pain to him. By ſin he <hi>forfeited</hi> the good, with which GOD had filled the earth, and he was deprived thereof. By ſin he <hi>deſerved</hi> pain, grief and vexation, and the earth was made to miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it unto him. So he came by <hi>the knowledge of evil</hi> after the Good, by a ſad ſenſe and feeling of it. He ſaw and felt the change without, as well as within himſelf; and that it was <hi>an evil and bitter thing</hi> that he had ſinned.</p>
                  <p>GOD valu'd not the <hi>Earth</hi> in compariſon of <hi>Man,</hi> the owner of it, and his <hi>obedience.</hi> GOD had made him in his <hi>Image,</hi> with much <hi>ſolemnity</hi> and a divine <hi>pleaſure.</hi> GOD had prepar'd and ſtock'd the earth for him, before he made him. GOD <hi>put it under man's feet,</hi> but reſerv'd man's heart and ſoul for Himſelf and for heaven. The ruine of <hi>Man</hi> was therefore more to GOD, than if the whole earth and all the creatures in it could have periſhed without him. A <hi>ſoul</hi> in the likeneſs of GOD, an immortal <hi>ſpirit</hi> capable of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, loving, ſerving and enjoying GOD for ever, is more than ſeas and lands, fiſh and fowl, beaſts and all cattle. What ſhall be given to GOD, what hath not <hi>he</hi> given, in exchange for a ſoul?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="67" facs="unknown:002853_0073_0FE6787A62E797B8"/>
The <hi>Inhabitant</hi> is greater than the <hi>houſe</hi> he dwells in. <hi>The things that are made,</hi> however great in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, are yet <hi>leſs</hi> at laſt than the <hi>Perſons</hi> for whom they are made. The earth may well <hi>diſſolve</hi> with its inhabitants.</p>
                  <p>But at laſt, the <hi>Glory and honour of GOD</hi> is in value infinitely beyond <hi>Man</hi> and his <hi>Earth</hi> together. <hi>Pereat mundus, ſed fiat juſtitia:</hi> Let GOD be glorified, tho' the earth periſh and man with it. GOD has caſt down <hi>Angels,</hi> and he will burn up <hi>Worlds,</hi> rather than bear with <hi>ſin,</hi> or let it go <hi>unpuniſhed.</hi>

It is meant 1. of the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> of the Earth, 2. of <hi>that</hi> it ſelf, and 3. of the <hi>good and happineſs,</hi> peace and comfort that would have been, or that is yet in the world.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Curſe is now <hi>devouring,</hi> and thro' every ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of man has been devouring, the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> of this earth in that <hi>one</hi> vaſt and comprehenſive part of it, <hi>Mortality and death.</hi> This is the very <hi>letter</hi> of the Curſe, in the firſt and ſhort (but O how exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive!) <hi>compendium</hi> of it; <hi>In the day when thou eateſt thou ſhalt ſurely die.</hi> That is to ſay, become mortal and miſerable.</p>
                  <p>Number if you can the families and generations of men that have proceeded from the loyns of <hi>mortal. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam:</hi> Where are <hi>they?</hi> what is become of every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that have belonged to them? The <hi>Curſe</hi> (that is <hi>Death</hi>) hath ſlain and devoured them all! the grave has eat 'em up! Unſatisfied death, and the inſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able grave, which never ſays it hath enough.</p>
                  <p>How many millions of people <hi>die</hi> in every age of the world? not one of theſe had died but for the <hi>curſe!</hi> What is become of all theſe <hi>buried bodies?</hi>
                     <pb n="68" facs="unknown:002853_0074_0FE6784DF667AC60"/>Death and the worms (that is, the Curſe) has <hi>devour'd</hi> them; <hi>into duſt they are conſum'd away.</hi> Like a thing devour'd they are turn'd into corruption.</p>
                  <p>They that have liv'd to fifty or ſixty year old have almoſt ſeen that Generation devour'd which fill'd the earth when they came into it; and this <hi>dragon</hi> ſtands ready to devour every child of man that is yet to be born.</p>
                  <p>We read of <hi>death</hi> as the devourer, Pſal. 49.14. <hi>Like ſheep they are laid in the grave, death ſhall feed on them.</hi> Prov. 1.12. <hi>Let us ſwallow them up alive as the grave, and whole as they that go down into the pit.</hi> Hab. 2.5. <hi>Death cannot be ſatisfied, but gathereth unto him all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and heapeth unto him all people.</hi> Thus Death is the Curſe which devoureth the earth.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. There are <hi>many Plagues</hi> which belong to death and the curſe, by which the earth has been and ſtill is devoured. The curſe is a quiver full of deadly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, ſome whereof are ever on the ſtring, and flying every moment, directed at the heart of one or other of the ſons and daughters of men. It is a vaſt col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of many woes, and every one of them makes vaſt deſtructions. You have them in part enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the 28. of <hi>Deuteronomy; All theſe curſes ſhall come upon thee and overtake thee; Curſed ſhalt thou be in the city and curſed in the field; curſed ſhall be thy basket and thy ſtore; curſed the fruit of thy body and of thy land, the increaſe of thy kine and of thy ſheep; curſed ſhalt thou he when thou comeſt in and when thou goeſt out.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The world had an <hi>Epitomy</hi> of the Curſe in the plagues of <hi>Egypt,</hi> thoſe ten plagues which devour'd that ſerrile Country. Again we have the branches and terrors of the Curſe in the <hi>ſeven laſt plagues,</hi> the vials of the wrath of GOD: Revel. 15.1. <hi>And I ſaw another ſign in heaven great and marvellous, ſeven Angels, having the ſeven laſt plagues; for in them is filled up the
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:002853_0075_0FE6787BE9D0E520"/>wrath of GOD.</hi> 16.1. <hi>And I heard a great voice out of the Temple, ſaying to the ſeven Angels, Go, pour out the vials upon the earth.</hi> Here is the <hi>viſion</hi> of the Curſe; beyond the words of men and beyond their fears.</p>
                  <p>I will ſingle out and name <hi>ſome</hi> of theſe <hi>plagues</hi> and curſes, which devour the Earth; whereof <hi>how little a part</hi> is known by us, and how little can the <hi>leaſt part</hi> be deſcribed by us.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>War</hi> is one part of the Curſe; one cruel and woful thing whereby it has devour'd the earth. From the days of <hi>Nimrod</hi> it has been ravaging and devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſlaying its thouſands and ten thouſands, laying waſte Cities and Provinces. One devouring <hi>Beaſt</hi> and another have been the true <hi>Images</hi> of war. So the ſucceſſive <hi>Monarchies</hi> and <hi>Tynannies</hi> are repreſented in the book of <hi>Daniel.</hi> Such a devouring beaſt was the <hi>Aſſirian</hi> firſt; and then the <hi>Babylonian Empire;</hi> and ſuch the <hi>Grecian</hi> Victors, <hi>Alexander</hi> and his <hi>Captains;</hi> and then the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> which ſwallow'd up all in its turn; till at laſt it <hi>prey'd</hi> upon it ſelf and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a <hi>morſel</hi> to barbarous nations. And thus the ſword goes on devouring for ever: The deſtructions are perpetual and never like to come to an end. Death and the curſe have even ſubſiſted upon the wars, which have murder'd the nations of men. The labours and fruits of the field are the leaſt part of its devouring; It makes <hi>its arrows drunk with blood,</hi> and <hi>the ſword devours fleſh.</hi> Would you ſee the Earth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd? you have it, Dan. 7.23. <hi>And the fourth beaſt ſhall devour the whole earth, and ſhall tread it down and break it in pieces.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>peſtilence,</hi> that inviſible ſword of death, <hi>which walketh in darkneſs,</hi> is another <hi>form</hi> of the Curſe which devours the earth. If <hi>war</hi> has ſlain its thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> have their ten thouſand. Who can number the hoſts of the various kinds of mortal ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:002853_0076_0FE7519D32BAA9F0"/>and diſtempers, to which our bodies are here liable? How many millions of lives do they ſilently ſweep away every day and week. The plague in the camp of <hi>Iſrael</hi> carried off in an <hi>hour</hi> 14700 ſouls; and in one <hi>night</hi> the Angel of death ſlew in the <hi>Aſſirian</hi> Camp 184000. In <hi>three days</hi> peſtilence GOD can kill as many, as in <hi>three years</hi> famine, or in <hi>three months</hi> flying before an enemy. Deut. 28.22. <hi>Every ſickneſs and every plague ſhall he bring upon thee, until he have conſumed thee.</hi> I ſuppoſe <hi>that</hi> threatning to be more than literally fulfilled from age to age, Ezek. 5.12. <hi>A third part of thee ſhall die by the peſtilence:</hi> i. e. by ſickneſs of one kind and other. So the wrath of the <hi>Almighty</hi> in the deſtruction of the lives of men is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, Hab. 3.5, 6. <hi>Before him went the peſtilence and burning coals</hi> (i. e. Fevers) <hi>at his feet: And he ſtood and meaſured the earth:</hi> i. e. gave over ſuch a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the lives upon it to the peſtilence: <hi>I heard</hi> (adds the Prophet) <hi>and my belly trembled, and rottenneſs enter'd into my bones.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Famine</hi> and the cauſes of it are another part of the curſe which devours the earth. The numbers that die of famine are not equal to thoſe that die in <hi>war,</hi> or by <hi>ſickneſs.</hi> It would be dreadful if it were ſo: for better it is to die of <hi>theſe</hi> than of that. There are troops of plagues to introduce a famine; the land is devour'd before it comes. The <hi>lean kine</hi> and the <hi>blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ears,</hi> devouring the fat and the <hi>rank ſtalk,</hi> is the <hi>rueful image</hi> of this plague. <hi>Drought</hi> or ſweeping <hi>rains</hi> devour the earth and <hi>leave no food. The fire devours the paſture, and the flame burns up the trees of the field.</hi> Joel. 1.19. Again <hi>the ſeed rots under the clods</hi> by exceſs of rain, <hi>and the garners are laid deſolate: Alas for the day! for as a deſtruction from the Almighty ſhall it come! how do the beaſts groan, and the cattle are perplexed!</hi> If GOD ſend the <hi>locuſt,</hi> or the <hi>caterpillar,</hi> or <hi>worms</hi> of various kind, they ear up every green thing. Theſe
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:002853_0077_0FE64591B05CFF28"/>he calls the <hi>devourer:</hi> Mal. 3. II. A moſt proper name truly, and very formidable. Pſalm. 105.34.35. <hi>He ſpake and the locuſts came, and caterpillars without number; and did eat up all the herbs of their land, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd the fruit of their ground.</hi> 2. Chron. 7.13. <hi>If I ſhut up heaven and there be no rain, or if I command the locuſts to devour the land.</hi> A very ſignal part of the curſe, <hi>Famine</hi> in all the cauſes of it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Earthquakes, ſtorms</hi> and <hi>inundations</hi> belong to the Curſe which devours the earth. The <hi>LORD has his way</hi> in theſe, and they are dreadful executioners of his wrath and holy vengeance. They are irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deſtroyers, before which there is no ſtanding and oppoſing, and from which there is no flying. The <hi>earthquake</hi> ſwallows up all before it, and the fierce <hi>wind</hi> bears down all before it, and the <hi>inundation</hi> rolls over all that ſtands in its way. Nahum. 1. init. <hi>The LORD hath his way in the whirlwind, and in the ſtorm, and the clouds are the duſt of his feet: — The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth is burnt at his preſence; yea the world and all that dwell therein: Who can ſtand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fierceneſs of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down by him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The earth was devour'd in the days of <hi>Noah</hi> by earthquakes and inundations; The earth ſank, and <hi>the fountains of the great deep were broken up.</hi> In like manner the plains of <hi>Sodom</hi> were turned into a ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding water. This <hi>overflowing Scourge</hi> is ever in the hand of GOD, Pſalm. 18.7, —12. Iſai. 29.6. And every year almoſt we hear of ſome threatnings or executions of the <hi>Curſe</hi> after this kind, which ſhould GOD increaſe and multiply how ſoon would the earth be <hi>devoured</hi> by it? — Thus there are <hi>many plagues</hi> which belong to the curſe, and which devour the earth.</p>
                  <p n="3">

III. The curſe has once already devoured the whole earth by a <hi>flood of waters,</hi> and will devour it again by <hi>fire,</hi> in the <hi>Conflagration</hi> at the laſt day. <hi>Twice</hi> will the Curſe effect a univerſal diſſolution of the earth. <hi>One woe is paſt</hi> long ſince, and the <hi>other cometh quickly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>Flood</hi> devoured the Earth in the days of <hi>Noah,</hi> and it was the <hi>Curſe</hi> of GOD for the ſins of mankind that did it. So it is at large related to us in the <hi>ſixth</hi> and <hi>ſeventh</hi> Chapters of <hi>Geneſis.</hi> It is compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>learned men,</hi> that there might then be living on the earth as great a number of people as are alive upon it at this day, by reaſon of the <hi>Longevity</hi> before the flood: But however that were, yet we muſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe many Millions of men women and children then drown'd together. They ſank by ſhoals innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. At the ſame time the waters <hi>tore</hi> the ground to pieces, and left it a mighty <hi>ruine,</hi> as its <hi>ſhores</hi> do ſhew at this day. <hi>Then the channels of waters were ſeen, and the foundations of the world were diſcovered; at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke of the LORD, at the blaſt of the breath of his noſtrils. He made darkneſs his ſecret place, and his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the sky.</hi> Pſalm 18.</p>
                  <p>My <hi>context,</hi> as well as <hi>Pſalm</hi> now quoted ſeems to point us to this very Inſtance, <hi>the flood;</hi> for then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it was that <hi>the LORD made the earth empty</hi> (a kind of ſecond <hi>Chaos) and perverted the face of it: It was moved exceedingly, and was clean diſſolved: It reel'd to and fro like a drunkard, and was removed like a cottage:</hi> It ſank under <hi>the tranſgreſſion</hi> of men which was <hi>heavy upon it.</hi> Yet it roſe again by the power and patience of GOD; but bears the unſightly and mortal marks of the Curſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Curſe</hi> will once more devour the earth in
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:002853_0079_0FE6787EF3081E10"/>the laſt <hi>Conflagration,</hi> when the heavens and earth that now are ſhall be burnt up.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Philoſophers</hi> and the <hi>Poets,</hi> both <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> have in their writings preſerved the <hi>tradition</hi> both of the <hi>flood</hi> which has once devoured the earth, and of the <hi>fire</hi> that will again do it. But it is the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> which has taught us to believe it; more eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially thoſe famous words of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.7,—12. <hi>But the heavens and earth which are now, are reſerved unto fire againſt the day of judgment, and perdition of ungodly men:— The day of the LORD will come as a thief in the night, in the which the heavens ſhall paſs away with a great noiſe, and the elements ſhall melt with fervent heat; the earth alſo and the works that are therein ſhall be burnt up.</hi> Here the <hi>end</hi> of the earth by fire is poſitively declared, and it will be a <hi>deluge</hi> of fire. The <hi>means</hi> of it are to us unknown, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our beſt <hi>reaſonings</hi> about it altogether uncertain. Whether the LORD will rain down fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone as he did on <hi>Sodom,</hi> or whether the <hi>fires</hi> within the earth ſhall break forth and pour out mighty ſtreams of flaming ſulphur, or whether ſome awful <hi>Comet,</hi> like that which ſome of us ſaw in the year 1680, paſſing (as that did they ſay) into the flames of the <hi>Sun,</hi> may come <hi>blazing</hi> down upon this wicked Earth of ours, and ſet it in a flame at once. GOD only knows the time and means of this Event, and has them in his power; but the thing is decreed, and in its time will be performed; and the earth will be <hi>devoured,</hi> melted and diſſolved <hi>by the fire of the Divine jealouſie.</hi> Zeph. 3.8. <hi>The Day will burn as an oven, and all that do wickedly ſhall be as the ſtubble.</hi> Mal. 4.1. "The flames will drink up the very <hi>ſea,</hi> ſays a learned <hi>Author,</hi> and run down the <hi>mountains</hi> and <hi>rocks</hi> into burning <hi>Oar.</hi>" And then the <hi>Curſe</hi> will have <hi>devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
                     <pb n="74" facs="unknown:002853_0080_0FE6784F7AC24068"/>the Earth a <hi>ſecond</hi> time; and <hi>there ſhall be no more Curſe for ever</hi>

                  <p n="4">IV. The <hi>latent hidden Curſe</hi> is at laſt <hi>in mens Souls,</hi> their vitiated minds and wild paſſions, their wicked and ungodly luſts, whereby they become <hi>plagues</hi> and <hi>curſes</hi> to one another now, and will be (without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance) <hi>devoured</hi> by the Curſe of GOD in the <hi>Judgment of the great Day.</hi>

                     <hi>One ſinner deſtroyed much good,</hi> ſpoiling himſelf and all about him of all the comfort, happineſs and peace that the Earth has to give. From whence come <hi>wars</hi> which devour the earth? <hi>come they not of mens luſts that war in their members?</hi> their pride, ambition, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, hatred and revenge? What devouring <hi>beaſt of prey</hi> is there in the <hi>woods,</hi> like to a <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> or a <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> among men? — Or what is it that devours the <hi>private</hi> good of perſons, towns, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies and provinces, like mens private gains and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, their envies and emulations, hatreds and wraths? they defraud and oppreſs, <hi>bite and devour</hi> one another, and ſo are <hi>conſumed</hi> one of another. The <hi>plague</hi> is in the <hi>heart,</hi> tho' few <hi>feel</hi> it in themſelves, whereby they become a <hi>curſe</hi> to themſelves and others.</p>
                  <p>And for <hi>this</hi> the <hi>Day</hi> is coming when the Wrath of GOD will devour <hi>ſouls;</hi> the <hi>day of the perdition of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men.</hi> In that fearful day the Curſe will devour <hi>all</hi> that have ever lived upon the earth, ſave a ſmall <hi>remnant</hi> according to the election of Grace.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>eternal</hi> part of the Curſe is emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently <hi>the Curſe.</hi> The outward and <hi>temporal</hi> plagues, how many ſoever they be and dreadful, are as nothing to <hi>that.</hi> A <hi>body</hi> liable to a devouring <hi>grave</hi> is nothing, in compariſon of an <hi>Immortal Soul</hi> in a ſtate of <hi>ſpiritual

                  <p>The <hi>laſt</hi> and <hi>full</hi> execution of the curſe is that <hi>fiery indignation which ſhall devour</hi> the enemies of GOD after the day of Judgment. Then <hi>death and hell,</hi> loſt ſouls and damned devils, ſhall be <hi>caſt</hi> together into <hi>the lake of fire, and the ſmoke of their torment ſhall aſcend for ever and ever.</hi> The Curſe is finally that, Mat. 25. ult. <hi>Depart ye curſed into everlaſting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O how <hi>few</hi> out of the world of mankind will <hi>eſcape</hi> this <hi>devouring fire,</hi> theſe <hi>everlaſting burnings? Lord! are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

He was <hi>a murderer from the beginning,</hi> and ſtill goeth about <hi>as a roaring lion ſeeking whom he may devour.</hi> This is the <hi>great red dragon,</hi> whoſe <hi>tail drew the third part of the ſtars of heaven</hi> after him; and the <hi>Manchild</hi> on earth he <hi>ſtands ready to devour.</hi> Rev. 12.4. He is the <hi>Original of ſin and miſery in both worlds.</hi> What a horrid <hi>face</hi> is this? Draw <hi>this</hi> likewiſe, <hi>That he can never repent.</hi> Let him bear the <hi>curſe</hi> for ever, has the righteous GOD ſaid, who bro't it on the <hi>earth,</hi> and on the lov'd race of <hi>Men.</hi> The utmoſt curſe of <hi>man</hi> is, to depart accurſed to <hi>him.</hi> He muſt anſwer in the day of Judgment, as for his own apoſtacy, ſo for all the ſins and woes that have fill'd this earth of ours. The <hi>Son of man</hi> will judge him in the great day, and revenge upon him this implacable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable enmity to GOD and wrong to man.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. See the <hi>Grace of our Lord JESUS CHRIST,</hi> and the <hi>mercy of GOD thro' him.</hi> O the height and depth of <hi>redeeming love!</hi> how unſearchable is it? Contemplate it in the following things, and be rapt in holy aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment and thankfulneſs.</p>
                  <p>The SON OF GOD has in our nature been <hi>made ſin,</hi> and <hi>born the curſe,</hi> that he might <hi>ſave us from the curſe.</hi> 2. Cor. 5.21. Gal. 3.13. Great is this <hi>myſtery of Godlineſs,</hi> this triumph of <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> united! <hi>the Angels of heaven deſire to look into it!</hi> they look and worſhip (and ſo muſt we) before the <hi>Mercy-ſeat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To CHRIST it is owing that the earth is not <hi>utterly</hi> devoured by the Curſe. It ſtands by his merits; and thro' his obedience and death we ſinners are under the care and bounties of <hi>Providence.</hi> The covenant of Providence is built upon the covenant of Grace,
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:002853_0084_0FE67856DF5485E8"/>and the <hi>rain bow</hi> covers the throne of the <hi>Redeemer.</hi> All the forbearance of GOD to us, and all his ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from day to day, are from his great <hi>propitiation.</hi> Therefore <hi>day and night, ſummer and winter, ſeed time and harveſt do not fail.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nay our Lord JESUS has <hi>deſtroyed</hi> the devouring <hi>curſe</hi> as to all that <hi>believe</hi> in him; and he will <hi>finiſh</hi> the deſtruction of it at his <hi>ſecond</hi> Coming, and in the reſurrection of the <hi>Juſt.</hi> Then he will <hi>ſwallow up death in victory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He delivers <hi>ſouls</hi> from the curſe now; from the power of ſin and from a ſtate of condemnation. He delivereth alſo from the <hi>wrath to come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The glory of CHRIST and of redeening Grace is at laſt this, That to believers in him <hi>there is no more curſe.</hi> They may have ſorrow and grief, pain and torment, they may be ſick and die; <hi>Earthquakes</hi> may ſwallow them, and the <hi>grave</hi> devour their bodies; but the Day is coming when <hi>there ſhall be no more curſe.</hi> Revel. 22.3. There are <hi>remains</hi> of ſin and of the curſe here in the body, but out of it not the leaſt remain of either for ever and ever.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. Is the Curſe <hi>devouring</hi> the earth for mans ſin? ſee the lamentable <hi>hardneſs</hi> of ſinners in their <hi>impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency.</hi> Altho' men ſee the earth they live on <hi>devour'd</hi> by the curſe, yet they will not repent. As <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſaw his kingdom deſtroyed by one <hi>plague</hi> and another, and yet <hi>hardned his heart.</hi> GOD highly reſents this in his own people, Amos. 4.10, 11, 12. <hi>Yet have ye not returned to me ſaith the LORD!</hi> tho' <hi>I overthrew ſome of you as</hi> I did <hi>Sodom and Gomorrah! Wherefore thus will I do unto you,</hi> and <hi>prepare to meet thy GOD O Iſrael!</hi> This is <hi>the Iniquity that is not purged,</hi> but men perſiſt in it <hi>till they die.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Men are and act as if there were <hi>no curſe,</hi> no ſin or miſery, upon earth. They <hi>ſpend their days in mirth,
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:002853_0085_0FE67880AB309848"/>and in a moment go down to the grave.</hi> This is deeply reſented by GOD, with juſt anger and from his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der compaſſions to us: Ezek. 21.9, 10, 11. <hi>Son of man, A ſword is ſharpned and furbiſhed: It ſhall be upon my people: Terrors ſhall be on them: Smite thou on thy thigh.</hi> So our LORD <hi>wept</hi> over the inſenſible <hi>City,</hi> nigh unto deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Every impenitent ſinner is <hi>under</hi> the Curſe. Hell is open before him, and <hi>the wrath of GOD abideth on him.</hi> Deſtruction upon deſtruction muſt be cried in his ears. And O that ſinners under the <hi>Goſpel</hi> would conſider how nearly the curſe concerns <hi>them,</hi> how dreadfully it threatens and hangs over them more than others! and how heavy it will ly upon them for ever if they die impenitent and unpardoned. — You that have heard and known the curſes of GOD's law, and have been warned and <hi>perſwaded by the terrors of GOD!</hi> You that have ſeen the <hi>flying roll</hi> as it is <hi>ſpread</hi> abroad in the <hi>Book of GOD;</hi> ſeen the length and the breadth of it, as it <hi>goeth over the face of the whole earth!</hi> how ſhould you fear its entring into thy <hi>houſe</hi> and thy <hi>ſoul!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Be exhorted therefore to an inſtant earneſt and deep <hi>repentance.</hi> Think <hi>who hath warned you,</hi> how GOD hath warned you, <hi>to flee from the wrath to come!</hi> Ly no longer ſecurely and profanely in a ſtate of ſin and miſery, quiet and at eaſe under the curſe of GOD. Wilt thou not <hi>fear</hi> under this <hi>Condemnation?</hi> O <hi>turn</hi> and look unto the crucified JESUS, that he would <hi>remember thee from his Kingdom!</hi> See how he <hi>bore</hi> the Curſe to <hi>ſave</hi> thee from it!</p>
                  <p>May I not ſay, <hi>This</hi> is the <hi>voice</hi> of GOD unto <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Country</hi> in the late fearful and terrible <hi>Earthquake,</hi> which but <hi>four</hi> nights ago ran thro' the <hi>Land,</hi> and threaten'd every <hi>Town,</hi> every <hi>Family</hi> and ever <hi>Perſon</hi> with a ſudden deſtruction. When the hollow trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Earth <hi>roar'd</hi> ſo in our ears, when the ground
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:002853_0086_0FE6785705A96AC8"/>
                     <hi>ſhook</hi> to a fearful degree under us, and our houſes over our heads; when the earth threaten'd in a moment to open its mouth and ſwallow us up, and our houſes threaten'd to fall upon us and cruſh us to death; when we feared that we might inſtantly go down, we and our children and houſholds, our neighbours and friends together into the pit; buried in the ruines of our fallen dwellings; the <hi>Godly</hi> like the pious Sons and Daughters of <hi>Job</hi> on whom the houſe fell, the <hi>wicked</hi> like <hi>Dathan</hi> &amp; <hi>Abiram</hi> whoſe tents and families the earth ſwallowed up at once. What the voice of GOD then was to every impenitent ſinner let his own <hi>Conſcience</hi> tell him! Conſcience, which was a <hi>ſwiſt witneſs</hi> in that amazing minute; and bro't thy ſins to remembrance, ſet thee to the <hi>bar</hi> of CHRIST, and caſt thee at the foot of mercy. What were thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant cries for ſparing and pardoning mercy in that trying moment! Speak <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and tell ſinners a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain GOD's voice to them in that aſtoniſhing Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation.</p>
                  <p>I call it not a <hi>Judgment,</hi> but a <hi>Threatning</hi> and loud <hi>Warning</hi> of deſerved judgment; a <hi>mid night cry</hi> to awaken us out of a <hi>ſleep</hi> in ſin, the ſleep of death: And then it will eventually prove a <hi>Mercy,</hi> the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt mercy, the happieſt minute, of our whole life.</p>
                  <p>GOD from the bowels of the earth preach'd a ſtartling <hi>Sermon</hi> to us; we heard and quaked; as when he ſpake from the <hi>ſhaking Mountain</hi> of old unto his people; ſo we heard his voice and <hi>were afraid.</hi> O might the impreſſions be <hi>ſaving</hi> on us, ſanctifying and laſting, and never wear off!</p>
                  <p>Our GOD has ſhown us his greatneſs and power, his holineſs and juſtice, his great goodneſs and tender mercies: <hi>Say unto GOD how terrible art thou in thy works! thro' the greatneſs of thy power ſhall thy enemies ſubmit themſelves unto thee. All the earth ſhall worſhip thee and ſhall ſing unto thee; they ſhall ſing to thy name.
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:002853_0087_0FE67887002AE478"/>Come and ſee the works of GOD: He is terrible in his doings to the children of men. He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations: Let not the rebellious exalt themſelves. O bleſs our GOD ye people, and make the voice of his praiſe to be heard: which holdeth our ſoul in life, and ſuffereth not our feet to be moved.</hi> Pſalm. 66.4, —9.</p>
                  <p>What a <hi>ſingular</hi> thing is it and very extraordinary, that there is ſcarce a perſon now thro' the whole land, but has heard the terrible voice of GOD in a dreadful earthquake? that as was ſaid to <hi>Iſrael, Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice,</hi> ſo I may ſay to you, From the bowels of the earth he has made us to hear it, <hi>and that a mighty voice!</hi> the earth cried out to us of our ſins, as a heavy burthen, <hi>too heavy</hi> to be born; it groan'd and <hi>travailed in pain,</hi> as wanting to be delivered.</p>
                  <p>The call of GOD in ſuch a Providence is general and <hi>univerſal,</hi> to every perſon, (man, woman and child) and every family, in every part of the land. The blow was immediately at every ones <hi>life,</hi> at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſinners heart, and at the life of his <hi>ſoul;</hi> This night, this inſtant ſhall it be requir'd.—At the life of all <hi>thine</hi> with thee was the ſword pointed, thoſe that are deareſt to thee and <hi>as thy own ſoul:</hi> As at the periſhing of the <hi>rebels in Iſrael,</hi> their <hi>wives</hi> and <hi>little ones</hi> went down together, <hi>and all Iſrael fled at their cry.</hi> In what <hi>confuſion</hi> did they die? without time for one regular cry to GOD for mercy.</p>
                  <p>Nothing is like <hi>terrible,</hi> take the Judgment in all its parts together, as to be ſwallow'd up alive by an <hi>earthquake.</hi> Indeed death in ſome other form may be as <hi>ſudden,</hi> and ſo as <hi>awful</hi> to him that dies; but this is to many, to hundreds, to thouſands together, as GOD orders it.—The cry of <hi>fire</hi> is frightful to us; but what is a Nei'bour's houſe on ſire, or our own,
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:002853_0088_0FE6785881D4B448"/>to our houſes falling on us, or ſinking with us, in an inſtant? In <hi>ſtorms</hi> and <hi>inundations</hi> the winds and waters uſually riſe gradually, but an <hi>Earthquake</hi> gives no notice of its approach; nor is there any means of eſcaping as in moſt other judgments, nor time to call upon GOD.</p>
                  <p>And yet let me tell you, There's a <hi>day</hi> coming upon every one of us, more dreadful than an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake to impenitent ſinners; I mean the day of <hi>Death</hi> and the day of <hi>Judgment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Are not the <hi>convulſions</hi> of death within the body of a ſinner equal to the quaking of univerſal nature round about him? when the <hi>the earthly bouſe of this Tabernacle is diſſolving,</hi> and his ſoul rending from his body! when the grave opens to ſwallow up his body, and hell is open before him to devour his ſoul! Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you could ſee an <hi>earthquake</hi> coming on at a day or two diſtance of time, but you knew that you and your houſhold muſt then be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd up: <hi>Death</hi> is all this to perſons, families, towns and provinces. <hi>It daſhes the fathers and the ſons together, nor pities, nor ſpares, nor hath mercy:</hi> As the Prophet ſpeaks Jer. 13.14, 15, 16. <hi>Wherefore hear ye and give ear; be not proud, for the LORD hath ſpoken; Give glory to the LORD your GOD before be cauſe darkneſs, and your feet ſtumble on the dark mountains; and while ye look for light he turn it into the ſhadow of death, and make it groſs darkneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the day of <hi>Judgment</hi> is the day of terror; when the <hi>graves</hi> ſhall open at the voice of CHRIST, and the <hi>ſeas</hi> too, and throw up their dead, <hi>ſpue</hi> out the vile bodies of the wicked; which would be glad then if the earth would kindly open again, and cover them for ever from the face and wrath of the <hi>Lamb.</hi> Then the moſt <hi>fearleſs</hi> and audacious ſinners that are or have been on earth, <hi>the Captains and the mighty men,</hi> with all their ungodly train of dependents, <hi>every bond man</hi>
                     <pb n="83" facs="unknown:002853_0089_0FE6788721C10978"/>of the ſame character for impiety and impenitence, <hi>ſhall fly to the rocks and mountains and call on them to fall on 'em and bide them.</hi> Rev. 6.15.</p>
                  <p>Was the ſudden noiſe of the Earthquake terrible t'other night? much more will the <hi>day of the LORD</hi> be ſo which <hi>comes as a thief in the night, wherein the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens ſhall paſs away with a great noiſe.</hi> 2 Pet. 3 10. What will the noiſe of a <hi>diſſolving world</hi> be?—O realize it, <hi>ſinner!</hi> there is ſomething infinitely worſe before thee than the worſt of earthquakes except thou repent.</p>
                  <p>But I ſaid that I did not call it a <hi>Judgment,</hi> but a <hi>warning</hi> and threatning of judgment, and a <hi>call</hi> to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi> It had been a terrible judgment if GOD had ſuffer'd it to go further, as he eaſily could, and was eno' provoked by our ſins. And the wonder was that it went no further. If our houſes had fallen and buried us; if many had ſunk together into the earth or been cruſhed to death, as in our time it was at <hi>Jamaica,</hi> and lately at <hi>Palermo</hi> a great City in <hi>Italy;</hi> how dreadful had the judgment been?</p>
                  <p>But O the <hi>mercy!</hi> the wonder of mercy! that after ſuch a ſhock we do not hear of one houſe fallen, nor of a ſingle life loſt, nor of a broken bone! GOD has only ſhook his rod terribly over us, and we muſt ſay —<hi>to us Goodneſs!</hi> while we think of the <hi>ſeverity</hi> to others, who were <hi>not greater ſinners</hi> than we, when we compare our light and means for repentance with theirs.</p>
                  <p>And I truſt GOD means this Providence in <hi>mercy</hi> to many, and of great <hi>glory</hi> to Himſelf in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion and ſalvation. So it may be among the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>favours</hi> of Providence that the land ever ſaw. And if it be not thus, it will be a dreadful <hi>ſpiritual</hi> judgment, as the <hi>rod</hi> of <hi>Moſes</hi> was to <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="84" facs="unknown:002853_0090_0FE67858A84D0C10"/>
The <hi>preſent Impreſſions</hi> on the minds and hearts of all ſorts of Perſons by this ſhake, on young and old, godly and wicked, is a token for good. What prayers, with praiſes and thankſgivings, have been going up to heaven from perſons, from families, and from crowded Aſſemblies and Congregations; with eager eyes and hearts, and from many a fervent and gracious one! It looks as if GOD had ordained to himſelf <hi>praiſe and ſtrength from the mouths of babes and ſucklings</hi> for the preſent: But O how ſoon may the fearful minute be forgotten, and this ſudden impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wear off? It will certainly do ſo if GOD do not graciouſly faſten it by the power of his SPIRIT on our hearts; which we muſt earneſtly beg of him with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſant ſupplications, and be often looking back on that <hi>night of trembling,</hi> and call to mind what our apprehenſions, pravers and tho'ts then were; and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten put our houſholds on thinking over their ſober tho'ts and fervent holy deſires and purpoſes (by the grace of GOD) at that time.</p>
                  <p>Indeed ſuch <hi>extraordinary</hi> things are not the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry means of <hi>converſion</hi> to ſinners. They may be ſo, and they ought to be ſo; but the impreſſions of ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den frights and ſurprizing terrors are apt as ſuddenly and ſtrangely to wear off. If men hear not <hi>Moſes and the Prophets,</hi> the preached <hi>Goſpel,</hi> neither will they be perſuaded tho' one ſhould come to them <hi>from the dead.</hi> The congregation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> lay quaking before the burning and ſhaking <hi>Mountain,</hi> but how few of them were ſuitably or ſavingly affected with what they ſaw and heard? Yea tho' they had a <hi>Moſes</hi> with them, to teach and warn and entreat them.</p>
                  <p>Again, One day the ſinners in <hi>Iſrael</hi> fled at the cry of ſinking <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> but the very next day they fell a murmuring again, and called <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> the murderers of the LORD's people.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="85" facs="unknown:002853_0091_0FE6788994DF1808"/>
Yet in the hand of the SPIRIT, and by his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> this Providence may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an effectual means for convincing and convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſinners, and for the building up of ſaints in faith and holineſs to eternal life. GOD of his infinite mercy grant it may be ſo.</p>
                  <p>He has uſed one more <hi>Means</hi> with us, if we will be wro't upon by things <hi>extraordinary;</hi> and the Year has been filled with many <hi>ſuch</hi> means, even <hi>thunder and tempeſt and the flame of devouring fire.</hi> O that there were ſuch an heart in us! this was GOD's own wiſh reſpecting his trembling and promiſing people before the burning mountain; but it ſtrongly intimated to them how deceitful their hearts were, and how little would come of their ſudden promiſes and hopes of a perpetual future obedience.</p>
                  <p>If great terror and great goodneſs together will affect us and work on us, we ſhall be wro't upon. But theſe united will effect nothing without GOD's powerful hand.</p>
                  <p>Did ever any people ſee or hear or feel ſuch a ſhock of the earth, from one end of the Land to the other, and yet no hurt done to man or beaſt? They that have been in earthquakes in other places, in <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica</hi> and in <hi>Italy</hi> tell us, that they never felt, heard and ſaw the like. <hi>It is the LORD's doing and marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in our eyes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Who of us is there that can now wiſh GOD had not done this! It was terrible for the time, may it be joyous in the fruits and remembrance of it. Every one is ready to ſay, <hi>LORD that I may never forget it!</hi> Ask <hi>this</hi> of GOD humbly, and beg of him an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of ſaving good from it.</p>
                  <p>If it have not a <hi>ſanctifying</hi> effect on us, (as was hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before) it will have a <hi>bad</hi> one, which GOD for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid! If it be not for the <hi>better</hi> to us, it will be for the <hi>worſe;</hi> like the <hi>other</hi> means that GOD uſes with men
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:002853_0092_0FE6786021FCED80"/>for their ſpiritual good. If we do not improve <hi>this</hi> call and warning of GOD <hi>from below</hi> to us, after the <hi>many</hi> we have had from <hi>above;</hi> it will aggravate our guilt now and our condemnation hereafter. We muſt anſwer for <hi>this</hi> alſo in the day of Judgment, That after the publick Inſtructions of the laſt <hi>Lord's day,</hi> GOD came at <hi>night</hi> to every family and to every perſon, and ſpake to them from the <hi>Deep</hi> that lieth under; and if yet we <hi>repent not to give him glory</hi> and to ſave our ſelves from wrath and ruine, we ſhall <hi>receive the greater damnation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I now cloſe my <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> as it hath pleaſed the HOLY GHOST to do the <hi>Scriptures</hi> of the <hi>Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Words</hi> worthy of our moſt ſerious attention and conſideration: Words full of <hi>terror</hi> to the wicked and impenitent, and as full of <hi>comfort</hi> to the penitent and obedient: Words full of proper <hi>warning</hi> and <hi>inſtruction</hi> unto both: Mal.
