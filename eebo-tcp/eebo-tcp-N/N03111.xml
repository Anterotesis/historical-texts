            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But it is obſervable, that the Revelation which God was pleas'd to make of his Mind, was gradual and various. He diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd his Will unto the Fathers at ſundry times, before the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge by <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Noah:</hi> After the Flood by <hi>Abraham, Jacob, Moſes</hi> and all the Prophets; and in divers manners; ſometimes by immediate Inſpiration; ſometimes by a lively Voice; ſometimes by Signs and Wonders from Heaven, ſometimes by Dreams which are the Images or Reſemblances of things preſented to the Fancy in Sleep; and frequently by Viſions, which (as they ſtand in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra-diſtinction to Dreams) are the Repreſentations of things made to the open and waking Eye; for this Reaſon it is tho't the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets in old time us'd to be ſtiled SEERS. In this laſt ſenſe Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God revealed much of his Will to the Jewiſh Nation and People by the Prophet <hi>Zechariah:</hi> He was a Man authoriz'd, and commiſſionated by Heaven, to call them to Repentance, and agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Power he was veſted with, and the true notation of his Name which is one mindful of the Lord, he was very obſervant of what he had received of the Lord to be delivered unto them.</p>

Hence, we find him in the beginning of this Book exhorting the Jews to return to God, aſſuring them (in his Name and Fear) that If they did ſo the Lord of Hoſts would return to them, but (it ſeems) they were obſtinate in their evil Courſes, and refuſed to return.

Here's not only a Declaration of their Inſincerity and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy in their Faſting, but a moſt ſevere Reprimand given them by God himſelf for their profeſſing to engage in a Buſineſs which they were not hearty in, that is to ſay, for faſting but not unto God. The Queſtion <hi>(Did ye at all faſt? —)</hi> carries as much in it, and by the Repetition <hi>(unto me, even to me)</hi> is plainly ſeen what a vaſt Streſs God laid upon it; and therefore for their Non-obſervance of their Duty they juſtly merited a Reproof from him.</p>

            <p>People's Religion is not uniform and regular.

They don't repent and turn to God in the Way which he has preſcrib'd: They don't repent in a Way of Humility, Faith, and Prayer.

Agreably we find God inſiſting much
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:003756_0011_100256A308646060"/>on this in the ſacred Oracles. Deut. 26.16. <hi>This Day the Lord thy God hath commanded thee to do theſe Statutes, and Judgments: thou ſhalt therefore keep and do them.</hi> How? It follows, <hi>with all thine Heart and with all thy Soul.</hi> Parallel to this is that Text, Prov. 23.26. <hi>My Son give me thine Heart,</hi> — and the true Reaſon we have aſſigned in 1 Sam. 16.7. — <hi>For the Lord ſeeth not as Man ſeeth; for Man looketh on the outward Appearance, but the Lord looketh on the Heart.</hi> For the Lord ſearcheth all Hearts, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth all the Imaginations of the Thoughts: If we therefore ſeek him with our Heart, he will be found of us, but if that be wanting he will caſt us off for ever. This is the Life and Soul in every Duty.</p>
            <p>Some People there are, that will ſeem to confeſs their Sins to Almighty God very freely, (it may be with Tears in their Eyes) They will bitterly lament their Pride, Covetouſneſs, their Uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritableneſs, their Malice, Envy, &amp;c. and if a Judgment were to be pronounc'd according to preſent outward Appearance, one would think them to be honeſt and ſincere in theſe Things; but alas! how ſoon do we ſee their Practiſes run counter to all their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Faſting and Humiliation?

            <p>Repentance (whatever ſome may think of it) is not a ſlight Action; the Work of a Day that is preſently over; but it is a very great Work, the Buſineſs of a Perſon's whole Life: The Reaſon is moſt plain and obvious to every one's Underſtanding; becauſe we are contracting new Guilt and Defilement every Day that we live; and therefore there is need of daily Repentance; nevertheleſs it is to be feared that ſome People are ready to ſatisfy themſelves with a general Repentance; They are for diſpatching the Work at once; their Goodneſs is of very ſhort Duration and Continuance. Thus we read concerning <hi>Ephraim</hi> of old, Hoſea 6.4. <hi>O Ephraim, what ſhall I do unto thee? O Judah what ſhall I do unto thee? for your Goodneſs is as a morning Cloud, and as the early Dew it goeth away.</hi> It vaniſhes almoſt as ſoon as it appears.</p>
            <p>To day poſſibly they will be extremely religious, ſober, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout, to morrow we ſhall ſee them purſuing their former evil Ways: To day perhaps they will not be perſwaded to eat any thing or drink any thing ſave juſt to ſupply the Neceſſities of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; anon we ſhall find them drowned in ſenſual Exceſſes: To day grave, and mortify'd in their Aſpect, and Deportment to a very great Degree; to morrow juſt the Reverſe; full of Levity and Vanity.

To ſpeak in plain Language; Such People as theſe do only faſt for a while; that they may return to their Sins with greater Looſeneſs and Extravagance; juſt like a Courſe of Water that has been ſtop'd for ſome time, it becomes more rapid and violent when the Dam is taken away; ſo theſe return with greater Greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs after the Reſtraint which was laid on them is off. <hi>But thus it is happened to them according to the true Proverb; as a Dog returneth to his Vomit, ſo a Fool returneth to his Folly,</hi> (or as the Margin has it, <hi>Iterateth,</hi> i. e. repeateth his Fooliſhneſs) Which the Apoſtle cites from the wiſe Man, with ſome Addition and Enlargement; 2 Pet. 2.22. — <hi>The Dog is turned to his own Vomit again; and the Sow that was waſhed to her wallowing in the Mire.</hi> What was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the Jewiſh People, may with great Pertinency be applied to them; Iſai. 58.4. <hi>Behold, ye faſt for Strife and Debate, and to ſmite with the Fiſt of Wickedneſs; Ye ſhall not faſt as ye do this Day,</hi> (or as it might perhaps be better rendred, <hi>Ye faſt not, at this Day: Ye faſt not at all</hi>) <hi>to make your Voice to be beard on high.</hi>

            <p>Enq. <hi>When may a People be ſaid to faſt in a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and ſolemn Manner?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>When there is a very deep Humiliation and Contrition of Soul for Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed there may be ſome ſort of Shame and Humiliation, even in carnal and unſanctify'd People, wro't by the common Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the divine Spirit, whereby they are made ſorry, not after a godly but a worldly ſort, for they only fear the doleful Effects of God's Vengeance. They are not humbled for Sin as it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the great GOD; a Violation of his holy Law, and as it is exceeding ſinful in it's very Nature, but only as it is deſtructive of their Happineſs. Now this Sorrow is entirely legal, and in the Language of Divinity, it is called ATTRITION: Thus <hi>Ahab, Judas,</hi> &amp;c. have been humbled; but where Humiliation is evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical; ſincere and acceptable to God, it will be inward, real and very powerful, it will proceed from a ſtrong and ſenſible Convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the evil Nature and Demerit of all Sin; and of their baſe Ingratitude towards God, as well as a moſt bloody Cruelty to their
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:003756_0014_100256A6E227D9C8"/>own precious Souls. Hence when they come to make Reflections on themſelves for their Sins, they will be deeply ſorrowful there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for; They will not only expreſs their Concern in a few external <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p>Thus they will weep ſorely; weep with all bitterneſs of Heart; mourn like a Dove; and chatter as a Swallow as did <hi>Hezekiah.</hi> Their Sorrow will be a moſt pungent, afflictive Sorrow; ſuch a Sorrow as hares the Sin ſo much, that they now prefer Death to the Embraces of Luſt. Behold, and ſee if there be any Sorrow like unto their Sorrow! —</p>
            <p>Now ſuch People as are thus ſorrowfully affected, and moved with a Senſe of Sin, may be ſaid to faſt in a ſacred Manner. They certainly preſent Sacrifices well pleaſing to Heaven. Pſalm 51.16, 17. <hi>For thou deſireſt not Sacrifice, elſe would I give it: thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteſt not in Burnt-Offering. The Sacrifices of God are a broken Spirit: a broken and a contrite Heart, O God, thou wilt not deſpiſe.</hi> For thus ſaith the high and lofty one, that inhabiteth Eternity, whoſe Name is holy, I dwell in the high and holy Place; with him alſo that is of an humble and contrite Spirit, to revive the Spirit of the humble and the Heart of the contrite ones. To this Man will I look, even to him that is poor, and of a contrite Spirit, and that trembleth at my Word.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>When there is an earneſt ſeeking Reconciliation with an offended Majeſty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if we are duly humbled for Sin, this will neceſſarily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue; we can't help imploring a ſpeedy Reconciliation with God whom we have offended. Now in order to this, we muſt review our Conduct; carefully examine into our paſt Life and Actions; ſearch and try our Ways; ingenuouſly, and freely acknowledge our Offences; manifeſt our Hatred of them; judge and condemn our ſelves before God on the Account of them. We muſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe renew our Friendſhip with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt by a true Faith, grounding our entire Hopes of obtaining divine Mercy in the Merits of his moſt precious Blood and Sacrifice; and to all this we muſt oblige our ſelves by the moſt ſtrict Obligations to
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:003756_0015_100256AA70AFCE60"/>depart from Iniquity; to deny ungodlineſs and every worldly Luſt, and to live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly; adorning the Doctrine of God our Saviour in all Things for the future. <hi>Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is meet to be ſaid unto God,</hi> as in Job 34 31. — <hi>I will not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend any more; If I have done Iniquity, I will do no more.</hi> What have I to do any more with Idols?</p>
            <p>Now ſuch People as earneſtly ſeek a thorough Reconciliation with God in this Way may be ſaid to fiſt in a religious and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Manner. Indeed it is true, we ought every day to ſeek Reconciliation, with God thro' his dear Son (for who can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his Errors?) but it is requiſite in a ſpecial Manner when we keep a Day to Faſt, and pray to the Lord; then to make Reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our Friendſhip and Peace which we have violated in a great Variety of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nſtances. This is very agreable to God, proper and ſuitable to the Occaſion of the Day, and an Evidence of our Heartineſs in what we are engaged in.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>When there is a ſolemn Renewal of Covenant with God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We find this practiſed in ancient times, 2 Kings 23.2, 3. <hi>And the King went up into the Houſe of the Lord, and all the Men of Judah, and all the Inhabitants of Jeruſalem with him, and the Prieſts, and the Prophets, and all the People, both ſmall and great: and he read in their Ears all the Words of the Book of the Covenant which was found in the Houſe of the Lord. And the King ſtood by a Pillar and made a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant before the Lord to walk after the Lord, and to keep his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and his Teſtimonies, and his Statutes, with all their Heart, and with all their Soul, to perform the Words of this Covenant that were written in this Book: And all the People</hi> STOOD TO THE COVENANT. They ſaid Amen to it; and conſented to the Conditions of it. And ſo we read, 2 Chron. 34.30, 31, 32. <hi>And the King went up into the Houſe of the Lord and all the Men of Judah, and the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of Jeruſalem, and the Prieſts, and the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>vites, &amp; the People great and ſmall: And he read in their Ears all the Words of the Book of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, that was found in the Houſe of the Lord And the King ſtood in his Place, and made a Covenant before the Lord, to walk after the Lord, and to keep his Commandments, and his Teſtimonies, and his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, with all their Heart, and with all their Soul, to perform the Words the Covenant which were written in this Book. And he cauſed all that were preſent in Benjamin and Jeruſalem, to ſtand to it, and the inhabitants of Jeruſalem,</hi> DID ACCORDING TO THE COVENANT OF GOD, <hi>the God of their Fathers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus it was the good old Way to renew Covenant with God; and this was regiſtred undoubtedly for our Imitation. We muſt remember that the Word is gone out of our Mouth: We have ſworn to be true and faithful to the King of Heaven; and we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:003756_0016_100256ACE3924708"/>go back unleſs we draw back unto Perdition. When we vow a Vow unto God we muſt not defer to pay it, for he has no Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in Fools, therefore we ought to pay that which we have vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Better is it that we ſhould not vow, than that we ſhould vow and not pay. Now in order to a due and regular Diſcharge of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> Part of our Duty, we muſt be unfeignedly ſorry, and grieved for our Perfidiouſneſs and Baſeneſs: Pricked at the Heart becauſe we have ſo frequently, and ſhamefully broken Covenant with God. We muſt bind our ſelves more ſtrictly to fulfil the vaſt Bonds and Engagements which we have laid our ſelves under. We muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſervedly, and chearfully acquieſce in the Diſpoſe of our ſelves; and ſubmit to the Terms of the Covenant which we have entred into with God and one another. And how weighty and ſolemn a Tranſaction is this?—It ſeems therefore this is one Way to ſanctify a Faſt and obſerve it in an holy Manner.</p>
            <p>Agreably (as I am inform'd) ſome Churches in the Country make it a Practice to have the Church Covenant read and renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Publick on Faſt-Days, that ſo People may ſee their manifold Defects; be humbled for them; and led to reform what has been amiſs in any of their Conduct and Converſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Certainly we have ſufficient Precedent for it; and it might (by the Bleſſing of God) be one happy Expedient for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting a glorious REFORMATION. — A Thing long wiſh'd and pray'd for! — Thus I believed, therefore have I ſpoken.</p>

In like Manner, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the Place where God fixed his Temple, which was the Joy of the whole Earth, is laid deſolate. And this we know, that Fools becauſe of their Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions and becauſe of their Iniquities are afflicted. Perhaps indeed God ſometimes reſerves almoſt all their Puniſhment to a future State, but tho' there may be ſome Exceptions as to indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals or particular Perſons, yet it is very commonly otherwiſe, and eſpecially if we conſider Perſons as combined and formned into So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties; and poſſibly this may be the unhappy Caſe of a whole Body of People (at leaſt the Generality of them) that they don't faſt in a religious and ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now, whenever it is thus they may expect that theſe terrible Judgments that have been inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on others will come upon them likewiſe, the preſent State being the only State to puniſh them in, as they are a People. Shall not God viſit ſuch a People as are equally guilty with a like Puniſhment even in this Life? Shall not his Soul be avenged on ſuch a Nation?</p>

               <p n="3">III. <hi>What we have heard ſhould put us upon the moſt impartial Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of our ſelves this Day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Self-Examination is a Duty always incumbent on us, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally on Faſt-Days. This is a Seaſon wherein it is moſt beautiful. Let us all therefore retire within our own Boſoms, and ſoberly ask our ſelves, <q>What have we been doing theſe many Years that God has ſpared us in the World? We have had a ſpace for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and many ſolemn Warnings againſt our evil Courſes, and loud Calls to a thorough Repentance and Amendment of our Lives, but may it not be ſaid concerning us, I gave them a ſpace to repent, and they repented not: They are not humbled even unto this Day! We have 'tis true faſted many a time, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to humble our Souls before God but to what good Effect? Can we ſay that we are more circumſpect and unblameable in our Conduct as to God and Man? Do we reap any ſpiritual and ſaving Benefit by all our Faſting and Prayers? Can we find that our Souls grow the more healthy and proſperous? In all this time have we faſted unto God, even unto God?</q> Certainly ſuch Queries as theſe put to our Conſciences and a comfortable Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of them are of the greateſt Importance in the whole World.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. <hi>What we have heard ſhould therefore prevail with us to faſt in a ſared and religious Manner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Words of the inſpired Apoſtle deſerves a ſpecial Remark on this Occaſion, Rom. 14 6. <hi>He that regardeth the Day, regardeth it to the Lord; and be that regardeth not the Day to the Lord, he doth not regard it.</hi> — If we don't anſwer the Deſign of our Faſting to what Purpoſe is it to faſt? Verily, It is a meer piece of Mockery, hardens us in our vicious Courtes; gives Satan (our avowed Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary) a mighty Advantage againſt us, and is diſtaſtful both to God and Man.</p>
               <p>What Arguments ſhall I uſe to urge and perſwade us to a due Sanctification of a Faſt? Two only I ſhall mention at this time.—</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>God is exceeding deſirous of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He waits upon us that he may ſee us a humble, holy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed People; a peculiar People zealous of all good Works. His Bounty (in the various Expreſſions of it) is deſigned to lead us to unfeig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="17" facs="unknown:003756_0021_100256B845214738"/>to abandon us to our own fooliſh Choice, i. e. to final Deſtruction. How pathetic that Language? Jer. 13.27.—<hi>Wilt thou not be made clean?

               <p>And now ſhan't we all ſtrive to gratify God, who is continually doing Good to us, eſpecially when we do hereby ſo very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult our own greateſt Intereſt, and Felicity.
