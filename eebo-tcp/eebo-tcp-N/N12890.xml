            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>In the firſt chapter of the book of GENESIS, 20th and 27th verſes, it is written,
<q>And God ſaid, let us make man in our image, after our likeneſs: and let them have dominion over the fiſh of the ſea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.— So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him: male and female created he them.—</q>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Jewiſh Hiſtorian, furniſhed with mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials from on high, hath given us this conciſe account of the origin of man:— He tells us, That God created him, male and female, in his own image, and after his likeneſs.</p>
            <p>In conformity to the inſtructions thus received, and partly in conſequence of it, the wiſe and virtuous, in all ages and places, aſcribing their exiſtence to the ſame cauſe, have believed, that the Spirit of God hath made them, and the breath of the Almighty hath given them life.</p>

Many and various have been the opinions of Divines, both ancient and modern, in regard to what, and how much is intended by, and included in the Image of God, wherein man is ſaid to be created. Every ſimilitude of God, and every degree thereof, in the creature, man or angle, is doubtleſs ſo far his Image; and ſo it appears to be explained, in his Image, after his likeneſs. Had the Image of God in man been no where mentioned in the book of Revelation, but in this part of ſacred hiſtory, it is more than probable, there would not have been ſuch a diverſity of ſentiment about it; but that it would have been confined (not indeed excluſively of the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual faculties of the human mind, and the original rectitude of them, for there is ſimilitude in theſe; but) chiefly to that communicated right of ſovereignty, which man received at his creation: That as God was ſupreme Lord and Governor over all; ſo he ſhould be over the creatures of this lower world, and have domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion on earth. This reſtricted ſenſe appears to offer the moſt obviouſly of any from the hiſtory itſelf:—But as men advance in the powers of reaſon, in their moral qualities, or in any kind of reſemblance towards the Deity, the idea of his Image in them, is neceſſarily varied, and enlarged:— Hence it has been differently ſpoken of in other parts of revelation; eſpecially by the New Teſtament writers, who have ſometimes repreſented it as conſiſting in holineſs, And from this various uſe and ſignification of the Image of God in man, many learned and good men have ſuppoſed, it ought to be underſtood from the firſt as a complex idea, made up of ſeveral ingredients. So much I have thought not improper to ſay in regard to the Image of God, in which man was created; and, indeed, I could not well avoid it, as it makes part of the hiſtory, placed at the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:016303_0005_0F9C1F664BC53EA0"/>head of this diſcourſe. Senſible, however, of my inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to offer any thing on the point, that has not already been much better done by others; and the deſign of this Lecture demanding no ſuch inveſtigation, I ſhould, perhaps, have been acquitted if I had paſſed it in ſilence.</p>
            <p>Other diſquiſitions are now to be made, which, it is hoped, will have ſome tendency, "to prove, explain or ſhew the proper uſe and improvement of the principles of Natural Religion," which is our preſent ſubject.</p>
            <p>For this purpoſe, and the more juſt arrangement of our thoughts, the creature man, and the religion of his nature, ſhall be the ſubject of our promiſcuous inquiry: This will prepare the way for ſome obſervations and reflections, which will cloſe the preſent diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>The faculty of reaſon, with which man is endowed, enable him, by obvious deductions from the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of the beauty, order and majeſty of the world, and the evident impreſſions of power, wiſdom and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which it every where bears, both to argue the being of a God, and to admit alſo, that there is one, when told, that it muſt be ſo; and of conſequence, to make conſiderable diſcoveries in religion.</p>
            <p>Religion, both natural and revealed, in the juſt and proper notion of it, has an immediate reſpect to the Deity; and in this view, though not in any other, it may be diſtinguiſhed from juſt ſentiment, and right action, which have no regard to his authority. It is founded in the divine exiſtence and perfections; that is, if God did not exiſt, or if he were not poſſeſſed of thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, which are neceſſarily eſſential to a ſelf-exiſtent Being, there could be no religion. The perception of
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:016303_0006_0F9C1F678A439FE0"/>the obligation of religion on man ariſes from his believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that God is, from the knowledge he has of his intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual capacities, the circumſtances he is placed in, and the relations he bears to the Creator. The obligation of religion, and the perception of this obligation in the human mind are diſtinct and different ideas; and the former muſt be ſuppoſed to exiſt prior, in the order of nature, to the latter.— What I intend is, that religion is naturally and in itſelf right: It is fit and proper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in the creature to worſhip and obey the Creator, and it cannot be otherwiſe, ſo long as the relations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them remain: But then the obligation to do ſo is only felt, when, and ſo far as this is perceived to be fit and proper. It is very poſſible for man, ſo far to abuſe his intellectual faculties, neglect enquiry and every rational deduction, as not to feel the force of this obligation, or at leaſt to have but dark, indetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and confuſed notions about it. This is more or leſs the caſe with all ſuch as have fallen into any kinds of idolatrous worſhip. The perception of the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of religion, in inſtances, where the proper object of worſhip is miſtaken, cannot be ſuppoſed equally clear and vigorous, as in thoſe, where it is not; for ſuperſtition, about which there is often the greateſt zeal, is no other than the corruption of pure religion. Men fall into the former, in the ſame proportion as they loſe the proper ſenſe of the obligation of the latter. It would, I truſt, be far from the truth to affirm, that the obligation to worſhip the One only living and true God ceaſes, in proportion as the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of it in the mind does ſo, or becomes leſs clear and manifeſt: Yet ſo it muſt be, if the obligation of religion be not prior to, diſtinct from, and independent on the perception of it. From the denial of this poſition,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:016303_0007_0F9C1F685E6BB458"/>it will, I think, follow, that if any individual among men ſhould ever unhappily ſink even below idolatry itſelf, and ſo darken his notions of the author of nature, as to pay him no kind of religious homage at all (which is no impoſſible ſuppoſition) the obligation thereto would become totally extinct. This obligation, therefore, to religion is to be conſidered as ſomething permanent and fixed in the nature and relations of things; founded in the divine Being and attributes, reſulting from the rectitude of his will, and ſuited to the rational faculties of men: Suited I ſay, to their rational faculties; becauſe, though it be an immoveable unabating principle of religious ſervice to every one; yet is it not, I ſuppoſe, exactly the ſame in all; that is, it does not demand preciſely the ſame ſervices towards God from all. It would, indeed, do ſo, were the rational faculties of men, their opportunities, means of moral ſcience and improvement, every where equal: But as they are manifeſtly various, and even widely different, this obligation is to each, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               </gap>— What has been often ſaid of one of them, in particular, his moſt extenſive knowledge of natural things animate and inanimate, their natures, qualities, uſes and ends; and his comprehenſive and clear diſcernment of moral truths, is, I believe, meer hypotheſis, altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupported by any thing recorded in ſacred hiſtory, of what he ever ſaid or did.

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical argument, to imagine, that, at the inſtant of his creation, he was inveſted with as ample powers of reaſon and moral reflection, as he was made capable
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:016303_0008_0F9C1F68E2D7A998"/>of attaining to, and did, probably, afterwards poſſeſs, The faculties of this myſterious man for improvement in natural and moral ſcience, were, doubtleſs, every way ſufficient for his neceſſities; for his duly obſerving the law he was under, and to quality him for that higher and more perfect happineſs for which his benevolent Creator deſigned him. This, however, determines nothing, as to the comparative ſtrength of his faculties; or whether they were greater, or leſs, than thoſe of the generality of his poſterity. The knowledge he had, the moment of his being brought into exiſtence (if, indeed, he had any, beſides the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception that he did exiſt) muſt have been communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated. But to affirm, that the communication was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eval with his exiſtence, or that his knowledge was concreated with him, is to ſay much more than is neceſſary. It is not only incapable of any proof, but is, moreover, unſupported by the argument of analogy. We are, indeed, it muſt be acknowledged, very incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent judges of what Omnipotence can do. It far ſurpaſſes the comprehenſion of creatures, boldly to aſſert, that God has not done, or cannot do, thus or ſo; meerly, becauſe we have no conception of the modus of his operations. It is as daringly impious, as it is weak and inconcluſive arguing, and it directly militates againſt the plaineſt fact in nature, the work of creation itſelf; for we do not know how things were made.— We are, notwithſtanding, to judge of things, when we have a right to judge at all, with the faculties which he has beſtowed, in the beſt manner we are able, and according to that rule which the known methods of the divine conduct furniſh us with. This rule, the beſt we have, leads us to ſuppoſe, that the knowledge of the firſt man was communicated and acquired after he had received his exiſtence; and that it was not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eval,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:016303_0009_0F9C1F6C02E99EE8"/>or concreated with him. The ſame great and important ends would be equally obtained on the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer as on the latter ſuppoſition. No doctrine of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that I know of, natural or revealed, would, in any degree, be affected, much leſs injured by it: It is indiſputably more conſonant to the ſubſequent ways of divine providence. We can have no conception of knowledge in man, or indeed in any other creature, but that, which is made up of ideas gradually ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and properly ordered by the underſtanding. We have, however, ſome colour of reaſon to ſuppoſe, that the firſt man's capacity to receive thoſe ideas, out of which he was to form his knowledge, was not as in after ages, by the ſlow degrees of infancy and youth; but in more ſpeedy and free ſucceſſion, both by frequent divine ſuggeſtions, and the continual pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of external objects: This being more adapted to the original manhood of his conſtitution, and the full-made ſtrength of his bodily ſenſes. It is moſt probable, that he was greatly aided by the Creator, in amaſſing and perfecting the furniture of his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; that he was told who his maker was, as ſoon as he could make proper uſe of ſuch knowledge; and that the great variety of living creatures, and thing inanimate, which he ſaw around him, had the ſame cauſe of exiſtence with himſelf, and were the care of the ſame providence. Hence, by deduction, he would ſoon come to have ſome knowledge of the law of his nature, his dependence on and duty to the Creator; and on every reflection would arrive to more perfect notions hereof. Had he not been favoured with the aids of intimation by his Maker, but left to his own inveſtigations, and improvements on ideas admitted by the ſenſes from outward objects only, however large we may ſuppoſe his capacity to receive
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:016303_0010_0F9C1F6D523554C8"/>and make uſe of them; and however diſpoſed we may be to allow that he would, at length, by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, of reaſon, have learnt to conſider himſelf as the effect of ſome cauſe; yet, I believe, it may be juſtly queſtioned, whether it would not have been much l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> of a Being ſo ſpiritual and incomprehenſible, as God. — What conception could he poſſibly have had at firſt, uninſtructed, as we now ſuppoſe him, of the divine unity, infinity and eternity, which are ſo eſſential to the proper notion of the Deity? The knowledge of theſe was not to be obtained, but in a courſe of juſt reaſoning and deduction; and as imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as his notions were, ſo proportionably imperfect muſt his religion have been. There appears ſufficient foundation from the hiſtory of the early periods of man's life to ſuppoſe, that he received very great and ſeaſonable helps from the Creator. It is manifeſt, that he was favoured with viſits from his Lord; and ſome circumſtances make it probable, that they were frequent. It is, moreover, certain, that he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by him, in regard to his worldly conduct and temporal felicity. Judging from the notions we now have of the divine character, which from eternity is unchangeably the ſame, we cannot, we muſt not ſuppoſe, that leſs care was taken of him, with reſpect to moral ſentiment and religious worſhip. Although the diſpenſation, man was at firſt put under, was that of ſtrict and rigorous law, "obey and live;" "tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs and die;" a diſpenſation, which admitted of no promiſe of aid under any exigency, no proviſion of pardon for any crime, for theſe would have changed
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:016303_0011_0F9C1F6DD28EB3B0"/>it's nature; yet, it is no way inconſiſtent with this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, but, on the contrary, plainly deducible from the perfections of the Deity, that man ſhould be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with every neceſſary inſtruction with regard to the law itſelf; that he might have a full underſtanding of it, he able to keep it, and appriſed of the conſequences of obeying or tranſgreſſing it. Such inſtruction he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. As, by the ſame means he learned, much ſooner than otherwiſe he would have done, who had given him exiſtence, on whom he depended, and from what ſource the manifold favours and bleſſings, with which he was ſo liberally encompaſſed, were derived; ſo he was brought to know what the religion of his nature was. He ſaw the fitneſs, he felt the obligation of loving and ſerving his Maker; of expreſſing his ſentiments of piety, dependence and gratitude, in ſuch ways only, and by ſuch acts of external homage as the Deity ſhould pleaſe to appoint. He perceived it to be right, therefore his duty, to ſubmit to the divine authority in all things, to obey his will, to do his pleaſure, in whatever inſtance made known; in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, with regard to that of his avoiding the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted tree. Had he kept his ſtation, as he might, had he opened and enlarged his rational faculties, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his advantages, and improved by thoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine hints that were afforded him; his ſenſe of right and of religious obligation would have been daily ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered more perfect and extenſive. But he tranſgreſſed; and by tranſgreſſion, the diſpenſation of ſtrict law ended; that of grace, under the Mediator, commenced; and ſin and death entered into the world. Whatever were the ability and advantages of man to keep his origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſtate and preſerve his primitive innocence, it is an inconteſtible fact, that his defection took place in conſequence of the firſt temptation. Scared hiſtory
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:016303_0012_0F9C1F6EA39B4BA0"/>mentions no other; nor have we any reaſon to think he ever reſiſted one. This, by the way, is no argument of his poſſeſſing ſupereminent intellectual powers, of moral diſcernment, above the common ſtandard of mankind.—He tranſgreſſed, and he muſt die. This is the juſt demerit and threatned penalty of ſin. His Creator, however, did not forſake him; but continued his providential care and watchfulneſs towards him. A plan of grace, on the foreſight of tranſgreſſion, had been previouſly laid in the divine counſels, whereby both the actual tranſgreſſor, and his poſterity, who were now born to die, were, in future time, to be reſtored to life, through him who is the reſurrection and the life. From this period, God has thought fit to treat with the creature man, by the mediation of his Son, opening and diſcovering divine truths to them, as they ſhould be able to bear them, and were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to profit by them. Such diſcoveries were made, at firſt, as appear to be adapted to the infant ſtate of the world. The knowledge which the firſt man had of the Deity, and of moral obligation and truth, he, doubtleſs, communicated to his poſterity. For, though he muſt have greatly felt the unhappy biaſs of a depraved heart, yet we know not that his intellectual powers, or meer knowledge of moral truth, were, at all, impaired by the tranſgreſſion. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary rather appears, as higher orders of beings, who have alſo ſinned, are, notwithſtanding, repreſented as being very ſagacious and knowing, though indiſpoſed to all good. But I hope, whatever may be true of individuals, or even whole nations, ſince, that it will not deſerve cenſure, if we do not carry the moral indiſpoſition of man, at this time, ſo far as to equal it with that of Devils. The notions, which he now had of a future ſtate and an immortal life after death,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:016303_0013_0F9C1F6FAB41CAA0"/>muſt, I think, have been collected out of that diſcourſe which God held with him after his defection.— The only poſſible idea he could have of immortality in innocence, is that of continuance in life—Obey and live. It did not accord with the nature of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation he was under, that he ſhould have any other. What he now believed about a future ſtate, he made known to his children, with the grounds of it. This called forth the exertion of their intellectual faculties, and they improved, grew wiſer, and had hope.—This hope God was pleaſed afterwards greatly to ſtrengthen, particularly by the tranſlation of Enoch, whoſe piety was conſpicuous. The reaſon of man was ſufficient, from hints, to deduce many important truths; and to ſee the fitneſs and obligation of ſeveral things, which, meerly of itſelf, would not have been ſo ſoon or eaſily diſcovered. Hence, I am inclined to think that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural religion is not ſo properly defined to be that, which mankind have, or might come to the knowledge of, meerly by the ſtrength of unaſſiſted reaſon; as that, which reaſon ſees to be right, and feels the force of, when it is known, What reaſon knows to be fit, what it aſſents to, approves and reſts ſatisfied in, when it is perceived, tho' it be offered to it, anſwers preciſely the ſame purpoſes as to religion and moral obligation, and indeed, as to its being the foundation and teſt of revelation itſelf, that it would do, were it diſcovered in its own ſtrength. To affirm, however, that the reaſon of man cannot come to the knowledge of God and his duty to him, by any contemplations and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of his own, is to ſay a great deal too much. Reaſon, properly employed, will make very great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries, and by attending to the conſtitution and order of things, be led up to their cauſe. This not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, had the immediate poſterity of Adam
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:016303_0014_0F9C1F7060216B08"/>received no light from him, or communications from the Deity, their progreſs in moral ſcience would, undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, have been very ſlow. It is evident, that God did not ſee fit to leave them, meerly, to their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigations. He ſuperadded his daily aſſiſtance to the powers of reaſon, with which he had endowed them. He manifeſted himſelf to them, and directed his own worſhip. There is no accounting for the early prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of ſacrificing on any other principle. Such care God has, certainly, taken of man from the beginning. He even condeſcended to reaſon with Cain, in regard to the miſtake he had made in his offering.</p>
            <p>Although natural religion is founded in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of God, and the relation man ſtands in to him; and is, therefore, unalrerably the ſame, whether under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by man or not; that is, it is an eternal truth, that the obligation of religion reſults from ſuch exiſtence and relations; yet this has not been diſcovered meerly by the faculty of reaſon, excluſive of aid: but it has had helps; it has been ſet to work; and when the diſcovery has been made, religion has been found to be altogether agreeable to the underſtanding: it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to and feels the force of it, and it can no more reject or call it in queſtion, than it can thoſe truths, which neceſſarily reſult from any other natural rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the agreement or diſagreement of ideas. We cannot, however, argue, from natural religion's being founded in relations that cannot but exiſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Deity and man, and the obligation of it being alike derived from this ſource on all, that the quantity thereof to each muſt therefore be the ſame. The notion of a general natural religion for the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race will, I truſt, on examination be found to be groundleſs, and no way conſonant to the nature of
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:016303_0015_0F9C1F7361DBE478"/>things. Natural religion hath reſpect not to collective bodies of men, much leſs to the whole maſs of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, but to individuals; each one has his own natural religion, and it is more or leſs as is the reaſon of each, or at leaſt, as it might be, were it duly exerciſed and improved. Indeed it makes no difference here, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we conſider the reaſon of each man as it is, or as it would be, had it been exerciſed and improved by every one to the utmoſt. In either caſe it is poſſeſſed in unequal portions. On the latter ſuppoſition, tho' each one would know more than he now does, or in other words, would have more reaſon than he now has, and conſequently, would have more natural religion; yet there would be as real a diverſity among men as there is at preſent:— That is, they would not all have the ſame quantity of reaſon, and, therefore, could not all have the ſame quantity of natural religion; the latter being always proportionate to the former.</p>
            <p>Every man is accepted according to that he hath, and not according to that he hath not. When the gifts of nature are ſmall, and the opportunities and advantages for the acquiſition of knowledge infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, the leſs will be required. From him to whom one or two talents are committed the ſame improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments will not be exacted as from him who hath had five:—For it is equally true on the plan of nature, as that of revelation, that, to whomſoever much is given, of him ſhall much be required. A ſufficiency is given on either plan by the benevolent author of both, if duly cultivated and improved, to promote and ſecure the happineſs of every one. Leſs capacities are filled with leſs enjoyments. It is, notwithſtanding a good, much to be deſired, to have our capacities enlarged, to know more of God and truth, natural and moral, that our
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:016303_0016_0F9C1F74C8FB1E38"/>happineſs may be alſo enlarged. The wiſe and good author of our nature hath, accordingly, ſo framed them, that happineſs is made to depend on ourſelves. It is unneceſſary, to obſerve, that I do not intend, it is ſo, excluſively of thoſe aids, which, from the perfections of the Deity, are to be expected under the law of nature; and from his promiſe, under the diſpenſation of grace. Happineſs, I ſay, depends on ourſelves; ariſes out of our own induſtry and progreſs in thoſe moral improvements, which are commonly made to better advantage by the means of natural ones. The one does not, indeed, neceſſarily follow from the other, as effects from cauſes; but there is a tendency in the latter to beget the former; though, at the ſame time, from the principle of human liberty, the effect may not be, and often is not, produced. The greater, however, and the more extenſive our knowledge is of natural, the greater may it be of moral truths. The more we know of the latter, the more may we love and embrace them, and conform to them, in temper and conduct towards God and the world around us. This is natural religion. From this happineſs reſults. When we conſider the intellectual powers of human nature, as original faculties to attain knowledge by aid and ſuggeſtion; to improve every degree thereof; to extend and enlarge it; to argue, by this means, the being and perfection of the Deity from his works, and the obligation of the ſeveral duties we owe him, in due and proper order, from his attributes; it is not eaſy to ſpeak in too exalted ſtrains of them.—They are truly great and noble. They have in many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances been carried far. To what lengths they might be puſhed, even in this ſtate, in regard of both natural and moral ſcience, did not the decay and diſſolution of the body hinder enquiry, is impoſſible to determine.
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:016303_0017_0F9C1F755100A170"/>Of this, however, we are certain, that the larger the ſtock of ſcience is in any mind, the better it is able to advance; the farther it goes, the farther may it go, and the clearer will be it's apprehenſions of there being things, yet to be known; and the progreſs might be endleſs, as, in the other ſtate, it will, doubtleſs, be ſtrictly ſo. The moſt rational and conſiſtent notion we can form of the condition of good men in heaven, is, that of continual advances in knowledge and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; approaching towards the Deity, and perfecting their image of him. Hence happineſs muſt ariſe, and increaſe in juſt proportion. But if the rational faculties of man are ſuppoſed to be left to diſcover truths meerly in their own ſtrength, without aid or intimation, it will then be very difficult to ſay how great they will ever ſhew themſelves, or what they may poſſibly do. It is not manifeſt, that the trial has ever yet been made; the contrary rather appears. And hence it may be juſtly inferred, that the wiſe and benevolent author of our beings never deſigned, that the creature man, who was ſo admirably formed, with capacities to receive by inſtruction and improve upon every hint, ſhould be left to the ſlow and uncertain acquiſition of, and progreſs in knowledge, by the ſole exertion of his own faculties. The argument from what man can now do, with the helps he has had, inſtructed and enlightened as he is, to what he would, or could have done, without theſe advantages, is inconcluſive and illuſory. Let the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures we have made, in regard to the firſt man, turn out as they may, however great his knowledge, or in what way ſoever he came by it, learned men, who have made the moſt philoſophical enquiries, generally agree, that his poſterity came into the world deſtitute of knowledge, or even the materials of it, having only capacities to receive it.</p>

The opinion of innate ideas and principles, which prevailed for ſo long a time, is now, almoſt, univerſally given up; and that of the human mind receiving them afterwards diſtinct and ſimple; comparing, compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and diſpoſing of them, together with the percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe operations, is adopted in its room, as the original of knowledge. Succeeding generations are ſuppoſed, in the mean time, to have the aſſiſtance of thoſe who have gone before; for it appears to be the plan of providence, that in addition to theſe ſources, and beſides the communications, at any time, afforded by the Deity, man ſhould help man; parents teach their children; and, in the prophetic ſtile, many run to and fro, and knowledge be increaſed. What truths man poſſibly could diſcover, in the due exerciſe of his rational faculties without aid, is one thing; what he probably would, is another.</p>
            <p>The moſt celebrated philoſophers have not pretended to inveſtigate the moſt important truths of the moral kind, whereof they had no knowledge, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſo much as aimed to eſtabliſh thoſe on fixed principles, and render them plainer by their reaſoning, which have been handed down to them by tradition. This is the caſe with ſeveral; with that weighty one, a future ſtate of retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution in particular. And what ſhall we ſay in regard to the cleareſt and moſt fundamental truth in nature, that which is the baſis of all other truth? In what age or country has he lived, and what is his name, or his ſon's name, who, without any previous intimation, meerly by deduction and argument, has, in fact, proved the divine exiſtence? Though it is moſt undeniably to be done from the things that are made; yet who has ever been put to the neceſſity of doing it? If we look among the ancient or modern philoſophers, who have
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:016303_0019_0F9C1F76CCC6DFC0"/>attempted the proof of the divine Being and perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, either by arguments <hi>a priori</hi> or <hi>a poſteriori,</hi> do we not find them before poſſeſſed of the moſt eſſentially neceſſary truth? The fact is, that it has been tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted from the beginning, and ſpread among all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and this has precluded the neceſſity of that proof, which is very capable of being made; and indeed if it be allowed that the divine exiſtence is moſt inconteſtibly to be argued from his works (and what can be more manifeſt?) and if the reaſon of man, in proper exerciſe, can ſee, and does ſee that it is ſo; where then is the harm, and what can be riſqued, by ſuppoſing, as appears to be the caſe, that God has been before hand with us, as he is, with reſpect to many favours, and has given us intimations of himſelf prior to our reaſoning about him?</p>
            <p>To what has been advanced, I think the authority of St. Paul cannot be oppoſed, who hath ſaid, The inviſible things of him ſince the creation of the world, are clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and god-head; ſo that they are without excuſe. The Apoſtle is here ſpeaking of the heathens, but for what does he blame them? And on what account were they without excuſe? Was it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did not ſeek after and find the true God, from his works, whom they had never before known? Does he not repreſent them as knowing God already, but not glorifying him as God? As not liking to retain him in their knowledge? And as holding the truth in unrighteouſneſs, becauſe that which may be known of God, is manifeſt in them, for God hath ſhewed it unto them? And does he not ſpeak of them, as being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excuſe; becauſe they had ſo far loſt the knowledge they once had of him, as to change the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:016303_0020_0F9C1F7792AB1938"/>man, and to birds and four footed beaſts, and creeping things; when, at the ſame time, they had ſo clear and ſtriking an argument, before their eyes, of the inviſible things of him; even his eternal power and godhead, as the things that are made did afford them? and had afforded all mankind, ever ſince they were made? This is evidently the ſcope of the Apoſtle's reaſoning; and the argument is truly powerful and convincing; there is no reſiſting its force, where pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per attention is given, If the things that are made are ſufficient to prove the being, as cannot be denied, much more are they ſo, to preſerve the knowledge, of God, in every rational mind. And the intellectual faculties of men, duly employed, cannot but conſent to this, and immediately perceive it to be ſo. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excuſe, therefore, muſt they be, to loſe the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him, after they have once had it, and change the truth of God into a lie, and worſhip and ſerve the creature more than the Creator, who is bleſſed forever.</p>
            <p>On what has been, thus far, diſcourſed of man; the capacities he is endowed with; the means he enjoys of knowing God, and his duty to him; and the proportionate religion of his nature, ſeveral things may be noticed.</p>
            <p>Firſt, we may obſerve, with the moſt undiſſembled piety and gratitude, that the divine care of man, in every period, has been ſuited to the circumſtances he came under; commenſurate to the exigencies of his condition; and calculated to open and enlarge his views of moral ſcience, and the moſt fundamental principles of natural religion. In innocence, his Creator was his friend and patron, his daily protector and guide; and this, in a way ſo conſiſtent with that
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:016303_0021_0F9C1F790D926168"/>liberty and active power with which he was endowed, as to leave room for merit and ſelf-ſatisfaction in the exerciſe of his own faculties. When he had ſinned, he did not depart from him, and abandon him to the horrors of deſpair and ruin. Highly diſpleaſed and diſhonored, as he certainly was, with his tranſgreſſion; and notwithſtanding the fulleſt teſtimony he bore againſt it; ſhewing his extreameſt abhorrence, by ſuffering the conſequences thereof to come on, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the threatning; "in the day that thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely die;" yet he took occaſion, from this very act, to make farther diſcoveries of his grace and kindneſs. He applied remedies againſt the prevalency of ſin and luſt, which had now entered into the world, and corrected and reſtrained their growth, by new inſtructions and appointments, adapted to the degraded condition of humanity. He took the moſt effectual meaſures, had they been regarded, to preſerve and ſpread the knowledge of himſelf and his worſhip in the world; and finally, to procure the reſtoration of men, from the darkneſs of death to a ſtate of immortal life and glory. The paternal care which God ſaw fit to take of man, from the beginning of his weakneſs and depravity, and the wiſe and gracious methods he has all along purſued, to convey the moſt uſeful inſtruction to him, and keep a ſenſe of religion and moral obligation in his heart, cannot be recollected by us, in the preſent age of the world, who ſo richly enjoy the benefits hereof, but with the moſt pleaſing aſtoniſhment and gratitude. By favoring man, with many appearances from the angel of his preſence, he declared himſelf and his ways to them, as far as the neceſſity of their temporal concerns would admit, and their capacities were able to improve and receive ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by ſuch inſtructions: He communicated the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:016303_0022_0F9C1F79CC73CE20"/>ſpirit of prophecy to many, and ſome have ſuppoſed, as from ſeveral intimations in ſacred hiſtory it appears not improbable, that he made it "hereditary, in the heads of families;" and for many years men enjoyed the benefit of the tradition of the moſt uſeful and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant truths, by the means of longevity, through but very few hands. "There were but two generations from Adam to Noah. So that we cannot well ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that the knowledge and true worſhip of God, during that time, Could be entirely loſt, in any part of the world."</p>
            <p>After the general deluge, conſidering what had ſo recently happened, to manifeſt the divine diſpleaſure againſt iniquity, and make his power known, and alſo that the world was, as it were, beginning anew; the moſt eſſential truths of natural religion, as they were acknowledged, might be very well left, for ſome time, to traditionary conveyance, and the common reaſoning of mankind, without any new communications from the Deity. But no ſooner did men begin to fall away. and corrupt and darken their notions of the one ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme God, and incline to idolatry, than he ſaw fit to interpoſe to prevent it, and to take various methods to invigorate the impreſſion of himſelf, and ſome of the moſt leading and eſſential truths, and enforce the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of religious homage. And when, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the paternal care, which God exerciſed over his offspring, they had grown too generally refractory and diſobedient, obliterating their natural notions of him, and corrupting the firſt principles of reaſon, even ſo far as to darken their underſtandings, and render themſelves unfit ſubjects of the divine communications: inſomuch that he was, as it were, obliged to withhold favors of this ſort, as being no longer ſuitable for
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:016303_0023_0F9C1F7A974F8F50"/>them. This, I ſay, being the caſe, he did not fail to make uſe of other means, which had now become more adapted to the obſcurity of their underſtandings, and the depravity of their hearts, to do them good; to recover their loſt notions of God, and the religion of their nature. He raiſed up and furniſhed certain individuals of mankind, who had retained more juſt and rational notions of the Deity and their duty to him, and of the general obligations of religious fear, worſhip and obedience, than the reſt, to guide, teach and inſtruct them, as both themſelves and theſe had before been taught of God. For this important pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, Abraham was called and very much diſtinguiſhed, together with his poſterity, by notable diſcoveries of God and religion, and many benefits and privileges, both of a temporal and ſpiritual kind. But, as a very eminently learned and judicious writer has obſerved, —"we cannot think, that it was ſo much on his own account, that he was thus diſtinguiſhed; or that, for his ſake only, faith, or ſincerity, is ſaid to be imputed to him for righteouſneſs; but rather for the common benefit of mankind was all this done; in order to make him an inſtrument, in the hand of providence (and a fit one he was) to convey the ſame faith and fear of God to all the nations round him." And beſides Abraham, there were many other perſons, ſpread abroad in almoſt every nation, who were burning and ſhining lights, in dark ages and places; and who, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the too great prevalency of idolatry, had preſerved, ſome of them, conſiderably pure and rational, others, by far more conſiſtent notions of the one true God, than the generality. Even the ſpirit of prophecy, which had been poſſeſſed by many, before Abraham's time, did not utterly ceaſe among the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral nations, in his day, nor ſoon after it, There
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:016303_0024_0F9C1F7CD3C53BC8"/>were alſo other means of conveying divine admonitions to men, and ſome were inſtructed by viſions and revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; whereby the knowledge of God and natural reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was, in ſome meaſure, kept up in the world. But that, which had the moſt direct and diſtinguiſhed ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to enlighten mankind; to reform their idolatrous practices and vices; and to recover and diffuſe, among all nations, proper conceptions of the power, juſtice and majeſty of the God of nature, and the religious obedience which he required and would accept of reaſonable beings, was his afterwards giving a written law to the Jews; ſtatutes and judgments, more righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous than thoſe of other nations; and making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as it were, the political head of their ſtate; guiding and regulating their moral governmental and eccleſiaſtic affairs. In every part of which he ſeems to have had in view the ſame divine intention, which he had proſecuted from the firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> That of applying to, calling forth and aiding the human reaſon; and adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his providential care to the circumſtances and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of mankind. God had before, in various inſtances, revealed his will to particular perſons for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon benefit; that is, he had made it known, at ſuch times, and in ſuch ways and degrees, as he ſaw beſt ſuited to accompliſh his benevolent purpoſe of informing mens minds, and giving ſpring to the exertion of their rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal faculties; but he never had, 'till now, written his law for their conſtant peruſal. The learned Biſhop, to whom I am already indebted, and ſome others, have ſuppoſed, with great probability, that Moſes was divinely taught on this occaſion, and that this was the origin of letters. Nor was the law confined to the Jewiſh nation; it had reſpect alſo to the ſtranger: And all nations had, and were originally deſigned to have, a ſhare of bleſſings, in the adoption and bleſſing of
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:016303_0025_0F9C1F7F9F7A5598"/>Abraham, and the giving of the law. Accordingly the Jews were made uſe of, in a great variety of ways, for the grand end of ſpreading the doctrine of the divine unity thro' the world, and reſtoring and eſtabliſhing the eſſential principles of natural religion. Whether they purſued their own inclination, in many inſtances, and aimed to be bleſſings to other nations or not, is of no conſequence to enquire; ſince, in either caſe, the divine plan is carried forward; and "the reſt of the world reap almoſt the ſame benefit by them, whether they keep their law and proſper, or diſobey it and are in diſtreſs." By their rewards and by their puniſhments, by their victories, and by their captivities, the name of Jehovah is made known, and the great truths of religion ſpread abroad and confirmed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is a juſt and obvious remark from the foregoing diſcourſe, that the divine conduct towards men in the ſeveral ages of the world, and in all the darkneſs and diverſity of their circumſtances, has been calculated to furniſh their minds with ſuch degrees of light and knowledge, in regard to their moral ſtate, and the neceſſities of nature, as to diſpoſe them for the caſier reception of the goſpel revelation, when it ſhould be offered to them, and for the many diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed privileges and advantages, which it brings along with it. Men ſee their wants by the means of light, and their having been accuſtomed to receive it, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares them for more. They can in reaſon, have no prejudice againſt new diſcoveries, when they have been uſed to old ones; or to further and more perfect aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance when they have already had ſome, though more reſtrained and par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ial; yet always ſuch as was beſt adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their moral circumſtances. The chriſtian diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation may be properly conſidered, as the perfection
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:016303_0026_0F9C1F81167C2638"/>of the general plan of conduct in this world, purſued by the Deity with reſpect to the human race from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. He early began in diverſe ways and manners to give them juſt notions of the religion of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and by his ſeveral diſpenſations, has been uniform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carrying forward the ſame deſign; 'till it at length iſſued in the ſuperior light and advantage of the goſpel revelation. It is not eſſential to the juſt and proper notion of natural religion, that it ſhould be diſcovered, by the meer ſtrength of human reaſon; it is ſufficient if it be conſonant to reaſon, and founded in nature The way and manner of knowing it, does not come into the account; or make it more or leſs natural religion.</p>
            <p>Let a part of the human race, in ſome dark corner of the earth, be ſuppoſed totally ignorant of all the natural religion that ever was in the world; let a few of them be now ſo happy, as to diſcover it by contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, and the proper uſe of their own faculties; and let them communicate it to the reſt. In this caſe, I aſk would it not be equally natural religion in them all? And would it make any difference here, if the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation ſhould proceed from ſome other quarter, or even from the Deity? If it has its foundation in the divine perfections, and the relation there is between God and man; is not this enough to conſtitute it the religion of nature, in whatever way men are ſuppoſed to come to the knowledge of it? To ſpeak, therefore, of what is called natural religion and revealed, as though they were totally diſtinct, and eſſentially and ſubſtantially different, is, I believe, to give an undue repreſentation of them both; and to adminiſter very unneceſſary ſupport to the cauſe of infidelity. The grand deſign of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in every inſtance, has been, either di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly or conſequentially to open, enlarge and eſtabliſh
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:016303_0027_0F9C1F814DFA3B58"/>the genuine principles of natural religion; that is, the religion that is adapted to the nature and circumſtances of the creature, man. In this way, and with this deſign, the benevolent Father of the univerſe has gone on, with reſpect to the human race, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning down to the preſent time; riſing in the perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity and fulneſs of his manifeſtations; until he ſaw fit, in the unfathomable depths of his wiſdom, to bleſs the world with the Goſpel revelation, and the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of his grace, under the immediate conduct and adminiſtration of the Son of his love; wherein the great principles and duties of natural religion are more perfectly taught, explained and underſtood; and more clearly and authoritatively enforced and confirmed, than they had ever before been under any former diſpenſation. There is now, by the means of the Goſpel, more natural religion in the world than the reaſon of man, with all the aſſiſtance and inſtruction that has been given it, had ever before brought him acquainted with; inſomuch, that it may be truly affirmed, that thoſe ſocieties, or even individuals, who have the moſt Chriſtianity, have alſo the moſt natural religion among them. It muſt, indeed, be confeſſed, to the praiſe of the divine grace, that the Goſpel has made glorious diſcoveries of things, which the reaſon of man could never come to the knowledge of, but by revelation. They are, however, ſuch as have a tendency to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the principles, and oblige us to the practice of the ſeveral duties of natural religion. The general doctrine of the mediation of Chriſt, and it's appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dages; that of atonement and juſtification in his merits; and, indeed, the ſeveral offices, executed by him, in the great and glorious work of redemption, have for their object, the giving men juſt views of the divine character; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> ſenſe of their own,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:016303_0028_0F9C1F821FCBB5A0"/>and the ſtate they are in; forming them to proper tempers towards God and one another, and leading them to a correſpondent conduct: So that the ſcheme of Chriſtianity is calculated to ſubdue ſin, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grades human nature; and to direct and influence men to act according to it's law, which dignifies and exalts it. But I paſs on to obſerve,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That if the Deity has ſeen fit all along to aid the reaſon of man by frequent diſcoveries, according to its neceſſities, as we have heard, them no objection can be juſtly formed againſt revelation in general; nor of conſequence againſt the chriſtian revelation in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, which is no other than his continuing to do the ſame. It has been ſaid, with great reaſon and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, "That the ſeveral diſpenſations of what we call revealed religion, have hitherto been, in the main, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to thoſe of providence, in both the natural and moral world." And if ſo, then revealed religion "may poſſibly come from the ſame author, and receive yet farther increaſe, which theſe alſo do, as they are better underſtood."</p>
            <p>It is indeed owing, in part to the greater improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which later ages have made in general ſcience and literature, than former ages had done, that the modern Deiſts know more, and more they do certainly know than their predeceſſors, the ancient philoſophers. But this is chiefly to be attributed to the advantage of the chriſtian revelation, which has been a rich bleſſing, even to thoſe who do not believe in it. One would be ready to imagine that we meet the Deiſts on their own ground, and give them all their wiſhes, when we undertake to ſhew that the chriſtian revelation is the fulfilment and perfection of the ſame plan, which the
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:016303_0029_0F9C1F82DC7504D8"/>Deity has purſued with men, from the firſt; and that the great aim and tendency of it is to give them more juſt and enlarged notions of the principles, and more ſtrongly to oblige them to the duties of natural re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Whether this be the caſe or not, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves will allow, is worthy their moſt ſerious conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
            <p>The diſcourſe, we have now had, may remind us all of the ſingular advantages we enjoy, in this age of light and inprovement, both to know and do our duty. But I cannot help felicitating my young brethren the Students of this univerſity, in particular, on the peculiar bleſſedneſs of their ſituation, and the proſpects they have before them. In this ſeat of learning, kind Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence has honored them with privileges above the common portion of mankind; or even of thoſe who are figuratively ſaid to be lifted up to heaven, with respect to theirs. And if they deſire to anſwer the juſt and reaſonable expectations of God, their friends or their country from them, it ſhould be their care, that their literary and religious accompliſhments riſe in ſome proportion to ſuch happy enjoyments. When we are told of their general virtues, their regular behavior, their eaſy ſubmiſſion to the good orders, inſtruction and government of this ſociety; or of their honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves and this favored ſeminary, by their lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary performances, we are glad: Rejoicing in their perſonal glory, and wiſhing them every bleſſing, we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate the happineſs of future time, when they ſhall be called forth to act their parts in places of truſt and eminence both in church and ſtate. But we are made ſorry with every report of a different kind, and conſole ourſelves only with the hope, that it cannot be true. We, who have trod the paths of ſcience before them,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:016303_0030_0F9C1F8392DBA6E8"/>may poſſibly, as we do moſt willingly, afford them our friendly aid, but they muſt not think to bound their progreſs in literature by the limits that have been ſet to ours. They muſt go beyond us. They enjoy happy opportunities for this. Their advantages, by means of daily improvements, are better than ours were. And if they do not ſurpaſs us, they will have a greater account to give up before God at laſt. In addition to human literature, and the aſſiduous culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the liberal arts and ſciences, which will lead them to an eaſier and more extenſive acquaintance with the foundations both of natural and revealed religion, their minds muſt be furniſhed with divine ſcience. They muſt acquire and cheriſh the moſt reverential thoughts of the holy Scriptures, which are able to make them wiſe unto ſalvation. Their hearts muſt be repleniſhed with the divine grace. They muſt know God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom he hath ſent, whom to know is eternal life. Wiſdom is the principal thing: Therefore, get wiſdom; but with all thy getting, got underſtanding.</p>
