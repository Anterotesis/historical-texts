            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A <hi>TREATY</hi> between His Excellency the Governor of the Province of <hi>New-York,</hi> and the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> and other <hi>Indian</hi> Nations, depending on ſaid Province.</head>
            <p>IT is well known in the Province of <hi>New-York,</hi> that the <hi>Six Nations</hi> of <hi>Indians</hi> depending in this Province, (called <hi>Iroquois</hi> by the <hi>French</hi>) had lately on ſeveral Occaſions, appear'd diſſatisfied and wavering in their Fidelity to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Crown. No doubt, this was principally occaſion'd by the Artifices of the <hi>French</hi> of <hi>Canada,</hi> who had conſtantly Emiſſaries among them: But at the ſame Time there is Reaſon to think, the ſuſpicious Behaviour of theſe Nations, in Favour of their once inveterate Enemy the <hi>French,</hi> could not have arriv'd to the Pitch it did, otherwiſe than by ſome Neglects or Miſconduct of thoſe who were entruſted by the Government of <hi>New-York</hi> with the Management of the <hi>Indian</hi> Affairs.</p>
            <p>His Excellency the Governor of <hi>New-York,</hi> having received his Majeſty's Commands, to engage the <hi>Indian</hi> Nations depending on his Government, to join in the Expedition then intended againſt <hi>Canada,</hi> and to make them the uſual Preſents on that Occaſion; and being ſenſible of the great Uſe theſe <hi>Nations</hi> may be to the Succeſs of this Enterprize, and likewiſe of the Difficulties that probably might attend his Endeavours at this Time, was deſirous to have had the Aſſiſtance of as many of the Members of his Majeſty's Council as the Circumſtances of Affairs would permit; but they all declined to give their Attendance, except Mr. <hi>Colden</hi> and Mr. <hi>Living ſton.</hi> His Excellency was therefore obliged to act with the ſmalleſt Number of Members, which by his Majeſty's Commiſſion can form a Council, <hi>viz.</hi> Three; the above two Gentlemen and Capt. <hi>Rutherford,</hi> who was then at his Poſt in <hi>Albany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As ſoon as his Excellency received his Majeſty's Commands, he diſpatched from <hi>Albany</hi> ſuch Perſons as, by the beſt Information he could receive, had Influence among the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> to invite them ſeverally to meet him at <hi>Albany,</hi> on the 20<hi>th</hi> of <hi>July.</hi> His Excellency arrived at <hi>Albany</hi> the 21<hi>ſt</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> where having heard, that, beſides the Small-Pox, (which his Excellency never had) many were ſick of a contagious malignant Fever, he continued on board the Sloop which carried him up, to conſider where to lodge with the leaſt Danger to his Perſon from the Infection of theſe Diſtempers; and the next Morning reſolved to go into the Fort. He was received at his Landing with the uſual Marks of Reſpect from the Corporation, the Independent Companies of regular Troops then in the Place, and the Militia, under a Diſcharge of the Cannon of the Fort and Town.</p>
            <p>In the Afternoon of the ſame Day on which his Excellency came on Shore, three <hi>Indians, viz.</hi> Two <hi>Onandagos</hi> and an <hi>Oneydo,</hi> brought two <hi>French</hi> Scalps and preſented to his Excellency: At which Time the Leader of the Party made a formal Speech to the following Purpoſe: <q>That having had repeated Accounts of the Miſchief done by the <hi>French,</hi> and of the frequent Murders committed by them, and that the <hi>Mohawks,</hi> notwithſtanding of their Profeſſions of Friendſhip, ſuffered this Bloodſhed to remain unrevenged, 
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:005791_0003_1026EEA68E38FDC0"/>
his Heart could bear it no longer; he thereupon reſolved to open for his Brethren the Path to Revenge: That theſe two Scalps which he now preſented were taken at Noon Day in Sight of the <hi>French</hi> Fort at <hi>Crown Point.</hi>
               </q> His Excellency told him how well he took this ſpecial Mark of his Fidelity, and aſſured him, that he would not only now reward him and his Companions, by particular Preſents, but would always remember this Act of Friendſhip. They had already received the Reward given by the Act of Aſſembly. His Excellency gave each of them four <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Dollars; to the Leader a fine laced Coat and Hat, and a Silver Breaſt-Plate; and to each of the others a Stroud Blanket and lac'd Hat.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Indians</hi> told us, that they lay ſeveral Days among the Buſhes, from whence they could ſee every Man that came out of the Fort-Gate. They endeavoured for ſome time to take a Priſoner, but obſerving that none went to ſuch a Diſtance from the Fort that they could hope to carry him off, they reſolved to take the firſt Opportunity for a Scalp: Two Soldiers coming out of the Fort, after the Chapel Bell had rung about Noon, one of the <hi>Indians,</hi> by their Leader's Order, fired with Swan Shot upon them while they were near to each other. It is a conſtant Rule among theſe ſculking Parties, never to fire without Orders from their Leader. One of the <hi>French</hi> Men was killed upon the Spot, the other wounded and fled immediately towards the Fort Gate, the <hi>Indian</hi> who had fired, purſu'd, and with his Hatchet brought him down within a hundred Steps of the Fort Gate; and, tho' the <hi>French</hi> in the Fort ruſhed out at the Gate, he took his Scalp off; the others had ſcalped the Man that was firſt killed, and then they all fled. The <hi>French</hi> in their Hurry had run out without their Arms, and upon recollecting themſelves return'd to Arm, which facilitated the Eſcape of the <hi>Indians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Excellency being informed, that the Leader of this Party was deſirous to be diſtinguiſhed by his Excellency's giving him a new Name, and that the Name —, which in the Language of the <hi>Six Nations</hi> ſignifies the <hi>Path-opener,</hi> would be moſt acceptable to him; his Excellency honour'd him with that Title; which he accepted very thankfully, and ſeem'd exceedingly pleaſed with it: Whereupon he ſaid, that the other two <hi>Indians</hi> having aſſociated with a <hi>Mehikander,</hi> or River <hi>Indian,</hi> were reſolved to go out againſt the Enemy: But as he thought he might be more uſeful by ſtaying, to aſſiſt at the enſuing Treaty, he was reſolved to remain here. He added, that in Caſe the Interpreter, and others ſent to invite the <hi>Six Nations</hi> to meet here, fail'd in any Part, he would go among the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> and doubted not to bring many by his Influence, who otherwiſe might ſtay.</p>
            <p>In a Day or too after, ſix of ſeven <hi>Indians,</hi> who had been ſent out by the Commiſſioners for <hi>Indian</hi> Affairs to <hi>Crown-Point,</hi> to take Priſoners and gain Intelligence, returned and ſaid, That they had gone to that Place, and that in Sight of it they had ſeparated, with Deſign thereby to ſurprize any Stragler that might have come out of the Fort: That while they were thus ſeparated, two of their Number were ſuddenly ſurrounded and taken by the Enemy: One of theſe two, after having been detained three or four Days, join'd the others at <hi>Saraghtoga.</hi> He ſaid, that he had been threatned with Death by the <hi>Adirondax</hi>
               <note place="bottom">(<hi>a</hi>) A Nation of <hi>Indians</hi> living in <hi>Canada,</hi> who have always been firm Friends to the <hi>French,</hi> and formerly were at War with the <hi>Six Nations.</hi>

               </note> interpos'd, and by their 
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:005791_0004_1026EEA82C66CE58"/>
Interceſſion he was ſet at Liberty; and ſome of the <hi>Cahnuagas</hi> conducted him through <hi>Lac Sacrement.</hi> He reported, that there was a great Number of Men, <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> at <hi>Crown-Point.</hi> The other Priſoner, an <hi>Onondaga,</hi> conſented to remain with the <hi>French,</hi> and was ſent to <hi>Canada.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Soon after this, ſixteen <hi>Mohawk</hi> Indians came to the Town, who had been ſent out, from the lower <hi>Mohawk</hi> Caſtle by Mr. <hi>Johnſon,</hi> to gain Intelligence near <hi>Crown-Point,</hi> and to take Priſoners. They reported, that they had diſcovered ſo great a Number of <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> at <hi>Crown-Point,</hi> that they had no Hopes of being able to bring off any Priſoners, and thought it adviſeable to return ſpeedily and inform of the great Danger they thought this Place was in. His Excellency invited them to go thither again, in order to deſcry the Motions of the Enemy: And as a farther Encouragement to them, to either Scalp or take Priſoners, he offered every Perſon of ſaid Party that ſhould take a Scalp or Priſoner, a Piece of Stroud, and a Suit of laced Cloaths, beſides the Bounty; but they, being frightned with the Apprehenſions of Danger, declined going back, and ſaid, they muſt return Home and acquaint their Friends and Relations with what they had heard and ſeen. Several other <hi>Indians</hi> likewiſe alarmed the <hi>Mohawks,</hi> by telling them that the <hi>French</hi> had a great Force at <hi>Crown-Point,</hi> and that they would certainly attack either <hi>Albany</hi> or <hi>Schenectade,</hi> or the Settlements on the <hi>Mohawks</hi> River, or perhaps ſeveral Places at the ſame Time.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Johnſon,</hi> and the commanding Officer of the Garriſon of regular Troops in the <hi>Mohawks</hi> Country, by their Letters to his Excellency, confirm'd theſe Reports; and added, the <hi>Mohawks</hi> had entertain'd Apprehenſions of the <hi>French</hi> Force at <hi>Crown Point,</hi> which was like to have a bad Effect. On this his Excellency wrote to Mr. <hi>Johnſon,</hi> that all theſe Stories of the <hi>French</hi> Force at <hi>Crown Point,</hi> were only Artifices of the <hi>French</hi> to intimidate the <hi>Indians,</hi> or to amuſe them, with Deſign to fruſtrate the Treaty which he intended to have with them; and that he was to aſſure the <hi>Indians,</hi> that they could be in no Danger from the <hi>French</hi>: However, that they might ſee that he would omit nothing which they think neceſſary for their Security, he had ordered a Lieutenant of Militia with Thirty Men to reinforce the lower Caſtle, and had likewiſe ordered the Captain of Militia near the upper Caſtle, to aſſiſt the <hi>Indians</hi> there in fortifying their Caſtle, and to hold himſelf in Readineſs to ſupport them on any Emergency.</p>
            <p>One <hi>John Colan</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Man, who ſome Years ſince had removed from <hi>Canada,</hi> and ſettled and married at <hi>Schenectade,</hi> and who has ſince that Time lived in good Reputation there, was ſent by Major <hi>Glen,</hi> to inform his Excellency, that one <hi>Aaron,</hi> a noted <hi>Mohawk</hi> Sachem, who with ſeveral others of the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> had been laſt Spring in <hi>Canada</hi> to treat with the Governor there, did then entertain two <hi>Cahnuaga</hi> Indians. This Man, <hi>John Colan,</hi> acquainted his Excellency, that having diſcovered the <hi>Cahnuaga</hi> Indians, he told them he was a <hi>French</hi> Man, and was deſirous of returning to his own Country, on which they began preſently to propoſe to him Methods for his Eſcape; at which Time, this <hi>Aaron</hi> coming near them, he expreſs'd his Fears of being diſcovered by him. They anſwered, that he need not fear <hi>Aaron,</hi> for he was their Friend, and deſigned to go with them. As they propoſed to him to eſcape privately by himſelf, and to meet them at a Place they named, he told them of his Fears, in that Caſe, of meeting with the <hi>French</hi> Indians while he was alone. They anſwered, that if he dreſs'd himſelf like an <hi>Indian,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Indians would do him no Hurt, without firſt 
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005791_0005_1026EEA9F21C2BB8"/>
calling to him; upon which, if he ſtopp'd and call'd out <hi>Maria,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Indians would be ſo far from hurting him, that they would immediately come up to him and take him by the Hand. From this, and ſeveral other Incidents, which it would be tedious to relate, his Excellency was convinced of ſome ſecret Underſtanding between the <hi>Six Nations</hi> and the <hi>Cahnuagas,</hi> or <hi>French</hi> Indians: And that, however any Party of our <hi>Indians</hi> might be induced to fall upon the <hi>French,</hi> they would not at that Time moleſt the <hi>French</hi> Indians, nor prevent the Miſchiefs which the Inhabitants received from their ſeulking Parties.</p>
            <p>For this Reaſon, his Excellency endeavoured to ſend out again the Company of Rangers, which had formerly been employed againſt the ſculking <hi>Indians</hi>: But, as the Aſſembly had made no Proviſion for this Expence, they refuſed to go, unleſs he gave his perſonal Bond for their Pay, at <hi>Three Shillings</hi> a Day for each private Man, beſides their Proviſion; and would not be ſatisfied with the Promiſes that he, by the Advice of Council, made them of recommending their Service to the General Aſſembly, and the Aſſurances he gave them of their being rewarded as they deſired.</p>
            <p>On their continuing obſtinate, his Excellency was of Opinion, that no conſiderable Service could be expected from Men, who were moved by no other Principle but that of exceſſive Wages: And he had Reaſon afterwards to be confirmed in this Opinion, when Capt. <hi>Langdon,</hi> and afterwards Capt. <hi>Thebout,</hi> voluntarily went with their Companies of the new levied Troops to ſcour the Woods, and took ſome of theſe <hi>Albany</hi> Men with them as Guides, who whenever they apprehended themſelves in Danger, by the Diſcovery of recent Tracts, ſome one or other of them could not be kept from firing their Guns, or making ſome Noiſe, by which the <hi>French</hi> Indians, if any were near them, muſt know how to avoid them. Some <hi>Indians,</hi> who were likewiſe ſent out in Company with theſe Men, complained in like Manner.</p>
            <p>The publick Interpreter, whom the Governor (as before obſerved) had ſent with others, to invite the <hi>Six Nations</hi> to meet him at <hi>Albany,</hi> wrote to the Commiſſioners for <hi>Indian</hi> Affairs, That they met with great Diſſiculties and Obſtructions from the <hi>Sachems,</hi> who had been lately at <hi>Canada</hi>: That the <hi>Oneydoes</hi> refuſed to give any Anſwer, tho' they had ſtayed there thirteen Days endeavouring to perſuade them; and that the <hi>Cayugas</hi> had abſolutely refuſed to meet the Governor. On which his Excellency deſired to be informed by the Commiſſioners of <hi>Indian</hi> Affairs, whether they knew of any Perſon of Influence or Intereſt with the <hi>Indians,</hi> and fit to be ſent among them on this Occaſion. They anſwered, that they knew of none; and that the <hi>Indians</hi> were in a very bad Diſpoſition, and much under the Influence of the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About this time his Excellency being informed, that the Interpreter, and others ſent with him, had neglected to ſend proper Invitations to the <hi>Indians</hi> living on the Branches of <hi>Suſquehannah</hi> River; and that Capt. <hi>Vroman,</hi> of <hi>Scohary,</hi> was a proper Perſon to be ſent to thoſe <hi>Indians</hi>; he ſent him, in Company with Capt. <hi>Staats,</hi> with a Belt of <hi>Wampum</hi> to invite them.</p>
            <p>While the <hi>Indian</hi> Affairs appear'd in this diſcouraging State, an Account came to Town, that about Twenty young <hi>Chickaſaws</hi> were come to the <hi>Senekas,</hi> to deſire them to ſhew them the Way to <hi>Canada.</hi> The <hi>Chickeſaws</hi> had always been Enemies to the <hi>French</hi>: A Party of about Five Hundred Men had four Years ſince been ſent out againſt them from <hi>Canada,</hi> who were ſo entirely routed by the <hi>Chickeſaws</hi> that few returned. Theſe young 
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005791_0006_1026EEAC5AE19398"/>
               <hi>Chickeſaws</hi> told the <hi>Senekas,</hi> that the <hi>French</hi> of <hi>Canada</hi> had about four Years ſince made them a Viſit, and were ſo kind to leave them four Hundred Guns, which were now wore out; and, ſince the <hi>French</hi> had not thought fit to bring them any more Guns, they were reſolved to go to <hi>Canada</hi> to fetch new Ones; and promiſed, that if the <hi>Senekas</hi> would ſhew them the Way, they would go Home and return with four Hundred ſtout Fellows. Some other <hi>Indian</hi> Nations who lived to the Weſtward, diſcovering their Averſion to the <hi>French</hi> at the ſame Time, theſe Incidents aſſiſted the Governor's Meſſengers in bringing more <hi>Indians</hi> to <hi>Albany</hi> than they expected, when they wrote to the Commiſſioners for <hi>Indian</hi> Affairs.</p>
            <p>While the Interpreter was at the more diſtant <hi>Indian</hi> Caſtles, Mr. <hi>William Johnſon</hi> was indefatigable among the <hi>Mohawks</hi>; he dreſſed himſelf after the <hi>Indian</hi> Manner, made frequent Dances, according to their Cuſtom when they excite to War, and uſed all the Means he could think of, at a conſiderable Expence, (which his Excellency had promiſed to repay him) in order to engage them heartily in the War againſt <hi>Canada.</hi> Tho' he ſucceeded, beyond what any Man in <hi>Albany</hi> thought could be done, yet ſeveral of the <hi>Sachems</hi> (in the <hi>Conajo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ary,</hi> or upper <hi>Mohawk</hi> Caſtle, chiefly) refuſed to engage in the War; but inſiſted, that as this War was entred into between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> in which they had no Intereſt, they ought to remain Neuter. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> they ſaid, could at any Time make Peace; but if they ſhould enter into the War, <hi>Indians</hi> could not make up the Quarrel among themſelves, otherwiſe than by the Deſtruction of one or the other. The <hi>French</hi> could have no Hopes of engaging the <hi>Six Nations</hi> on their Side againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and therefore wiſely play'd this Game of endeavouring to make them ſtand Neuter, which they could enforce by ſtrong political Arguments, of which the <hi>Indians</hi> were ſenſible enough. <hi>It is your Intereſt,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Emiſſaries ſaid, <hi>not to ſuffer either the</hi> French <hi>or the</hi> Engliſh <hi>to be abſolute Maſters; for in that Caſe you muſt become Slaves to the one or the other.</hi> From this politic View chiefly, the Interpreter met with ſo much Oppoſition every where: Tho' it is not to be doubted, but that at the ſame Time, the <hi>French</hi> had gain'd ſome particular <hi>Sachems</hi> entirely into their Intereſt; however many were prevailed on to come to <hi>Albany,</hi> to hear what the Governor of <hi>New-York</hi> had to ſay to them; tho' ſeveral Sachems ſtaid behind. When they of the more diſtant Nations came along with the Interpreter to the lower <hi>Mohawk</hi> Caſtle, and found that Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> had already engaged many of the young Men there to join the Army againſt <hi>Canada,</hi> the others blamed the <hi>Mohawks</hi>; telling them with ſome Warmth, That they had been very raſh in engaging ſo far. <q>They ought, <hi>the others ſaid,</hi> to have conſidered that they, the <hi>Mohawks,</hi> were the ſmalleſt in Number of any of the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> and ought not to have proceeded to ſo great a Length, without the previous Conſent of the others.</q> To this the <hi>Mohawks</hi> anſwered, <hi>It is true, we are leſs conſiderable as to Number, than any of the other Nations; but our Hearts are truly</hi> Engliſh, <hi>and all of us are Men</hi> 
               <note place="bottom">(a) The <hi>Six Nations</hi> reckon all other Indian Nations, Women, in compariſon to themſelves.</note>; <hi>ſo that, if our Force be put to the Trial, perhaps it will be found greater than you imagine.</hi> Theſe Diſputes, however, continued ſo far, that the <hi>Mohawks</hi> and the other <hi>Five Nations,</hi> could not go in Company to <hi>Albany</hi>; the <hi>Mohawks</hi> marched on one ſide of the River, while the other Nations went on the other Side. [<hi>There are two Roads from the</hi> Mohawks <hi>Caſtle to</hi> Schenectada, <hi>one on each Side of the</hi> Mohawks <hi>River.</hi>]</p>

               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:005791_0007_1026EEAEB0CF6838"/>
When the <hi>Indians</hi> came near the Town of <hi>Albany,</hi> on the 8<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> put himſelf at the Head of the <hi>Mohawks,</hi> dreſſed and painted after the Manner of an <hi>Indian</hi> War Captain; and the <hi>Indians</hi> who followed him, were likewiſe dreſſed and painted, as is uſual with them when they ſet out in War. The <hi>Indians</hi> ſaluted the Governor as they paſſed the Fort, by a running Fir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>; which his Excellency ordered to be anſwered by a Diſcharge of ſome Cannon from the Fort: He afterwards received the Sachems in the Fort Hall, bid them Wellcome, and treated them with a Glaſs of Wine.</p>
            <p>As, by all Accounts, the Diſpoſition of the <hi>Six Nations</hi> ſeemed at this Time leſs in Favour of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Intereſt than was to be wiſhed; his Excellency thought it neceſſary to have frequent Conferences, in private, with the principal Sachems of each <hi>Nation</hi>; ſometimes ſeparately and ſingly, at other Times with ſome of each Nation jointly. There were only two of the <hi>Mohawk</hi> Sachems (beſides <hi>Aaron</hi> before mentioned, who left the Caſtle at this Time) that could not be prevailed on by Mr. <hi>Johnſon,</hi> to declare themſelves for entering into the War againſt <hi>Canada</hi>: They were both of the <hi>Conajo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ary</hi> or Upper-Caſtle, and one of them the Head of the Tribe called the <hi>Tortoiſe</hi>; (which, tho' not ſo numerous as that of the <hi>Bear,</hi> yet is looked on as the Firſt in Rank or Dignity;) and, as he had been with the Governor of <hi>Canada</hi> laſt Spring, it was thought to be of ſome Conſequence to gain him. Mr <hi>Colden,</hi> above Twenty Years ſince, had the Complement of being received into that Caſtle; and, about Seven Years ſince (the laſt Time he had been with the <hi>Mohawks</hi>) had contracted ſome more particular Acquaintance with theſe two Sachems: He invited them to a private Conference, at which the Reverend Mr. <hi>Barclay</hi> aſſiſted as Interpreter; they met him, and brought five more with them: After this Conference theſe Sachems appear'd as hearty as any of the others. He that was Head of the Tribe call'd the <hi>Tortoiſe,</hi> ſaid, <q>His Uncle had been the chief War Captain among the <hi>Mohawks</hi>: That his Uncle had particularly diſtinguiſhed himſelf in their Wars againſt the <hi>French,</hi> and he was reſolved to ſhew himſelf not unworthy of his Anceſtors, nor of his Uncle's Name, which he had obtained after his Death.</q>
            </p>
            <p>After the principal Sachems had, at theſe Conferences, been brought to a good Diſpoſition, his Excellency, adviſed with the Gentlemen of the Council, and the Commiſſioners from the <hi>Maſſachuſets Bay,</hi> on what may be proper to be ſaid to the <hi>Six Nations</hi> in the Publick Speech, which he now propoſed to make to them. Col. <hi>Wendell</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wells</hi> had arrived from <hi>Boſton</hi> about the End of <hi>July,</hi> and ſoon after they came to Town, his Excellency ordered the Gentlemen of the Council to communicate to them all the Information which had been received, with reſpect to the <hi>Indian</hi> Affairs: And they had frequent Conferences together from Time to Time, as Occaſion required: It was likewiſe thought proper to communicate, what his Excellency intended to ſay to ſome of the Sachems of each Nation, who were thought moſt hearty in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Intereſt; who ſaid, that it was well conceiv'd as could have been done, had they themſelves adviſed upon the Subject; only as it had been adviſed to obſerve in the firſt Draught, That ſome of his Majeſty's Subjects had been inſtigated by the <hi>French</hi> to riſe in Rebellion againſt the King; that they had been defeated by one of the King's Sons; that theſe poor People were now utterly ruined, and had nothing left but to bewail their Folly in the Miſery that was brought upon them, by ſuffering themſelves to be deluded by the fair Promiſes of the <hi>French</hi>; they ſaid, that 
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005791_0008_1026EEB1B118D518"/>
they did not underſtand the Affairs on the other Side of the Sea, nor did they trouble their Heads about them; and as they had no Method of retaining what is ſpoke to them but by their Memories, they were afraid that this might perplex their Memories, and make them leſs attentive to what is properly their Buſineſs; and adviſed, that it ſhould be left out; which accordingly was done.</p>
            <p>Another Difficulty remained; the publick Interpreter had been taken dangerouſly ill in his Return to <hi>Albany,</hi> and was at this Time confined to his Bed. Tho' ſeveral were employed, who had Knowledge ſufficient in the Language of the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> to make themſelves be underſtood, and to underſtand what was ſpoke to them; yet none of them were ſo much Maſters of the Language, as to ſpeak with that Propriety and Diſtinctneſs that is expected, and uſual on ſo ſolemn an Occaſion. It was thought therefore proper, to make one of the Sachems underſtand the Speech, by the Aſſiſtance of the common Interpreters, that he might be able to deliver it Paragraph by Paragraph, as it ſhould be ſpoke. At firſt a <hi>Mohawk</hi> Sachem was pitched upon; but the Sachems themſelves told us, That for ſome time paſt a kind of Party-Diviſion among the <hi>Six Nations</hi> had ſubſiſted: That the <hi>Mohawks, Onandagas</hi> and <hi>Senekas,</hi> form'd one Party; and the <hi>Oneydoes, Tuſcaroras</hi> and <hi>Cayugas,</hi> the other: That, as the <hi>Mohawks</hi> might be ſuſpected to be more partial to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> it would be of more Uſe to employ one of the other Party; and an <hi>Oneydo</hi> Sachem was propoſed for that Purpoſe. This Man was eaſily enough made to underſtand the Speech, and he repeated it ſeveral Times over in private, and was inſtructed where to make the proper Stops. After the Speech was delivered, ſome of the Commiſſioners for <hi>Indian</hi> Affairs, and other Perſons preſent at the Delivery, who underſtood both Languages, acknowledged, that this <hi>Indian</hi> had acquitted himſelf of his Truſt faithfully, and had delivered the Senſe of the Speech clearly and diſtinctly.</p>
            <p>While theſe laſt Preparations were making, his Excellency was taken ill of a Fever, which occaſioned ſome further Delay; and as his Excellency did not recover ſo ſoon as was wiſhed, the Sachems were told, that his Excellency being unwilling to detain them witho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Brethren,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I AM glad ſo ſee ſo many of our ancient Friends here, and heartily bid you Wellcome. <stage>[Gave three Strings of Wampum.]</stage>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have call'd you to this Place for two great Ends; in which the Province of the <hi>Maſſachuſets-Bay</hi> have ſent Commiſſioners to concur with me; who are here preſent.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> is, to renew the Covenant Chain with you; and I now by this Belt, in your Father the King of <hi>Great-Britain</hi>'s Name, in Behalf of his Majeſty's Subjects in <hi>North-America,</hi> renew and confirm the Covenant Chain, and all former Treaties and Engagements entered into with you. This Chain has from the Beginning, remained ſo firm and ſtrong, that it has never once broke or ſlipt ſince it was firſt made; and we, on our Parts, ſhall endeavour that it remain ſo, unſhaken, as long as the Sun and Moon ſhall endure. <stage>[Gave a Belt.]</stage>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Brethren,</hi> Laſt Fall I told you, that his Majeſty's Subjects in this Country had, the Summer before, lain ſtill, without attempting any thing againſt the <hi>French</hi> Settlements: But that the <hi>French</hi> had by Surprize, attacked and deſtroyed a ſmall Place near <hi>Cape-Breton,</hi> belonging to us.</p>
                  <p>That they afterwards laid Siege to <hi>Annapolis-Royal,</hi> and were beat off.</p>
                  <p>I likewiſe told you, That the Governor of the <hi>Maſſachuſets-Bay,</hi> in Conjunction with <hi>Connecticut</hi> and <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi>; had, in Revenge to theſe Injuries, ſent an Army againſt <hi>Louiſburg,</hi> on the Iſland of <hi>Cape-Breton</hi>; that the Army was joined by a Number of his Majeſty's Ships of War, under the Command of your Friend Admiral <hi>Warren.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I told you, that the Town of <hi>Louiſburg,</hi> which is the Strongeſt the <hi>French</hi> have in <hi>America,</hi> was reduced by this Force; and that the <hi>French</hi> there, had ſurrendered themſelves and their Country to the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I likewiſe told you, how we in this Part of the Country, had lain ſtill; hoping that the <hi>French</hi> in <hi>Canada,</hi> would either be quiet, or carry on the War in a manly Manner, and after the Manner of Chriſtians. And to induce them thereto, a Meſſage had been ſent from this Place to the Governor of <hi>Canada,</hi> to tell him, That if he ſhould revive the inhuman Cuſtom of murdering private People, by ſculking <hi>Indians,</hi> that the ſeveral Governors of his Majeſty's Colonies, together with you our Brethren of the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> would join and make Repriſals on them in the like Manner; at which time you publickly declared, that if any of his Majeſty's Subjects, in any Part of his Governments, ſhould be killed by any <hi>Indians</hi>; you would immediately join in the War againſt them, and the <hi>French.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And laſt Fall, when I delivered the Hatchet into your Hands, you told me, and confirm'd it with a Belt, That you would ſend ſome of your People (who were then ready) to <hi>Canada,</hi> to demand Satisfaction; and that if Satisfaction was refuſed, you would uſe the Hatchet againſt them, whenever I ſhould order it.</p>
                  <p>And you further promiſed, That if the Enemy ſhould commit any further Hoſtilities, you would then (upon my Commands) immediately make Uſe of the Hatchet.</p>
                  <p>I need not tell you, how far the <hi>French</hi> have been from giving Satisfaction; on the Contrary, you are well acquainted with the cruel and barbarous Murders that have been committed, ſince that Time, by the <hi>French Indians</hi> at <hi>Saraghtoga,</hi> and in the Neighbourhoods of this Place, and on the Frontiers of <hi>New-England</hi>; as you have not hitherto fulfilled your 
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005791_0010_1026EEB61D679E50"/>
Promiſes, I ſuſpect that they did not come from your Hearts: I therefore, by this Belt, demand an immediate Performance of your Promiſes, to ſhew that they come from the Bottom of your Hearts; as all the Promiſes I make come from mine, and ever ſhall. <stage>[Gave a Belt.]</stage>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Brethren,</hi> I now come to the <hi>Second</hi> and principal Deſign of our preſent Meeting, in which I hope and expect to find you hearty, and united in your Councils and Opinions. <stage>[Gave a Belt.]</stage>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King your Father, having been informed of the unmanly Murders committed on the Frontiers of <hi>New-England,</hi> and of this Province; is reſolved to ſubdue the Country of <hi>Canada,</hi> and thereby put an End to all the miſchievous Deſigns of the <hi>French</hi> in theſe Parts. And for this Purpoſe, he has ordered his Governors of <hi>Virginia, Maryland, Pennſylvania,</hi> and <hi>New-Jerſey,</hi> to join their Forces to the Forces of this Province, to attack <hi>Canada</hi> by Land: They are all now upon their March, and you will ſoon ſee them here.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame Time the Forces of the <hi>Maſſachuſets-Bay, Connecticut, Rhode-Iſland,</hi> and <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> are to go in Ships to <hi>Cape-Breton,</hi> and there join with his Majeſty's Ships of War, and a great Army of experienc'd Soldiers from <hi>Great-Britain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many Ships of War are already arrived there, and ſome Thouſand of Soldiers; many more Ships and Soldiers are following; and I expect every Hour to hear of their Arrival; after which the Attack upon <hi>Canada</hi> will be made an all Sides, both by Sea and Land.</p>
                  <p>You may perceive the King has ordered a Strength ſufficient to ſubdue <hi>Canada</hi>; but at the ſame Time, the King your Father expects and orders you his Children, to join with your whole Force in this Enterprize; and thereby gives the <hi>Six Nations</hi> a glorious Opportunity of eſtabliſhing their Fame and Renown over all the <hi>Indian</hi> Nations in <hi>America,</hi> in the Conqueſt of your inveterate Enemies the <hi>French</hi>; who, however they may diſſemble and profeſs Friendſhip, can never forget the Slaughter which your Fathers made of them; and for that Purpoſe, careſs thoſe Nations who have always been your inveterate Enemies, and who deſire nothing ſo much as to ſee the Name of the <hi>Six Nations</hi> become obliterate, and forgot for ever. <stage>[Gave a Belt.]</stage>

                     <hi>Brethren,</hi> The <hi>French,</hi> on all Occaſions, ſhew, that they act againſt your Brethren the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> like Men that know they dare not look them in the Face in Day-Light; and therefore, like Thieves, ſteal upon poor People, who do not expect them in the Night, and conſequently are not prepared for them: Your Brethren in their Revenge, have acted like Men of Courage; they do not attack poor Farmers at their Labour, but boldly attempted the Reduction of <hi>Louiſburg,</hi> the ſtrongeſt Town the <hi>French</hi> had in <hi>America</hi>; in the Fortifying of which they had ſpent above Twenty Years: It was ſurrounded with ſtrong Walls and Forts, in which they had planted their largeſt Cannon in every Place, where they thought the <hi>Engliſh</hi> could come near them; notwithſtanding of all theſe Precautions and Advantages, they were forced to ſubmit to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Valour.</p>
                  <p>You muſt have heard from your Fathers, and I doubt not ſeveral of your old Men ſtill remember, what the <hi>French</hi> did at <hi>Onondaga</hi>; how they ſurprized your Country-Men at <hi>Cadarackui</hi>; how they invaded the <hi>Senekas,</hi> and what Miſchiefs they did to the <hi>Mohawks</hi>; how many of

your Country-Men ſuffered by the Fire at <hi>Montreal.</hi> Before they entered upon theſe cruel and miſchievous Deſigns, they ſent Prieſts among you to delude you, and lull you a Sleep, while they were preparing to knock you in the Head; and I hear they are attempting to do the ſame now. <stage>[Gave a Belt.]</stage>
                  </p>
                  <p>I need not put you in Mind what Revenge your Fathers took for theſe Injuries, when they put all the Iſland of <hi>Montreal,</hi> and a great Part of <hi>Canada,</hi> to Fire and Sword; can you think that the <hi>French</hi> forget this? No, they have the Ax privately in their Hands againſt you, and uſe theſe deceitful Arts, by which only they have been able to gain Advantage over you, that by your truſting to them, they may at ſome time or other, at one Blow, remove from the Face of the Earth, the Remembrance of a People that have ſo often put them to Shame and Flight.</p>
                  <p>If your Fathers could now riſe out of their Graves, how would their Hearts leap with Joy to ſee this Day; when ſo glorious an Opportunity is put into their Hands to revenge all the Injuries their Country has received from the <hi>French,</hi> and be never more expoſed to their Treachery and Deceit. I make no doubt you are the true Sons of ſuch renowned and brave Anceſtors, animated with the ſame Spirit for your Country's Glory, and in Revenge of the Injuries your Fathers received, uncapable of being deluded by the flattering Speeches of them, who always have been, and always muſt be, in their Hearts, your Enemies, and who deſire nothing more, than the Deſtruction of your Nations.</p>
                  <p>I therefore invite you, <hi>Brethren,</hi> by this Belt, to join with us, and to ſhare with us, in the Honour of the Conqueſt of our, and your deceitful Enemies; and that you not only join all the Force of the <hi>Six Nations</hi> with us, but likewiſe invite all the Nations depending on you, to take a Share in this glorious Enterprize: And I will furniſh your fighting Men with Arms, Ammunition, Cloathing, Proviſions, and every Thing neceſſary for the War; and in their Abſence, take Care of their Wives and Children. <stage>[Gave the War Belt.]</stage>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Brethren,</hi> You have ſeen how daring and inſulting on you, as well as us, the <hi>French</hi> Indians have been, in cruelly murdering ſeveral of our People ſince you have come to this Place; and therefore, for the many Reaſons now laid before you, I make no doubt but your Anſwer will clearly manifeſt your Duty to the King your Father, and your Love to your Brethren; and by this Belt I do aſſure you, that our Intent is, to live and die together. <stage>[Gave a Belt of Friendſhip.]</stage>

               <p>At every Stop where a Belt was given, one of the Sachems call'd out <hi>Yo-hay,</hi> to which all the reſt anſwered in a Sound which cannot be expreſſed in our Letters, but ſeem'd to conſiſt of two Words remarkably diſtinguiſhed in the Cadence; it ſeem'd to this purpoſe, <hi>Do you hear?</hi> the Sachem calls: The Anſwer is, We attend and remember, or underſtand; or it is a Kind of Applaudit our Interpreters could not explain. And at the Cloſe of the Speech, one Sachem of each Nation calls out ſeverally the <hi>Yo-hay,</hi> to which the others of the ſame Nation anſwer ſeverally: But when the War-Belt was thrown down, they gave the War-Shout. We expected but Six of theſe Applaudits, according to the Number of the <hi>Six Nations</hi>; but eight were diſtinctly delivered, by which we underſtood ſome other Nations were united with them on this Occaſion.</p>

                  <p>Brethren, <hi>The firſt Time we met together, we only ſaluted each other by ſhaking of Hands; we afterwards made a Covenant Chain of Silver, which we mutualiy have held faſt to this Day; ſhould it now ſlip from either of our Hands, it would prove Deſtruction to both Sides, ſince our Enemies have drawn the Sword.</hi>

               <p>[At the End of the foregoing Paragraph, the Speaker threw down a War-Belt of Wampum on the Ground, it being the <hi>Indian</hi> Cuſtom to deliver War-Belts, or make Declaration of War in this Manner: This he did with a remarkable Shew of Indignation, intending thereby to expreſs their Reſentment againſt the <hi>French</hi> and their Allies, and their Zeal for the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>] <stage>[Gave a Belt.]</stage>

The Thoughts of the Treatment we formerly received from the</hi> French, <hi>thro' the Means of their Prieſts, and which you now ſeaſonably have brought to our Remembrance, makes our Blood to boil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Brother of <hi>New-York; This is the ſecond Time you have put the Hatchet into our Hands, which we accept, and are ready to go upon Service. You may ſee that we have but a Handful of fighting Men here at preſent; however, ſome of them from each Nation ſhall be left behind us to follow your Orders.</hi>

                     <hi>This we aſſure you of from the Truth and Sincerity of our Hearts; and we receive, and ſhall preſerve this large Belt,</hi>

               <p>The Perſon who interpreted, returned the <hi>Yo-hay</hi> at the End of every Paragraph, and having done the ſame at the time they declared War, it occaſion'd Laughter among them; upon which, obſerving his Miſtake, he began the War-Shout, in which all the <hi>Indians</hi> joined.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Meſſeſagues</hi> are a Nation of <hi>Indians</hi> living near the Place called <hi>De Troit,</hi> by the <hi>French,</hi> and ſituate between Lake <hi>Erie</hi> and the <hi>Huron</hi> Lake.</p>
               <p>After the Speaker had finiſhed, his Excellency told them by the Interpreter, that the King their Father had ordered him to make them a Preſent on this Occaſion; and that the Government of <hi>Virginia</hi> had on the ſame Occaſion ſent them a Preſent. The Commiſſioners from <hi>Boſton</hi> at the ſame time told them, that they had a Preſent from their Government; and as they were ſoon to return Home, deſired the <hi>Six Nations</hi> to come to their Lodgings to receive it; on which the <hi>Indians</hi> deſired his Excellency to delay his Preſent to next Day, and they immediately went to receive their Preſents from the Commiſſioners of the <hi>Maſſachuſets-Bay.</hi>

The next Day, the Preſents from the King being expoſed on one Part, and thoſe from <hi>Virginia</hi> ſeparately near them, it was agreed by the People of <hi>Albany,</hi> who had ſeen many publick Preſents given to the <hi>Six Nations</hi> on Treaties with them, that this was the moſt Valuable ever given. His Excellency on the giving the Preſents, ſaid;</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Brethren,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>YOU here ſee a Token of the Regard the King your Father has for you; and there is a Token of the Friendſhip of the Government of <hi>Virginia</hi>: But on this Occaſion I cannot forbear taking Notice to you, that ſome of your People being at <hi>Canada,</hi> when the News of the Reduction of <hi>Cape-Breton</hi> came there, and when the <hi>French</hi> expected that <hi>Quebec</hi> would be immediately attacked in Conſequence of it; ſeveral of them joined with the <hi>French,</hi> and promiſed them Aſſiſtance. This occaſion'd ſome Uneaſineſs to your Brethren, being contrary to the Faith of your Nations, as well as to your Brethren's Expectations; however, you may now, by performing the Promiſes you Yeſterday made in the moſt ſolemn Manner, remove all Suſpicions; and for ever ſecure the Friendſhip of your Brethren, which hitherto has from the Beginning, remain'd unviolated on their Parts. The Goods now before you, are Preſents to the <hi>Six Nations</hi>; and, as we have received the <hi>Meſſeſagues</hi> into the Covenant between you and us, I expect that they ſhall ſhare with you. Beſides theſe general Preſents now made to your Nations, I have prepared proper Cloathing for your War-Captains, and the Warriors who ſhall go under their Command; together with Arms, Ammunition and Proviſions, which ſhall be delivered to the ſeveral Parties at the Time they ſhall go out on Service.</p>
               </q>
               <p>What his Excellency ſaid having been interpreted by a <hi>Mohawk</hi> Sachem, the Sachem added of his own Head, <hi>You now ſee how you are here treated, really like Brethren; the Governor of</hi> Canada <hi>does not treat his</hi> Indians <hi>ſo; they are ſet on like his Dogs, and they run on without Thought or Conſideration: You ſee what a noble Preſent is made to you; if the Governor of</hi> Canada <hi>ſhould ſeize all the Goods in that Country, it would not be in his Power to make ſuch a Preſent.</hi>

                     <hi>You muſt not ſuſpect that it proceeds from any Backwardneſs in us, that a greater Number of our People do not at this Inſtant join with you; the Reaſon is, our Caſtles have but few fighting Men in them, many are now abroad, ſome hunting and trading with far diſtant Nations, and others out fighting againſt our Enemies; all theſe we ſhall recall home as ſoon as poſſible, in order to enter with all our Force, into the War againſt your and our common Enemy.</hi>

                  <p>Brother, <hi>We have no more to ſay at this Time, but only to tell you, we are ſorry that we can ſo little ſhew our Hearts by the Preſents we now offer; our

                  <p>The <hi>Mohawks</hi> added ſeparately: <hi>We have been employed all Summer in your Service as Out-ſcouts, to gain Intelligence, or in ſome Manner or other, and thereby kept from hunting: We have no Furrs to offer you, but we here preſent our Perſons, to ſerve you wherever you ſhall command.</hi>

               <p>That Day was ſpent in dividing the Preſents among themſelves. We were told, That theſe Preſents were divided into eight equal Parts, of which they gave two to the <hi>Meſſeſague</hi> Deputies.</p>
               <p>The next Day the War-Kettle was ſet over the Fire, and towards Evening the <hi>Indians</hi> in his Excellency's Preſence, where many Gentlemen attended him, began the War-Dance, and continued it till late in the Night: They were painted as when they go to War. The Dance is a ſlow and ſolemn Motion, accompanied with a pathetick Song. The <hi>Indians</hi> in their Turns perform this ſingly; but it is not eaſy to deſcribe the Particularities of it.</p>
               <p>His Excellency call'd ſeveral of the chief Sachems who had been uſeful in the Treaty, to him in private, and gave them Preſents ſeverally; neither did he forget the <hi>Meſſeſague</hi> Deputies: He had a particular Conference with one of them in private, the other was ſick of the Small-Pox.

This Misfortune was increaſed by the Death of the other <hi>Meſſeſague</hi> Deputy likewiſe, who was taken ill in his Way home, and died. The <hi>Six Nations</hi> took Care of their Wives and Children, who had come with them; and it was not doubted but that they, and all the Preſents given them, would be ſafely conveyed to their own Homes.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Children,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I AM glad to meet you at this Time, as do likewiſe the Commiſſioners from the <hi>Maſſachuſets-Bay,</hi> who are now come hither to concur with me upon the preſent Occaſion; and I take this Opportunity to renew the ancient Covenant Chain with you, in Behalf of this and all his Majeſty's Governments in <hi>America,</hi> which you know has always been kept bright and clean, without any of the leaſt Stain or Ruſt; and which by this Belt I ſtrengthen. <stage>[Gave a Belt.]</stage>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Children,</hi> My meeting you here, beſides renewing the Covenant Chain, is with Intention that you ſhould join your Force with ours, by taking up the Hatchet againſt our and your common Enemies the <hi>French,</hi> and their <hi>Indians</hi>; who have in a very unmanly Manner, by ſculking Parties, murder'd, in cold Blood, many of your Brethren in this and the Province of the <hi>Maſſachuſets-Bay.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Behaviour lays us under a Neceſſity of mking Repriſals on them in like Manner, in which I make no doubt of your Aſſiſtance; and we are reſolved to take a thorough Revenge of our and your perpetual Enemies, by reducing the Country of <hi>Canada,</hi> that it may not be in the Power of theſe perfidious, deceitful and cruel People, to do you or us any Injury for the future: For which Purpoſe all the neighbouring Colonies, together with many Ships of War and Soldiers from <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> are reſolved to unite their Force, and to attack <hi>Canada</hi> in all Parts, both by Sea and Land; and I make no doubt, you will on this Occaſion ſhew your ſelves dutiful Children, in joining heartily with us and the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> in this glorious Enterprize; by which you will not only gain Honour and Renown, but alſo Safety and Proſperity to your Selves, your Wives, and Children forever afterwards: And for which End I will furniſh your fighting Men with Arms, Ammunition, Cloathing, Proviſions, and every Thing neceſſary for the War. <stage>[Gave a War-Belt.]</stage>
                  </p>
               </q>
               <p>On the 26<hi>th</hi> they gave their Anſwer, which was interpreted in the following Words; (The ſame Perſons being Preſent that were when the Governor's Speech was delivered to them.)</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Father,</p>
                  <p>WE are glad to ſee you; and we are come to renew the Covenant Chain, and make it faſt and bright as ever, and free from Ruſt; and as a Token thereof we given you this Belt. <stage>[Gave a Belt.]</stage>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Father,</hi> You have told us what Miſchief the <hi>French</hi> have done, and what Murders upon the Chriſtians they have committed; therefore we declare from 
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:005791_0017_1026EEC8EDD02258"/>
our Hearts, and not from our Lips only, that as you have ordered us to ſhed the Enemies Blood in Return for what they have done, we are reſolved to live and die with you in the Common Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>When you Chriſtians are at War, you make Peace with one another; but it is not ſo with us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore we depend upon you to take Care of us; in Confidence of which, we now take up the Hatchet, and will make Uſe of it againſt the <hi>French,</hi> and their <hi>Indians.</hi> 
                     <stage>[Gave a Belt with a Hatchet.]</stage>
                  </p>
               </q>
               <p>After their Anſwer they began the War-Dance, and his Excellency ordered a conſiderable Preſent in Goods to be publickly given them. None of theſe are ſuſpected to be under <hi>French</hi> Influence.</p>
               <p>As there was no Advice of the Arrival of the Fleet, and no Plan of Operations agreed on in Caſe the Fleet did not arrive, the Supporting of about Seven Hundred <hi>Indians</hi> was a great Expence to his Excellency, for which he had no Allowance from the Province of <hi>New-York</hi>; or for any other Charge attending this Treaty: And as many of the <hi>Indians,</hi> (above Twenty) had got the Small-Pox, it being impracticable to prevent their going into Town, or converſing with the Town's People, and the <hi>Indians</hi> becoming uneaſy by reaſon of the Sickneſs of many, and Death of ſome; his Excellency thought it moſt prudent to diſmiſs them as ſoon as poſſible from this Place, and to give Orders to Mr. <hi>Johnſon,</hi> to ſend out ſeveral Parties from <hi>Schenectade,</hi> or his own Settlement near the lower <hi>Mohawk</hi> Caſtle, to haraſs the <hi>French</hi> Settlements in <hi>Canada</hi>; and for that Purpoſe delivered to him Cloathing, Arms and Ammunition, to be given to the fighting Men, as his Excellency had promiſed them whenever they entered on Service, and impowered him to furniſh them with Proviſions and whatever Neceſſaries they ſhould want.</p>
               <p>Before they went, his Excellency ſent to them, to deſire them to leave their Sick, with a Promiſe to take all Care poſſible of them; and that he would order Phyſicians to attend them. They were very ſenſible of this Kindneſs, and acknowledged it; but not above two or three could be prevailed to ſtay, who were ſo ill that they could not be removed: All poſſible Care was taken of the other Sick, in the Waggons which carried them to <hi>Schenectade.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the 26<hi>th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> the Capts. <hi>Staats</hi> and <hi>Vromen</hi> brought the <hi>Indians</hi> living on the Branches of the <hi>Suſquehannah</hi> River; they came in the <hi>Indian</hi> Order, marching in a ſingle Line one after the other, and as they paſſed the Fort, ſaluted by a running Fire along the Line; which Salute the Governor ordered to be returned by a Diſcharge of ſome Cannon from the Fort.</p>
               <p>On Monday the 8<hi>th</hi> of the ſame Month his Excellency ſpoke to them, telling them the Subſtance of what he had ordered to be ſaid to the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> and their Anſwer; and as this has been ſet forth at Length before, it is needleſs to repeat what was then ſaid. The Reaſon of his Excellency's ſpeaking to them in this Manner, was, becauſe theſe Nations living on the <hi>Suſquehannah</hi> River and its Branches, are known to be Dependents on the <hi>Six Nations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next Day they gave their Anſwer; the Gentlemen of the Council; the Commiſſioners for <hi>Indian</hi> Affairs; the Corporation of <hi>Albany</hi>; the Officers of the four Independent Companies; and ſeveral Officers of the new Levies, and other Gentlemen being preſent, as they were when his Excellency ſpoke to the <hi>Indians</hi>: Their Anſwer was publickly interpreted as follows;</p>

                  <p>Brother of <hi>New-York,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>WE live at <hi>Ohguago</hi>; what News you ſend to the <hi>Six Nations</hi> is not truely reported to us, nor what the Governor of <hi>Canada</hi> ſends to them; we have not been properly taken Notice of, nor timely acquainted with your Deſign to treat with the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> till near the Time that your Interview with them was over, otherwiſe we ſhould have readily come along with them, to hear what our Brother had to propoſe to us; and if we had received earlier Notice, a much larger Number of our fighting Men would have come along with us: Our Settlements are ſcattering, and ſome of them at a great Diſtance from others, and many of our Men are from Home a hunting; we have, however ſent the Belt of Invitation forward to thoſe who live at a greater Diſtance, that they may be able at the Time appointed to come and join us in the War, as by your Belt we were deſired.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Brother,</hi> You Yeſterday inform'd us of what you had ſaid to the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> and their Anſwer; we are grieved that the <hi>Six Nations</hi> have not already made uſe of the Hatchet, but have hitherto kept it by them, and have not ſent out their young Men to revenge the Murders which have been committed by the Enemy.</p>
                  <p>We are reſolved to make uſe of the Hatchet againſt the French, to revenge the Injuries done to you and your People, our Brethren.</p>
                  <p>We have received at Times very different Kind of News from the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> ſometimes it ſeem'd as if the <hi>French</hi> would be Maſters; but it cannot be ſo, they are a deceitful People, and cannot be truſted; they make fair Promiſes, and have no Intention to perform them; they flatter themſelves with Hopes to be Maſters, but they ſhall be diſappointed; for we ſhall keep the Hatchet firmly in our Hands, and are reſolved to make Uſe of it.</p>
                  <p>We know ſeveral Roads that lead to <hi>Canada</hi>; we want to ſee the Hatchet that we may take it up.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Upon which his Excellency threw down a Hanger; which the Speaker took up and began the War-Dance, and ſeveral others danced the ſame after him.</p>
               <p>After which they deſired his Excellency to take Care of them, as he had promiſed.</p>
               <p>His Excellency returned them Thanks for their ſo readily taking up the Hatchet; he ſaid, that he would preſently ſet the War-Kettle over the Fire, and provide them with every Thing neceſſary for the War. His Excellency gave them a handſome Preſent in Publick for their Nations in general, and private Preſents to their principal Sachems; one of which promiſed, that after his return Home, he would go round all the <hi>Indian</hi> Settlements, to invite them into the War againſt the <hi>French,</hi> and their <hi>Indians</hi>; and that he did not doubt to be able to bring Six Hundred Men from the <hi>Indian</hi> Settlements on the <hi>Suſquehannah</hi> River and its Branches, to march at any Time and to any Place his Excellency ſhall appoint, in order to join the Forces intended againſt <hi>Canada</hi>; in the mean Time they would cauſe a Party of their Men to go out with his Men to ſcour the Woods, and clear them of the <hi>French</hi> ſculking <hi>Indians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About this Time a Serjeant of Capt. <hi>Living ſton's</hi> Company was ſurprized and kill'd by a ſculking Party of <hi>French</hi> Indians: In a few Minutes after the Account of this came to his Excellency, who happened to be Dining at that Time in Capt. <hi>Wrexall</hi>'s Tent, fourteen of the <hi>Suſquehannah</hi> Indians were obſerv'd running paſt the Tent, in order to croſs the River, and meet the <hi>French</hi> Indians; which his Excellency obſerving, and being apprehenſive that they might meet with ſome of the Parties of the new Levies that were 
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:005791_0019_1026EED0769FC7A8"/>
gone out for the ſame Purpoſe, and that they might be in Danger of being attacked through Miſtake; he aſk'd if any of the Guard which then attended, would voluntarily go along with the <hi>Indians</hi>? Two Men offered themſelves, who went with one who underſtood the <hi>Indian</hi> Language, in order to prevent Miſtakes. Happy it was that this Precaution was taken; for Capt. <hi>Fanning</hi> with a great Part of his Company, having gone out with the ſame Intention of intercepting the <hi>French</hi> Indians, he diſcovered this Party of our <hi>Indians,</hi> and taking them to be <hi>French</hi> Indians, he kept his Men under the Cover of ſome Buſhes, with their Arms ready to fire, expecting the nearer Approach of the <hi>Indians</hi>; when one of the Chriſtians, who were with them, obſerving Capt. <hi>Fanning</hi>'s Men, call'd out, and came up to Capt. <hi>Fanning</hi> when his Men were ready to fire. None of the Parties that went out were able to diſcover any of the Enemy.</p>
               <p>His Excellency afterwards ſent out ſixteen of theſe <hi>Indians,</hi> and cloathed them for that Purpoſe, together with about ſixty Men detached from the Companies levied in the County of <hi>Albany,</hi> in order to ſcour the Woods, and to advance as far as the Lakes to gain Intelligence, by taking Priſoners or otherwiſe. While this Party was out, ſome of the <hi>Indians</hi> ſell ſick, and the others being apprehenſive of the ſame Misfortune, they return'd, after having been but a few Days in the Woods. His Excellency then perceiving the Uneaſineſs the <hi>Indians</hi> were under from the Apprehenſions of Sickneſs, found it neceſſary to diſmiſs them all, on their Promiſe to return, whenever his Excellency ſhall order, with all the Force they ſhall be able to collect; and which, they ſaid, as before obſerved, might amount to Six Hundred Men. The Number of <hi>Indians</hi> that came at this Time from the <hi>Suſquehannah</hi> River, confided only of about Sixty fighting Men, beſides old Men, Women and Children: More had come near to <hi>Albany,</hi> but having there heard of the Small-Pox and Sickneſs that was at <hi>Albany,</hi> and that many of the <hi>Six Nations</hi> had catched the Infection, and ſeveral of them dead, they returned back.</p>
               <p>After the <hi>Six Nations</hi> left <hi>Albany,</hi> many of them were taken ſick on their Way home, before they reached the <hi>Mohawk</hi> Caſtles, and a conſiderable Number of the briſkeſt young Men of the <hi>Mohawks,</hi> died. This retarded the Execution of the Order given to Mr. <hi>Johnſon,</hi> to ſend out Parties to haraſs the <hi>French</hi> Settlements in <hi>Canada,</hi> tho' he uſed all the Means in his Power to effect it. While he was preſſing them to this Purpoſe, one of the Sachems who had promiſed to head a Party from the <hi>Canajohary</hi> Caſtle, ſaid, <hi>You ſeem to think that we are Brutes, that we have no Senſe of the Loſs of our deareſt Relations, and ſome of them the braveſt Men we had in our Nation: You muſt allow us Time to bewail our Misfortune.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About ten Days before his Excellency left <hi>Albany,</hi> a Party of upwards of Seventy Men, conſiſting of ſome of each Nation, went againſt <hi>Canada</hi>: Some Chriſtians were of the Party to aſſiſt and direct, and to be Witneſſeſs of the Behaviour of the <hi>Indians.</hi> They were to avoid all the Lakes, and the uſual Roads and Paſſes to <hi>Canada,</hi> and were to go through the Woods over Mountains, that are ſeldom paſſed, to prevent the Enemies diſcovering of them: But after theſe had been out, Capt. <hi>Butler</hi>'s Son, to whom the chief Direction of this Party was committed, was taken ill of the Small-Pox, and five of the <hi>Indians</hi> were obliged to return to carry him Home. Another ſmall Party was ſent out to take Priſoners and gain Intelligence at <hi>Crown-Point.</hi> At the Writing of this it is not known what Succeſs they have had.</p>
               <p>

When the <hi>Six Nations</hi> had come as far as the Lower <hi>Mohawk</hi> Caſtle, in their return Home, they were met by about ſix Men of their own Nations, who delivered a Meſſage from <hi>Canada,</hi> which had been brought by the <hi>Indian</hi> who was taken by the <hi>French</hi> at <hi>Crown Point</hi> and carried to <hi>Canada.</hi> The Meſſage was interpreted in the following Words: <q>The Governor of <hi>Canada</hi> had called the <hi>Cahnuaga</hi> Indians to him, and then complain'd to them, that ſome of the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> his Children, had kill'd ſome of his People: You all know, <hi>be ſaid,</hi> that I am not haſty or paſſionate, but will rather bear a great Deal than ſhew Reſentment; wherefore I am reſolved to paſs this over; but in the mean Time I muſt deſire you to go among the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> to find out the Reaſon of this Proceeding, and to tell them, that if any Thing like it happen again, I will make them ſmart: You may, nevertheleſs, aſſure my Children

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Cahnuagas</hi> gave the following Anſwer to the Governor of <hi>Canada:</hi> Father, <hi>You are in the Wrong, to deſire us to go among the</hi> Six Nations <hi>for Intelligence, or with Menaces; for ſuch will only ſtir them up, and bring them and all their Allies (who are very numerous) upon you, to deſtroy you at once.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Brethren,</hi> The Governor our Father, being Informed, that your Governor is raiſing Men to come againſt <hi>Canada,</hi> deſires us to tell you, that he has <hi>One Thouſand eight hundred</hi> Men at <hi>Crown Point,</hi> ready to give them Battle; in which Number the Men of eight Caſtles of the <hi>Utawawas</hi> are included.</p>

               </q>
               <p>A <hi>Cahnuaga</hi> Indian was ſent along with the Priſoner that was reſtored; but when he came near the Settlements of the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> his Heart fail'd him, and be ſent the Priſoner forward by himſelf with the Meſſage.</p>

The Readineſs with which the <hi>Six Nations</hi> communicated this Meſſage, and the Slight they in all Appearance put upon it, is ſome Proof of their Sincerity in the Promiſes they made to his Excellency; neither from any Thing which has happened can it be ſhewn; that they were not ſincere. On the Contrary, it appears by Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi>'s Letter to his Excellency, of the 21ſt of <hi>October,</hi> That ſeveral Parties are now out againſt the <hi>French</hi>; and that Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> having received Orders from Col. <hi>Roberts,</hi> to ſend as many <hi>Indians</hi> as poſſible to join the Army; all the <hi>Mohawks,</hi> even their old Men, were ſitted out and ready; and having ſent to the Upper Caſtles at the ſame Time, they appeared ſo hearty, that there would not have remained above three old Men in any of the next Caſtles: And that Col. <hi>Roberts</hi> afterwards contradicting theſe Orders, they had appeared very uneaſy on their being ſtopt. It was not expected, that they would enter into the Wat without us, or by themſelves, neither are they a People of ſo little Thought as to give any Reaſon to expect it from them.</p>
               <p>When the Companies rais'd in <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> arriv'd at <hi>Albany,</hi> his Excellency was informed by their Captains, that Mr. <hi>Thomas,</hi> Governor of that Province, had ſent <hi>Conrad Weiſer,</hi> their publick Interpreter, among the <hi>Suſquehannah</hi> Indians; and that they expected his Arrival at this Place in a little Time, with, at leaſt, three hundred <hi>Indians.</hi> The Treaties with the <hi>Indians,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Thomas</hi> has publiſhed, gave great Hopes of the Succeſs that Interpreter would have; and thereby increaſed the Diſappointment, when Mr. <hi>Weiſer</hi> arrived a few Days before his Excellency left <hi>Albany,</hi> and did not bring one <hi>Indian</hi> with him.</p>
               <p>His Excellency Governor <hi>Clinton,</hi> had perhaps more Difficulties to ſtruggle with on this Occaſion, than any Governor of <hi>New-York</hi> had at any Time The <hi>Six Nations</hi> had on ſeveral Occaſions given Grounds of Miſtruſt; the Governor of <hi>Canada</hi> was attempting all the Means in his Power to divert their Affections from us; the People of the County of <hi>Albany</hi> had for ſome time paſt, entertain'd a Diſſatisfaction in the Conduct of the Commiſſioners for <hi>Indian</hi> Affairs; the Commiſſioners themſelves were divided in their Sentiments, and ſeveral of them refuſed to attend their Meetings; and they confeſes'd to his Excellency, that they had loſt all Influence on the <hi>Indians</hi>; Mr. <hi>Gooch</hi> having declined the Command of the Forces at <hi>Albany,</hi> his Excellency was forced likewiſe to undertake a new and great Care, which he in no Manner expected when he left the City of <hi>New-York,</hi> and which from many Incidents, was attended with many Difficulties. If theſe Things be duly conſidered, and the Dangers his Perſon was in from the Infection of two different Diſeaſes, which at that Time raged in the City of <hi>Albany,</hi> of which great Numbers died during his Reſidence there of near three Months; none can doubt of his hearty Zeal for the Succeſs of an Affair, in which the Safety and Proſperity of all the Colonies in North <hi>America,</hi> were immediately concerned.</p>
               <p>But as every one may not be ſufficiently apprized of what Conſequence the <hi>Six Nations</hi> being hearty, is of to the Intereſt of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> it may be proper to obſerve, That tho'a Number of <hi>Indians</hi> to march with the Army, which was intended to attack <hi>Canada,</hi> would be of great Uſe in diſcovering and defeating the Ambuſhes of the Enemy's <hi>Indians,</hi> while they were every Day to be guarded againſt by the Forces which were to march by Land, and would by their Incurſions into the Enemy's Country, terribly haraſs them, and keep them from joining their Forces into any great Body to oppoſe the Deſign; theſe are not the moſt conſiderable Advantages may be gain'd from the Affection

of the <hi>Six Nations</hi> at this Time; or any Time of War; for if the inland Extent of the Colonies from <hi>Nova Scotia</hi> to <hi>Georgia</hi> be conſidered, and at the ſame Time the numerous <hi>Indian</hi> Nations on the Continent of <hi>America,</hi> who may by the Artifices of the <hi>French</hi> be induced to make Incurſions every where; and the cruel Methods by which the <hi>Indians</hi> make Incurſions in ſmall Parties from the vaſt Foreſt which every where covers the Continent, and which in many Places is impenetrable; it muſt evidently appear, that tho' the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colonies be of much ſuperior Force to the <hi>French</hi> in Numbers of Men, yet their Number would not be ſufficient to protect their Frontiers from the Incurſions of the <hi>Indians</hi> in every Place: And, that while their Forces muſt in this Caſe be divided and ſcattered all over their Frontiers, it may be in the Power of the <hi>French</hi> in <hi>Canada,</hi> to invade with Succeſs any Part of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colonies. On the other Hand, if a proper Attempt were to be made by the northern Colonies alone, without the Aſſiſtance of their Mother Country; but with the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Indians,</hi> it would in all Appearance be ſufficient to reduce <hi>Canada</hi>; for if the <hi>Indian</hi> Nations can be perſwaded to join heartily, (as from what is above related ſeems probable they may) it will be impoſſible for the Inhabitants of <hi>Canada</hi> to defend themſelves from the Incurſions of theſe numerous <hi>Indian</hi> Nations, and from a Body of regular Troops at the ſame Time. As the <hi>French</hi> are very ſenſible of theſe Advantages to be gain'd from the Friendſhip of the <hi>Indian</hi> Nations, they neglect no Means in their Power to procure them: And it is to be hoped, that the nothern Colonies will be no lets aſſidious in a Matter on which their Well-being at leaſt depends.</p>
               <p>Some People wiſh, that the <hi>Indians</hi> may remain Neuter, and think it adviſeable to purſue Meaſures for that Purpoſe, by which many horrid Barbarities would be prevented. No doubt this is to be wiſhed; but can the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colonies by any Means be aſſured, that the <hi>French</hi> will be ſincere in preſerving ſuch a Neutrality? And if they be not ſincere, we ſhall more certainly expoſe ourſelves to all theſe Calamities, than we are now by <hi>Indians</hi> being engaged on both Sides. The <hi>Six Nations</hi> are by their natural Inclinations diſpoſed to War-like Enterprizes: They never have been at Peace with all their Neighbours ſince they were known to Chriſtians. The Reputation they have gain'd among all the <hi>Indian</hi> Nations in North <hi>America,</hi> gives them an Influence in the Councils of every Nation. It may then be eaſy for the <hi>French</hi> to turn this Diſpoſition to War in the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> againſt us, and by their Influence draw all the <hi>Indian</hi> Nations in North <hi>America</hi> upon us. The Genius of the <hi>Six Nations</hi> will not ſuffer them to remain inactive while their Neighbours are at War.</p>
               <p>In the laſt Place, it may not be improper to obſerve at this Time, that tho' the Colonies to the Southward (and the Inhabitants of the Parts of the northern Colonies, which are leſs expoſed to the Incurſions of <hi>Indians</hi>) think themſelves little concern'd in Intereſt, or in the Conſequences of the preſent War; yet if they would conſider that the northern Colonies are really their Frontier, and that they defend the others from all the Calamities of a moſt barbarous War; the ſouthern Colonies muſt think that any Contribution of Men and Money, which is expected from them, is an eaſy Purchaſe of the Freedom from ſuch Calamities to which their Brethren are ſubjected; and that while they can follow their Occupations at Eaſe, they are much better enabled to ſupport the Expence of a War than the northern Colonies are, where the Inhabitants are every Day in Danger of their Lives from a cruel Enemy, while at their daily and innocent Labours. If the ſouthern Colonies neglect to keep the War at a Diſtance from them, they may at an improper Time, become ſenſible of the Evils their Brethren ſuffer, and of their own Folly at the ſame Time.</p>
