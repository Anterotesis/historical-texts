            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>AS the preſent conteſt between Britain and America muſt ſooner or later come to period, the future harmony of the preſent belligerant powers, the general good of both Europe and America, and perpetuating peace on each ſide of the Atlantic, will in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity greatly depend on the footing on which mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters may be put at the treaty of peace; and yet among the various topics repeatedly diſcuſſed in the public papers, little or nothing has been ſaid on this head. It certainly cannot be improper to bring the ſubject into view, and excite the public
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:016825_0004_0F9E828C993575F0"/>
attention, to a matter of ſo great moment, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving in it, not only every individual of the preſent generation, but the happineſs of ages yet unborn. For this purpoſe, the following thoughts are ſubmitted to public conſideration.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Reſpecting territory or dominion. The God of nature, by interpoſing the vaſt Atlantic between Europe and America, ſeems evidently to have pointed out the true natural connection of the one with the other, to be by trade and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce; and to have forbidden both to exerciſe rule or authority, except on their own ſide of the ocean. As long, indeed, as any European pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er holding poſſeſſions in America, treats the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants ſo that they find their intereſt and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs beſt ſecured and promoted by ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection, ſo long may that connection be expected to continue, and no longer. Whenever this ceaſes to be the caſe, that people, if able, will certainly revolt, and ſet up for themſelves; or, if not able, will watch for and embrace the firſt favourable opportunity of extricating themſelves from the yoke. This is a principle in nature; and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the reverſe is equally abſurd as to expect rivers to turn backward, or the ebbing and flowing of the ſea to ceaſe. European ſovereignty, therefore, as long as it exiſts in America, muſt ever be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by gentle meaſures, engaging the affections of the people, and convincing them of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in it. The moment the iron ſceptre is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted in the place of the olive wand, that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the connection begins to diſſolve; and by continuing to enforce their authority by violence,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:016825_0005_0F9E828D58080210"/>
it is eternally broken. Thus it has been between Britain and the American ſtates; inſomuch that were both parties deſirous to return to their former connections, it would be in the nature of things impoſſible for human wiſdom to deviſe a plan, which the mutual jealouſies and diſtruſt unavoidable in ſuch a caſe, would not utterly and inevitably defeat. Were Britain, therefore, to be influenced ſolely by a regard to her intereſt, without the leaſt attention to any other motive, ſhe would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſettle matters on that plan which is beſt calculated to reſtore friendſhip, and lay a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for obtaining advantage by an amicable commercial intercourſe; which from the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things cannot be expected in any other channel. But to obtain this, and to ſettle mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters on a ſolid baſis, ſhe muſt not only allow the independence of the thirteen ſtates, but muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh all claims of dominion over the part ſhe yet holds on the continent, eſpecially her northern poſſeſſions, and allow them to legiſlate for, and govern, themſelves in the manner they may think beſt, either in union with the other ſtates, or ſeparate from them. And whatever Britain or others may think of it, and whatever means may be uſed to prevent it, to this ſituation matters muſt and will come, by the natural and neceſſary courſe of human affairs, before they reſt in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap> ſtate. The reaſons are obvious; her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſhing her claims of dominion over the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions ſhe holds, would appear to the people as an act of generoſity, and tend to unite them to her commercial intereſt, more than any reſtraint or
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:016825_0006_0F9E82901AADAA88"/>
force could poſſibly do, and would at the ſame time convince the ſtates, that ſhe had laid aſide all hoſtile deſigns againſt America: and thus remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all ground of jealouſy and apprehenſion of danger, would open a door to mutual friendly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe; and accompliſh by the ſubtilty of the fox, what ſhe cannot obtain by the force of the lion. Whereas if ſhe reſolve to retain them, her fear of loſing them, by revolt or otherwiſe, will neceſſarily oblige her to a great expence in forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, keeping up troops, &amp;c. &amp;c. which will probably overbalance all the advantage derived from claiming them as hers; beyond what ſhe might have by a free trade, on the foot of their being their own maſters. Her ſtrengthening theſe places will alſo naturally alarm the ſtates, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate their jealouſy of her having ſtill a deſign to attack them in ſome quarter, and prevent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of friendſhip. It may alſo diſquiet the minds of the people thus retained, as though kept like vaſſals, when they ſee the ſtates trade freely to all parts of the world, and themſelves confined to Britain; and in proceſs of time produce a revolt; and the fortifications Britain had made be turned againſt herſelf: or ſhould a war again break out between her and the other maritime powers, ſome of them might ſeize perhaps thoſe retained poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, and deprive her intirely of trade to them afterwards; and beſides, the conſequence of her retaining theſe poſſeſſions will be, either that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences and diſturbances will riſe between thoſe Britiſh ſubjects, and the ſubjects of the ſtates neighbouring ſo near together, as in the caſe from
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:016825_0007_0F9E829118135868"/>
which my motto is taken; or they will attempt to ſet up for themſelves and become inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant; in either of which caſes, a war will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably enſue, and ſpread the flame through Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope as well as America; which ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be guarded againſt, in the moſt effectual manner, by every power that would wiſh the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of peace. France wiſely foreſaw the danger, that might ariſe from ſuch a vicinity of different ſubjects; and therefore effectually to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent future differences, interwove in the ground work of the alliance with the ſtates, a quit-claim to act her former poſſeſſions in America; and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the danger of differences ariſing between Britain and the ſtates is far greater, than could in that caſe have been ſuppoſed. In ſhort, if Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain retains any part of her American poſſeſſions, eſpecially to the northward, a peace, whenever made, will not be ſheathing the ſword, but lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it by for a ſeaſon, to be preſently employed again, in the horrid ſcenes of bloodſhed, maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre and war. The caſe with reſpect to Spain to the ſouthward is very different; there ſubſiſts no animoſity or jealouſy; and both they and the ſtates, have ſuch a vaſt ſcope of yet unexplored country lying behind them, that there is not the leaſt probability of any differences ariſing between them, from vicinity.</p>

            <p>THE next object of attention is the fiſheries by Nova Scotia, the iſlands adjacent, New-foundland, &amp;c. &amp;c. and here it is to be obſerved, that as honeſty is the beſt policy, and individuals ever find their true intereſt in uprightneſs, and doing to others as they would wiſh to be done to themſelves; it is ſo alſo with nations, and their true political intereſt conſiſts not in making power, but juſtice and right, the rule of their conduct. The path of policy, when viewed in this point of light, and indeed the only true one, is plain and eaſy, entirely free from thoſe crooked turnings and windings, as falſly as frequently termed ſtate policy, and which never fails, ſooner or later, to lead to deſtruction, thoſe that walk in them.</p>
            <p>On this ſure and ſolid principle alone, I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proceed to obſerve, that the God of Nature has wiſely ballanced to all parts of the habitable earth, their advantages and diſadvantages; and has ſo ordered matters, that the wants of one nation are ſupplied by the redundance of thoſe articles in another, and ſo reſpectively throughout the whole: For this end, no doubt, to maintain a
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:016825_0009_0F9E82929C2D5D18"/>
mutual intercourſe and exchange of benefits, among the various parts of the great family of mankind; and thus to form a univerſal cement, by each contributing to the ſupply of others, as the members of the body, to the general good of the whole.—What therefore Nova Scotia, Iſlands, Newfoundland and States adjacent, &amp;c. might want in other reſpects, it has pleaſed the great Creator to make up to them in numerous ſhoals of fiſh along their coaſt; as evidently deſigned in the firſt inſtance for their benefit, as the pearl fiſhery in the gulf of Perſia is for that people, or the ſalt on the coaſts of Portugal and the Iſlands, for the advantage of the inhabitants, or the quails in the wilderneſs for the children of Iſrael; and in the ſecond, to furniſh them with a ſtaple for trade and intercourſe with their brethren of mankind; that they might mutually benefit, and be benefited by one another: and accordingly all nations have ever agreed, that the ſea, lying along the coaſt of a country, with the particular advantages derived from it, as really as the land on which they dwell, belongs to the inhabitants.</p>
            <p>On this principle, each European power claims their adjoining ſea, and would eſteem it an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſion and inſult, ſhould any others pretend to claim an equal right. And on this univerſally confeſſed principle, when Queen Elizabeth, A. D. 1578, made a grant to Sir Humphry Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, confirming to him, his heirs and aſſigns for ever, all the lands he might diſcover in North America, as far northerly as ſixty-eight degrees of north latitude, not already occupied or claimed by any Chriſtian power; the adjoining ſeas were

equally granted and confirmed to him as the land; and by virtue of this grant, Newfoundland was ſettled, and in King James's firſt and ſecond charters for Virginia, A. D. 1606 and 1600, comprehending the whole country between the latitudes thirty-four and forty-five, from ſea to ſea, the adjoinining ſeas, with the iſlands, fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, &amp;c. are equally and as expreſsly granted as the land: and in his third charter, A. D. 1611, this ſea extent is particularly mentioned, to the diſtance of a thouſand miles.</p>
            <p>The right of European powers, to grant lands they never owned, is not now the queſtion, but it ſerves to ſhew the ſenſe of nations on this head; and as a quit claim to America, againſt any European pretenſions to fiſheries on their coaſts; as whatever claim there was by any European power, Britain had it, and whatever right ſhe had or claimed, ſhe ſolemnly tranſferred and confirmed to the inhabitants of the country. From all which it evidently appears, that the fiſheries on the coaſts of Nova Scotia, and iſlands belonging thereto, with Newfoundland, &amp;c. &amp;c. properly belong to the people inhabiting the adjacent land, (otherwiſe the great Creator could have eaſily ordered the American ſinny tribes to the European ſhoars) and that they cannot in juſtice be deprived thereof, by the intervention of others, any more than of the land on which they are ſettled.</p>
            <p>If, therefore, matters are allowed to reſt on this univerſally acknowledged and confirmed principle, inhabitants coming from whatever part
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:016825_0011_0F9E82941CDF53B0"/>
they may, and ſettling in the country, will find employment and ſupport by the fiſheries, and commerce and a free trade will afford an ample ſupply to others; and things being thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted in a natural eaſy channel, all future occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of war or bloodſhed from this quarter will be effectually prevented, and a fair and pleaſing proſpect opened of permanent peace.—Whereas, ſhould any European power engroſs the fiſhery, beſides the manifeſt violation of juſtice towards the inhabitants of the adjacent lands or ſtates, that power would poſſeſs ſuch undue advantages over others, not only in the article of fiſhing, but in a nurſery for ſeamen, to encreaſe their marine and man their fleets, as to render the ſafety of their neighbours exceedingly precarious, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually endanger the peace of both Europe and America. Suppoſe any one European power to have fifty or ſixty thouſand men employed in the fiſhery, as might very readily be, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſoon would be, if engroſſed by any one, how eaſy would it be, for ſuch power to fit out and man a fleet, that would overturn the liberty of both Europe and America, and give law to all the nations around? and ſtill more ſo, if that nation ſhould poſſeſs a great extent of adjacent country, to furniſh materials for ſhip building, &amp;c. whilſt on the other hand, if the fiſhery be carried on by the inhabitants of the adjacent country, to whom it properly belongs, no ſuch danger can be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, as the idea of invading Europe, or attempting to acquire any poſſeſſions there, would be too abſurd and chimerical, ever to enter the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:016825_0012_0F9E8294D6FAB0C0"/>
minds of a people, at ſo great a diſtance. This is a matter ſo deeply intereſting to European powers as well as America, that a regard to their own advantages and ſafety loudly calls for their moſt ſerious attention, and utmoſt exertions to prevent it.—And to throw the fiſheries open to all, would be in effect confirming them to the few, who are already in poſſeſſion; for their knowlege of the buſineſs, and the caſe with which they could interrupt their neighbours, by only altering the ſize of their fiſhing veſſels, and thereby diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging adventurers, would, beſides the flagrant injuſtice mentioned above, be opening a door to frequent debates and quarrels, among the ſubjects of the different powers, which could not fail to involve them in a war more expenſive, than all the advantage they derived from the fiſhing could compenſate. Beſides the nations lying moſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, and having the greateſt number of veſſels, would, in ſuch caſe, have a peculiar advantage over thoſe more remote, and whoſe marine are not ſo numerous; and might very probably, after a while, entirely exclude them from any ſhare. For a few European nations to divide it among themſelves, would be equally unjuſt, and equally dangerous to the peace and ſafety of their neighbours, and even to their own peace among themſelves. There remains, therefore, no proſpect of peace and ſafety, but in reſting the matter on the true principle above; which the intereſt of both Europe and America, if duly conſidered, on the large ſcale of mutual advantage and perpetuated peace, will moſt certainly lead them to adopt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:016825_0013_0F9E8297D04FCFD0"/>It has been alledged, that the affair of the fiſhery will be ſettled by the powers now at war, when a peace comes to be made: but it ought to be conſidered, that it belongs not to any of them to diſpoſe of them, unleſs by an act of violence, and confidence in their power to the ſubverſion of juſtice and right.</p>
            <p>Britain, France, and the ſtates, may diſpoſe of their own property as they ſee meet; but may not in juſtice meddle with that of others. The fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eries on the banks of Nova Scotia, iſlands adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, Newfoundland, &amp;c. belong to the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants there, by the grant of the great creator; and the European claim, ſuch as it was, transferred and confirmed them to them. If any alledge, theſe places belong to Britain, and ſhe may diſpoſe of them as ſhe may think proper; I reply, the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for Newfoundland (as mentioned above) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms to the inhabitants there a right to both land and ſea, not to be revoked or forfeited; and whatever part that people may act, either towards the ſubjects of Britain or others, all that Britain can do, according to the expreſs declaration of the charter, is to declare them "out of the allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and protection of Britain; and to be no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger avowed, maintained or defended by her;" but may not rob them of their juſt natural or acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rights. And the grant for the ſettlement of Nova Scotia was <q>unconditional, abſolute, and without any exception or reſervation whatſoever; or whereſoever, of all rights royalties, privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, franchiſes, &amp;c. both by ſea and land, and likewiſe the power of goverment, by laws
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:016825_0014_0F9E8297DDE73A48"/>
to be made by their own legiſlatures,</q> was given for encouraging the ſettlement of the country, which would have been the true intereſt of Britain, to have ſtrictly adhered to and fully complied with: and therefore the people conſider themſelves, equally entitled to their lands and coaſts, and to as free a government of their own, from under the controul of any other, as any of the American ſtates; and hope through the bleſſing of God to maintain it: and hence it is that though their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metropolis has been held by the Britiſh through the preſent war; and their ſtrength is not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to free themſelves as yet of the impoſition, they have notwithſtanding taken no active part on that ſide, but wait for a favorable ſeaſon of deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and to aſſert their ſovereignty, independent freedom and juſt rights inſeperably connected there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. Upon the whole, ſhould peace be eſtabliſhed on the above foundation, it will open the faireſt proſpect of a long uninterupted ſeries of tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to both Europe and America, all ground of diſquiet and diſturbance being entirely removed. But if matters be unhappily ſettled on the footing of Britain retaining any part of American poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, eſpecially to the northward, and the fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eries to be monopolized by one, or divided among more, or fewer of the European powers, whether the ſtates have a ſhare or not, it muſt appear evident on a ſmall degree of reflection, the iſſue muſt be, in all probability, another war in a ſhort ſpace of time, involving in it the inhabitants on both ſides the atlantic, which the true intereſt of
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:016825_0015_0F9E8298EB752AF8"/>
all concerned would certainly lead them by all means to prevent.</p>

            <p>THE eager deſire of moſt people in America to ſee peace return, makes the terms, on which it ought to be ſettled, an object of very great conſequence; and unleſs the ſubject be better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood than at preſent it generally ſeems to be, we ſhall have much greater reaſon to deprecate peace, than a continuation of the war. Peace to America cannot conſiſt in a meer ceſſation from hoſtilities, and withdrawing of armies; but on the principles, on which theſe events may take place, in Europe. Articles of pacification are little elſe than a reſolution to ceaſe from hoſtilities, until one or other of the parties have recovered from the loſſes ſuſtained by the war, or recruited their finances. Modern treaties of perpetual frienſhip
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:016825_0016_0F9E82996D15BB98"/>
and peace, ſcarcely ever exiſt as long as antient truces, which had no other object but a renewal of the war, after a few years breathing. Theſe kinds of pacification can never anſwer any valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able end to America; the principles on which ſhe ought to make peace, ſhould be ſuch as would ſecure her from new wars, if ſhe means to be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, or to enjoy the beſt advantages of a revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Many will ſay, what occaſion to write on a ſubject ſo diſtant? firſt ſhew us that there is a proſpect of overtures. To this I reply, that we are at leaſt twelve months behind in information on the ſubject; and ſhould the terms on which we ought to ſheath the ſword become the topic of occaſional converſation, for the whole time; we ſhould not be too well prepared for entering on the buſineſs: and I think the political ſtate of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, make overtures probable by the cloſe of the campaign. The object is large and very exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, embracing the intereſts not only of the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligerent powers, but of every principal ſtate in Europe as well as America. We are young and not over expert in the knowledge of every national concern: all men can ſee what fate muſt await us, if we diſcover as little ſkill in negociation as in finance, or many other objects of public attention. It is not uncommon, for a nation to recover, by the terms of pacification, as much as ſhe loſt by the ſword; and tho' the war be unfortunate, the peace may be advantageous. It requires a man to be well acquainted with the circumſtances and intereſts of his own nation, and of thoſe powers with whom he may either formally or eventually be connected,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:016825_0017_0F9E829A90E48620"/>
as well as thoſe of the enemy, to be qualified to aſſiſt in a negociation for peace. Whenever that event takes place, if the terms be good and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for America, ſhe may enjoy perpetual tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility, and be on terms of amity and friendſhip with every nation, which may viſit her coaſts, or enter her ports; and it is plain therefore that the pacification muſt comprehend the general and common intereſts of all. But if the terms be not ſuch as comprehend all, ſhe ſtands a very great chance to change enemies; but never to enjoy untroubled ſecurity. Dear bought experience has taught us to know, that the ſcalping knife and tomahawk are equally employed, to butcher our innocent back ſettlers, while any nation poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes territory either to the eaſtward, or in any other quarter, on this ſide of the Miſſiſippi. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada, Nova Scotia, and Louiſiana, in the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of France or Great Britain, are alike hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile to America; and ſhe could never be ſafe in the neighbourhood of either.</p>
            <p>France, whoſe motives will appear the more juſt, and meaſures more generous and diſinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted, the more they are examined, has wiſely ceded all her claims on theſe countries. Had ſhe diſcovered any reluctance on this head, ſhe would have ſown the ſeeds of jealouſy and diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution in the very vitals of the treaty of amity, into which ſhe has entered with the American States. By cheerfully relinquiſhing her claim, ſhe has removed all cauſe of uneaſineſs, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed every apprehenſion of ſiniſter deſigns, and united them to her for ever: but as much as it is
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:016825_0018_0F9E829AF8D32E20"/>
her intereſt and theirs to be on terms of friendſhip with each other, ſo much it is the intereſt of both, that Britain retain no claim to any part of theſe countries; and a peace without our inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence and connexion with them, would only be the cauſe of new wars, and involve both in the repetition of their preſent troubles and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence: for Britain to be our neighbour is to have Britain our enemy. No proverb more true than that, "He who injures, can never forgive," and Britain having once injured, can never forgive America. To live at peace, therefore, with each other, Britiſh power muſt be as far removed from us as her iſlands are: this therefore, though too little thought of, is a point of the laſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; but there is one other, perhaps leſs attended to, which is yet of more importance, and on the right ſettlement of which, the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and extenſion of our commerce will greatly, if not principally, depend; and it is a point, which is equally intereſting to every European power, whoſe ſubjects either are, or may become mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, and who wiſh to feel the enriching in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of commerce: this is to prevent any European power claiming any ſhare in our fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eries, and to guarantee them only to the inhabitants of the adjacent ſtates, to whom they properly belong, as may appear more fully from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding numbers.—Britain uſurping it, became miſtreſs of the ocean, and ſo would any other European power. America poſſeſſing it, becomes only an object of a more extenſive and lucrative commerce, which muſt appear evident to every
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:016825_0019_0F9E829BA5798950"/>
intelligent perſon. Every part of America is poſſeſſed of a landed ſtaple commodity; excepting that, on the coaſts of which, fiſh are caught in the greateſt abundance; to them Nature ſeems to have allotted this ſtaple, and by means of it to connect them with the diſtant nations: fixing peace on theſe principles, America becomes the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon mart of Europe, where every one will find the article he wants, and the purchaſer of what he has to diſpoſe of.—But divide it between any foreign powers, in whole, or in part, quarrelling, confuſion and animoſity will be the unceaſing conſequence. Poſſeſſion in common of any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, which can be improved and enjoyed, is as impoſſible among nations, as among individuals. The weaker muſt always ſuffer, and the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages in trade, which the European powers will poſſeſs, who do not alſo poſſeſs a full ſhare in the fiſhery, will be very ſmall, and to divide it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all, would be to ſow the ſeeds of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual contention, and in a great meaſure to defeat their intentions, in wiſhing our independence, and often involve us in diſagreeable altercations.— They, who have the land, can alone enjoy and improve the fiſhery to general and equal advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: Europe will be their market, and Europe will reap the benefits of their traffic; a general circuitous and very profitable trade will be the conſequence, and no one power will poſſeſs any naval advantage over another. The juſtneſs and generoſity of the policy of France, in relinquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all claims to the land, leaves no room to doubt of their acting on the ſame principles, with
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:016825_0020_0F9E829C5BDB5900"/>
regard to the fiſhery, whenever applied to, on the ſubject; and the haughty and imperious conduct of Britain to the mercantile and neutral powers of Europe, ſhews plainly what they are to expect from her, ſhould ſhe continue to derive the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of ſeamen from the fiſhery, which ſhe has hitherto done.</p>
            <p>It is therefore the intereſt of all Europe to turn their eyes to this object, and to oblige Britain to give up every pretenſion thereto. On this head, the ſtipulations ought to be very clear and deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive; and that power alone ſhould poſſeſs it, in whoſe poſſeſſion it becomes an inexhauſtible ſource of general advantage to all, without proving a bone of contention to any. Let them act wiſely, and they will reap plentifully, but neglecting the preſent opportunity, they will one day feel the folly of their inattention.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude by obſerving to thoſe powers that are in purſuit of imaginary honour, that in a righteous cauſe, and the juſt defence of a man's country, all actions of valour are indeed juſt reaſons of praiſe; but in all other caſes, victory and conqueſt are no more than murder and rapine; and every one is to be deteſted as the greateſt enemy to mankind, that is moſt active herein. Thoſe are only true heroes, who moſt benefit the world, by promoting the peace, wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, and good of mankind: but ſuch as oppreſs it with the ſlaughter of men, deſolation of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, the burning of cities, and the other cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities which attend war, are the ſcourges of God, and the greateſt plagues and calamities that
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:016825_0021_0F9E829D29F74170"/>
can happen to it; <hi>and</hi> which are never ſent into the world but for the puniſhment of it; and therefore ought, as ſuch, to be prayed againſt, and deteſted by all mankind.</p>
            <p>ALEXANDER the great, and Julius Caeſar, were two of the moſt eminent conquerors perhaps to be met with in hiſtory, yet their victories and and conqueſts were ſo far from being advantages to them, that on the contrary they terminated in their death and ruin, the whole royal families of Philip king of Macedon, and of Alexander the the great his ſon, were utterly extirpated within the ſpace of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

Thus theſe two kings, who by their oppreſſive and deſtructive wars had made many tragedies in the families of other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and people, had them all at length, by the juſt ordination of providence, brought home to their own.</p>
            <p>Julius Caeſar fought fifty battles without miſſing of ſucceſs in any one of them, unleſs at Pharus, where he ſwam for his life; and once at Dyrra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chium, and in theſe battles he is ſaid to have ſlain one million one hundred and ninety two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men; which proves him to have been the great cut-throat of the age in which he lived. What is the fruit he reaped from theſe victories? His own blood is ſhed in the ſenate, being ſlain there, even by ſome whom, he had moſt highly obliged: and dying childleſs, his nephew Octavius,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:016825_0022_0F9E829E18225070"/>
whom he had adopted, ſwam to the empire alſo in torrents of blood; and at length left it to the poſterity of Authony, whom he had conquered: for none of Octavius's (i. e. Auguſtus's) poſterity ever enjoyed the empire. Theſe bloody men were raiſed up, in the holy and righteous provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, as ſcourges in his hand, for the puniſhment of the wickedneſs of the age in which they lived; the work was God's; but it being malice, revenge and ambition, that excited them to be the inſtruments in the execution of it, they juſtly had for ther reward thereof that deſtruction by which they fell; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

               </gap>, that they uſually make the actions of war, bloodſhed, and conqueſt, the ſubjects of their higheſt encomiums; and thoſe their moſt celebrated heroes, that moſt excel therein.</p>
            <p>I ſhall further add, that neither Britain nor France, can expect to hold any part in America, but by ſhedding of innocent blood and loſs of the affection of the people. Let people therefore from every quarter of Europe, come and ſettle in America, there can he no cauſe of complaint when all people of fair moral characters, from every quarter, will meet with equal encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. What can Europe have to fear from a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their own people? Nor will there be any great danger of any one ſtate, injuring another; as by their ſeveral conſtitutions, ſuch a quick rota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their officers of government, will prevent their forming plans or ſchemes, againſt either
