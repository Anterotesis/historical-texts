         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>o Thousand Years and upwards. Food and Physick were then one and the same Thing.</p>
            <p>BUT when Men began to pass from a Vegetable to an Animal Diet, and feed on Flesh, Fowls, and Fish, then Seasonings grew necessary, both to render it more palatable and savoury, and also to preserve that Part which was not immediately spent from Stinking and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: And probably, Salt was the first Seasoning dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd; for of Salt we read, <hi>Gen. xiv.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND this seems to be necessary, especially for those who were advanced in Age, whose Palates, with their Bodies, had lost their Vigour as to Taste, whose deges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Faculty grew weak and impotent, and thence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the Use of Soops and savoury M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sses; so that Cookery then began to become a Science, though Luxury had not brought it to the Height of an Art. Thus we read, that <hi>Jacob</hi> made such palatable Pottage, that <hi>Esau</hi> purchased a Mess of it at the extravagant Price of his Birthright. And <hi>Isaac,</hi> before by his last Will and Testament he bequeathed his Blessing to his Son <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sau,</hi> required him to make some savoury Meat, such as his Soul loved, <hi>i. e.</hi> such as was relishable to his blunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Palate,</p>
            <p>SO that Seasonings of some Sort were then in Use; though whether they were Salt, savoury Herbs, or
<pb facs="unknown:005061_0004_1016991B54B529A8"/>
Roots only; or Spices, the Fruits of Trees, such as Pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, Cloves, Nutmegs; Bark, as Cinamon; Roots, as Ginger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I shall not determine.</p>
            <p>AS for the Methods of the Cookery of those Times, boiling or stewing seems to have been the Principal; broiling or roasting the next; besides which, I presume, scarce any other were used for two Thousand Years and more; for I remember no other in the History of <hi>Genesis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THAT <hi>Esau</hi> was the first Cook, I shall not presume to assert; for <hi>Abraham</hi> gave Order to dress a fatted Calf; but <hi>Esau</hi> is the first Person mentioned that made any Advances beyond plain Dressing, as boiling, roast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For tho' we find indeed, that <hi>Rebeccah</hi> his Mother was accomplished with the Skill of making savoury Meat as well as he, yet whether he learned it from her, or she from him, is a Question too knotty for me to determine.</p>
            <p>BUT Cookery did not long remain a simple Science, or a bare Piece of Housewifery or Family Oeconomy, but in process of Time, when Luxury enter'd the World, it grew to an Art, nay, a Trade; for, in <hi>1 Sam. viii. 13.</hi> when the <hi>Israelites</hi> grew Fashionists, and would have a King, that they might be like the rest of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, we read of Cooks, Confectioners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS Art being of universal Use, and in constant Practice, has been ever since upon the Improvement; and we may, I think, with good Reason, believe, is ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd at its greatest Height and Perfection, if it is not got beyond it, even to its Declension; for whatsoever new, upstart, out of the-way Messes some Humou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>hing, rather than improving the Art itself.</p>
            <p>THE Art of Cookery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is indeed diversified ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Diversity of Nations or Countries; and to treat of it in that La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

of Practicalness and Usefulness, and so within the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of a Manual that shall neither burthen the Hands to hold, the Eyes in reading, nor the Mind in conceiving.</p>
            <p>WHAT you will find in the following Sheets, are Directions generally for dressing after the best, most na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and wholesome Manner, such Provisions as are the Product of our own Country, and in such a Manner as is most agreeable to <hi>English</hi> Palates; saving that I have so far temporized as, since we have to our Disgrace so fondly admired the <hi>French</hi> Tongue, <hi>French</hi> Modes, and also <hi>French</hi> Messes, to present you now and then with such Receipts of <hi>French</hi> Cookery, as I think may not be disagreeable to <hi>English</hi> Palates.</p>
            <p>THERE are indeed already in the World various Books that treat on this Subject, and which bear great Names, as Cooks to Kings, Princes, and Noblemen, and from which one might justly expect something more than many, if not most of these I have read, perform, but found my self deceived in my Expectations; for many of them to us are impracticable, others whimsical, others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palatable, unless to depraved Palates, some unwholsome, many Things copied from old Authors, and recommended without (as I am persuaded) the Copiers ever having had any Experience of the Palatableness, or had any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Wholsomness of them: Which two Things ought to be the standing Rules, that no Pretenders to Cookery ought to deviate from. And I cannot but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that those celebrated Performers, notwithstanding all their Professions of having ingeniously communicated their Art, industriously concealed their best Receipts from the Publick.</p>
            <p>BUT what I here present the World with, is the Product of my own Experience, and that for the Space of thirty Years and upwards, during which Time, I have been constantly employed in fashionable and noble Families, in which the Provisions order'd according to the following Directions, have had the general Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ion of such as have been at many noble Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:005061_0006_1016991CDD61F900"/>THESE Receipts are all suitable to <hi>English</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions and <hi>English</hi> Palates, wholsome, toothsome, all practicable and easy to be perform'd. Here are those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for a frugal, and also for a sumptuous Table; and if rightly observed, will prevent the spoiling of many a good Dish of Meat, the waste of many good Materials, the Vexation that frequently attends such Mismanage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the Curses not unfrequently bestowed on Cooks, with the usual Reflection, that whereas <hi>God sends good Meat, the Devil sends Cooks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AS to those Parts that treat of Confectionary, Pickles, Cordials, <hi>English</hi> Wines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> what I have said in relation to Cookery, is equally applicable to them also.</p>
            <p>IT is true, I have not been so numerous in Receipts as some who have gone before me, but I think I have made amends in giving none but what are approved and practicable, and fit either for a genteel or a noble Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and altho' I have omitted odd and fantastical Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, yet I have set down a considerable Number of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts.</p>
            <p>THE Treatise is divided into ten Tarts: Cookery contains above an hundred Receipts, Pickles fifty, Pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings above fifty, Pastry above forty, Cakes forty, Creams and Jellies above forty, Preserving an Hundred, Made Wines forty, Cordial Waters and Powders above seventy, Medicines and Salves above two Hundred: In all near eight Hundred.</p>
            <p>AS for the Receipts for Medicines, Salves, Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, good in several Diseases, Wounds, Hurts, Brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, Aches, Pains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which amount to above two Hundred, they are generally Family Receipts, that have never been made publick; excellent in their Kind, and approved Remedies, which have not be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n obtained by me without much Difficulty; and of such Efficacy in Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to which they are appropriated, that they have cured when all other Means have failed; and a few of them which I have communicated to a Friend, have procured a very handsome Livelihood.</p>
            <p>THEY are very proper for those Generous, Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and Christian Gentlewomen that have a Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

            <p>AS the Whole of this Collection has cost me much Pains, and a thirty Years diligent Application, and I have had Experience of their Use and Efficacy, I hope they will be as kindly accepted, as by me they are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously offered, to the Publick: And if they prove to the Advantage of many, the End will be answered that is proposed by her that is ready to serve the Publick in what she may.</p>

Eight or nine Spoonfuls is sufficient for the strongest, a less Quantity to those younger, or of a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Constitution, as you may judge of their Strength; ten or twelve for a Horse or Bullock; three, four, or five for a Sheep, Hog, or Dog.</p>
                  <p>This must be given within nine Days after the Bite; and it never fails either in Man or Beast. If you can conveniently, bind some of the Ingredients on the Wound.</p>
