            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Funeral Sermon.</head>
            <head>LORD'S-DAY Morning, Feb. 18. 1727,8.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>2 KINGS II. 12. 13.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <hi>AND</hi> Elisha <hi>saw it and He cried,</hi> MY FATHER MY FATHER, THE CHARIOT OF ISRAEL AND THE HORSEMEN THEREOF: <hi>and He saw Him no more: and He took hold of his own Cloaths and rent them in two pieces: He took up also the Mantle of</hi> ELIJAH <hi>that fell from Him.</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE Words contain the passionate Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations &amp; Behaviour of <hi>Elisha,</hi> upon the surprizing Rapture of his Master ELIJAH from Him up towards Heaven.</p>
            <p>THIS extraordinary Prophet being aware of this approaching Event, He seems to be scrupulous whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any shou'd be with Him at the wonderful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant. He therefore begs even <hi>Elisha,</hi> who had very faithfully ministred to Him in his laborious Office and was appointed his chief Successor, to tarry when He set out from <hi>Gilgal,</hi> and then at <hi>Bethel</hi> and <hi>Jericho,</hi> while He travelled further at the Divine Direction. But both <hi>Elisha</hi> and the other <hi>Sons of the Prophets</hi> had been by some means or other apprized, that ELIJAH was to be this Day taken away in an extraordinary manner. And while <hi>Fifty</hi> of them went
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:003094_0004_0000000000000000"/>
and stood on some eminent Ascent to view afar off and see what wou'd happen; <hi>Elisha</hi> resolves to keep Him company to the moment of his Departure.</p>
            <p>BUT ELIJAH was to pass the River <hi>Jordan</hi> in order to his Translation, And when they came to the Banks, He took his Mantle and wrapt it together and smote the Waters, and they were divided hither and thither; so that they two went over on dry Ground. And as they still went on and talked â€” And Oh, how divine and heavenly was the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse! â€” Behold there appeared a <hi>Chariot of Fire and Horses of Fire,</hi> which parted them asunder, and ELIJAH went up by a <hi>Whirlwind</hi> into Heaven.</p>
            <p>THE Chariot &amp; Horses of Fire cou'd be only bright appearances in such distinguishing Figures. And they were no doubt a sort of pure material Substances which the Holy <hi>Angels</hi> made use of to do the greater Honour to this highly favoured Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet in his triumphant Ascention. Whether it were a peculiar sort of substance as pure as that of Light, annexed to their Spirits (as our Bodies are to ours) and they carry always about them for their various and continual uses; or whether a Substance they oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casionally seized for this particular end; it is easy to imagine, those mighty <hi>Intelligences</hi> cou'd when they please put it into such a singular Arrangement and Action as to give it the appearance of a shining Body, and to dispose it into what Figures were proper to accomplish their divine Commission.</p>
            <p>AND it seems very plain as if <hi>Elisha</hi> saw ELIJAH ascend into the Chariot. For wherefore shou'd there be the appearance of such a <hi>Medium</hi> of conveyance, unless it were in a visible manner to receive &amp; trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the ascending Prophet? And even the Vapours of this inferiour <hi>Atmosphaere</hi> are very strongly mov'd into a rising Aeddy or Whirlwind, as a suitable Instrument in the safe Hands of <hi>Angels</hi> to raise the Prophet as high as the Air extends; and then they
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:003094_0005_0000000000000000"/>
wou'd proceed to carry Him by their more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Power.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>AND</hi> Elisha <hi>saw it, and He cried, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>HE saw it,</hi>â€”and happy it was for Him; Inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as this was the Token which had just before been given Him, that He shou'd have a double Portion of ELIJAH'S Spirit: and the very Power of <hi>Seeing</hi> this Angelical Appearance seems to be a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Favour and Work of GOD, and as much a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle at the seeing the like Appearance afterwards by <hi>Elisha's</hi> Servant when his Eyes were opened, 2 Kings. VI. 17.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>AND He cried</hi>â€”as one that was greatly mov'd at the Parting of his most dear and admired Master.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>MY Father! My Father!</hi>â€”As a Declaration of ELIJAH'S great Superiority both in Age, Graces, Gifts, Authority; and as a filial Expression of the highest Reverence and Affection for Him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THE Chariot-of Israel and the Horsemen thereof.</hi> He plainly takes the Metaphor from the present Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the <hi>Chariot &amp; Horses</hi> before his Eyes. From the view of <hi>these</hi> receiving and rising up with the <hi>Prophet,</hi> He cries out after <hi>Him,</hi> as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting Chariot and Horsemen of <hi>Israel;</hi> i.e. Their Strength and Glory, their Defence &amp; Safety. <note n="(v)" place="bottom">Varii in <abbr>Pol.</abbr> Synops.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>AND He saw Him no more.â€”</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HE doubtless looked after Him till both ELIJAH and the fiery Chariot had ascended out of sight; and then He saw Him no moreâ€” a sorrowful Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, implying the melancholy Loss of <hi>Him</hi> whose Company had been the Delight of his Heart, and whose Presence was his Eyes Desire.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:003094_0006_0000000000000000"/>
               <hi>AND He took hold of his own Cloaths, and rent them into two pieces.</hi> An antient Token of great and inexpressible Sorrow. A Passionate Action that signified how their Hearts were rent with Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress and Anguish, what little Comfort they took in any thing left, as if they cared not what wou'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of their Bodies, and how little they minded the things that were most ornamental or useful for them. <note n="j" place="bottom">A Jackson on Gen. 37. 29.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>HE took up also the Mantle of</hi> ELIJAH <hi>that fell from Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ANY thing left of ELIJAH was dear to Him, and especially the characteristical Mantle which He seems to have dropped as He was ascending into the Chariot. And <hi>Elisha</hi> readily takes it up, both out of Esteem and Affection to Him, as a precious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main &amp; Memorial of Him, and as a sacred Instrument He wou'd make great use of, both for the Glory of GOD and his own Advantage. And thus He quickly applies it in smiting and dividing the Waters, as ELIJAH before Him, and returning thro' <hi>Jordan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HAVING thus descanted briefly on the Text, our OBSERVATIONS may now be theseâ€”</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. EMINENT Ministers have the style of <hi>Fathers</hi> very properly given them.</item>
               <item>2. THEY are in a great measure the Glory, Strength, Defence &amp; Safety of a People.</item>
               <item>3. IT is a very melancholy thing to loose them and see them no more.</item>
               <item>4. THEIR Departure should be sadly resented and express'd by Survivours.</item>
               <item>5. <hi>and lastly,</hi> WE Shou'd highly value and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully improve the Remains of their Ministry.</item>

            <p n="1">
               <abbr>Obs.</abbr> I. <hi>THAT eminent Ministers have the style of</hi> Fathers <hi>very Properly given them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:003094_0007_0000000000000000"/>THIS on many accounts is one of the most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Titles among the Sons of Men. It origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally comprizes in it a Priority in Nature, Existence or Age; a Derivation of Being and Good things to others; a superiority of Knowledge, Wisdom, Power, Authority and Government; a gracious, tender and condescending Affection to those who are under them, are derived from them, or are dependent on them; a great <hi>Concern &amp; Care</hi> for their Welfare; and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Expression of <hi>this,</hi> in Providing for, supporting, desending them, and in <hi>Promoting</hi> their Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessâ€”as by instruction, Example, Council, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, Correction, Incouragement, and by all proper measures that can be devised.</p>
            <p>SUCH things as these are contain'd in the complex Term of a <hi>Father.</hi> And what more excellent Ideas are found in any humane Title whatever? No won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then that the greatest, best and wisest of Princes, Kings and Emperors have chose to be styled <hi>the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of their People;</hi> as comprehending and exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting every thing both superior, indearing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireable in their Relation to them. And thus even the most Glorious GOD is pleased to entitle Himself <hi>the Father of all</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Eph. IV 6.</note>: CHRIST is called <hi>the Everlasting Father</hi> with respect to his People <note n="â€ " place="bottom">Isa IX 6.</note>: and the FIRST PERSON in the adorable Trinity, <hi>the Father of CHRIST.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>AND upon many of those accounts above mentioned is this Title applied to <hi>Ministers,</hi> and especially the more ancient and eminent, in the sacred Writings <note n="â€–" place="bottom">1 Cor. IV. 15. 1 Thef. II. 11. 1 Tim V. 1.</note>. Thus <hi>Elisha</hi> cried out in the Text to his Master ELIJAHâ€”<hi>My Father, My Father.</hi> And the same Title did a great King of <hi>Israel</hi> bestow on <hi>Elisha,</hi> a few years after, 2 Kings XIII. 14. <hi>Now</hi> Elisha <hi>was fallen sick of his sickness where of He died; and Joash</hi>

               <hi>the King of</hi> Israel <hi>came down unto Him, and wept over his Face, and said</hi> â€” O MY FATHER, MY FATHER! <hi>the Chariot of</hi> Israel <hi>and the Horsemen thereof.</hi>

            <p>AND how properly is this Title appliedâ€”</p>
            <p>FOR as they grow up in Eminence, they grow superior in Age, in Knowledge, Wisdom &amp; Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and in every Excellence that makes them more esteemed &amp; venerable. They become the Means of the spiritual Regeneration of many, and so the spiritual Fathers of many spiritual Children: and for these they have a very fatherly Affection &amp; Care. They instruct, advise, forewarn, exhort, reprove, and also chasten with their spiritual Discipline. They govern their People, not with a lordly, but parental Authority; full of Condescention, Impartiality, wisdom &amp; Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, as a Father his natural Offspring. In fine, They Provide for their spiritual Wants, defend them from their spiritual Dangers, incourage and comfort them, seek after their Salvation and Happiness; and set such Examples as to draw their People's Affection, as well as raise their high esteem &amp; Reverence.</p>
            <p>IN such respects as these, may <hi>eminent Ministers</hi> be very properly called our <hi>Fathers:</hi> especially when they grow riper with Age, Experience and Goodness, and come to cast a Veneration round about them.</p>
            <p>BUT our</p>
            <p n="2">II. <abbr>Obs.</abbr> is, <hi>That these eminent Fathers are in a great measure</hi> the Glory, Strength, Defence and Safety <hi>of their People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As they are Neighbours with respect to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, their Views &amp; Cares are extended to the whole of the Species. They are greatly concerned for the Welfare of all: And as they are dear to GOD, and have a powerful Interest at the Throne of Grace, they earnestly Pray for the same, and as far as their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:003094_0009_0000000000000000"/>
can reach they endeavour it. Like the Lights of Heaven, tho' they move in their proper Orbs, they send out their Virtues to the remotest Regions. And in these respects they may well be accounted the Glory, Strength, Defence &amp; Safety of this lower World.</p>
            <p>BUT they are especially so, with respect to the People among whom they dwell. For all this seems to be signified in their being styled <hi>The Chariot of</hi> Israel <hi>and the Horsemen thereof.</hi> For these are <hi>mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> Terms: and Chariots and Horsemen, were in antient Times, the warlike Glory and Strength of Kingdoms, as well as their Defence and Safety.</p>
            <p>INDEED, The great and blessed GOD in CHRIST is these in a most transcendent manner <note n="*" place="bottom">Psal. LXXXIX. 17,18 Isa. XXVIII. 5,6. Zech II 5.</note> And between Him and the most eminent Ministers there is no Comparison. They derive all they have intirely from Him, they perpetually depend on his Influence, and they are as nothing and less than nothing before Him. They can neither preserve, nor defend, nor strengthen, nor move, nor shine, nor exist without Him: and all that they have and perform is but by a diminutive Ray of Power and Light streaming forth from Him the Fountain and acting in them.</p>
            <p>AND, next to this most Glorious BEING, but in an infinitely lower Degree, we must ascribe the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to his <hi>Holy and powerful Angels,</hi> who are vastly superiour in Strength and Wisdom to the most eminent Men. They are mighty to save; and as a flaming Fire they burn, as a flash of Light they fly to do his Pleasure for his Covenant-People. <hi>Psal.</hi> CIII. 20, 21.&amp; CIV. 4.</p>
            <p>IN this lower World, in it's present State, they for the most part keep themselves invisible. But we read of their continual Presence and Agency, in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:003094_0010_0000000000000000"/>
of Truth: And sometimes they brake out and discover themselves. Sometimes in the Forms of most <hi>lovely Men,</hi> and at others they only give us the <hi>bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Ensigns</hi> of their active Presence. Thus they did in the Chariots and Horses of Fire to these two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; and thus afterwards, both to <hi>Elisha</hi> and his astonished Servant; when the King of <hi>Syria</hi> had sent <hi>Horses and Chariots, and a great Host,</hi> to seize on <hi>Elisha</hi> in <hi>Dothan,</hi> and <hi>they came by night and incompass'd the City round about.</hi> 2 Kings VI.15-17. <hi>And when the Servant of the Man of GOD was risen early and gone forth, behold an Host compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the City, both with Horses and Chariots: and his Servant said unto Him,</hi> Alas! my Master! How shall we do? <hi>And He answered,</hi> Fear not, for they that be with us are more than they that be with them. <hi>And</hi> Elisha <hi>prayed &amp; said,</hi> Lord I pray thee open his Eyes that He may see. <hi>And the Lord opened the Eves of the young Man, and He saw: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Mountain was full of Horses &amp; Chariots of Fire round about</hi> Elisha.</p>
            <p>THESE Horses and Chariots of Fire were only the <hi>visible Ensigns</hi> of an <hi>Host of Angels:</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet informs us, they were more in number than <hi>the Great Host</hi> that incompassed the City. And by the Story it seems they were at the same, time visible to the favoured Prophet, while they were not so to the Servant with Him. And this seems plainly to intimate that these powerful Agents may make a very shining Appearance about us, which may be clearly seen both to themselves, and those whose Eyes are formed to discern the Vision, while the Eyes of others in their natural Frame are uncapable of it. Thus there are great numbers of <hi>Stars</hi> in the Firmament that diffuse their glorious Beams around us; and some perceive them, while others see nothing in the Places where they appear but a perfect Blank or Darkness. And there are a great many others of these <hi>heavenly Lamps</hi> that pour their Rays into every Eye, and yet are seen by none till some optical Instrument be set before us, and then we discover them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:003094_0011_0000000000000000"/>BUT yet <hi>eminent Ministers</hi> are in a great Degree the Glory and Safety of the People they live with. So <hi>Elisha</hi> pronounces of his Master ELIJAH, even in the Presence of <hi>Angels</hi> that were taking Him up to bare Him away. <hi>My Father, my Father!</hi>â€” You are got into a glorious Chariot with Horses of Fire â€” <hi>But</hi> THOU <hi>art the Chariot of</hi> Israel <hi>and the Horsemen thereof</hi> â€” And what shall we do when thou art taken away?</p>
            <p>NOR was this a Title peculiar to the Prophet ELI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>JAH. We have the same ascribed to his Successor <hi>Elisha,</hi> as He was departing by a natural Death, in that forementioned 1 Kings XIII. 14. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever other eminent Ministers have been like to them in their Day, among a Covenant-People, may as well be styled <hi>the Chariots of</hi> Israel <hi>and the Horsemen thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ON what accounts were they the agreable subjects of this illustrious Character; but for their shining Light, their burning Zeal, their servent Prayers, their laborious Indeavours for the Revival of pure &amp; dying Religion in <hi>Israel?</hi> By this means they appeared the Glory of that degenerate People, they kept them from a total Apostacy, they preserved the Life of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion among them, they prevailed with GOD to spare them from ruinous Judgments, and often to prosper them against their powerful Enemies.</p>
            <p>AND when there are other eminent Ministers in a degenerate Land, who shine &amp; burn as they, with an heavenly Life and flaming Zeal, with servent Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions to GOD, and earnest addresses to <hi>Men</hi> to turn and be saved â€” Like those two Prophets, they must needs be the Glory and Safety of the People they live with.</p>
            <p>AND what tho' they be Men of like <hi>Infirmities and Passions</hi> with others; yet this no more hinders them, from this destinguishing Character than it did
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:003094_0012_0000000000000000"/>
ELIJAH of old. For of Him the Apostle observes in Jam. V. 11. ELIAS <hi>was a man subject to like Passions as we are.</hi> He has been styled by some a very zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and fiery spirited Prophet. In his Zeal He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded all the Priests of <hi>Baal,</hi> 
               <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>nine hundred and fifty</hi> to be slain at once, and would not suffer so much as <hi>one</hi> to escape <note n="*" place="bottom">1 King. XVIII.</note> He prayed for <hi>Fire</hi> to come down from Heaven and destroy <hi>two Captains</hi> with their <hi>Fifties</hi> successively, when they were sent by the King of <hi>Israel</hi> to bid Him come down to him <note n="â€ " place="bottom">1 King. I.</note>. At other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times He seem'd to be much discontented that He had no better success and acceptance, and at the Persecution and Hatred of Enemies. In some Hours of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion He was too weary of Life; He wish'd He might die, and too much complains of the Hardships and Ill-treatment He met with <note n="â€¡" place="bottom">1. King XIX.</note> And yet after all, He was the <hi>Chariot</hi> of <hi>Israel,</hi> their Glory and Safety.</p>
            <p>AND much less can the <hi>Hatred, Reproaches or Persecutions</hi> of any debarr them of this eminent Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. For ELIJAH was called by <hi>Ahab</hi> the <hi>Troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of Israel,</hi> 1 King. XVIII. 16. And <hi>Jazebel</hi> was his inveterate Enemy, vow'd his Destruction, and made Him fly &amp; hide for his Life, 1 King XIX.6, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>IN the midst of all their Imperfections &amp; Sufferings, they live a heavenly Life, they instruct by their Doctrine, they oppose the Torrent of prevailing Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, they fight against the Powers of Darkness, they carry the Standard, and they lead in the van of the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle: they have a powerful Interest in the Courts above, they improve it incessantly in importunate Prayers for the People they live with in a particular manner: and they contrive and try every method to preserve and advance the Religion of CHRIST, in the Power, Practice and Purity of it, upon which only depends their Safety &amp; Happiness.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:003094_0013_0000000000000000"/>OUR</p>
            <p n="3">III. <abbr>Obs.</abbr> therefore is this, <hi>That it is a very me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy thing to loose them and see them no more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>COMFORTABLE indeed it is to think, that since they have left us, they are gone to Heaven. They have ceased from Sinning and Sorrowing, they are divested of all their Infirmities, compleatly purged from their Corruptions, made perfect in Light and Holiness; released from all their Cares, Pains, Toils and Burdens; have rested from their wearisom Labours, and their good works have followed them in a full Retribution of Joy and Glory.</p>
            <p>BUT this would have been their Portion if they had tarried <hi>longer</hi> with us: and there was no need of their being taken away, in order to secure this Rest and Happiness. If they had been continued longer, even as long as they cou'd have been useful to us, either by their Preaching, Conversation or living Examples; their future Glory wou'd have been in no wise indanger'd or lessened; a greater weight and measure had been rather laid up and ready to crown them. It would have been far more comfortable and advantagious to <hi>Us;</hi> and even <hi>They</hi> would have had their Consolations, and Supports enough even Here, with their future Prospects, to make amends for all their Labours, Pains and Sorrows while conversant with us.</p>
            <p>To <hi>loose them</hi> then, i. e. to loose their Company in this Present State, where we only want it; To loose it in the midst of its delightful usefulness, and to see them no more â€” must needs be very melancholy to those who knew them, who used to see and hear them, and converse with them.</p>
            <p>To <hi>see them no more</hi> â€” is no more to see their grave or smiling Countenance; no more to see their gracious and reviving Looks; no more to see their decent and comely Carriage; no more to hear their lively &amp; pleasant Voice, their flaming Sermons, their
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:003094_0014_0000000000000000"/>
Preaching CHRIST, their learned pious most instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive and entertaining Converse; no more to hear or see them in our Pulpits, to meet them in our Streets, or to receive them in our Houses! In fine, no more to have their earnest Prayers, their ready Help, their wise Advices, their great and quickning Influence in these degenerate times â€” But to loose them all, and to loose them for ever â€” O inexpressible Loss! insupportable Bereavement!</p>
            <p>To lose a more <hi>Private</hi> Friend is a sorrowful Providence. But to loose a <hi>Publick</hi> Friend, a Friend to our Souls, a most able and faithful one, a zealous and great Promoter of our everlasting Interests: One who studied and laid out Himself to do us all the Good He cou'd, that appeared to be most earnest for our Salvation, and that grudg'd at no Pains nor La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to secure it to us: An ardent Lover of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple He liv'd with; full of Zeal for the Publick In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, for the Cause of pure, vital and practical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion among all about Him; yea for the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensive Kingdom and Glory of CHRIST, and the bringing as many as possible to the saving and happy Acquaintance with Him.</p>
            <p>THE Loss of such as these must be very great and dismal, especially in Times of growing Declensions, when we have most need of them. And in proportion to their Eminence in Gifts and Graces, the greater and sadder the Loss: and this greater still, when on all accounts there are none left like them.</p>
            <p>How dark is the Day when such a burning and shining Light is extinguished among us, or rather carried out of our sight, to blaze among others in the Worlds above; but to leave us in these gloomy Regions, and without any Hopes of it's returning again till the Heavens be no more!</p>
            <p>OUR</p>
            <p n="4">IV. <abbr>Obs.</abbr> therefore naturally follows from this, <hi>That their Departure should be very sadly resented and expressed by Survivours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:003094_0015_0000000000000000"/>So <hi>Elisha</hi> sets us the agreable Pattern. He first cries out in an Agony â€” <hi>My Father, my Father, the Chariot of Israel and the Horsemen thereof</hi> â€” and when ELIJAH was gone quite out of sight, and <hi>Elisha</hi> saw Him no more; then to express the greatness of the Anguish within Him, He takes hold of his own Cloaths and tares them into two pieces. It was an ancient signification of extraordinary Grief. And so deeply affected is <hi>Elisha</hi> with this most sore Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reavement, that tho' He was now all alone as to <hi>Men,</hi> yet He thus rends his Cloaths and vents his Sorrows in the Presence of GOD and his <hi>Angels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ONE wou'd think <hi>Elisha</hi> had but little Reason to be in such great Distress; since ELIJAH was now gone to Heaven in so glorious and triumphant a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>Elisha</hi> had been anointed his next Successor, and promis'd a double Portion of ELIJAH'S Spirit to discharge the Office; and now the Great Man was gone that shone so much above Him, but now had left Him the prime Place of Prophetick Power and Dignity. But all these Apprehensions are quite swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in the high Esteem and Reverence He bare to his departed Master. He rightly judged there was no Man like ELIJAH: and tho' He himself was to have a double Portion of his extraordinary Spirit in comparison with other Prophets, was left as it were his Eldest Son with a double Portion to the Rest of the Children; yet He expected not the full of his Father's Inheritance. He accounted the Loss to be in some respects <hi>irreparable,</hi> and expected not to see so great a Prophet on all accounts', again, as E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIJAH. For so great a Loss He therefore answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly grieves and mourns, and expresses his Grief in such a remarkable manner.</p>
            <p>IN this as I observed, He is a lively <hi>Example</hi> to us â€” when eminent Ministers are taken away and we are to see them no more; for this, first to mourn in the affecting Sense of our heavy Bereavement, and then to express it in a suitable manner.â€” Not by
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:003094_0016_0000000000000000"/>
rending our Garments, as <hi>Elisha</hi> did, agreable to the Custom that then prevailed in those Parts of the World; but by such evident <hi>Symptoms,</hi> as that all about us may clearly see we are duely sensible of our great Loss and are deeply affected.</p>
            <p>SUCH as a serious, grave and solemn Look; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when we speak or hear of the Prophet departed: a Restraint for a Time from our usual Mirth: a speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the eminent Virtues and Usefulness of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased, our past Advantages in Him, our great Want of Him, and the sore Loss his Departure brings on the People He liv'd with: and if we have Tears to shed, let them gently flow.</p>
            <p>BUT above all â€” We shou'd religiously express our Sorrow to GOD; as in <hi>Humbling</hi> ourselves to the Dust under the mighty Blow of his Hand in taking them away: in <hi>Mourning</hi> bitterly for all our past Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of them, and Unfruitfulness under their lively Ministry; for all the slights we have cast upon them, the Discouragements we have at any time thrown in the way of their Work, and the Wounds and Griefs we have given their Hearts: in fine, for all the <hi>Sins</hi> whereby we have provoked the righteous GOD to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reave us of their eminent Light &amp; Labours; and for all the <hi>Prospects</hi> of those Evils we have reason to fear are coming upon us now they are taken away.</p>
            <p>AND then, Let our Sorrow brake out in most ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest <hi>Prayers</hi> for Forgiveness and sparing Mercy: that the abused SPIRIT of CHRIST may not leave us with them, but that the same plentiful measures which appeared in them, may be poured out, both on surviving Ministers and on all the People; that his Work may revive in these declining Years, and we may return to the LORD and serve Him, continue his People, and He may never forsake us.</p>
            <p>AND in order to this we shou'd also now put in Practice our</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:003094_0017_0000000000000000"/>V. and last <abbr>Obs. viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>THAT we highly value and carefully improve the Remains of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As ELIJAH ascended the Chariot, He dropped his Mantle for the Use of <hi>Elisha</hi> and others, as well as a precious Memorial of Him. And now when E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIJAH was gone out of sight, and <hi>Elisha</hi> had been rending his Cloaths in Agony, and from looking up after Him towards Heaven, came to turn his Eyes down to the Earth; How agreably may we imagin did ELIJAH'S Mantle appear before Him? How precious was the Remnant of his departed Master? How much dearer now than ever? And what cou'd He think the <hi>Mantle</hi> was left for, but as a Token of particular Favour, to support and comfort his distressed Spirit, and for his future Benefit? How gladly must He therefore see it, how soon take it up? How care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully He carries it about Him, and makes use of it in smiting and dividing the Waters?</p>
            <p>AND does not this most obviously teach us, that the <hi>Remains</hi> of eminent Ministers should be highly prized and carefully improved among us?</p>
            <p>BY their Remains I mean the excellent <hi>Writings</hi> they have left behind them. These like ELIJAH'S Mantle, were one special Means whereby they did such eminent Service while they lived: and which being consecrated to the same Design, may thro' the Grace of GOD have the same Success as well after their Departure as before.</p>
            <p>IN these Works of theirs we may yet in a great measure see them alive. There they have delivered their Souls: There they shine and burn; they breath and speak; they still express and publish their Minds; they instruct, reprove, exhort, perswade; and appear as earnest as ever to promote the Kingdom of CHRIST, to bring us into it, and to preserve and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance us in it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:003094_0018_0000000000000000"/>AND O! How moving is it to read or hear in our Houses the lively Addresses of those that are now in Eternity, and that spake as standing on the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of it? They are speaking from Heaven in the rowzing Discourses they uttered and left on Earth: And if it had been in their Power, they wou'd have continued their awakening <hi>Voice</hi> in our Ears, whenever we had a mind to hear it, as well as the printed <hi>Marks</hi> of the wounds to be seen with our Eyes. In brief, they made them Publick, that their earnest Calls might not quickly die with the noise of their Lips, but continue to move us even after they are got into the <hi>Worlds above.</hi> And it may be, <hi>There</hi> they know and rejoice in the continued Fruit of their Labours among us: and <hi>then</hi> their Joys will vastly rise as we continue to use them, and are bettered by them.</p>
            <p>AND as these works of theirs were once compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and delivered with much of the Influence of the SPIRIT of CHRIST, and it may be He breathed in them on the Hearts of the Hearers; They are still as agreable to the same gracious Agent, and if we come to peruse them with a suitable Frame of Soul, He is as likely to breath as ever. So He continually breaths in the Writings of the ancient Prophets, as much, and indeed oftentimes more than when they were at first delivered.</p>
            <p>How highly then should we value, and how care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully improve these remaining Fruits of their lively Ministry? especially seeing them so full of CHRIST and Devotion to Him, so full of ardent Love and Zeal for the Glory of GOD, and so full of Concern and Affection for the Souls of <hi>Men.</hi> In fine, so full of Light and Flame together, so full of the most useful Truths inspired in the sacred Writings, so agreable to them, and so illustrative of them.</p>
            <p>AND since we are now to see or hear these venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Men no more; how much more precious shou'd their excellent Remains be accounted than ever, and
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:003094_0019_0000000000000000"/>
how much more carefully improved among us? In fine, They are the endearing Legacies of our spiritual Fathers, Golden Talents that we are accountable for â€” By our careful Improvement, they'l secure our Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest in the same heavenly Inheritance they are gone to posses; they'l ripen us for and in due time bring us to their glorious Company: And the more we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them, the greater, when we meet in the Realms above, will be our mutual Joy.</p>
            <p>AND thus having briefly treated of the several things observed, we pass to the</p>

               </p>
               <p>THE Title we see is full both of Loveliness and Veneration. And when those of the holy Order carry it as becomes this Paternal Character, as they do when they are really eminent; how truly venerable, and yet how lovely do they appear? And when they prove like <hi>Fathers;</hi> how highly should we reverence and love them while they are with us, and with what Respect and Honour treat their Names when they are ascended to Heaven?</p>
               <p>THE Infirmities of <hi>Fathers</hi> should be reverently covered, their Persons affected, their Honour guarded, their Wants prevented, their Authority revered: their prayerful Blessings should be highly valued: their Affections, Cares, Pains and Labours liberally recompenced: And all the Reverence, Love, Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, Beneficence, and Returns of Gratitude and Justice due to our natural Fathers, are for the like Reasons owing to those who are our Fathers also in a more spiritual and exalted manner.</p>
               <p>AND shou'd the Respect of Fathers cease when they <hi>come to die,</hi> or <hi>are passed away?</hi> Noâ€”it shou'd

rather rise the higher â€” The very Prospect of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval shou'd excite our Fears, Reluctance &amp; Cries to Heaven. Their dying Groans shou'd pierce our Hearts. Their faultering Speeches shou'd have our utmost Attention. When their Light of Life expires, it should look dark &amp; solitary round about us. Their very bodily Remains should be accounted as precious Dust, and interred with Tears and Honour. They shou'd be long remembred and spoken of with te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nder affection: Their Virtues and good Actions praised, their Examples followed, their Characters preserved sacred, and their Names as perfumed oyntment poured forth with Fragrancy in every Company.</p>

               <p>THEIR Examples, Doctrines, Advices and Prayers are vast advantages <hi>apparent</hi> among us: But their <hi>invisible</hi> Influence at the Throne above, and their continual Importunities there, may draw down abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Blessings of the highest Importance, which yet may seem to come on in the Course of natural Causes. By their prevailing Intercessions with Heaven, even our most Publick Councils may be wisely guided, and our Publick Enterprizes may be happily prosper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, while we see not the secret but powerful springs from whence they proceed.</p>
               <p>WHEN they therefore depart, our Strength and Glory in a great measure go with them: and unless there are others raised up like them, we are by so much the more defenceless and exposed to Dangers.</p>
               <p>AN unhappy stop is now put to their earnest Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for us, as well as their lively Preaching to us. They can now no more watch against our dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Enemies: nor contrive, nor labour for our Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:003094_0021_0000000000000000"/>
or Safety. Their various Opportunities, their great Abilities, their Zeal for serving us, are gone from us for ever: and even their living Example that use to charm &amp; quicken us, is disappeared with them.</p>
               <p>How wide is then the Gap in our Wall of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, how weak our Strength, how thin our Glory, upon their Removal from us? and how open are we to swift Inundations of Publick Calamities!</p>
               <p n="3">3. Is it a melancholy thing to loose them and see them no more, and should their Departure be sadly resented &amp; express'd by Survivours â€” <hi>Then how much should we mourn, and express our Sorrow this Day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ONE of the greatest of <hi>Ministers</hi> is fallen in <hi>Israel:</hi> or rather ascended to the heavenly Mansions; and left us a weak, exposed and degenerate People.</p>
               <p>I may not take up your time in drawing his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Character: especially since I have had Him so much in my Heart and Eye thro' that Part of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon I have delivered already, that you could not but think I have been chiefly speaking of <hi>Him,</hi> as our Tears have shown; and it would also require a Volumn for the full Description. I shall only give you a few <hi>general Touches</hi> further, to remind us of our extraordinary Loss, and to point us to our present Duty.</p>
               <p>HE was, as you know, a Person of a wonderful <hi>quick Apprehension,</hi> tenacious Memory, lively Fancy, ready Invention, unwearied Industry: of vast Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements in Knowledge, and flaming Piety. Full of Zeal &amp; Activity for the Glory of CHRIST and the Salvation of <hi>Men.</hi> Greatly concerned for the Cause of pure &amp; vital Religion: a strenuous Asserter of Liberty both civil &amp; sacred: and of extensive Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>HE was a zealous <hi>Lover of our Churches and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi> because He saw so much of the pure scriptural sort of Religion, with the exercise of Liberty &amp; Charity
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:003094_0022_0000000000000000"/>
in them. He was always careful for them, always ready to espouse their Cause: and how much are the present and future Generations indebted, for the noble Care He has taken to preserve the <hi>Memory</hi> of the great and excellent Fathers of these religious Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>that</hi> was just a sinking into Oblivion?</p>
               <p>HE seem'd to have an inexhaustible Source of <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Flame &amp; Vigour.</hi> Nor did this brake out only in a few particular Streams of Piety, but it unboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dedly diffused it self into every Method that could be devised for the Glory of GOD and the Good of the <hi>World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HE was a wonderfull <hi>Improver of Time:</hi> and 'tis almost amazing how much He had read &amp; studied â€” How much He has wrote and published â€” How much He corresponded abroad: not only with the several Provinces in the <hi>British America,</hi> but also with <hi>England, Scotland, Ireland, Holland, Germany,</hi> and even the <hi>Eastern</hi> as well as <hi>Western Indies</hi> â€” And yet how much he conversed, visited, contrived and acted at Home! How many Languages, Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Arts and Sciences, both ancient and modern He was familiarly vers'd in â€” What a vast Amassment of <hi>Learning</hi> He had grasp'd in his Mind, from all sorts of Writings, of which He had one of the largest and richest Collections that ever was in these Ends of the Earth â€” and <hi>which</hi> He was at all times ready to use in the most sudden and <hi>extempore</hi> manner.</p>
               <p>AND yet, what was truly as admirable â€” He never seemed to be in a <hi>Hurry.</hi> He would say some good and suitable thing to every one that came to Him; and He would always entertain us with Ease &amp; Pleasure, even in his Studying Hours, as long as we pleas'd, or cou'd venture to hinder Him: making use of the most <hi>unseasonable Visitants,</hi> both to do more Good, and at the same time even advance Himself in Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; by the most artful Repetition of the more agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Passages He had lately been reading, with his own Remarks or Improvements upon them; whereby
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:003094_0023_0000000000000000"/>
He further digested them, and more perfectly made them his own.â€” Never negligent, never heavy, â€” Tho' fatigu'd in Body, never tired in Mind. <hi>To do all the Good He cou'd to all,</hi> even to the remotest Ends of the Earth â€” was his Maxim, his Study, his Labour, his Pleasure â€”and 'tis strange to consider what a vast Variety of Projects He has formed and managed for it.</p>
               <p>How lively and earnest was He in his <hi>Publick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances</hi> â€” Here we used to see his Spirits rais'd and all on Fire â€” What a couragious Enemy to all Licenciousness! What a Son of Thunder to impenitent Sinners! What a Son of Consolation to discouraged Souls! What a passionate Pleader with all to come into the Acceptance of CHRIST, and so into the Life and Favour of GOD! And what a servent Sollicitor at the Throne of Grace!</p>
               <p>AND how instructive, learned, pious and engaging was He in his <hi>private Converse</hi> â€” superior Company for the greatest of Men; condescending and gracious to the least and meanest of Children. How gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, free and courteous in his Treatment of all? How easy and natural did his vast Learning appear in every Company? In what an artful &amp; entertaining man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner would He convey the most excellent Sentiments into our Minds? How agreably temper'd with a various mixture of Wit and Chearfulness? The most knowing cou'd scarce ever leave him without knowing more, the most ungracious without some Impressions of Goodness, or any without a grateful Pleasure.</p>
               <p>I speak not now of his more <hi>retired Life,</hi> which I have a great deal of Reason to know was in an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent manner in the Mount with GOD. By this means He enjoyed a perpetual Calm: And as He constantly lived, so He died in Peaceâ€” and no doubt is ascended to those heavenly Places where He delighted to converse every Day.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="unknown:003094_0024_0000000000000000"/>SCARCE any on Earth have gone thro' such a great Variety and constant Succession of extraordinary <hi>Tryals.</hi> But in these He lived a continual Sacrifice; and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved them, not to dishearten, but quicken Him to bring forth more Glory to GOD, and to be more useful to <hi>Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HE was in many respects like the ancient ELIJAH. And wherein He was tho't to be faulty â€” It was also much like Him, in a super-abounding Zeal for the Cause of GOD and <hi>his People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE Care of the <hi>Churches</hi> both in this and the Provinces round about, has for many Years lain chiefly upon Him: as He has been long a Father to the Ministers in then, and to Him they repair'd in their difficult Cases for Light and Direction.</p>
               <p>AND O how happy have been the <hi>Pastors of this great Town</hi> in having Him at our Head â€” who was ever as diffusive as full of all kinds of Knowledge and Wisdom â€” scarce ever at a Loss in any Emergence â€” ready to find out Expedients in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult Cases; to solve the most perplex'd on a sudden; and in a few Minutes time, even while we were talking, to draw up, on his Knee, the State of the Controverly with proper Advices, in an accurate manner. And as we sat at his Feet as Children; his Speech dropped upon us, and we waited for Him as for the Rain, as the thirsty Earth for the Rain of Heaven.</p>
               <p>AND now, like <hi>Elisha</hi> and the other <hi>Sons of the Prophets,</hi> we must see our <hi>Master</hi> taken away from our Head, and must see Him no more! How dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal does the Sound now enter our Ears â€” Dr. MATHER <hi>is gone,</hi> He is now no more among us, who has been so long an eminent Part of our Light and Glory! He shall return no more to his House, and the Places of his Studying, Conversing &amp; Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing shall know Him no more!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="unknown:003094_0025_0000000000000000"/>FOR <hi>my self,</hi> I must always account the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Intimacy He was pleased to favour me with, as one of the richest Blessings of all my Life. And I can't but reflect with the deepest Regret on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Advantages I have carelesly lost, thro' a fond Expectation of his continuing longer. Especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when there was lodg'd in his Mind a great Treasure of secret and curious <hi>History,</hi> both of <hi>New</hi> ENGLAND and <hi>Old,</hi> from the Beginning of the Reign of King CHARLES I, to this Day: which He had strangely gotten from the ancient Fathers of these Plantations who were living in his Younger times, from our successive Agents and other Intelligent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons who have come over hither for this <hi>Fifty</hi> Years, and from his vast Correspondence both at Home and Abroad: But is now irrecoverably vanished with Him.</p>
               <p>THIS is Part of the extraordinary Man that is now gone from us. And <q>how does <hi>the City,</hi> tho' full of People, sit sad and solitary! How is she become as a Widow! She that is great among the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Princess among the Provinces! Her Priests sigh, her Virgins are afflicted, and she is in Bitterness! For the LORD hath afflicted Her for the multitude of her Transgressions; and from the Daughter of <hi>Zion</hi> her Beauty is passed away! She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members in the time of her Sorrows her pleasant Things that she had in the Days of old under his flaming Ministry. But now the LORD has made Her desolate â€” He has made Her Strength to fall â€” For these things I weep, mine Eye, mine Eye runs down with Water â€” What shall I equal to Thee that I may comfort Thee, O virgin Daughter of <hi>Zion?</hi> For thy Breach is great like the Sea: who can heal Thee? And if we look to the <hi>Land;</hi> Behold Darkness and Sorrow, and the Light is darkned in the Heavens thereof!</q>
               </p>
               <p>BUT,</p>
               <p n="4">4. and lastly, SHOULD the <hi>Remains</hi> of our eminent Ministers be highly prized &amp; carefully improved by usâ€”
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:003094_0026_0000000000000000"/>
                  <hi>Then here we see both our present Advantage and incumbent Duty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THO' they are gone out of sight, yet they have left their <hi>Mantles,</hi> their excellent <hi>Writings;</hi> which by our due Improvement, may, thro' the Blessing of GOD, be as useful among us as ever. By these they continue to bare their Testimony against the Vices and Follies of Men: They continue to warn us of the destructive Ways of Sin, and to bare their Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to the Wisdom and Happiness of being truly Religious.</p>
               <p>AND if now they were suffered to call out of Heaven, as with the Voice of an <hi>Angel</hi> and the <hi>Trump of</hi> GOD; what a great Noise would they make in our Air, and how surprizingly alarm the World with meerly the loud Repetition of what they have Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished to excite and awaken us? And do the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses they have left behind them only want this mighty Sound, this forcible Motion of the Air about us, to pierce our Ears and reach our Hearts and convert us to God? Are they not in themselves as <hi>suitable</hi> to work on our rational Powers without it; To convince us of the miserable State we are in by Nature, of the dreadful and imminent Danger of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in it, and of the absolute need of hastening to CHRIST, that we may be certainly saved &amp; happy for ever?â€”Surely Yes.</p>
               <p>How great is then the Advantage of having these <hi>Remains</hi> of theirs? And how should we continue to Read them, that our Souls may live; as others have been happily made alive to GOD at the Hearing of them?</p>
               <p>AND on this Account, how rich is our Privilege, in the numerous and excellent <hi>Writings of that emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent person</hi> the Loss of whom we bewail this Day.</p>
               <p>IN his <hi>Style</hi> indeed He was something singular, and not so agreable to the Gust of the Age. But like his <hi>manner of speaking,</hi> it was very <hi>emphatical:</hi> And in all his Composures on Divinity Subjects â€” with a mixture of various Learning, we clearly see
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:003094_0027_0000000000000000"/>
the Beauty and Life of Religion, in the strongest Colours. The vital Actings of the Grace of CHRIST inspired into the Souls of Men, and the manner of Turning and Living to GOD, were the continued Theme of his Preaching, Conversing and Writingâ€” as a lively Expression of what He felt in his Heart, as the only Principle of immortal Happiness, and the most likely means to kindle the same Flame in others. And He delighted to carry us to the Hights of Piety.</p>
               <p>HE had also a constant Eye to the <hi>inspired Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings</hi> in all his own. He kept closely to them as the Light of his Feet; and has made it a principal Part of his Life to clear and urge them.</p>
               <p>AND here I cannot forbear expressing my most ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Wishes that <hi>That</hi> admirable Labour of his, The AMERICAN BIBLE, might soon appear in Publick to enlighten the World. An extraordinary Work, that his Heart has been set on from his early Days, and has taken Him up almost <hi>Fifty Years</hi> to compose. And as scarce any has run thro' a greater number of Volumns, or could do it with a greater Swiftness; He has almost continually done it with a particular View to illustrate the sacred <hi>Oracles.</hi> He has made all sorts of Authors to conspire to this: If He met with any in the <hi>Catalogues</hi> either in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Holland,</hi> that He imagin'd might help the Design; He would not rest till He had obtained it: And He has scarce left a curious Passage in any Writing of Fame, whether ancient or modern, that has cast a Light on any Part of the Scriptures, but He has put in it's Place in this most rich Collection. And to these He has added his own Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements from his intimate Knowledge of the <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal</hi> Tongues, of the most learned <hi>Lexicons,</hi> and the ancient Customs &amp; Histories of the <hi>Eastern</hi> Nations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>BUT I must draw to a Close.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND now what shall we do; but first <hi>admire</hi> and <hi>praise</hi> the boundless Grace of GOD, that has given such excellent Virtues to Men; and then <hi>bewail</hi> our Sins which have made this Earth unworthy of them;
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:003094_0028_0000000000000000"/>
and have provok'd <hi>the most High</hi> to remove so <hi>great a Light</hi> so early from us, while He continued to shine in his Strength, and near a <hi>Score</hi> of Years before He could come to the Age of his Fathers.</p>
               <p>AND upon his Rapture from us, shall we not now <hi>look upwards</hi> after Him thro' Hosts of Angels to the Worlds above? Where all his Hope is turn'd to Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and all his Faith to the open Vision of <hi>that wonderful Person,</hi> whom He was forever admiring when He was here on Earth, &amp; commending to others. And how shall we come to <hi>secure our future Ascention</hi> to the same heavenly Places; but by observing his Councils and imitating his bright Example? Who thro' Faith and Patience is gone before us to inherit the Promises. And what shall we do for <hi>Power</hi> to follow Him thither, but earnestly cry to the GOD of all Grace that He would fill us with his lively SPIRIT, uphold us with his mighty Hand, and conduct us by his perfect Council, till He raises us to the <hi>same Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND O! <hi>There,</hi> let us in the mean while extend our reaching Views! Thereâ€”where GOD appears thro' CHRIST in all his Glory to his People! In HIM the GODHEAD shines and shows Himself in that World of Light: and There let us earnestly &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually seek &amp; long to behold and enjoy Him! There his People shall most openly &amp; clearly view his Divine Perfections, his wise Designs, his wondrous Works, and the Smiles of his Face full shining on them! As they are ascending thither, they shall feel themselves <hi>Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming</hi> in a wonderful manner; And when they enter his Presence, to their great Amazement, they shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be like Him; they shall see themselves to be most agreable to Him; and there they shall enjoy a most delightful Complacency in each other for ever! <hi>O astonishing Happiness! beyond our Conception, above our Wonder! That GOD alone can fully comprehend, and that will take up Eternal Ages for both</hi> Men <hi>and</hi> Angels <hi>to express &amp; admire!</hi>
