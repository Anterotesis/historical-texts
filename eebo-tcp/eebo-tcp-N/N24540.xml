            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IT will, perhaps, be asked, why the detail of common place observations and arguments which the following Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course presents, was thought necessary at the present day, on a subject so well understood, and concerning which there is so little variety of opinion among enlightened men?—To this question it may be answered, that this Discourse being the first that was delivered, in consequence of a late deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Society to institute an Annual Oration, it was thought pardonable, and even proper, to begin with an <hi>elementary</hi> view of the subject—that the subject of slavery, however familiarly understood by a few benevolent indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals among us, has been but little attended to by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of our citizens; and that, strange as it may seem, the objections and principles which the Author combats are daily advanced, with confidence, by many with whom he converses.</p>

            <p>IN meeting you on this occaſion, I am deeply impreſſed with circumſtances which demand the warmeſt congratulations. We cannot ſurvey the preſent condition of the civilized world, without forming a contraſt, at once pleaſing and melancholy, between our peaceful and happy ſituation, and the convulſed and diſtracted ſtate of thoſe countries with which we are moſt nearly connected. No in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidious feelings—no inſenſibility to the calamities of others, will be ſuppoſed to ſuggeſt this compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon. It is forced upon us by a conjuncture in human affairs ſo extraordinary and intereſting, that no one can be inattentive to it—ſo gloomy and dark, that none can calculate the danger, or ſee the end.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:032477_0006_0FF285DDA01CDEF8"/>
At this aera, momentous at preſent, but ſtill more pregnant with the future, the voice of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, alas! is but too ſeldom heard. Perſecuted and chaſed from almoſt every corner of the globe, ſhe knows not where to find an aſylum. The ſtruggles of Ambition, graſping and devouring every thing within his reach; and the deſolations of War, widely ſpread, and murderous beyond former example, exhibit the prominent features of Europe, and engroſs, almoſt excluſively, the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the paſſing hour. Europe, more highly favoured and cultivated than the reſt of the world, and regarding the other quarters of the globe with a faſtidious ſuperiority, is become as pre-eminent in crimes, as in opulence, refinement, and power. She offers few examples, but thoſe of rapine and violence—little intercourſe, but ſuch as is calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to corrupt and deſtroy.</p>
            <p>From ſcenes equally affecting to our view, and deſtructive to human happineſs, let us turn away our eyes, and fix them on the means of promoting the welfare and improvement of our own country. Among theſe, there is one object which pathetically invites our attention. The inſtitution of the SOCIETY which I have now the honour to addreſs, and the occaſion of the preſent meeting, deſignate this object. The importance of it can eſcape the obſervation of none. For, however juſtly we may prize the comparative felicity of our country; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:032477_0007_0FF285DF4452C408"/>
juſtly we may exult in the excellence of our Conſtitution, and the humanity of our laws; we are forbidden to be idle, while a ſingle ſource of human miſery, admitting of relief, remains to tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh our character.</p>
            <p>That, in the cloſe of the eighteenth century, it ſhould be eſteemed proper and neceſſary, in any civilized country, to inſtitute diſcourſes to oppoſe the ſlavery and commerce of the human ſpecies, is a wonderful fact in the annals of ſociety! But that this country ſhould be America, is a ſoleciſm only to be accounted for by the general inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of the human character. But, after all the ſurpriſe that Patriotiſm can feel, and all the Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation that Morality can ſuggeſt on this ſubject, the humiliating tale muſt be told—that in this free country—in this country, the plains of which are ſtill ſtained with blood ſhed in the cauſe of liberty,—in this country, from which has been proclaimed to diſtant lands, as the baſis of our political exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the noble principle, that "ALL MEN ARE BORN FREE AND EQUAL,"—in this country there are ſlaves!—men are bought and ſold! Strange, indeed! that the boſom which glows at the name of liberty in general, and the arm which has been ſo vigorouſly exerted in vindication of human rights, ſhould yet be found leagued on the ſide of oppreſſion, and oppoſing their avowed prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:032477_0008_0FF285E3FB75CD40"/>
Much, indeed, has been done by many benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent individuals and ſocieties, to aboliſh this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful practice, and to improve the condition of thoſe unhappy people, whom the ignorance or the avarice of our anceſtors has bequeathed to us as ſlaves. Still, however, notwithſtanding all the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and eloquence which have been directed againſt it, the evil continues; ſtill laws and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices exiſt, which loudly call for reform; ſtill MORE THAN HALF A MILLION of our fellow creatures in the United States are deprived of that which, next to life, is the deareſt birth-right of man.</p>
            <p>To deliver the plain dictates of humanity, juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, religion, and good policy, on this ſubject, is the deſign of the preſent diſcourſe. In doing this, it will not be expected that any thing new ſhould be offered. It is not a new ſubject; and every point of view in which it can be conſidered has been long ſince rendered familiar by the ingenious and the humane. All that is left for me is, to bring to your remembrance principles which, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever well known, cannot be too often repeated; and to exhibit ſome of the moſt obvious arguments againſt an evil which, though generally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, is ſtill practically perſiſted in.</p>
            <p>And here I ſhall paſs over in ſilence the unnum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered cruelties, and the violations of every natural and ſocial tie, which mark the African trade, and
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:032477_0009_0FF285E8668E9718"/>
which attend the injured captives in dragging them from their native ſhores, and from all the attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of life. I ſhall not call you to contemplate the miſeries and hardſhips which follow them into ſervitude, and render their life a cup of unmingled bitterneſs. Unwilling to wound your feelings, or my own, by the melancholy recital, over theſe ſcenes I would willingly draw a veil; and confine myſelf to principles and views of the ſubject more immediately applicable to ourſelves.</p>
            <p>That enſlaving, or continuing to hold in ſlavery, thoſe who have forfeited their liberty by no crime, is contrary to the dictates both of juſtice and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, I truſt few who hear me will be diſpoſed to deny. However the judgment of ſome may be biaſſed by the ſuppoſed peculiarity of certain caſes, I preſume that, with regard to the abſtract prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, there can be but one opinion among en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened and candid minds. What is the end of all ſocial connection but the advancement of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man happineſs? And what can be a more plain and indiſputable principle of republican govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than that all the right which ſociety poſſeſs over individuals, or one man over another, muſt be founded either upon contract, expreſs or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, or upon forfeiture by crime? But, are the Africans and their deſcendants enſlaved upon either of theſe principles? Have they voluntarily ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendered their liberty to their whiter brethren? Or
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:032477_0010_0FF285EA1A155E40"/>
have they forfeited their natural right to it by the violation of any law? Neither of theſe is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the moſt zealous advocates for ſlavery. By what ties, then, are they held in ſervitude? By the ties of force and injuſtice only; by ties which are equally oppoſed to the reaſon of things, and to the fundamental principles of all legitimate aſſociation.</p>
            <p>In the preſent age and country, none, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will reſt a defence of ſlavery on the ground of ſuperior force; the right of captivity; or any ſimilar principle, which the ignorance and the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocity of ancient times admitted as a juſtifiable tenure of property. It is to be hoped the time is paſſed, never more to return, when men would recognize maxims as ſubverſive of morality as they are of ſocial happineſs. Can the laws and rights of war be properly drawn into precedent for the imitation of ſober and regular government? Can we ſanction the deteſtable idea, that liberty is only an advantage gained by ſtrength, and not a right derived from nature's God? Such ſentiments become the abodes of demons, rather than ſocieties of civilized men.</p>
            <p>Pride, indeed, may contend, that theſe unhappy ſubjects of our oppreſſion are an <hi>inferior race of beings;</hi> and are therefore aſſigned by the ſtricteſt juſtice to a depreſſed and ſervile ſtation in ſociety. But in what does this inferiority conſiſt? In a
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:032477_0011_0FF285F147E0EC08"/>
difference of <hi>complexion</hi> and <hi>figure?</hi> Let the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and illiberal mind, who can advance ſuch an argument, recollect whither it will carry him. In traverſing the various regions of the earth, from the Equator to the Pole, we find an infinite diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of ſhades in the complexion of men, from the darkeſt to the faireſt hues. If, then, the proper ſtation of the African is that of ſervitude and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, we muſt alſo contend, that every Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe and Spaniard is, though in a leſs degree, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to us, and ſhould be ſubject to a meaſure of the ſame degradation. Nay, if the tints of colour be conſidered the teſt of human dignity, we may juſtly aſſume a haughty ſuperiority over our ſouthern brethren of this continent, and deviſe their ſubju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. In ſhort, upon this principle, where ſhall liberty end? or where ſhall ſlavery begin? At what grade is it that the ties of blood are to ceaſe? And how many ſhades muſt we deſcend ſtill lower in the ſcale, before mercy is to vaniſh with them?</p>
            <p>But, perhaps, it will be ſuggeſted, that the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans and their deſcendants are inferior to their whiter brethren in <hi>intellectual capacity,</hi> if not in complexion and figure. This is ſtrongly aſſerted, but upon what ground? Becauſe we do not ſee men who labour under every diſadvantage, and who have every opening faculty blaſted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by their depreſſed condition, ſignalize themſelves as philoſophers? Becauſe we do not find
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:032477_0012_0FF285F54D18C880"/>
men who are almoſt entirely cut off from every ſource of mental improvement, riſing to literary honours? To ſuppoſe the Africans of an inferior radical character, becauſe they have not thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed themſelves, is juſt as rational as to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe every private citizen of an inferior ſpecies, who has not raiſed himſelf to the condition of royalty. But, the truth is, many of the negroes diſcover great ingenuity, notwithſtanding their circumſtances are ſo depreſſed, and ſo unfavourable to all cultivation.

            <p>ARISTOTLE long ago ſaid—<q>Men of little genius, and great bodily ſtrength, are by nature deſtined to ſerve, and thoſe of a better capacity to command.

            <p>Again—Avarice may clamorouſly contend, that the <hi>laws of property</hi> juſtify ſlavery; and that every one has an undoubted right to whatever has been obtained by <hi>fair purchaſe</hi> or <hi>regular deſcent.</hi> To this demand the anſwer is plain. The right which every man has to his perſonal liberty is paramount to all the laws of property. The right which every one has to <hi>himſelf</hi> infinitely tranſcends all other human tenures. Of conſequence, the latter can never be ſet in oppoſition to the former. I do not mean, at preſent, to decide the queſtion, whether the poſſeſſors of ſlaves, when called upon by public authority to manumit them, ſhould be indemnified for the loſs they ſuſtain. This is a ſeparate queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and muſt be decided by a different tribunal from that before which I bring the general ſubject. All I contend for at preſent is, that no claims of property can ever juſtly interfere with, or be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered

to impede the operation of that noble and eternal principle, that <q>all men are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights—and that among theſe are life, liberty, and the purſuit of happineſs.</q>

            <p>Theſe principles and remarks would doubtleſs appear ſelf-evident to all, were the caſe of the unhappy Africans for a moment made our own. Were it made a queſtion, whether juſtice per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the ſable race of Guinea to carry us away captive from our own country, and from all its tender attachments, to their own land, and there enſlave us and our poſterity for ever;—were it made a queſtion, I ſay, whether all this would be conſiſtent with juſtice and humanity, one univerſal and clamorous negative would ſhow how abhorrent the principle is from our minds, when not blinded by prejudice. Tell us, ye who were lately pining in ALGERINE BONDAGE! tell us whether all the wretched ſophiſtry of pride, or of avarice, could ever reconcile you to the chains of barbarians, or convince you that man had a right to oppreſs and injure man? Tell us what were your feelings, when you heard the pityleſs tyrant, who had taken or bought you, plead either of theſe rights for your detention; and juſtify himſelf by the ſpecious pretences of capture or of purchaſe, in riveting your chains?</p>

Let none ſay, that, notwithſtanding all theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings, the ſlaves are <hi>happier</hi> in a ſtate of ſervitude, than they would be if ſet at liberty, eſpecially when they are treated with lenity, and provided for in a comfortable manner. That there are different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of wretchedneſs among them, in different cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, no one can doubt: and when they fall into the hands of the humane and kind, their depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is leſs—far leſs miſerable, than when the torture of whips, the pains of hunger and nakedneſs, and the unreaſonable impoſitions of hard taſk-maſters, are added to ſervitude. On this account, I am happy in being able to ſay, that the lot of ſlaves among us is, in general, much more tolerable than that of thoſe in ſome other parts even of our own country. But ſtill they are both in bondage. However favoured the ſituation of either, they are both deprived of that bleſſing, in poſſeſſion of which the barren rock has its joys, and without which Eden itſelf would be a gloomy ſcene. After all the ſordid pleas of thoſe who would meaſure out enjoyment for them, they are forced to ſubmit to an evil which, <q>how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever diſguiſed, is a bitter draught, and ever will be ſo till Nature herſelf ſhall change.</q>

            <p>But higher laws than thoſe of common juſtice and humanity may be urged againſt ſlavery. I mean THE LAWS OF GOD, revealed in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of truth. This divine ſyſtem, in which we profeſs to believe and to glory, teaches us, that

               <hi>God has made of one blood all nations of men tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

It teaches us, that we ſhould do to all men whatever we, in like circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, would that they ſhould do unto us. It teaches us, in a word, that love to man, and a conſtant purſuit of human happineſs, is the ſum of all ſocial duty.—Principles theſe, which wage eternal war both with political and domeſtic ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry—Principles which forbid every ſpecies of domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, excepting that which is founded on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or which the welfare of ſociety requires.</p>
            <p>There have not been wanting, indeed, men as ignorant as they were impious, who have appealed to the ſacred ſcriptures for a defence of ſlavery. They have dared to ſeek for a juſtification of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries and oppreſſion in a volume, which teaches nothing but <hi>peace on earth, and good will towards men.</hi> As a ſpecimen of their reaſoning—Some have contended, <q>that the Africans are the poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of HAM, one of the ſons of NOAH; that, as it was declared by divine inſpiration, that his deſcendants ſhould be ſervants to their brethren, ſo reducing them to a ſtate of ſlavery is only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing the will of heaven.</q>—But this plea can never be maintained, either upon the ground
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:032477_0017_0FF28611611C0748"/>
of <hi>fact,</hi> or of <hi>ſober principle.</hi> The curſe pronounced upon HAM was evidently a limited one, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended only to a part of his poſterity. It was only ſaid, that the deſcendants of CANAAN, one of the four ſons of HAM, ſhould ſerve the poſterity of SHEM and JAPHET. This curſe, then, had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with the African nations, who have been ſo much abuſed by the civilized world; but was partly fulfilled, when the deſcendants of CA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAAN in PALESTINE became <hi>hewers of wood and drawers of water</hi> to the ISRAELITES, who were the deſcendants of SHEM: and afterwards was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely accompliſhed, when the CARTHAGINIANS and TYRIANS were ſubdued by SCIPIO and ALEXANDER.<note n="*" place="bottom">See STACKHOUSE'S History of the Bible, vol. i. p. 268, 269.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But, admitting the curſe pronounced upon HAM to have all the meaning and extenſion which the advocates for ſlavery contend; yet we are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it was <hi>prophetical</hi> in its nature; and though infinite Wiſdom deſigned to fulfil it, ſtill it is plain, the agents in bringing about the fulfilment cannot be conſidered the leſs criminal on this account. It was propheſied, that the SAVIOUR OF THE WORLD ſhould be crucified, long before that important event took place; and yet, I preſume, none ever ſuppoſed that this conſideration exculpated his murderers. The truth is, if our being made inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

of accompliſhing the deſigns of heaven takes away guilt, there is no ſuch thing as crime in the world; the moſt execrable cruelty that ever diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced mankind muſt be pronounced right; and the work of carnage and death, in every age, muſt receive the benediction of the wiſe and the good!</p>
            <p>The practice of the JEWS, the choſen people of God, has alſo been ſuppoſed, by ſome, to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh a precedent which we might lawfully follow. That the children of Iſrael had the permiſſion of God to purchaſe bondmen and bondwomen of the heathen nations which were round about them, and even to retain ſome of their own people in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude, for a limited time, is readily granted. But this permiſſion appears to have been particularly deſigned for that people, and was not extended to the reſt of mankind. It ſtands on the ſame ground with many other things, which they were permitted to do, on account of their ſeparation from the reſt of the world, and on account of the comparatively ſervile nature of their diſpenſation; but in which it would be extremely criminal for us to imitate them. As well might the midnight murderer plead, as an apology for his crime, that God's cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen people were once ordered to deſtroy the guilty heathen who inhabited the promiſed land. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, if this permiſſion, given to the children of Iſrael, on a ſpecial occaſion, and for wiſe purpoſes, be conſidered as extending to all ſucceeding times

and people, where ſhall its operation begin? and where ſhall it end? If this principle be admitted, then every nation on earth is at liberty to purchaſe and enſlave the citizens of every other. If this be the caſe, we have a right to make merchandize of our white brethren in Europe, if any can be found ſo baſe as to ſeize and ſell them to us; and they, on the other hand, have a like privilege to inſtitute a trade in the fleſh of AMERICAN FREEMEN!—Will any ſay, that this is a forced concluſion? No—though juſtice, humanity, and religion all riſe up againſt it, it naturally flows from the principle above ſtated, and is quite as tenable in every point of view.</p>
            <p>But farther—the writings of the Apoſtles, it ſeems, have been thought by ſome to furniſh a warrant for ſlavery. In one of the Epiſtles we find theſe words—<hi>Let as many ſervants as are under the yoke, count their maſters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blaſphemed. And let them who have believing maſters not deſpiſe them, becauſe they are brethren, but rather do them ſervice.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Tim. vi. 2.</note> Now, even taking for granted what, perhaps, may reaſonably be called in queſtion, that the perſons referred to in this paſſage were ſlaves <hi>for life,</hi> and under <hi>involuntary</hi> ſervitude—ſtill it furniſhes no ſuch argument as many imagine. It muſt be remembered, that the great Author of our
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:032477_0020_0FF28619C3D022A0"/>
religion did not think proper directly to interfere with the political arrangements, and the civil laws, which were eſtabliſhed when his Goſpel was firſt preached among men. He always rather inculcated ſubmiſſion, and patience under the moſt oppreſſive injuries. This doctrine the Apoſtle applies, in the preſent inſtance, to a particular claſs of perſons, to whom he thought the admonition neceſſary; and all that he intends to inculcate on ſuch is, that, during the continuance of their ſervitude, (the origin, nature, or duration of which does not appear) they ſhould faithfully perform their duty to their maſters, and patiently ſubmit to their lot. But, does this precept juſtify thoſe who hold their fellow creatures in illegal and forcible ſubjection? By no means—No more than the precepts, <hi>Reſiſt not evil;</hi> and, <hi>If any man ſmite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other alſo,</hi> juſtify the evil and the abuſe which they forbid us to reſiſt—No more than the precept, <hi>Let every man be ſubject to the powers that be,</hi> can be conſtrued into a juſtification of the cruelty and deſpotiſm which, in thoſe days, and ever ſince, rulers have exerciſed over their ſubjects.</p>
            <p>But, though it be granted that Chriſt and his Apoſtles, for the reaſon which has been juſt aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, did not in ſo many words prohibit the practice of ſlavery; it is evident they taught principles and doctrines utterly abhorrent from ſuch a practice. And they who imbibe the true ſpirit of their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:032477_0021_0FF2861DAFB0FFE8"/>
will not heſitate a moment to pronounce, that invading the liberty and diminiſhing the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of a fellow creature, are directly oppoſite to the benign genius of Chriſtianity. Hence it is a remarkable and well known fact, that, after the introduction of this religion into the ROMAN EM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PIRE, every ſucceſſive law that was made relating to ſlaves, was more and more in their favour, abat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the rigours of ſervitude, until, at laſt, all the ſubjects of the empire were declared equally free. Nay, a celebrated hiſtorian has not ſcrupled to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for the degree of liberty which is at preſent enjoyed, throughout moſt parts of Europe, by the mild and benevolent influence of a ſyſtem, the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form tendency of which is, to <hi>let the oppreſſed go free, and to break every yoke.</hi>

For the ſake of ſuch, therefore, I add, with the utmoſt confidence, that ſlavery is not more oppoſed to juſtice, humanity, and religion, than it is to the INTEREST of individuals, and to the TRUE PO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LICY and HAPPINESS of that ſociety in which it is ſuffered to exiſt.</p>
            <p>Slavery will always be found, in proportion to
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:032477_0022_0FF2861F50811CE8"/>
the extent and ſeverity with which it prevails, to INJURE THE MORALS of a people. That it tends to produce, on the one hand, haughtineſs, a ſpirit of domination, cruelty, and lewdneſs, among the whites, appears probable, upon the ſlighteſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the ſubject, and is abundantly proved by experience. And, on the other hand, that it has an equal tendency, to produce and cheriſh al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every ſpecies of vice, among the ſlaves them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, none, I preſume, will heſitate to admit. Should any have a remaining doubt whether this be the caſe, let them compare the ſtate of morals in thoſe parts of our own country, in which ſlavery is either unknown, or exiſts in the moſt lenient form, with that which is exhibited in thoſe ſtates in which ſlaves are more numerous and more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded. That there is a ſenſible difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the moral aſpect of the one and the other, no one will controvert. That the compariſon fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes a reſult unfavourable to the latter, the moſt decided partiality for them can neither conceal nor deny. And that this difference of national and moral character depends, to ſay the leaſt, in ſome degree, on the ſtate of ſlavery in each reſpectively, I believe the moſt accurate and candid obſervers have readily granted.<note n="*" place="bottom">It is scarcely necessary to say, that no <hi>reflection</hi> on the Southern States is here intended.

In this State, as well as in moſt others in the union, the teſtimony of a ſlave cannot be admitted in judicial proceſs, excepting in a few caſes. What is the ground of this law? The anſwer is obvious,—"SLAVERY DEBASES THE MIND, AND COR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RUPTS THE MORAL CHARACTER." The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy victims of oppreſſion, feeling themſelves precluded by violence, from enjoying the benefits of ſociety, neglect the ſocial virtues. Finding their own rights habitually invaded, they ſoon learn to diſregard the rights of others.

Nor has ſlavery a more miſchievous effect on the morals of ſociety, than it has on NATIONAL INDUSTRY, POPULATION, AND GENERAL IM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PROVEMENT.

In this part of the United States, indeed, the pernicious effects of ſlavery are diſplayed in a comparatively moderate degree. But even in our own State they are diſtinctly perceptible. Even here we ſhould be a happier and a wealthier people, were every labourer a freeman, and, of conſequence, the product of every man's labour his own property.—Would to God, however, there were not ſome of our SISTER REPUBLICS, whoſe ſituation is more perilous, and whoſe proſpects are more gloomy!

            <p>Many have been the propoſals of benevolent men to remedy this grand evil, and to ameliorate the condition of the injured negroes.

Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to emancipate <hi>ſeven hundred thouſand</hi> ſlaves, and ſend them forth into ſociety, with all the ignorance, habits, and vices of their degraded education about them, would probably produce effects more unhappy than any one is able to calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late or conceive.

I ſhall not ſay, that ſuch a removal would be leſs happy

for the ſubjects of it, than their preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; becauſe, in particular inſtances, it might prove otherwiſe. But, in my view, the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and objections attending ſuch a plan, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially on a large ſcale, are far greater and more numerous than many ſanguine ſpeculators have ſeemed to ſuppoſe.</p>
            <p>Perhaps no method can be deviſed, to deliver our country from the evil in queſtion, more ſafe, more promiſing, and more eaſy of execution, than one which has been partially adopted in ſome of the ſtates, and hitherto with all the ſucceſs that could have been expected. This plan is, to frame laws, which will bring about emancipation in a GRADUAL MANNER; which will, at the ſame time, PROVIDE FOR THE INTELLECTUAL AND MORAL CULTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VATION of ſlaves, that they may be prepared to exerciſe the rights, and diſcharge the duties of citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, when liberty ſhall be given them; and which, having thus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>itted them for the ſtation, will confer upon them, in due time, the privileges and dignity of other freemen. By the operation of ſuch a plan, it is eaſy to ſee that ſlavery, at no great diſtance of time, would be baniſhed from the United States; the miſchiefs attending an univerſal and immediate emancipation would be, in a great meaſure, if not entirely, prevented; and beings, who are now gnawing the vitals, and waſting the ſtrength of the body politic, might be converted into wholeſome

and uſeful members of it. Say not that they are unfit for the rank of citizens, and can never be made honeſt and induſtrious members of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity. Say not that their ignorance and bruta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity muſt operate as everlaſting bars againſt their being elevated to this ſtation. All juſt reaſoning abjures the flimſy pretext. Make them freemen; and they will ſoon be found to have the manners, the character, and the virtues of freemen.<note n="*" place="bottom">It is easy to foresee that many strong prejudices, and many feelings not altogether unnatural, will oppose the execution of this plan. The idea of admitting negroes to a state of political and social equality with the whites, even after the best education they can receive, is not a very pleasant one to a great majority even of those who are warmly engaged for their emancipation. I shall not discuss the reasonableness of such feelings at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. It is sufficient to say, that our political body is labouring under a most hurtful and dangerous disease; and that the most skilful physician cannot restore it to health without the exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of some remedies which are more or less unpalatable.</note>

            <p>In two of our ſiſter States, the important work of which I am ſpeaking is already, in a great meaſure, atchieved. In MASSACHUSETTS and NEW-HAMPSHIRE there is not a ſingle ſlave! In both they were all emancipated in a ſingle day; and no inconvenience reſulted from an event ſo honourable to humanity. Noble example! Happy triumph of truth and juſtice over a miſtaken and ſordid policy! When ſhall a ſimilar wiſdom pervade the union, and reſcue our national character from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace?

            <p>In the purſuit of this laudable and important object, you, my fellow citizens of the SOCIETY whom I now addreſs, need no exhortations of mine to inſpire you with zeal—no hints from me to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect your exertions. Your labours have been ſo indefatigable and ſucceſsful, that I have only to repeat the injunction of holy writ,—<hi>Be not weary in well doing.</hi> To tell this audience, that you have no wiſh to oppoſe the laws of your country, nor to invade the rights of private property—To ſay, that you have no deſire to excite a ſpirit of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content and inſolence among thoſe whom the public will, however miſtaken, has devoted to ſlavery—To ſay, that your only objects, as a Society, are, to reſcue thoſe who are <hi>unlawfully</hi> held in bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; to promote, by all juſt means, ſuch a gradual manumiſſion, as ſhall be conſiſtent with the public good; and to cultivate a ſpirit of ſobriety, honeſty, and good behaviour among the negroes of every deſcription—To ſay that theſe are your only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, would be condeſcending to obviate prejudices, and to repel calumnies, which, as I am perſuaded they have no juſt ground, are entitled to but little attention;—prejudices and calumnies, to which the tenor of your proceedings, if examined, will furniſh an abundant and honourable anſwer.</p>

But, amidſt all the oppoſition which you are called to encounter, in purſuing the objects of your aſſociation, you have grounds of encouragement and ſupport of the moſt ſubſtantial kind. The good effects of your benevolent exertions are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready great and extenſive. You cannot look back, without the higheſt pleaſure, on the hundreds, unlawfully held in ſervitude, whoſe chains you have broken, and whom you have elevated, in ſome meaſure, to the rank of men. You cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template, without ſatisfaction, the perceptible and happy influence which your proceedings have had, in impreſſing the rude minds of the Africans, in general, among us; in giving them ſome ideas of the importance of their moral conduct; and in leading many of them to ſober and induſtrious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits.—And above all, it muſt reward your paſt labours, and animate your future exertions, to behold a SEMINARY FOR THE EDUCATION OF THE DESCENDANTS OF AFRICANS, grown up under your foſtering care, to a reſpectability which promiſes extenſive uſefulneſs, and which demands the gratitude and ſupport of every good citizen.<note n="*" place="bottom">The African School above referred to, was founded in the month of November, 1787. It began with <hi>twelve</hi> scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. Since that time, it has been gradually improving in every respect. It is under the immediate care and inspection of a board of Trustees. It is provided with a Master, Usher, and Mistress, by whom the pupils are taught Reading, Penman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, Arithmetic, English Grammar, and Geography; and, in addition to these, the female scholars are instructed in Needle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work. The number of scholars, on the first of January, 1797, was <hi>one hundred and twenty-two;</hi> of whom <hi>sixty-three</hi> were males, and <hi>fifty-nine</hi> females. The good behaviour, and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able character of these scholars, have been before noticed. This institution is supported at the annual expence of <hi>one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand dollars;</hi> and, of course, employs nearly the whole of the funds of the Society. The benevolent, of every description, will readily perceive, and deeply feel the strong claim which it presents for their support and encouragement.</note>

Go on, then, my Friends and Colleagues, with unabating zeal. You are engaged in the cauſe of human happineſs, and, therefore, in the cauſe of God. Be not diſcouraged by the magnitude of the evil which you have aſſociated to encounter; nor by the difficulties which occur in your way. The ſentiments of the wiſe and the good, and the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental principles of our government, muſt have a powerful operation, and they are both on your ſide. <q>Though you cannot controul Legiſlatures; and though, when you plead the cauſe of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, they will not at all times liſten to you; yet there are other means in your power, perhaps, even more effectual. You can do much by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting your efforts to the conviction of indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals; by diffuſing proper publications among them; and by preſenting the evils of ſlavery, in various forms, to their minds.</q>

The time, I truſt, is not far diſtant, when there ſhall be no ſlavery to lament—no oppreſſion to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in the United States:—when the EMANCI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PATING SPIRIT of our Conſtitution ſhall go forth in "the greatneſs of her ſtrength," breaking in pieces every chain, and trampling down every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt effort of power:—when ſhe ſhall proclaim, even to the ſtranger and the ſojourner, the moment he ſets his foot upon American earth, that the ground on which he treads is ſacred to LIBERTY; and that the air which he breathes, nouriſhes FREEMEN ONLY:—when every being, who bears the name of MAN, whatever complexion an equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torial Sun may have burnt upon him, and with whatever ſolemn injuſtice his rights may have been infringed, ſhall enjoy the privileges, and be raiſed to the dignity which belong to the human cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</p>
