            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>SOON after Solomon came to the Throne of Iſrael, the Lord appeared unto him, and ſaid, "Aſk what I ſhall give thee?" Solomon, deſirous above all earthly Things to be qualified for his high Station, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts neither Riches, nor Honour, nor length of Days, nor the Life of his Enemies, but rather prays for "an underſtanding Heart" And this Prayer "pleaſed the Lord." God loves to ſee Rulers more concerned about their Duty than about their private Intereſt. A benevolent, generous frame of Heart prompting them to do all the Good, in their places, that they can, is pleaſing to the Lord. Wherefore God heard his prayer, and gave him a wiſe and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heart, as he deſired; and long life, riches and honor beſides. <q>God gave Solomon wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:009065_0005_10311AD3ACEF0958"/>
and underſtanding exceeding much, and largeneſs of heart, even as the Sand that is on the Sea-Shore: and Solomon's wiſdom excelled the wiſdom of all the Children of the eaſt Country, and all the wiſdom of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt; for he was wiſer than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the Sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all Nations round about. And there came of all People to hear the wiſdom of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon, from all Kings of the Earth which had heard of his wiſdom: and he ſpake three thouſand Proverbs.</q> — one of which was this, <hi>Righteouſneſs exalteth a Nation: but Sin is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to any People.</hi>—Theſe words then come recommended to our moſt ſerious Conſideration, as containing one of the wiſe Maxims of the wiſeſt of men, a chief political principle of the greateſt Politician; and they furniſh us with a Subject proper for this Occaſion. — Here then, Let us Enquire</p>
            <p n="1">I. WHAT is meant by Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p n="2">II. HOW Righteouſneſs exalteth a Nation.</p>
            <p n="3">III. HOW Sin is a Reproach to any People,</p>
            <p>And then,</p>
            <p n="4">IV. I will endeavour to ſhew that the only way for us in this Colony to be a happy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity is to be a righteous People.</p>
            <p n="1">I. IN the firſt Place, we are to Enquire, what is meant by Righteouneſs. And there
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009065_0006_10311AD6A38A8A90"/>
is no doubt the word is deſigned to compriſe all moral Vertue in general; as it was only in this large and comprehenſive Senſe of the word that National Proſperity and Happineſs were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to Righteouſneſs under the Jewiſh diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation.— But then ſtill it may be enquired, what is the Sum of moral Vertue? and how does Righteouſneſs naturally compriſe the whole?</p>
            <p>TO view Beings and Things as they are, and to be affected and act accordingly is the Sum of moral Vertue. All moral Vertue is frequently, in the ſacred writings ſummed up in one thing, under one comprehenſive Name. For, as every moral Vertue grows up from one Root, and is therefore radically but one thing; ſo with the greateſt propriety all may be called by one Name. Thus LOVE, in fact, is the whole of moral Vertue. And thus LOVE is the Name given to the whole, in that brief Summary of the divine Law given by our bleſſed Saviour. "Thou ſhalt <hi>love</hi> the Lord thy God with all thy heart:" and "thou ſhalt <hi>love</hi> thy Neighbour as thy Self." Love is radically the whole of that Duty which God requires of man. "For on theſe two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands hang all the Law and the Prophets," Yea, Love is the Sum of all God's moral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. And of all holineſs in all holy Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the Univerſe. For the moral Law is the tranſcript of God's moral Perfections. The divine Nature is the original, the divine Law is an exact tranſcript, and in a perfect confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:009065_0007_10311AD8290F3EE8"/>
to this Law conſiſts the perfect holineſs of Angels and Saints in heaven, and in an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect conformity to it conſiſts the imperfect holineſs of Saints on Earth, and the perfect mediatorial Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt is but a perfect conformity to the ſame Rule thro' a courſe of the ſeverelt Trials. For the holineſs of God and Chriſt, of Angels and Saints in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and of Saints on Earth, is of the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, how different ſoever in Degree and in Circumſtances. For there is but one kind of true holineſs in the Univerſe: and all conſiſts in Love <hi>God is Love,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> is the Sum of all that Duty which God requires of Man. — "Thou ſhall Love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart and thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy Self." — But</p>
            <p>LOVE to God and to our Neighbour ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes that we view them as they are, and it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in our being affected accordingly, and this affection naturally excites to an anſwerable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. — And</p>
            <p>TO love God with all our hearts is only to give him his due: for he deſerves it at our hands. And to love our Neighbour as our ſelves, is only to feel them as we would have them feel to us; that is, to do as we would be done by. And therefore to love God with all our hearts, and our Neighbour as our ſelves is in its own Nature <hi>right.</hi>—He then who is thus affected toward God and his Neighbour is, in Scripture,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:009065_0008_10311ADDC5AEDD50"/>
called, a <hi>righteous</hi> Man. He is <hi>rightly</hi> affected. He feels as he ought to do. His heart is <hi>right.</hi> And ſo he is called a <hi>righteous</hi> Man. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> is another Name uſed in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture as comprehending the ſum of all Vertue, even as the word <hi>Sin</hi> is uſed to comprehend all Vice. Thus in our text, <hi>Righteouſneſs exalteth a Nation: but Sin is a reproach to any People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. RIGHTEOUSNESS exalteth a Nation — as it is in itſelf an honourable thing — as it has a natural tendency to make a Nation proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous and happy — and as it will be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſpecial Smiles of him, who loves Righteouſneſs and hates Iniquity, and ſitting at the head of the univerſe, can build up or pull down Nations at his Pleaſure.</p>
            <p>RIGHTEOUSNESS is in its own Nature an honourable Thing. Yea, among all the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Excellencies in the univerſe, there is none of equal Dignity with this. It renders God glorious, Angels lovely, and heaven a place of conſummate Bliſs. Infinite knowlege, almighty Power, and univerſal Dominion ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Deity great; but it is Righteouſneſs, or the moral rectitude of his Nature, that renders him Glorious. Could we conceive an almighty Being at the head of the univerſe, able with the utmoſt eaſe, to accompliſh all his purpoſes, but entirely devoid of moral Rectitude, whatever reaſon there might be to fear and tremble be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, there would be no ground for any one
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:009065_0009_10311ADF4CDEFBA0"/>
in the intellectual ſyſtem to eſteem, love, and honour him. Perfect moral Rectitude is the higheſt Glory of the divine Nature it ſelf. Yea, it is radically the ſum total of all that Beauty there is in the Deity. It is this, that renders every other attribute of God Amiable, and cauſes the divine Being to appear Glorious in the Eyes of Angels, in whatever point of light they view him.</p>
            <p>Is he Almighty, ſo that none can reſiſt him? is he All-knowing, ſo that none can circumvent him? is he Supreme, ſo that none can call him to an account? and is he an abſolute Sovereign, ſo as to be entirely at liberty to conduct accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Council of his own Will? and does his Providence extend to all things in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe? and is this a ſettled Maxim with him, <hi>My Council ſhall ſtand, and I will do all my Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure?</hi> Yet, as he is a Being of perfect moral Rectitude, he is not the leſs, but rather infinitely the more Glorious, in the Eyes of the Angelic world. They rejoice in his Almightineſs and infinite Wiſdom, they exult in his Supremacy and abſolute Sovereignty, and are faviſhed in a view of his univerſal Government, becauſe it is abſolutely perfect They cry one to another, <hi>Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hoſts; the whole earth is full of his Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is not with the great Monarch of the univerſe, as it is many times with earthly Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. They often abuſe their Power, and their
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:009065_0010_10311AE20ADECE70"/>
Supremacy to miſchievous Purpoſes. The thought, that there is none above them to call them to an Account, emboldens them to cruel and barbarous Deeds. And this, amidſt all their external Granduer and Glory, ſinks their Character and renders them odious and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptable. All their royal Dignity looſes its Luſture, while they are without that moral Rectitude, which exalts the great Monarch of the Univerſe above all bleſſing and praiſe.— For, concerning God, it may be ſaid, that great as his Power is, he never uſed it to oppreſs the meaneſt ſubject in his Dominions: and abſolute as his Sovereignty is, he never made one unwiſe decree. His Law is holy, juſt and good, like its Author; perfect in Beauty, without a Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh; ſweeter than honey, yea, than the honey comb: and all his Conduct towards his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is ſo exactly right, and good and wiſe, that it is abſolutely above emendation. In all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances he knows what is beſt to Decree, and what is beſt to Command, and what is beſt to do; and in all inſtances he Decrees, he Commands and he Conducts as well as he knows how. An abſolutely perfect, an infinitely glorious and amiable Being! — It is true, he is accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to none; and it is equally true, there is no need of it: for he is abſolutely perfect.— It is true, "he worketh all things according to the Council of his own Will;" and it is equally true, that the Council of his own Will is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:009065_0011_10311AE624976E80"/>
perfect.— "He doth according to his Pleaſure in the armies of Heaven and among the inhabitants of the Earth, and none can ſtay his hand, or ſay unto him, what doſt thou?" But then, "He is the Rock, his work is Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, for all his ways are Judgment: a God of Truth and without Iniquity, juſt and right is he."—It is true, "He is the high and lofty One, that inhabiteth Eternity, whoſe Name is holy, and who dwelleth in that high and holy Place," infinitely exalted above the nobleſt of his Creatures; yet at the ſame time, "he dwellſ with the humble and contrite, to revive the ſpirit of the humble, and the ſpirit of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite ones."—It is true, He has the care of Kingdoms and Countries, Armies and Fleets; yea, all the grand Affairs of the univerſe lie upon his Hands; for "his Kingdom ruleth over all:" however, he is as mindful of the Widow and the fatherleſs Children, who truſt in him, and takes as good Care of all their Concerns, as tho' he had nothing elſe to do; for "the very hairs of their head are all numbered." — But if we begin to ſpeak in his Praiſe, we know not where to ſtop; for there is no end to the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of his Character. — And, 'tis Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it is the perfect moral rectitude of his Nature, that thus exalts him, and renders him worthy of ſo much honour and praiſe.</p>
            <p>AND it is this, which renders the Angels, the inhabitants of Heaven ſuch glorious Beings.
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:009065_0012_10311AE8ED7DF348"/>
They are like their ſovereign King; holy, as he is holy. Their hearts are right, they feel as they ought to feel. They view all Beings and Things, ſo far as their finite Capacities will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, as they are, and are affected and act accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. They view the Deity as the ſum of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of perfection, and of all Good; as their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, and rightful Lord and Sovereign; and conſider one another as fellow-creatures and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-ſubjects: and they feel and act accordingly. And to Rejoice in God's' exaltation to exult in his abſolute ſupremacy and univerſal Dominion, to be charmed with the beauties of his Character and the perfection of his Conduct, to be entirely dependent on him and abſolutely devoted to him, perfectly united together in Sentiments and in the moſt cordial Love, render them glorious Angels and happy Aſſociates. Righteouſneſs, or moral Rectitude is their Beauty and Glory, and what renders them ſuch a noble and bleſſed Community, under the Government of him, who is abſolutely perfect in the higheſt poſſible Degree.</p>
            <p>AND THIS IS HEAVEN.—And thus Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs exalts that holy Community above.— God poſſeſſes the Throne, not merely as being Creator and Lord of all things, but on the foot of proper Merit and Worthineſs. He is worthy on account of his ſuperior Character: he is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely worthy on account of his infinitely ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Character to take the Throne, and reign

over all for ever and ever: "for his Name alone is excellent, and his Glory is exalted above the heavens." And the Angelic Hoſts, while they ſtand before him, full humility and reverence, of love to him, of harmony among themſelves, all ready to do his will, are worthy to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, and loved, and honoured by their
glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Sovereign.</p>
            <p>FROM Heaven, the world of Righteouſneſs, look down to Hell, the world of Sin and Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, of diſcord and confuſion, of pride, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, envy, and all the furious Paſſions, and view them in contraſt; and well conſider their differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent States, — and behold — thus, Righteouſneſs exalteth the one, — and thus ſin ſinks down the other.</p>
            <p>AND if Righteouſneſs is of ſo honourable a Nature, as thus to exalt even God himſelf, no wonder the wiſe Man ſhould ſay, <hi>Righteouſneſs exalteth a Nation</hi>: If it is the very Glory of the Divinity, if it is the Beauty of Angels, if it is this chiefly which renders Heaven ſo much better than Hell, no wonder Solomon ſhould think it would render Kingdoms, Countries and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on Earth Honourable and Glorious ſhould it once prevail among them.</p>
            <p>LET us ſtop here, a few Minutes, and think, what the Conſequences would be, ſhould Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs which is the Glory of the Deity, and the very Beauty of Heaven, ſhould that holy and divine Temper, which reigns there in Perfection,

deſcend on crowned Heads, and fill the Courts of Princes, and ſpread down thro' every Rank, even down to the meaneſt Cottage, and to the pooreſt Beggar. What would the Conſequences be? Heaven would ſoon begin on Earth.</p>
            <p>PRINCES, even the moſt haughty Monarchs of the Earth, who, to gratify their Pride and Ambition, do often now, in the preſent ſtate of things, ſummon mighty Armies, ſpread war, devaſtation and ruin thro' whole Countries, would be at once turned into other men, "be Converted and become as little Children," as harmleſs as Doves, as meek as Lambs. Such would be their humility, their ſelf-abhorrence, their penitence, their reverence toward the Deity and love to the human kind, that they would, ſpeedily and with the utmoſt ſincerity, begin to concert meaſures for a univerſal, perpetual Peace. Ambaſſadors for that End would be ſent from, and to, every Monarch, Prince and Court — and Orders be ſoon diſpatched to Fleets and Armies to ſtop the effuſion of human Blood. — The thundering Cannons would ceaſe to roar—Peace, univerſal Peace be ſoon proclaimed; for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Monarch, from the heart, would ſoon begin to ſay, to each other, "Take your right my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and let me have mine, and let us live in love and peace, and ſeek the true happineſs of our ſubjects, and no longer go on ſacrificing thouſands of precious lives, in quarrels, which honeſt men might ſettle with the utmoſt eaſe."
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:009065_0015_10311AF1A9645428"/>
And ſo now the "Nations would beat their ſwords into plow-ſhares, and their ſpears into prooning-hooks, neither would they learn war anymore."</p>
            <p>AND ſhould Righteouſneſs, ſhould all right Affections, ſhould ſupreme love to God and Jeſus Chriſt, love to our holy religion, brotherly love, meekneſs, gentleneſs, fidelity, temperance, chaſtity, and all the chriſtian Graces, not only take poſſeſtion of the hearts of Kings, but ſpread thro' all their Royal Families, among their privy Counſellors, thro' their Parliaments, and to all their Courts of Juſtice, and ſhould the ſacred flame fly from City to City, from Town to Town, thro' all their Dominions, and into all their diſtant Colonies, into what a glorious and happy State would things be immediately brought? — Look round upon all ranks and orders of men, and behold the glorious Change!</p>
            <p>GO to the Clergy, and view them in their Studies, or in their Pulpits, behold, they are cloathed with Righteouſneſs, they are inflamed with every holy, pious, benevolent, heavenly affection! they love their Maſter, they love their People, they love their Work: they "de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the law of the Lord, and in his Law do they meditate Day and Night" They are "like Trees planted by the Rivers of Water, whoſe leaf never falls, and which brings forth fruit in their ſeaſon." And out of their "I rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure," from time to time, they "bring forth

things new and old." While their public Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and their Sermons are animated with the humbleſt, pureſt, warmeſt Devotion.—And, O behold, how they love one another! — Look thro' a Province, they are united in the ſame Faith, and love and live as brethren. Yea, look thro' a Kingdom, yea, look from Kingdom to Kingdom, there are no Sects, no Parties, no Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions. They all, Miniſters and People, make up one great Family, united in faith and love; united in one and the ſame Belief, and in the moſt cordial Affection to one another.—And Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of choice give themſelves wholly to their work; and their People from their own inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unite as one to give them an honourable ſupport, not as their burden, but as their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, they even take pleaſure in it.</p>
            <p>GO to the Merchant's Shop, and you will find not only juſt Weights and juſt Meaſures, but alſo piety towards God and love to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man kind, diligence and induſtry, prudence in their calling, frugality in their expences, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity to the poor, charmingly mingled in their Characters. And, while wealth flows in upon them from every quarter, they are cloathed with humility; and they, their Children, and all they have bear this inſcription, in great Capitals, HOLINESS TO THE LORD.</p>
            <p>GO to the Houſe, the happy Houſe of the induſtrious Farmer—in early Morning he, and all his ariſe, and aſſemble to worſhip the GREAT

With alacrity and joy they go forth to their Labours, and enjoy the delights of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in their Fields, love and harmony reign within doors: the Parents happy in God, in one another, and in their Offspring: while their Children grow up in piety toward God, reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence toward their Parents, and in the moſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial Affection to one another. And hearken, and hear the wiſe Maxims of the houſhould, where Righteouſneſs reigns.—"Let us be induſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and frugal, that we may be able to render to all Men their dues.

Yea, let us be induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious and frugal, that we may have wherewith to give to the Poor, and to make the Widow's heart ſing for Joy. And let all we have be conſecrated to God. And while we live upon his Bounty, let us live to his Glory, and prepare for his heavenly Kingdom"</p>
            <p>GO into Neighbourhoods—Malice and Envy are gone—Tattling and Backbiting are no more heard.—Love, undiſſembled Love and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will reign.</p>
            <p>GO to Courts of Juſtice, and behold, they are unfrequented! for the People are become righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and live in Love. And while they do as they would be done by, there ſeldom happens any Affair, that needs to be diſputed at the Bar.</p>

               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:009065_0018_10311AF8E88C7E40"/>GO to the houſe of the Governor, who, as he was advanced to his high Station merely on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Merit; ſo he is the wiſeſt Man in the Province, and a Father to all his Subjects. Every morning and evening he makes King Solomon's Prayer, for a wiſe and underſtanding heart: for it is his great concern to fill his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion well. He is loved, revered, and obeyed by all his People, who live under him as one united happy Family, concientiouſly concerned, by their good behaviour, to render his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as eaſy and happy to him as poſſible. All the influence his high Station, ſuperior Wiſdom and Goodneſs give him over their hearts, is wholly conſecrated to make them a ſtill holier and happier People. For he feels toward them all the Good-will and Tenderneſs, which are wont to reſide in the heart of a nurſing Father or nurſing Mother toward an infant Child.</p>
            <p>GO to the Taverns, and even they are houſes of Piety and good Order. No Rioting or Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, no Chambering or Wantonneſs to be found there. No Town-dwellers aſſembled for Drinking and Debauchery.—No—for there are no ſuch People to be found in Towns where Righteouſneſs univerſally prevails. At theſe Houſes the Stranger and the Traveller may call, refreſh themſelves in quiet, or take lodging in peace, and in the morning go their ways, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing to ſee good Order and Religion reign every where.</p>

               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:009065_0019_10311AFD7169A880"/>GO to the cottages of the Poor, if you can find them, for their number will be but ſmall in ſuch a ſtate of things. None rendered Poor by a courſe of exceſſive Drinking, or by gay Dreſſing, or by high Living, or by Idleneſs, or by any diſhoneſt Practices. A few, perhaps, you may find, rendered Poor thro' ſome natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral infirmity of Body or Mind, or by ſome Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity which it was not in their Power to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee and prevent. And theſe are as Humble as they are Poor. They quietly ſubmit to Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, they are thankful for the little they have, they are induſtrious and prudent according to their abilities; and inſtead of envying their Neighbours, they rejoice in their proſperity. They are beloved by every one; and their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours feel a peculiar Pleaſure in granting them relief from time to time. So that, in the midſt of their Poverty, they are really Happy, and want none of the neceſſaries of Life, and enjoy many of its conveniences.</p>
            <p>GO to the Schools of the Prophets, to the Seminaries of Learning, and ſee a little picture of Heaven. The whole Society in perfect Love and Harmony, making ſwift advances in all Knowledge divine and human, growing up in Love to God and to the human kind, and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening for public Service, under the indefatiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Labours of their wife and learned Inſtructors, whom they love and honour, as dutiful Children do their Parents.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:009065_0020_10311B00C8A55D18"/>MEAN while Peace and Plenty, univerſal Love and Harmony reign from Town to Town, thro' all the Province, thro' all the Kingdom, yea, thro' all the Kingdoms of the Earth, where Righteouſneſs thus prevails. And Heaven looks down propitious, and declares, "Bleſſed ſhalt thou be in thy Baſket and in thy Store, bleſſed ſhalt thou be in the Houſe and in the Field."</p>
            <p>NOR let any think this a diſcription of a fictitious ſtate of Things. Rather let every one know, that all this, and more than all this, ſhall be accompliſhed, when once that petition, ſo often put up by the true followers of Jeſus, by his ſpecial direction, "Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven," is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, and his holy Religion comes to take place among mankind, when once "the Stone cut out without hands becomes a great Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and fills the whole Earth." Nor will what is written fail of an accompliſhment in its ſeaſon. For there has already "come forth a rod out of the ſtem of Jeſſe, and a branch has grown out of his roots," and he has taken "the throne of his father David," that he may reign over "every Nation, Language and Tongue," and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the "greatneſs of the Kingdom under the whole Heaven" is to be given to him. At preſent, for wiſe and holy ends, Satan is ſuffered "to deceive the Nations;" but the day draws high, when he is to be "bound a thousand Years." And then "the Wolf ſhall dwell with
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:009065_0021_10311B025F178C88"/>
the Lamb, and the Leopard ſhall lie down with the Kid, and the Calf, &amp; the young Lion, &amp; the Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the Cow and the Bear ſhall feed, their young ones ſhall lie down together: and the Lion ſhall eat Straw like the Ox: and the ſucking Child ſhall play on the hole of the Aſp, and the weaned Child ſhall put his hand on the Cockatrice-den. They ſhall not hurt nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy in all God's holy Mountain: For the Earth ſhall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the Waters cover the Sea." —And thus <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi> tends to <hi>exalt a Nation,</hi> and to render all the Inhabitants of the Earth happy.— O, how glorious is the Religion of Jeſus Chriſt! When ſhall the Day come, that it ſhall effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally take Place in the hearts of Mankind!</p>
            <p>But, on the other Hand,</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>SIN is a reproach to any People.</hi> It is a reproach it ſelf, and in its effects and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences naturally ſinks a People into Contempt, and brings down the Judgments of Heaven upon them.</p>
            <p>WHEN Civil Rulers have no fear of God before their Eyes, or regard to the public Weal, and act an arbitrary and tyrannical Part—When Subjects deſpiſe the Deity and contemn all Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, are full of Diſcontentment and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring, divided into angry Parties, ready to take Fire on every occaſion—When Miniſters of the Goſpel are unſtudious and ignorant, or
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:009065_0022_10311B05063A7F68"/>
preach Error and practice Wickedneſs, neither caring for the honor of Chriſt, nor the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of immortal Souls, but devoted wholly to their eaſe, or to their worldly intereſt, or to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port Error and encourage Wickedneſs—When people live without God in the World, ſecure in Sin, ſtupid to their eternal Intereſt, hate the Goſpel, grudge Miniſters all they have, envy the Rich, deſpiſe the Poor, and perpetual diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord reigns in Town, and Churches—When neighbours live in Malice and Envy, hateful and hating one another, their Converſation tainted with Ill-nature, and their traffick full of deceit and fraud; or if they are fair to the face, revile behind the back, and no Man's word or promiſe to be truſted.—When People ſpend their time in Idleneſs, their ſubſtance at Taverns, in gay dreſſing, in high living, in Law-ſuits, until Poverty comes like an armed Man— When Peace and Harmony are clean gone, and jarring, angry Paſſions reign, no Godlineſs, no Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, Sabbaths profaned, family Prayer neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Hearts and Hands unclean, Whoredom ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant, no Government civil, eccleſiaſtical, or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic, all Riot and Confuſion: How contempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able is ſuch a Community! how miſerable is ſuch a People! The higher theſe and ſuch like Diſtempers riſe, the greater is their Wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And if they do but begin to creep in among a People, they bring reproach and miſery along with them. For, as Vertue and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:009065_0023_10311B08DA0A36C8"/>
ſo Vice and Miſery are naturally connected together. As "Wiſdoms ways are Pleaſantneſs and all her paths Peace"; ſo "to the Wicked there is no Peace: but they are like the troubled Sea, whoſe waves caſt up Mire and Dirt."</p>
            <p>BESIDES, it may be expected, altho' the full Vials of divine Wrath are reſerved for the world to come, that yet God in righteous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will ſometimes in Anger look down on ſuch a Nation, and ſpread a Curſe over all their Bleſſings, ſo as to render them "Curſed in their Baſket, and in their Store, in the Houſe, and in the Field, and in all they put their hand unto."</p>
            <p>AND thus we ſee what is <hi>meant by Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and <hi>how Righteouſneſs exalts a Nation,</hi> and <hi>how Sin is a reproach to any People</hi>: and ſo we are prepared,</p>
            <p n="4">IV. TO conſider, that the only way for us in this Colony to be a happy Community, is to be a righteous People.—And here let the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing particulars be attended to.—That we in this Colony are under great external Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages to be a happy People.—That notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding our external Advantages our own Vices may render us very Miſerable.— But, if our external Advantages were improved as a virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous People might improve them, we might be very happy.—And it is the Duty of all, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of thoſe in Places of public Truſt, to do all in their Power to promote a univerſal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:009065_0024_10311B0B6E141CB0"/>I. WE in this Colony are under great exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Advantages to be a happy People. We ſit under the ſhadow of our Mother Country, and are protected by the Fleets and Armies of one of the beſt of Kings.. Canada, which has been a scourge to us for many Years, is at preſent in the hands of his-Britiſh Majeſty, our graciouſ Sovereign, our indulgent Father. Louiſbourg; is demoliſhed, Crown-Point is our own, Oſwego; Niagara, and Pittſburgh are in our hands. Our Sea-Coaſts are in no fear of an invading Fleet; our Frontiers are ſecure from the ravages of Popiſh and Pagan cruelty, our Alarms are at an end, and we dwell quietly, each one ſecure under his own Vine, and under his own Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree. — And we dwell in a good Land, in a fertile Country, where we may eat bread to the full, And no greater degree of Induſtry is neceſſary in general than is really for the happineſs of a Community. Might we live in Idleneſs, and yet enjoy ot fullneſſ of all Things; we ſhould not be happier, but rather a more miſerable People: as Idleneſs, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate of Mankind, is naturally productive of many Vices, which bring greater miſery along with them into a Community., than attends a life of honeſt labour.—In a word, we live in ſo good a Land, and enjoy ſuch advantages for Navigation, that, were we vertuous and wiſe; were we prudent and induſtrious, we might have enough of all the good things of this world;
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:009065_0025_10311B0CF6126840"/>
and be in debt to no other Province or People upon the face of the Earth.</p>
            <p>AND, as to civil Priviledges, no Community under heaven enjoys greater, than we do. Nor is it eaſy to conceive what greater civil Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges can be enjoyed than we enjoy. Once every Year, we may unite as Brethren, and chooſe out our wiſeſt and ableſt Men, to make our Laws, to guide our public Affairs, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the deciſion of all our civil Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies. And all our Towns are ſo many Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, inverted with Power to take care of their own public concerns, and ſuppreſs Idleneſs and Debauchery, and every kind of Immorality. And even every little Pariſh has, so far as it needs, for its own well-being, as part of the whole, full Power and Authority to manage and order its own Affairs. Mean while each Family is a diſtinct Kingdom of its own, and for the defence of its rights and properties ſtand intitled to the wiſdom and ſtrength of the whole Community.</p>
            <p>And as to our religious Priviledges, every Man has the Bible in his own hands, and is at liberty to read and think and Judge for himſelf. Every Man, as he is at the Day of Judgment to ſtand or fall for himſelf; ſo is now at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to worſhip God in that way, which he verily thinks will be at last approved of by his Judge, every Pariſh is an eccleſiaſtial Society, inveſted with full Power to chooſe their own Miniſter and provide for his ſupport. And every particular Church is at liberty to come
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:009065_0026_10311B0FE0EC7398"/>
into what Connections they judge moſt for their own Edification. Were any particular Pariſh and Church diſpoſed to be independents, they might be ſo, Or if they chooſe to form them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on the Preſbyterian Plan, they have their liberty. Or if they deſire to declare for the Church of England, there is none to hinder them. Or if they chooſe to be in connection with neighbouring Churches, agreeable to eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Conſtitution of this Government, the door is open, and they are welcome to all the priviledges of ſuch a connection, only ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Orders, and performing the Duties, which are neceſſarily implied in the very nature of the connection it ſelf. And every Pariſh, whether connected or unconnected, is ſtill an eccleſiaſtical Society, and poſſeſſed of all the Priviledges, which our Laws give to all eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Laws in common And had we now but a wiſe and underſtanding Heart to diſcern the good and right way, and could we all to a man agree in our religious Sentiments, we might, as one family, live together in perfect Love and Harmony, as brethren in Chriſt Jeſus, and grow up into a meetneſs to live together for ever, in the world of Love and Harmony above. Or if we differ in ſome leſſer Matters, which all ſides agree not to be eſſential, we ſtill may be happy, if we can only do as we would be done by, let others peaceably and quietly enjoy that Liberty, which we ſhould be glad to enjoy in like Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. And if we differ in important
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:009065_0027_10311B134F020698"/>
Points, with the Bible in our hands, he who is found to be in an Error, will, at the laſt Day ſtand inexcuſable before his Judge; ſpeechleſs, and ſelf-condemned.</p>
            <p>SUCH are our civil and religious Priviledges. —Mean while, we have a ſeminary of Learning in the heart of our Colony, deſigned for the training up a ſufficient number of youth, for public Buſineſſ; that when our Rulers &amp; Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, now on the ſtage, are dead and gone, others may be prepared to take their Places, and do worthily in their day and generation. — And ſuch are our external Advantages to be a happy People. — But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. NOTWlTHSTANDING all our external Advantages to be a happy People, our own Vices may render us very Miſerable: and, inſtead of appearing honourable in the eyes of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours we may ſink down into contempt and rain. For, notwithſtanding the goodneſs of our Land, and all our advantages for Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet luxury, idleneſs, debauchery, diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty and multiplied law ſuits may bring us to Poverty. And if idleneſs and extravagant high living ſhould ſo increaſe among us, that all we have to export out of the Government ſhould yearly fall many Thouſands in value below the Goods imported, our Farmers may ſoon be obliged to reſign their Lands to pay their Debts. And if ſo many Eſtates ſhould be found to be Inſolvent, that our wealthieſt Merchants could ſcarce eſcape Breaking; and if our Lands muſt

be made over to Gentlemen in other Provinces, and we become their Tenants, and have nothing to leave to our Children but Poverty and Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, what a contemptible appearance ſhall we make in the eyes of our Neighbours. <hi>A wiſe Man foreſeeth the evil and hideth himſelf; but the Fool goeth on and is puniſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND all our civil and religious Liberties and Privileges, if we divide into Sects and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and grow Angry, and if we abuſe our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties to the purpoſes of Strife and Contention, to bite, and devour, and oppreſs, they may ceaſe to administer to our comfort in this World, and only ſerve to render us ſo much the more inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuſable and miſerable in the World to come. And our College, if not well inſtructed and governed, inſtead of being a nurſery of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Piety, may become a ſeminary of Error and Wickedneſs, and ſerve but to infect all our Land. And while our idleneſs, our extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gances, our parties, our errors and our wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in general, all join to render us a miſerable People, they will at the ſame time naturally prepare us for and bring down the Judgments of God upon us. And it may come to paſs, when our iniquities are full and we ripe for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction that the cup of trembling, which has been put into the hands of <hi>our Siſter Canada,</hi> may be given us to drink. — <hi>Our Siſter Canada,</hi> I ſay; for <hi>Canada,</hi> with all her wickedneſs, is as much <hi>our Siſter,</hi> as <hi>Sodom</hi> of old was the <hi>Siſter of Judah,</hi> who were by profeſſion God's peculiar
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:009065_0029_10311B1813A64600"/>
People, And God greatly reſented it, that the Jews, in their proſperity, took no notice of the remarkable Vengeance, which he had executed on Sodom their Siſter. And this is brought in, among the reſt of their crimes, in the time of their viſitation, when they were Captives in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, to juſtify the divine ſeverity towards them. <hi>Ezek.</hi> xvi.56. <hi>For thy Siſter Sodom was not mentioned by thy Mouth in the Day of thy pride.</hi> And yet, proud as they were of their own good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, God looked on the Jews more wicked than the Sodomites. <hi>ver.</hi> 48. <hi>As I live, faith the Lord God, Sodom thy Siſter hath not done, ſhe nor her Daughters; as thou haſt done, thou and thy Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi> For when a People who are lifted up to Heaven with Priviledges, yet go on impenitent in their Sins, they are in the eyes of God more guilty than the worſt of the heathen. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was, that our Saviour denounced ſuch heavy woes againſt Coraizin, Bethſaida and Caper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naum becauſe they repented not. <hi>It ſhall be more tollerable,</hi> ſays he, <hi>for Tyre and Sidon, for Sodom and Gomorrah in the Day of Judgment than for you. Mat.</hi> xi.20,—24. — And thus, with all our glorious Priviledges, if we go on impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in our Sins, we ſhall be miſerable while we live, and it will be more tollerable in the day of Judgment for Canada than for us. —</p>
            <p>But on the other hand,</p>
            <p n="3">3. SHOULD God now of his infinite Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy thro' Jeſus Chriſt, after all our aggravated

Provocations, give us <hi>Eyes to ſee</hi> and <hi>Ears to hear</hi> and <hi>Hearts to underſtand</hi>; and ſhould we all, high and low, rich and poor, old and young, be brought each one to <hi>know the Plague of his own Heart</hi>; and not <hi>cover,</hi> but <hi>confeſs our Sins</hi>; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and return to God thro' Jeſus Chriſt, and become Chriſtians indeed, how ſoon ſhould be <hi>healed</hi>! God would become our friend, and we ſhould become friends to one another. We should have <hi>one Lord, one Faith one Baptiſm, one God and Father,</hi> and we all ſhould become Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, united together in the moſt cordial Love, and then there would be an end to all our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions.—Mean while, pride and a luxurious Diſpoſition being mortified, thoſe expenſive and extravagant ways of living, to which our pride and luxuriouſneſs now prompt us, would be looked upon with abhorrence, and laid aſide with ſhame and regret, as infinitely unbecoming a people profeſſing godlineſs. And Idleneſs would begin to appear to us, as it did to St. Paul, a ſcandalous Crime. We ſould look upon an idle Chriſtian, as <hi>a diſorderly Walker,</hi> and in obedience to the Apoſtle's command, <hi>withdraw ourſelves from ſuch.</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ</hi> iii.6,—I4. And <hi>not to provide for our own Houſholds</hi> would be eſteemed a practical apoſtacy of Chriſtianity, <hi>a denying of the Faith,</hi> and <hi>being worſe than Infidels</hi>; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> v.8.—The noiſe of Riot would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be no more heard in our land. Taverns would be empty; induſtry would take place;
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:009065_0031_10311B1CDA870BD0"/>
prudence, frugality, honeſty, and all the ſocial Vertues. In conſequence of which our Debts would ſoon be paid; the Farmer, the Tradeſman, the Merchant get out of their embarraſſed Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and all things begin to put on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther face. And now we ſhould begin to be in a diſpoſition to make a right Improvement of all our external Advantages to be a happy Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.— And</p>
            <p>IF all our external Advantages were improved, as a vertuous People might improve them, we might be very happy. If Solomon's Character of <hi>a vertuous Woman</hi> (<hi>Prov</hi> xxxi.) ſhould become the common Character of our Women; and St. Paul's ſentiments of Induſtry ſhould be prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically eſpouſed by our Men; we ſhould ſoon have a fullneſs of all things. And if humility and love, love to God and to Mankind, if this, which is indeed the true chriſtian Temper, ſhould take full poſſeſſion of all orders and ranks of Men, there would ſoon be an end to all our Parties, and to all our Contentions. For, <hi>from whence come wars and fightings among you,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>Come they not hence even of your Luſts, that war in your Members.</hi> If our Luſts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were mortified there would be an end to all Wars and Contentions. And if love to God and to Mankind took full poſſeſſion of our Souls, we ſhould of courſe feel and live as brethren, in the moſt cordial Friendſhip.— And now,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:009065_0032_10311B22946515A8"/>WE ſhould naturally unite in Chooſing thoſe to rule over us, who are our wiſeſt and ableſt men; and they would naturally be affected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Community as a Father is towards his Children; and we ſhould love and reverence them as our Fathers; our Miniſters would all be united in the ſame Faith; our Churches would walk together in love; and peace and love would reign thro' all our Towns; and no People under heaven would be happier than we. — And let me add,</p>
            <p n="4">4. IT is the Duty of all, eſpecially of thoſe in places of public truſt, to do all in their Power to promote a univerſal reformation.</p>
            <p>IT is the Duty of each and every one of us to be religious ourſelves, to repent and be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, to Give up our ſelves to God thro' Jeſus Chriſt, and live in the daily exerciſe of every divine virtue and Chriſtian Grace, and in the practice of all ſocial Duties, as the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God.— This is our Duty previous to a Conſideration of our temporal Intereſt. For God is worthy of ſupreme love and univerſal Obedience, as he is by Nature God. And he has an original entire right to us, as he is our Creator. And if we bring the work of our redemption into the account, and the eternal rewards of heaven, we are bound, we are under infinite obligations, not only in Duty, but in Gratitude and intereſt to love God and live to him, and do all we can to promote
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:009065_0033_10311B244B561980"/>
his honour, and the intereſts of his Son's king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the world. And all this previous to any earthly Conſideration. Yea, all this altho' we were ſo circumſtanced, as that we might looſe our lives for the profeſſion and practice of Chriſtianity.— But when to all this we add, that we in this Colony are in fact in ſuch Circumſtances, that it would be every way for our preſent intereſt to become ſtrictly religious, that it is the readieſt and directeſt way to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a happy People, yea the only ſure and Certain way, this ſtill further obliges us. And to go on in our ſins, under theſe Circumſtances, is not only to deſpiſe God and the redeemer, and the eternal Joys of heaven, but to be even ſtupid to our own preſent intereſt and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in this world.— Beſides,</p>
            <p>THOSE who are in public truſt, are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under all theſe obligations to be religious themſelves; but they are all under peculiar obligations to do all they can to promote a u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal reformation in others. — And ſuffer me here to ſtate and urge theſe obligations in an addreſs to our Rulers and Teachers.— And</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> — TO our Rulers.— May it pleaſe your HONORS, and you Gentlemen REPRESENTA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIVES, to you belongs it to lend the way, and it is your indiſpenſable Duty to do all that lies in your Power, in your ſeveral Places and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities, to bring about a univerſal reformation among us, and ſo make us a happy people.—
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:009065_0034_10311B26D4A27C68"/>
You owe this Duty to God, who has in the Courſe of his Providence done you this honour, to Conſtitute you our Rulers. He is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of your ſpirits, he formed your Minds, he qualified you for Government, and has diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed you from your Brethren and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and raiſed you up to rule over us. He has committed this People to your Care, and made them your Children, and he has given you wiſdom, and put the ſword in your hands, and you are ſworn to be faithful: and God is your Witneſs, &amp; will be your Judge at that Day, when diveſted of your preſent offices, you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before the bar of Chriſt to receive your final ſentence, in the preſence of the aſſembled univerſe. And if you are unfaithful you never can anſwer it to the Almighty; but will ſtands at his Bar as ſelf-condemned, as you have ſome times ſeen guilty Criminals ſtand at yours.</p>
            <p>HIS HONOR, the Governour, by and with your advice and deſire, has lately ſent his MAJESTY'S Proclamation thro' the Colony, and ordered it to be read twice every year in all our Congregations. It may therefore be Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as your Joint act. And therein you <q>Earneſtly and Strictly require all Perſons within this Government, of every Charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er rank and degree, to exert themſelves in the practice and encouragement of piety and virtue, and in preventing and puniſhing vice, profaneneſs and immorality. And you
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:009065_0035_10311B2A9A4547E0"/>
Command and enjoin Judges, Juſtices and other Magiſtrates, and all informing officers, that they be vigilant and ſtrict in Cauſing the Laws for promoting Religion, Virtue and good Manners to be duly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and in the diſcovery, proſecution and puniſhment of all perſons who ſhall be guilty of the breach of the Laws made for prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and puniſhing profane, vicious, deſolute and immoral practices. And you exhort all his Majeſty's Good Subjects in this Colony, to contribute all in their power, both by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and influence, toward a general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of manners, ſeriouſly Conſidering their indiſpenſable Duty therein, and the awful Conſequences of a neglect thereof.</q>— And now, Gentlemen, you may remember the words of the Lord to his people of old, <hi>they have well ſaid all that they have ſpoken. O that there were ſuch an heart in them</hi>! (<hi>Deut</hi> v.28, 29) —It is eaſier, you are ſenſible, to iſſue out ſuch a Proclamation, than it is to act up to the true purport and ſpirit of it.— <q>Diſmal is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</q> ſays a late writer in England, <q>that no Country has more or better Laws to curb theſe vices than we have, but yet no Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is ſo Corrupted with drunkenneſs and idleneſs as England is at preſent, Conſuming all orders of People.</q> And he adds, <q>one can fearce number all the excellent Laws made from Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time to this
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:009065_0036_10311B2D6E73E820"/>
hour, againſt drunkenneſs, ſwearing, idle and deſolute Perſons, and all vice in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; but ſuch is the groſs neglect of them, as if they had not been enacted.</q> Thus far this writer.<note n="*" place="bottom">See <hi>London Magazine,</hi> for 1760. p. 423.</note> — O never let it be ſaid of us, according to the ancient proverb mentioned by the Prophet Ezekiel, <hi>as is the Mother, ſo is the Daughter.</hi> Remember, Gentlemen, the words of the Lord to good old <hi>Eli,</hi> who, when he heard of the wickedneſs of his Sons, did ſomething equivalent to the iſſuing out of a proclamation to put Laws in execution, without an actual reducing the proclamation into prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. He Called them to an account, and ſaid unto them. <hi>Why do ye theſe things? For I hear of your evil doing: by all this people. Nay my ſons, for it is no good report that I hear.</hi> — But was this enough in the Eyes of God? No. Hear what God ſays. <hi>I will Judge the houſe of Eli for ever, for the iniquity which he knoweth: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Sons made themſelves vile, and he reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them not.</hi> (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> ii.23, 24. &amp; iii.13.) and Gentlemen, is not all the power in the Colony virtually in your hands? Have you not as much power to reſtrain immoralities in any of us, as <hi>Eli</hi> had to reſtrain his Sons? Have not we choſen you to be our Fathers, and called our ſelves your Children, and put ourſelves volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily under your Authority? And if you ſhould take your ſword in hand, and go thoro'ly to
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:009065_0037_10311B2EF7449710"/>
work to ſuppreſs drunkenneſs, idleneſs, and all kinds of debauchery, Heaven and Earth will be on your ſide. None but the vileſt of the people will raiſe a clamour. And ſhall their clamour intimidate you? God forbid! Wherefore as the people ſaid to <hi>Joſhua</hi> when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to extirpate the wicked Cana<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> him, he ſhall be put to death: only be ſtrong and of a good Courage.</hi> So I ſay unto you, in the behalf of all ſober, well-minded people in <hi>Connecticut,</hi> 
               <q>Gentlemen, the Lord be with you in your attempts to ſuppreſs vice &amp; immorality. And let that man be ſeverely puniſhed, that ſhall dare to reſiſt you. Only be ſtrong and of a good Courage.</q>—And pray, Gentlemen, as you have leiſure at this interview, take oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to ſtrengthen one another in this good work: Agree and combine together to carry his Majeſty's proclamation into execution. The Sword is put into your hands for this very purpoſe. God Commands you to be faithful. Your King calls upon you. Your Oath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges you. God will be with you, and all good men will ſtand by you. And if you are indeed faithful in the ſight of God in this, and in all your other Duties, you will have the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your own Minds Living and Dying,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:009065_0038_10311B317420E110"/>
and the eternal rewards of heaven in the world to Come. — Which may God of his infinite Mercy grant thro' Chriſt!</p>
            <p>Secondly. — TO the Miniſters of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel here preſent.—Reverend Fathers and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, when our Rulers are making efforts to bring about a general reformation, how ought we to be affected? And what ought to be our Conduct? Should not we be ready to look up to heaven and devoutly ſay, <q>Bleſſed be the Almighty who hath raiſed us up ſuch a King, and hath put this thing into the hearts of our Rulers. And now may the Lord confirm the heart of our King and of our Rulers in this good work.</q>—and in the mean time our whole Conduct ſhould declare to our rulers and to the world, that we are with them in this thing.— Honor, our Governour, in his Proclamation, has <q>recommended it to us, to inculcate upon our hearers, the importance of this Great and Good Work, and to aſſiſt by our public Miniſtry and private Council and Advice in promoting the ſame.</q>—And Now what ſhall we ſay to our Great Maſter at the Day of Judgment, if we ſhould be cold and indifferent upon ſuch an occaſion as this, and when thus Called upon? Our Saviour was Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous againſt all manner of Wickedneſs at the riſque of his Life. His Apoſtles and firſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters were of the ſame Spirit; and in the
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:009065_0039_10311B34F81091D0"/>
midſt of mighty oppoſition, went every where, preaching, that Men ſhould repent and turn to God. And ſhall we be lukewarm with theſe examples before us? And that when we have ſo many things to animate us from Heaven and Earth? God Forbid.— Wherefore let us upon this occaſion afreſh devote our ſelves wholly to the work of the Miniſtry, and be agreed and united to do our utmoſt to bring about a uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal reformation.</p>
            <p>AND behold, how good and how pleaſant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity! And if we ſhould all Cordially unite in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the true Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, and in bearing teſtimony againſt error and wickedneſs of every kind; and if we ſhould all be thoro'ly engaged to maintain the diſcipline of Chriſt in his houſe, and to prevent the unqualified from entering into the work of the Miniſtry, and to ſtrengthen the hands of our Civil Authority in ſuppreſſing vice: If Rulers and Teachers thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Colony, ſhould be united as one man to bring about a univerſal reformation, might we not hope for the Divine Bleſſing and expect to ſee true religion yet prevail in our land; a land originally ſettled for religious purpoſes; a land under many ſingular obligations to be holy to the Lord?—May God Almighty give us ſuch an heart of his infinite Mercy through Jeſsus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="unknown:009065_0040_10311B376D90AC40"/>TO Conclude, with one word to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation in general.— From all that has been ſaid, the true Source of all our woes in this Colony may eaſily be diſcerned, and the only way for a Cure. <hi>Righteouſneſs exalteth a nation; but Sin is a reproach to any people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND if we look back to the beginning of the World, the experience of all paſt ages ſerves to Confirm us in theſe Sentiments. — How happy was Man at firſt, when Sin was a thing unknown; And had mankind remained in their primitive ſtate of innocence and recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, in love to God and one another, Miſery had been for ever unknown, and this had been a happy World, near akin to Heaven. Sin is the ſource of all that miſery and ruin which has ſpread thro' this apoſtate race. It turned our firſt parents out of paradiſe, and ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them and all their race to Death. It bro't down a flood on the old world, and fire and brimſtone on Sodom, and all the plagues on Egypt. It cauſed the Carcaſes of ſix hundred Thouſand Iſraelites to fall in the Wilderneſs, and was the ſource of all the Judgments which came on God's peculiar People in the days of their Judges and of their Kings. It laid a foundation for their babyloniſh Captivity, and afterwads for their deſtruction by the Romans,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:009065_0041_10311B39556DDED0"/>
Mean while, it has ſpread Miſery and Ruin among all other Nations upon the face of the whole Earth from age to age. — And this dreadful Monſter, this firſt born of Satan, this univerſal deſtroyer, which we Call <hi>Sin,</hi> has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into this Colony! nay, has entered into our hearts, and is the ſource of all our Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Civil, Eccleſiaſtical and Domeſtic. — And ſhall we hug the viper in our Boſoms, and Careſs the ſource of all our woes! God forbid.—Rather having found out the hateful Monſter, let us with a holy indignation bring it out before the Lord, and treat it as <hi>Samuel</hi> did <hi>Agag.</hi>—This is the <hi>Achan,</hi> this is the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler of our Iſrael, wherefore by a univerſal A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement let it be doomed to Death. And while our Rulers and our Teachers arm them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt it, let every Man in the Colony join to ſtone it with ſtones, till it is dead. So let Sin be ſlain. Pride, Luxuriouſneſs, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiouſneſs, Malice, Envy, Idleneſs, Diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, or by whatever other name it is Called, it is <hi>Sin,</hi> and let it die. And let Righteoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs Come and reign in its ſtead. And then small we become a glorious and happy people, and our ſhame ſhall be wiped away.— O who ſhall deliver us from this odious, dreadful Monſter! — Behold the great Meſſiah is appointed to bruiſe the Serpent's Head, and is now exalted at his Father's right hand to give
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:009065_0042_10311B3BD43850B8"/>
repentance and remiſſion of Sins. Therefore in his Name let us look up to God, and Cry mightily for deliverance. — And may heaven hear our Cry, and ſend us help, thro' Jeſus Chriſt, to whom be Glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
