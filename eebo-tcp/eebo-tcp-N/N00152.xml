            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </abbr> in the 15 verse of this Chapter, where we have the wise man saying, <hi>There is a just man that perisheth in his Righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongeth hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="1">1. He doth exhort to beware of errors on the right hand. verse 16th. where there are two errors on the right hand mentioned.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Overmuch Righteousness. <hi>Be not righteous overmuch.</hi> Not that it is possible for any man to have more of real Goodness in him, than he ought to have: but he may be more righteous in his own Conceit, than he should be; and he may be Superstitious, he may adde to the Word of God, which is the rule of Righteousness, Men may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise be more severe in punishing Offenders then the Rule doth allow of, the Corinthians did sometimes erre on that hand, and that is to be righteous overmuch.</p>

            <p>Answ. <hi>Not in respect of the decree of God.</hi> No man shall dy before the Time which the Lord hath determined be fulfilled. The Time of every mans Death is appointed.

But a man may be said to dy before his Time.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In respect of his own expectation.</hi> He may dy before ever he doth expect Death. Hence sinners are said to dy suddenly. 1 Thess. 5. 3. <hi>When they shall say peace and safety, then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travel upon a woman with child and they shall not escape.</hi> Sudden destruction cometh upon sinners, that is, not onely which is in it self sudden, but as to their expectation so. Thus in the Parable concerning the wicked servant. Math. 24. 48, 49, 50. <hi>If that evil servant shall say in his heart, my Lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to smite his fellow-ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, the Lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of.</hi> So doth He dy before his Time wherein he expected death is come. It is often so with them that have been very wicked and Foolish; wherefore it is said in the Parable concerning
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:000210_0007_0FA317B4C51671C8"/>
the Fool when he thought he had many years to live. Luke 12. 20. <hi>God said unto him Thou Fool this night thy soul shall be required of thee.</hi> Hence,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>A sinner may be said to dye before his Time, in respect of his Preparation for a dying hour.</hi> Death may come upon him, before he is prepared to encounter with that enemy. And then he dyeth indeed, <hi>in dying he shall dy,</hi> if death find him unprepared; the second death taketh hold on that soul. The devills sometimes said to Jesus Christ, <hi>Art thus come to torment us before our Time.</hi> Truly such a soul goeth to the Place of Torment before his Time. There is many a sinner that death finds without an Interest in Jesus Christ, There is some sin that he hath not repented of, nay it may be he hath not truly repented of so much as one sin, and then he is not prepared to dy. It had been better for him that he had never been born, than that he should dye and go out of the world in that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>A sinner may dy before that Time be fulfilled, which according to the ordinary course of nature he might have lived.</hi>

The Scripture is full of awfull instances to this Purpose. Again sometimes Gods Vicegerents are improved as executioners of his wrath and justice upon such sinners. The Magistrate beareth not the sword in vain, but is the Minister of God a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evill.

It is a question whether he had so really or no, yet inasmuch as he accused Himself, David condemned him, 2 Sam 1. 16. <hi>David said thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee saying, I have slain the Lords anointed.</hi> So when any poor creature shall say that he hath out-stood and sinned away the day of Grace, albeit the Holy Spirit is secretly striving with him still, or that he hath sinned against the Holy-Ghost.

She was turned into a pillar of salt, that others might be seasoned thereby and preserved from the like evill.

We find the Lord himself giveth this Reason of this matter. Deut. 13. 8,9, 11. <hi>Thou shalt not hearken unto him, neither shall thine eye pitty him, neither shalt thou spare, but thou shalt surely Kill him; and all Israel shall bear and fear and shall doe no more any such wickedness as this is among you.</hi>

wickedly is the greatest foolishness that ever was or can be. Sin is a departure from the Rule of Wisdome. For a man to part with his life for nothing, is not that monstrous folly? And thus doth a wretched sinner doe. Mens sins are unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full works of darkness. What Profit had you of those things whereof ye are now ashamed? Sin is the most unprofitable thing in the world. It is good for nothing, neither for body, nor soul, nor name, nor estate, but brings death and ruin upon all. A man by sin (especially some sins) looseth his Name. A wound and dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Prov. 8. 36. <hi>Hee that sinneth against me wrongs his own soul.</hi> The Impenitent sinner brings ruin upon his own soul. Therefore sin is folly, and and the more sinfull the more foolish. The greatest Sinners are the greatest Fooles in all the world. Wherefore it is said Eccl 9. 3. <hi>The Heart of the sons of men is full of evill, &amp; madness is in their Heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead.</hi> Yea to the Damned! O what horrible madness is it, for any man, that so he may enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season, to venture eternall damnation of his precious and immortall soul?</p>
            <p>Infor. 2. <hi>It followeth from hence, that shortness of dayes is in it self a judgment.</hi> For it is threatned as a Punishment of wickedness. It is a fruit of sin and of the curse. If Adam had not sinned there would have been no short lives, none of his Posterity should have had their lives shortned. And in the times of the Restitution of all things, when the Curse shall be removed, it will not be as at this day. Rev. 21. 4. <hi>There shall be no more death.</hi> To be sure there shall be no more such untimely death as our eyes doe with sadness be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold this day. Look as long life is in it self a blessing, and therefore is Promised as such in the Scripture Psal. 91. 16. <hi>With long life will I satisfie him,</hi> Prov. 4. 10. <hi>Receive my sayings, and the years of thy life shall be many.</hi> and 10. 27. <hi>The fear of the Lord prolongeth dayes.</hi> Whatever any true bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

of God, whilst he was in the world; shall come in upon the account at the last and great day, a glorious reward of mercy shall be given for it, thence is it, so great a mercy to live long. So on the other hand, sho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tion. Psal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 109. 8. <hi>Let his dayes be few.</hi> For when a wicked man dyeth (dying in his sins) He is undone for ever. when once his body is <hi>gone down into the pit</hi> of the grave, and his soul is <hi>gone down into the pit</hi> of eternall darkness, He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hope for the mercy of God, He cannot hope for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of his sin, He cannot hope for the salvation of his soul. Therefore short life is in it self a judgment. Onely as to the elect of God, it is turned into a mercy. As afflictions are in themselves evill and fruits of the curse, but to beleivers they become the greatest blessings. So an untimely death is in it self a great evill, but to one that belongs to the election of grace, it becometh a wonderfull mercy; for it hasteneth his eternall hapiness and glory.</p>
            <p>Infor. 3. <hi>Hence it likewise followeth that Righteousness is the way to obtain long life.</hi> If wickedness bring untimely death, then <hi>Righteousness will deliver from death.</hi> There is no righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man, but shall live in this world so long as life shall be good for him to enjoy.</p>
            <p>But some one will say, do we not see that good men dye when they are young as well as others?</p>
            <p>Answ. Very true. As there are some that are <hi>too wicked to live long,</hi> So there are others that are <hi>too Good to live long;</hi> in such an evill wretched world as this.

               </gap>t of his dayes. Enoch though the best man, and the best minister of God, in all the world in his time, was taken out of the world before he had lived half so long as men in those dayes were wont to live, but then it would not be good for them to live any longer. God is <hi>onely wise</hi> and faithfull, and therefore he taketh his servants to himself, when he seeth that life will not be best for them.</p>

            <p n="3">3. Another Use wee should make of this Providence, is <hi>to beware of those sins which do often times end in untimely death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pride</hi> is one of those sins. <hi>Corah</hi> was a Proud man, He could not bear to be subject to that order neither in Church nor Commonwealth, which God had appointed, and <hi>Hee dyed not the common death of all men.</hi> Haman was exceeding proud and highminded, and his pride brought him to <hi>t</hi>he Gallows at last. But what need wee goe far for examples? One of these poor condemned Creatures that is here standing before the Lord this day, saith that he thinks his pride hath been his ruine. I asked him the other day in the prison, what sin it was that he thought in his Conscience God was provoked with him for, so as to leave him to that which hath brought him under this condemnation? He told me, he thought i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> was for his Pride. <hi>For he thought much of it that such an one as He should be a servant, and he sometimes used such words as these, I am flesh and blood as well as my Master and therefore I know no reason why my Master should not obey me as well as I obey him.</hi> Thus did he say, and now we see what his Pride
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:000210_0021_0FA317BF45EB1B30"/>
brought him unto, therefore beware of that sin.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Idleness</hi> is a sin that doth bring many to a miserable end at last. It was one of those sins which caused thousands in Sodom and Gomorrah to <hi>dy before their Time</hi> in a dreadfull manner. As for one of these poor condemned Creatures <hi>Idleness</hi> hath been his bane. He would not diligently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the calling which he was set in, but lived an Idle va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ant life, and what is he now come to? Therefore beware of that sin.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Disobedience to Parents</hi> is a sin that is often punished with untimely death. (as was partly intimated before) One of these that are to be <hi>executed</hi> this day, doth confess that his disobedience to his Parents hath provoked the Lord, to bring this misery upon him. He faith that when he was a Child his Father gave him good Instructions and prayed for him, but he regarded it not. His Father would have had him gone to School, but he would not. His Father would have had him gone to a Trade but he would not; And after his Father was dead, he would not be subject to those that had the care and charge of him, but ran away from them, and since that from time to time hath run away from them that have been his Masters. And now behold what all this disobedience, hath brought him unto. All you <hi>disobedient Children</hi> that are here before the Lord this day, hearken to the Word of the Lord. There is a Scripture which methinks should strike Terror and Trembling into your Souls, It is that Prov. 30. 17. <hi>The eye that mocketh his Father and despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to obey his Mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles eat it.</hi> The eye that mocketh his Father.

Yea God is so provoked with such wicked children, as that he doth sometimes leave them against nature to destroy themselves as a just Punishment of unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall disobedience.

               </note> who are standing in the solemn presence of the Lord, and whose naked souls must by and by appear before God the Judge of all, to receive a Sentence either of eternal Life, or of eternal Death. Hearken you to the word of the Lord this once. I beseech you mind what I say, because you are now come unto your last hour. It may be there are many here this day, that this is the last Sermon, that ever they shall hear, but as for you the thing is Certain, you shall never hear ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sermon; and therefore let these words sink down into your Ears and Hearts.</p>
            <p>A few <hi>Considerations</hi> and <hi>Directions</hi> let me spread be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you.</p>
            <p n="1">Consider. 1. <hi>That you have been wicked overmuch.</hi> The sin which you are now to dye for is exceeding great, even <hi>Murder.</hi> The Scripture faith that <hi>no Murderer hath eternal life.</hi> And there is another Scripture that saith, that <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers shall have their Part in that Lake which burns with fire and brimstone which is the second Death.</hi> And no doubt you have been guilty of many other Greivous sins, which have provoked the Lord to leave you unto the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of this horrid <hi>Murther.</hi> This <hi>Murther</hi> also is exceedingly aggravated in respect of the person whom you have slain, even your <hi>Master.</hi> O, how have you risen up in
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:000210_0025_0FA317C246EFB220"/>
Rebellion against the glorious Image of God, not onely in that you have shed the blood of a man, who was made after the <hi>Image of God,</hi> but such a man as had peculiar <hi>Dominion</hi> over you, in that respect you have offered fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full violence to the sacred Image of the blessed God. So that you have tran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>grest the <hi>fifth and sixth Commandments</hi> at once in the highest degree that you could doe. And since your Apprehension, yea Conviction and Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation you have told many lies (at least one of you, it is to be feared both of you) against your Conscience.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Consider that <hi>now you must dye before your Time,</hi> especially one of you, a poor young creature that hath hardly lived twenty years in this world, and must this day be turned out of it. Yea both of you <hi>dy before your Time.</hi> you might according to the ordinary course of nature have lived many a year. You must be cut off by a violent and dreadfull death. For indeed the anger of the Lord would fall upon this whole Country where your sin hath been committed, if you should be suffered to live.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Consider, <hi>That there is yet a possibility for you to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape the second death.</hi> Though your sin be very great, yet God can pardon it. I remember a passage concerning a poor creature that was condemned to dye for wickedness he had been guilty of (I the rather mention it because he was Country man to one of you) but when he was in Person gave good Hopes of his unfaigned Repentance, <note place="margin">See the book c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

And Saul (afterwards Paul) had once the guilt of blood upon him, And therefore he made his Confession before the Lord, Saying, <hi>Lord; When the blood of thy Martyr Steven was shed, I also was standing by and Consenting to his death.</hi> Yet when he did repent and I unto God in Jesus Christ, God forgave him his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. Know therefore, that there is Mercy enough with God to Pardon and Save as great sinners as you are.</p>
            <p>And know, that Jesus Christ the Son of God, Came to <hi>Save the chief of sinners.</hi> There is Merit and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness enough in Jesus Christ. Hee was bruised for our In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The Blood of Christ can satisfie for the blood which you have shed. Jesus doth deliver from wrath to come. And he doth not exclude you from salvation by him, if you doe not by Impeni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ency &amp; Unbelief exclude your selves. Neither can the death you suffer hinder the Salvation of your souls, in case you truly repent and believe. Jesus Christ hath been made a Curse, that so he might redeem from the Curse of the Law. Yea Hee (the blessed son of God) was hanged upon a Tree, though Hee never knew any sin. only for the sins of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and therefore he hath sanctified all maner of deaths unto those that shall beleive on Him. Oh Consider of it and let it break your Hearts.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Consider <hi>Presently it will be too late for you to think of these things.</hi> when once you are dead, when once your souls are out of your bodyes, it will be too late for you to think of these matters. There is no Repenting in the Grave, there is no Believing in Hell. Behold <hi>now</hi> is your accepted Time, <hi>now</hi> is the hour of your Salvation.
