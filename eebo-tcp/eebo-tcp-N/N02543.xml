            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

THis is the <hi>ſecond Eſſay</hi> of the Rev. <hi>Author,</hi> ſince the great and terrible EARTHQUAKE, which ſurpris'd and aſtoniſh'd us on the 29 of <hi>October</hi> laſt, (the <hi>Tremors</hi> conſequent upon, which do continue to this Day) by the Will and Bleſſing of GOD to faſten ſutable <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Sinners;</hi> and to <hi>warn</hi> thoſe of ſome more dreadful <hi>Stroke</hi> from the Hand of an angry GOD, who <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to continue in their provoking Impenitence.</p>
            <p>AND certainly the whole Story of GOD'S righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Judgments through the <hi>Holy Bible</hi> admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes us of <hi>this,</hi> from the days of <hi>Noah</hi> to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi>'s ſecond deſolation.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Old World</hi> was endured and waited on by the <hi>Long ſuffering</hi> of GOD, for how many Ages, under the Warnings of <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> but at laſt <hi>the Fountains of the great Deep were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up</hi> to overwhelm them. They ſaw the <hi>Ark</hi> building, they were told <hi>for what,</hi> but they careleſly and obſtinately <hi>quenched the ſtriving</hi> SPIRIT of GOD; and the <hi>Flood</hi> came and drown'd 'em.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sodom</hi> afterward ſinned againſt the <hi>Means of Grace</hi> in the Nei'bourhood of <hi>Melchiſedek</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and when they would not be reformed by the Doctrine, Example, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs of thoſe <hi>Holy Men of</hi> GOD, but gave themſelves over to the fire of luſt, the <hi>Fire of</hi> GOD fell upon them and conſumed them.</p>

            </p>
            <p>THE Story of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> would be too long to enter on: What <hi>Means of Grace</hi> they were diſtinguiſh'd with; How <hi>loth</hi> the HOLY ONE was to make them as <hi>Admah</hi> and ſet them as <hi>Zeboim;</hi> How often <hi>his Repentings kindled together;</hi> But their Overthrow was at laſt with a Vengeance <hi>greater</hi> (as the <hi>Prophet</hi> tho't) <hi>than the Puniſhment of Sodom, which pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in a moment, and no hand ſtayed on her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE now are like Inſtances and Monuments of the <hi>Patience</hi> and Longſuffering of CHRIST, ſtriving with us by his awakening SPIRIT, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> of his Word, and the <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of his Providence; And becauſe the common and <hi>ordinary Means</hi> have had ſo little power and effect on us, GOD has uſed <hi>One</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together <hi>new</hi> and extraordinary. He hath <hi>roar'd out of Zion</hi> in a way that we never heard before; even out of the <hi>bowels</hi> of the Earth, and as from the very <hi>belly of hell,</hi> we have heard his terrible <hi>Voice;</hi> like <hi>the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet from the burning and ſhaking Mountain,</hi> at

                  <p>SHE obeyed not the Voice: ſhe received not Correction: ſhe truſted not in the LORD: ſhe drew not near to her GOD. I ſaid, ſurely thou wilt fear me: thou wilt receive Inſtruction: ſo their dwellings ſhould not be out off, howſoever I puniſhed them: but they roſe early and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted all their doings. Therefore wait ye upon me, ſaith the LORD, until the day that I riſe up to the prey; for my Determination is — to pour upon them mine Indignation, even all my fierce Anger, for all the Earth ſhall be devoured with the Fire of my Jealouſie.</p>

            <p>SINCE whatſoever Things were written aforetime, were written for our Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, i. e. for our <hi>Inſtruction</hi> and <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition</hi> on whom the Ends of the World are come, it certainly, greatly concerns us to hear Counſel, and receive Inſtruction, by the Calls of GOD, and to take Warning
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:003015_0008_0FEF9F64D406BD50"/>by the Denunciations of His Wrath againſt His <hi>Covenant profeſſing People</hi> in former Ages of the World: By doing ſo, we ſhould make a wiſe and good Improvement of the Lord's terrible Diſpenſations towards them. Would to GOD, we might be enabled to ſuch an Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſolemn Reproofs, and awful Warnings diſpenſed by the holy <hi>Prophet,</hi> who ſpake the Words I have now read: He was ſent from GOD, was authoriz'd and commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd by Him, to reprove ſharply, all Ranks and Orders of Men, for their Sins; for their Idolatry, Apoſtacy, Forgetfulneſs of GOD, and their Duty, and the ſinful Faſhions of too many in their Habits, and the violent Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of many, which with many other provoking Evils were found in the midſt of them, and were abounding among them, for which they were threatned with ſevere Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, yea, and with an utter Deſolation, with the like Deſolation that had been brought on other Nations and People, not far from them; theſe terrible Examples the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſets before them, to move and excite them to conſider, repent, and amend their Ways, and ſo prevent the Infliction of threatned Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which without ſuch a Repentance and Reformation, would certainly, and ſuddenly be brought upon them. The <hi>Prophet</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore does moſt affectionately exhort and urge them to Repentance, by the Examples of thoſe whoſe Impenitence added to their Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities ruin'd them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:003015_0008_0FEF9F64D406BD50"/>
BY many gracious Promiſes and Encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, He excites them to look and hope for Mercy, upon their hearkening to His Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, that He would then preſerve a <hi>Remnant</hi> of them, amidſt all the waſting Calamities and Judgments, that ſhould follow them, who ſhould rejoice in the GOD of their Salvation, becauſe GOD would in the midſt of Judgment remember Mercy for them.</p>
            <p>IN the beginning of this <hi>Propheſy</hi> is foretold the approaching Deſolation of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem; I will utterly conſume all Things from off the Land, ſaith the Lord: I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume Man and Beaſt, I will alſo ſtretch out mine Hand upon Judah, and upon all the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of Jeruſalem.</hi> It intimates that by ſome immediate and awful Stroke of His holy Hand, He would bring a dreadful Deſtruction upon them, and not only upon the idolatrous Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers of the Hoſt of Heaven, but upon ſuch as <hi>have turned back from the Lord, and thoſe that have not ſought the Lord the Lord, nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired after Him:</hi> i. e. Such as have forſaken the Lord and His pure Worſhip, or that have turned <hi>Atheiſts;</hi> in their Hearts ſay, and by their Practices declare, <hi>That there is no GOD,</hi> and therefore will not call upon His Name, nor ſtir up themſelves to take hold of Him; ſuch alſo are doom'd to Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>THE Prophet then calls upon them in ſuch awful Terms as theſe, <hi>Hold thy Peace at the Preſence of the Lord GOD, for the Day of the Lord is at Hand, And it ſhall come to paſs in
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:003015_0009_0FEF9F676F6529D8"/>that Day, that I will puniſh all ſuch as are clothed with ſtrange Aparrel.</hi> An Expoſitor ſays upon this Place <note n="†" place="bottom">Pool.</note>, That the wanton Jews were wont to imitate the Garb of Foreigners. They were doubtleſs ſome very indecent Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions, and it's probable very extravagant, that they run into, for which GOD ſo awful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and particularly threatens to puniſh them. [But ſuch Threatnings it's to be fear'd were not much regarded <hi>then,</hi> and will be very little <hi>now,</hi> by thoſe who are moſt criminal and faulty in ſuch Extravagance. It is ſadly evident, there has been too much of it in almoſt every Town in the Land, as well as <hi>This;</hi> I wiſh thoſe whom it moſt concerns, would conſider ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly of it, and ſo adorn themſelves, as to prevent ſuch an extravagant Expence, as too commonly attends ſome <hi>vain Ornaments.</hi> Tho' I don't think this to be the moſt crying Sin of this Land; yet I believe many who are ſo clothed, may do well to think ſeriouſly with themſelves, whether notwithſtanding this Threatning in my Context, and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 3.18. which they may read at their Leiſure, they can think themſelves <hi>wholly without Blame?</hi> When GOD ſo ſolemnly and particularly threatens to puniſh for <hi>ſtrange Aparrel,</hi> and ſpeaks of a Day a coming, in which He will take away the <hi>bravery of ſome Ornaments,</hi> too much like thoſe I am ſpeaking of, I am ſure, ſuch as are ſerious and thoughtful, will be
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:003015_0009_0FEF9F676F6529D8"/>not a little concern'd, leſt a holy GOD ſhould be offended by their <hi>Exceſs</hi> in this Regard. I will conclude this Digreſſion, with that ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Exhortation to us all; 1 Tim. 2.8, 9. <hi>I will therefore that Men pray every where, lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up holy Hands, without Wrath and Doubting. In like Manner alſo, that Women adorn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in modeſt Aparrel, with ſhamefacedneſs and Sobriety, and not with coſtly Array, but (which becomes Women profeſſing Godlineſs) with good Works.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I go on now to ſhew, What GOD foretells there ſhall be immediately after He had ſaid, That He would puniſh ſuch as were cloth'd with <hi>ſtrange Aparrel; It ſhall come to paſs in that Day, ſaith the Lord, that where ſhall be the Noiſe of a Cry, and an Howling, and a great craſhing from the Hills;</hi> (probably, in a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, tremendous EARTHQUAKE) which the Prophet ſays, ſhould <hi>make them cry alo<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> and bitterly;</hi> then the Lord declares, <hi>He will puniſh the Men that are ſettled on their Lees:</hi> Such as were always deaf to the Voice of GOD by His Word and Judgments, and refus'd to receive Correction, would not be reform'd by all the dreadful Judgments of GOD, but went on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigibly in their evil Ways; ſuch ſhall be now ſeverely puniſh'd, and made to ſee and know, that there is a GOD that judges in the Earth, and that it ſhall be <hi>well with the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and ill with the Wicked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Prophet goes on and declares, <hi>The great Day of the Lord is near, it is near, and haſteth
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:003015_0010_0FEF9F69EF6BA9E8"/>greatly, even the Voice of the Day of the Lord, the mighty Man ſhall cry bitterly:</hi> The moſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant, and ſtout hearted, their Hearts ſhall in that Day fail them for Fear, of what may be coming upon them: Their <hi>Fleſh ſhall</hi> now <hi>tremble for Fear of GOD, and they ſhall be</hi> now <hi>afraid of His Judgments: Fearfulneſs and Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lling will now come upon them, which will make all their Bones to ſhake;</hi> and <hi>Deſtruction from the Lord, ſhall be a Teyyor to them,</hi> ſo that their Outcries ſhall be very vehement, there will be <hi>Bitterneſs of Heart, and bitter Wailing;</hi> for that Day, the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſays in the next Verſe, will be a <hi>Day of Wrath, a Day of Trouble and Diſtreſs, a Day of Waſtneſs and Deſolation, a Day of Darkneſs and Gloomineſs, a Day of Clouds and thick Darkneſs.</hi> The <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> here heaps up Words of much the ſame Senſe, to expreſs the grievouſneſs of thoſe Troubles, that ſhould ſuddenly come upon them, moſt diſtreſſing Troubles, none knowing how to bear them, or where to hide from them. In the <hi>next Verſe</hi> but one, he ſays, <hi>I will bring Diſtreſs upon Men, becauſe they have ſinned againſt the Lord;</hi> becauſe their Sins have been many and greatly aggravated, and ſo the more provoking to Me; He then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares that neither <hi>their Silver, nor their Gold ſhall he able to deliver them in the Day of the Lord's Wrath; but the whole Land ſhall be devoured by the Fire of His Jealouſy, for He ſhall make even a ſpeedy Riddance of all them that dwell in the Land:</hi> They muſt now feel
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:003015_0010_0FEF9F69EF6BA9E8"/>the terrible Impreſſions of the Wrath of a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Judge, for their Sins; that Fire being kindled thereby, that none could quench: Though GOD had with wonderful Patience waited and born with them, He would now wait no longer, but ſpeedily execute His ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Threatnings of Wrath upon them.</p>
            <p>THE holy Prophet now earneſtly exhorts them to Repentance before the threatned Judgments ſhould be inflicted; he therefore thus calls upon them, <hi>Gather your ſelves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yea, gather together, O Nation n<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> deſired, call a ſolemn Aſſembly, proclaim a Faſt;</hi> Let all the People know of it, and when aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, ſearch your ſelves, your Hearts and Ways, and <hi>Repent:</hi> It was repeated, it's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, to affect them the more, and quicken them to their Duty and make them more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and in good earneſt in the Work of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. O Nation not deſired!</hi> Not deſirous of returning to GOD, though you have fall'n by your Iniquities; unwilling to return, and unworthy of being received upon your Return: Yet gather together, and do what you poſſibly can for your Safety; <hi>before the Decree bring forth, before the Day paſs as the Chaff, before the fierce Anger of the Lord come upon you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Day of the Lord's Anger coure upon you:</hi> GOD is juſt ready to bring down de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved Vengeance upon you, be therefore ſpeedy in your Repentance, before the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Day arrives, the Day of His righteous Diſpleaſure, which will carry the wicked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:003015_0011_0FEF9F6BC96578C8"/>as the Wind carries the Chaff away for the Fire, while the good Grain ſhall be gather'd and preſerv'd. It is here call'd <hi>fierce</hi> Anger, which means the heat of GOD's Anger; In the <hi>firſt Chapter,</hi> It is call'd, <hi>Jealouſy like Fire,</hi> and here it's call'd the <hi>Heat</hi> of that <hi>Fire,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating the greatneſs of GOD's Anger: It ſhall come upon you, as a Storm, with irreſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and deſtructive Violence, and the Wain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is doubled to make them take the more Notice of it.</p>
            <p>HE then calls upon the <hi>Meek of the Earth to ſeek the Lord, to ſeek Righteouſneſs, and Meekneſs,</hi> for it may be, <hi>they ſhould be hid in the Day of the Lord's Anger.</hi> He calls on them thus to ſeek for pardoning Mercy, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in a Courſe of Obedience to the Laws of GOD, to ſeek the Knowledge of GOD, and their Duty, and comply therewith; to fear and ſerve the great GOD. But mind, 'tis the <hi>bumble</hi> that are here call'd on, ſuch as had not harden'd themſelves in Wickedneſs, as other ſtubborn, proud, idolatrous Sinners had done; he ſeems to call on ſuch who trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at GOD's Word, and at His Judgments, who had ſome Year and Concern of Soul a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their Danger and eſcaping his fiery In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation; that they would humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves yet more under the mighty Hand of GOD, and hope in His Mercy, and wait on Him for His Salvation: It may be, you may be hid, this is ſufficient to raiſe your Hope, peradventure the Lord will be <hi>gracious;</hi> if it
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:003015_0011_0FEF9F6BC96578C8"/>be not certain, yet it is not impoſſible, but that you may be hid under the Shadow of His Wings, in the Day of His Anger, be taken under His Care and Protection, and ſo <hi>have reſt in the Day of Trouble;</hi> or have the threatned Calamities and Judgments averted.</p>
            <p>HE further tells them, that it is high time to make GOD their Refuge, and repair to to Him as ſuch; for their Neighbours as well as they ſhould be deſtroyed, there ſhould therefore be no Refuge for them among their Neighbours, that therefore if they would not fear the Lord, who is terrible in His Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Deſolation would quickly come upon them.</p>
            <p>THE faithful Prophet therefore in the <hi>begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> of this <hi>Chapter</hi> containing my Text, threatens them with deſtroying Judgments. <q>From the dreadful Spectacle of <hi>Nineveh</hi>'s Ruin for her Sins, He would have them take a Proſpect of what was coming upon <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which would alſo er'e long be full of Woes, becauſe full of Sin.</q> And in the Words I have read, He gives the Reaſons for it; <q>
                  <hi>She obeyed not the Voice,</hi> the Voice of the Law, or Prophets, of GOD's faithful Meſſengers, nor His Voice by His Mercy or Judgments, crying aloud, warning, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting and perſwading to return.</q> 
               <hi>She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived not Correction or Inſtruction,</hi> as it may be read; ſhe did not learn, ſhe would not be inſtructed; it indeed means more than is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, even that ſhe <hi>hated Inſtruction,</hi> and
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:003015_0012_0FEF9F6ECACDE650"/>truſted not in the Lord, would not make Him her Refuge, or in Diſtreſs draw near to Him by Prayer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I ſaid ſurely, thou wilt fear me;</hi> 
               <q>I thought or concluded (ſpeaking after the Manner of Men) what I might juſtly expect, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the many &amp; terrible Judgments executed upon others,</q> which they have ſeen or heard of, they would fear ſo as to ſin no more, leſt the like come upon them. <hi>That they would</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>receive Inſtruction,</hi> learn their Duty and comply with it, their Danger, to prevent it, their Sins, that they might repent of them, their Ways, that they might amend them, that ſo their Dwellings might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</q> 
               <hi>Howſoever I</hi> might otherwiſe <hi>puniſh them,</hi> 
               <q>Whatever I had done againſt them, however I had chaſtiſed them, had they been bettered, humbled and amended, I would have ſpared, and not deſtroyed them utterly.</q> 
               <hi>But they roſe early and corrupted all their Doings;</hi> 
               <q>They grew worſe and worſe, more eager in the Purſuit of their vile Courſes; as if the Day would be too ſhort for their Sins, they riſe early and begin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times; they deſignedly and out of ſet Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, did worſe and worſe, though they were ſmitten, yet they revolted more and more.</q> 
               <hi>Therefore wait ye upon me, ſaith the Lord, until the Day that I riſe up to the Prey;</hi> Since you will not be reformed by all that I have already done unto you, but grow worſe and worſe; <q>You that are thus ſtubborn

               <hi>For my Determination is to pour upon them mine Indignation, even all my fierce Anger;</hi> 
               <q>It is my fixed Purpoſe, that which I have unalterably reſolv'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</q> to execute the Fierceneſs of mine Anger upon them, if they continue in their obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and incorrigibleneſs, for this will inkindle mine Anger againſt them; <hi>for all the Earth ſhall be devoured with the Fire of my Jealouſie;</hi>

            <p>THESE Obſervations, I think, ly plainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us in the Text; I ſhall as the Time will allow ſpeak to each of them. I begin with the firſt,</p>

               <hi>OBSERV. I.</hi> THE profeſſing People of GOD are too often chargeable with the Guilt of not obeying the Voice of the Lord.</p>
            <p>THIS Charge was exhibited againſt GOD's Covenant profeſſing People of old, and there is too much Reaſon to fear, it may be ſo, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us His viſible profeſſing People now.</p>
            <p>HERE I would ſay particularly,</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>MULTITUDES do not obey the Voice of GOD by His written Word.</hi> Though the great Things of GOD's Law are written to is, yet by how many are they accounted as a ſtrange thing; ſuch is the Corruption and Wickedneſs in the Hearts of many, that they practically ſay to Almighty GOD, <hi>Depart from us, for we deſire not the Knowledge of thy

            </p>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>THERE are Multitudes among the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing People of GOD, that do not obey His Voice by His Embaſſadors.</hi> And no wonder it is ſo, when the Voice of GOD by His written Word, is not hearkned to; from the very ſame Principle of Enmity to GOD and His holy Laws and Precepts, they will not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to GOD's faithful Meſſengers; <hi>Though they cry aloud, and lift up their Voice like a Trumpet,</hi> when they would ſound an Alarm to an impenitent and wicked World, and <hi>ſpare not</hi> faithfully to ſhew to ſuch a People their <hi>Tranſgreſſions</hi> and their <hi>Sins,</hi> their Sins of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,</hi> and of <hi>Commiſſion</hi> they indulge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

            </p>
            <p>Again,</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>THERE are too many that do not obey the Voice of GOD by His Judgments inflicted, or threatned.</hi> Though there be a Voice of GOD, and a <hi>mighty Voice,</hi> in all ſuch Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, both to <hi>the Town,</hi> and <hi>Country,</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when the Great GOD does by His <hi>Voice ſhake the Wilderneſs,</hi> and threaten to bury us, and our Houſes, and all we have, in the <hi>deep Places of the Earth,</hi> from whence His Voice has come with a <hi>dreadful Sound in our Ears;</hi> yet are there not too many, that do not ſo hearken even to this <hi>awful Voice,</hi> as they ſhould, or elſe they would have ſear'd and trembl'd more before that GOD, who ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly <hi>roared out of Zion.</hi>

               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:003015_0015_0FEF9F785587D358"/>
Again,</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>MANY do not obey the Voice of GOD by His Mercies.</hi> There is a Voice in theſe, as well as in His Judgments. The Goodneſs and Mercy of GOD to us in the various Inſtances of it, do call, and ſhould lead us to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as well as His judicial Diſpenſations. The innumerable Favours of GOD vouchſafed to us do call upon us to love, and ſerve, and live devoted to the GOD, who is ſo loading us with His Benefits; all ſignal Preſervations do yet more eſpecially do ſo; Preſervations from <hi>Thunder</hi> and <hi>Lightning, Storms</hi> and <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts,</hi> and <hi>terrible Earthquakes,</hi> in a particular Manner, which might, and ſo often have prov'd fatal and deſtructive unto Multitudes. How many populous Places have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by the amazing <hi>Judgment</hi> of the <hi>Eartk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake,</hi> and Multitudes ſwallowed up quick in the Pit, while the Lord has only ſhaken the Earth under us, and no Damage done, either to Man or Beaſt: So marvellous has been the Deliverance and Salvation granted to us; But may it not be fear'd, that many have not duly hearkned to the Voice of GOD in ſuch a remarkable Deliverance, have not been duly thankful to GOD for it, and concern'd to anſwer His Expectations in ſo ſparing them? Such as have not had a due Sollicitude of Soul about this, may be ſaid, not to obey the Voice of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Again,</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>MANY do not obey the Voice of the Lord by His Spirit.</hi> Though the Spirit of GOD does
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:003015_0015_0FEF9F785587D358"/>many Times by His ſecret Motions, convince Men of their Sloth and Negligence as to the great Concerns of their Souls, and Eternity, and their utter Unpreparedneſs for Death and Judgment, and does ſometimes evidently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite them to enquire, as the <hi>Jaylour</hi> did after the <hi>Earthquake, What muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi> And ſo to <hi>ſeek the Lord, while He may be ſound, and to call on Him, while He is near,</hi> and to <hi>work out their Salvation with Fear and Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,</hi> and delay doing it no longer; yet how many do not cheriſh and purſue ſuch Convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? Yea, Do not too many knowingly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and reſiſt the ſtriving Spirit of GOD, thus at work upon their Hearts, and thereby make it evident, at leaſt to themſelves, that they do not obey the Voice of GOD?</p>
            <p>I might ſay again,</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>MANY do not obey the Voice of GOD by their own Conſciences.</hi> Though their enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Conſciences are ſo far awakned, as to do their Office upon them, and charge home Guilt lying on them, with reſpect either to Omiſſions of Duty, or Commiſſions of Evil, or both, they have allow'd themſelves in; Tho' their <hi>Conſciences</hi> do ſometimes ſuggeſt to them, they have gone on in fooliſh and hurtful Ways, to the Diſhonour of GOD, and the wounding of their Souls and Bodies, <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Eſtate,</hi> and thereby laid in for a bitter Repentance, and that there muſt be ſooner or later a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi> and a more holy circumſpect Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:003015_0016_0FEF9F7AE7DF7560"/>and Walking than there has ever yet been; yet have not many perſiſted in their evil Ways under and after ſuch evident Convictions &amp; Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions from their own Conſciences? all ſuch do not obey the Voice of the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally, IF we don't receive Correction, and truſt in the Lord, and draw near to our GOD, we do not obey His Voice.</hi> If we do not chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſubmit to the Diſcipline of His Rod, acknowledge His Juſtice and Righteouſneſs in His judicial Diſpenſations, and ſet upon cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting the Errors of our Lives, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to GOD, as the Hope of His People, and their Saviour in the Day of Trouble, and call upon Him in ſuch a Day: In ſhort, If we are not brought nearer to GOD by His aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Viſitations, if we don't become more prayerful than ever, we are chargeable with the Guilt of not obeying the Voice of the Lord; and may it not be fear'd, that many are in theſe Reſpects, guilty before GOD, for which He may be juſtly angry with them?</p>
            <p>BUT ſo much for the firſt Obſervation. I proceed to the ſecond.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>OBSERV. II.</hi> GOD may juſtly expect that we fear Him, and receive Inſtruction by His Judgments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I ſaid, ſurely, Thou wilt fear me, then wilt receive Inſtruction.</hi>

THE judgments of GOD have a wonderful Tendency to excite us to <hi>fear</hi> and tremble before Him, and He always ſends them, or threatens the Infliction of them to excite a holy Fear of Him in the Hearts of His Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and when they don't attain this End, He complains of ſuch a People, and exhibits that awful Charge againſt them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.10. <hi>They are not humbled, even unto this Day, neither have they feared. Fear</hi> is ſometimes put for religious Worſhip, and ſometimes for the whole of Religion, but here in my Text, 'tis probable, it may be rather taken for that Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or Affection of the Mind called <hi>Fear.</hi> There ſhould be a holy Fear of GOD and His Wrath, a Trembling at His Judgments: We read, Pſal. 65.8. <hi>They that dwell in the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Parts are afraid at thy Tokens.</hi> The holy Pſalmiſt ſays, Pſal. 119.120. <hi>My Fleſh trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth for Fear of Thee, and I am afraid of thy Judgments.</hi> And the holy Prophet <hi>Habakkuk, Chap.</hi> 3.16. <hi>When I heard, my Belly trembled, my Lips quivered, I trembled in my ſelf.</hi> GOD ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects that we fear, and tremble before Him, under the Apprehenſions of preſent, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending Diſpenſations of His Wrath, but more eſpecially under the Senſe of whatſoever provoking Evils have enkindled His Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and cauſed Him to ſhake His Rod over us. We read, Ezra 9.4. <hi>How they aſſembled every one that trembled at the Words of the Lord,</hi> becauſe of the Tranſgreſſions of His People, and how the <hi>Prophet ſat aſtonied until the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:003015_0017_0FEF9F7CBABC3D58"/>Sacrifice:</hi> And in the <hi>next Chap.</hi> How <hi>all the People ſat in the Houſe of GOD trembling becauſe of this Matter.</hi> So <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Governour, feared</hi> upon the Threatning of a terrible Judgment, and <hi>ſet himſelf to ſeek the Lord, and proclaimed a Faſt throughout all Judab.</hi> When GOD ſends His Judgments they are to excite in us a reveren<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> Fear of Him, and awful Dread of His Wrach. Hence under the Judgments of GOD, that is the Call of GOD unto us, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 8.13. <hi>Sanctify the Lord of hoſts Himſelf, and let Him be your Fear, and let Him be your Dread.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND as the Lord may expect to be <hi>feared,</hi> (for when the <hi>Lyon roars, who will not fear,</hi> we ſhall be more ſtupid than the Beaſts of the Field, if we tremble not,) ſo may He juſtly expect that we <hi>hear and receive Inſtruction</hi> thereby, that we learn to adore and magnify His infinite and almighty Power, together with His undeſerved ſparing Mercy, that we ſee how much it concerns us to make the Lord our Refuge, and to get under the Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of His Wings, that we may not periſh in the Day of His Indignation, that being warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of GOD as <hi>Noah</hi> was, we may prepare an Ark, in which we may be ſaved from being overwhelmed with the Floods of divine Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, that may come down in an horrible Tempeſt upon a wicked World: That we therefore make haſte to CHRIST, that we may have Reſt in ſuch a Day of Trouble. GOD may juſtly expect, that we do in theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:003015_0017_0FEF9F7CBABC3D58"/>
               <hi>Fear Him, and receive Inſtruction.</hi> This is GOD's great End and Deſign in threatning to bring down His awful Judgments on us, and they are a loud Call to all to fear Him, and to tremble at His Preſence; to give Glory to His Name, <hi>to publiſh His Name,</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks, by <hi>aſcribing Praiſe to our GOD,</hi> and then to learn all thoſe Leſſons, ſuch Diſpenſations call us to. GOD has implanted this Affection or Paſſion of the Mind in us, to be exerted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on proper Objects being preſented to us, and all thoſe Diſpenſations that carry Terror in them, may well work upon our Fears, unleſs our Hearts be harder than the Rocks and Mountains that <hi>quake at Him, and are thrown down by Him.</hi> And He has made us capable of receiving Inſtruction, of thinking on our Ways, of <hi>remembring this, and ſhewing our ſelves Men,</hi> unleſs we will be like <hi>the Horſe and Mule which have no Underſtanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE have many deſirable Helps and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages for the knowing our Lord's Mind and Will, if we are truly deſirous of doing it. So then we muſt certainly conclude, That GOD may juſtly expect, that we <hi>fear Him, and receive Inſtruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AFTER He has inflicted any Judgments on us, or threaten'd the Infliction of more and greater, He may well ſay concerning ſuch a People; <hi>Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive Inſtruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I paſs to the third Obſervation.</p>

               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:003015_0018_0FEF9F7F54E1EAB0"/>
               <hi>OBSERV. III.</hi> THAT did we fear the Lord, and receive Inſtruction, we might hope to be ſaved from deſtroying Judgments; ſo that our Dwellings ſhould not be cut off, however otherwiſe GOD might puniſh us.</p>
            <p>WE ſhould by <hi>fearing</hi> the Lord, and <hi>receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Inſtruction</hi> anſwer His righteous Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning us, and ſo remove the Grounds of His Controverſy with us. When GOD brings His Judgments upon a People, or threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens to diſpenſe terrible Things in Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to them, it is becauſe they will not <hi>fear</hi> Him, will not lay His Judgments to Heart, and ſee and own their Sin and Folly in their vile Departures from Him, and therefore He will make them to feel the doleful Effects of His vindictive Wrath: So much we plainly learn from the Tenour of the divine Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings throughout the Book of GOD.</p>
            <p>BUT now if the People of GOD under His Judgments inflicted or threatned, maintain a holy Fear of GOD upon their Hearts, and give to GOD the Glory of His divine Perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions therein diſplay'd, and acknowledge His Sovereignty, Juſtice, and Mercy, in His Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations, and make it their ſollicitous inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>What meaneth the Heat of His Anger? What have I done, and how much have I provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the holy GOD to come out of His Place, and threaten even on utter Deſolation? I will now therefore ſearch and try my Ways, and by the Help of His Grace will now turn unto the Lord, that
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:003015_0018_0FEF9F7F54E1EAB0"/>He may have Mercy upon me, and pardon me, and not execute the Fierceneſs of His Anger.</hi> Were this our great Sollicitude under the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Viſitations of GOD, we ſhould have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Grounds of Hope, that the Lord would ſtay His Hand, and ſpare us, in the Multitude of His tender Mercies; yea, that He woud repent Him of what further Evil He had thought to have brought upon us. Such a repenting and returning GOD, has aſſured us, will keep off, or avert impending Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: Hence after the holy Prophet <hi>Joel</hi> had in terrible Manner ſpake of GOD's utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing His Voice, in the Day that ſhould be <hi>great</hi> and <hi>terrible,</hi> and <hi>none could abide it:</hi> He im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately exhorts in the Name of the Lord, <hi>to turn unto the Lord,</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Joel 2.12, 13, 14.</note> 
               <hi>Therefore alſo now ſaith the Lord, Turn ye even to me with all your Heart, and with Faſting, and with Weeping, and with Mourning, and rent your Hearts, and not your Garments, and turn unto the Lord your GOD: for He is gracious and merciful, ſlow to Anger, and of great Kindneſs, and repenteth Him of the Evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is ſpoken after the Manner of Men, to repreſent how ready the Lord is upon a <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Repentance,</hi> and <hi>thorow Reformation,</hi> to change the Courſe of His Providence towards His People, and not inflict thoſe Judgments, He threatned to bring down upon them; yea, He further ſays, <hi>Then will the Lord be jealous
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:003015_0019_0FEF9F8262E13300"/>for His Land, and pity His People, yea, the Lord will anſwer, Fear not, O Land! Be glad and rejoice, for the Lord will do great Things, and I will pour out my Spirit</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>IN a Word here; GOD has often ſpared His People, upon their thus returning to Him; He has upon their Humiliations and Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions granted them a Reprieve, and ſo He is ready to do ſtill; if we will alſo <hi>fear Him and receive Inſtruction.</hi> Hence we have that Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Lord, Jer. 6.8. <hi>Be thou inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted O Jeruſalem, leſt my Soul depart from thee, leſt I make thee Deſolate, a Land not inhabited.</hi> Be thou <hi>inſtructed</hi> or <hi>corrected,</hi> as it may be read; By the Correction thou haſt felt alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and which is further threatned, be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to repent before it be too late; <hi>Let the Rod and Reproof teach thee Wiſdom.</hi> Nor were they at any Loſs what to do in this Caſe, well knowing what the Lord had ſaid to them by the ſame Prophet, <note n="‖" place="bottom">Ch. 18.7, 8.</note> from which we ſhall ſee the Truth before us further confirmed, <hi>At what Inſtant I ſhall ſpeak concerning a Nation, and concerning a Kingdom, to pluck up and to pull down, and to deſtroy it, If that Nation againſt whom I have pronounced, turn from their Evil, I will repent of the Evil, I thought to do unto them.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>NOTHING can more provoke the holy and righteous GOD to do ſo, than incorrigible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs under His Judgments. And therefore the holy Prophet ſays concerning ſuch, Jer. 5.3. <hi>O Lord, thou haſt ſtricken them, but they have not grieved, thou haſt conſumed them, but they have refuſed to receive Correction, they have made their Faces harder than a Rock, they have refuſed to return,</hi> and then it follows, <hi>He hath poured upon them the Fury of His Anger</hi> &amp;c. If inflicted, or threatned, Calamities don't attain the End for which they are ſent, viz. to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, reform, and do us good, if we will not be reclaim'd, but go on impenitently ſtill, we may fear, that, that will be quickly the Lord's Determination concerning us, Ezek. 24.13. <hi>Becauſe I have purged thee,</hi> i. e. uſed Means for thy Reformation, and thou waſt not reformed, <hi>Thou ſhalt not be purged from thy Filthineſs any more, till I have cauſed my Fury to reſt upon thee.</hi> So GOD told <hi>Moſes,</hi> Deut. 31.16, 17. That if they <hi>brake His Covenant, His Anger ſhould be kindled againſt them, and He would forſake and hide his Face from them, and they ſhould be devoured, and many Evils and Troubles befall them, ſo that they ſhould ſay, Are not all

We read in the 78th <hi>Pſalm,</hi> how <hi>they were a rebellious and ſtubborn Generation, that kept not the Covenant of GOD, and refuſed to walk in His Law,</hi> and notwithſtanding all His marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Appearances for them, yet <hi>ſinned more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Him, by provoking the moſt High in the Wilderneſs: Yea, they ſpake againſt GOD, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord heard this, and was wroth, ſo a Fire was kindled againſt Jacob, and Anger al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo came up againſt Iſrael: The Wrath of GOD came upon them, and ſlew them, He caſt upon them the Fierceneſs of His Anger, Wrath and Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, He made a Way to His Anger, He ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not their Soul from Death, but gave their Life over to the Peſtilence, and ſmote all their Firſt-born;</hi> — But yet, we read again, that <hi>they tempted and provoked the moſt high GOD, and kept not His Teſtimonies, but turned back and dealt unfaithfully like their Fathers, they were turned aſide like a deceitful Bow, they provoked Him to Anger, and moved Him to Jealouſie, when GOD heard this, He was wroth, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abhorred Iſrael; ſo that He forſook their Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, deliver'd their Strength into Captivity, and their Glory into the Enemies Hand, He gave His People over alſo to the Sword, and was wroth with His Inheritance, the Fire conſumed them</hi> &amp;c.</p>

IF you were <hi>prick'd to the Heart,</hi> you would be <hi>going and weeping, and ſeeking the Lord your GOD;</hi> you would pray more, more humbly, earneſtly, and importunately, as well as more frequently for your <hi>Converſion;</hi> and that you might be prepared for all the great Events of Providence, and even for the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Day of GOD.</hi> Yea, you would not let the Lord go until He look down from Heaven with an Eye of Pity on you. You will be never eaſier than when in your <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> ſeeking for the Mercy of GOD to your ſelves, and yours; eſpecially when you can ſolace your own Souls with any comfortable Grounds of Hope GOD has <hi>heard your Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and will not turn away His Mercy from you.</hi> And how can you live with any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, if you have no Hope of this?</p>
               <p>OH that Men would ſeek the Lord, while He may be found, and call upon Him while He is near, and give Glory to GOD before their Feet ſtumble upon the dark Mountains, when all Intreaties for Mercy will be too late!</p>
               <p>IT may be fear'd, that deſolating Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are haſtning upon us, that the <hi>Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants</hi> of the Land, are ripe for them, and it may be, for a deſtroying EARTHQUAKE that ſhall lay ſome Parts of it waſte and deſolare. And ſhall not this awful Conſideration excite and move us to cry for Mercy? GOD ſhakes

                  <hi>How ſhall I give thee up, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim? How ſhall I deliver thee, Iſrael? How ſhall I make thee as Admah? and ſet thee as Zebeim? Mine Heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together, I will not exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Fierceneſs of mine Anger, I will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to deſtroy you.</hi> But verily, if we will not <hi>obey His Voice,</hi> He will <hi>return</hi> in Anger, and more terrible EARTHQUAKES than thoſe of the <hi>laſt Week</hi>

               <p>In looks, at preſent, as if the <hi>Voice</hi> of GOD had not been enough hearkned to, that the Great GOD ſhould ſo continue <hi>roaring</hi> from the <hi>deep Places of the Earth.</hi> He ſeems to be conning nearer to us; and if we ſhall now be viſited as our <hi>Neighbours</hi> in the <hi>Northern</hi> Parts of the <hi>Province</hi> have been, the Lord grant, the like Impreſſions may be made on our Minds, that have on ſuch Numbers there.</p>
               <p>IT may be, we ſhall go on, many of us, in our Diſobedience to the Voice of GOD, and <hi>Conſcience,</hi> till we feel more terrible <hi>Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> of the Earth under us; and we ſhall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>then,</hi> if we don't hear alſo, the <hi>ſtill ſmall Voice</hi> of His Word and Spirit.</p>

METHINKS, I now find my ſelf brought by <hi>the Hand of the Lord, into the midſt of the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, which is full of Bones</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">To allude to Ezek. 37, 1, —12.</note> where there are <hi>many very dry,</hi> and hear the Lord ſaying, <hi>Can theſe Bones live?</hi> To which I make the Anſwer prepar'd for me, <hi>O Lord GOD, thou knoweſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WE have propheſy'd upon theſe <hi>Bones,</hi> and ſaid unto them, <hi>O ye dry Bones, hear the Word of the Lord,</hi> and may the Lord GOD now ſay, unto <hi>theſe Bones, Behold I will cauſe Breath to enter into you, and ye ſhall live, and ye ſhall know that I am the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WHEN we propheſy as we are commanded, May there be <hi>a Noiſe and a Shaking,</hi> and then the <hi>Spirit</hi> of GOD which is the Wind that bloweth where it liſteth, come and <hi>breathe upon theſe Slain, that they may live, and ſtand up upon their Feet an exceeding great Army.</hi> We have reaſon to pray, and hope for it.</p>
               <p>LET none then, now ſay, eſpecially ſuch as are under Convictions, <hi>Our Bones are dried, and our Hope is loſt, we are cut off, for our Parts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>TO conclude,</hi> LET us now hear the Word of the Lord, unto us, in Jer. 13.15, 16. <hi>Hear ye and give ear, Be not proud: for the Lord hath ſpoken, Give Glory to the Lord your GOD,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:003015_0028_0FEF9F99E320E798"/>before be cauſe Darkneſs, and before your Feet ſtumble upon the dark Mountains, and while ye look for Light, He turn it into the Shadow of Death, and make it groſs Darkneſs.</hi> And that Word alſo, in Mal. 2.2. <hi>If ye will not bear, and will not lay it to Heart, to give Glory unto any Name, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, I will even ſend a Curſe upon you, and I will curſe your Bleſſings:</hi> We truſt GOD has not yet ſaid, and Oh that He never may, as in the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the <hi>Verſe, Yea, I have curſed them alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, becauſe ye do not lay it to Heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſhut up all</hi> with that <hi>Exhortation,</hi> in Heb. 12. from the 25th Verſe to the End. <hi>See that ye rofuſe not Him that ſpeaketh; for if they eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped not who refuſed him that ſpake on Earth, much more ſhall not we eſcape, if we turn away from Him that ſpeaketh from Heaven: Whoſe Voice then ſhook the Earth, but now He hath promiſed, ſaying, yet once more, I ſhake not the Earth only, but alſo Heaven. And this Word yet once more, ſignifieth the removing of thoſe Things that are ſhaken, as of Things that are made, that thoſe Things which cannot be ſhaken may remain. Wherefore, we receiving a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which cannot be moved, let us have Grace, whereby we may ſerve GOD acceptably, with Reverence, and GODLY FEAR. FOR OUR GOD IS A CONSUMING FIRE.</hi>
