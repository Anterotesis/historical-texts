            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>BUT this I confeſs unto thee, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the way which they call Hereſy, ſo worſhip I the God of my Fathers.</hi>
For to this Effect was the Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of one, when he was had before the Rulers. It ſeems that there were in ancient Days that were accounted Hereticks, and yet according to what we find written in the Word of Truth, were the true Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of God. May you all that are here preſent become ſuch, is the deſire of my Soul. Let Men account of you whatever they may, yet if you are thoſe true Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers of God, you will not be aſhamed to confeſs it before the Children of Men; tho' you may be ſcorn'd and abus'd; when you are ſenſible that you are thoſe that worſhip God, and are right, will not be

backward. But if it ſhould ſo happen, that you come to be Sufferers, and to be had before the Rulers, and to be falſly accuſed in divers reſpects, as the Followers of Chriſt were in the Apoſtles Days yet dare not to deny that you are the Worſhippers of God. And we find Chriſt our bleſſed Lord, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> at <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Well, which way to worſhip God, and let us ſee that we are found in this way, is acceptable to God, in our Worſhip and Service unto him this Day, and all our Days, that we may have the Spirit, and then no Queſtion at all, but when it ſhall pleaſe God to put a Period to our Days here, we ſhall find acceptance with him: For though we may be rejected by the Children of Men, and ſlighted, and ill uſed, yet thoſe that are found true worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of God, let them go under what Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination whatſoever, they ſhall find accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. And indeed in their Offerings unto the Lord, he will in no wiſe reject them that are fearers of God, and workers of Righteouſneſs, whatſoever their Names may be, for God is no reſpecter of Perſons, but all Nations that work Righteouſneſs ſhall be accepted by him. May you and I be
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:003028_0006_0FEFAE6485F129F8"/>
of this Number, and in order to that we ought to wait upon God, for what are we as the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>of our ſelves we can do nothing,</hi> unleſs we are abilitated by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God; that we may keep to it and wait for it. And it is the deſire of my Soul, although many of the Children of Men ſo ſcandalize it, that People wait for the Spirit of God, and they dare not Preach, and they dare not Pray, untill they feel and are abilitated by his Power Divine, for we know not how to Pray as we ought, but the Spirit in us with ſighs and groanings, that may not be heard by Mortals, being yet Divine; but he hears, and he knows, and he knows in whoſe Heart it is to Fear and to Serve him. I hope there is a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber though ſmall, a number gather'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that are deſirous to worſhip the Lord in their Days and Generations.</p>
            <p>But as I ſaid before of the Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> by <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Well; when we find our bleſſed Lord came to her, at that ſame time we may find that they fell into a Caſe, or as it were a Diſcourſe about the worſhip of God and the like. And he inform'd her as we may read, if I'm not miſtaken, in the fourth Chapter of <hi>John,</hi> that the true
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:003028_0007_0FEFAE6620AE4D70"/>
Worſhippers ſhould worſhip the Father, in Spirit and in Truth, and ſuch was God ſeeking to worſhip Him: He further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd her of all that ever ſhe had done, and ſhe went away convinced, that it was our bleſſed Lord and Saviour; and ſhe was made to make ſome Publication of it, and ſhe went away. —<hi>And come ſee a Man that told me all that ever I did.</hi> Well, ſhe ſeem'd to be in earneſt, and invites and many Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd, not only becauſe of her ſaying it, but they went and ſaw for themſelves. Now what we invite the Children of Men to, is to make ſome proof, and come and ſee for themſelves, if they have not ſomething that will be of force unto them all; they will have the Spirit, and he will Inſtruct them for that end. They have had a Spirit that has been contrary to the Divine Will and Pleaſure of God; for he indeed does ſhow unto Men and Women, what influences them in order that they may forſake the evil of it; and ceaſe to do evil and learn to do well. And although their Souls have been as Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, and as deep Crimſon, yet upon ceaſing to do evil, and learning to do well, he will waſh them as white as Snow, and as Wool: may we all come to be waſh'd, from the evil
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:003028_0008_0FEFAE6B07B298A8"/>
of our doings; for we muſt confeſs we have all ſinned, as the Apoſtle ſays, and come ſhort of the Glory of God. Therefore this Remnant have apply'd themſelves to the great Phyſician, who is willing to pardon the Children of Men, and to blot out their Iniquities; and now being waſhed, and now being cleanſed, and now being ſanctified, for as we may read in the Scriptures of Truth, <hi>know ye not that no unrighteous one ſhall inherit God's Kingdom.</hi> And he reckons up, Evil-doers, Idolaters, Effeminate, and Adulterers, yet ſays he, <hi>ſuch were ſome of you:</hi> But yet, had the Lord mercy on ſuch, that were not fit for his kingdom? Yes, <hi>for now are ye waſhed, and now are ye cleanſed,</hi> &amp;c. Here was a ſpiritual work manifeſted unto them, and we muſt come to, and now being clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and now being born of the Spirit, and now being born of Water, and now being cleanſed, otherwiſe we ſhall never be fit for God's kingdom, according to the foregoing Chapter, as we may read in the 3d. of <hi>John,</hi> Our bleſſed Lord inform'd <hi>Nichodemus</hi> that was a Ruler, and that came to Jeſus by night, if I miſtake not he inform'd him, and told him that <hi>unleſs a Man was born again, he cou'd not ſee the kingdom of God. How can this be?</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:003028_0009_0FEFAE6E40503728"/>
ſaith <hi>Nichodemus, Can a Man enter a ſecond time into his Mothers Womb</hi>? It ſeems he was carnally minded, and apply'd the ſpeech of our bleſſed Lord carnally, and then he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther explains it, <hi>Except a Man be born of Water, and of the Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. Now I believe many have had the Work of the Spirit of God on their Hearts, as well as he; May we all apply our ſelves to him for all our Doubts, that he would teach us the way we ſhould walk in, and if we do, he will no doubt dicover to every individual of us what way we may come to be born again.</p>
            <p>I confeſs my ſelf I had my Education a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe called Quakers, yet when the Lord was pleas'd by his great mercy to viſit me, and to bring me under a concern to know what I ſhou'd do to inherit eternal life; I was ready to ſubmit to every thing that I was made to know was my Duty, and if it was any outward Ceremony my Parents came ſhort of, yet I knew I muſt do my work my ſelf: thus when I read that paſſage of our bleſſed Lord to <hi>Nichodemus,</hi> I was ready to ſubmit to the Ceremony of Water, which can only waſh the outward Man, from hence 'twas practic'd from him, and it was the ſame that had done it, and thoſe that
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:003028_0010_0FEFAE7171AD8B68"/>
were commanded to do it took it from Chriſt: And thus I was for ſome time, and apply'd my ſelf unto God that I might not miſs of the ſalvation of my Soul. And I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire none to take up Religion from Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of what Form ſoever, but that we may know of our being fitted for God's king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, perhaps we ſhall never be fit for his kingdom. I hope there are many of the Children of Men thus informed, and as you keep up that appearance you have in your ſelves, although ſome times it ſeems very ſmall, even like a grain of Muſtard-ſeed, yet if you have Faith in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt which teacheth you at times and ſeaſons, to deny all ungodlineſs and luſts of the World. We find the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was very poſitive when he wrote to <hi>Titus,</hi> and ſays, <hi>the grace of God which bringeth ſalvation, hath appeared unto all Men,</hi> he will's not the Death of a Sinner, but had rather that he turn and live, and the good Spirit of God teacheth you <hi>to deny worldly luſts, and to live ſoberly, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly, and godly</hi>; may you keep the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of it, you need no teaching but the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anointing in you, teacheth you, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is that we call upon the Children of Men, and invite them to come and ſee and
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:003028_0011_0FEFAE73F1D80E38"/>
live. I remember I ſaw one that was very ancient in years &amp; ſtricken, &amp; he had lived to that time he had loſt his ſight, and he had a viſitation, and he expreſs'd himſelf a little before his departure, He was not one that made Profeſſion with us as a People, yet he humbled himſelf before the Lord, and was made to poſſeſs the Sins of his Youth, and all that ever he had done was brought to his remembrance. I wiſh the Children of Men would conſider, and apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to God for mercy, and not juſtify themſelves in any thing ſhort of a Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the ſight of God. I have known ſuch a one, and I hope and believe there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that have apply'd themſelves to God; I can ſay, that while I ſpeak unto you, I have applyed my ſelf unto the Lord; the Lord have mercy on me, the Lord waſh me, and make me clean. I was ſenſible he was to lead me by his judgments, and as I waited on the Lord I can ſay, that it was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the Lord when I was made ſenſible, that when the wicked Man that has liv'd unrighteouſly, turns from his unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, all his wickedneſs that he hath done ſhall not be remember'd. I vow my ſpirit was humbled before the Lord, and many
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:003028_0012_0FEFAE758E103840"/>
times when I am employed my ſelf in the Aſſemblies of God's People, I was deſirous of God the Lord to ſearch me and to prove me: It was the language of a good Man in ancient Days, that God would ſearch him and try him. And although they may be accounted Hereticks, and the way they Worſhip call'd Hereſy, yet I find for I can ſay it is not my manner, to prepare any thing for to deliver to any People, but to wait on the Lord, and this Paſſage of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture came into my Remembrance, how that one made a Profeſſion, in the way which they called Hereſy.</p>
            <p>And becauſe you be thoſe that thus wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the God of your Fathers, I believe that many have been godly concerned, when they have believed that they might wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God acceptably. And I am glad I can ſay to ſee you thus but ſome who frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come to ſcoff in Deriſion, and mocking, yet bleſſed be the Name of the Lord the Lord will viſit, and influence the Children of Men, and will not lay unto their charge that they may be ignorant. I remember the Apoſtle <hi>Stephen</hi> when he was ſtoned, and perſecuted; there was a Spirit in him, &amp; he pray'd, <hi>Lord, lay not this Sin unto their charge,</hi>

And I have charitable Thoughts that ſome have been ignorant, and hardly knew what they did, yet bleſſed be the Lord Truth does ſpread, and is predominant: And if you do as thoſe that are Profeſſors ought to do, do but live anſwerable to your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, according to the influence of the Light you make a Profeſſion of, you will be as Way-marks to the Children of Men. For we are People that make a Profeſſion of the Light of Jeſus Chriſt, that has light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every Man that has come into the World, though ſome ſay it was inſufficient, but the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſays it was not inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient; but the Grace of God, he might have ſaid the Light of Chriſt, hath appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto all Men; and what did it diſcover? why it teacheth them to deny all Ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and worldly Luſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> May you keep the teachings of it, and may I, is the deſire of my Soul, whenſoever we appear before the Lord. May we call upon him, and breath unto him, that he would abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate us, to perform acceptable Service unto him; ſo I deſire for my own Soul that I may thus worſhip God aright, which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd in Spirit and in Truth, as I have mention'd before, for God ſeeks, ſuch to
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:003028_0014_0FEFAE7A46C1DBC0"/>
Worſhip him in this latter Age, as well as when his Son was upon the Earth, in that Body prepared by the Father to do his Will, and I am ſenſible that there is a Remnant here at this time, deſirous to wait upon him and cry unto him, that he would abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate them to Worſhip him. That they may acceptably Worſhip him, is not only to bow the Head, but it is to bow the Heart to; and I muſt confeſs <hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen</hi>
Worſhiped the Lord, when ſhe waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Feet with her Tears, and wiped them with her Hairs. There was great Love in her Heart to her Saviour that had Mercy on her, and indeed where is much forgiven there is great Love. Do you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the kindneſs and goodneſs of God unto you, he has ſtrengthned you daily, and he has ſtrived with you as with <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, O Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, thou that killeſt the Prophets, how often would I have gather'd you but you would not.</hi> Friends, the Mercy of God was extended in a large degree unto them, and ſo it has been unto the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>New-England,</hi> may not you requite Evil for Good, but cry unto him that he might prepare you that you might ſerve, to prepare your Hearts that you may ſerve
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:003028_0015_0FEFAE0A753F06F8"/>
to Worſhip him acceptably in your Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations: For indeed ſome Men may meet with difficulties which they are not aware of in Duty, though it has been thus that many have had wherewithal, and have been thus, and have had free liberty to worſhip and ſerve the Lord according to their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions; yet we know not how the Lord may work, and what overturnings may come. We have to bleſs the Name of the Lord, that he has thus wrought for the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of his People, by his Spirit. I deſire my Brethren, and Siſters, in all humility be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, to reverence him and to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that he has thus order'd, and has thus work'd on the Hearts of thoſe in Authority, that we have free liberty to work towards our Maker. I can tell you it has ſometimes humbled me, and that ſometimes when my Head has been upon my Pillow, to God that has thus wrought: May we offer unto him, the Sacrifices of a broken Heart, and of a contrite Spirit, which he will not deſpiſe.</p>

            <head>Part of a Second Diſcourſe, Delivered the ſame Day, By <hi>another Friend.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>I Would in Charity hope, and do believe, that the Intent and Deſigns of our Mind generally is; I ſpeak unto ſuch as are come unto Years of underſtanding, we all intend one way, and the Intent of our Minds ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally is, that, when the Period of time, ſhall be put unto us, and unto our being here, to enjoy a Heavenly Inheritance; I ſay, I cannot chooſe but in Charity thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, thus all deſign undoubtedly, and ſince the Caſe is ſo, that we are deſign'd one way in our judgments and thoughts, that is at laſt to obtain Heaven and Happineſs, let our Names be what it will, and let your
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:003028_0017_0FEFAE806B0E4B08"/>
Forms of Religion be what they will, I make no doubt but this is your deſign for all. We are all undoubtedly of this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, although I muſt confeſs, that various is the judgments of the Children of Men to obtain it. You are ſenſible Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, of you, I am ſpeaking to, I make no doubt, and therefore you can aſſent to what I ſay in this reſpect, I make no queſtion at all.</p>
            <p>And indeed I muſt confeſs to, that it is commendable for all the Children of Men to be thus engaged, conſidering the ſad loſs, all of us ſhall light of that miſs this fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Happineſs. We are of this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion no doubt, and we believe that Woe will be the Portion of thoſe that miſs of this end; and therefore it is the wiſdom of all the Children of Men, that deſign to take wiſe ſteps to obtain this: for I will tell you Friends, that all that have had experience in this Travail, and all that are Witneſſes, and all that have had any aſſurance of a better World, they have had no ſmall exerciſe here; it has been a narrow Path though all have travail'd in it, that have come to any aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of this glorious inheritance. And therefore I would have us be engaged in this as much as in us lies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:003028_0018_0FEFAE8538FDEB88"/>On the other hand, though we cannot ſee alike in ſundrys, and agree in ſundrys, yet for all that we may dare to maintain Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity unto one another, ſo far as truth will allow. I can truly ſay, I envy no Man that cannot ſee as I do, I pity all that I ſee out of the way, and my Soul mourns many times for them, I am far from having any bitter ſpirit againſt any Man, for ſince the Caſe is ſo to all that miſs this way, it will be enough for them, to miſs what they expected in another World: And it is pity, that any ſhould be ſo malicious, againſt thoſe that cannot ſay with them, for they are ſenſible Men as I ſaid before, and he muſt have ſome ground for his Belief. For I muſt tell you Friends, I don't value that Belief that has no grounds or reaſons for it, for I know very well that Men muſt believe, according to that Belief that is forced into them; for true Belief does ariſe from the Divine Convictions in the Soul, and from the Divine ſight. And therefore it is very hard for Men to bear hard one upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, becauſe they cannot ſee alike, for I am ſenſible that what moſt Men have differ'd moſt about, has been ſince the want
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:003028_0019_0FEFAE86C448E898"/>
of the Spirit, and ſince the Apoſtacy, and ſince the Church has gone away, and ſince it went into the Wilderneſs. It has been about light things in themſelves, and it has not been about the life of Religion. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have been ſo zealous as to kill one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother about Religion, and ſome of them have been only about the outward things in Religion, as you may read in ancient Hiſtory. You know this very well, and it may be better than I can tell you; yet I have had ſome conſiderable ſhare in the Church-Hiſtory, and I have obſerved that it has been commonly, that the difference has been about ſhadows that would not ſave Men, and that Men might be ſaved without, and therefore I would deſcend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a conſideration with you now, about theſe ſhadows that Men have been ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned about, and therefore I ſhall conſider the Thirtieth Chapter of <hi>Jeremiah, The Lord ſaith by the Mouth of his Prophet, behold the day is come ſaith the Lord, and I will make a new Covenant with the Houſe of Iſrael, and with the Houſe of Judah, not according to the Covenant that I made with their Fathers in the Wilderneſs, which Covenant they broke.</hi>
And here you ſee what he ſays, <hi>I will write
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:003028_0020_0FEFAE89CF18D288"/>
my Law in their Hearts, and put it in their inward parts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You are Men that read the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and what this Covenant is, the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> tells us, in the 9th. Chapter, which ſtood only in Meats, and Drinks, and divers Waſhings, and carnal Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: And here you ſee it was a new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that was to be made; the firſt was that that conſiſted in the Ten Precepts, written and engraven in Stone, and was carry'd into the Ark in the Wilderneſs, in that Ark was the firſt Covenant. It was an external out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Covenant, a Covenant of works, and therefore the Lord ſaith, <hi>Behold the day is come, and I will make a new Covenant with the Houſe of Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c. I believe that this was the Goſpel Diſpenſation that was there pointed out in this new Covenant, and I ſuppoſe that all agree in this Goſpel Day that we are under the Goſpel Diſpenſation. That, that was written and engraven on Stone you ſee that was done away, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the firſt Miniſtration. But the ſecond was the Miniſtration of Righteouſneſs, and exceeded the ſame in glory. Therefore the new Covenant is that I would a little ſpeak
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:003028_0021_0FEFAE8D6540DD80"/>
to, that you may know where this muſt be if ever you are acquainted with it: you muſt come to this new Covenant and well where is it, the Apoſtle tells you in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Chapter. He was writing to the Church, and he writes unto them after this manner; <hi>Ye are our Epiſtle, read and known of all Men,</hi> &amp;c. Not the Tables of Stone as the firſt Covenant was, but the fleſhly Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the Heart, is now I believe this new Diſpenſation where the Covenant is, for God will write his Law on their Hearts, and they ſhall not ſay every one to his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and to his Brother, <hi>know ye the Lord? for ye ſhall all know me even from the leaſt unto the greateſt, ſaith the Lord, and I will teach them of my ways.</hi> And here the Lord becomes a Teacher unto his People under the Goſpel Diſpenſation.</p>
            <p>But I will return a little again unto, what the Author ſays unto the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> this firſt Covenant conſiſted in divers Meats, and Waſhings, and carnal Ordinances, that is in carnal Ordinances impoſed on the Children of Men, until the time of the Reformation.
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:003028_0022_0FEF96F266FE25B0"/>
Well Friends, I believe that the firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in point of Obligation is done away in Chriſt Jeſus. He blotted out the Hand, writing of Ordinances, and he took it out of the way and nail'd it unto his Croſs, yea the firſt Covenant of Ordinances ceaſed there; for you know that what, is nailed is commonly ſuppoſed to be faſtned, and to be fixed, and to be deſigned to ſtay there. This firſt Covenant did conſiſt in outward perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, but this conſiſts in a more Heavenly and Spiritual ſubſtance, for I will tell you Friends, all the Ordinances of God, inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God under this firſt Covenant, were very noble Figures, and Shadows: nay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Goſpel was preached; by theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Waſhings and carnal Ordinances. For I ſuppoſe you will confeſs that there was no Remiſſion of Sin, nor Supplication by theſe, for the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>that it was impoſſible for the blood of Bulls, and Goats, and the aſhes of an Heifer to purge away Sin,</hi> there was no Waſhing by theſe that were but legal Purifications, they did not waſh the Souls of Men, for that was repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by theſe outward Signs and Figures under that Diſpenſation, and therefore I
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:003028_0023_0FEFAE8F37F52E18"/>
believe during the time of that legal Diſpenſation, it was neceſſary for theſe things which were a Pattern.</p>
