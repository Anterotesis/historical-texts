            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <bibl>Iſt. Epiſtle C O R. 6th Chap. 9, 10, 11, verſes.</bibl>
               <q>Know ye not that the Unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither Fornicators, nor Idolaters, nor Adulterers, nor Effeminate, nor Abuſers of themſelves with Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, nor Thieves, nor Covetous, nor Drunkards, nor Revilers, nor Extortioners, ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God.—And ſuch were ſome of you: But ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified, but ye are juſtified in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE Apoſtle Paul was, through the bleſſing of God, inſtrumental of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great things at Corinth. It a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded in wealth, and this furniſhed the means for all kinds of luxury; and moſt heinous and deteſtable vices were very prevalent among them. The Apoſtle, who was zealouſly ſet for the promoting the cauſe of his beloved Lord and Maſter, came to this city, being encouraged by a viſion he had, aſſuring him that God <hi>had much people in that city,</hi> Acts 18. 9, 10. When he came, as infamous as they were for vice, yet it is likely, that he met with good accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance among them, and accordingly he made a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable tarry <hi>a year and ſix months teaching the word of God among them,</hi> as in the verſe following.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:011707_0004_0F881EB09EBA6CB0"/>
By his great pains and labours, he was inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of founding a church of Chriſt in that wicked place, and bringing about a great reformation in it. Indeed, notwithſtanding all he did, there were yet many things amiſs among them, for which he takes occaſion in the run of this epiſtle to reprove them.</p>
            <p>In the chapter in which is our text, as well as the preceeding, he warns them againſt divers heinous ſins—<hi>hypocriſy, fornication, idolatry, covetouſneſs, railery, drunkenneſs, extortion, proſecuting others needleſly and vexatiouſly in the law..</hi> With reſpect to ſome among them, theſe vices were ſtill indulged, notwithſtanding they were directly oppoſite to the ſpirit of chriſtianity, which he had been preaching among them, and inculcating upon them. To en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the warning he had given againſt theſe vices, he adds as in the words I at firſt read.—<hi>Know ye not, that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God?</hi> And then he immediately enumer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates divers great and moſt heinous iniquities, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence of which would effectually exclude them the kingdom of God.—The heavenly kingdom, or the kingdom of glory, which God has prepared for the righteous, and into which their gracious ſpirits aſcend in the day of death, and into which Jeſus Chriſt will publickly invite them in their whole man, at the laſt day, ſaying unto them—<hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world,</hi> Matt. 25. 34—This is the kingdom that the apoſtle intends, when he tells the Corinthians, that <hi>the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the kingdom of God.</hi> By the caveat, the apoſtle enters here, it looks as though there were ſome among them, at leaſt, who imagined, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:011707_0005_0F881EB15ECB9B20"/>
their indulging to ſuch iniquities, yet that on the whole they ſhould inherit that kingdom. But, ſays he, <hi>be not deceived,</hi> do not flatter yourſelves in this matter, do not entertain a thought of going to the kingdom of heaven, if you live in unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, or in any of theſe inſtances of unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>fornication, idolatry, adultery,</hi> &amp;c. It is the grandeſt deluſion and ſelf-deception that can be, to entertain the leaſt thought or expectation of being admitted to ſo glorious a happineſs, at the cloſe of an unrighteous, ungodly life. Before I proceed any further, I would remark here—That it is no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common thing, for unrighteous perſons to deceive themſelves, that they ſhall on the whole inherit the kingdom of God; though they indulge themſelves in the moſt heinous and deteſtable abominations, ſuch as are enumerated in our text, they flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they ſhall be happy at laſt. With re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to ſome indeed, God is not in all their tho'ts; and the ſame may be ſaid, with reſpect to a ſtate of future rewards and puniſhments. Theſe great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alities are baniſhed far away from their minds.</p>
            <p>But others may at times have ſome thoughts of God, and of heaven and hell. And yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding by their heinous vices, they are <hi>treaſuring up wrath againſt the day of wrath,</hi> poſting head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to deſtruction. Yet ſuch is their amazing ſtupidity, that they entertain a hope, that it ſhall be well with them upon the whole, that they ſhall go to that heavenly kingdom which God has prepared and promiſed to the righteous. And wherefore is it, that they entertain ſuch a hope? Why, it is partly owing to this, that they imagine that God takes no notice of their conduct and behaviour, or that
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:011707_0006_0F881EB21EC87288"/>
he connives at it, ſo making him altogether ſuch an one as themſelves. And partly, becauſe they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that God is made up wholly of mercy, and that therefore, he will not at laſt find it in his heart to puniſh them; that he will ſet aſide his juſtice, and diſpenſe with the threatnings which he has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt the wicked, eſpecially as there is an alſufficient Saviour of his own providing, and a ſufficiency of merit in his blood to pardon and ſave them; and conſidering alſo, that he is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to pardon ſinners, and that many great and high-handed ſinners have been the ſubjects of his pardoning mercy. The ſelf-deception of ſinners, chargeable oftentimes with moſt heinous and atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious crimes, is no doubt, in a great many inſtances, grounded upon ſuch imaginations as theſe.</p>
            <p>But that theſe are vain imaginations, is obvious at the very firſt glance.—I might ſhow at large, would the time admit of it, that God is abſolutely and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily omniſcient, and conſequently that every being and every thing, throughout the whole uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, is naked and open to his view; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, that he has a moſt exact and critical know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, without the leaſt miſtake, or indeed poſſibility of it, of men and all their thoughts, words and actions. You may, at your leiſure, ſee in confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of what I have now ſaid, the 139th Pſalm, at the beginning.—I might ſhow alſo that God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infinitely and immutably holy, cannot poſſibly connive at ſin, the leaſt ſin, for this would be to connive at that which directly ſtrikes at his glorious crown and dignity, that pours contempt upon his authority and law, and upon all his adorable attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes. Sin is directly oppoſite to his nature, law
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:011707_0007_0F881EB2DEB8FD80"/>
and government. And what ſort of idea muſt we entertain of God, if we ſhould ſuppoſe that he in the leaſt connived at it, or was indifferent about it? Verily that is a clear dictate of reaſon as well as of the Bible that <hi>he is of purer eyes than to behold ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi>—And further, although it is true, that God is infinite in mercy, and has given the moſt glorious proofs and evidences hereof to mankind, yet it is true alſo, that he is infinite in his juſtice, and that this ſtands upon the rights of his throne, and for the maintenance of his righteous authority and his holy law, inviolate. This is abundantly evident, in the whole of that great affair <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the redemption of the world by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>In the death and ſacrifice of that glorious perſon, we have a moſt ſtriking proof of the ſtrict regard God had for the honor of his juſtice, and this at the ſame time that his mercy had the moſt ſhining, il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious diſplay; mercy for ever to be admir'd and ador'd by ſaints and angels. Mercy rejoic'd againſt judgment in providing ſuch a glorious Saviour, as the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is, and ſo putting ſinners in a capacity of being ſaved; yet it is a vain imagination for any ſinners to think, that God will ſet aſide his juſtice, and ſuffer the glory of this perfection to be eclipſed, ſo as that they ſhall be the ſubjects of his mercy either here or hereafter, they continuing in their unrighteouſneſs, counteracting his law and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, by their vicious practices. And ſo I may ſay further, that Chriſt is a mighty redeemer, able to ſave to the uttermoſt, yet <hi>he gave himſelf,</hi> or offered himſelf in ſacrifice, that he might redeem ſinners <hi>from</hi> their ſins, from the power, pollution and guilt of ſin, as well as from the penal effects of it.
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:011707_0008_0F881EB39EB6BF48"/>
Conſequently then, they can have no benefit by his death and ſacrifice, if they are not redeemed from iniquity, in the manner now ſaid. And certainly, they are not thus redeemed, if they live in the practice of iniquity. Nothing can be more plain than this.—And I will only add in a word here—That ſinners that have obtained mercy from God, and looked for his mercy unto eternal life, have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it, not as hardned ſinners, bent upon their ungodly practices, but as qualified ſubjects of it, receiving the ſprinkling of the blood of Jeſus, and the ſanctification of the holy Spirit. So that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further enlarging here—It is with good reaſon, that the apoſtle declares in our text, that <hi>the unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſhall not inherit the kingdom of God,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly enters a caution to all unrighteous ones, and eſpecially thoſe he here enumerates, againſt ſelf-deception: <hi>Be not deceived,</hi> for no unrighteous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhall inherit the kingdom of God.</p>
            <p>Now here let me aſk, what it is that gives a title to the kingdom of God? Verily, not any thing in the creature; for in himſelf he is utterly unworthy. The moſt improved chriſtian, has no title to heaven, and the bleſſedneſs of it, upon the foundation of his own perſonal righteouſneſs. If he attains to ever ſo high degrees in holineſs and righteouſneſs, yet after all he is an unprofitable ſervant. Let him be as eminent a chriſtian as was the apoſtle Paul, yet he has no claim upon God, and may not pretend to any title to heavenly happineſs. Conſidering the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of perſonal righteouſneſs in the very beſt, it is impoſſible, according to the conſtitution of God's moral government, that ſuch a righteouſneſs can give a title to the heavenly kingdom. The truth
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:011707_0009_0F881EB45EBFDB50"/>
is, that nothing ſhort of the perfect righteouſneſs of our bleſſed Saviour, which is imputed to the real chriſtian, can give a title to the heavenly kingdom and glory.</p>
            <p>The proof of this, I might go on abundantly to confirm, were it neceſſary at preſent. Now then, what ſhall we ſay of the unrighteous? What title can they pretend to the heavenly kingdom, when they are, not only without the imputed righteouſneſs of Chriſt, but have not ſo much as a perſonal righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs to produce and plead in the caſe? They are without God and without Chriſt in the world. What title then can they have to the kingdom of heaven? And what an abſurd thing muſt it be in ſuch, to entertain the leaſt expectation of finally being admitted thereinto? The impoſſibility of their being ſo, at once appears from the bare mentioning of the caſe. I would aſk further—What it is that gives a meetneſs for that kingdom? God that dwelleth there is holy; angels are holy; all the inhabitants of it are holy; the exerciſes and employments thereof are all holy; and, as it is written, <hi>Without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord,</hi> Heb. 12. 14. Unholy ones are utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the holy God: There is as much contrariety in their natures, to the nature of God, as there is between light and darkneſs: <hi>And what communion hath light with darkneſs?</hi> An unholy perſon, could we ſuppoſe that ſuch an one could be admitted to heaven at laſt, could have no true enjoyment of the holy God. For likeneſs to God is eſſentially neceſſary, in order to the enjoyment of God. Being unholy, a creature could have no taſte or reliſh for the fellowſhip and ſociety of holy angels,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:011707_0010_0F881EB51EC8C878"/>
or for their exerciſes and employments. Heaven, t o unholy ones, would be a confinement to them, and they would even wiſh they were out of it, there being ſuch an utter unlikeneſs to every thing there, ſuch an utter diſreliſh to every object and every exerciſe there. If now upon the whole here, unrighteous, unholy ones, have no meetneſs or fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for the heavenly kingdom, what wretched ſelf-deception is it in ſuch, to entertain the leaſt thought or expectation of at laſt being received thereinto? And were they to conſider what heaven is, the objects, the ſociety, the employments and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of it, it ſeems as though none of this character, and while continuing in this ſtate, could entertain the leaſt thought of going there at laſt. But they have, it is likely in many inſtances, carnal notions of it, as though it was nothing more than a fine ſplendid city, furniſhed with objects adapted to gratify the animal ſenſes, having no higher ideas of it, than of a mahometan paradiſe. But let their imaginations be what they will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let their expectations of attaining to it be ever ſo ſanguine, yet it may be depended upon, if any dependance may be placed upon what the apoſtle declares in our text, that <hi>ſuch ſhall not inherit the kingdom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now ſomething more is intended by the apoſtle in this declaration, than is expreſſed. He intends not only that they ſhall be excluded the kingdom of glory, but that they ſhall be doomed to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of darkneſs. This will unavoidably be their caſe. Abundance of paſſages in the book of God might be produced were there need of it, which fully declare that the unrighteous ſhall at laſt be ſhut up in the priſon of hell. And there they will endure
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:011707_0011_0F881EB5DEAF7800"/>
the wrath of God, yea, the exceeding fierceneſs of the wrath of almighty God, through a long eternity. There they will be companions with devils, who now entice them and hurry them on in wickedneſs, with the malicious view of bringing them to their place of torments. There they will, as do the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, blaſpheme the God of heaven, and gnaw their tongues for pain, without the leaſt reſpite, the leaſt gleam of hope, or ray of light. When millions of millions of ages are rolled away, in which they have been grapling and conflicting with the exceeding fierceneſs of the wrath of omnipotent God, ſtill there is a long, boundleſs eternity before them, and they are no nearer to an end of their torments, than the very moment they entred upon them. This will be the miſerable condition at laſt of the unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous. It is impoſſible to deſcribe, or even to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a ten thouſandth part of their future miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs and wretchedneſs in the bottomleſs pit; and this, notwithſtanding all the ſolemn and ſtriking re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations we have of it in the word of God.—<hi>Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thy fear, ſo is thy wrath.</hi> It exceeds all the moſt fearful apprehenſions, that may at any time be entertained of it. This wrath is moſt aſſuredly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon all the children of diſobedience. God will come at laſt to ſhew his wrath and make his power known, in the ſight of all intelligencies, upon ſuch veſſels of wrath, as have fitted themſelves for deſtruction. All thoſe heinous ſinners the apoſtle mentions in our text, <hi>fornicators, adulterers, thieves, drunkards,</hi> &amp;c. ſhall have their portion at laſt in the lake which burneth with fire and brimſtone, which is the ſecond death. Not a ſingle one ſhall eſcape, however any may flatter themſelves now that they ſhall do ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:011707_0012_0F881EB69EB04AF0"/>
I would juſt obſerve here—That there are many, who, though they may not ſtand chargeable with ſuch groſs open iniquities as the text leads us to conſider, yet, properly come under the character of the unrighteous. Although their outward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct may be decent before men, yea although in many inſtances, they may practiſe the forms of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, yet they are without the power of it; they have a name to live, but are dead, under the power of carnal minds that are enmity againſt God, falſe and hypocritical in all their tranſactions with him, have never had any real, thorough ſenſe of ſin, nor godly mourning for it. In ſhort, their hearts are eſtranged from God, they are earthly and ſenſual in their diſpoſitions and affections. Such as theſe, though they may make a goodly appearance before the world, are yet in the ſight of the holy and heart-ſearching God, <hi>unrighteous.</hi> And with reſpect to theſe alſo it may be ſaid, that they ſhall not inherit the kingdom of God. No unclean, unholy thing ſhall enter there. <hi>All unrighteouſneſs is ſin,</hi> ſays the apoſtle, 1 John 5. 17. This takes in thoſe, that I have now mentioned. And as it is elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſaid, <hi>Sin is the tranſgreſſion of the law,</hi> eternal death is the penalty annexed to this law. And this penalty will be inflicted upon all the unrighteous at laſt. All theſe things ſtand in cloſe connection with each other. And accordingly, <hi>The wrath of God is revealed from heaven, againſt all the ungodlineſs and unrighteouſneſs of men,</hi> Rom. 1. 18. Againſt <hi>all</hi> unrighteouſneſs, whether ſecret or open. And far be it from any to fix the charge of cruelty upon God, in inflicting his everlaſting wrath upon unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, ungodly ones. For it will not be a mere act of power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but he will proceed upon the rules of ſtrict
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:011707_0013_0F881EB75ED259B0"/>
juſtice. Unrighteous ones are enemies againſt his great and ſacred majeſty, they do the abominable thing which his ſoul hates; they counteract his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and holy law, and virtually bid him defiance. They break through the moſt ſacred ties of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, for his abundant goodneſs and grace towards them, eſpecially in that marvellous inſtance of it, his ſending his only-begotten ſon to redeem them by the blood of his croſs. They rebel both againſt the light of nature and the light of divine revelation, and take part with the grand enemy of God, and of all righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>What monſtrous vileneſs now is it, to act ſuch a part towards the adorable majeſty of heaven and earth, who is ſo infinitely excellent, and ſo infinitely worthy of the higheſt regards of all intelligent crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, who are under the ſtrongeſt obligations to live entirely devoted to his ſervice and glory! Can it then be otherwiſe, but that he muſt behold the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous, wicked conduct of his creatures, with the higheſt anger and reſentment? And muſt he not in honour to his great name, for the eſtabliſhment of his throne, the magnifying his law, and for the aſſerting and vindicating his holineſs, juſtice and truth, manifeſt his anger and reſentment towards them? Muſt he not on the whole, puniſh them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their deſerts? And conſidering his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite majeſty and dignity, muſt he not everlaſtingly puniſh them? It is certain that ſin is an infinite evil, if we conſider the object againſt whom it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, the infinite God, and it deſerves an infinite puniſhment. And although according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent aggravations of men's wickedneſs, there will be different degrees of puniſhment in hell, [<hi>with ſome,</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:011707_0014_0F881EB81EBCBA88"/>
we read <hi>it will be more tolerable than with others,</hi> Matt. 11. 24.] yet as to the duration of it, it will be alike as to all; <hi>an everlaſting deſtruction from God's preſence, and the glory of his power.</hi> This will be inflicted at laſt <hi>upon all that know not God, and who have not obeyed the goſpel of his ſon.</hi> And there will be no unrighteouſneſs in God, but he and his throne will be pure and guiltleſs. And poor, miſerable ſinners, in the place of torment will be conſtrained to own the equity and righteouſneſs of God, in inflicting his inſupportable and everlaſting wrath upon them.</p>
            <p>I will only ſay in a word here, when the apoſtle declares in our text, that the <hi>unrighteous ſhall not inherit the kingdom of God,</hi> he is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as intending thoſe that continue in their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs to the laſt. Not but that there have been many unrighteous ones, who have indulged themſelves in the moſt heinous vices, ſuch as the apoſtle makes mention of, who have experienced a bleſſed change both of ſtate and nature, and ſo from being children of wrath and heirs of hell, have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the children of God, and heirs to the heavenly kingdom, and in their ſpirits have been put into poſſeſſion of their inheritance, when they have been diſmiſſed hence by death.</p>
            <p>And this leads me now to diſcourſe upon the latter part of our text.—<hi>And ſuch were ſome of you.</hi> Such heinous tranſgreſſors as I have mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſome of you have been. The word in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, is emphatical—<hi>ſuch things</hi> were ſome of you, ſuch wretched, monſtrous creatures, who by the indulgence of ſuch deteſtable abominations, degraded
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:011707_0015_0F881EB8DEB1E130"/>
yourſelves below the beaſts that periſh. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which ye ſhall inherit the kingdom of God. And why? Becauſe <hi>ye are waſhed, ſanctified, juſtified in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the ſpirit of our God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might now enter into a large field, in treating up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe great and ineſtimable bleſſings here ſpoken of. But the time will only allow me to diſcourſe upon them in a ſummary way.</p>
            <p>When the apoſtle tells the Corinthians, who had been abominably vile and ungodly,—<hi>ye are waſhed,</hi> he intends ſomething more than their having been baptized into the chriſtian name by the waſhing of water. He intends their having been regenerated. This, <abbr>viz.</abbr> regeneration, is ſpoken of as a <hi>waſhing.</hi> So we read Titus 3. 4. of <hi>the waſhing of regeneration.</hi> And being regenerated, they were accordingly, as he goes on to ſpeak, <hi>ſanctified and juſtified.</hi> "Here" (as one obſerves) "is a rhetorical change of the natural order: Sanctification is mentioned before juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion." They are in their nature different; but conſidering their cloſe connection, we need not be critical here.</p>
            <p>Juſtification is a forenſic term, or a term borrowed from courts of juſtice. When the apoſtle tells the Corinthians, <hi>they were juſtified,</hi> he intends in general, that they were acquitted from guilt, pardoned by God, the father of mercies, the lawgiver and judge of mankind, even as criminals and malefactors ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times have been, by their gracious ſovereign's rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſentence of condemnation they were under for the violation of the laws, the guilt thereby contracted, and the penalty incurred. Juſtified perſons are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:011707_0016_0F881EB99EABD650"/>
from their guilt, the juſtice of God has no demands upon them. Their ſins are blotted out. God hides his face from them, and remembers them not againſt them, however numerous they have been, and though of a ſcarlet and crimſon colour. He receives them to favour, and looks upon them as <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous;</hi> for ſo they are in a legal ſenſe. "Goſpel-juſtification", (as one obſerves) <q>doth not barely take off the guilt of ſin and reverſe the ſentence of condemnation by a pardon, and ſo reſtore us to a ſtate of probation which might iſſue in a ſtate of condemnation again; it likewiſe pronounces us righteous, and brings us into a ſtate of preſent and perſonal acceptance with God to eternal life, whereby, according to the conſtitution of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, we have a ſure, an actual and abiding claim to it. It brings us into a new and compleat title to life, beyond what man ever had before, and into greater nearneſs to God, and higher dignities and bleſſings in his favour and love, than belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the firſt covenant.</q> 
               <hi>The free gift comes upon us to juſtification of life,</hi> Rom. 5. 18. <hi>And whom God juſtifies, them he alſo glorifies,</hi> chap. 8. 30.</p>
            <p>Such a bleſſed alteration as this was made in the ſtate of ſome of the Corinthians, who had been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned to the moſt flagitious practices; acquitted from guilt, delivered from condemnation, made righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, reſtored to favour and entitled to life. And wherefore was it ſo? Why, as in the text, it was <hi>in the name of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> or for his ſake, in virtue of his atonement by the blood of the croſs, by which he made peace, put away ſin, and brought in an everlaſting righteouſneſs. The righteouſneſs of Chriſt is every way adequate to the demands of
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:011707_0017_0F881EBA5EB76740"/>
the law and juſtice of God. Faith lays hold of this righteouſneſs and it is imputed to the guilty ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner for the juſtification of life. This is the language of the goſpel. And conſequently now, I would juſt obſerve—It is not owing nor can it be owing, either in whole or in part, to any works of righteouſneſs of the ſinner's own, that he is juſtified before God; but ſolely to the righteouſneſs of our great Redeemer, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But now, beſides ſuch a happy change of ſtate in the Corinthians, as their being juſtified, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced alſo a happy change of nature: <hi>Ye are ſanctified.</hi> This, as was hinted before, though differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent from their juſtification, was and always is in near connection with it. Being ſanctified they were brought into a conformity to the holy God, made partakers of a divine nature, all the powers of their ſouls renewed, and a holy, heavenly turn given to them. In the comprehenſive repreſentation of the apoſtle, 2 Cor. 5. 17. <hi>Being in Chriſt, they were new creatures, old things were paſſed away, and all things became new.</hi> Now they were brought to love the bleſſed God, to love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to love the divine law, to hate ſin, to mourn for it, to forſake it, and to conſecrate themſelves to God, to glorify him in their bodies and ſpirits which are his. Now they were poſſeſſed of the ſpirit of Chriſt, moulded into the genius of his goſpel, and had a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing diſpoſition and bent of heart to live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in the world, as the grace of God which bringeth ſalvation teacheth. This in brief we are to underſtand by their being <hi>ſanctified.</hi> And what a happy and moſt deſirable change was this! They were now conformed to the holy God,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:011707_0018_0F881EBB1EBCD5E0"/>
and the holy Jeſus, and brought into a meetneſs for the high and holy heavens, for the enjoyment of the holy God, for the ſociety of holy angels, and for their holy and ſublime exerciſes and employments.</p>
            <p>But now they themſelves were not the authors of this ſanctification: No, <hi>ye are ſanctified by the Spirit of our God.</hi> So we elſewhere read of <hi>the ſanctification of the Spirit</hi>—of <hi>the renewing of the holy Ghoſt.</hi> The bleſſed Spirit of God, who is the ſpirit of grace and holineſs, he is the author or efficient cauſe of the ſanctification of ſouls. This is abundantly the language of the inſpired oracles. And all chriſtian graces and virtues, are ſpoken of as <hi>fruits of the ſpirit:</hi> Foraſmuch as he by his gracious influences implants the ſeeds of them in the heart, cauſes them to take root there, to ſpring up and bring forth fruit to the praiſe and glory of God.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only juſt add here, that we may with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety ſpeak of being ſanctified, not only by the influence and agency of the Spirit of our God, but of being ſanctified <hi>in the name of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> or in virtue of his atonement. For it is to be conſidered, that the Spirit in his ſanctifying influences is the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of the death of Chriſt. Had he not offered himſelf a ſacrifice to God, it would have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that ſinners ſhould ever be recovered to the image of God, or become holy, as well as brought into a ſtate of pardon and juſtification. Accordingly we read of being <hi>ſanctified in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 2. And in the 30th ver. the apoſtle gives us a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive view of the whole of man's redemption, preſent and future, the whole of it, taking its riſe from the mediation of Chriſt. <hi>But of him, are ye
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:011707_0019_0F881EBBDEA882C0"/>
in Chriſt Jeſus, who of God is made unto us, wiſdom, and righteouſneſs, and ſanctification, and redemption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus I have in ſome meaſure gone through with the whole of the inſpired paſſage I at firſt read to diſcourſe upon, upon this ſorrowful occaſion.</p>
            <p>And now from the things that have been ſpoken, I may take occaſion to obſerve, with what a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous and admirable light the wiſdom and the grace of God, ſhines forth in the work of man's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. A better righteouſneſs than his own is provided, in which he may with ſafety appear before the holy and righteous God, both here and hereafter: And effectual proviſion made for his recovery from his pollution and degeneracy and reſtoration to a ſtate of true rectitude and moral purity. So that notwithſtanding his guilt and vileneſs, he may not only eſcape future wrath and perdition, but have a ſure title to and meetneſs for celeſtial glory and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> is all of God, of his contriving and effecting, and how gloriouſly is his wiſdom and his grace diſplayed and illuſtrated herein!</p>
            <p>Again,—What obligations are we under to Jeſus Chriſt, for undertaking this work, and carrying it into effect! Glorified ſaints will through eternal ages adore and praiſe him for his loving them and waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them from their ſins in his own blood, and in raiſing them to ſit together with him in heavenly places. <hi>Worthy is the Lamb that was ſlain, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive power and riches and wiſdom and ſtrength and honour and glory and bleſſing,</hi> Rev. 5. 12.</p>
            <p>Again,—What praiſes are due to God, from thoſe who have been made partakers of the great redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:011707_0020_0F881EBC9EA74658"/>
by Jeſus Chriſt; who have obtained the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of life, and the ſanctification of the Spirit, and ſo have a ſure title to and a proper meetneſs for the happineſs and glory of heaven! Well may the high praiſes of God be in their mouths for his rich grace and mercy towards them. Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but to thy name be all the glory.</p>
            <p>Nextly,—We may hence ſee, that redeemed ones are the moſt happy and bleſſed ones upon the earth. For their ſins are blotted out, their guilt pardoned and done away. Being in Chriſt, no condemnation belongs to them. They have on them the image of God. And God is a Father to them, and loves them as dear children, has provided a glorious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance for them in the higheſt heavens, and will by and by put them into the full and everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poſſeſſion of it. What are all the pomps and ſplenders of the world, all its wealth, honours and pleaſures, in compare with all this? Verily no more than the common pebbles to the moſt brilliant dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, or the lonely cottage of the beggar, to the magnificent palaces of princes and nobles.</p>
            <p>Laſtly,—We may hence ſee, that the vileſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, may obtain the richeſt ſpiritual bleſſings, ſuch as we have been ſpeaking of, the juſtification of life, and the ſanctification of the Spirit, and as the iſſue of all, eternal glorification in heaven.—</p>
            <p>We have an example of this in ſome among the Corinthians. Notwithſtanding their monſtrous and moſt deteſtable vices, which expoſed them to the damnation of hell, and which would have irrecover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſunk them down into it, had a provoked God wholly departed from them and given them up, yet
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:011707_0021_0F881EBD5EBEDD68"/>
they were juſtified and ſanctified in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God, and ſo brought to ſhare in the glorious redemption by Chriſt both preſent and future. So that we may never deſpair of the moſt heinous ſinners, if they are as infamous, as ſome of the Corinthians were that are ſpoken of in our text, of their being brought home to God and obtaining ſalvation. Nor may ſinners themſelves, let them have ever ſo afflicting, pungent a ſenſe of their guilt, their miſery and ill-deſerts, deſpair hereof, ſince thus it has been with others. The merits of Chriſt's precious blood, and the vital influences of the bleſſed Spirit can as effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally reach them, as the abominable Corinthians or any other the moſt atrocious ſinners. And in this caſe they will be delivered from the loweſt hell, and be among the number of the redeemed of the Lord in the kingdom of glory.</p>
            <p>I have choſen the ſubject I have been diſcourſing upon, mainly with a view to your inſtruction and benefit, <hi>poor man!</hi> who art under a ſentence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, this day to be executed upon you. We have called this ſolemn aſſembly, that you might once more before you die, have the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of having public, fervent prayers offered up to God on your behalf; and receiving inſtruction and counſel in thoſe things which concern your everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well-being. While you have attended the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic worſhip of God, ſince your condemnation, very ſolemn and weighty have been the inſtructions and counſels you have received, and ſo they have been in a more private manner: And frequent and fervent ſupplications have been offered up to the God of heaven for mercy to your precious
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:011707_0022_0F881EBE1EB59A50"/>
and immortal ſoul. You have had a conſiderable ſpace ſince your condemnation to prepare for this ſolemn day, and for the ſolemn hour of death juſt before you. And as this is the laſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity you will ever have to attend to the public inſtructions of God's word, ſee that you give a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and earneſt heed to what may be now ſpoken to you in the name of the Lord.—</p>
            <p>I would be far from upbraiding you with your wickedneſs: However, from the crime you have been convicted of, and for which you have been ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced to die, you muſt be very ſenſible that your character is pointed out in the black catalogue of ſinners mentioned in my text. Among other atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſinners, who ſhall not inherit the kingdom of God, the apoſtle mentions <hi>thieves.</hi> And were you chargeable with no other crime than that of theft, this alone would be ſufficient to exclude you the kingdom of God. For this is a direct breach of an expreſs commandment of God. <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſteal,</hi> Exod. 20. 15. And only the violation of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment is an argument of rebellion againſt the Lord, a deſpiſing his authority and his law, and there is an infinite evil in it, and it deſerves an infinite puniſhment. You have had ſolemn warnings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this vice, in the public puniſhments you have been brought to; but you preſumed to go on not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, hardning your ſelf againſt God and his law, and the laws of man, as though you could proſper. You have diſregarded God and his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and the judgment to come. You forſook God, and God forſook you. You would have none of God, and ſo he gave you up unto your own heart's luſts, and to walk in your own counſels. And what is the diſmal effect of it? Why, you have
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:011707_0023_0F881EBEDEA1CFE8"/>
been brought before the tribunal of man, and have been ſentenced to die before the time. And the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn day is now come—and preparation is made for your execution. The grave has opened its mouth to receive you, and you will preſently be laid in it, while your ſpirit ſhall go to the world of ſpirits.—You are now hovering upon the brink of eternity, and will preſently be in it. O what an awful ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is this! But yet though the wrath of God is revealed from heaven againſt all the ungodlineſs and unrighteouſneſs of men, and you muſt be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that you are deſerving of it, yet through the riches of God's grace in Chriſt, you may eſcape it, and be received to the kingdom of glory. And if you are intereſted in the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and renewed and ſanctified by the bleſſed Spirit, you may die in the firm faith and hope of being ſo.—And let me tell you, that if you are in a juſtified, ſanctified ſtate, you have been awakned to ſee your wretched, guilty, miſerable condition as a ſinner, been led to ſee what an evil and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thing ſin is, not merely as you have expoſed yourſelf to the ſword of civil juſtice, and to the everlaſting wrath of God; but principally, becauſe you have acted a vile, rebellious, ungrateful part towards the glorious Majeſty of heaven, who in numberleſs inſtances has been good and kind and merciful to you; and your heart is broken and contrite on account hereof: And you have been brought to ſee that you are without help and ſtrength in yourſelf, that you have nothing to recommend you to God, and that he might juſtly make you a monument of his everlaſting wrath, becauſe of your heinous wickedneſs; but yet that there is hope for you—that there is a glorious ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:011707_0024_0F881EBF9EA55258"/>
in Chriſt.—You have been led to believe in him as an alſufficient Saviour, and to embrace him as the Lord your righteouſneſs, and to truſt your whole ſoul upon his infinite merits. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have found a great and mighty change of heart; that you eſteem and love the bleſſed God ſupremely and for his own incomparable excellencies as well as benefits—that Chriſt is precious to your ſoul, that you love the law of God, and that ſin which is oppoſite to it is moſt hateful to you—that you heartily bow to God and have a ſupreme re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to his glory, and fervent charity towards men, and that after all you freely acknowledge yourſelf an unprofitable ſervant, and look for eternal life as the free gift of God, of his rich and glorious grace through Jeſus Chriſt the only mediator between God and man.</p>
            <p>It is no proper ſeaſon for any one to flatter you, or for you to flatter yourſelf. Your eternal all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon your finding matters thus with you, as I have now ſaid. Look critically and thoroughly and impartially into yourſelf, and ſee how it is with you. It is an awful thing for any one, eſpecially<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at the laſt, as is the cafe with you, to deceive him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and think he is ſomething, when he is nothing, from high hopes of heaven, to find himſelf at death, ſinking down into the loweſt hell. A miſtake here is irreparable.</p>
            <p>It is our hearts deſire and prayer to God, that though you muſt die this day an ignominious death, yet that you may die in a ſtate of favour with God, intereſted in the precious merits of the bleſſed Jeſus, and that you may have the comfortable,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:011707_0025_0F881EC05EACEF90"/>
ſubſtantial evidences hereof, and that your ſoul may go to be at reſt with God, and be joined this day to the ſociety of ſaints and angels in the kingdom of glory.</p>
            <p>Now that you are about retiring from this place, and will have a few moments left you, proſtrate yourſelf before the throne of God's mercy, ſpread your ſins and diſtreſſes before him; cry to him with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, for the exerciſe of his mercy towards you, that he would ſhine into your ſoul with the light of his bleſſed countenance, and enable you to meet death with all the ſolemn circumſtances attending it, with a holy courage, and that in the fatal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you may with a firm faith reſign your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſpirit into the hands of the bleſſed Jeſus, ſaying with Stephen, <hi>Lord Jeſus receive my ſpirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So now, on the whole, we earneſtly recommend you to the grace of God and to the mercy of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, even unto eternal life.</p>
            <p>And now, Brethren! We may here ſee the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fruits and effects of indulged wickedneſs.—Overmuch wickedneſs tends to an immature death, ſometimes by the ſword of civil juſtice being drawn upon the committers of it, as in the inſtance before us, and in the inſtance we had in this place but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two years ago, as well as in other inſtances; and partly alſo as many vices tend by a natural cauſality to ſhorten men's days upon earth. But then this is not the worſt of it, for it tends to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal death and deſtruction, as has been ſhown in the preceeding diſcourſe. O then, how ought every one, young and old, to take warning by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of others, and ſhun the paths of vice, and of
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:011707_0026_0F881EC11EB3F858"/>
the deſtroyer! Let every ſinner immediately repent and turn to God, and fly to Jeſus who ſaves from ſin, and delivers from the wrath to come; and henceforth live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in the world, that ſo he may be happy in the favour of God here, and at laſt be received to the kingdom of glory. And O that all Iſrael may hear and fear and do no more ſo wickedly!</p>
            <p>And in a word—May all that attend the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this poor man, lift up their hearts in fervent prayer for him, that God would diſplay the riches of his grace in his everlaſting ſalvation. And may the minds of all preſent here and in this place this day, ſolemnized upon ſuch an affecting occaſion; avoid every thing that is rude and diſorderly, retire home in proper ſeaſon, and take occaſion to bleſs God for the reſtraints of his grace, and ſenſible of their weakneſs and liableneſs to temptations, ſeek for the guidance of his good Spirit in the way of duty, and that they may be kept from falling, and be preſerved by the mighty power of God, through faith unto ſalvation. May it be thus with every one of us, through the riches of God's grace in Chriſt Jeſus! to whom with the Father and the holy Ghoſt be all honour, power and glory, now and forevermore!</p>
