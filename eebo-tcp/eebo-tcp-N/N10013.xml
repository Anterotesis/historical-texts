            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE converſion and ſalvation of a loſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, may juſtly be reckoned among the wonderful works of God to the children of men. And ſometimes ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances attend the work, which greatly ſerve to increaſe the wonder. Such an inſtance we have preſented to view in the text before us.</p>
            <p>Here is a wretched ſinner come to the brink of the grave, and the eternal world; in the broad way to hell.</p>
            <p>That this was his caſe, is evident from what St. Matthew and Mark relate of him. Matthew
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:012725_0004_0F8BC251A2CF6468"/>
ſays, that when the chief prieſts, mocking him, with the ſcribes and elders, ſaid, he ſaved others himſelf he cannot ſave: it he be the King of Iſrael, let him now come down from the croſs, and we will believe him. He truſted in God: let him deliver him now if he will have him: for he ſaid, I am the Son of God. The thieves alſo (not one only, but both) which were crucified with him, caſt the ſame in his teeth.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. 27.41, 42, 43, 44.</note> They join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with thoſe who mocked the Son of God in the agonies of death. Mark ſays, and they that were crucified with him reviled him.<note n="†" place="bottom">Mark 15.32.</note> And in as much as revilers ſhall not inherit the kingdom of God,<note n="‡" place="bottom">1 Cor. 6.10.</note> we may ſafely conclude, that he was ſtill in the way to deſtruction.</p>
            <p>But, behold! all on a ſudden, he is apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſovereign and all-powerful grace! he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, and humbled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> believes and repents. He prays, and in anſwer to his prayer, receives a gracious promiſe from Chriſt, of a ſudden tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the paradiſe of God!</p>
            <p>With reſpect to this thief, the following parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars are obſervable.</p>
            <p n="1">I. His conviction and humiliation. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever proof he might heretofore have been againſt convictions, now, at the very laſt period of his wretched life, the arrows of God penetrate his ſtoney heart; the law of God is ſet home up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his conſcience; with a convincing power and light, his eyes are opened to ſee his ſins, and the wrath of God to which his ſins had rendered him obnoxious; his conſcience is thoroughly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened, and he is in the utmoſt diſtreſs, to know, what he muſt do to be ſaved from that wrath,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:012725_0005_0F8BC2523B815E30"/>
which he now ſees juſt ready to fall on his guilty ſoul.—And his eyes are opened, not only to ſee the awful ſtate that his ſins had brought him into, but alſo, that his preſent ſufferings, and whatever he might hereafter ſuffer, are but a juſt reward of his ſins: which diſcovery is abſolutely neceſſary in order to true humiliation. For unleſs the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſees the juſtneſs of his puniſhment, he never will be humble under it.</p>
            <p>And that this was the caſe with this malefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, is evident from what the evangeliſt Luke relates of him in the chapter before us. For we read, that when the other malefactor, railed againſt Chriſt, this penitent thief rebuked him, ſaying, doſt thou not fear God, ſeeing thou art in the ſame condemnation; and we indeed juſtly, for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man (that is Chriſt) hath done nothing amiſs.<note n="*" place="bottom">Context<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ver. 40, 41.</note>— He fully confeſſes his own ſin and guilt, and that the ſentence of death he was now under, was juſt. He alſo aſſerts the innocence of the ſuffering Saviour of the world: which are convincing proofs that his conviction and humiliation were genuine, and that he was a ſit object of divine compaſſion.</p>
            <p n="2">II. His faith and repentance.</p>
            <p>He believes him whom he now ſaw in the ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of a ſhameful death, to be the Lord of life. That he was a King, and had a kingdom: That crowns and kingdoms were at his dipoſe:—That he was able to ſave him from eternal death. To ſuppoſe the contrary, would be to make his prayer a piece of down-right idolatry, and not an act of religious worſhip.</p>
            <p>And if we conſider the ſtate and condition that Chriſt was in, at that time when he believed; his
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012725_0006_0F8BC2548CA941B8"/>
faith will appear the more wonderful. The Son of righteouſneſs now ſuffered a very great eclipſe, the glory of his Godhead was greatly obſcur'd by his ſufferings: he was in the very depth of his humiliation; he was now under an unjuſt ſentence of death, and is numbered with tranſgreſſors, to undergo the pains of a ſhameful death, and was now in the very agonies of it: now it was that his Father hid his face from him, and put the bitter cup of his wrath into his hand, which he muſt needs drink up.</p>
            <p>The ſufferings of Chriſt at this time were ſuch, that the faith of his diſciples was greatly ſtagger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: One had betrayed him, another had denied him; and all had forſook him, and fled.—But notwithſtanding all theſe diſadvantages, this penitent thief, by faith ſaw him to be the only Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of periſhing ſinners, that he was able to ſave him in particular, and that there was no other ſhelter to which he could fly, and be ſafe from the ſtorm of God's anger.—And by faith, he lay'd hold on him, as the only hope ſet before him; and through faith in the ſuffering Saviour, he obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the forgivneſs of all his ſins, and an inheritance among the ſaints; as is evident from Chriſt's gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſe to him. To day ſhalt thou be with me in paradiſe.</p>
            <p>And he not only believes on Chriſt, but alſo repents; his repentance was not meerly legal, but evangelical. However ſtrongly he heretofore had been attached to ſin, he now ſees the infinite moral evil of it, and loathing it in his heart, turns from it to God with ſelf abhorrence.</p>
            <p n="3">III. His prayer.</p>
            <p>An unconverted man <hi>may</hi> pray; but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted man <hi>will</hi> pray. Prayer is the breath of the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012725_0007_0F8BC2553919F738"/>
new-born ſoul. Soon after Saul the perſecutor was converted; it was ſaid of him, behold he prayeth. <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts 9.11.</note>
            </p>
            <p>This thief is no ſooner converted, but he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly falls to prayer. Lord remember me when thou comeſt into thy kingdom, q. d. When thou art enthron'd at the right-hand of thy Father; and partakeſt of the glory, which thou hadſt with him, before the world was; when thou art in full poſſeſſion of thy mediatorial kingdom, for the carrying on the work of ſinful man's redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; then remember me. Let me have a part in thy interceſſion with the Father in behalf of periſhing ſinners: let thy precious blood, be ſprinkled upon my guilty and polluted ſoul, that thereby I may be abſolved from my guilt, and thoroughly waſhed from my filth. That when I leave this world, which I muſt inſtantly do, and enter upon eternity, I may come to thee, and dwell forever with thee in thy kingdom of glory.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The gracious promiſe which he received from Chriſt in anſwer to his prayer: To day ſhalt thou be with me in paradiſe.</p>
            <p>Although it is impoſſible that ſinners ſhould merit any thing from God by their prayers; yet, by his inſtitution, it is a means of grace, for them to be in the uſe of, for the obtaining of thoſe favors which he moſt freely beſtows upon periſhing ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
            <p>This penitent ſinner prayed to Chriſt to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber him when he came into his kingdom; and Chriſt makes a promiſe to him, of the greateſt good he was capable of receiving To be forever with Chriſt in his kingdom, and to be glorified to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with him, is the greateſt honor, and the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012725_0008_0F8BC255FA4C2608"/>
greateſt happineſs our nature is capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving.</p>
            <p>If we would ſee the exceeding preciouſneſs of the promiſe, made to this condemned malefactor, we muſt conſider, (1.) The time when it was made: it was, when he was inſtantly to leave the world, and enter upon eternity; where his ſtate muſt be fixed, and remain unalterable forever. (2.) When all the ſins of his paſt vicious life ſtared him in the face, and he ſaw himſelf juſtly expoſed to everlaſting puniſhment. Oh! what a ſupport and comfort muſt this gracious promiſe be to his diſtreſſed ſoul: the ſeaſonableneſs of the promiſe adds to its ſweetneſs. (3.) That it was ſpeedily to be fulfilled; his faith, hope, and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, were not to be long exerciſed in waiting for the accompliſhment of it. The promiſe was made and fulfilled the ſame day: To-day ſhalt thou be with me in paradiſe. A bleſſed change indeed, to go from earth to heaven, from the company of mortal men, to be in company with Chriſt, holy angels, and the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect; from the pains of death, to inherit eternal life; from the ſhame of an accurſed death, to wear a crown of glory that fadeth not away.</p>
            <div type="application">
               <head>The APPLICATION.</head>
               <p>And 1. A word by way of caution. Let none be encouraged from the example of this thief's finding mercy at the very laſt, to put off their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and turning to God, until they come to die. The extraordinary and miraculous conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the thief on the croſs, is not left on record, that we ſhould make ſuch an improvement of it. For, as we received all from God, it is highly reaſonable, that all our time and ſtrength ſhould
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:012725_0009_0F8BC257345F16D8"/>

               <p>God calls upon ſinners to remember him in the days of their youth: and there is a promiſe, that thoſe that ſeek him early ſhall find him. Chriſt enjoins it as a duty incumbent upon all, to ſeek firſt the kingdom of heaven and the righteouſneſs thereof: and therefore it highly concerns every ſinner ſpeedily to forſake his ſins, and turn to God. He that puts off his repentance for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, is in great danger of looſing his ſoul. For now is the time that God calls upon ſinners to repent, and offers them his holy Spirit to aſſiſt them in the difficult work: nor have ſinners any aſſurance that they ſhall ever have another offer of grace, or an opportunity to turn to God. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold now is the accepted time, behold now is the day of ſalvation.<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Cor. 6.2</note> To day if ye will hear his voice harden not your hearts. <note n="†" place="bottom">Heb 3 7</note>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, the longer ſinners continue in ſin, the more hardned their hearts are through the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of it. The longer the work of converſion is put off, the greater will the difficulties be that will attend it.</p>
               <p>Nor let any deſpair of the mercy of God while they have life.</p>
               <p>Although God might juſtly ſay to every ſinner that puts off his repentance until he is in agonies of death, and upon the very brink of hell, and then in his diſtreſs cries for mercy: I have called, and ye have refuſed, I have ſtretched out my hand, and no man regarded. I alſo will laugh at your ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity,

               <p n="2">2. See the ſovereignty of God, in beſtowing his grace upon this condemned malefactor. Whenever God ſhews mercy to ſinners, he acts as a ſovereign, but his ſovereignty does more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicouſly appear in the ſalvation of ſome, than it does in the ſalvation of others; and perhaps in none more than in this wretched ſinner.—He had ſpent his whole life in rebellion againſt God, and is now brought to the public place of execution, to die by the hand of juſtice, having by his ſin forfeited his life: and although he is now as it were in the very ſuburbs of hell; can join with thoſe that mocked and reviled the Son of God in his dying agonies. Surely none appears leſs qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified to receive mercy than he, or leſs deſerving of it.—But while he is in this ſtate, he is appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by ſovereign grace, and mercy triumphs in his ſalvation.—And what ſhall we ſay to theſe things? Surely he will have mercy on whom he will.</p>

                  <pb n="11" facs="unknown:012725_0011_0F8BC25DA1BE8CC0"/>3. See the efficacious power of divine grace. It is not all the thunder from Mount-Sinai, or the greateſt degrees of legal terror a ſinner is capable of ſuffering, that will change his heart. All the law can do, is to convince the ſinner of his ſins, to awaken his conſcience, alarm his fears, and ſhew him his need of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But that which the law cannot do, grace can. Oh! what a marvellous change was inſtantly wrought in this malefactor by the energy of grace! Perhaps the ſame hour in which he reviled Chriſt, he becomes a true penitent; freely confeſſing his ſins, acknowledging that he ſuffered juſtly, and that Chriſt ſuffered unjuſtly. He now ſorrows for ſin with a godly ſorrow; his ſorrow worked re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to ſalvation, not to be repented of. He is now become a new creature: old things are paſt away; behold, all things are become new.<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Cor. 5.17.</note>— Sanctifying grace, in a gracious meaſure, had pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified his heart from ſin, and he is able to perform the acts of believing, repenting, and turning to God; which are proper to the new creature only<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor is it poſſible that ſuch an effect ſhould proceed from any other cauſe. It is grace only, that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dues the corruptions of the heart, and reſtores the moral image of God to the ſouls of men. Therefore, what great reaſon have the ſinful chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men to be thankful to God, that he ſhould ever condeſcend to beſtow his grace upon any.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That if ſinners would be partakers of the grace of God, they muſt ſeek to him for it thro' a crucified Saviour.</p>

by all that they can do, to lay him under the leaſt obligation: yet he has appointed the means of grace for ſinners to make uſe of, for the obtaining of grace, which he beſtows moſt freely.</p>
               <p>This is agreeable to the plan of the Goſpel, and therefore ſinners may not neglect the means of grace, becauſe they cannot merit by the uſe of them. It is evident from the ſcriptures, that God ordinarily beſtows his grace upon ſinners when they are uſing the means preſcribed in the goſpel for the obtaining of it.

It was the only means he could then make uſe of; the time was paſt with him for other duties: and he does not neglect that; he poured out his ſoul in ſtrong cries to Chriſt, whom he believed was able to ſave him from eternal death; and he obtained that which he ſought after; a promiſe of reſting with Chriſt after he left the world.</p>

Oh therefore now conſider before it is too late, what an awful thing it is to appear before the tribunal of the great God: when all the ſins of your paſt life will be ſet in order before your eyes with all the aggravations that have attended them: That if you are found an impenitent ſinner, deſtitute of faith in Chriſt, and repentance towards God, you muſt hear the dreadful ſentence, Depart ye curſed into everlaſting fire.</p>
               <p>St. Paul durſt not entertain the leaſt thought of appearing at the bar of God, in any other righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs than the ſurety-ſhip righteouſneſs of Chriſt; accordingly he expreſſed his moſt vehement de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, that he might be found in him, Not having mine own righteouſneſs which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Chriſt, the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs which is of God by faith.<note n="*" place="bottom">Phil. 3.5.</note> Nor is there any other refuge to which you can flee and be ſafe.

Although your body is under a ſentence of death not to be revoked, which muſt be ſpeedily executed: yet there is hope con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the life of your precious ſoul. If with a broken heart and a contrite ſpirit, you confeſs your ſins to God, and lay hold on Chriſt by faith, (as many and as great as your ſins are) you ſhall find mercy: He will abſolve you from all your ſins, and juſtify you freely, by imputing the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt to you: He will receive you to his favor, and give you a place among the bleſſed.

               <p>And as motives to excite and ſtir you up to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the exhortation, conſider (I.)

For there is no wiſdom nor knowledge in the grave whither thou goeſt: As death leaves you, the judgment will find you. (2.) The willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt to receive you upon your coming to him for mercy. He ſays, Him that cometh to me I will in no wiſe caſt out.<note n="*" place="bottom">John 6.37.</note> Therefore let your laſt breath be ſpent in calling upon him for mercy: Say with the penitent thief. Lord, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member me now thou art in thy kingdom; which if you do in faith, you will be intitl'd to the ſame promiſe he was. (3.) The great ability of Chriſt to ſave you: he is not only willing but able alſo, to ſave to the utmoſt, all that come to him. It is ſaid of him by the prophet Iſaiah, That he is mighty to ſave! <note place="bottom">Iſa. 68.1.</note>—He has paid the full price of man's redemption. By his active and paſſive o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, the law of God is magnified and made honorable, his juſtice fully ſatisfied, and the honor of his moral government ſecured: ſo that God can be juſt in juſtifying the greateſt ſinner who believeth in Chriſt. Oh! the infinite efficacy of the blood of Chriſt! It is an all-ſufficient ſacrifice of atonement for ſin. And there are ſome of the very chief of ſinners, ſuch as Manaſſah, Mary Magdalene, and a perſecuting Saul, who now ſhine in the kingdom of glory: theſe and a great multitude beſides, which no man can number, were all redeemed to God by that precious blood. Let the conſideration of theſe things encourage you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to make your flight to Chriſt by faith. (4.)

and painful death. Oh! ſad ſtate indeed! But your preſent diſtreſs, however great, is nothing, compared with the horror that your poor ſoul will be filled with inſtantly after it leaves the body, if you are found in an unconverted ſtate.—You muſt be born again, and become a new creature. Pray earneſtly to God to give you a heart to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of all your ſins, and that for Chriſt's ſake he would forgive you; that your tongue may ſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud of his righteouſneſs: that he would circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe your heart, to fear his great name, and to love him ſupremely: that he would give grace to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able you to be of a Chriſt-like temper and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition towards all men. O take care you do not leave the world, cheriſhing enmity in your heart againſt any man; but forgive all men who have treſpaſſed againſt you, or you cannot expect for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givneſs from God. If you depart this life deſtitute of theſe qualifications, you'll fall into the hands of an angry God; who will bring you to his bar to receive the dreadful ſentence, Depart ye curſed into everlaſting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels. Oh! and can you bear the thoughts of an everlaſting ſeparation from God? To ſuffer the fierceneſs of his anger. And as there is none that can ſave you from the wrath to come but Chriſt, and he is both able and willing to do it; let me perſuade you by the terror of the Lord, to accept of him upon the terms of the goſpel. (5.) As a further motive to perſuade you to believe, repent, and turn to God in Chriſt, conſider that your repentance will be matter of joy to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of God: There is joy in heaven over a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting ſinner: yea, Chriſt himſelf will rejoice over you.

Why have I been kept from ruining myſelf, while o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have been left to do it!—And conſider, that it is not ſufficient in order to your eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that you have reſtraining grace.

            <p>ALL the difference that ever happened between <hi>David Wilſon</hi> and myſelf was on the 25th of <hi>May,</hi> 1772, and to the beſt of my judgment between eight and nine o'clock in the afternoon, but being a dark and rainy day I cannot ſo very well tell the exact time—In the fore-part of the day I happen'd to fall in company with ſaid <hi>Wilſon</hi> and one <hi>Stephen Goodwin,</hi> at Capt. <hi>William Swanton's</hi> in <hi>Georgetown,</hi> and we was all homeward bound; ſaid <hi>Wilſon</hi> had a canoe and I had none, I aſked Mr. <hi>Wilſon</hi> for a paſſage, he told me I ſhould be welcome if I would work for it, and then we all ſet out very loving together.—<hi>Wilſon</hi> took the paddle to ſteer with, and I took the after oar.—We rowed off in the river and went on board a ſloop that was bound up ſaid river; the maſter of the ſloop received us kindly, and gave each of us a glaſs of rum, which we received kindly, and we went up in the ſloop three miles and an half, where the ſloop came to anchor, and then we was going along, but the maſter of the veſſel told us if we would ſtop till they had made up their ſails, he would give us a drink of toddy; he made half a gallon, and ſix of us drank it, and then we ſet out in the canoe as loving as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and went about a mile and an half up the river, to Mr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Joſeph Macey's,</hi> and went on ſhore to get ſome fiſh, this ſame houſe was a tavern, and Mr. <hi>Macey</hi> aſked if I would take a drink of flip, I told him I did not care if I did, accordingly he made a mug and five of us drank it, and then <hi>Wilſon</hi> aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a mug, and we alſo drank it, and then I ſaid it was time to go home,—<hi>Stephen Goodwin</hi> ſaid he had drank of our liquor, and he would have his mug, I told him it was not worth while, for if he had, I would drink none of it, but he got it made, and went out of the houſe, and I ſuppoſe they did drink it, and then we went away as loving as before, and <hi>Wilſon</hi> took his paddle, and I took the after oar, and I ſet down on the ſeat facing <hi>Wilſon,</hi> and which was about four feet diſtance from where <hi>Wilſon</hi> ſet on the ſtern of the canoe, and we rowed along about a mile and an half, and had no differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence at that time—then Mr. <hi>Wilſon</hi> aſked me when I intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to get out the lumber for Capt. <hi>Swanton,</hi> I told him as ſoon as I had done my planting, damn it ſays <hi>Wilſon,</hi> I will not wait for that, I told him he had no need to, he might go to work and the more he did the more he would have to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
<pb facs="unknown:012725_0022_0F8BC26760073800"/>
but he ſeemed to be mad, and made uſe of bad lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and I ſaid nothing to him about that again, but aſked him to ſet me aſhore on the ſands, near to my houſe, no damn you he ſays, I wont, not till I get up to Eſquire <hi>Prebble's</hi> landing. I told him I ſhould not be able to get home, he told me I might ſtay at a tavern all night, I told him I had no money, damn you he ſaid, I will lend you money to pay for your ſupper and lodging, and made a laugh at it, for he knew he had none, and ſo he kept his courſe towards <hi>Abegaduſett</hi> river—then I aſked him if he did not intend to put me on ſhore, no damn you, he ſaid, I wont till I get you up to the 'ſquire's l<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ding, or up to <hi>Stephen Goodwin's,</hi> I told him I had done as much for him before now, he aſked me what I ever did for him, I told him he knew well enough, he told me I told a lie he did not, and inſiſted my telling him, I told him in letting him have things to ſupport his family two years ago, and I had not got my pay yet, he ſaid that was a damn'd lie, I told him he knew it was true, he then told me I was a damn'd liar, I told him I could not bear with ſuch abuſe, he told me he would uſe me worſe, and he offer'd to puſh at me with his paddle, and I offered to catch hold of it, and then <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen Goodwin</hi> took away my oar, and <hi>Wilſon</hi> ſtruck me twice with his paddle, and as he was endeavouring to ſtrike me the third time, I catch'd hold of his paddle and pulled him off the ſtern of the canoe, and then <hi>Stephen Goodwin</hi> took the paddle away from us, and I dont know but that I might ſtrike him with my hand, but am not certain, for I held one of his hands with one of mine, and he told me to let him go, I told him I would if he would be eaſy, which he promiſed, he then got on the ſtern of the canoe again, and aſked for his paddle, which <hi>Stephen Goodwin</hi> gave him upon ſaid <hi>Wilſon</hi>'s promiſing to be peaceable; <hi>Stephen Goodwin</hi> likewiſe gave me my oar, which was about ſix feet and an half long; and when we had rowed about the ſpace of twenty or thirty rods, <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> began his abuſive language again, and ſaid I was a damn'd liar, and I ſpoke a ſolemn word and ſaid, that by the name of the living GOD, if he told me ſo again, I would ſtrike him with my oar if I ſhould ſtrike him overboard, he ſaid you do tell a damn'd lie, and if you offer to ſtrike me I will run my paddle through your heart, and lifted his paddle againſt me, and being warned, I lifted my oar, not meaning to kill, nor to ſtrike any certain place, but the chief aim I had was to ſave my own life, but unhappily the oar and paddle met, and the oar came down upon his head, and was the fatal blow, tho' GOD knows I had no deſign of murder in my heart; with the blow and the heeling of the canoe, <hi>Wilſon</hi> fell overboard, immediately I ſaid to <hi>Stephen Goodwin, Wilſon</hi> is overboard,
<pb facs="unknown:012725_0023_0F8BC26B51605958"/>
for God's ſake back aſtern the canoe, but he was incapable of being much help, though we backed the canoe as well as we could, but all in vain, for in leſs than two minutes I ſaw <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> riſe on the top of the water about three rods off, and he ſunk again, and we made all the ſearch we could, but in vain, we could ſee no more of him—I aſked <hi>Stephen Goodwin</hi> if he knew who gave the firſt blow, he ſaid he could not tell.— This is as true an account as I can give, as I know I muſt anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer it at the bar of God.—And now let me exhort all people to abſtain from drinking to exceſs, and from giving way to violent paſſion, which two vices were the principal reaſon of the death of Mr. <hi>David Wilſon,</hi> and of my ignominious death by the hands of juſtice.</p>

               <p>THIS to my true and loving wife, my children and my friend, I leave you theſe few lines to look upon when I am dead and gone; mourn for me, not as a murderer, for as I am in the preſence of God begging for mercy and hope to obtain, my conſcience is clear of that ſin, and I have hopes through the blood of Chriſt, that Almighty God will cleanſe me from all other ſins, who you muſt all apply to for ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by earneſt prayer and ſupplication: And I beg in Chriſt's name, that you will all be in earneſt, leſt the day of your death come unawares and finds you unprepared, and then without diſpute you will be eternally miſerable; and for the Lord's ſake, and your immortal ſoul's ſake, old and young of you, I beg you will keep out of wicked company, for that is what has brought me to this unhappy fate, therefore take warning by this. Dear wife, if you put out any of your children, put them to good people, and ſo I muſt leave you to God, and beg you will take care and not be enſnared by a wicked world, and pray that God will bleſs you with all ſpiritual bleſſings, and the good things of this life; be contented with ſuch neceſſaries as God gives you, and dont think hard of any croſſes you meet with in this life, but ſay as David ſays, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid ſaid it is good for me that I have been afflicted, and beg of God to ſanctify them to you for good.—So I bid adieu to the world, and the Lord have mercy upon us.—This by <hi>Solomon Goodwin,</hi> the day before his execution.—</p>
