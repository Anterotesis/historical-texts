         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>AS this work was undertaken with no evil motive, the author thinks it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on him to obviate ſome imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which he thinks he has been unjuſtly laid under.</p>

Kline and Reynolds, and requeſted that they might be informed of the author of the Philadelphiad? Meſſrs. K &amp; R ſent for the author—the Gentlemen aſked him if he was not the author of the Philadelphiad?—he was anſwered in the affirmitive—They then ſaid that it was a ſhame for a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>his profeſſion</hi> to have any thing a-do with ſuch a publication—the author ſaid, indeed he was very ſorry that ſeveral people had ſo truly merited the cenſures they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived—But Mr—interrupts one of the gentlemen, you know that private cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters ſhould not be meddled with!—O d—n it, 'tis a ſhame by G—He was going on with this courtly dialect when the author aſked him if private vice was leſs cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable than public?—He had no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to confound this, and upon the author's

telling him that he would have none of his impertinence, he ſeemed inclined to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promiſe matters, and went ſo far as to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate that he would furniſh the author with a ſum of money if he would contradict, in his next publication, circumſtances of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters that the pointed out—The money was refuſed, and the characters ſhall ſtand as they are juſtly painted.—Our opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions may ſometimes be wrong, but our judgments ſhall never be perverted.</p>

                  <p>AMIDST the multipliciy of buſineſs which favour has heaped on me from time to time I have juſt ſnatched a moment—a moment that I could only devote to charms like yours—to requeſt that you will uſe your never-failing influence to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce your Fathers, Huſbands, Brothers and Sweethearts to peruſe the following ſheets, which are calculated for your entertainment as well as theirs—and for the information of the COMMONWEALTH in general.</p>
                  <p>The author had once given over the notion of continuing this work, but he found the calls of the public ſo importunate for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and third volumes, and the demand
<pb facs="unknown:018730_0082_0FA8104EF3CE6BB0"/>
for them ſo extraordinary, that at their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitation he is willing to expoſe vice and contribute as much as in his power to their amuſement.</p>
