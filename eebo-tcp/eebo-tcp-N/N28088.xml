            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>THE editors of the following pathetic and animating exhortations, conceive it a duty they owe to the memory of the deceaſed preacher to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that the author though repeatedly ſolicited, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver gave his approbation to the publication of them, owing perhaps in part to motives of delicacy. They were nevertheleſs publiſhed in his day, and read with avidity, ſeveral of them having high encomiums paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon them, in the Critical and Monthly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>views, the moſt approved teſtimonies of the value of any production offered to the public from the preſs.</p>
            <p>The preacher being now, by his removal from this fate of probation, far beyond the reach of human cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or the influence of human adulation, we are the more induced to a republication of them; believing that the valuable matter they contain, whilſt it cannot fail to gratify the ſearcher after <hi>Oratory</hi> is alſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently calculated to animate the ſoul to the purſuit of virtue.</p>
            <p>It may perhaps be neceſſary to remark, on account of thoſe unacquainted with the Tenets of the ſociety
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:037439_0003_100D42F3259AA5E0"/>
with which the preacher was united in religious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, that they hold not with delivering written or ſtudied diſcourſes, and that conſiſtently therewith, the following ſermons were delivered <hi>extempore,</hi> and taken down in characters as they flowed from the lips of the preacher, being the pure effuſions of a heart animated with the love of the Univerſal Parent of mankind, and ardently ſolicitous for the good of ſouls —or, as a certain writer has expreſſed of him "his voice was lifted up in an extemporaneous effuſion of rapturous eloquence, which being attended with ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior power and ſolemnity, at once captivated the ear, and made contrite the heart."</p>
            <p>Far be it from us to multiply encomiums—we wiſh not to exalt the inſtrument; but rather to ſtimulate to the purſuit, not only of thoſe virtues ſo eminently characteriſtic of him; but alſo, ſo abundantly diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the following communications, and which need from us no comment.</p>
            <p>We ſhall only add for the information of thoſe into whoſe hands former American Editions of Fothergills ſermons may have fallen, that the preſent publication contains an addition of four others delivered by him, and never before printed in this country—the peruſal of which, we doubt not, will be equally acceptable with the former, and found to contain matter no leſs valuable and inſtructive.</p>

            <head>CHARACTER OF THE LATE Mr. <hi>SAMUEL FOTHERGILL,</hi> BROTHER TO THE PHYSICIAN DR. FOTHERGILL</head>
            <p>TO commemorate the virtues of great and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent men, who have been honourable in their day, is a tribute due to their memory. A tribute which ſenſible men pay from emotions of reſpectful gratitude; and from a hope that it may prove an incentive to the living to emulate their virtues.</p>
            <p>Of this claſs the late Mr. SAMUEL FOTHERGILL, of Warrington, an eminent preacher among the
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:037439_0005_100D42F706E486C0"/>
Quakers, may with great juſtice be ranked. I knew him well, and had the happineſs of his occaſional acquaintance; I call it the happineſs, becauſe I never enjoyed the company of any perſon from whom I received more real ſatisfaction; and however diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſified with affliction, the future part of my life may prove, I ſhall never remember thoſe hours I have ſpent with him, but with peculiar pleaſure. He was an happy compound of the gentleman and the chriſtian; the virtues and amiable qualities of each character being admirably blended in him. Graceful in his deportment, eaſy and affable in his manner, he commanded both reſpect and love; he poſſeſſed natural abilities far ſuperior to the general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of mankind, and improved them to the utmoſt of his power. Well read both in books and men, his ſtudies did not terminate in barren ſpeculation; but the great truths of religion were deeply implanted in his heart, and beamed forth illuſtriouſly in a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent and truly chriſtian conduct.</p>
            <p>As a member of civil ſociety he was exceedingly uſeful, filling up the ſocial and relative duties of life with great propriety. Blameleſs in his manners, kind, charitable, and ready on all occaſions to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote his time and talents to promote the beſt of all
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:037439_0006_100D42F9AB96CC58"/>
cauſes, the good of mankind. He lived beloved, and his loſs is deeply deplored by all who had the happineſs of knowing his worth.</p>
            <p>As a preacher, he was far ſuperior to moſt who fill up that ſtation: Sound in the important doctrines of the chriſtian faith, he endeavoured to promote them univerſally, with the greateſt energy of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and the moſt perſuaſive eloquence. In this capacity he was indeed truly great; and his greatneſs received additional luſtre from his humility. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though followed by numbers, and courted by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of ſuperior rank and ſtation, and admired by thoſe of all perſuaſions, the applauſe which his emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence juſtly acquired, did not exalt, but evidently tended to make him humble. He was a perſon of an enlarged mind, zealous without bigotry, and a ſteady promoter of univerſal charity. In his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, it was evident to all his intelligent hearers that he deeply felt the force of thoſe ſolemn truths he delivered; and his manner of diſplaying them was ſo juſtly emphatical, that none but the inſenſible or obdurate could withſtand their force, or remain unaffected by them. He travelled much from the moſt diſintereſted motives, among his friends in
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:037439_0007_100D42FBC4499C48"/>
Great-Britain, Ireland, and the American Colonies, for the promotion of piety and chriſtian virtue, and for the advancement of that faith and religion in which he moſt ſurely believed, and was ſo eminent an example.</p>
            <p>During the latter part of his life he was much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed in his health; but (as I have heard from the beſt authority) perfectly happy and eaſy in his mind, having an evidence in himſelf that he was approaching that ſtate of felicity which is prepared for the righteous. This evidence ſupported him through the remains of a painful life, and was his unfailing hope in the awful hour of death, which (when near his end) he declared, "Had no terrors, nor would the grave have any victory." And alſo added, "That as he had lived, ſo he ſhould cloſe with the moſt unſhaken aſſurance, that he had not followed cunningly deviſed fables, but the pure li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and eternal ſubſtance." Such was his exemplary life—Such his triumphant death!</p>
            <p>A life ſo ſpent is truly honourable—And ſuch a death unſpeakably glorious.</p>

            <p>ON the 15th inſtant, paid the laſt debt of nature, Mr. SAMUEL FOTHERGILL, of Warrington, an eminent Preacher amongſt the people called Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, endowed with qualifications ſuperior to moſt, and animated by a zeal truly apoſtolic, he long preached the interreſting truths of the goſpel to mankind; whilſt the uniform tenor of his life, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to religion and ſpent in the practice of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry virtue, was the ſtrongeſt comment on his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.</p>

            <head>A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF <hi>SAMUEL FOTHERGILL,</hi> BY HIS BRETHREN IN RELIGIOUS PROFESSION.</head>
            <p>SAMUEL FOTHERGILL, of Warrington in Lancaſhire, was the ſixth ſon of our worthy anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent friend JOHN FOTHERGILL, mentioned in this Treatiſe; ſee page 29, and of MARGARET his wife, for an account of whom ſee volume the ſixth, page 90, of Piety promoted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="x" facs="unknown:037439_0009_100D43002D16D0F0"/>This their ſon being of an active and lively diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and during his apprenticeſhip moſtly from under the watchful eye of his affectionate parent, he fled from the Holy Croſs of CHRIST, and indulged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the gratifications of folly and licentiouſneſs; violating the repeated convictions of divine grace in his own mind, which had been mercifully extended from his early years, thereby wounding the ſoul of his tender father (of whoſe religious care to form and lead the tender minds of his children to piety and virtue, we have an account in the memoirs of his life;) yet his pious admonitions proved never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, as bread caſt on the waters, which returned after many days; for about the twenty-firſt year of his age, the viſitation of divine love was ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully renewed, that it proved effectual to turn his ſteps out of the paths of vanity; and as he has expreſſed, with humble and awful gratitude to the preſerver of men, "It then appeared clear to his underſtanding, that would be the laſt call the heavenly father would ſavour him with;" he therefore conſulted no longer with fleſh and blood, but gave up to the holy viſitation, devoting his whole heart and affections to ſeek reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation with GOD, through the mediation of JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST; and abiding in great humility under the purifying operation of the Holy Ghoſt and fire, he became thereby qualified for thoſe eminent ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he was called into; for in a few months, by the conſtraining power and love of GOD his mouth was opened to bear a teſtimony to the ſufficiency of that
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:037439_0010_100D430280B7B740"/>
holy arm that had plucked him as a brand out of the fire. Thus a diſpenſation of the miniſtry being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his charge, he attended faithfully thereto, and moved therein at the requirings, and under the direction of divine wiſdom, by which means he ſoon became an able miniſter of the goſpel, called thereto and qualified by the Holy Ghoſt, under which influence he laboured with diligence and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted much of his time and ſtrength, when health permitted, to the ſervice of his dear LORD and MASTER; for the continuance of whoſe ſavours he counted nothing too near or dear to part with, that he might be inſtrumental in gathering ſouls to GOD, which was the object he had in view in all his goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel labours; being diligent himſelf, he endeavoured much to excite friends to a due and conſtant atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of meetings for religious worſhip, and thoſe for the diſcipline of the church.</p>
            <p>Through the courſe of his goſpel labours, both in public and private, animated by divine love, he expreſſed an uncommon warmth of affection for the riſing youth of this generation, with whom he has been frequently led into a deep brotherly feeling and ſympathy for their preſent and eternal welfare; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which concern his love to this claſs of both ſexes under all denominations, was ſtrong and ardent.</p>
            <p>He travelled much in this Nation and Scotland, ſeveral times in Ireland, and once through moſt of
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:037439_0011_100D4305D7C32910"/>
the North American Colonies, in the ſervice of truth; where, though ſingularly humbled in a ſenſe of poverty, weakneſs and inſufficiency on his firſt landing, he was by accounts received, marvellouſly ſtrengthened, both in public and private, in goſpel authority and love, to the awakening and comforting of many.</p>
            <p>In the forepart of the year 1769, he viſited moſt of the families of friends in the monthly-meeting of Grace-church ſtreet, London; in which ſervice he was divinely ſtrengthened and enabled to extend a helping hand to many in cloſe and neceſſary labour, for their increaſing care, to live and act conſiſtent with our holy profeſſion, to the comfort and help of divers, and his own peace: and afterwards, at two different opportunities, he viſited the families of friends in Horſleydown and Weſtminſter monthly-meetings in that city, to the ſame good effect.</p>
            <p>He moſtly attended the yearly-meetings in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and other places, when of bodily ability; in which his goſpel labours were very acceptable and edifying; being particularly careful when called from home, to return to his family and friends with as much expedition as the nature of his ſervice would admit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xiii" facs="unknown:037439_0012_100D430763A4F060"/>Having acquired a moderate competency by his diligence and induſtry, he declined trade for ſeveral years before his deceaſe, devoting his time and tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents to the ſervice of the churches. As a pillar in the Lords houſe he was ſtedfaſt, being actuated by a chriſtian and manly zeal; in deportment grave: his private converſation was ſavory and edifying, correſponding with his miniſtry, which at times went forth as a flame, piercing the obdurate, yet deſcended like dew upon the tender plants of our heavenly Fathers planting, the true mourners in Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with theſe he travelled in a deep ſympathy of ſpirit; in his goſpel labours free from affectation, in doctrine clear, found and pathetic, filled with cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, allowing for the prejudices of mankind, being indeed a miniſter and elder worthy of double honour, ſpeaking whereof he knew, and what his own hands had handled of the good word of life.</p>
            <p>He endured a long and painful illneſs with much patience and reſignation, and towards the cloſe of his time expreſſed himſelf to ſome of his relations, when they took leave him, previous to their ſetting out for the yearly-meeting in London, to the following effect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Our health is no more at our command, than length of days:—Mine seems drawing fast towards a conclusions;

               <hi>There is one thing which as an arm underneath, bears up and supports; and though the rolling tempestuous billows surround, yet my head is kept above them, and my feet are firmly established. —O! seek it, —press after it, —lay fast hold of it.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Though painful my nights, and wearisome my days, yet I am preserved in patience and resignation. —Death has no terrors, nor will the grave have any victory. — My soul triumphs over death, hell and the grave.</hi>

               <hi>Husbands and wives, parents and children, health and riches, must all go—disappointment is another name for them.</hi>

               <hi>I should have been thankful had I been able to have got to the ensuing yearly-meeting in London, which you are now going to attend, where I have been so often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed with my brethren; but it is otherwise allotted: I ſhall remember them, and some of them will remember me. —The Lord knows best what is best for us; I am content and resigned to his will.</hi>

               <hi>I should be glad if an easy channel could be found to inform the yearly-meeting that as I have lived, so I shall close, with the most unshaken assurance, that we have not followed cunningly devised fables, but the pure living eternal substance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let the aged be strong, let the middle aged be anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the youth encouraged; for the Lord is still with Zion; the Lord will bless Zion.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>If I be now removed out of his church militant, where I have endeavoured in some measure to fill up my duty, I have an evidence that I shall gain an admittance into his glorious church triumphant, far above the heavens.</hi>

            <head>A DISCOURSE DELIVERED AT BINGLEY, THE 3RD OF THE SEVENTH MONTH, 1758.</head>
            <p>THE excellent proverbs diſcover the full trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of religion with its durable riches and honours; and call ſouls to be true lovers thereof, and to inherit wiſdom. From this holy foundation, the riches of all generations have been drawn; and, whenever we are truly enriched, we muſt derive our treaſure from heaven; for, it is the ſoul that ſhall inherit glory: and where ſhall be the produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of good but in God? There is, beyond all manner of contradiction, abundance of difference in the natural capacities of mankind; in the various advantages or diſadvantages that occur in the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of acquiring knowledge, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of the natural underſtanding; for, ſo it hath ſeemed good and right, in the holy wiſdom of
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:037439_0019_100D431A084F3E38"/>
him who commands the ſpirits to enter into all fleſh, and appoints even the ſtars and heavenly bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to differ in magnitude and glory one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But it admits not of the leaſt doubt with me that the holy one, whoſe ways are equal (and who, with a ſolemn aſſertion, declares, he delights not in the death of them that die) hath formed each of us, however differing in point of capacity or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired knowledge, for glory, honour, immortality, and eternal life, and hath provided means for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining this great and univerſal end. For his will is not our deſtruction, but our ſanctification, our juſtification, and adoption into glory, that we might each of us be happy here, and eternally happy with him for ever.</p>
            <p>That wiſdom which calls us to eternal peace, to inherit ſubſtance, was with the Ancient of Days before the foundations of the world were laid, as one brought up with him and was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him. That attribute of the Almighty, which makes him famous and excellent throughout all his name; that wiſdom in and by which the univerſe was formed, and in which it reſted compleatly beautiful, as coming out of the hands of a pure and holy creator, when the morning ſtars ſung together and the ſons of God ſhouted for joy; this wiſdom, in which all God's workmanſhip was formed, was the great cauſe of their holy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:037439_0020_100D2F36DD5C01A8"/>
and the ſubject of their celeſtial ſong. And all that he has created anew, was by the word of the power and wiſdom of the eternal Son of God, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath revealed himſelf in former ages, firſt ſpeaking by the prophets, at ſundry times and after divers manners, but more clearly by his own appearance, the glorious mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of God in the fleſh, the great myſtery of godlineſs. For ſo it is beyond all controverſy, God was manifeſt in the fleſh, ſeen of angels, worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by them, ſeen of men too, believed on in the world, and received up into glory.</p>
            <p>By this manifeſtation of himſelf, he hath brought hidden riches to light, hath brought life and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality to light by the goſpel. The treaſures hidden from ages and generations, by the goſpel, have been revealed, that life and immortality have been brought to light, which had a being through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all former ages, and was the ancient object of the ſaints' faith under the old diſpenſation of the covenant of works, who ſaw but darkly, and as but in a glaſs; but it is now more clearly revealed. Thou ſhalt guide me by thy counſel, or by thy wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and afterwards receive me into glory. To reſt in hope even in the holy hope of life and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality. But in the fulneſs of time, the rich treaſures of eternity were brought to light, and the veil was taken away from before the face of all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:037439_0021_100D2F3863A79FE0"/>
that they might behold and reſt on him, at whoſe preſence the temple ſhook, when his great and awful concluding work was finiſhed, and he gave up the ghoſt. The veil was in great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure rent at the appearance of that glorious one, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in a greater degree, by that propitiatory ſacrifice offered to Eternal Wiſdom; but more abundantly at the pouring forth of the Holy Ghoſt, at the day of pentecoſt; when ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers from all parts heard ſpoken, in their own language the wonderful things of God.</p>
            <p>Now it is this word of God, this wiſdom, that was hid from ages, by which the treaſures of all mankind have been filled, the rich treaſures of all generations, have been repleniſhed. And, as I am fully perſuaded, that the greateſt part of thoſe who have fallen from him, may lay claim to that ſacred, that adorable, name of Chriſt Jeſus; I would adviſe each particular perſon, who have made a profeſſion of this glorious and adorable name, to put the queſtion to themſelves, what por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of riches they have obtained through a profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this word of wiſdom? For it ſtands us in ſtead to know what we are, before the fatal ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence be paſſed upon us; every one muſt ſtand before the righteous and juſt judge; for, if Noah, Daniel and Job, who were preachers of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, were with us, in the days of viſions, they
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:037439_0022_100D431EF5F63D50"/>
could only ſave their own ſouls. What better am I for my profeſſion of the chriſtian faith? "Is my ſalvation nearer than when I firſt believed? or (in the ancient language of the apoſtles to the primitive proſelytes to chriſtianity) have you received the Holy Ghoſt ſince you firſt believed? It is a query, as meet to be put, and as neceſſary to be aſked, of each one of us, as ever it was ſince "life and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality were brought to light by the goſpel."</p>
            <p>I am ſenſible there are great numbers of mankind who are unbelievers in the gift of the Holy Ghoſt. In the extenſion of that great and holy gift, that excellent treaſure, Chriſt in us the ſole crown and hope of glory; and wherever unbelief prevails, in the real extending of this excellent gift, one may ſay, in the apoſtle's language, how then ſhall they call upon him in whom they have not believed? Some are pleaſed to call it preſumption in this day to ſpeak of this gift of the Holy Ghoſt; ſome are ready to ſay, we have no ſcripture for it; but thanks be to God, we have; unleſs they be opened to us by him that had the key of David, we ſhall never availably profit by them. The unlearned in all ages, down to this day, have been ſaid to wreſt the ſcriptures; and ſome have wreſted them to their own deſtruction. But who are thoſe unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Are they ſuch as are deprived of ſcholaſtic education, that have not opportunity of acquiring
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037439_0023_100D432205DAB3F8"/>
knowledge and underſtanding through literature? No, for, in the courſe of my obſervation, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> with reſpect to the ſacred truths of the goſpel, all muſt acknowledge they are unlearned whoſe hearts are not opened by the key of David, in which are all the treaſures of wiſdom and knowledge, which is as "a lamp to our feet and as a light to our paths." But where ſhall we find the learned? We ſhall find them amongſt the diſciples of Jeſus, learned in the ſchool of experience, who, out of the good treaſure put into their hearts from the ancient Spring of Eternal Riches, are bringing forth things new and old. We ſhall find them amongſt the poor of the earth, frequently rich in faith, for, the ſecrets of the Almighty are with thoſe who fear him; and, the Lion, related in the character of the tribe of Judah, with whom is the key of David, opens the book and unlooſes the ſeals thereof.</p>
            <p>I have frequently ſeen thoſe amongſt the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er claſs of mankind who are the more truly learned; and it appears to me an improper term, to call men learned in the things of God, whilſt they are vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly delighting in iniquity, and are lovers of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure more than followers after him; theſe, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlearned, wreſt the ſcriptures as unlearned, even to their own deſtruction. Therefore let not the meaneſt amongſt you ſay, that I have not ſuch
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037439_0024_100D4324E5D9C220"/>
advantages as others; I am unlearned, I am in obſcurity and darkneſs, in the neceſſitous circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of life; and therefore this my ſituation is cutting me off from thoſe benefits that redound to others, who are in a capacity by acquired know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and experience, to form to themſelves encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging apprehenſions of theſe great things of eternal ſalvation, and of obtaining a ſhare in that wiſdom which is unchangeable in its nature, and of everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing duration. The word of Eternal Wiſdom, when he had taken upon him that body (as in the volume of the book it is written of him) he was converſant amongſt the poor, they being the people with whom the Heir of all Things principally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted; for, amongſt thoſe he would have conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with, who were of the chief prieſts and rulers; did ever any of them believe in him? No, for thoſe thought themſelves wiſe, and ſought not to know him, the eternal fountain of everlaſting joy. Me-thinks I would have all nations to conſider themſelves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to have a part in the unſpeakable wiſdom and mercy of God, in the offers of grace, and in the glorious riches of an eternal kingdom, which is prepared for all thoſe who ſincerely love him. That they are deſigned, in abundant kindneſs, to become heirs with Chriſt of that glory which is unſpeakable; and, from ſuch a perſuaſion of mind, be awakened to conſider the means which lead to this bleſſed end. And, in order thereto, that we may know to whom
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037439_0025_100D432671814F30"/>
we appertain, we are told of the abſolute neceſſity of the gift of the Holy Ghoſt, that even they who have not the ſpirit of Chriſt are none of his.</p>
            <p>I would again ſay, let not a ſpirit of unbelief, with reſpect to this holy gift, enter into the hearts of mankind; for I am bold to aſſert, that if the gift of the Holy Ghoſt be not continued in this day of Jeſus Chriſt, that great and glorious light, it is certainly the darkeſt diſpenſation that ever yet was amongſt mankind: if the ſacred almighty Fountain of Eternal excellency, does not communicate knowledge, underſtanding and wiſdom, by his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, through the word of eternal righteouſneſs, the chriſtian world is, above all other diſpenſations, the darkeſt and moſt miſerable; for, before the flood, he graciouſly condeſcended to converſe with man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind about theſe great truths: he clothed them in their ſtations with wiſdom adapted to their ſtate, when the iniquity of the people was great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly offenſive, which cauſed him to pour forth upon the earth a deluge of water, that deſtroyed them; even previous to that he warned them by his prophets, whom he had made preachers of righteouſneſs. And afterwards, when the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah ſinned, when their cries aſcended, in heavy piercing prophanation of the commandment of God, and enter'd into the ears of the great Governor of the World, he held, as it
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037439_0026_100D4328EF637840"/>
were, a conſultation; and ſaid, I will go down now, and fee whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it which is come up unto me. He warned them from time to time of the impending danger which threatened them: he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered Iſrael in Egypt, and regarded them in the wilderneſs with unſpeakable kindneſs; he gave them the laws upon Mount Sinai with unſpeakable marks of his own communication and excellency: but, when they tranſgreſſed againſt him, he hewed them by his prophets, and flew them by the words of his mouth; they had the law delivered to them with awful ſolemnity, and in a manner unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly true, to thoſe who were appointed for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication thereof. Moreover he ſuperſeded the law that was written by a new train of his holy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, whom he raiſed and ſent forth; what for? To ſpread the ſame and power of religion amongſt all mankind, and direct them to the great and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious end of their being. And ſhall we conclude that under the glorious diſpenſations of Jeſus, which hath been ratified and confirmed, not with the blood of bulls or of goats, or with the oblations and ſacrifices that were only typical, but with the precious blood of the Lamb, "ſlain from the foundation of the world," that council, wiſdom, and heavenly inſtruction, ſhould be withheld, or the means of proclaiming afreſh, in his goſpel, the ſpirit of life in every creature? I again ſay, take
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037439_0027_100D432A84D0D578"/>
away the gift and extenſion of the Holy Ghoſt, and we ſhould be more in ignorance and darkneſs than the ages of former diſpenſations; but thanks be to him who lives forever, we have ground to believe and to be aſſured, that the diſpenſation of the goſpel is a diſpenſation of life through Jeſus Chriſt, and far ſuperior in glory to any that ever was before.</p>
            <p>This is the new covenant, even his law that he would put in their inward parts, and write in their hearts, and would be their God and they ſhould be his people; with it he would give them an additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal degree of knowledge, acceſs to, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with, himſelf. I do not apprehend it to be a mere enlargement of men's natural powers or reaſon, that was the gift of wiſdom given to the children of men, through the meritorious atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt; they had the exerciſe of the ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al faculties; they had a capacity and powers of diſcerning conſiſtent with their ſtate: their concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and apprehenſions were proportioned to them as the beings of a day; but there ſeems to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a higher nature requiſite in that ſtate of light and knowledge, propoſed through the goſpel of Jeſus, which was for the ſpreading that excellent wiſdom which is from above, which is firſt pure and peaceable, then gentle and eaſy to be intreated;
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:037439_0028_100D432DD68438A0"/>
that wiſdom which is divine in itſelf in all its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, and gives them power to inherit ſubſtance.</p>
            <p>We are abundantly told, and it is a truth we can never too much rely upon, that the manifeſtation of the ſpirit is given to every man to profit withal; that the gift of the Holy Ghoſt was proportioned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the everlaſting eternal intereſt of man; and hath been communicated to the various claſſes of men's underſtandings, that they might be united to him, and learn righteouſneſs; that thoſe who have wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered from the fold of reſt, might be brought to Chriſt, the everlaſting Shepherd and Biſhop of Souls. This is the glory of the goſpel of Jeſus, this is that which makes him excellent through all his attributes, and unſpeakably glorious throughout his name, "that he came to ſeek and ſave that which was loſt, to bring home that which ſtrayed, to bind up that which hath been broken, and to enlighten thoſe who had long ſat in darkneſs, with the glorious brightneſs of an everlaſting day."</p>
            <p>In a juſt ſenſe of the value of my own ſoul, and of each particular amongſt you, do I ſpeak:—Have you brought your actions to the final deciſion of unchangeable truth and righteouſneſs? have you received the Holy Ghoſt ſince you firſt believed? After what manner is the gift of the Holy Ghoſt given to the children of men? What is its firſt
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037439_0029_100D432F64FD48B8"/>
work, what is the firſt progreſs that the Holy Ghoſt makes? Heaven, earth, ſea, and the fountains of water, prompt me to ſome degree of experience, and I am qualified to anſwer, from faith, in the query; for, I am not amongſt you without experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, according to my capacity, and I ſpeak forth the things which mine eyes have ſeen and looked upon, not in a tranſient view; but what my hands have handled of the good word and power of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, I proclaim amongſt you. After what manner did the Holy Ghoſt operate on its firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance amongſt the children of men? Why, in the ſame manner that it did upon the world in the work of the creation, when it was firſt and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally formed: for at the production of divine power, in the wonderful work of creation, the word was "let there be light" and there was light. He ſaid, and it was done; he ſpoke and it came to paſs. And, in this goſpel day, this glorious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of grace and mercy, the word is "let there be light" to enlighten their underſtanding to give the knowledge of themſelves, that it might ſhew to us that whatever ſeeming dignity we may be willing to aſſume, whatever miſtaken views we have taken of ourſelves, however comely we may have appeared, in deluſive apprehenſions, yet, in the ſight of him who created all things, the people of all nations, and the numberleſs hoſts on high, whilſt in our natural ſtates and circumſtances, we
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037439_0030_100D4331F88B5F50"/>
are but void and without form; not yet, inſtampt with that divine and celeſtial image, which is only capable of celeſtial glory.</p>
            <p>Whatever degrees of underſtanding and of natural knowledge; whatever perfection of human wiſdom, and experience, and accompliſhments of profeſſion; O man! O woman! to what length ſoever thou haſt attained, thou art ſtill the creating work of Eternal Wiſdom; he hath furniſhed thee with all theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and powers for a noble purpoſe, and hath furniſhed thee with a capacity for thoſe glorious views of eternity, and the excellent frame that abides for ever. Thou art "without form and void," al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there may be ſome ſeeming production that may ſtrike thy fancy and flatter ſelf-love, yet I fear thou art deficient and without form and void. But God ſaid "let there be light," and there was light; he ſpoke, and it was inſtantaneouſly brought forth at his command, and he who effected the great cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating work of all things at the beginning, has ſaid, "let there be light," and there is light throughout theſe latter ages, to diſcover to mankind their own ſtate and condition; how it is in the ſight of Eternal Purity, who looks, not as man looks, but beholds the hearts of the children of men, with reſpect to his ſacred attributes of knowledge and virtue, as he did at the firſt. "Shall I (ſays God) count them pure with the wicked balance, and with the bag of
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037439_0031_100D43350F72BE10"/>
deceitful weights; and while the veil is over all nations, while groſs darkneſs covers their hearts, are they not pleaſing themſelves with uſing a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful balance, which, in the end, will be found wanting."</p>
            <p>But, "let there be light," to the perfect diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of their undone ſtate and condition, in which they appear, in the ſight of an awful and righteous Judge, who will "render to every man according to his deeds." Oh, may the light of the morning of the day of the Lord dawn upon your ſouls, and ariſe higher and higher; may it ſhine brighter and brighter, till it is finally ſwallowed up in the bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ocean of everlaſting day, where there is no darkneſs, no night, no ſun nor moon, but where is the everlaſting habitation of the Lord God and the Lamb, who are the perpetual light of the whole community.</p>
            <p>Have not we known a portion of this ſacred hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly light in our own hearts? Yes verily; I dare appeal to the experience of all who have, in any degree, been brought to ſee the bitterneſs of their own ſtates, when conſcience hath ſecretly viſited them; how often hath it reproved you, how often hath it awfully founded in the ears of thy firſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, "Adam where art thou?" It was at the firſt interview between our Lord and Adam, when he
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037439_0032_100D4336A9E72470"/>
called to him, after the defection and departure from that wiſdom that covenanted And formed man and all things. The all-wiſe Creator did not want to know where his creature Adam was, no, but that his deeds might be made manifeſt to him by by the light, in order to awake him from inſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. O, ſon of Adam, where art thou? what is thy ſtate? what is thy circumſtance? what is the end of thy being? how is that great and important end kept in view? Thus the queſtion has been propoſed to the ſons of Adam in this day. Is not the ſtate in which Adam was, thy own ſtate? Oh, ſon of Adam, "where art thou?"</p>
            <p>"I heard (ſays Adam) thy voice in the garden, and I hid myſelf." Oh lamentable change! Oh! the diſtance between the creature and the Creator! by whom he was formed in innocency, brought up amongſt the conſtellations of heaven, endued with a capacity for the everlaſting contemplation of infinite perfections; placed in paradiſe, and bleſſed with immortality: but why this diſtance? why this fleeing from God? why the ſacred intercourſe interrupted, and the eternal joy gone? His nakedneſs was the cauſe; ſhame, ariſing from the guilt of conſcience, for the breach of the divine law, drives him from the face of the divine preſence. Oh, ſon of Adam, where art thou? "I hid myſelf," ſaid he, guilt had taken hold, "I hid myſelf." It is the ſame with all
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:037439_0033_100D4338E8ED0530"/>
the children of Adam, when the womb of the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing opens upon them, and preſents to them their own ſtates, and puts the awful query,—O ſon of Adam, where art thou? They are aſhamed to own the glorious voice, and, from conſciouſneſs of guilt, with ſhame, appear before their Almighty father and friend: "I hid myſelf;" it was a term never heard of in the innocency of creation. But man fallen into ſin, a defection and departure from the Lord God enſued, and inſtead of living in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Eternal Creator, he was aſhamed and hid himſelf.—O, ſon of Adam where art thou? And thus the reſt of mankind, the progeny of Adam, are the ſame in the ſtate of nature, from one generation to another. They would hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the face of that God with whom we have to do, the clear diſcoveries of the heavenly light is unwelcome to them becauſe it brings a degree of horror, letting them ſee miſery on the one hand, and happineſs on the other. But it's glorious deſcent and operation affords wiſdom from day to day, unto thoſe whom that God would form to himſelf, who always knows what is in man, and what there is to be formed in him to his own image. But ye ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the light, that ſacred operation of the divine and heavenly light, the righteouſneſs and wiſdom of God and Chriſt, which is the true light; and are not convinced of your own unrighteouſneſs and folly. This was the unhappy ſtate of Ahab, king
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:037439_0034_100D433A858B1910"/>
of Iſrael, when he was ſurrounded with multitudes of prophets, who with flattering ſuggeſtions, ſpoke ſmooth things to him. They told him he might go and proſper. He approved of their counſel, and their tidings were pleaſing: but what they prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied to him were lies; theſe wicked ones that he conſulted were very many: but was there no other prophet in Iſrael? Yes, there was one prophet of the Lord's, that declared truth, to whom God the Father had given the ſpirit of propheſy; he was capable of being an inſtrument, in the hand of the Lord, to give to others ſound counſel, and not to flatter, as Ahab's four hundred prophets did. This man of God, when he came, declared that the controverſy of the Moſt High was againſt him: this was diſpleaſing to Ahab, and when Jehoſhaphat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired after a prophet of the Lord's, he replied "there is yet one, but I hate him; for, he doth not propheſy good things concerning me."</p>
            <p>But ſuch are the good things which the language of wiſdom hath ſpoken againſt the unwearied whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perings of the enemy of mankind; and, when the affections are vitiated, and the heavenly reliſh loſt, the underſtanding, will and judgment, are often aſſaulted and baffled, by the prince and power of darkneſs; and although there are multitudes of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies combining againſt us, yet the eternal, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, and everlaſting Wiſdom condeſcends to
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:037439_0035_100D433DC9498488"/>
teach, us the ſolemn truths of his kingdom; and his voice has been like thoſe awful awakening claps of thunder in our ears, which formerly ſhook the top of trembling Sinai. The deceitful counſel, from the falſe prophets' mouths, was believed and obeyed, while the prophet of the Lord, though telling truth was rejected and abhorred. "I hate him" ſaid Ahab; but notwithſtanding this declenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he delivers his meſſage from God, however contradictory to the inclination of Ahab. But mark the conſequence; he ordered them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him to priſon, and to feed him with the bread of affliction and the water of affliction, till he ſhould return in peace. Oh, remember the anſwer, with trembling, all ye wanton aſpirers, who are deſpiſing the counſel of God! Remember, the Lord Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and his commandments, and thoſe by whom he ſends, from the firſt morning of creation unto the dawning of the day of eternity; "If thou return at all in peace," (ſays the prophet) thou that tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleſt on the word of God, "the Lord hath not ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by me." And it is moſt unqueſtionably true, and juſtly applicable to thoſe who depart from the word of the Lord; they can never return to the truth and inherit peace, unleſs they feel and know the divine operation of the ſpirit of truth in their hearts. For in how tranſient a light doth profeſſion appear in the natural man, when no other way has been caſt up for him; and a profeſſion, adapted to
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:037439_0036_100D4340C62CCB98"/>
the moſt perfect ſyſtem of religion, will do nothing for us in a day that is haſtily approaching, without the power of life and godlineſs is inherent in the ſoul. Open iniquity has ſlain its thouſands, but this formality hath ſlain its tens of thouſands.</p>
            <p>I fear there are more who go down to the duſt cloathed with the profeſſion of religion only, than thoſe who poſſeſs the life and ſubſtance of it; of thoſe who have only the law in their mouths, than of thoſe who have it written in their hearts. And whatever advantages mankind tranſgreſs againſt, whether greater or leſs, ſo will their proportion of reward be. God hath let ſome ſee their own fatal condition, who would have a good work wrought in them, through their own activity and wiſdom. —I will be religious. I will hear. I will read. I will collect ſome ſyſtems of religion into my head. I have been unacquainted with myſelf; but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold my undone ſtate and condition, and now I will be more religious. Thus all things may appear well for a ſeaſon; there may ſeem to be a change wrought in us, an abhorrence to that which is evil, and a love to that which is good; there may be a deſire to enter the inward courts of the temple, to aſſume the name and character of true chriſtians, and be active in religious duties; but unleſs theſe reſolutions be aided by divine grace, it will not be a laſting change, it will be ſoon over, and like untimely fruit, never
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:037439_0037_100D43424FCAE478"/>
arrive at maturity and perfection. For the paths that lead to bleſſedneſs are ſtill the ſame, and the only true chriſtian religion is according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward covenant of grace, which ſtands not in words, but in power, and in much aſſurance of the power of the Holy Ghoſt By this you are guided and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected in your way, and by its ſanctifying virtue, are made like Chriſt. Without this, you are only in the exterior courts of the temple, in the outward profeſſion of religion only, and in a name to live, when alas! you have been dead; the old nature of the old man ſtill remains, and "the voice is the voice of Jacobs, though the hands are the hands of Eſau."</p>
            <p>Great is this myſtery, and unfathomable to the natural mind; it cannot be comprehended but by thoſe who have the light which ſhines from above, the light of eternal wiſdom. None but thoſe who have this great work begun in them can lay claim to the glorious character of being "children of God," and heirs of the kingdom of light and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality. It is poſſible for people to make a lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble profeſſion of religion, and not to have come to the ſaving knowledge of the truth; for, the nobleſt confeſſion with the lips, without a renewed and ſanctified heart, is abſolutely offenſive to that God with whom we have to do, who "weigheth the mountains in ſcales and the hills in a balance."
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:037439_0038_100D434503641A60"/>
But when the holy light ſhines forth in the underſtanding, and ſhews them, that their own ſtrength is weakneſs, folly and inſufficiency; and they ſee ſin and iniquity exceeding deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, then they not only ſee, but deſire, "to flee from the wrath to come," to be preſerved and kept from the powerful attacks of the prince of darkneſs, who has ſeized multitudes of mankind in the uncleanneſs of converſation. He that firſt ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, with the temptation, in Eden, has again aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted, with the ſame violence as heretofore, and the miſtaken ſouls, who by their own workings, think they have made a tranſition from that wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtate, may perhaps be got farther in the land of infatuation in ſin and uncleanneſs with the falſe prophet.— "And I beheld three unclean ſpirits like frogs that came out of the mouth of the beaſt, and out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the falſe prophets; theſe three unclean ſpirits are the ſpirits of the devil, and unto them were ſeemingly committed the power of working miracles, in imitation of the miraculous power of the Son of God." But were their profeſſion of power and wiſdom weighed in the balance of the ſanctuary, and viewed by the light of the goſpel, it would be found no more than preſumption. And unleſs they can approve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by thoſe marks which are laid down in the goſpel, it is no better for them than if they had lived in open uncleanneſs. For thoſe he hath ſent
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:037439_0039_100D434730C22D80"/>
forth to boaſt in their own righteouſneſs, to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to their own nets, and to burn incenſe to their own drags, ſaying, "my own right-hand hath ſaved me." To value themſelves on the achievements of their own ſtrength and wiſdom, when it is no more than this baſe reſtleſs ſpirit that comes out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beaſt, and out of the mouth of the falſe prophet. And what is it for? it is to gather the people together againſt the great day of the battle of the Lord; to bring the poor deluded multitudes of mankind to truſt in a broken reed, and in a ſtaff that will pierce through their hands; to gather together the nations of them that forgot God, againſt the great and awful day of the Lord Almighty, when paleneſs of face, and feebleneſs of hands, ſhall come upon them, when the higheſt cedars, and the moſt exalted and haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty children of men, will be as ſtubble, caſt before a terrible and devouring fire, when he appears, in tempeſtuous rage, to ſhake terribly the earth.</p>
            <p>O, have a care of being found in a courſe of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, and in ſeeking to place your happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and dependence in a falſe and groundleſs ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of men's devices; but remember that your all, your everlaſting all, is at ſtake. Remember with trembling, that if after you have eſcaped the pollutions of the world, through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, you be again
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:037439_0040_100D434A49672A60"/>
entangled; the latter end will be worſe than the beginning, and lamentable will be your portion in time and in eternity.</p>
            <p>It therefore requires the utmoſt application of every ſoul "to add unto their faith virtue, and unto virtue knowledge, and unto knowledge tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, and unto temperance patience, and unto patience godlineſs, and unto godlineſs brotherly kindneſs, and unto brotherly kindneſs charity." I would have no ſoul to apprehend that I leſſen, or would leſſen, purity and holineſs of life upon the face of the earth; but that purity and holineſs of the heart, might be renewed, and changed into the glorious and heavenly image, by the ſpirit of God. The law of the ten commandments muſt be abſolute neceſſity, obligatory to men, in their ſpiritual ſtate; and, to us, it is an holy and abundant precept, though, in ſome, it is loſt. There is an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate alluſion to all this ſhewed forth, by us, as were by the children of Iſrael, who made to themſelves idols, and inſcribed upon them the name of God, though it were and is expreſsly declared, "thou ſhalt not make unto thyſelf any likeneſs of any thing that is in heaven above or in the earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, to worſhip it." But we are aſſured, that amongſt the chriſtian names there are ſome that are making to themſelves the likeneſs of ſomething in heaven; and this is not known but as we come to
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:037439_0041_100D434C55C8D7E0"/>
attend to the heavenly teacher and ſpirit of God; for, ſome return again to their folly, and wallow in their filth and pollution; but unleſs they are renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and born anew they cannot inherit heaven, and all the glorious treaſures of an everlaſling king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>There are ſome who are contriving and engraving idols; that are making to themſelves an image, or likeneſs to ſomething; as faith, hope, and charity, the great and glorious characters engraved on the true chriſtians; and glorious riches they are, pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar treaſures, and ineſtimable pearls, which never fail. Now ſuch as theſe, ſome have only made ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of, they have a notion that they call faith which is only opinion inſtead of hope; they have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing they call hope, but it is no more than expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; and, inſtead of charity, that is of eternal duration, that love which abides for ever; inſtead of this excellent grace, they have erected an idol which is nothing but ſelf-love. Theſe dead images have taken place, they are, and have been, too much reſting in them in all parts of the chriſtian world, and many have made to themſelves theſe images and likeneſſes to worſhip them, have been bowing down to them of all profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, of all names and diſtinctions in the world; and all nations will (unto the final conſummation of terreſtrial things) continue in this fatal miſtaken notion till Chriſt enters into their hearts; and then
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:037439_0042_100D434E167FA0D8"/>
Chriſt the king of glory will give them light, and as the morning ſtar of eternal day, he will become precious, ever riſing and ſhining with celeſtial brightneſs, till the day be dawned, and "the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtar ariſe in their hearts," to be their light and their lamb for ever.</p>
            <p>But, alas! opinion with ſome has paſſed for faith; they hear the doctrine and ſucceſs of the goſpel of the holy Jeſus, and aſſent thereto; they believe in notion and confeſs with their lips all the truths of the goſpel, all his glorious perfections, yet all this may be mere tradition by which the heart is not bettered by the things which are declared; but if to the great truths of the goſpel of the holy Jeſus they can yield the aſſent of their judgment, if, by true faith, they receive them, and make them, through divine aſſiſtance, their own, not merely flattering themſelves with the glorious proſpect of immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but are embracing them, by the ſanctifying ſpirit that leads to the ſacred one; then it is by faith we lay hold on Jeſus and on theſe great things of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life. By faith a glorious conqueſt is won; by faith we aſcend through the various gradations of purity, from victory to victory, and from ſtrength to ſtrengh, till faith gives us the victory over this world and over ſin, carrying on to the glorious completion of the chriſtian warfare, and fitting us for an everlaſting union with the triumphant hoſt who have overcome the world. This is the faith
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:037439_0043_100D4350860DAEC0"/>
that works by love to the purifying of the heart; but inſtead of this faith ſome are erecting an image only, and yet are arguing for the verity of it, and and ſay it is real and ſubſtantial, when it is only an opinion; but ſuch, whatever they ſay, whatever they think, they know not that their ſalvation muſt be wrought out by faith, being ſtrengthened by the ſpirit of God.</p>
            <p>And thus thouſands have been led into idolatry and have created to themſelves an image only, when their hearts have not known any thing of faith in Chriſt, going on from faith to faith, from ſtrength to ſtrength, and from grace to grace. Oh! it is lamentable to hear ſpread the mournful tidings of the prevalence of image worſhip, which has ſeduced many from their proper work and buſineſs, to enter themſelves on that which will fatally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them in the end. How lamentably doth David repreſent idolatrous worſthip; "God forbid that I ſhould offer to the Lord God, or ſpread among the people, a ſacrifice of any vile thing" as ſome have done, when at the ſame time they have had no manner of experience, no inward know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but the heart hath given the tongue the lie. I fear this is the caſe with many in this profeſſing age, and I am convinced that whatever name they bear, if it is not received from heaven, it is no more than opinion that hath paſſed with them for the
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:037439_0044_100D435443ADD178"/>
faith, and the names they bear are like a name un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known. It is certain that there are ſuch that have pleaſed themſelves with a profeſſion of truth, yet have not witneſſed it in their experience. I think they cannot be juſtly compared to the Samaritans, whom the woman called to ſee a man that told her all that ever ſhe had done; they believed, and their opinion was founded on the report: there, ſeemed to be a pretty honeſt conviction, yet they were not contented therewith, for the foundation of their faith, till they came and converſed with him them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; then ſaid they to the woman, "Now we believe, not becauſe of thy report, for we have heard him ourſelves and know that this is indeed the Chriſt the Saviour of the world."</p>
            <p>Now, my friends, you that proſeſs chriſtianity, what is the ground of your faith? Is it the report of them that have known whereof they ſpake? Is it the mere report and teſtimony of former genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; or have you heard the voice of Chriſt, and does he live in you the hope of glory? The holy ſcriptures are an excellent corroborating ſtream, wherein I can view Chriſt, and the compellations of his love, which is of the ſame efficacy as in former ages. It is not becauſe I have heard tell thereof; but I have felt it, I have drawn nigh to him in the humbling experience of its enlivening motives; and worſhip him, not only as the deſire of former ages,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:037439_0045_100D4355CFD02C08"/>
but as the preſent glory of his people. I can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him as my God, my hope, my help, my heavenly father and friend, and the conſtant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of my ways through the wilderneſs of this world.</p>
            <p>Here is the ground of faith, the living ſaving faith, in which the righteous are eſtabliſhed, built up, and comfortably edifyed for the everlaſting kingdom; in the living knowledge of what he is now to them, and in the divine aſſurance of what he will be, when all ages and generations ſhall be ſwallowed up in the eternal day, when they will, by advancing from one progreſſion to another, lay hold on eternal glory, and can ſay, in the ſolemn language of the apoſtles, "We are not come to the mount that might be touched and that burned with fire and brimſtone, nor unto blackneſs, and darkneſs, and tempeſt, nor unto the ſound of the trumpet, and the voice of words, which voice was ſo terrible that thoſe who heard entreated that the word ſhould not be ſpoken to them any more; ſo terrible was the ſight, that Moſes ſaid, I exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly quake and fear: "but we are come," by the excerciſe of divine faith, "unto Mount Sion," unto the holy city of the living God, and to the boundleſs fruition of unſpeakable joy; we are come "to the new Jeruſalem, to the general aſſembly, and church of the firſt born, and to the ſpirits of
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:037439_0046_100D435828F4C978"/>
juſt men made perfect," and all the united conflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the angelic hoſt. O bleſſed are they who are fitted for that excellent and glorious habitation, where the ſons of wiſdom have eternal abode.</p>
            <p>This appears to have been the joyful experience of the primitive chriſtian believers. Their faith laid hold on, and, by their experience, they knew that they were come to Mount Sion. They had that treaſure in earthen veſſels, the excellency whereof was not of man, but God; and as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive deſcendants of that illuſtrious and royal race, they knew, from a degree of divine aſſurance, that they abode in him, and when their earthly taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle was diſſolved, and the immortal inhabitant diſlodged from its fabrick of clay, that a building of God was prepared for them, "an houſe not made with hands, but eternal in the heavens;" and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this excellent and glorious abode they preſſed forward.</p>
            <p>Now mere opinion cannot lay claim to theſe great and excellent promiſes; I will tell you how far it will reach; it reaches often too far, and exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits a miſtaken proſpect to the deluded minds; they are deſirous after happineſs, but their deſires are founded on ſelf-love. "Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my latter end be like unto his;" let my habitation be in the land of eternal quietude.
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:037439_0047_100D435A83A5C6E0"/>If this is only the language of ſelf-love, they who ſpeak it, ever delight in that which is evil, and flee that which is painful to nature, and ſhun the croſs of Chriſt. They can deſire after heaven, let my habitation be in the land of eternal quietude; but let them remember that fleſh and blood can never enter the kingdom of God. Thus they have been brought to farther miſtakes reſpecting their conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; they have miſtaken their deſires to be heavenly, out whilſt their deſires were after heaven, they have been poſſeſſing the corruptions of their nature, and have been eſtabliſhed in no manner of meetneſs for the inheritance of his ſaints in the light, for the glorious fellowſhip of the bleſſed above. They think they are well on their way to the kingdom of God; but oh, that they may open their eyes before they are cloſed to the world, and their immortal ſpirits entered into the confines of a boundleſs eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Oh; that they may ſee that their minds are anſanctified, and that their hearts muſt be created anew in righteouſneſs and true holineſs, before they can be clothed with the garment and brightneſs of the Lamb. They deſire it may be well with them; opinion can lead to this; but it is faith that can purify the heart; this faith is effectual, it works by love, it has a happy operation on their lives, it kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles heavenly deſires, opens a fountain of purity and ſanctification to the ſoul, from which fountain ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and flows forth every excellent ſtream. Oh that ye might be brought into this holy heavenly frame
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:037439_0048_100D435C0E083578"/>
of ſpirit. Here you can have living deſires after heaven and happineſs, not merely an exemption from trouble, ſorrow, pain, uneaſineſs, and vexation; but a place of happineſs, a land of conſummate purity, of peaceful and celeſtial reſt.</p>
            <p>Can opinion avail itſelf by deſires and expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? No, has not expectation paſt for hope as well as opinion paſt for faith? Yes, all flatter themſelves with a hope in Chriſt in an awful approaching mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but let me ſay, it is a truth that is eternal in its duration, and will abide forever, that no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation that is built upon mere opinion, will ever bring us to everlaſting glory. There may be an expectation, that is, a paſſion of the mind, that ariſes after ſome object to which it has no immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate relation or fitneſs, but is in degree intercepted, and thus they deceive themſelves; for the mind being unrenewed, there is not a poſſibility of the true hope being admitted, and that which they call hope is but a mere empty expectation, that will fatally deceive them; at the laſt day we muſt be made ſenſible of the worth of, and be made meet and fit for, the object of hope ſet before us, before ever we can receive that "hope which is an anchor to the ſoul, and keeps it ſure and ſtedfaſt" amidſt the tempeſtuous commotions of an uncertain world. This keeps the ſoul in heavenly relation to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of ſpirits, and gives it an admittance into the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:037439_0049_100D435FD0EFBD38"/>
holy myſteries that are within the veil. That glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious God who created all things out of nothing, can by that power which made us in his likeneſs, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late us from death and darkneſs into the kingdom of his marvellous light, the glorious gates ſtand open night and day, yet there is nothing unclean, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified, or impure; "nothing that worketh an abomination or maketh a lye," ſhall ever enter.</p>
            <p>Let us attend to the operation of hope, amongſt the primitive believers, and try whether the paſſion of the mind, which we call hope, be attended with the ſame happy effect as theirs; "what manner of love is this (ſaid they) wherewith the heavenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath loved us, that we ſhould be called the ſons of God? They readily owned they knew not what they ſhould be when clothed with immortality, or in what ſphere of celeſtial glory they were to move.</p>
            <p>"We know not what we ſhall be (ſaid they) with reſpect to the reſurrection of the body; but this we know, that when Chriſt appears, we ſhall be like him as he is." Whence proceeds this knowledge, but from the happy teſtimony of a holy conformity to his life. This was the happy effect of this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent hope, and "he that hath this hope in Chriſt purifieth himſelf even as he is pure." He that hath this hope in Chriſt, this glorious hope, has the immortal riches, the enduring treaſure, that was hid from former generations, even "Chriſt in
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:037439_0050_100D436196F97458"/>
them the" ſole "hope of eternal glory." He that hath this hope keepeth himſelf pure, for he knows the habitation of peace and purity, is the habitation of them that are ſanctified.</p>
            <p>This is the nature and conſtitution of hope, it is lead by an eye of faith: faith looks on and aſſents to; and hope, with the hand, lays hold and faſtens on the prize. He that hath this hope in Chriſt purifieth himſelf even as he is pure, according to his degrees of ſtrength and knowledge; for he knows that holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is inſcribed on every ſanctified veſſel in the Lord's houſe, and that nothing which is unholy can ever enter there. For the Lord ſhall be unto them an everlaſting light, and their God their glory. And charity, that love of God, which remains when faith and hope will be ſwallowed up in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly viſion, and complete fruitions of the divinely excellent and glorious object; this charity, that is divinely pure, has been counterfeited with an image of ſelf-love, which has been made amongſt the children of men, and ſet up in opinions. "I am of Paul, I am of Apollos," I am of this or the other party, of this or the other name and diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: thus hath this image been erected and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, inſtead of the divine charity that abides for ever, that keeps the heart pure and clean, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhes it upon a glorious and unchangeable object. They have been centering themſelves in their own
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:037439_0051_100D4365DBC4A098"/>
narrow conceptions, feeking their own things, and not the things of Chriſt; thus, neglecting the great things of their eternal happineſs, they have ſound themſelves empty, void, and without form, Theſe drink and yet are thirſty, they eat and are not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and are heaping up their treaſure in unfound bags that will not hold it. They are making a profeſſion of Religion, without the life and ſubſtance of it; they dream of much, but lo it will come to little; and, with reſpect to the great things of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, will be unprofitable, and their worſhip is an untimely fruit in the ſight of the great and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Majeſty on high.</p>
            <p>May the law of the Lord enter into your hearts, to convince you of ſin, of righteouſneſs, and of judgment to come, that you may ſee your ſtate, while the day of bleſſed viſitation remains; ſee the various circumſtances of your condition, and in what manner of meetneſs you are for the bleſſed inheritance of life eternal. May that glorious light which ſhines from heaven to the ends of the earth, and reaches to the moſt hidden ſtate and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of men, that light that never flatters nor ever will, that ſacred manifeſtation of the ſpirit of truth that leads into all truth, that ſpirit that is given through Jeſus Chriſt to the world; may that bleſſed eternal ſpirit of grace and truth ſhine forth in us, and diſcover to us, how matters ſtand betwixt God
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:037439_0052_100D43680FDC0730"/>
and our ſouls; for it is clearly evident to the view of my underſtanding, that all our opinions, all our hopes, will avail us nothing, till they are fixed and eſtabliſhed in the faith and hope that comes by Jeſus Chriſt. We can have no laſting peace till we ſubmit to the rules of the everlaſting goſpel, and are, through its virtue, brought into a holy confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the heavenly teacher. But this men cannot do of themſelves; for the light, that glorious and celeſtial light, is come into the world, yet men by nature, love darkneſs better than light. But, me-thinks, the proper effects of the light in the firſt fruits of creation, engages the firſt fruits of our capacities, to live and walk by it, with an enliven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing underſtanding; but ſome abide ſo much by the light, that they cannot make any progreſs in the things of God.</p>
            <p>All theſe great truths of eternal ſalvation can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver enter into their ſouls till they are brought to cry out with the apoſtle, "Oh wretched man that I am who ſhall deliver me from the wrath to come;" theſe can never take in the glorious exiſtence of the object of worſhip, until God, by his holy ſpirit, open their hearts, and unfold their dark underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; then, as the mind is affected by the humbling, melting operation of immortal kindneſs, it is brought to a true ſenſe of its ſtate, and humbled as the duſt: "Oh wretched man that I am, who ſhall
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:037439_0053_100D43699C168188"/>
deliver me from the wrath to come!" Thus the miſtaken multitudes of mankind, that ſay they ſhall ſit as a queen, and know no ſorrow, have an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on inſtead of faith; flattering expectations, inſtead of hope; and inſtead of that divine charity that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains forever, are ſetting themſelves in the warmth of ſelf-love, till at laſt they are brought to cry out, "Oh wretched man that I am!" Oh, that I had more knowledge of myſelf!—Look not upon me O, daughter of Jeruſalem!—the ſun hath looked upon me, upon the corruptions of my nature. I thought I had been comely, when I viewed myſelf, and was dignifying myſelf with the ſcanty garments of an outward profeſſion: but look not upon me. O daughter of Jeruſalem, for I am black; I now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold my deformity and diſagreeableneſs to unſpotted and infinite Purity. Oh! wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the dreadful wrath to come.</p>
            <p>This is the ſolemn language of all fleſh, when they are favoured to ſee themſelves in the light of their God; but there are ſome among you that have made to yourſelves images of faith, hope, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and ye worſhip the erection on the plains of Babel, and are falling down to worſhip theſe dead images of religion. In the plains of Babel, and in the land of confuſion, are the miſtaken multitude aſſembling together, to offer worſhip to the various
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:037439_0054_100D436D31744740"/>
images they have formed, and happy are thoſe who know the veil to be rent, and the holy ſpirit to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten their underſtandings, and that theſe images are broken to duſt by the breath and power of the eternal ſpirit of God.</p>
            <p>How often may we remark perſons making uſe of the forms and words of another's prayer, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the experience of another, that is quite foreign to their own, or, in their addreſſes to God, have been forming and faſhioning their worſhip in pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar manners that are not their own; and thus they are offering to the Lord of hoſts, a ſacrifice that hath not only coſt them nothing, but is, at the ſame time a "lye in their right hands." They can approach his holineſs and take his ſacred and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable name in vain, without difficulty. Theſe are ſuch things as I cannot be reconciled to; and, how often may we hear people expreſſing themſelves in language of ſcripture, accented to worſhip, in that which it has no manner of relation to. I have heard perſons that are vile ſay or ſing (as if they had a right to uſe the language of ſcripture) "rivers of tears run down my eyes becauſe men keep not thy law." I have heard perſons that are vile ſay, "I hate the workers of iniquity," when the glorious work of righteouſneſs is not the deſire of their hearts, but only the experience of another. When they approach the dread Majeſty, thus they mock
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:037439_0055_100D436F80526D90"/>
him, and thus diſcover the mark of miſtaken worſhip and the indubitable mark of the beaſt is in their foreheads. I have heard others ſay or ſing, as the "hunted hart panteth after the water brook, ſo panteth my ſoul after thee O God;" when it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than what ſuch impoſe upon God for worſhip, when, alas! there has been no manner of truth in it at the heart, nothing but an expreſſion which they have vainly taken into their mouths.</p>
            <p>Oh the abominable preſumption of men, that they ſhould thus ſtrive to deceive the all-ſeeing eye of the Dread of Nations, and appear before God with a lye in their right-hand. Oh! that man, whoſe breath is in his noſtrils, ſhould thus mock the Almighty ruler of heaven and earth! They are creating an image in the plain of Babel, and are falling down to worſhip it; they are worſhipping with their heads and their tongues, whilſt their hearts are far from him; they have ſpoken other men's words, and have been led on to idolatry till they are become a dead ſubſtance. True worſhip would clothe mankind with reverence, it would raiſe an awful petition for deliverance and ſalvation, were they convinced in themſelves, that the Lord beholds them, and that they are weighed in the balance of the ſanctuary and are found wanting; and when they have ſeen themſelves as in the viſion loſt; then they cry out, "Oh wretched man that I am!—Lord
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:037439_0056_100D43710F3AFCA0"/>
ſave me, I periſh!—ſend forth thy help, or I ſink! if I have not thy help, I am undone."</p>
            <p>If we are truly awakened we ſhall find arguments to addreſs the great Parent of mankind; and it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary we ſhould cry to him for help and preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If a child wants bread, it will cry to its parent for relief; and, in this ſimilitude, I mean to ſpread greater things before you by ſmaller ones, and to direct your ſolemn cries to the Univerſal Parent and Friend. I pay a peculiar regard to ſuch motives as may excite and awaken tender compaſſion in men towards themſelves: their conſciences ſhould be their own monitor, —that which would move them to call for relief—they that walk in the light are the ſons of light and of day—they have a language that enters the ears of the Lord of Sabbath,—in their fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cries they look towards the glorious habitations of his holineſs, with awful reverence; and the ſpreading of their cauſe before Chriſt is in the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatical language of the heart, and in a flow of tears do they pour forth their prayers at the throne of Sacred Wiſdom; and there is no true prayer ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to Chriſt as that which proceeds from the humble and awakened heart; if it is but a ſigh, an intelligible ſigh, it is ſufficient; it is more divine and acceptable to the everlaſting Father than all the words and expreſſions in the world.</p>

            <head>The following SERMON was delivered, on First<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day morning the 17th day of the Fifth month 1767, at the <hi>opening</hi> of the yearly-meeting, at the Fryers, in Bristol.</head>
            <p>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Sam. xx. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Art thou in health; my brother?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT hath been in my mind to adopt the language or ſalutation of Joab to Amaſa; but with ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments different, far different, from thoſe which actuated the treachery of Joab; even thoſe of true and tender affection, and with a mind repleniſhed with that charity, which wiſheth well to all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Art thou in health; my brother?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I could wiſh, with all poſſible ſolicitude, to lead every mind preſent, into the moſt careful enquiry, in reſpect to their ſpiritual ſtate of health; and to their immediate relation, and affinity, to that ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme almighty Being, who is the juſt and awful Judge of quick and dead. I fear it hath proceeded from too anxious a ſolicitude for the health of your bodies, and proſperity of your temporal concerns, that too many of you have too frequently, and in a
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:037439_0058_100D437646CDED98"/>
manner totally, neglected the great concern of your immortal ſouls; which is indeed <hi>the one thing need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe temporal concerns, I ſay, which are of a trifling periſhing nature, have, I fear! interrupted and taken off from this principal concern: your anxiety and application towards the attainment of the treaſures and the enjoyment of the pleaſures of the world, have occaſioned too great a neglect of your religious duty.</p>
            <p>The conveniencies of life are, by no means, a contemptible concern, where they are bounded with temperance, and confined within their proper chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel: but as there is a part in us of infinitely greater, of no leſs than eternal moment; it alſo requires an attention proportionable to it's proper worth; for what are temporal concerns when compared with the important one of eternity!</p>
            <p>The ſtate of the body is ſubject to divers mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; and when we have done our utmoſt to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, we ſhall find in the end (and how ſoon that may be none knows) that it is of neceſſity, ſubject to the ſtroke of death, and to the encloſure of the grave.</p>
            <p>I have therefore thought it by no means an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper enquiry for each individual to make, and
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:037439_0059_100D437A169FC750"/>
deeply ponder, What is thy ſtate, or how is it with thee, O my ſoul? who art capable of partaking of immortal joys! and deſigned, to triumph over death and the grave, <hi>When this earthly tabernacle shall be dissolved,</hi> thy appointment and deſtination, if in proper ſoundneſs for it, ſhall be made perfect with the whole family of GOD, and be no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſubject to the diſeaſes, pains, trials and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this life, but ſhare the things which are of GOD, <note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. xii. 23.</note> 
               <hi>With the general assembly and church of the first-born, whose names are written in heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As this is of the moſt infinite importance to the ſons of men, I have thought it my particular duty, upon the preſent occaſion, to put you in mind of the neceſſary enquiry into the ſtate of your ſpiritual health; the condition of your immortal ſouls: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very apprehenſive that all of you, my brethren, are not in perfect health, who have outwardly the appearance of health; but that, on the contrary, many are in a dangerous ſtate of diſeaſe and ſtupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; have only preſerved a lethargic frame, and are tottering upon the brink of deſtruction.</p>
            <p>This enquiry into the preſent ſtate of experience, and of advancement in the work of ſalvation, hath branched itſelf out in my view, and divided into
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:037439_0060_100D437C6499DF80"/>
ſeveral claſſes, thoſe who are now within the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of my voice. And in the firſt place, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat the attention of you, the elders, amongſt whom our LORD, as amongſt ſo many ſhepherds, hath divided his flock; over whom you are appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to watch, and to teach them to perſevere in the path which leadeth to eternal life?</p>
            <p>You have experienced the power of religion: you have <note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. xiii. 12.</note> 
               <hi>put on the armour of light;</hi> and ought to ſtand as guardian angels, and to call as the angel called, ſaying, <note n="‡" place="bottom">Rev. xxi. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Come up hither, and I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Are you in health,</hi> my brethren, <hi>Are you in health,</hi> my ſiſters?—<hi>Are you in health,</hi> my fellow labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the LORD? —Are you in a lively active ſtate in the cauſe of religion? in the cauſe of virtue and temperance? in the power of the goſpel, as it is in CHRIST?</p>
            <p>If thoſe that have been called with an high and holy calling, as delegated ſhepherds under the one great ſhepherd, walk uprightly in his fear and to his glory; then the ſheep will with them be more likely to be gained upon to follow the great Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd; they will then have a frequent deſire, a long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:037439_0061_100D437DF17E41F0"/>
appetite after the divine Manna, which cometh down from GOD out of Heaven: for every life hath its food and its proper nutriment; and a ſoul panting after heaven can be ſatisfied with nothing ſhort of the <hi>food</hi> from heaven.</p>
            <p>In the next place, I addreſs <hi>you,</hi> my brethren in the work of the miniſtry, reminding you of its divine inſtitution, all that have entered rightly into it <note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. v. 4.</note> 
               <hi>being called of God, as was Aaron.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is written, <note n="†" place="bottom">Pſalm civ. 4.</note> 
               <hi>he maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire;</hi> and tho' the term <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> be generally underſtood of the glorified ſpirits in heaven; yet, as it ſignifies <hi>messengers,</hi> it here ſeems to be applicable to thoſe whom the Moſt High prepares and ſends forth, to excite and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liven his militant church on earth.—<hi>Are you in health, my brethren?</hi>—It is the divine will that you be fed with celeſtial food; not with the unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things of the world nor with the unlawful love of its lawful things; but that you become <hi>as angels</hi> and <hi>like his ministering spirits,</hi> as a flame of fire. He will make you, if with due conſtancy ye adhere to, and attend on him, a ſacred and fixed flame of love, and of light never to be extinguiſhed: your care, and pains, and labour here will be but a moment, your reward will be <hi>a crown of life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting.</hi>
               <pb n="45" facs="unknown:037439_0062_100D437FF4DBB148"/>
The bread that you eat, and the water that you drink, and of which ye miniſter a due ſhare to others, will be daily ſpringing up in you unto everlaſting life! The divine Manna and the daily ſacrifice will be continued. Reſt in hope, —look for the coming of your LORD.—Labour in the diſcharge of your duty.</p>
            <p>Indeed it hath ſometimes happened that ſome of the miniſters of CHRIST, <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. iv. 1, 2.</note> 
               <hi>stewards of the mystery of God,</hi> have not been ſound faithful to what he required. Be ever mindful of the neceſſity of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on and wearing the ſpiritual robes, prefigured by thoſe of <hi>Aaron:</hi> the holy girdle about the loins; the breaſt-plate, with the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim;</hi> the <hi>Bell</hi> and the <hi>Pomegranate.</hi> Some indeed have had the <hi>Bell</hi> ſending forth an empty unavailing ſound, but have wanted the <hi>Pomegranate,</hi> the ſoul-enliven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fruit of the good ſpirit of CHRIST, our everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing high prieſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But I hope better things of you,</hi> beloved in CHRIST, <hi>and things that accompany salvation.</hi> I am ſure we have need, with the utmoſt diligence, application, and care, to keep the loins of our minds girded about: we had need to ſtand upon the watch: we have great need to maintain the utmoſt ſteadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:037439_0063_100D4381F4616898"/>
for if we, who ſtand in the fore front, ſhould fall, we fall not alone: if we ſlide from the path of truth, who amongſt us will be able to ſtand!</p>
            <p>We ought to be endued with the ſpirit of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, of judgment, and with ſound minds; which he hath promiſed to them that aſk this bleſſing from him, and hath made good his promiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Are you in health, my brethren?</hi> are you ſtrongly attached to the promotion and exhaltation of that glorious cauſe which you have embarked in? have each of you a ſhare in, and a proper care of the LORD'S work? Do you watch over the flock attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on your miniſtry, under the great Shepherd, and with the tenderneſs of goſpel love <hi>seeking to save that which was lost?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I freely confeſs my own ſears, that I am not in a ſtate of perfect health and ſound mind; labouring as I ought in the work of the LORD. As it is a taſk of the utmoſt importance, I ought to remain ever diffident of my own care, and to watch daily in the diſcharge of a truſt ſo great and important as that of the recovery and preſervation <hi>of the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The proſtration of the ſoul before the GOD and Father of mercies, in a cauſe of ſuch infinite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, is a continual duty, which can ſcarce ever be
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:037439_0064_100D438487182598"/>
ſufficiently diſcharged, the ſecret cry of my ſoul has, after this manner, frequently ariſen, "LORD! ſpare thy people and bleſs thine heritage." I am fully perſuaded, my friends, were all the miniſters and elders more bleſſed with ſound health, the minds of the flock would be more filled with bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly kindneſs, and more and more approach to that ſtate which I have mentioned; they would know what is meant by the <hi>angels being spirits,</hi> and how to underſtand his <hi>ministers being a flame of fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I come now to another claſs, whom I mean to addreſs under the title of thoſe within the audience of my voice, who continue in a ſingle ſtate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Are you in health my brethren and sisters?</hi> are you poſſeſt of inward virtue, and of ability to live to GOD, as becometh his ſaints; and which alone will lead you to eternal life: do you aſpire after theſe, with an unabated zeal?</p>
            <p>You muſt not expect always to reſt ſatisfied with the good things of this life. The day may come when you will loath the abundance of your tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral poſſeſſions: you will then be concerned that you have ſo indulgently <note n="*" place="bottom">Haggai. i. 4. &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>dwelt in ceiled houses, and
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:037439_0065_100D43861393D358"/>
have let the house of God lie waste.</hi> Then you would be glad to have exchanged the fading pleaſures of life for the ſubſtantial joys of eternity.</p>
            <p>Recollect yourſelves in the ſpring time of life; conſider early the importance of this exchange, while you have it in your power to make it. Look up to an object more glorious than the preſent world can afford you, even to the joys of that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal inheritance, which <hi>the children of the first-born, the innumerable company of happy spirits, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral assembly of just men already made perfect,</hi> are repleniſhed with.—Pleaſures unſpeakable! that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt for evermore!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Art thou in health, my brother?</hi>—my dear bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, are ye fervently engaged in labouring, for the promotion of the cauſe of GOD upon earth?</p>
            <p>O ye parents and heads of families, who are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced as delegated ſhepherds over them; timely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, left the blood of your children, or of any part of your charge fall on your heads: (if through your miſconduct they become corrupted, and their ſouls periſh.) Know that inquiſition for blood will haſten from the ſupreme Judge, who divideth the claſſes of mankind; and, as it were, ſeparated from the reſt thoſe who are parents, and have children:—his call is to theſe, "Go work in my vineyard."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="unknown:037439_0066_100D438869121190"/>Theſe precious gifts which he hath given, as pledges of his love, are to he led and inſtructed by them with a proper authority.</p>
            <p>If the parents experimentally felt the advantages of ſpiritual health in themſelves, then would they be concerned that the tender minds of their children ſhould be properly cultivated with the knowledge of the LORD, and a fearful apprehenſion of tranſgreſſing his ſupreme commands. They would teach them to look further than mere temporal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions; even to GOD their Creator. They would bring them up in the nurture and fear of the LORD; in order that their minds might be filled from the ſtore houſe and magazine of boundleſs good, and early enriched with the joys of GOD'S ſalvation: and <hi>this</hi> would naturally diffuſe the greateſt ſatisfaction to the parents them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to ſee their children become the delight and ornaments of human nature, and fitted for a glorious change! <hi>the company of angels, and the spirits of just men made perfect.</hi> The ties of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the ſtronger ties of gratitude to him who gave the bleſſing, call aloud for teaching the tender minds of your children, to walk in the ſafe and delightful paths of virtue.

thoſe tender ſheep which I committed to your care in the wilderneſs? have you trained them up in ſafety?</q> How will ſuch parents be ſupported by a conſciouſneſs of having done their duty, in that ſolemn hour!—They then may truly ſay, <q>I have done my utmoſt within my contracted ſphere, within the narrow precincts of my allotment in life, to fill up my ſtated duty.</q> Then the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Judge will ſet at his right hand ſuch pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and they ſhall be united to him in glory.</p>
            <p>And I beſeech you parents, elders, miniſters, (and I include myſelf) let us all ſay Amen, to this ſolemn care in our reſpective families; let us all diſcharge our ſeveral duties as men, hoping for the coming of our LORD; who will then ſay unto us, "Well done, good and faithful ſervants," even in that hour when he ſhall come with terrors to make inquiſition for blood thro' the various ranks, whether miniſters, elders, heads of families, even throughout the various claſſes of mankind.</p>
            <p>I wiſh all parents and heads of families would continually walk, hand in hand with their children and families, in the path which leadeth to life eternal; daily watching over, and improving their riſng judgments, with the wiſdom which cometh from above; inſtructing and encouraging them in the contemplation of divine things! perſuading

them to believe, as the truth is, that the things of this world are all uncertain, and fading away! that they have everlaſting manſions erected for them in the city of their GOD; where (if they fall not ſhort, or turn not aſide) they will enjoy the company of ſaints and angels for ever more.</p>

Alas! that the folly and vanity of the ſuperfluous pleaſures of the world ſhould ſo entirely engage and engroſs the attention of any one immortal individual, as to take up almoſt every moment of their precious time!</p>
            <p>Hence, ſometimes, parents, inſtead of inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the minds of their children, have ſo totally corrupted their own, that they have laid obſtructions in the way to the immortal happineſs of their off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, and, when their children have for a time trod in the ways of religion and virtue, they have been ſo extremely corrupt themſelves, as to oppoſe them in their paſſage; to obſtruct them, with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, in their way to glory; and thereby aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their own guilt beyond expreſſion; alas! what will their puniſhment prove, when convicted of ſo great a neglect and violation of their duty? when he that is Judge of quick and dead ſhall appear in judgment, to render to every man according to his works!

For as, on the one hand, minds infected and vitiated <hi>with the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, or the pride of life,</hi> are very apt to ſpread the contagion to all that are round about them: ſo, on the other hand, ſuch as are reſtored by Chriſt, to a ſtate of ſpiritual health, and by him ſteadily preſerved in it, often become inſtrumental in his hand, to diffuſe that bleſſing; from whence, healthy parents have been frequently obſerved to have healthy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
            <p>I am convinced that the Lord is at work amongſt the riſing generation; many of whom ſtand convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their own minds, of the want of ſpiritual health; and are imploring the mercy of the God of their ſalvation.</p>

            <p>It ſeems to me of the greateſt importance, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the various affairs of life, to form aright the minds of youth; and therefore, I once more entreat every parent preſent, that you watch over, and carefully nouriſh every ſeed of virtue ſpringing up in the minds of your children, for the ſake of their, and of your own, temporal welfare; as well as for the hope and aſſurance of both their, and your own, eternal happineſs.</p>

            <p>In this city he hath laid his hand upon one, and upon another.

            <p>A ſenſe of the want of that food which Chriſt gives, is at leaſt a ſymptom of life.</p>
            <p>I believe it may be ſaid concerning ſome among you, as was ſaid formerly to Chriſt; <hi>Lord, he whom thou lovest is sick.</hi> The decay of health in many, has been owing to foul feeding; to their daily feeding upon the ſpirit, maxims and manners of the world, upon exterior appearances, upon comparitive righteouſneſs, upon a compariſon of their preſent, with their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſtate; whoſe minds are relaxed with the love and ſpirit of vanity. Some have relaxed into evil, and are now become too much unacquainted with God and his law; which, to holineſs, and to that only, annexes happineſs. Many of theſe might have gone on from one degree of ſtrength to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; had they not too much regarded the things of time, and fed too greedily upon the temptations and pleaſures of this life; not enough conſidering, that the diſeaſes and diſorders of the mind thus fed, muſt certainly at laſt bring death, even the <hi>death,</hi> tho' not <hi>dissolution,</hi> of the ſoul.

a certain degree of ſtrength; and been more and more advanced on their way to the regions of bliſs.</p>
            <p>I beſeech you, continue in your love to the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Chriſt: that, day after day, you may feed on the holy ſacrifice, and on that eternal fruit with which he nouriſhes the ſoul that hungers and thirſts after righteouſneſs. And, I cannot help, while I am ſpeaking, preſſing you in a more immediate manner, if poſſible, that, not relying on your own wiſdom, and your own ſtrength, but in a full de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence and leaning upon the breaſt of the beloved Jeſus, you all, patiently, with a holy ſoundneſs, proceed in the highway to the city of God; that you may be crowned at laſt with glory, honour, and immortality!</p>
            <p>I find in me (at leaſt) one qualification of a goſpel miniſter: even that of a ſtrong and ardent love, which wiſheth well to all mankind: and in particular that you who are preſent, may enjoy ſuch a ſtate of perfect health, as I have been at this time enforcing to your ſerious conſideration: may it ſpread through every claſs; may you all encreaſe in the ſtability of righteouſneſs, through this life; and may it carry you into the boundleſs joys of eternity, into that glorious city, not one of whoſe inhabitants, can ſay, "I am ſick."</p>

            <p>HAVING in the morning enlarged on our debts or obligations to God, for the abundant variety of temporal bleſſings received from him in truſt, for the good of others, &amp;c, he proceeded thus:</p>
            <p>"If we are beſides ourſelves, it is unto God: If we are ſober, it is for your ſakes <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Cor. v. 13.</note>." If, with the ſtrength of love, and a zealous fervency of mind, we labour in and for the church, and for the good of thoſe to whom we are ſent; if riſing early and lying down late; if being willing to ſpend and to be ſpent, diſintereſtedly, without any lucrative motive,
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:037439_0075_100D439BE4751588"/>
or receiving any thing but mere food, from thoſe amongſt whom we labour; if miniſtring to our own wants, and to the wants of others, carry any kind of evidence to the conſiderate and prudent mind, of a diſintereſted goſpel miniſtry; we have, ſo far, a valid claim to it.</p>
            <p>"We preach not ourſelves, but Chriſt Jeſus the Lord; and ourſelves your ſervants, for his ſake <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Cor. iv. 5—</note>."</p>
            <p>"If we are beſides ourſelves, it is unto God, If we are ſober, it is for your ſakes. Having known the terrors of the Lord for ſin;" having experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a gradual progreſſion from the pit of pollution, from the mire and clay; "having," in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, "taſted of the good word of life, and of the powers of the world to come," we apprehend we have authority, more than any human laws or ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of men can give us, to tell to others, what God hath done for our ſouls. I may proceed yet further with truth and ſincerity, having the ſanction of him, who is the ſearcher of hearts; "for the love of Chriſt conſtraineth us <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Cor. v. 14.—</note>." The foundation of the goſpel miniſtry is this conſtraining love of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>We enter not into the miniſterial office, with any application of this ſort, viz. "Put me (I pray thee) into one of the prieſts offices, that I may eat a piece of bread <note n="‡" place="bottom">1 Sam. ii. 36.</note>." We think
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:037439_0076_100D439DF823A4A0"/>
higher of the goſpel miniſtry; ſo that no tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary emolument can poſſibly be an adequate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement to us, to enter upon it; for "the love of Chriſt conſtraineth us." We ſpeak with reverence and a feeling heart; and we believe the chriſtian religion will never flouriſh, in its full perfection and excellency, till their being thus conſtrained, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the caſe of all that take the name of God in their mouths in a public manner."The love of Chriſt conſtraineth us; becauſe we thus judge that if one died for all, then were all dead. And that he died for all, that they which live, ſhould not henceforth live to themſelves, but to him that died for them and roſe again <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Cor. v. 14.—</note>."</p>
            <p>This expreſſion ſeems to me, if properly conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to caſt no inconſiderable light upon the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of that query applied to us, viz. "How much oweſt thou unto my Lord?" which I cannot yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh; though ſome may think I dwell upon it too long. "The love of Chriſt conſtraineth us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if one died for all, then were all dead." I look upon this as a fundamental part of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an faith; "and that life and immortality" have been "brought to light by the goſpel." We were all dead; we have all partaken of guilt; we have all been in a ſtate of enſtrangement from the covenant of God; we have all become, more or leſs, "aliens to the commonwealth of Iſrael <note n="†" place="bottom">Eph. ii. 12.</note>."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="unknown:037439_0077_100D43A02D0E2630"/>In this ſtate of death, the voice of God hath been ſignally extended unto mankind. I have ſometimes conſidered with great attention, his declaration, "O! death, I will be thy plagues <note n="*" place="bottom">Hoſ. xiii. 14.—</note>;" and it hath made a deep impreſſion upon my mind. This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the moſt high God hath been amply ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in the experience of all who have been quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened into a life of piety. "Chriſt" hath been "the reſurrection and the life" to all ſuch. Though "death" hath "come upon all," we are not all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded under death; ſo as to be left without the quickening vivifying power that is offered to raiſe the dead to life.</p>
            <p>"The dead have heard the voice of the Son of God <note n="†" place="bottom">John v. 25.—</note>!" and have been raiſed again to life. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think but it has been the experience of divers, within the audience of my voice, who know the certainty of this important truth though others may reflect upon me, as being beſide myſelf; yet, if ſo, I may ſay with the apoſtle, "it is unto God." But I would gladly ſpeak intelligibly to the ſoul that is on its way to the regions of immortality; for, if we are ſober, "it is for your ſakes." I would aſk whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a ſecret ſomething hath not often viſited your ſouls, an unſpeakable ſomething, often ſecretly and immediately attended, that hath engaged you to ſend up heavenly and earneſt wiſhes, and raiſed in
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:037439_0078_100D43A2567680E8"/>
your minds ſtrong aſpirations, or breathings, after God? when we are told that "the whole creation groaneth together in bondage until now <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. viii. 21, 22.—</note>," we have no doubt of its being relative and applicable to the preſent times, or ſuch times of longing after God, to be delivered by him. "The Lord from heaven is the quickening ſpirit <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Cor. xv. 45 47.—</note>." An expreſſion of want, from a real ſenſe of it, is an evidence of life; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing raiſed by him from a ſtate of death. We have not been left in a dead ſtate! this prediction hath been verified, "O! death, I will be thy plagues," He hath brought the firſt evidence of life, which is a ſenſe of want. The ſpiritually dead have received it; and it hath been of his pure mercy, that he hath followed us from time to time, hath met us, as it were, in a narrow place, with inſtructions and reproofs, and ſecretly raiſed in us the hidden life of his own divine wiſdom; he hath cauſed the anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and warming beams of the ſun of righteouſneſs to break forth. And, yet more, the word which called Lazarus out of the grave, hath already, in a good degree, raiſed ſome of us to life, even life eternal? "death is ſwallowed up in victory <note n="‡" place="bottom">1 Cor. xv. 54.</note>"</p>
            <p>And therefore "the love of Chriſt conſtraineth us," becauſe he hath proved "the plagues of our death," He not only died, but the immediate ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:037439_0079_100D43A51543CD48"/>
of his quickening ſpirit hath led "capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity captive," that we, by him, may triumph over the united powers of darkneſs.</p>
            <p>We follow not formally; but we believe in, and are convinced, fully convinced, of the doctrines of the chriſtian religion, the incarnation, glory, life, death, mighty miracles, and various circumſtances relative to the holy life of Jeſus, "as in the volume of the book it is written <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſaiah liii. 7.—</note>;" and can, in an awful and reverent ſenſe, commemorate, thoſe vaſt and moſt intereſting events.</p>
            <p>We admire, with humble hearts and minds, the awful tranſactions of that time, when ſweat, like drops of blood, ran from the face of the holy Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus! when, being in agony, he prayed more earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly! when he was betrayed! his ſacred head crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with thorns! his, face ſpit upon! he was moſt ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominiouſly treated, and as "a ſheep before her ſhearers is dumb <note n="†" place="bottom">Pſalm xi. 7.</note>," he complained not.</p>
            <p>We behold him, in his agonies on Calvary Mount, offering himſelf as a ſacrifice for the ſins of the whole world; that he might purify us, by the ſhedding of his precious blood! "more precious than the blood of goats and lambs;" or any other that was ſhed under the law. We believe in his
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:037439_0080_100D43A74BCC7260"/>
amazing mercy, in offering himſelf there; when, loaden with the immenſe weight of the ſins of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and the immediate ſenſe of the Father's preſence withdrawn, he was left to ſuffer alone; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this extreme preſſure crying out, "Eloi, Eloi, lama Sabacthani!" was crucified! dead! and buried.</p>
            <p>Here pauſe a little, I beſeech you!—contemplate the adorable theme! acknowledge, O man! that unbounded gratitude which is ever due from thee: O! my ſoul, "how much oweſt thou unto thy Lord!"</p>
            <p>I know we have been ſtigmatized, as diſbelieving the truths of the chriſtian religion. However, I call the divine record, the Saviour of the world, that was offered a ſacrifice without the gate of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, to witneſs for my belief, that he was ſent from GOD, to do the "Father's will;" and I do, without controverſy, believe that he was "GOD manifeſt in the fleſh, juſtified in the ſpirit, believed on in the world, and received up into glory <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Tim. iii. 16.—</note>." We do not at all doubt that God was "in Chriſt recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling the world unto himſelf <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Cor, v. 10.</note>. That Chriſt gave
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:037439_0081_100D43A8D52E8FC8"/>
himſelf a ranſom for all, to be teſtified in due time <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Tim. ii. 6.—</note>; that with his ſtripes we are healed <note n="†" place="bottom">Iſaiah iii. 5.—</note>."</p>
            <p>By virtue of that holy ſacrifice the remiſſion of ſins is gained; the awakening power of that ſentence which is due to ſin, is felt in a ſtate of alienation from God; and as we believe, that if one "died for all, then were all dead," ſo we believe that he who was crucified, dead and buried, likewiſe tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed over the grave, and now "ſitteth at the right-hand of God," in a glorified body, to make interceſſion for man, in order that he might effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally purchaſe, and redeem to himſelf, a people to the praiſe of his name; and diffuſe, throughout his univerſal empire, a ſimilarity of opinion and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ariſing from the experience of his univerſal redeeming love.</p>
            <p>I am no Arian, far from it:—I believe in the clear emphatic teſtimonies laid down in holy writ, that Chriſt was more than a prophet. I repeat my belief, that he ſuffered, died, aſcended, and is now come "the ſecond time, without ſin, to ſalvation <note n="‡" place="bottom">Heb. ix: 28.</note>," in order to reconcile the world to himſelf. I know many are willing to admit that he died for all, as all were in a ſtate of death: and that, by the imputation of his righteouſneſs, all are juſtified in the ſight of God. Whereas I think it more juſt to proceed in
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:037439_0082_100D43AB9DC41248"/>
the language of the holy inſpired apoſtle; that "they which live, ſhould not henceforth live to themſelves; but to him who died for them and roſe again;" that there may be an effectual redemption, a thorough change; not the imputation of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, without works; but a real ſubſtantial righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in the heart and life; which may operate upon, and regulate the mind and will, and lead us to a conformity to his divine nature: not a righteouſneſs imputed to us from what Chriſt did and ſuffered without us; but a righteouſneſs raiſed by him with in us, through our ſurrendering ourſelves to his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and yielding entire ſubmiſſion to his heart-cleanſing, refining power.</p>
            <p>However this doctrine may reliſh with ſome, I am convinced he died for all, that all ſhould be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; that, through him, we might be juſtified in the ſight of God; that we might put on "the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, with all his divine affections."</p>
            <p>"The whole creation of God groaneth toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. viii. 22.—</note>, to be cloathed upon with a houſe from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Cor. v. 22</note>;" not an imaginary houſe, and an imaginary righteouſneſs; but to be cloathed upon with the grace of complete ſalvation; to put on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; having firſt put off the old man, with all his works, and with all his corrupt wiſdom, or
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:037439_0083_100D43AE4A654528"/>
knowledge; which puffeth up, inſtead of that charity which edifieth.</p>
            <p>"Chriſt is made unto us Wiſdom, Righteouſneſe Sanctification, and Redemption.</p>
            <p>In remembering therefore that he died for us, let us conſider what follows; "that henceforth we ſhould not live to ourſelves. I am crucified with Chriſt <note n="*" place="bottom">Gal. ii. 20—</note>," ſays one of the apoſtles, as a private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and it ſhould, and ought to be, the language in truth of each individual, through all ſucceeding ages. "Nevertheleſs, I live; yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me." He is become my righteouſneſs; not by imputation only—but he actually liveth in me; and the life which I now live, is by the faith of the Son of God. I think I may now ſay, "Let us preſs forward toward the mark of the prize of the high calling of God <note n="†" place="bottom">Phil. iii. 14.</note>." Let us be crucified with Chriſt, "crucified to the world, and the world to us."</p>
            <p>O! my friends, for ſuch I term you in the courſe of that univerſal love which reacheth forth to the whole human race, which floweth from him who hath thus wrought for me, and "brought life and immortality to light" in my ſoul. Is any one of you deſirous of being informed, "how much oweſt
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:037439_0084_100D43B04B056940"/>
thou unto my Lord?"—lay hold on his offers of redemption, live in his fear, in fellowſhip with him, "in communion with the church of the firſt born, whoſe names are written in heaven; ſo will you far better know than any one on earth can inform you."</p>
            <p>Examine the riſing ſuggeſtions of your own minds; you are not formed to live merely to your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, merely within the contracted bounds of human privileges, in the narrow limits of mortality. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the dignity of your nature; you are formed for the moſt glorious purpoſes.</p>
            <p>I earneſtly wiſh the riſing youth would lay theſe things ſeriouſly to heart, and often meditate upon them, as one formerly did, who thus expreſſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, "While I was muſing the fire burned. My heart was hot within me; then ſpake I with my tongue, Lord, make me to know my end, and the meaſure of my days, what it is, that I may know how frail I am <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſlm xxxix. 3, 4.</note>."— That they would contemplate the great deſign of Providence, with regard to their immortality, which would leſſen their eſteem of the unſubſtantial joys of time, and engage them to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue thoſe which are "unſpeakable and full of glory" for ever. "While I was muſing the fire burned."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="unknown:037439_0085_100D43B1D38EB2D8"/>Continue this muſing, this ſtate of meditation: prize the invitations of the ſpirit of Chriſt, merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully extended to your immortal ſpirits: and let your minds mount upwards: remember your pious predeceſſors, now perhaps in glory; and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions in the world of ſpirits: likewiſe put this queſtion to yourſelves upon every ſerious occaſion, "How much oweſt thou unto my Lord?"</p>
            <p>I am fully convinced, were the chriſtian world in general to leave out exterior ceremonies, and enter more into this inward meditation, their minds would be more largely repleniſhed with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine fruits; and thoſe who are entering as it were upon the wilderneſs of this world, would then par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the advantage. O! that we might all live in the beauty of holineſs?</p>
            <p>"My heart was hot within me: then ſpake I with my tongue."—A neceſſary preparation for a preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er! Abel's offering, on account of ſuch a prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was "more acceptable to God than his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's."</p>
            <p>"Then ſpake I with my tongue."—O! riſing generation, what you ſpeak with your tongues, let it be from the ſame good ſource of hearts divinely prepared; ſince, on the other hand, for every "idle word" that men ſpeak, they muſt "give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in the day of judgment." As you often ſpeak
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:037439_0086_100D43B35D03C7B8"/>
with your tongues, fervently deſire that the ſacred faculties of the mind may be fitted for divine medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and the tongue to publiſh for the honour of God and benefit of others, what you have been taught by him; ſo will you never admit or utter any thing contrary to the divinity of Chriſt Jeſus your Lord.</p>
            <p>"Lord, let me know mine end!" O that this ſound may dwell upon your minds, who are the hope of the next generation! upon whom the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty truſt and care of the cauſe of God, muſt, in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time neceſſarily devolve; that you may come to the knowledge of the "meaſure of your days." I think, without violence to the text, you may learn from it that you are deſtined for immortality: but the love of worldly things is too apt to engage the attention of that immortal part, the ſoul; which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, to many, the want of their knowing the great and glorious end for which they were formed, "a little lower than the angels," and intended to be crowned "with glory and honour."</p>
            <p>"Lord! let me know my end, and the meaſure of my days!"</p>
            <p>I tremble, methinks, upon the brink of eternity! and ſo, with a little proper reflection, you might ſay all, the aged, the middle aged, and the youth,—
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:037439_0087_100D43B6D26F7798"/>
"the end of all things is at hand:" flatter not your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves therefore with length of days, and a long proſperity of worldly poſſeſſion, ſuffer me to beſeech you, for the ſake of your immortal ſouls.</p>
            <p>"What do I owe to my God?—What do I not owe him?"—He hath ſnatched me as a brand out of the fire: and I would not, though to gain the world, tread back again in the path of folly.</p>
            <p>I know it by experience, and therefore I would perſuade you, not to turn aſide from the God of your ſalvation; but to acknowledge the infinite debt you owe him, and to pay him daily with obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, adoration, and praiſe.</p>
            <p>Our ſins have been great, and our tranſgreſſions <hi>never</hi> could have been obliterated, had not Chriſt done it for us; let us therefore no longer dwell upon the rock of Preſumption with Satan. who hath been a lyar from the beginning; but let us ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſcend into the valley of Humility and Peace, and ſettle accounts with the God of our lives, from whom I had ſtrayed to that degree that my life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a burden to me, and I have wiſhed that I had never been born; but Chriſt, who was "a friend to the publicans and ſinners," is now become "the rock of my ſalvation!" he hath cauſed me to truſt in him, and to ſeek the Lord my God. The debt I
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:037439_0088_100D43B90FB7AA98"/>
owe is infinite, I deſire ever to acknowledge it with all poſſible gratitude; and to do my utmoſt towards the diſcharge of it, while I have my being.</p>
            <p>If there is a ſoul within the audience of my voice, which (upon this awful query) "How much oweſt thou unto my Lord?" is ready to apprehend, that it owes too much ever to hope for a diſcharge, or freedom from the heavy load of debt it has contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; I have a little to ſay to ſuch, even from my own experience: thy tranſgreſſions do not exceed the bounds of his mercy; he ſtill careth for thee, with an inexpreſſible fatherly care and tenderneſs. Even when his afflictions are upon thee, they are intended for thy good. "The bruiſed reed he will not break, the ſmoaking flax he will not quench." The more any of you ſee your real ſtate, the more you remember the favours you have received, and feel the burden of your injuſtice and ingratitude, the more readily will he meet the penitent diſpoſition of your minds.</p>
            <p>I have no manner of doubt but he, "whoſe work is ſalvation," who "came into the world" purely and purpoſely "to ſave ſinners," will carry on his own work, and, as you wholly reſign your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to his forming hand, will purify your hearts, reconcile you to the Father, and make you ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting inſtances and monuments of his infinite
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:037439_0089_100D43BA9AEAF5F0"/>
mercy. Lift up therefore thy head in hope, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou art, in this humbled penitent ſtate; for "thy ſalvation draws nigh," Thou oweſt abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance to thy Lord: and there is an abundance which thou canſt never pay: but there is the good Samaritan, ever ready to do for thee, as for him, who going from Jeruſalem to Jericho, "fell among robbers;" by whom he was wounded; "and" to ſay, "take care of him, and I will pay." There is a glorious ſound from the great and good "friend of publicans and ſinners;" he is ready to ſay to thee who art in this penitent ſtate before him, "Take thy bill and write down fifty." He will "blot out thy ſins as a cloud, and thy tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions as a thick cloud <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſaiah xliv, 22.</note>."</p>
            <p>I cannot but remember with renewed feeling, and warm emotion of heart, the day that anxiety (in the view of my condition) ſeized me; and how his mercy relieved me from it. He made my ſoul feel his compaſſion, and in the depths of gratitude thankfully to adore him. And hence I often feel a tenderneſs of mind towards thoſe who are weary of vanity, and heavy laden with a ſenſe of their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold tranſgreſſions. I beſeech ſuch, by the mercy of GOD, that they would fly to him in their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of mind; for it is he, and he alone that can ſpeak peace to the ſinner; tho' your unright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couſneſs
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:037439_0090_100D43BC2577DBA0"/>
may be great, it is not in any degree of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to his infinite mercy! Again, ſuch among you to whom I have ſpoke, who delight to dwell in the path of temptation, wherein you have too long continued; I warn you to conſider, that you are in the road to deſtruction.</p>
            <p>I would not give up, like Eſau, "my birth-right" to ſeek "a place of repentance with tears, and not find it <note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. 12.16, 17.—</note>." O my ſoul! for ever acknowledge how much thou oweſt unto thy Lord! Let none ſay "he hath bleſſed me variouſly, and in ſome future time I will awake my ſoul to gratitude, I have now ſomething elſe to do;" like him who, when an apoſtle "reaſoned of righteouſneſs, temperance and judgment to come," replied, "Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient ſeaſon I will call for thee <note n="†" place="bottom">Acts xxiv. 25.</note>."</p>
            <p>The like diſpoſition continues to prevail in too many; and this ſeems to be the language of their hearts, "Go thy way this time; call upon me when I have lived to myſelf, and anſwered my own pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes a little longer: viſit me at ſome diſtant time hence." Oh! rather "to-day, while it is called to-day.—Harden not thy heart:" do not defer thy repentance a moment; thou knoweſt not what <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

moment may produce." Conſider thy repeated tranſgreſſions; thy multiplied offences againſt God: heap not up "wrath againſt the day of wrath:" ſwell not the direful account. Thou haſt hitherto trampled upon the goodneſs and the mercies of the God that made thee; venture not on preſumption and delay. Time is uncertain: Immortality is at hand.</p>
            <p>I beſeech you therefore, my friends, at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time, that you will lay to heart the neceſſity of your making up this great account; delay it not to the decline of life. Many are on the brink of the grave! reflect upon your extreme danger! think not of crouding the account of your repentance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your laſt hour of life! you will find it extremely difficult to labour under the infirmities of the body upon a death-bed, without a reaſonable ground of hope: all the offers of mercy having been long continued, and often repeated; yet by you as long and as often rejected; what then will diſcharge you from that dreadful account! I wiſh it may never be the caſe of any within the audience of my, voice. Let us all immediately ponder, rightly conſider, and ſeriouſly improve this conſideration, "How much oweſt thou unto my Lord?"</p>

            <p>Thou haſt loved us before we loved Thee; thy love, O Lord! hath not been after the manner of men: Thou haſt called us, when we were enemies; and haſt reconciled tranſgreſſors to thyſelf.

            <head>THE FOLLOWING DISCOURSE WAS DELIVERED ON THE 22d DAY OF THE FIFTH MONTH, 1767, AT THE FRIERS, IN BRISTOL.</head>
            <p>I HAVE frequently thought, and the ſentiment hath been confirmed from my own obſervation and experience, that a great and excellent point would be gained, highly conducive to the advantage of mankind, did they generally, though from no ſurer guide than tradition, ſubſcribe with heart and mind to that certain truth recorded in holy writ:</p>
            <p>"Verily there is a reward for the righteous: Verily he is a God, that judgeth in the earth <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſalam lviii.<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>.</note>;"</p>
            <p>As ſuch a perſuaſion, from whatever grounds it ariſes, naturally tends to influence the conduct to
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:037439_0099_100D43CB945B45F0"/>
avoid evil, and to purſue that which is good; and with regard to many, it hath proved a ſtep to their nearer acquaintance with God, who is the only ſure guide to true happineſs.</p>
            <p>Indeed I ſcarce think there can be many, if there be any, who are hardy enough to deny the exiſtence of a ſupreme Being; but believe on the contrary, that many, through the divine favour, enlightened to ſee their duty, and aſſiſted to diſcharge it; do, in conſequence of theſe favours, contemplate, with ſatisfaction inexpreſſible, theſe attributes of the moſt high God, here mentioned by the pſalmiſt; and could I be induced to think, that any part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind had ſwerved from their duty for want of a firm conviction of thoſe his attributes, as relative to his creatures; and of the certainty that there is really "a God who judgeth the earth:" I ſay, could I believe their minds were deſtitute of this animating and enlivening proſpect of his power, omniſcience, and goodneſs, in his ſuperintendant care, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent judging the earth, I ſhould deem ſuch but a very little removed, if any, from the ſtate of the Athenians, upon whoſe altar the holy apoſtle diſcovered an inſcription,
"To the unknown God <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts xvii. 23.</note>."
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:037439_0100_100D43CDAFB85AB8"/>
Indeed a language that was ſpoken formerly hath been too much adopted by ſucceeding generations; numbers of whom have been like thoſe men of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, who ſaid, "the Lord will not do good, neither will he do evil <note n="*" place="bottom">Zeph. i. 12.</note>." Many (ſeduced by the grand deceiver and his agents) have endeavoured to eſtrange and withdraw themſelves from the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrator of the whole earth: they have hence grown dark in their imaginations, and in like manner thus reaſoned with themſelves, "He will do us no good, why therefore ſhould we ſeek him?—he will do us no harm; why ſhould we fear him?" This we may juſtly look upon, as the moſt unhappy ſeduction of mind! as it miſleads to the utmoſt diſtance, (without timely recovery) from that ſtate of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in which we are only capable of happineſs, through the favourable notice of our Father who is in heaven.</p>
            <p>But we may juſtly conclude, that ſuch impiety paſt not the attention of an all-ſeing God, in as much as he replied, "I will puniſh thoſe men of Jeruſalem, who have ſaid, The Lord doeth us no good, why ſhould we ſeek him? he will not do us any harm, why ſould we fear him!"</p>
            <p>The certainty of his ſuperintendency, hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to be the happineſs of all the wiſe and good
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:037439_0101_100D43CFEE7372F0"/>
in all ages; and it is theſe, and only theſe, that diſcern wherein true happineſs conſiſts. Hence hath it become, and ſtill remains, an eſtabliſhed glorious truth, accompanied with, and confirmed by, the voice of all generations.</p>
            <p>Under this head in particular, a petition or prayer that was put up to Him who hath created the earth, and aſſigned a reward to the righteous, by Agur the ſon of Jaketh, hath appeared to my mind, as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary at this day to be adopted by every individual who is deſirous of living to the beſt, wiſeſt and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt purpoſe of life; without which we had better never have lived: and I cannot but recommend it moſt particularly to You, the riſing generation, whoſe minds I truſt are at times ſuſceptable of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per impreſſions, who are not become ſlaves to the vanity and luſts of the world: and indeed it ſeems like the language of one that is entering upon the ſtage of life: "Two things have I required of thee, deny me them not before I die!

               <pb n="85" facs="unknown:037439_0102_100D43D2E28FC740"/>The ſubſtance of this memorable requiſition hath appeared to my mind, during the courſe of a long ſeries of obſervations of men and times; with regard to its import in point of religion, virtue, the love and peace of God; as including indeed all that is good and neceſſary for our ſafe conduct and ſupport through this life, to that completion of happineſs propoſed as the final reward of the righteous.</p>
            <p>But how will ſome be able to prefer a petition to a power in whom, alas! they have no truſt? who would gladly be poſſeſt of, and are much better pleaſed with, ſharing a crown of wicked proſperity in this world, than with a proſpect of a crown of pure and perfect felicity, in a ſtate of endleſs fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity.</p>
            <p>O that parents would timely and vigilently exert themſelves to raiſe early impreſſions in the tender minds of their children, in order to fix deeply the chriſtian doctrine, with all its glorious conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; firmly perſuading and convincing them, that they are under the immediate notice of that Being, who is ever unſpeakably good and gracious; and informing them that he is cloathed with every awful reverential attribute; as being perfectly wiſe, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful and good, yet ſtrictly juſt; that he is the Maker of us all; and that he delights to be called
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:037439_0103_100D43D46DB25958"/>
upon by us, with the tender and endearing appellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of, "Our Father, who art in heaven."</p>
            <p>Wherefore, under the deep and reverent ſenſe of the certainty of his continual preſence and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, let us be ever careful, ever earneſtly deſirous to conſtitute a part of his children and family, in this our probationary ſtate; that as we, by our rank in the creation, belong to the order of ſpirits; we may aſſuredly hope to join the cherubim and ſeraphim, in the habitations of glory and peace, by our now becoming members of his militant church; and may, when our warfare ſhall be accompliſhed, unite with the chorus of his triumphant hoſts, in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and tribute of grateful adoration and praiſe.</p>
            <p>And indeed without this bleſſed hope, we are of all creatures, the moſt miſerable! being daily ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with lamentation and woe! combating with ſecret or obvious diſtreſſes! and encountering, from the cradle to the grave, a perpetual ſucceſſion and variety of afflictions! We might therefore tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, if our hopes were only fixed upon the tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and fleeting pleaſures of this life, we ſhould be of all the animal creation, the moſt miſerable! But we are aſſured that nothing leſs than GOD himſelf, is the infinite and endleſs reward of all that diligently and conſtantly ſolicit him to the following purpoſe, —"Two things have I required of thee, deny me

them not before I die; remove far from me vanity, and lies; give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me, leſt I be full, and deny thee, and ſay, who is the Lord? or leſt I be poor, and ſteal, and take the name of my God in vain!"</p>
            <p>Which is as if the Prophet had ſaid, <q>Thou art my Father, the Author of my being; I made no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing myſelf, but am wholly and entirely the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of thy power and workmanſhip of thy hands: thou knoweſt therefore what is beſt and fitteſt for me; and what can I require elſe from the hands of thee, O my GOD! than thy preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion out of the dangers of thoſe oppoſite extremes in life; thy guidance in the middle path of ſafety and innocence, and the enjoyment of thy appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation and favour in my walking therein!</q>
            </p>
            <p>His mind was doubtleſs deeply impreſſed with the awfulneſs and eſſential ſubject of his petition; and "the removing far from him vanity and lies" ſeems to conſtitute a very conſiderable part of it. But too many of us deviating from this one moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant point, are daily inclined to wander in the broad path of vanity and folly, and prone to miſtake it for the path of peace; 'till oftentimes the ſtroke of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, of pain of body, or affliction of mind, convinceth in part, and, if unreformed, that of death may fully convince us, when too late! of this moſt fatal miſtake.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="unknown:037439_0105_100D43D9E8515D88"/>The Prophet ſaw into the propriety of that frame of mind, which utters the language dictated by divine wiſdom: "Truſt in the Lord with all thine heart, and lean not to thine own underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note n="*" place="bottom">Prov. iii. 4.</note>:" inaſmuch as his gracious ſuperintendency and merciful notice of his creatures is ſuch as even "taketh in the ends of the earth <note n="†" place="bottom">Iſai. xlv. 22.</note>;" and daily afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us the cleareſt manifeſtation of his goodneſs here, as it hath evidently pointed out to us that glorious path which leads to ſafety and eternal peace. But vanities and lies have too frequently e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtranged the mind, drawn it off from heavenly objects and heavenly cares, and fixed its attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon things wholly unworthy the notice of an immortal ſpirit. Under the ſeducing influence of "vanities and lies," men have been frequently led to purſue many things agreeable to their own wiſhes and imagined intereſts, without the leaſt regard paid to juſtice and equity.</p>
            <p>I may poſſibly obſerve an explanation and diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the two ſtates as I go on, which Agur ſeems to refer to, viz. "The diſtreſs and miſery of the poor," on the one hand; and the "vanity and pride of heart," too frequently conſpicuous in the rich, on the other.</p>
            <p>Were the lives of men deſigned to be wholly alienated from a ſtate of juſtice and virtue, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely

inſtructed and fixed in the maxims and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of this world, ſingly to be taught to conſider it as the chief end of their exiſtence, there would then be ſome excuſe for uſing every ſpecies of art in joining "houſe to houſe, and laying field to field, till there be no place, that they may be ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as it were alone in the midſt of the earth <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſa. v. 8.</note>;" but now, as the great deſign of him who judgeth the earth, and rewardeth the righteous, hath been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly manifeſted and denounced to ſuch as thus counteract it, they who are intruſted with riches will appear the more inexcuſable for their abounded avarice, and can have nothing to plead in favour of their violation of his plain and clear intentions reſpecting mankind. It will all at laſt be ſound "vanity and lies," without virtue; without a faithful dedication of their hearts to the revealed will of GOD. It is an obſervation of the preacher that "God giveth to man that is good in his ſight, wiſdom and knowledge, and joy—but to the ſinner he giveth travail; to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God <note n="†" place="bottom">Eccleſ. ii. 26.</note>." And though he who is too unmindful of his Creator, may have erected edifices that appear to the eye of the ſpectator as if they would ſtand for ages, and may "call them by his own name;" yet even in this view, without virtue, he is, in the ſenſe of Agur, a lyar to himſelf: he thinks he hath ſecured
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:037439_0107_100D43DDA224C8A0"/>
happineſs, when the frame of his mind is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe of it; fixt probably in a ſtate of excluſion, from what may be juſtly deemed true and ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial happineſs; or any acquiſition, which will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable and well-pleaſing in the ſight of GOD. In this circumſtance therefore he is a lyar. The by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtander indeed, who ſees him in the free enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of affluence, and taking his eaſe, in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, in the fulneſs of his heart, may be ready to conclude ſuch an one happy, by being unacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with his ſecret griefs; whereas many of his moments, if their true ſtate could be penetrated into, would appear like thoſe diſtreſſed ones of the king of Iſrael; who when he was ſeated in the height of his ſplendor, magnificence, and royalty, "rent his clothes; put on ſackcloth, faſted, and lay in ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth, and went ſoftly <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Kings xxi. 27.</note>."</p>
            <p>Labour therefore after righteouſneſs, rather than to "lay up for yourſelves treaſures upon earth; where moth and ruſt doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and ſteal <note n="†" place="bottom">Mat. vi. 19, 20.</note>;" that by ſuch timely and prudent application ye may lay up for yourſelves "treaſures in Heaven; where neither moth nor ruſt doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through and ſteal."</p>

To what purpoſe was I created?</q> dedicate your moments to the real purpoſes of life, pay not too great a regard to any proſpects or tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this world; fix not your attention upon its maxims and propoſed intereſts, which, when they become our idols, do but deceive and deprive us of infinitely greater; beware of being ſeduced by the out-goings of your own minds: let not things that are tranſient and periſhing gain too great a poſſeſſion of your hearts and affections; nor ever neglect the following intereſting petition, "Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move far from me vanity and lies:" and remember that he is the guide, helper, and director of all them that put their truſt in him.</p>
            <p>"Give me neither poverty nor riches." I readily conclude that in the firſt part of this petition all would willingly join; but riches are moſt apt to lay hold of our hearts and affections; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny indeed are the promiſes to the poor, "Whom the Lord will deliver when he crieth, even him that hath no helper <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. lxxii. 12.</note>;" they are frequently encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to hope; while the rich, if they miſ-apply the riches committed to their truſt, we are aſſured by

divine authority, will be conſtrained "to weep and howl:" they enjoy the bleſſing and bounty of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which they ought to apply to the nobleſt purpoſes, particularly the relief of their diſtreſſed brethren, "in as much as ye have done it unto one of the leaſt of theſe my brethren," (ſaith our Saviour) "ye have done it unto me <note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. xxv. 40</note>." For which purpoſe he hath communicated to ſome a larger ſhare of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral enjoyments; which ought to be a ſtriking mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, a neceſſary incitement to well-doing: but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las! inſtead of it, too frequently wealth becomes ſubſervient to the purpoſes of pride, luxury, and wickedneſs: and therefore our LORD remarks in another place, "how hard it is for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of Heaven <note n="†" place="bottom">Mat. xix. 23. 24.</note>." And the apoſtle James ſays, "Go to now ye rich men, weep and howl, for your miſeries that ſhall come upon you; your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth eaten; your gold and ſilver is cankered, and the ruſt of them ſhall be a witneſs againſt you; the hire of the labourers which have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth; the cries of them which have reaped, have entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth <note n="‡" place="bottom">James v. 1, 2, 3.</note>."</p>
            <p>If the extent of thy ſtewardſhip, O Man! is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, thy obligations to thy Maſter are ſtill great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; if thou haſt received additional bleſſings from

the GOD of bounty, it is a truſt which calleth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee to diſtribute with an unſparing hand. O then, ye who are thus favoured; maintain a ſteady endeavour to diſcharge your duty in the ſight of your Creator; deceive not yourſelves with a belief that happineſs conſiſteth in the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of your poſſeſſions, ſince they bring with them their dangers as well as obligations to duty, but like fountains of water which ſupply the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſtreams, "be ready to diſtribute, willing to communicate <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Tim. vi. 18, 19.</note>," this being the way to lay up in ſtore for yourſelves a "good foundation againſt the time to come; that ye may lay hold on eternal life."</p>
            <p>I have known ſome men, and even women, who have thought the ground ſcarce worthy to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the preſſure of their feet, diveſted of all the ties and tenderneſs of humanity, and wholly puft up with "vanity and lies;" but as the reign of ſuch is ſhort, and not even then without its pains, and "their end miſerable," as in many parts of the ſacred re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords we are aſſured; may there be none ſuch here preſent; on the contrary, let it be a part of your conſtant care, not only to feel the diſtreſſes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but to viſit, and be convinced, and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſhare the neceſſities of the poor and needy; to ſoften the anguiſh of their afflicted minds, to alleviate their hidden griefs, and to dry up the

            <p>Some that are preſent, may think this unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able doctrine, and be ready to reply, <q>I have a family to provide for, and therefore I muſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace every opportunity of acquiring, and laying up all my acquiſitions in ſtore for them: and ſhould I neglect the preſent, the like may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver happen again in the courſe of my life.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Such or the like arguments are often too rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily taken up, and obſtinately urged, in oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the moſt important concern; to the unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able prejudice of themſelves, of the diſpoſitions and morals of their children in particular, and of human ſociety in general: how quick is the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of many from a ſtate of health to the grave! "Thou fool! this night ſhall thy ſoul be required of thee <note n="†" place="bottom">Luke xii. 20.</note>!" was formerly pronounced to one of this kind by the great Judge of all men.

Conſider then it may be thy caſe; and art thou prepared againſt thy dying hour, to render him ſuch an account, as will then ſupport thee, and juſtify thee in thy claim to the inheritance of his everlaſting kingdom, by thy having faithfully ſought it, and attended to the conditions thereof, preferably to all the deareſt objects of this uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and momentary ſtate of exiſtence?</p>
            <p>I am fully of opinion, many who run after the world with open mouth, and that mouth ſcarce ever cloſed, until death cloſes it; could they be induced to yield ſome of their precious moments to timely and ſerious reflection; would endeavour to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw themſelves from tranſitory things at leaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their laſt moments of life; and in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, prepare (after this manner) to meet their GOD.</p>
            <p>They would now and then retire, for a ſhort ſpace at leaſt, from the world, before they entirely left it; frequently ſit down, and ſeriouſly turn their view towards another world, another ſtate of being into which they can never hope to carry wealth, or honours; toward that approaching dread tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of righteouſneſs, where theſe will gain no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
            <p>When we take a ſurvey of the world, and look back thro' the generations that are paſt, we ſee
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:037439_0113_100D43ECAEAE0320"/>
that the love of vanity, wealth, and grandeur, hath proved from time to time the ruin even of the faireſt empires and monarchies, which have been ever erected on the face of the earth: one reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on after another, and one ſtate after another have been deſtroyed, from the pride and diſſipation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in the minds of governors and teachers.</p>
            <p>How ought this conſideration to humble the hearts, and redouble the vigilance of ſuch as are placed in exalted ſtations!</p>
            <p>I hope and truſt our love as a people hath not been confined peculiarly to ourſelves; but extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as it ought to be, to all our fellow creatures; to relieve poverty and diſtreſs, according to our abilities; to prevent and reclaim from the infinite dangers and harms of impiety, and to encourage every kind of real virtue.</p>
            <p>Though ſome families may have turned aſide in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſtate of the world, and become engroſſed with the love of its pleaſures and enjoyments; yet many others, I hope, and believe, have denied themſelves; have "laid hold of the good word of life;" and under its influence, purſued "the one thing needful." Tho' ſome have declined, and even refuſed, the ſubjection due to their Maker, as if they had aſked with inſolence, <q>Who is this LORD, that he ſhould reign over our hearts?</q>
               <pb n="97" facs="unknown:037439_0114_100D43EEF47542A0"/>
and had added, <q>We know no power equal to that of getting wealth, and honours;</q>—yet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have not departed from the obligations of fear and love; but have made proper reflections, paid juſt reſpect to the great Author of their being; and manifeſted it by a ſteady watchfulneſs in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, which I moſt earneſtly deſire may become the happy caſe of every one of my fellow creatures.</p>
            <p>The preſent ſolemn occaſion is an important leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of inſtruction to us all! The departure of the diſembodied ſoul, from this world, to another; which methinks ſhould entirely prevent our ſetting too great a value upon all temporal poſſeſſions.</p>
            <p>I have ſometimes been preſent in a dying hour; I have been preſent at a ſcene of humbling diſtreſs; I have ſeen in ſome, the cloſing period of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular life of virtue: yet ſuch a life, as on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of outward poverty, had been deſpiſed and over looked—a whole life ſpent, in which its hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt moments would have paſt for miſerable, in the minds of thouſands: yet when they have finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their courſe, they have experienced trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant joy, in the bleſſed hope and aſſurance of eternal life! through the merits of their dear Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</p>
            <p>I have alſo beheld, on the other hand, the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of ſplendor exhibit a mournful ſcene of
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:037439_0115_100D43F084524708"/>
diſtreſs, far different from the former! then, when the ſolemn approach of death hath begun to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, attended with all its tremblings and fearful apprehenſions of an after ſtate! when the ſoul, agonizing in its pains, hath viewed things in a far different light to what it had before done, when even the riches, in which it had long truſted, fell ſhort of giving the leaſt ſatisfaction: no hope of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture happineſs afforded to the poſſeſſor! but, on the contrary, a gloomy proſpect of deſpair; of an eternal ſtate of miſery! of this I have been made a ſorrowful witneſs, that ſome have gone out of the world, "without God, without hope <note n="*" place="bottom">Eph. ii. 12.</note>;" without one comfortable reflection from the ſacred ranſom of a dying Saviour!</p>
            <p>In vain have they ardently wiſhed, in an expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring hour, that they might have been permitted to lengthen out their allotment of life, a little lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; that they might have but a ſhort ſpace of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded time afforded them, for the important pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of repentance, and amendment of life; for "feeding the hungry, cloathing the naked, and viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſick;" virtues, to which they had no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, in any of their paſt hours, and which then it proved too late for them to attain, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever neceſſary, for their ſtanding approved at the laſt judgment, to which they were approaching.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="99" facs="unknown:037439_0116_100D2F3DB6B73F78"/>May we all therefore learn inſtruction, from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples like theſe; and derive ſuch advantage from this preſent ſolemnity; ſeeking and embracing "the good word of life;" and ever ſtedfaſtly adhering to it, ſo long as we continue in mutability.</p>
            <p>May we never withdraw ourſelves, from watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful attention, to the guidance of divine Providence; never indulge ourſelves in arrogance, or truſt too much to the rectitude of our own hearts: but "pray without ceaſing <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Theſſ. v. 17.</note>," that we may be enabled to "do works meet for repentance <note n="†" place="bottom">Mat. iii. 8</note>;" and thereby attain an eternal inheritance in the kingdom of GOD.</p>

As I am fully ſatisfied it is not and will not be ſufficient for me, though I ſhould ſtand ever ſo eminently high, on the account of riches, or honours, in the eſteem or applauſe of men; "Remove, therefore, far from me vanity and lies; giving me neither poverty nor riches; but feed me," I pray thee, "with food convenient for me, leſt I be full, and deny thee, and ſay, Who is the Lord? or leſt I be poor and ſteal, and take the name of my God in vain."</p>

            <p>It is an uſual ſaying, "That ſhort reckonings make long friends:" continue this ſhort and frequent reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning; ever eſteeming "the numbering of your days aright," to be the moſt neceſſary and bleſſed exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe; that hereby ye may be in a continual readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for your final removal, how ſudden ſoever it may be permitted.</p>

            <p>IT is unto Thee, the Author of all our mercies, thou moſt glorious and holy One! that we preſume to have recourſe; and with the deepeſt humility and reſignation of mind, to acknowledge thy preſent bleſſings, and the diffuſion of thy wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and goodneſs, with gratitude, reverence and feeling ſubmiſſion! As thou beſt knoweſt what is beſt for us, we beg that we may be continually fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with thy providential and fatherly diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations; and with that mercy which ſanctifies them, which renders them moſt highly inſtructive and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to us: that hence we may enjoy inward peace in the time of outward trouble: we beſeech Thee thus to carry on and complete our ſanctification and ſalvation, that in thy appointed time, we may attain "an endleſs inheritance with the ſaints in light <note n="*" place="bottom">Col. i. 12.</note>."</p>

            <p>Eſtabliſh us, we pray Thee, upon the holy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable foundation of thy ever bleſſed and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable truth; Thou that haſt been with us, and remembered us; and haſt opened our hearts for thy admiſſion, through the virtue of thy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly power and divine love.

O moſt gracious Being! Thou that "workeſt in us to will and to do, according to thy good pleaſure <note n="‡" place="bottom">Phil. ii. 13.</note>," we pray Thee, bring all to thy temple; and enable them acceptably to worſhip Thee therein.

            <head>THE FOLLOWING DISCOURSE WAS DELIVERED AT THE QUARTERLY MEETING AT FRENCH-HAY, NEAR BRISTOL, THE 26TH OF THE FIFTH MONTH, 1767, IN THE MORNING,</head>
            <head type="sub">A GARDEN INCLOSED IS MY SISTER, MY SPOUSE, A SPRING SHUT UP, A FOUNTAIN SEALED <note n="*" place="bottom">Cant. iv. 12.—</note>.</head>
            <p>THE whole Book of Canticles is underſtood and taken in the way of ſimilitude, or meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor, ſetting forth that cloſe connection, that near and dear relation, which eternally ſubſiſts between CHRIST and his church; and in this ſenſe it cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly conveys inſtruction, very profitable as well as very delightful, to that mind which hath dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted itſelf to the love and obedience of him, its on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rightful LORD.</p>
            <p>The Church is called " a fountain of Gardens <note n="†" place="bottom">iv. 15.</note>;" which ſeems to me very evidently to imply that incloſed collected ſtrength, beauty, regularity; thoſe conſolatory refreſhments; that ſteady firmneſs of thought, unity of heart, and divine affection, which becomes a people that well underſtand what is meant by the ſolemn injunction of "girding up
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:037439_0125_100D4407E4996A50"/>
the loins of their minds <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Pet. i. 13.—</note>:" well appriſed of the ſtate of their pilgrimage; of the nature, end, and deſign of their being; of the neceſſity of "watchfulneſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to prayer <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Pet. iv. 7.</note>; of having their minds brought into, and eſtabliſhed in, the lovely order of the goſpel; "their loins girded;" their faculties circumſcribed, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the proper purpoſe, the great and glorious end of their being; within the limits of that holy frame of mind, which hath "a fountain of gifts," preparatory to every kind of uſeful ſervice, for the comfort of individuals, and the united benefit of the whole body; ever abiding in the "fear of the Lord," which "is the beginning of wiſdom <note n="‡" place="bottom">Prov. i. 7.9.10.</note>;" the moſt perfect wiſdom, by which the mind is kept clean, and preſerved in its proper cloathing.</p>
            <p>For "the fear of the Lord," as the Pſalmiſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes it, "is clean and endureth forever <note n="§" place="bottom">Pſal. xix. 9.</note>:" and if this fear continues to reſt upon our minds, it will aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly keep them clean; and more and more illuminate them to diſcern the propriety and fitneſs of this lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of CHRIST to his church: "a garden encloſed is my ſiſter, my ſpouſe, my church;" erected and preſerved by "my power," my followers united to me, and all dear to one another, "a royal prieſthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people zealous of good works <note n="‖" place="bottom">1 Pet. ii. 9.</note>."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="unknown:037439_0126_100D44097125A658"/>May we therefore all ſeparately, each for our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, attend to this ſtate, and become acquainted with that degree of reſemblance of ſuch an incloſed garden which we bear, in the ſight of him, who at one view, ſees the ſeveral conditions of men, and beholds the ſtate of his whole creation!</p>
            <p>If we are incloſed, of what nature is our inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? ſince nothing leſs will become our ſufficient defence, than the ſurrounding arm of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty! He is the ſtrength of every individual that rightly truſts in him: Their ſituation is aptly deſcribed in "holy writ," in many parts of it, by a variety of lively and beautiful figures; as here, by that of "a garden incloſed, or a fountain of gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens <note n="*" place="bottom">Cant. iv. 15.</note>." They likewiſe joyfully experience, in this ſenſe of the text, what was meant by the ſong that was predicted to be ſung in the land of Judah, when the divine covenant ſhould happily cement, and incloſe that favoured people in a ſtate of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, integrity and love, enjoying together the laſting and unutterable ſweets of divine protection and peace. "In that day ſhall this ſong be ſung in the land of Judah; we have a ſtrong city; ſalvation will God appoint for walls and bulwarks <note n="†" place="bottom">Iſaiah. xxvi. 1.</note>:" and I cannot but entreat that all preſent, who are come to years of mature conſideration eſpecially, may obey the call of GOD; come out of a ſtate of ſin, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect

of duty, and become "fellow citizens with the ſaints <note n="*" place="bottom">Eph. ii. 19.</note>" of this city; a city that hath "ſure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations <note n="†" place="bottom">Heb. xi. 10.</note>;" being built upon "that rock" which "the gates of hell <note n="‡" place="bottom">Mat. xvi. 18.</note>" have never been able to "prevail againſt."</p>
            <p>O you that are in the bloom of life, and ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the impetuous waves of divers paſſions; who continue yet uncorrected, unrefined by divine grace; may you diligently and ſeriouſly reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your extreme want of reſemblance to "the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den incloſed;" and of anſwering thereby the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deſign of your Maker concerning you! May you be directed "by the ſtill ſmall voice <note n="‖" place="bottom">1 Kings xix. 12.</note>," which the LORD GOD will make uſe of, and meet you with "in the garden <note n="(*)" place="bottom">Gen. iii. 8.</note>;" in order to reclaim you, and to draw you to himſelf! May all that ſtand in ſlippery places, make him their refuge, that they may know him, to calm every tumult in the mind; to crown them with the joys of obedience; and to direct their ſteps aright thro' life, to his honour, and their own true and laſting happineſs!</p>
            <p>May all who mourn for want of a place of reſt, attain this happy ſituation, all who are ready to cry out as one formerly did, "Woe is me that I ſojourn in Meſhech, and dwell in the tents of Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar <note n="(†)" place="bottom">Pſalm cxx. 5.</note>!" Woe is me for this ſtate of wickedneſs,
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:037439_0128_100D440D5FB0C330"/>
with which I am now on every ſide ſurrounded; both that of my own, and that of others round about me, who are ready to fear "the harveſt is paſt, the ſummer is ended <note n="*" place="bottom">Jer. viii. 20.</note>:" and that they are not gathered into the city walled with ſalvation: or the garden incloſed with divine beauty, with uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and unfading joy.</p>
            <p>I hope better things for thoſe whoſe concern ſometimes appears likely to become more than they are able to bear, even a concern, left they ſhould be excluded from an inheritance with the ſanctified.</p>
            <p>He that of old made "the mountains ſkip like rams, and the little hills like lambs <note n="†" place="bottom">Pſalm cxiv. 4.</note>," for the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous preſervation of his people, even when they had begun to deſpair of their deliverance; can ſtill equally effect the like glorious work in reſtoring the deſponding, the broken in heart; that, having been too much off their watch, have from thence been the more ſubject to be "toſt about by every wind of doctrine <note n="‡" place="bottom">Eph. iv. 12.</note>," and cunning craftineſs of men; whereby they lie in wait to deceive. Know that though your own reſolutions, your own ſtrength, and wiſdom, have been inſufficient (in the days that are paſt) for your ſecurity; and perhaps the ſtrongeſt reſolutions, that you have hitherto
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:037439_0129_100D4411AAB9C650"/>
made, have been written in duſt; ſo that the next gale of temptation hath blown them away; and you have hence been carried further and further, into a ſtate of groaning captivity, and crying diſtreſs! and have been unable to lift up your heads in the day of trial: know, that the duly humble and repenting ſinner hath ever been graciouſly received; and the diffident have become cloathed with divine ſtrength, through the name and power of the LORD JESUS; their minds have been brought into a holy frame, having entered within the celeſtial incloſure and defence.</p>
            <p>"O that the ſalvation of Iſrael would come out of Sion, then ſhould Jacob rejoice, and Iſrael ſhould be right glad." This hath been the ſacred language of individuals that have at times been toſt in uncertainty, diſtreſſed in vanity, wickedneſs and diſappointment; who, notwithſtanding, have been at laſt happily fixed within the habitation of "the holy city, or garden incloſed;" through a ſteady perſeverance and ſtrong reſiſtance, though in the night ſeaſon; like Jacob, who as a prince "pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with GOD and with men <note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. xxxii. 28.</note>." So the ſincere, the penitent ſinner, in his reſolute and patient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, imploring and relying on divine help, will at length obtain an aſſured victory, to his great joy,
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:037439_0130_100D4413A677C740"/>
and returning of thankſgiving to the Author of all his mercies.</p>
            <p>"A garden incloſed is my ſiſter, my ſpouſe;" ah, too unthinking youth! how widely different from this ſtate is too many of yours? To you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears particularly applicable that ancient call from GOD, "Keep ſilence before me, oh ye iſlands <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſaiah xli. 1.</note>!" I beſeech you, in this your time of danger, when, your minds may be compared to floating iſlands, blown upon and covered with a ſucceſſion of waves, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with temptations of various kinds, that are perpetually withdrawing you from that moſt preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous intereſt, which CHRIST hath purchaſed for you in "the garden incloſed;" I beſeech you, that you maintain a ſteady dependance upon him; that ye be vigilant in your purſuit after eternal enjoyments; that ye ſtand upon your guard againſt the wiles of the grand enemy to your ſalvation; remembering that even "when the ſons of GOD have met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, Satan hath preſented himſelf amongſt them <note n="†" place="bottom">Job i. 6.</note>."</p>
            <p>Doth thy mind watch with holy diligence to prayer? being fervent in ſpirit, that though the enemy may endeavour to come in as a flood of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and ſeek inceſſantly to draw thee from
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:037439_0131_100D441531C05400"/>
the ſtrong hold of that city, "whoſe walls are ſalvation, and whoſe gates are praiſe <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſaiah lx. 18.</note>;" the arm of Omnipotence may defend thee: know, thou art no farther guilty than as thou joineſt with the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it is no ſin to be tempted; the holy everlaſting Bridegroom of the true church, was himſelf tried, proved, tempted before thee, time after time, by "the ruler of the darkneſs of this world, the prince of the power of the air;" yet he continued unmoved, unwearied; being ſupported and ſuſtained by the power of GOD: "He was like unto us in all things, ſin only excepted <note n="†" place="bottom">Heb. iv. 15.</note>;" he knows and is willing to ſuſtain them that are tempted; and to encourage in the day of battle, every one that cleaveth unto, and calleth upon him, with full purpoſe of heart, in the whole courſe and conduct of his life; though he may be deeply proved, and may ſometimes be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to cry out.—"Even though the gates of death, may appear to be in motion againſt me, and juſt opening to receive me, yet if I die, Oh let it be at thy feet."</p>
            <p>This hath been the language of minds, in the day of temptation; and when the battle hath been hot, they have known a ſecret hiding place, where the enemy could not prevail. Though he encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the whole army of martyrs; though they were
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:037439_0132_100D441739098830"/>
tempted, trod upon, buffeted and even crucified; yet it never was in his power to ſubdue them; they were ſtill ſuccoured by the hand of the Almighty; they were enabled to "fight the good fight of faith <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Tim. vi. 12.—</note>;" to paſs through all their fiery trials with patience; and, in honour of their victory, are now "crowned with glory!"</p>
            <p>How beautiful, how amiable, muſt be "thoſe gardens incloſed," the riſing youth, in the vigour and prime of life! when their minds are circumſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and animated to piety; when they have upon them the indubitable proofs of the handy work of God; ſtanding immovably upright on the ſide of religion and virtue; keeping out all the works of darkneſs, by walls of divine erection!</p>
            <p>How excellent are theſe gardens incloſed! their converſation and behaviour, how edifying! how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary! how truly honourable! their admiſſion is ſure into "that glorious houſe, not made with hands <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Cor. v. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</note>," to a perpetual feſtival, an eternal fruition of the unſpeakably rich rewards of their good works, which they have been enabled to perform, to the glorifying of their father who is in heaven.</p>
            <p>Than ſuch a bleſſed ſociety as this, I know of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that can poſſibly be deemed more amiable upon the face of the earth; nothing more conſiſtent with
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:037439_0133_100D441A11955BA8"/>
the deſign of heaven; or more reſembling, for thoſe that are young "to remember their creator in the days of their youth <note n="*" place="bottom">Eccleſ. xii. 1.</note>," with a continual reverence; and to give up their hearts to him, in the perfection of love; for the moſt deſirable part of the whole cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation to live thus, amidſt the bloom and luſtre of the ſpring-time of life, is to conſtitute the "beauty of holineſs!" the one great ornament of "the garden of the Lord" here on earth!</p>
            <p>Ye heads of families, fathers, mothers, and guardians, that preſide over and ſuſtain the various relations in domeſtic life; ever carefully proſecute your own eternal happineſs, and the happineſs of all thoſe over whom you are placed in charge! exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in tender affection, and encouraging them by worthy example, to "ſet their affections on things above <note n="†" place="bottom">Col. iii. 2.</note>;" watchfully guarding, and even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining them, in order to preſerve them from all harms and corruptions of vice, "as gardens inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed" within the limits of that holy fear, "which is a fountain of life, that preſerves from the ſnares of death <note n="‡" place="bottom">Prov. xiii. 14</note>," and prepares for a crown of glory, in the regions of eternal felicity!</p>
            <p>When the ties of nature become joined with the ties of grace, and together reſt upon the minds of parents and guardians, they cannot but be ſolicitous that their offsprings and charge may be favoured, in
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:037439_0134_100D441C0748B730"/>
an eminent degree, with divine preſervation; they would then earneſtly deſire to help them forward in their way, being qualified to ſay to the riſing gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, "Follow me as I follow Chriſt." I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded had this been more generally the caſe, had they themſelves, I ſay, really lived "as gardens incloſed" within the bounds of divine wiſdom and government, our chriſtian ſociety would have worn a different aſpect to what it now does. Could parents and heads of families, from time to time have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed to the Searcher of Hearts, for the uprightneſs of their intentions, and the rectitude of their conduct in theſe moſt important concerns, then might they have ſaid with holy confidence, "Lord! now letteſt thou thy ſervant depart in peace; for mine eyes have ſeen thy ſalvation <note n="*" place="bottom">Luke ii. 29. 30.</note>!"</p>
            <p>What think ye, parents? ye that live as it were in a ſtate of ſtupefaction; what think ye of the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant moment, when in the ſight of God, angels, and men, inquiſition for blood ſhall be made? What think ye of the preparation of rendering the account with joy at the dread tribunal of final judgment? in which an inquiry into the diſcharge of your ſeveral duties, in this reſpect, will moſt aſſuredly be made? It is poſſible, and indeed I cannot but believe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the goodneſs of the Supreme Being, that, where the natural parents have been negligent in the diſcharge of this important truſt, and have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:037439_0135_100D441DA66237B8"/>
their offspring into bye-ways and crooked paths, forgetful of the way that leadeth to life eternal, the everlaſting Father hath not been wholly unmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of his children, thus abandoned to the wiles of the deſtroyer; but hath frequently reached forth a kind hand to ſuch, and will continue to make up to them, who gratefully receive his kindneſs, and obey his voice, the deficiency of ſuch paſt paternal care; even by the virtue of his living power in their hearts: in the mean time, the very criminal neglect of ſuch parents will, notwithſtanding this, draw down on them its own weight of condemnation: "the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing on the wall" will ſtill remain againſt them, and, like wicked Belſhazzar, they will be "weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the balance, and found wanting <note n="*" place="bottom">Dan. v. 5. 27.</note>."</p>
            <p>Indeed it muſt be confeſt, and I am thoroughly aſſured that all parents are not thus negligent: I cannot but remember the ineſtimable father I had in early life; and, above all things, his almoſt unexam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled care and tenderneſs over his infant offspring. I well remember the very powerful and moving elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of deſcending tears! when he collected his numerous family of little ones about him, and in the time of our extreme tenderneſs, and very early years, how often he hath wept over us, when he hath been recommending us to the throne of grace! though I cannot repeat the immediate language he
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:037439_0136_100D441F69E9FB00"/>
uttered upon theſe occaſions, which were ſo extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intereſting to us all!</p>
            <p>I wandered, as to myſelf indeed I may ſay, and ſtrayed from the "garden incloſed," in many of the ſucceeding ſteps of my life; and even now ſtand "as a monument of mercy amongſt you!" whilſt I thus afreſh remember and recite this amazing inſtance of a tender parent's anxious and unabated care, for our preſervation out of the evils that abound in the world; for our having a ſafe place within the inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, where Chriſt "feedeth his flock, and maketh them to reſt at noon <note n="*" place="bottom">Gant. i. 7.</note>!"</p>
            <p>O fathers and mothers! I beſeech you, by the mercies of God, and the ſolemn account you muſt one day cloſe with him, that you lay this charge ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to heart; ſtill offering up your humble petitions to the "Father of light," that he will enable you, more and more, to inſtruct the children he hath bleſſed you with, in the "one thing needful;" in order that being thus favoured, thus enlightened and enlarged by his power, you may have nothing to do but die, when that time ſhall arrive; nothing to charge yourſelves with, in relation to the neglect of this great duty, when the meaſure of your days ſhall be accompliſhed; but may render up your accounts "with joy," and receive the beatific ſentence of "Well done good and faithful ſervant; thou

            <p>"A garden incloſed is my ſiſter my ſpouſe."— May we pay all due honour to the teſtimony of Chriſt reſpecting his Church, both as individuals, as heads of families, and parents of children; and more and more ſuſtain, with diligence and proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in all our ſeveral ſtations, the character of gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens incloſed; or be as "plants therein, of the Lord's own right-hand planting;" plentifully adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and enriched with all the good fruits of his own ſpirit, that we may be as our fathers were in the day when the Lord raiſed them up, fed, and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly ſupported them! and may fervently pray, "that Sion might ariſe and ſhine, and ſhake herſelf from the duſt of the earth; and put on her beautiful garments <note n="†" place="bottom">Iſaiah. lii. 1, 2.—lx. 1.</note>!" and that many amongſt us, who yet need it, might ſhake themſelves from thoſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things that adorn them, as they vainly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine; that "that divine beauty and luſtre," which once conſpicuouſly ſhined upon and adorned our Sion, may again be reſtored, and continue to dwell amongſt us: and, in order to this, may we ſtudy more and more the increaſe of righteouſneſs and true holineſs; encouraging one another by good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and by tender counſel in the purſuit thereof; as we cannot, conſiſtent with our love of God, be

indifferent in our wiſhes for the happineſs and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of any of our fellow creatures, nor ſay of our brother, "Let him alone, leave him to himſelf, it is ſufficient for me to mind myſelf." Since it is our immediate duty to watch over him, and to be ready, on every occaſion, tenderly to adviſe and aſſiſt, to prevent or ſupport him; and not anſwer the Lord, when he ſhall require an account of his welfare from me,—"Am I my brother's keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. ii. 6.</note>?"</p>
            <p>At this door, my friends, unſpeakable damage hath entered, and widely ſpread amongſt us as a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; even through this neglect, the grand deceiver hath the more eaſily broke into this and the other family; the power of ſeduction hath taken place; and many young people may be ſaid to have laid violent hands on their own ſouls, and thoſe of others too, in their gradual ſtepping out of the "garden incloſed."</p>
            <p>"Am I my brother's keeper? What have I to do with the welfare of another?" This hath greatly obſtructed the increaſe of our felicity, as a collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive body; the progreſs of our Sion; and introduced the deſtroyer; who hath broke into our incloſure, and made a ſorrowful devaſtation among the flock and family of God. Where I ſee thus the danger of the hedge (which the Lord in mercy made about

What more have we to aſk, but that thou may ever continue to guide and direct us! that ſuch a ſenſe of thy unmerited mercies may be to us, as often heretofore it hath been, an enlivening com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and a ſtrong ſupport in the day of trouble: and we beſeech thee O bleſſed father! to remember all in the like ſituation: ſend forth 'thy light and thy truth', even amongſt thoſe who have never known or have long forgotten thee.

            <head>THE FOLLOWING DISCOURSE WAS DELIVERED AT HORSLEYDOWN MEETING, 1768.</head>
            <p>THERE is a paſſage in ſacred writ, which has been revived in my rememberance during the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of this meeting, and the train of reflections which it excited, has ſealed inſtruction to my mind, and furniſhed me with renewed cauſe of humiliation and gratitude;</p>
            <p>"Men and Brethren, what ſhall we do to be ſaved <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts ii. 37.—</note>?"</p>
            <p>Every perſon who ſeriouſly believes in the exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a God, in a future ſtate, and in the awful doctrine of rewards and puniſhments, cannot be indifferent reſpecting what may be his lot, when he ſhall be diſpoſſeſſed of this frail tabernacle of clay which he now inhabits, and which is approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the period of its diſſolution; it cannot be a matter of indifference to him, whether he ſhall finally receive the irrevocable ſentence of "go ye curſed into the regions of irremediable miſery <note n="†" place="bottom">Mat. xxv. 41.</note>;"
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:037439_0149_100D4439805B6E40"/>
or "come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for the righteous, enter thou in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the joy of thy Lord, and into thy Maſter's reſt <note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. xxv. 34.</note>." This concern has prompted many to enquire what is eſſentially neceſſary for them to believe and practice in order to render them the proper objects of divine complacence, and furniſh them with a well-ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hope of a glorious and happy immortality. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the honeſt and ſincere of every Nation under Heaven, have formed different ideas of the requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites to ſalvation, and of courſe have purſued as different meaſures to accompliſh that deſirable end. It is not my preſent buſineſs, to particularize any of thoſe various ſyſtems of Faith, which are adopted by any party amongſt mankind; it is not to contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert matters, in which ſincere men of the various denominations moſt ſurely believe; but rather to recommend them always to ſtand open to convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a ſtrict attention to thoſe rules of conduct, which appear to them moſt agreeable to the will of Heaven. I ſhall therefore addreſs myſelf to thoſe, in whatever religious ſociety they are found, whoſe honeſt enquiries have not yet been attended with ſufficient conviction, or led them clearly to perceive what are the terms on which their future happineſs depends, and who are therefore looking one upon another, whilſt this important queſtion is found, at leaſt in their hearts if not in their mouths, "Men and Brethren, what ſhall we do to be ſaved?"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="133" facs="unknown:037439_0150_100D443CE31D0380"/>I ſhall not preſume arrogantly to dictate to any, reſpecting matters of ſo important a concern as that of the ſalvation of the ſoul; every man ſhould exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe thoſe talents with which the Father of lights has endued him, in a cloſe and ſincere attention to the voice of the internal Teacher, and in the diſcovery of thoſe truths both practical and ſpeculative which have an immediate relation to the happineſs of a Being circumſtanced as he is. I ſhall ſimply pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe thoſe things which from my own experience as an individual appear to me worthy of God for their author, and worthy of man's moſt ſerious attention. It is an indiſputable truth that we made not our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: "We are thine offspring, thou haſt made us and not we ourſelves," ſays the prophet in his appeal to God. The matter which forms the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, the vehicles which the ſoul informs, and the intellectual powers and faculties we poſſeſs, derived their being from the eternal fountain of all power and intelligence, whom we characterize by the aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful names of Jah, Jehovah and God. It is alſo clear to me that we were brought into exiſtence with the benevolent deſign of finally ſuſtaining the confluent dignities of Glory, Honour, Immortality and eternal Life; the Lord Almighty hath in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable mercy promiſed, that after we have endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a ſeaſon of probation on earth, a conflict with our paſſions excited by numerous cauſes, and a fight of afflictions, we ſhould finally receive a glorious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:037439_0151_100D443EE0EFF608"/>
a perpetuity of unmixed felicity in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known regions of eternity. But this deſirable and excellent end is not to be effected by what is gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called fate, the laws of neceſſity, or the arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry will and power of the Author of our exiſtence. God has conſtituted us free and intelligent beings, and endued us with faculties capable of apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and practiſing thoſe duties which he makes the condition of our final acceptance with him: he offers, but does not impoſe happineſs on his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; he ſhews us the ſpiritual Canaan, he gives us power to poſſeſs it, but does not compel us to enter into it; good and evil are clearly ſet before us, but our election is not conſtrained to either; the Sovereign of the univerſe is no reſpector of perſons, for of one blood he made all nations that dwell on the face of the earth; they ſtand in the ſame relation to the univerſal Father, Shepherd and Biſhop of Souls, who tenderly invites the whole race of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to inherit the joy of his ſalvation. To this doctrine the holy apoſtle bore an ample and explicit teſtimony: "Of a truth, ſaid he, I perceive that God is no reſpector of perſons, but in every nation thoſe who fear him and work righteouſneſs ſhall be accepted of him <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts x. 34, 35.—</note>."—"If ye live after the fleſh ye ſhall die, but if through the ſpirit ye mortify the deeds of the body, ye ſhall live <note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. viii. 13.</note>." This is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that relates to every individual in the vaſt community of mankind, however circumſtanced,
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:037439_0152_100D44406AEA01F8"/>
whether bond or free, or in whatever climate he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides.</p>
            <p>All this indeed may be acknowledged both by thoſe within and without the audience of my voice, who are yet in doubt what they ſhall do to be ſaved with an everlaſting ſalvation; they want to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the preciſe ideas that ſhould be affixed to the conditions contained in the text, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they readily apprehend the terms life and death imply future happineſs and miſery. I ſhall the refore attempt according to the ability I am en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with, to give you my thoughts on the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſubject in queſtion at this time. To "live after the fleſh," is to live in the gratification of our animal appetites and paſſions, beyond the bounds of reaſon temperence and ſobriety, which as it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently introduces numerous diſorders into the animal ſyſtem, and aggravates the infirmities to which theſe corruptable bodies are incident, ſo it affects the good of ſociety, and renders unfit for thoſe contemplations and that felicity which is adapted to the dignity of rational and immortal ſpirits, beings whom God in his wiſdom "has made a little (and perhaps but a little) lower than the angels <note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. ii. 7.</note>," and who would crown them with a ſuperior glory, honour and happineſs to that which animal gratifications can confer on their deluded voteries. Whilſt we are in the body we muſt
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:037439_0153_100D4441F903B400"/>
expect to find thoſe appetites, affections and paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which belong to our nature; but theſe are to be reſtricted within the bounds of virtue, and attended to in proportion to our exigencies and neceſſities, of which the divine principle which God has graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly implanted in our hearts ought to determine.</p>
            <p>This principle of intelligence, although called by a variety of names in the different profeſſions amongſt men, is the ſame in nature throughout all mankind. It is the ſpirit in man that giveth a right underſtanding; it is the light that more or leſs enlightens every man; it is the word of God in the heart; the word of faith which the apoſtle preached to the gentiles; it is the grace that hath appeared to all men, teaching them to deny ungodlineſs and the world's luſts, and to live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in this preſent world; and finally it is the ſupreme reaſon, the law of truth and rectitude, the teſt of virtue and vice, which God himſelf hath erected in the hearts of all men; and happy are thoſe who hear and obey it in all things.</p>
            <p>I would not be underſtood to mean that this principle of which I am ſpeaking is deſigned to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct us in all truths which the human mind may attempt to inveſtigate, or to give a clear inſight into thoſe numerous ſpeculative ſubjects, which have, not only unprofitably employed mankind and

diverted their attention from more ſubſtantial ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, but which have perplexed and divided them from generation to generation; but by the exerciſe of it we may apprehend thoſe truths that belong to us, and have an eſſential relation to the important end of our exiſtence; of which truths the Father of ſpirits has enabled us to judge; this is implied by the queſtion which our Lord himſelf propoſed to a people miſled by the traditions of their fathers, and who had taken for doctrine the commandments of men, "yea and why judge ye not for yourſelves, what is right <note n="*" place="bottom">Luke xii. 57.</note>?"</p>
            <p>Various are our obligations and duties, religious, relative and ſocial, ariſing from our various connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, natural and divine: the relation we ſtand in to the Author of our being is that of children; filial fear, obedience and worſhip is therefore our indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſible duty to him, in our conduct at all times, throughout our whole lives. The relation which our fellow creatures ſtand in to us, is that of bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, children of the ſame univerſal Father, and formed for the ſame glorious and happy end; juſtice, charity and brotherly kindneſs are therefore our indiſpenſible obligations unto mankind. There are alſo various accidental relations, ſuch as father, governor, maſter, ſervant and numerous others, all which have their correſpondent duties. Thus far perhaps the perſons whom I immediately addreſs
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:037439_0155_100D4446C7E59F28"/>
at this time may concur with me in ſentiment, but they, as well as I, are perhaps conſcious of having failed in numerous inſtances of diſcharging their religious duties to God and their ſocial duties to mankind. We have all ſinned and fallen ſhort of the glory of God; we have multiplied our tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions without number! and our iniquities riſe before us as a thick cloud! which obſcures the brightneſs of that eternal Sun of righteouſneſs, which would otherwiſe illuminate our underſtandings with its marvellous light. Who, therefore, (ſays the illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated penitent ſoul) ſhall deliver us from the body of this death? who ſhall take from us the weight of our ſins under which we groan inceſſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? who ſhall ſave us from the wrath to come? "Men and brethren what ſhall we do to be ſaved?" The condition of our reconciliation and redemption are very clearly expreſſed in the ſacred oracles of truth; the placability of the divine nature is repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly aſſerted; he is repreſented to us in the adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble character of a God of mercy, long ſuffering and of unſpeakable kindneſs; as a Being ready to blot out our tranſgreſſions from the celeſtial regiſter, on our ſincere repentance, and to remember them no more.</p>
            <p>This important and intereſting doctrine was typified under the law, ſpoken of by the prophets, and gloriouſly aſſerted by the Son of God, who is
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:037439_0156_100D444918C7B060"/>
our Mediator with the Father, and the hope of our future glory. In his character was diſplayed to mankind, in the moſt eminent and ſtriking manner, the provident care, mercy and goodneſs of God toward the whole rational creation; who like ſheep have gone aſtray from the univerſal Shepherd and Biſhop of Souls, who have widely wandered from the paths of purity and holineſs, which are ways of pleaſantneſs and peace; that path of the juſt man, which (like the luminous orb as it ariſes in our hemiſphere) ſhines with increaſing refulgency, ſplendor and brightneſs, till it arrives at the meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian altitude of a gloriouſly perfect day! This path leads all who ſteadily purſue its direction, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of experience, through the wilderneſs of this world to the grand and ultimate end of our creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to that compleat fruition of bliſs that is figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively repreſented to us by "a City that hath foundations whoſe builder and maker God is <note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. xi. 10.—</note>;" a City "whoſe walls are ſalvation, and whoſe gates are eternal praiſe <note n="†" place="bottom">Iſaiah ix. 18.</note>" a City that hath no need of the elementary light of ſun, moon and ſtars, "for the Lord God and the Lamb are the light there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <note n="‡" place="bottom">Rev. xxi. 23.</note>" a City where God reigns triumphantly amongſt his ſaints, and is to them an inexhauſtable fountain of light and felicity; there the weary pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim finds an end of all his anxiety and labour, and receives the reward of his faith, the fruition of his hopes, even the ſalvation of his ſoul.</p>

               <pb n="140" facs="unknown:037439_0157_100D444AAE80E458"/>The important meſſage which Chriſt had in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from his Father and our Father, from his God and our God, was, that he compaſſionated his creatures, encompaſſed with the diſtreſſes which their ſins had brought upon them, that he willed not their everlaſting ſeparation from him the ſource of happineſs, that he was willing they ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to him; he therefore called upon them to "Repent and be converted that their ſins might be forgiven them, and that they might finally enter into his reſt." This was the intereſting doctrine which the Saviour of Man promulgated, and happy are thoſe who hear and obey it. <q>Repent and be converted that your ſins may be forgiven you.</q> It is not the aſſent of the lip and of the tongue to the glorious truths of the Goſpel; but a ſurrender of the will and affections, a renovation of heart, and conformity to the divine Image, which can alone gain us admiſſion into the New Jeruſalem, the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God.</p>
            <p>If we take an impartial ſurvey of our paſt lives, review our frequent revoltings, and compare our conduct with the convictions we have often receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of right and wrong, virtue and vice, there is ſcarcely a Soul preſent but muſt feel ſome degree of remorſe, ſome degree of repentance for the turpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of his morals, and his want of love, obedience and gratitude to ſo gracious a Father, who has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed

Thoſe who have been cleanſed in ſome degree by the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of contrition, are often defiled again by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of that iniquity which in the moments of their humiliation they had determined to renounce and forſake, they are again caught in the ſnare of their luſts, and captivated by thoſe objects which have a tendency to alienate their affections from the ſupreme good. Thus when the force of conviction again ſounds the awakening alarm, they are ready to query with ſurpriſe and anxiety "what is to be done in this afflictive dilemma to which our incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy to our virtuous reſolutions has reduced us? ſhall we deſpair of that divine mercy we have ſo often abuſed, of that goodneſs we have ſo long tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled with?" God forbid! rather proſtrate your Souls at the Throne of Grace, and humbly implore the continued mercy of the univerſal Parent. As a Father pitieth his Children, ſo he pitieth them that fear him; he knoweth our frame, he remembereth that we are but duſt; beſeech him therefore to ſend

forth help from his holy ſanctuary, that you may be ſtrengthened to renew and keep your covenants with him; refrain from the commiſſion of evil, and wait on him in the ſilence of all fleſh; ſince it hath pleaſed him again to enlighten your darkneſs, and thus to give you to ſee yourſelves as you are ſeen of him; he may alſo be pleaſed to enflame your hearts with that celeſtial fire which purgeth away all the intellectual filth and droſs, that prevents the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of the ſoul godward, and renders it an unfit habitation for his holineſs to dwell in. As our backſlidings have frequently corrected us and cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our minds with anxiety, let our future conduct directed by his Grace, atone for what is paſſed, and by a converſation ordered aright, let us glorify our Father who is in heaven.</p>
            <p>I feel at this ſeaſon the influence (in degree) of that celeſtial charity which breathes through Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel to the whole creation of God, wiſhing ſalvation to every ſoul that inhabits the earth; in which I entreat you (as a being ſubject to the ſame infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which you ſometimes unavailably deplore) "re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and be converted;" repentance you have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently experienced, but too little I fear of that eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential converſion which the goſpel of Jeſus propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, 'tis highly probable that ſome perſons preſent have ſeen the neceſſity of that renovation of heart and reformation of manners intended by converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

but urged by the powerful prevalency of their luſts, would if poſſible find ſome other remedy for a wounded conſcience, than that which the ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the goſpel requires, as a neceſſary prelude to the favour of God; like the young Man in the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, they have been animated with a deſire to be enrolled amongſt the diſciples of Jeſus, who are called heirs of God and co-heirs with Chriſt of that inheritance which is incorruptible and full of glory; they have aſked counſel of the wonderful counſellor, addreſſing him with this important queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, "what good thing ſhall, I do, that I may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit eternal life <note n="*" place="bottom">Mark i. 17.</note>?" yet when the unchangeable terms of ſalvation have been propoſed, when they have been told that they muſt part with all their idols, they have gone away ſorrowful, the terms have appeared too hard for them to comply with; and like Naaman who wanted to be cured of his leproſy, yet was ſtaggered at the ſimplicity of the prophet's direction, are crying out "are not Aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Pharpar, rivers of Damaſcus, better than all the waters of Iſrael, may I not waſh in them and be clean <note n="†" place="bottom">11 Kings v. 12.</note>?" thus numbers amongſt mankind are ſtriving to elude the meaſures which the goſpel of Jeſus enjoins, and are ſubſtituting others in their ſtead, which are better adapted to ſooth the carnal mind, and prevent that mortification which human nature ſhrinks from.</p>

            <p>In the world there are many voices which corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpond not with the voice of Chriſt, the only Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd of Souls (whom we ought to hear and obey in all things) but are the voices of thoſe who preach for hire and divine for money; who look for their gain from their reſpective quarters; and as to ſuch conſcientious men who cannot put into their mouths, they are ready to make war againſt them; theſe have found it for their worldly intereſt to lead the delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded people from, rather than to Chriſt, that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous high prieſt of the chriſtian religion; they have attempted to render that myſterious which the holy Ghoſt has left clear, and to perplex the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of mankind with vain metaphyſical ſpeculations, without making them either wiſer or better.

hopes which it is to be feared will finally end in diſappointment. There are others who aſſume the office of miniſters, (the purity of whoſe intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons my charity will not permit me to doubt,) who like a man that attempts to anſwer a queſtion before he has fully heard it, have too precipitately embark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the important work of inſtructing Souls rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the affairs of ſalvation; theſe are like Ephraim "a cake not turned <note n="*" place="bottom">Hoſea vii. 8.</note>," are not yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the way of God perfectly, and whilſt they are teaching others, had need themſelves to be taught what are the firſt principles of the oracles of God; they have run on the Lord's errant unſent, and therefore have not eſſentially profited the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; they have taken upon them to guide thoſe who are inquiring what they ſhall do to be ſaved, and have led them indeed from the confines of Egypt, but leave them (undirected to the ſpiritual Moſes) to wander in uncertainty and to compaſs a mountain of doubts in the wilderneſs. May the Lord Almighty in his mercy gather theſe who are wandering as ſheep without a ſhepherd, and lead them into the ſacred incloſure of his fold, into eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſafety.</p>

            <p>The humble addreſs which the prodigal made to his father (in that excellent parable given us by Chriſt) the father's reply to it, and the manner of his reception into favour, is exceedingly expreſſive of the becoming penitence of the one and the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the other; "I have ſinned againſt heaven and in thy ſight, and am no more worthy to be called thy ſon, make me therefore as one of thy

            <p>If ye abide in the word of faith by which ye have been taught, the malice of men nor devils, nor all the united powers of darkneſs, ſhall be able to pluck you out of the hand of him, who is your judge, your king, your protector, your father and your everlaſting friend.

It lies beyond the reach of the moſt exalted human faculties to comprehend his wiſdom, throughout the righteous adminiſtration of his providence, which is unſearchable! It is our duty as frail de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent beings to meet every diſpenſation of his providence with that reſignation of ſpirit, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly breathes the humble language of "not my will O Lord! but thine, be done in all things!" Under the evils which we feel and which our pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence could not prevent, let us rather implore di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine aid to endure them with patience, than to pray they may be removed from us; left like igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant children we ſhould ſeek to avoid that portion

            <p>The ſoul by reaſon of its connection with the body, incloſed within the walls of fleſh, cannot extend its views and employ its faculties on divine objects, without frequent interruption; but when the days of its captivity are accompliſhed, it will be capable of a more glorious expanſion in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Immortality, and (if bearing the inſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of holineſs) will be put in poſſeſſion of that joy which is unſpeakable and full of glory. Therefore in all thoſe calamities to which we are ſubject in the houſe of our pilgrimage, we have a place of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge to flee to, where ſafety is alone to be ſound; though indeed we muſt feel in degree as men, yet we may poſſeſs the patience, reſignation and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fortitude of Chriſtians, who are looking for a better country, a more excellent inheritance in that city whoſe inhabitant cannot ſay "I am ſick."</p>
            <p>Be ye therefore ſtedfaſt, immoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, foraſmuch as ye know that your labour ſhall not be in vain. Be ye in your ſeveral ſtations in the church, and

            <p>Finally, my brethren, farewell! I commend you to God, the ſhepherd of Iſrael, and to the word of his grace; this is alone able to build us up in the moſt holy faith, to direct our feet in the way of Righteouſneſs and peace; and finally to put us in poſſeſſion of a glorious inheritance amongſt the ſaints, that will never fade away.</p>

               <pb n="155" facs="unknown:037439_0172_100D446AD8DA1368"/>I would endeavour to lead our minds to a proper contemplation upon this unſpeakable gift, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly wiſh we may be ſo wiſe as to enter into it with that reverence, with that attention, and with ſolemn worſhip, which become worthy receivers of a multitude of unmerited mercies.</p>
            <p>The holy ſcriptures of the New Teſtament (which are preſerved through mercy) give us a large and particular account of the incarnation, life, ſufferings, death, and aſcenſion of the holy Jeſus; and it were much to be wiſhed there was a more general attention amongſt the profeſſors of the name of Chriſt, to ponder his adorable acts, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to accompany him in reverent recollecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the various ſteps he took whilſt in the body prepared for him; as it might lay a well grounded hope (if we accompany him with care) to be found coheirs with him in the celeſtial regions, in his glorified ſtate, hereafter.</p>
            <p>I account the holy ſcriptures an excellent trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and I wiſh the riſing generation, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to know the ſcriptures from their youth, which, through faith in the great and glorious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject they propoſe, are able to make us wiſe unto ſalvation: but notwithſtanding the glorious and
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:037439_0173_100D446DB2D16640"/>
excellent account of the holy Jeſus, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to his being incarnate, converſing among men, and the delivery of many excellent precepts, the holy apoſtle mentions the ſum and ſubſtance of the chriſtian religion as an unſpeakable gift, which there was no language ſufficiently able to define and ſet forth. I have thought, notwithſtanding this, it is an intelligible, though an unſpeakable gift; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible to the meaneſt capacity; for the reſt of ſaints is the proviſion of God, for the various ranks of mankind, high and low, rich and poor: he is the God and Father of us all, who is over all, through all, and in all: and the religion of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Jeſus is not deſigned to be placed beyond the reach of vulgar capacities; its glorious nature not dependant on the ſkill of human literature to unſold; it is eaſy and intelligible to the mind willing to learn it, and lies open to the ſincere and upright heart, who conſiders it not as a ſeene of abſtruſe difficulties, myſterious matters, but as intended to regulate the affections, to rectify our natures, to guide us in wiſdom, and afterwards receive us into glory.</p>
            <p>Some people think themſelves too high for reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; theſe are miſtaken, for it adds dignity to the greateſt ſtate, and, in it is real nobility. I have ſometimes feared ſome people think themſelves too
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:037439_0174_100D4470A43597A0"/>
low for religion, as if it was the proper buſineſs of the rich, who had leiſure and opportunity; and that the poor and laborious, the exerciſed and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed part of the family, were beneath religion. They are both miſtaken; for the God and Father of all, with an equal eye, beholds his family, his mighty family, the angels, the arch-angels, the triumphant hearts, and the militant hearts, who by faith and patience are ſeeking to paſs their time here in a conformity to their elder brethren: that, when mortality ſhall be ſwallowed up of immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they might join the family on high.</p>
            <p>I confeſs, in this point of view, I look upon the workmanſhip of God, and have no more doubt of a part in the family of the Moſt High, whilſt converſant in the viciſſitudes of an earthly pilgrim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, than when this tranſient habitation of clay ſhall reſolve to its original matter, and the eyes that ſee me now ſhall ſee me no more: we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering upon eternity and an indiſſoluble connexion with ever and ever. In this life God has diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied our ranks in unerring wiſdom, for the great purpoſe of his will; there is nothing low, in the eye of the Univerſal Parent, but vice, irreligion, a forgetfulneſs of God, and ourſelves, and alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to his nature; this, throughout all ranks, is eternally and unalterably inconſiſtent with accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:037439_0175_100D44729FA234A0"/>
in the ſight of God; he has adapted inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to every ſtate and condition, in unerring wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. It behoves all, carefully and diligently, to ſeek a right improvement of this unſpeakable gift, to ſee that it was not beſtowed in vain.</p>
            <p>We are not at all aſhamed or afraid of advoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the cauſe of ſimple chriſtianity, under the ancient definition or deſcription of it, given by the holy Jeſus, as "the leaven which the woman took and hid in three meaſures of meal."—Not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to define religion as deſigned to reform the heart, to make men pure and acceptable in the ſight of God, not wearied in our endeavours to impreſs on the minds of men, the abſolute neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this unſpeakable gift in themſelves, as religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on flows from this gift; a gift adapted to every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and every ſtate, and which the ſame apoſtle, writing to his ſons, after the common faith, further illuſtrates in a manner worthy of all our attention; and, if regarded, would put an end to the controverſies amongſt chriſtians; "he gave himſelf for us that he might redeem us, from all ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and purify unto himſelf a peculiar people zealous of good works."</p>
            <p>I own I look upon this to be the great deſign of this unſpeakable gift, and a compendious account
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:037439_0176_100D44742B8EF0A0"/>
of the religion of Chriſt; "the grace of God that brings ſalvation, hath appeared to all men, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, that denying ungodlineſs and worldly luſt, we ſhould live righteouſly, ſoberly, and godly, looking for the bleſſed hope and glorious appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the great God and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a peculiar people zealous of good works." I can hardly think that any are ſo hardy as to aſſert there's either falſehood or inconſiſtency in this apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolic definition of the great deſign of the religion of Chriſt, however their lives may contradict their profeſſion, and give the lie to their own aſſent to the truths of religion. Scarce any can arrive to that degree of obduracy of mind, as to deny this to be the glorious intention of the religion of Chriſt: here is the unſpeakable gift, "he gave himſelf for us;" he laid aſide his glory, he came in the form of a ſervant, in a ſtate of humiliation and poverty; was introduced into the world in a ſtable, laid in a manger, was (and not upon his own account) "a man of ſorrow and acquainted with grief;" the whole ſeries of his life was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued act of illuſtrious virtue, inſtructive and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary, to ſhew us the dignity of the religion he came to eſtabliſh, and to impreſs the minds of
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:037439_0177_100D4475B776FD68"/>
mankind, that they ſhould walk as he walked. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having accompliſhed a pilgrimage of thirty-three years, he gave himſelf for us on Calvary's Mount, "the juſt for the unjuſt that he might bring us to God"—"He trod the wine-preſs alone, and of the people there was none with him." He that had le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of angels at command, bore the contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinners; and that ſacred countenance impreſt with divine glory, was ſpit upon, crowned with thorns, as the moſt notorious malefactor; yet, as a ſheep, dumb before its ſhearers, "he opened not his mouth."</p>
            <p>I cannot avoid endeavouring to impreſs the recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of theſe awful truths upon the minds of all ſuch as profeſs to call upon the name of the Father, by Jeſus Chriſt, and hope for ſalvation through him; that they might accuſtom themſelves to rumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate upon the ſtupendous exhibition of divine love; that they might carefully inquire how far the end is anſwered to them, and might apply, to their own advantage, that unſpeakable gift, "he gave himſelf for us, was crucified, dead and buried;" but he aroſe again, and trampled over the powers of death, hell, and the grave, "led captivity cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and gave gifts to men, even the rebellious;" for this great purpoſe, the purpoſe of human re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, that he might redeem us; that through
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:037439_0178_100D4478766CB570"/>
his ſtripes, we might know the glorious progreſs of redemption experimentally. As individuals, it is worth while to conſider the terms of this gift, and its intention; that it ſhould produce neceſſary fruits of all worthy receivers; "he gave himſelf for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity."</p>
            <p>I have frequently feared a dangerous miſtake with reſpect to this; have heard ſome expreſs their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of redemption from the penalty of ſin, but not from the body of ſin; though there may be an unwarrantable ſtreſs laid upon it, it is one of the moſt powerful calls to righteouſneſs and holineſs of life. I have met with not a few who have conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it in a different light, as a kind of toleration for acting inconſiſtent with the purity of the divine nature, and an allowance for continuing in human frailty. The mind having loſt its faith in the ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of the divine power, has miſtaken the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this gift, and has looked upon it as a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from wrath rather than iniquity; "what ſhall we continue in ſin that grace may abound?" There were ſuch, in the primitive ſtate of the church. I have heard ſome, ſo remote from the nature of the chriſtian religion, the power and purity attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, as to aſſert, there is no poſſibility of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption from the reigning power of ſin in this life; that the chriſtan redemption is unalterable,
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:037439_0179_100D447B0DF78FC0"/>
as to this, redeeming us from all iniquity, having doubled the ſufficiency of the divine grace; to change effectually, from a ſtate of corruption, and having loſt their faith in the power of God, it has been impoſſible for them to make a proficiency in the divine life, But we have the utmoſt reaſon to be aſſured, that it is "from all iniquity," from the reigning power of tranſgreſſion, that the grace of God is able to do all things for us, to change the vile body of our affections, and make it like the body of Chriſt, able to take away our ſtony hearts, and give us hearts of fleſh: but this brings religion nearer home than many chuſe to have it; takes it from the head to the heart, lays the axe to the root of the tree, and brings home to an anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of the ſearch into their own ſtates.</p>
            <p>This is a grand reaſon for rejecting the chriſtian religion; but we muſt ſubſcribe to all the truths of the goſpel, or be in the gall of bitterneſs and in the bond of iniquity. But the unerring wiſdom of God has been rejected, men have took them ſelves out of the hands of God, and gone their own way, have endeavoured by the multiplicity of profeſſions, and their own external performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and every invention of the human mind in the myſteries of ungodlineſs, to evade this grand <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, "to redeem us from all iniquity;" but to put not only the mark of the forehead but these
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:037439_0180_100D447C99CDE178"/>
more hidden tranſgreſſions. There's a filthineſs of ſpirit, that, to an all-ſeeing eye, is equally deteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; ſacred is our judge; there is a judgment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeat covered with mercy to a hairs breadth; but we cannot advance one attribute and deprecate another. Though wonderful is his mercy, yet juſtice, righteouſneſs and truth, are eſſentials in the attributes of the moſt high God. "Let me die the death of the righteous," let me rejoice when I paſs through the regions of death,—is the wiſh of all; but they would not be brought to the teſt, that redemption from all iniquity, that tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough cleanſing, that turning of the hand upon them, and purging away not only their droſs, but their tin, and reprobate ſilver. There's abundance of that amongſt profeſſors, there's a ſelf-righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the law; it conſiſts not only in action, but ſpeculation, in ſplended opinions; this opinion hath paſſed for faith, and cheated many to wretchedneſs. Opinion reſembles faith ſo much, that the eye had need be opened to diſcern the difference; yet a great one there is: many have ſtrong opinions concerning the work of religion; ſome have looked upon it as inſtantaneous, ſome otherwiſe. I confeſs with reſpect to that inſtanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous work, "I have not ſo learned Chriſt;" far, be it from me to judge another man's ſervant, but I have not ſo learned Chriſt, as to know, that to be an inſtantaneous, but a gradual work. Some
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:037439_0181_100D447F24E85188"/>
think there is a ſudden death to ſin, and a new birth to righteouſneſs, in a moment. I have not traced the conduct of people profeſſing the chriſtian religion, with an uncharitable eye; but I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten obſerved that inſtantaneous work to be of a ſhort lived continuance; have ſeen ſome recur back again to their ſins, and their latter end has been worſe than the beginning. When God ſaid let there be light, there was light, a ſucceſſion of days and nights, the beauties of creation were gradually brought forth, till man was made in God's image.</p>
            <p>I have not been deſtitute of ſome degree of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious experience, the praiſe I dedicate to God, the fruits to your ſervice. Religion has wore this aſpect with me, it has been a gradual work, a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual advancement from faith to faith; but when people are enriched with unfelt truths, they call a ſtrong perſuaſion of mind, faith, when it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opinion. Faith is promotive of redemption, the ſaint's victory; this faith that works by love, ſubverts the ſtrong holds of Satan, reſtores people to a ſtate of acceptance with God, impreſſing the features of the king of heaven upon all their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: but this opinion, this miſtaken opinion, would paſs by redemption from all iniquity; the leaven of the kingdom, would lead to a variety of actions, abundance of words and profeſſions, and
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:037439_0182_100D4481C41228F8"/>
ſet the mind afloat above that ſacred leaven, that unſpeakable gift, which cannot be fully uttered. The Lord preſerve us from this dangerous miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take.</p>
            <p>I ſpeak to a people, many of whom are, I truſt inquiring after things of the higheſt moment; I wiſh you well on your way, that your minds might not only reverence that unſpeakable gift, but trace the ſource, and purſue the end. He gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, that he might cleanſe us from all ſilthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of fleſh and ſpirit, eſtabliſh our affections on things above; that the mind that was in Chriſt, might be in us. I look upon this to be the deſign of chriſtianity: this unſpeakable gift, the religion of Jeſus, works ſecretly, powerfully and effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; ſometimes it draws to expreſſions, oftentimes otherwiſe: the occaſion of praiſe ceaſed not when there was ſilence in heaven for half an hour. May we ſo hide the word in our hearts, as to witneſs its progreſs there. I have feared the multitude of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation has betrayed the minds of the people; been afraid of people talking away religion by frequent uſe, familiarizing their minds to treat the things of God not with that feeling reverence, flowing from this unſpeakable gift. Far be it from me to enfeeble my mind bent after things of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt moment. I know I regret with you, the too general converſation of the world goes upon other
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:037439_0183_100D4484038A0D38"/>
ſubjects; and things appertaining to life and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, are rather objects of contempt and deriſion, than of that humble reverential awe that becometh us. This is too much the caſe; yet there is a poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of talking away religion, by a multiplicity of converſation, paſſing beyond our own light. I would rather endeavour to know what the Holy Ghoſt meant by that ſilence in heaven for half an hour, than make religion too cheap by converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:—Keep it in the heart: too much diſcourſe carries off the eſſence of religion; keep the mind as a garden incloſed; a proper attention to this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable gift, will tend more to comfort and ſtrengthen than where a profeſſion of words carries away the proper ſenſibility of our ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. I know the matter requires diſtinction; I want not to diſcourage any thing of an heavenly birth: but fear ſome have been carried out of their depth, the divine ſpirit of religion has been eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated, greatly to their loſs. Let not thoſe who care for none of theſe things, run into diſcourſe ſubverſive of religion. Wiſdom leads in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle paths of judgment; and though the gift is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable, yet we have a right underſtanding of the effects upon our own minds. We know there is a ſun in the firmament, we feel it's warmth, it extends it's light and warmth through the globe, but the utmoſt intent of it's nature is inexplicable; the diviſion of its rays, the ſource of it's heat,
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:037439_0184_100D44858DFE7178"/>
after what manner placed in the planetary world, or how formed; theſe are inexplicable, ſo is the ſun of righteouſneſs; but though the properties of the ſun be unſpeakable, we know, we rejoice in it's effect; we have indubitable proofs of it's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence: ſo the unſpeakable gift, the ſun of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; to enlighten men, to guide them in wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to unite them to their elder brother, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſh their affections and ſet them on things above. Though an unſpeakable gift, yet intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, reaches to the minds of men, affects them, quickens them, raiſes them from death and dead works, to a contemplation of thoſe things of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite conſequence to them.</p>
            <p>I cannot but intreat you of the riſing generation, carefully to attend to this gift,—in it's right-hand are length of days, on it's left-hand are riches and honor: watch unto prayer, be not aſhamed of this unſpeakable gift, and it's tendency. What is the reaſon of the ſcepticiſm and infidelity that is amongſt us? it is enough now to make one ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, to revive, in the remembrance of chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, their own principles. What is the reaſon that youth falls a prey to the gloomy doctrines of infidelity that abound in this age? the want of attending to this unſpeakable gift. Were their minds endued with a ſenſe of it's virtue, there would be no more reaſoning them out of the
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:037439_0185_100D44871A38AD50"/>
efficacy of religion, and the exiſtance of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable gift, than that there was no ſun in the firmament. From the ſtrongeſt of all convictions, that of experience, they could give in their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to the nature, power, and ſpirit of the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian religion, and their minds would he enabled to ſee that this is He, and we look not for another.</p>
            <p>I beſeech you, therefore, my friends, ſuch of you as know this unſpeakable gift, ſeek after a capacity of praiſing God, of aſcribing thanks for this unſpeakable gift: he that offers praiſe, glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies God, " and to him that ordereth his converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion aright will I ſhew forth my ſalvation." We have abundance of what is called public worſhip, ſometimes many exterior acts, which amuſe the minds of mankind; but vain and fooliſh is it to apprehend infinity to be organized like us, and the ears of him that filleth immenſity to be like ours. Thanks be to God for his unſpeakable gift; let it appear by its own influence; it is the living that praiſe him; the glory of the workman is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by the beauty of the workmanſhip. Was the mind endued with this unſpeakable gift, and all within us brought into ſubjection to it's divine nature and tendency, there would be an inceſſant oblation ariſing with holy efficacy to a God-hearing prayer; though ſilent with regard to the human ear, yet intelligible to him. I would recommend
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:037439_0186_100D448A428EBD48"/>
you, my brethren and ſiſters, that profeſs this gift, I beſeech you by the mercies of God, by your hopes of ſtanding at laſt accepted in the beloved, you that have profeſſed this gift, dwell with it, abide with it, let it have its utmoſt effect upon your minds. Be what you profeſs, lie not in the ſight of God and man, or the Holy Ghoſt; live by that unſpeakable gift, and you will ſhew forth his praiſe that has called you to glory. Attend to it that it may ſhine more and more to the perfect day: there's not a more deteſtabie character than a profeſſor of this unſpeakable gift, that contradicts it in practice; high in profeſſion, low in practice; flattery and ſmooth tales may pleaſe fools, but are inconſiſtent with the ſolemn work of the ſouls of men. Let the profeſſors of this religion place themſelves in a conſpicuous point of view, and be what they profeſs, as they would be fixed amongſt the ſtars in eternal glory ariſing from their firm attachment to this unſpeakable gift.</p>

My mind was ready to alledge, as ſome at this time of day may be, "How can we believe without evidence? there is not a ſufficient evidence of truth to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince my judgment, or to induce me to believe." I know this has been the allegation of ſome: but I have found there is no deficiency of evidence, but an unwillingneſs to admit the ſorce of that evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which would properly influence the mind; and I have reaſon to apprehend this has been the caſe with others; for if there was a thorough ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and diſpoſition of mind to receive the truth in the love of it; to endeavour after it in its genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine ſimplicity; to look at with a ſingle eye; and,
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:037439_0190_100D4494280456C8"/>
if I may be allowed the expreſſion, to ſuppreſs or baniſh all the "buts and ifs;" we ſhould ſoon find the evidence of the Chriſtian Religion to be lively and inconteſtible, and effectually to operate to make us wiſe and good; wiſe, with the wiſdom that is to ſalvation; and good, with the goodneſs that is of God, the ſource of goodneſs.</p>
            <p>But whilſt people "take counſel, and not of God," and ſuffer themſelves to be "covered with a covering, and not of his ſpirit <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſaiah xxx. 1.</note>," they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to admit the force of thoſe truths which would "ſeparate the precious from the vile, and purify us according to his word."—While this is the caſe that many deviate in point of faith, they may complain of the want of evidence reſpecting the certainty and truth of the Chriſtian Religion; and complain with as much juſtice, as a man who wilfully hides himſelf in darkneſs, complains of his incapacity of ſeeing. For we have ſuch an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and underſtanding imparted by the light and grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as doubtleſs abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly diſplays the immediate regard and love of God, as recorded in holy writ; and from which I freely acknowledge an internal illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on neceſſary, for all that would have valid claim to the Chriſtian Religion; whereby we obtain a firm
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:037439_0191_100D449647188358"/>
aſſurance of, and a well-grounded belief in, thoſe glorious truths.</p>
            <p>We have ſometimes been accuſed of allegorizing away the important truths of the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as recorded in holy writ: it is far, very far, from our intention or inclination! We want to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force them upon ourſelves, upon our brethren, with all that requiſite weight which commands their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; calling to a belief of heart, not a mere aſſent with the tongue; but "a belief of heart unto righteouſneſs <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. x. 10.—</note>."</p>
            <p>We have been diſtinguiſhed, and are not aſhamed of the diſtinction, for preaching Chriſt within; but we never preach a Chriſt within, oppoſed to, or derogating from, a Chriſt without.—We fully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not only in his glorious and gracious appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance amongſt the ſons of men, "as in the volume of the book it is written <note n="†" place="bottom">Heb. x. 7.—</note>;" but we alſo believe in his inward and ſpiritual appearance, "the ſecond time without ſin unto ſalvation <note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. ix. 28.—</note>;" in which we are ſupported by a "cloud of witneſſes <note n="‖" place="bottom">Ibid. xii. 1.</note>," and by the doctrine of the holy Author of the Chriſtian Religion, inforcing his inward and ſpiritual mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation (the manifeſtation of his grace) in as clear and indubitable a manner, as from the teſtimonies delivered concerning his external appearance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="175" facs="unknown:037439_0192_100D4497D5B071C8"/>But the myſtery of ungodlineſs hath powerfully wrought with ſome who profeſs the Chriſtian name, in oppoſition to the force of thoſe teſtimonies with regard to his internal appearance, or manifeſtation of himſelf in the hearts of mankind; and to render inadmiſſible the doctrine of an inward and ſpiritual communion, the revelation of light, life, and good to the ſouls of men, immediately imparted for our redemption and ſanctification.—This would lead people home from the flowery path of eaſe and ſpeculation, into the arduous one of prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice: it would transfer religion from the head to the heart: and, in its progreſs, would remove every obſtacle to the admiſſion of the doctrine of an inward and ſpiritual manifeſtation of the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But there hath been a lamentable defection from the life and ſpirit of true Chriſtianity, wherein the old man, under all the pomp of opinion, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to indubitable truths, ſtill remains in full poſſeſſion of every inordinate love, and his goods are at eaſe. A mind diſguiſed with Jacob's voice, and Eſau's hands, ſound orthodox principles, with a ſchiſmatic heart, ingroſs the formaliſt of all names and diſtinctions to religion; the old man being at eaſe with his goods, in a ſtate of ſelf-ſufficiency, either rejoicing under a form, and the falſe ſhade of opinion and regularity of conduct, or in the
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:037439_0193_100D4499655A1E58"/>
pomp of a ſpecious external appearance; wherein ſome continue poſſeſſed of an happy tranquillity or eaſe of mind, and are endeavouring to build up a tabernacle quiet and ſafe, content with a form, or depending upon a bare belief in the doctrines of the Chriſtian Religion.—But there is a work, whereby the old earth and the old heavens are made to ſhake, and muſt be removed; which is of the adorable mercy and grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, when he thus may reveal himſelf;—</p>
            <p>"Yet once more will I ſhake not the earth only, but alſo heaven <note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. xii. 27.</note>"—Not only the earth, not only againſt the inhabitants of the earth: but the work of God is made conſpicuous in the awakening of the ungodly, for their converſion from ſin and death, unto righteouſneſs and life.—"Yet once more will I ſhake heaven."— The glorious ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous appearances of truth, and doctrines recorded and aſſented to, but yet not reduced to experience; truths received and confeſſed by the tongue, but the heart revolting from their efficacious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence.</p>
            <p>"Yet once more will I ſhake not the earth only, but alſo heaven." And this word, yet once more, ſignifies the removing of thoſe things which are ſhaken. And undoubtedly the grace of our
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:037439_0194_100D449C68834EB0"/>
Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in its manifeſtation, procedure, and effects, would ſhake every falſe reſt in which any deluded ſoul may have fixed its repoſe: He would ſhake every falſe reſt among thoſe under all names and diſtinctions to religion, who are truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in name and in form, without the power, or an experience of its virtual effects upon the ſoul; theſe all appertain to one family:—and not only ſo but he would ſhake every falſe reſt, yea and the foundation, of thoſe who are building upon a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and upon the apoſtle's teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt; becauſe they are only building upon the credibility of thoſe truths, yet cannot experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally ſay, Through the grace of our Lord Jeſus, "We acknowledge truth, according to godlineſs <note n="*" place="bottom">Titus i. 1.</note>."</p>
            <p>They that are of the world, come here alſo to a houſe fortified with opinion, and are ſupporting themſelves in having obtained a clear, full, and conciſe knowledge of the truth of the Chriſtian Religion. But there is a power that will ſearch every falſe foundation, and overturn every ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial dependence on human production, that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the uniform tendency of his ſacred law, faſhioned upon the plan of unchangeable, everlaſting wiſdom.—It is not of man, or by man, but proceeds from the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, whereby thoſe truths are brought home
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:037439_0195_100D449F5A917F98"/>
to the hearts of mankind. The gracious effects of his powerful working, are manifeſted to bring us home from a ſtate of falſe dependence, that we may humbly and experimentally acknowledge, "In God is my ſalvation, and my glory, the rock of my ſtrength <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. lxii. 7.—</note>: in God alone is my truſt."</p>
            <p>But the ſtrong man, armed with opinion and belief, has nevertheleſs been purſuing vitiated affections: which people have endeavoured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and gloſſed over with a ſpecious lofty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, fully aſſenting to the truths handed forth from the experience of others, but unreduced to practice in themſelves.</p>
            <p>"While the ſtrong man armed keeps the palace, the things that he poſſeſſeth are in peace <note n="†" place="bottom">Luke xi. 21.—</note>; until a ſtronger than he overcome, and caſt him out with all his goods."—All thoſe things that are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the holineſs and purity of the divine nature, which are pointed clearly out, and may be underſtood, by the declaration of our Lord concerning the church, wherein "every plant that is not of my heavenly father's right hand planting, ſhall be rooted out <note n="‡" place="bottom">Math. xv. 13.</note>."—What would then become of all thoſe things, which a miſtaken judgment calls "but little things?" Of the pleaſures and amuſements of the preſent age, invented by the ſons of diſſipation, who add wings to their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:037439_0196_100D44A0E658A298"/>
and are carried forward with rapidity through time, unprepared, to a final judgment? What a multiplicity of thoſe things which are "not of the Father, but of the world that lies in wickedneſs <note n="*" place="bottom">1 John v. 19.</note>:" things of which I ſhall now particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſpeak; but they are ſuch as have no life in the LIFE of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in man, but are ever enemies to it, while the affections are earthly, and confined to this world, however the partiality of deluded minds may think to ſeek a reſource, and attempt to obviate the ſeeming rigours of the goſpel, or find for themſelves an eaſier and more flexible way, by reſting upon a mere belief of SYSTEMS (the goods belonging to the ſtrong man armed) wherein they endeavour to ſupport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and are high in profeſſion, but weak reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing practice! A ſpecies of deviation from the power of truth, proceeding from the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which would ſearch the ſecret of every heart! It would open to the view of the attentive mind their nature, and the ſituation they are in; what is of God, and what is not of God; what is pure, and what is impure: it would ever prove a more deciſive teſt in all our actions, a more certain criterion in our conduct through life, than, it is to be feared, the generality of Chriſtian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors have attained, and which it is abſolutely impoſſible for the ſtrong man armed to produce,
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:037439_0197_100D44CEB5103A80"/>
with all his ſeeming ſanctity of the fleſh, or ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous ſupport of belief, and a multitude of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal performances; notwithſtanding he may endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to plead for the law and the commandment, and think thereby to attain the mark of Chriſt's fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, who walk therein all the days of their lives.</p>
            <p>But although they are thus lifted up in their minds, there is an omniſcient and omnipreſent Being, who cannot be deceived or impoſed upon; and it is impoſſible to invalidate that invariable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to live under the power of the croſs of Chriſt, however they may endeavour to find means, by profeſſing his name without taking up a croſs, to the inordinate pleaſures and purſuits of this world, or attribute to themſelves the merits of his death, without a death unto ſin, and a new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth unto righteouſneſs, wherein alone we are made partakers of an everlaſting glory.</p>
            <p>I beſeech you by the moſt powerful motive of the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that every one may endeavour to cultivate in your minds a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſenſe of religion; and that we may all experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the purity and ſanctity of its nature to operate in our hearts; and, as members of one family, though diſtinguiſhed by various names, we may continue as brethren and fellow-pilgrims, in our

paſſage through the wilderneſs of this world, to an endleſs glory, that we may run with patience the arduous race, although through diſtreſs of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and probation, to an inheritance "incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, undefiled, and that fadeth not away."</p>
            <p>I beſeech you by the mercies of God, by every powerful motive, in the language of love, the love of God, which lives in my heart, lay hold of the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by which alone our hearts and minds can experimentally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that it is by the virtue of it we are cleanſed, purified, and redeemed from the pollutions and defilements of the world; and whereby we become faſhioned in the image of righteouſneſs and true holineſs.</p>
            <p>Let us next conſider the grace of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt as offered for our redemption. And I have no doubt of its being acknowledged, by all who have any underſtanding of true Chriſtianity, or care about their immortal ſouls, that the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt manifeſtly leads to the doctrine of "Repentance from dead works, and of faith towards God;" to a redemption of the ſoul from death, hell, and the grave; conſequently, from that ſtate of puniſhment due to ſinners, where the ungodly receive the reward of their diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:—neither have I any doubt of our being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied

            <p>But there has been a claim to redemption, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced in the apoſtaſy from the Life of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, maintained amongſt profeſſors under various names, who plead the impoſſibility of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from the power of ſin;—a redemption from the penalty, but not from the commiſſion; —a rederaption from the puniſhment, without a victory over the tranſgreſſing nature:—and herein

the myſtery of unrighteouſneſs hath powerfully wrought, and ſtill works, thus to ſubſtitute names for things, ſounds inſtead of ſubſtance, and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion inſtead of a lively poſſeſſion of its powerful and virtual effects upon the mind.—But it is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption from "all iniquity," whereby alone he will "purify unto himſelf a peculiar people, zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of good works."</p>
            <p>"Thou ſhalt call his name JESUS, for he ſhall ſave his people from their ſins <note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. i. 21.—</note>."

            <p>I apprehend this is the genuine nature of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Redemption, as propoſed by the goſpel, which will ſtand the teſt, and bring forth the glorious fruits of "Righteouſneſs, Peace and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt;" and wherein he will refine, and purify un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelf a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</p>

I have no doubt that many of your minds, under various names and diſtinctions to religion, have been at times touched with a feeling ſenſe of the nature and excellency of true Chriſtianity; with a bleſſed ſenſe of it, proceeding from the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.—May you ſo follow on, as to experience a farther progreſs in its efficacious operation upon your minds, and witneſs its lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening virtue into its own nature, drawing you from the temper and defilements of the world by a transformation of your minds from dead works, to ſerve the living God!—wherein you would tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly experience an increaſe in ſtrength, derived from him to whom "all power is given <note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. xxviii. 18.—</note>," power to affect every excellent purpoſe, and to fill up to you all thoſe relative attributes which are inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from the divine nature; and wherein he is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully communicating an holy evidence of faith in the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; a faith in "things not ſeen, the ſubſtance of things hoped for <note n="†" place="bottom">Heb. xi. 1.</note>."</p>

            <p>Yet notwithſtanding an happy advancement may be known, a ſtate of humble watchfulneſs is our duty, and our ſafety.—I cannot join with the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of thoſe, who maintain the doctrine of once in grace, ever in grace.—I believe that it is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for thoſe who have been viſited with a meaſure and manifeſtation of the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that have "taſted the good word of life, and of the powers of the world to come <note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. vi. 5.</note>," to fall, away.—It is neceſſary to continue in a ſtate of daily dependence on divine ſtrength, for our faithful perſeverance in the uniform progreſſive labour of a chriſtian life, and a daily walking with the God of our lives, to preſerve us from evil.—The apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, who ſeemed to entertain a requiſite diffidence

            <p>It is by virtue of the grace and love of God, that we are enabled to advance in a proper pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion through the various ſteps of a religious life: and which would kindle an ardour of affection in the mind, with defires for a continued ſupply of that heavenly virtue, which nouriſhes the ſoul up unto eternal life.—A want of this, makes us bow to the god of this world, and to things that are in it.—The love of money, riches, and the praiſe of men; which with various powers of ſeduction are preſented to our view, and our proſpects are bounded by the narrow conceptions of an earthly mind.—It is a love of thoſe things, which obſtructs the progreſs of religion.—A ſecret deviation from the love of God to a love of this world, has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in many.—But how can it be otherwiſe, ſince like will ever aſſimilate with its like? And while the body is terreſtial, the glory is terreſtial, and the body will continue engaged in the purſuit of earthly things.—For every mind will attend to
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:037439_0208_100D44B8A694B968"/>
its ſimilitude.—And while the body is terreſtial, the glory will remain terreſtial, however it may aſſume to matters of a higher nature, and ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or importance.—Yet while the glory is earthly, our views earthly, and confined to the pleaſures and purſuits of this world, our affections are earthly, and we are rendered incapable of that love, which is of a divine and heavenly nature.</p>
            <p>A terreſtial love preſides and is prevalent in the minds of many; which has obſtructed the power of truth, and been the cauſe of feeble purpoſes and feeble efforts, enfeebled minds with irreſolute in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, and proved the occaſion of a defection amongſt chriſtian profeſſors, who have been deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to form ſomething more amiable and agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or better adapted to their natural inclinations. —But there is a deficiency in their love, a wavering in affection, a diviſion of love, which is the cauſe of weakneſs and incapacity, to make a proper ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement in a chriſtian life, or improvement in the progreſſive work of religion upon the ſoul. For, as I have hinted, while the body is terreſtial, the glory is terreſtial, until we are created anew in Chriſt Jeſus, unto righteouſneſs; wherein our minds will become cloathed with a celeſtial glory, and by the power of divine grace, be ſet above every earthly love: and then the love of God will prevail in our minds, and we ſhall attain an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:037439_0209_100D44BAFAEBD108"/>
of additional ſtrength, ſteadily to perſevere in the arduous warfare of a chriſtian life. And the glory being celeſtial, our views are circumſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed within the limits of an heavenly love, wherein we are lifted up to God, being renewed in the ſpirit of our minds, and enabled to travel on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the glorious city of the ſaints' ſolemnity.</p>
            <p>But it is a deficiency of love, it is a cleaving to other things, inconſiſtent with the purity of the divine nature, that has ſlain ten thouſands!—A ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret defection of heart, which no human eye hath been privy to, has ſlain more than open prophanity! —A degeneracy of heart, a ſecret ſliding from the covenant of life, in thoſe who are turning aſide in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the path of irreligion, and a mental deviation from the purity of nature, and holineſs; the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary requiſite to an union and divine participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the love of God.</p>
            <p>I think it is ſaid with very great propriety, that "The love of money is the root of all evil; which while ſome have luſted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themſelves through with many ſorrows<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Tim. vi. 10.</note>." —But though it may ſeem to many not needful to tell of theſe things, methinks it is applicable to ſome in theſe days who would be deemed "men of God;"
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:037439_0210_100D44BC8AC7BC30"/>
and for whom I wiſh, as for myſelf, that when the heavens ſhall roll back as a ſcroll, and eternity ſhall open upon us; when our views of theſe lower objects ſhall vaniſh and diſappear; when the arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angels trump ſhall found to judgment, and a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous retribution is made, we may be found men of God!—But O man of God, that haſt theſe things in view, think on the unutterable proſpect of infinite happineſs, the reward of obedience, and flee theſe things. Flee the glory and ſplendor of this tranſient world; continue to follow after righteouſneſs, godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, faith, love, patience, meekneſs; fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art called, and haſt profeſſed a good profeſſion before many witneſſes.</p>
            <p>This is the language of the love of God to this aſſembly, that we may be "found men of God," when all the glory of this world, with it's ſplendour and dependencies, ſhall come to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion; that when every human aid ſhall vaniſh, and no worldly aſſiſtance is near, the love of God may cover our ſpirits in all our trials; that when every human help is totally ſuſpended, we may continue to feel the effects of his mercy and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs happily to ſpread in our minds, to their edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and unſpeakable joy.—Herein we receive a divine evidence of love, communicated from that boundleſs ſource of unutterable grace where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:037439_0211_100D44BE16F65F48"/>
he has viſited us, in order to dwell in our hearts, or that he may dwell in us richly.—And thus we are brought to diſcern the beauty of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the uniformity of love, to open the mind beyond the contracted view of human powers, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the glorious fruition of divine eſſential love, the love of God, that would thus dwell in our hearts and minds! and then we may witneſs him to be "with us all, always. Amen." He will be a light to our paths, and an aid at hand, while we are travelling through the various difficulties and probations in life.—May the ſhepherd of Iſrael, "who ſleeps not by day, nor ſlumbers by night," attend you! and may we place our whole depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon him, as our ſupport and all-ſufficient ſtrength in every needful time!</p>
            <p>And, dearly-beloved youth! you that are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering upon the ſtage of active life, be ever vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly concerned to improve the preſent moments, and that you may build beyond the habitation of ſorrow: that all the high places may be removed, and your minds become repleniſhed with true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation.—And as you are not always to expect one uniform joyous ſcene, but clouds of darkneſs ſometimes interrupt the proſpects of pleaſure, in your pilgrimage through life, prepare your minds, by zealouſly endeavouring after the love of God; and wait to know, in yourſelves, the unſpeakable
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:037439_0212_100D44C0DE246288"/>
advantage of his heavenly aid and aſſiſtance, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to conduct you through the various ſcenes of mortality, to the righteous and awful preſence of the Judge of heaven and earth; which will conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to ſuſtain you, when no human conſolation can afford relief; even when your offences appear as a flood, ſurrounded with temptation and diſtreſs, and you are ready to cry out, "who ſhall deliver me from the wrath of an offended Creator!" In this ſtate of anxious ſolicitude, your heavenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is mercifully pleaſed to ariſe, and adminiſter relief to ſuch, who are thus "hungering and thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after righteouſneſs;" and the cup of life and ſalvation is handed to their comfort, from the glorious helper, that in his ſtrength, you may be enabled to ſtand unſhaken in the troubleſome time!—And it is to theſe he waits to be gracious; a helper at hand, from whom proceeds every pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to aſſiſt, and every attribute of mercy, kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, goodneſs, and adorable condeſcenſion, are graciouſly diſpenſed to the ſons of men, wherein they are eſtabliſhed in righteouſneſs and true holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>"He touches the mountains, and they melt:" every obſtruction that would hinder the progreſs or advancement of this divine, eſſential, efficacious work of redemption upon the ſoul, muſt be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:

every unavailing connexion muſt give place to the ties of an ardent and ſanctified love.</p>
            <p>"He touches the mountains, and they melt; the everlaſting hills, they bow at his preſence." In his mercy we experience the removing of thoſe things that oppoſe or prevent an increaſe in the knowledge of God, or of the things appertaining to our everlaſting peace: in order that the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed pilgrim in his progreſs, may receive additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal ſtrength, to run with alacrity the race of a chriſtian life, and finally attain an happy union with the ſons of the morning, who ſing together for joy.</p>
            <p>It is the glorious benefits proceeding from the love of God, which I earneſtly intreat that the youth of all names and diſtinctions to religion, may carefully ſeek, and avail yourſelves of, that he may be with you through the various ſteps of a probationary life. And though you may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times have to travel in the exerciſed path of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and anxious diſtreſs, continue in hope, and you will feel his light to ariſe in your hearts, and witneſs an inward reſurrection unto life; that life that will never fade, but will remain when every tender and lawful connexion can no longer comfort, but muſt ſoon be diſſolved, and the ſympathy one for another ſhall be ineffectual to deliver. All the
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:037439_0214_100D44C528F71368"/>
tender connexions in life are but of uncertain dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and upon them all this inſcription is wrote, "They ſhall ſhortly periſh;" but the love of God never fades:—it is continued from generation to generation, and will remain when time ſhall be ſwallowed up in eternity;—It is this wherein we taſte of the goodneſs of God, and are made to drink the cup of life and ſalvation, and have to rejoice in the unſpeakable fruition of happineſs it affords to the ſanctified in heart, who in future time, as well as the preſent, will have to ſay, "Spring up, O well, and we will ſing unto thee;"—it will remain an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during portion to the ranſomed in Jacob, and to the redeemed in Iſrael; and will be an excellent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter in the time of probation and exerciſe, through the ſilent ſteps of anxiety and ſecret diſtreſs, known to none but God and thy own ſoul.</p>
            <p>He knows all things, by whoſe merciful aid we are ſuſtained through "the regions of the ſhadow of death," when every unavailing relation or human dependency ſhall diſappear and come to an end. What then, ſhall ſuſtain us, but the love of God? It is that which covers the head in the day of battle; and which I would recommend, with a fervent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, to you who are the hopes of the preſent age, that you ardently endeavour after the love of God, that will never decreaſe with age; it enlarges upon the mind, and is increaſed with an increaſe of
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:037439_0215_100D44C6D46567B0"/>
love: it proceeds from the throne of God, and ſpreads from the threſhold of his houſe: it is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued through the courts of his ſanctuary, and reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to the uttermoſt part of the earth; and is as a "river, the ſtreams whereof make glad the whole heritage of God."</p>
            <p>All the beauty and ſplendor of the world will fade; and the excellency of temporal enjoyments, which are the portion of uncertainty, ſhall ſhortly know their time and place no more; but the love of God, flowing from himſelf, returns upon the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſoul as a river that never paſſeth by, proceeding from the inexhauſtible ſource of love; it ſpreads through the various ſtates of mankind, and is diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed throughout the ſpiritual creation of his ſon, unlimited as eternity! A degree of which I feel upon my mind for this aſſembly, with an ardency that cannot be expreſſed, that he may be with you all, always. Amen!—For the love of God impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the ſanctified ſoul, and a portion of the Holy Ghoſt, and divine approbation in communion, hath been ſuch, as "eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the good things that God hath in ſtore for them that love him.</p>

            <p>This is the bond that binds, and wherein we are united to God, and know it to be a well, ſpringing up unto eternal life.—It is not in external helps, nor in the agreement of words, neither is it in the conſent of doctrine, or in the fine-ſpun regular ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tems, to conſtitute a "communion of the Holy Ghoſt." But it is as we are admitted to a ſacred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repaſt in the divine banquetting houſe, (wherein we offer the oblation of worſhip, a cloud of incenſe, ariſing from hearts prepared by the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and in the love of God,) that we are advanced to a divine communion of the Holy Ghoſt. A com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion not reſtrained to any diſtinction or profeſſion of people, but extended to all ſuch as experience an union and fellowſhip in ſpirit, wherein they are ſometimes lifted up to the father of ſpirits, and enabled to approach him "in ſpirit and in truth;" which has often been ſealed with the love and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of God, in a divine manifeſtation of his kindneſs and goodneſs to men, "who eat that which is good, and delight themſelves in fatneſs," being renewed in the ſpirit of their minds, and ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to lay hold on eternal life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="200" facs="unknown:037439_0217_100D44CD25FFFF30"/>In this communion, this unutterable, this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable communion, many have found their "ſtrength to be renewed," and their hearts to be engaged in the ſolemn worſhip of God, the author of their being: a communion inexpreſſible in its nature!—May thoſe minds, who have attained this happy experience, continue therein in all humility and purity!</p>
            <p>It is a communion in ſpirit, wherein the ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſoul approaches the author of ſpirits with a ſacrifice in ſpirit, when the ſacrifice of words ſhall fail. For there is a communion which language cannot expreſs! a worſhip that wants not the aid of words, nor is to be defined by an harmony of ſounds in which we approach the ſacred author of unutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able love.</p>
            <p>When there was "ſilence in heaven for about the ſpace of half an hour;" when the vocal tribute of "holy, holy, holy," and the hallelujahs of ſanctified ſpirits in endleſs felicity were ſuſpended, their worſhip continued in awful, holy, ſolemn, inconceivable SILENCE! it was rapturous adoration, too copious for language to expreſs! a cloud of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, before the throne of immaculate purity and love!—May our minds be gathered to it, let our name and profeſſion to religion be what it may! and
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:037439_0218_100D2F44470610B0"/>
may we experience this divine communion of ſaints, and deeply ponder God's unbounded love, in ſolemn ſilence! For there is no power of elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence can ſufficiently acknowledge the obligation and reverence we owe His infinite Majeſty, who fills heaven and earth with his glory and goodneſs! But let us look up unto him, and wait to be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for it;—for "they that wait upon the Lord ſhall renew their ſtrength;"—wherein we may experience a conſtant advancement from grace to grace, until we attain the glorious end propoſed by this lively animating ſalutation (which I wiſh for you as for myſelf). "The grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghoſt, be with you all, always." Amen.</p>

            <head>A DISCOURSE DELIVERED AT YORK, THE 30TH DAY OF THE SIXTH MONTH, 1769.</head>
            <p>WHEN that great and eminent inſtrument, the <note n="*" place="bottom">The apoſtle Paul.</note> apoſtle of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, had ſucceſsfully laboured in planting the chriſtian churches, he left a caution to thoſe amongſt whom he had laboured, which retains its force and validi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty throughout all the ages of the militant church; amongſt all people of all names, but in a particular manner, to thoſe who profeſs the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and a hope of ſalvation by him. Be not deceived (he proceeds further to evince the neceſſity of this caution) God is not mocked! ſuch as every man ſows, ſuch ſhall he reap: if he ſow

            <p>I have no ſort of doubt of this caution being from divine inſpiration, recorded as a laſting watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word to all that would run ſo as to obtain, and perſevere without fainting, to a peaceful and happy concluſion; and I apprehend it is not either unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, or out of the line of my preſent duty, to renew the caution to each individual within the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of my voice; inaſmuch as he that betrays and deceives, is now ranked under the character of a liar and murderer from the beginning <note n="†" place="bottom">John viii. 44.—</note>, exerciſing thoſe deſtructive offices upon the unguar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, unwatchful, and deceived mind: for even where the fountain of light and underſtanding hath been opened to a diſcovery of thoſe things eſſential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary to ſalvation, there he hath not been wanting to preſent himſelf, amongſt thoſe ſons of God <note n="‡" place="bottom">Job 1.6.</note>, the immediate production of his enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and enlivening power.

Felixes and the Gallios, who defer repentance to a convenient ſeaſon <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts xxiv. 25.—</note>, and that care for none of theſe things <note n="†" place="bottom">c. xviii. 17.—</note>, to ſhut up their minds againſt religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and religious impreſſions; and to bring them more and more into the liſt of thoſe fools who make a mock of ſin <note n="‡" place="bottom">Prov. xiv. 9.</note>, and are offending the God that made them; who live in this world without the fear of God before their eyes <note n="‖" place="bottom">Pſalm xxxvi. 1.</note>, or a reverence towards him; and theſe he endeavours to fortify in the paths of ſkepticiſm and infidelity; and to bring them under the influence of corruption.</p>
            <p>He has ſuggeſted, and been too ſucceſsful in the ſuggeſtion, that there is no ſuperior power to whom we are accountable, adapted to the deſires of ſome who would gladly have him diveſted of thoſe attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes which are painful to their view; and here the enemy has been too much ſuffered to prevail with ſome unhappy minds, to depart from the joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, lightſome, pleaſant and delightful paths of true chriſtianity and godlineſs, into the devious paths of error and deception: and to be ſuſtained in that unhappy ſtate, I confeſs appears to me, a compendium of miſery without hope, and without God in the world; but as it is productive of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent eaſe, they have loſt ſight of future happineſs; as it propoſes immediate gratification, and preſents

            <p>I would gladly hope there are not many, if there are any, of the number (within the audience of my voice) of thoſe fools, who have ſaid in their heart "There is no God;" that have ſo far ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves to be drawn into the power of decepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as to ſay or to think, or even imagine, that there is no firſt moving cauſe, no reſt for their feet, nor God, the Lord of all the world; but it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently the production of a deluſive ſpirit, who attempts to inſinuate a diſbelief in the reality of a divine exiſtence.

They proceed even ſo far as to acknowledge the circulation of the ſeaſons, the productions of the earth, with a variety of external parts of created nature, to proceed from the fixed appointment of infinite wiſdom, and are ſupported by an almighty hand; but yet are unwilling to admit the certainty of his immediate providence, care, and regard towards that conſtituent part, the human creation; which is of infinitely greater importance than thoſe tabernacles of clay which are but for a ſeaſon, and in the courſe of nature ceaſe to exiſt. This has been one of the effects of groſs deception, impoſed upon the underſtandings of mankind, and which an unwearied enemy has from age to age endeavoured to propagate upon the earth, thereby to withdraw the ſoul from the ſource of true happineſs, wherein it might be enabled to reſiſt every evil inſtigation, which may be laid to enſnare the unguarded mind.</p>

            <p>But there has been a loſs ſuſtained by all people, of all names and diſtinctions, to religion, who have endeavoured to intrench themſelves within an imaginary ſecurity, within the bounds of natural powers and natural religion, and the exerciſe of thoſe reaſoning faculties of their own minds: there has been reaſon fixed with the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and, the laws of nature maintained as a ſufficient guide in our religious duties.</p>
            <p>It is a partial leaning to our own underſtandings, thus to advocate our own cauſe from the reaſoning

earth, from under the power of deception, to diſcern the neceſſity of thus coming out of the arms of ſelf-love, ſelf-will, the partial approbation of deluded minds, whence many have been led into a perſuaſion of the ſufficiency of human reaſon; they would have more liberty than the ſtraight gate and narrow way will admit of; in this, "have me excuſed," has been the frequent language of many, and a cauſe of departing from the conſecrated paths of holineſs, and whereby many have deviated from a circumſcribed walking in the paths which lead to the beautiful realms of light, and to an inheritance with the family of God, whoſe infinite and unboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded love is diffuſed throughout every part of his triumphant church; and extended to his militant on earth, for he would ſtill beautify the place of his ſanctuary within the glorious realms of everlaſting day, "the habitation of his holineſs, and the city where his honour dwells."</p>
            <p>"Be not deceived."</p>
            <p>Let not the minds of any profeſſing the chriſtian name be deceived by the partial repreſentation of natural affection and natural choice, a love of eaſe, or the pleaſing proſpects of temporal enjoyments, for that which is born of the fleſh is fleſh, and is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial, there is a glory terreſtrial and a celeſtial glory, but the terreſtrial glory is apt to withdraw
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:037439_0227_100D44E388BE3090"/>
the incautious mind into a viſionary dependence upon earthly, and uncertain happineſs; which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives of a portion in the glory celeſtial. And there is made, in the proviſion of God, an ample ſufficiency for us completely to attain a right in the ſpiritual creation of his ſon on this ſide eternity; and by which we now can ſay, "The Lord is with me," becauſe he is at my right hand, therefore I ſhall not be moved.</p>
            <p>It is the ſufficiency we receive from his divine aid and aſſiſtance, whereby I am enabled to guide my ſteps conſiſtent with his holy will; let us then confeſs with the apoſtle, I know that in me, that is in my fleſh, dwelleth no good thing. We ought ever to acknowledge, O Lord, righteouſneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to thee, but unto us bluſhing and confuſion of face! — There is a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation from the loweſt order of animated creation; for as no man knows the things of a man, ſave the ſpirit of a man that is in him, ſo no man knows the things of God, but by the ſpirit of God. As the fruit cannot with any propriety be good from a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe root, by deviating from the bounds preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by the former of heaven and earth, continued throughout the ſuperior order of created beings, no more can we judge of divine matters by a mere knowledge derived from human power and the natural underſtanding faculties of our own
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:037439_0228_100D44E58ABBBDE0"/>
minds; but we muſt enter into that within the veil; and be cloathed with a ſuperior light and underſtanding, from that power which has brought life and immortality to light by the goſpel: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let no man deceive you, be ye not deceived; for ſuch as every man ſows, ſuch ſhall he reap.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is another ſpecies of deception, that it ſeems neceſſary to apprize and warn you of, who profeſs the religion of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, under the various names and diſtinct profeſſions we may make in the world, amongſt thoſe who lay too much ſtreſs upon their various profeſſions, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a belief of truth, by giving the bare aſſent of our judgment to the teſtimony of others; this has been a ſpecies of impoſition too much purſued and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon, whereby names have paſt for things, and a profeſſion to religion has paſt for religion itſelf; a rectitude of ſentiment has often been deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſufficient atonement for irregularity of life; but it is impoſſible for us to adopt a life of religion, and yet retain a life to the world, as the chriſtian religion, which is of the higheſt authority and dignity, enforces the irreconcilable contrariety of theſe natures; but it is poſſible to adopt a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon notion and in tradition, and yet be utter ſtrangers to the life of true chriſtianity. I know not ſcarce a greater inſtance of deception amongſt profeſſors of the chriſtian name, than with thoſe
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:037439_0229_100D2F46592A2B50"/>
who would contend for orthodoxy of ſyſtem, and ſtrenuouſly ſupport the ſuperior importance of their own opinions, which has often proved a means of ſtirring up hatred and perſecution one towards another, and that under the ſpecious pretext of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing "for Chriſt's ſake;" but it abundantly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers that all the powers of deception, hath ſurroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and fortified them in a dangerous ſecurity, which it is very difficult ever to be extricated from.</p>
            <p>But let no man deceive you, or be ye not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; what ſignifies a perſuaſion or aſſent to truth, if we live not a life conſiſtent with the purity and holineſs of its nature, and correſpondent with the precepts of the goſpel.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If the mind was properly engaged to purſue the genuine effects of the ſpirit of truth (a diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which ought ever to be prevalent and cultivated amongſt us) we ſhould then abundantly demonſtrate a being born not of corruption, but of the incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptable ſeed, through the word of God, which liveth and abideth in you for ever, whereby we are made partakers in the eſſential virtue of the chriſtian religion. It matters not to me by what name I am called, or however diſtinguiſhed amongſt men, if I am but admitted into a fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the church of the firſt born; the proviſion
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:037439_0230_100D44E8336516D8"/>
of God, for thoſe who are called by his ſpirit, that are influenced and guided in wiſdom, and finally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be received into glory.</p>
            <p>Under theſe two claſſes ſtands the bulk of the chriſtian world, and on theſe two natures depends the final deciſive ſentence of, Come ye bleſſed, or Depart ye curſed.</p>
            <p>To you that lay more ſtreſs upon human inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and orthodox ſyſtems; who hold a reverence for names, and for external appearances, be not deceived; inaſmuch as the ſpirit of true religion remains the ſame, under every name, it lives in every form, and is confined to none, being one in itſelf, unchangeable and powerful in its energy, ſanctifying the ſoul, and whereby the heart is made pure in the ſight of God; and then the fruits will be unto holineſs, and the end life everlaſting.</p>
            <p>But there has been a lamentable deception pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent over the minds of many, who are dead to religion and religious impreſſions: theſe would acknowledge and aſſent with the tongue, though perhaps their judgment proceeded no farther than from the reaſoning faculties of their own minds, without regard to the powerful motives contained an that excellent deſcription of chriſtianity, or the efficacious tendency of it, With the heart man
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:037439_0231_100D44E9D06AF8F0"/>
believeth unto righteouſneſs, and with the tongue, confeſſion is made unto ſalvation; for where a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the mouth is made, there is great need for a concurrence with the heart, from a feeling ſenſe of the powerful principle and life of religion in the ſoul.</p>
            <p>"Be not deceived."</p>
            <p>There is another ſort of people under all names and diſtinctions of religion, to whom alſo this cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeems exceedingly neceſſary, and amongſt whom the precepts of the goſpel have loſt their force; theſe would imagine that the way to the kingdom of God is varied from that preſcribed by the holy author of the chriſtian faith. It is a ſtrait and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row way; they would plead no poſſibility of living up to truth, but purſue the general practice of mankind; and plead that, as truth itſelf is loſt, it muſt now be fetched from the land of general prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and the general conduct of themſelves and others: but God is unchangeable in his nature, and his relative attributes remain the ſame throughout every diſpenſation of the world, and the foundation of God ſtandeth independent of all deficiency (in whom is no variableneſs or ſhadow of turning) of all the deceivable inventions of ſuch ſons of formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and deceived ſouls in all ages, that have been unwilling to ſubmit to the inflexible law of the
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:037439_0232_100D44EC812BED40"/>
ſpirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus; theſe would endeavour to acquit themſelves with the more flexible law of general practice, and general conduct; varied ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their inclinations, indulging every ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality, and ſpending their time in the purſuit of earthly pleaſures. Theſe would build their expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations upon the merciful attributes of that being whom they offend: and neglect to conſider that a time will come, when juſtice as well as mercy, will be recompenſed to every man according to his deeds, whether they be good or evil.</p>
            <p>It is an endleſs commandment, and can never be abrogated; That the ſoul that ſins ſhall die, and remains over the heads of all mankind who yield themſelves to preſent pleaſures, and give up their minds to follow after lying vanities; who, nevertheleſs would have a portion in the unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enjoyment of an endleſs futurity, and an admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on within the conſecrated manſions of eternal glory; but I would caution theſe not to be deceived, for God is not mocked, and we ſhall certainly find it ſo when every human aid, with the powers of deception, ſhall diſappear; it will prove a fatal witneſs againſt all the pleaſing expectations of a deluded hope.</p>
            <p>But ſuch is the progreſs of the work of that liar and murderer, to introduce a concurrence of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:037439_0233_100D44EF6079A110"/>
with diſagreement into the affairs of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; that ſome have imagined he looks not with that vigilence towards the work of his hand, which revealed religion teaches us to expect from the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful effects of his divine notice and regard, whoſe mercy is great, or elſe we ſhould not be able to ſtand before him; but he is righteous as well as merciful, in all his ways, and will by no means ſuffer uncleanneſs to enter his holy habitation, but will haſten the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of guilt upon the impenitent ſoul; and thoſe who obdurately proceed in a courſe of deviati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from their morning light, whereby they loſe the capacity of diſtinguiſhing betwixt light and darkneſs, or the diſagreement of happineſs and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery. Theſe notwithſtanding would gladly look at the glorious light of heaven, and hope at large for an admiſſion into the ſacred manſions of everlaſting day; but the purity of his nature will admit no uncleanneſs to enter his kingdom: all thoſe attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of God, of juſtice as well as mercy, remain immoveable, and fixed in the righteous appointment of unerring wiſdom; and therefore let no obſtacle hinder our approaches before the throne of his holineſs, to render every attribute of praiſe to Him whoſe infinite and adorable perfections, are emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently manifeſted in the uniform and glorious eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of his ſacred church and family: therefore be not deceived by any of the powers of darkneſs, or led to rely upon the ſtrength of external per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances,
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:037439_0234_100D44F15C4FB9F8"/>
what is called divine ſervice, or the frequent performance of religious duties, ſo called; all theſe, when under a proper government and in ſeaſon, proceeding from a proportion of grace and ſtrength given, are profitable and we become engaged to join in that univerſal ſong of praiſe ariſing from every heart, of the ſpiritual creation of God.</p>
            <p>But when the minds of any become diveſted of this animating qualification, by which alone we are enabled to approach the Father of Spirits in ſpirit and in truth, our dependence upon exterior per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances will only prove a witneſs againſt us, and be ranked among the catalogue of our ſins, in the day when the ſecrets of every heart ſhall be divul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and a righteous recompence is given to each: therefore be not deceived by a ſeeming ſanctity, or the frequent performance of religious duties ſo called, without a co-operation with the object of faith and practice, and a mental aſſent to the force of thoſe truths moſt ſurely believed and received among us; for it is from the inward frame and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of our own minds in which alone an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable ſacrifice can be offered to the author of our being.</p>
            <p>"Be not deceived."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="218" facs="unknown:037439_0235_100D44F2E6CC24E8"/>I would, in a few more expreſſions, endeavour to aſſert the power of God unto ſalvation.</p>
            <p>"God is not mocked,"—we may; and it is to be feared, ſometimes do mock ourſelves, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon riches, and the deluſive proſpects of earthly pleaſures,—by external appearances, by the falſe traffic of unfelt truths; with a name to religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and a reſemblance to truth. But it is impoſſible to mock God; he is not mocked by the moſt ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous appearances of regular pretenſions; we can never impoſe upon the ſagacity of that infinite eye which penetrates the moſt ſecret receſſes of the human heart. Our moſt ſecret thoughts are ever expoſed to his omniſcient view—God is not mocked.</p>
            <p>Let us beware leſt we mock ourſelves, by delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive appearances of tranſient happineſs, and a peace ſhort of that peace of God which paſſeth the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings of men; for, "the foundation of God ſtandeth ſure, having this ſeal, The Lord knoweth who are his—and let all thoſe that call upon the name of Chriſt depart from iniquity <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Tim. ii. 9.</note>."</p>
            <p>Such as every man ſows, ſuch ſhall he reap. If his conduct is correſpondent with the ſpirit of the world, if his demeanor and walking be after the rule of the fleſh, "of the fleſh he ſhall reap
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:037439_0236_100D44F473229B50"/>
corruption," from that miſerable crop. "To be carnally minded is death;"—a death to religion, and an alienation from the light of his countenance: "but to he ſpiritually minded is life and peace."— "The carnal mind is not ſubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be;" being ever at contrariety, in its own nature, to that purity and holineſs, the requiſite effects of genuine chriſtianity, diffuſed throughout every part of his ſanctified church and family.</p>
            <p>I would therefore recommend to each individual within the audience of my voice, let their name and profeſſion of religion be what they may, ſeriouſly to weigh the importance of theſe conſiderations, and to make theſe momentous inquiries,—What am I ſowing to? What ſpirit is predominant? Under what power do I live? In what ſervice am I engaged? Do I properly regard the aſſertion of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt—"He that loves any thing more than me is not worthy of me." If I am ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the fleſh I am in a ſtate of deception, moved and turned from my purpoſe of being; I have met with ſomething more amiable and engaging, and better adapted to my natural inclination than the love of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And, finally, to you of all names and diſtinctions of religion, whatſoever degree of temporal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:037439_0237_100D44F6064529E0"/>
whatſoever advantages any may derive from the praiſe of the world, or the profeſſion of tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent glory, any ſoul may poſſibly enjoy, in the eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of mankind. The righteous God has fixed, as an invariable deciſion,—that if you ſow to the fleſh, you ſhall of the fleſh reap corruption, but, if you ſow to the ſpirit,—however painful, however exerciſed, or deſpiſed, ſecretly ſurrounded with diſtreſs and anxiety, within and without, mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lamentation and woe, trodden under foot or deſpiſed amongſt men; under whatever difficulties we may have to paſs, however mournful or painful our allotment in life may be, lift up thy head in hope—for, if we ſow to the ſpirit, of the ſpirit we ſhall finally reap the glorious crop of life everlaſting.</p>

            <head>THE FOLLOWING HEADS OF A DISCOURSE WAS DELIVERED AT HORSLEYDOWN MEETING, UPON THE CLOSE OF A VISIT TO FRIENDS FAMI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIES IN THAT QUARTER, THE 19TH OF THE ELEVENTH MONTH, 1769.</head>
            <p>A SOLEMN ſummons which the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty gave through his Prophet Joel, to a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whom he had known above all the families of the earth, (at a time when they had revolted and departed in heart from him) has been revived in my mind; with an apprehenſion that the ſame authority requires the republication of it in this day, to a people likewiſe highly favoured of him; and who have in like manner departed from their firſt love.</p>
            <p>"Blow the Trumpet in Zion—ſanctify a faſt— call a ſolemn aſſembly—gather the people—ſanctify the congregation—aſſemble the elders—gather the children and thoſe that ſuck the breaſt—let the bride-groom go forth of his chamber, and the

            <p>As I am about to conclude (perhaps finally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude) my labours amongſt you in this quarter; I would query with ſome, with many that are preſent, whether they have not heard intelligibly the ſound of the trumpet, calling them with a degree of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, to ariſe and prepare themſelves for the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. My brethren and ſiſters, amongſt whom I have been conſtrained in the overflowings of the Father's love, to labour in a private capacity, breaking (I hope I may ſay) a little bread from houſe to houſe—the everlaſting Goſpel has been preached amongſt you with all the force of pathetic energy, with all the tenderneſs of divine compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; let it not be ineffectual! The Goſpel meſſage has been delivered with ſuch indubitable clearneſs, that your judgments have been convinced, you have aſſented to "the truth as it is in Jeſus <note n="†" place="bottom">Epheſians iv. 21.</note>:" ſuffer not the impreſſions it has made on your minds to be ſpeedily erafed. Far, very far, be it from
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:037439_0240_100D44FE0CFC2860"/>
me to think highly of myſelf, to exalt the officer, the miniſter. I would not that you ſhould hold any Man's perſon in high eſtimation. I am deeply ſenſible that to me belongs "bluſhing and confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of face," but I magnify mine office, and the power of him who has ſeen meet to employ me therein; I would endeavour to exalt in our view the adorable goodneſs and condeſcenſion of the great author of all mercies, in that he has cauſed the trumpet to be renewedly founded in your bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; hear its important meſſage with ſuitable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; let it rouſe and prepare all the ranks in the armies of our Iſrael, to engage in the glorious cauſe of our God. Let the daughter of our Zion ariſe from the bed of Indolence; from the lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gic ſtupor of a fatal forgetfulneſs; from all the deadning, benumbing gratifications of ſenſuality, and ſhake herſelf from the duſt of the earth, that ſhe may come up to the help of him who hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her with an high and holy calling. The trumpet is blown in her ſtreets, the alarm has been heard by all, Oh! let not its language be rendered unintelligible by the multiplicity of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial things that too much abſorb the minds of many.</p>
            <p>I am fully perſuaded that the gracious viſitation of humbling melting goodneſs, has been afreſh extended to individuals preſent, in (I had almoſt
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:037439_0241_100D45000ADA2320"/>
ſaid) a very memorable manner; nor will I recall the expreſſion, for if it is not treaſured up in your remembrance now, for your profit and advantage, it will be memorable in that awful approaching period, when every neglected mercy will appear deeply engraven, as a dread "hand-writing on the wall <note n="*" place="bottom">Dan. v. 5.</note>," againſt us. Let me, therefore, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly intreat you, with all the warmth of unut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable affection, as a brother, as a fellow pilgrim, through the viciſſitudes of time to the unmixed joys of a happy eternity, that you will no longer neglect the offers of mercy, or turn a deaf ear to the reproofs of Inſtruction. I feel my mind covered with that boundleſs Love, that wiſhes, that ardently deſires, you may indeed be wiſe for yourſelves: For although I may be deficient in many qualifications of a goſpel miniſter, I am not wanting in that pure diſintereſted love, which ſeeks not yours but you. "Blow the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet in Zion; ſanctify a faſt." If we were but enough attentive to the ſound of the trumpet, we ſhould ſee the abſolute neceſſity of this ſanctified faſt; a faſt from every of thoſe deluſive pleaſures, thoſe ſlaviſh attachments, that render the mind inſenſible of Good. "Call a ſolemn aſſembly." This branch of the ſummons (may ſome ſay) belongs only to a few, and we have no ſhare in the duty it enjoins. I confeſs I am of another
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:037439_0242_100D4502300A9968"/>
opinion; I think every individual has a ſhare in the inſtruction couched in it. "Call a ſolemn Aſſembly." Oh! you active ones, ſtop a while in your ſwift career; make a ſolemn pauſe: ſtand collected from every object that can gratify or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light the ſenſual part; labour diligently to aſſemble all the powers and faculties of your Souls, that they may be ſanctified by him who gave them. I believe there is no uſeleſs, dead, unactive mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in the Church of God; and thoſe that can thus aſſemble the collected attention of a redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mind, devoted to the divine will, have an undoubted right from the higheſt Authority to call an holy convocation. "We can do nothing againſt the truth, but for the truth <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Cor. xiii 8.</note>," was the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of ſome formerly, who had indeed ſanctified an acceptable faſt. I much deſire that thoſe who perhaps cannot be ſo active in promoting this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious cauſe amongſt the ſons of men, as ſome who are called into more eminent ſtations in the church, may by a circumſpect care over all their words and actions, ſee that they do nothing againſt the truth. "Call a ſolemn aſſembly; gather the people." How ſcattered are many of the members of this Quarter! ſcattered indeed as ſheep with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſhepherd! diſperſed up and down in the dark vale of inſenſibility and ſelf-forgetfulneſs!
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:037439_0243_100D4504723C7940"/>
many upon the barren mountains of an empty profeſſion; loſt to all ſenſe of religious fellowſhip; unacquainted with that holy union in which is the bond of Peace! How many are the Gallios I have met with amongſt you, who (alas! it may be ſaid) care for none of theſe things! Oh you Elders! who are or might have been as Pillars in the Lord's Houſe; you delegated Shepherds, who might have adorned the firſt ranks in the armies of our Iſrael, if you had not ſat down and taken up a reſt ſhort of thoſe glorious abodes, which are prepared for them that ſteadily perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in the line of divine appointment—to you the call is, "gather the people."</p>
            <p>"Am I my brothers keeper <note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. iv. 9.</note>!" let it ſuffice for me that I look to myſelf, and that my own fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is in tolerable order, is a language that too much prevails. But Oh! that you had the cauſe of God more at heart; that you were more engaged to gather the people; that you might with a Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly care, overlook thoſe whoſe minds to preſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the barren deſart, the uncultivated wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; that you might comfort and encourage them that tread the gloomy ſcenes of an adverſe allotment, as it were cut of from every joy, and alive to each painful ſenſibility; how would it comfort many of theſe, if an experienced friend
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:037439_0244_100D45063996F738"/>
was now and then to drop into their families, and at times ſpeak a word, in the opening of divine wiſdom, ſuitable to their ſeveral ſtates; I believe it would be a great means of gathering the people. Why ſhould your care be circumſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed within the narrow limits of your own fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies (altho' they ſhould certainly be well regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated) but you might be more extenſively ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, if thus engaged in the care of the Houſhold of God. I am perſuaded that the divine wing would be over you, and that a bleſſing would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend your labours. It is not a time for us to dwell unconcerned in our ceiled houſes, when the houſe of God lies waſte. We have, many of us, the ſame tender connexions as you; I my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf have the ſame endearing attachments as ſome of you, the ſame ties of domeſtic love, and perhaps as deeply ſenſible of all their force, as ſome of you; not leſs attentive to every relative and ſocial duty, than ſome of you; my Nature is not harſh, my principles much leſs ſo; yet I am made willing to leave all, to come and labour with you; if ſo be I might be inſtrumental to rouſe any to a more arduous purſuit of their everlaſting intereſt; and I can freely acknowledge, with humble thankfulneſs, that I never more fully experienced my peace to flow as a river; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver could with greater joy ſay "Return Oh! my

ſoul to the place of thy reſt, for the Lord thy God hath dealt bountifully with thee <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſalm cxvi. 7.—</note>," then when I have been thus engaged in extenſive pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate labours; viſiting the ſick; reviving the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful: encouraging the diſconſolate; ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening the weak; watching over and carefully admoniſhing the giddy incautious youth; and I doubt not but you would have the reward of peace in your own boſoms, if as heads of the ſociety you were more often thus employed in endeavouring to "gather the people."</p>
            <p>"Sanctify the congregation; aſſemble the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders." I have been deeply concerned to ſee ſome of the elders ſo deficient in filling the line of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine appointment. If they were more frequently engaged to aſſemble under the holy influence of that power in which they ſhould move, they would many of them be commanded to "blow the trumpet in Zion; but I know of no ſtate harder to ſpeak to or more difficult to reach, than that of an elder whoſe mind is overgrown by the earthly nature; "Oh! earth, earth, earth! hear the word of the Lord <note n="†" place="bottom">Jer. xxii. 20.</note>." I don't recollect any other inſtance in ſacred writ, where attention is demanded in a ſimilar manner; "Oh! earth, earth, earth!" thus thrice repeated, plainly ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the great difficulty there is in reaching to
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:037439_0246_100D450BEF3F46A0"/>
thoſe, who are as it were buried in the earth, whoſe minds are fixt in it.</p>
            <p>"Gather the children." You that have the riſing youth under your care, let me call upon you, let me intreat you to "gather the children;" gather them from all the bewitching enticing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements of the world, gather their attention to that of God in their own minds. Oh! how have I ſecretly mourned to ſee the poor children ſo ſorrowfully neglected; ſo uninſtructed; ſo much eſtranged to that holy divine principle, which would ſo exceedingly beautify and enrich them: but alas! how few parents are rightly qualified to teach their children the law of divine love; to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill into their tender minds proper ſentiments, to cultivate upon them thoſe impreſſions that would be of everlaſting advantage; and if the Children, when the gracious viſitation of the Father of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies moves upon their hearts, warming and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating them with the love of virtue, raiſing the ſecret ſigh, and begetting deſires after heaven and holineſs; I ſay if the children ſhould then aſk the negligent parent; "What is the ſecret ſomething I which I feel? this principle which impreſſes my mind with the love of virtue? what is it? what value ſhall I ſet upon it?" How then can you give them ſuitable inſtruction? you cannot teach them obedience to its ſacred dictates, when your
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:037439_0247_100D450EF2EFB410"/>
own example ſpeaks a language quite oppoſite: Oh! why ſhould the Sea Monſter be brought againſt you. "The Sea Monſter draweth forth the breaſt to her young, but the daughter of my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is become cruel, like the Oſtrich in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that leaveth her eggs in the ſand to be hatched by the beams of the ſun, and conſidereth not that the foot of the paſſenger may cruſh them <note n="*" place="bottom">Lament. iv. 3.—Job xxx 14.15.</note>!"—the daughter of my people hath left her tender off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring to the uncertainty of being accidentally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefited, or I ſhould rather ſay, to the mercy of God, unaſked, unſought, expoſed to all the dangers of a dreary wilderneſs, unaided unaſſiſted by the care of a natural parent! The tongue of the ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing child cleaveth to the roof of its mouth for thirſt! the Children aſk bread and there is none in many families to break it; they want to be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed by the ſincere milk of the word, but alas! "the daughter of my people is become cruel!" Oh! you parents, you delegated Shepherds, what account will you have to render when the Lord of the whole earth ariſeth to make inquiſition for blood!</p>
            <p>Bear with me my beloved friends; flattery and ſmooth tales may pleaſe Fools, but they will not pleaſe him whom I deſire to ſerve in the Goſpel of his Son. All that is within me is moved, while I

thus earneſtly expoſtulate with you on behalf of the dear children; ſuffer me to intreat you, for God's ſake, for your own ſoul's ſake, for the ſake of the cauſe of truth, gather the children and thoſe that ſuck the breaſt;" thoſe that are filling themſelves with the world's conſolation, with the intoxicating pleaſures and amuſements of a degen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erate age; wean them from theſe delights; gather them to the knowledge of themſelves, to a ſenſe of the mercies that are offered them by the great Author of Mercies ancient and new. "While thy ſervant was buſied hither and thither the man made his eſcape <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Kings xx. 40.—</note>," was the vain excuſe of the officer to whoſe cuſtody a certain captive was committed with this charge, "take care of this man till I come, and if thou let him go, thy life ſhall go for his life. <note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. xx. 39.</note>." No plea of other engagements, nor even the want of ability to diſcharge our duty towards our offspring will ſtand us in any ſtead; if, when the almighty queries with us "What haſt thou done with thoſe Lambs I left under thy care in the wilderneſs, thoſe tender offspring I gave thee in charge!" we have through neglect, through unwatchfulneſs ſuffered him or her to go, but we ſhall moſt certainly, ſtand accountable for his or her life, I ſaid want of ability, becauſe I aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe, that want of ability will be ſo far from a palliation of the crime, that it will rather increaſe
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:037439_0249_100D4512D46F3B50"/>
our condemnation; can we plead want of ability to him who is always ready to furniſh us with it, if we are but willing to receive it at his hand.</p>
            <p>I am of opinion reſpecting many of our youth, that if they had been properly inſtructed, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully watched over, if they could have ſeen the beauty of holineſs ſhine in the example of their parents, they would not have gone out ſo widely as they have. Oh! you parents of both ſexes, an important truſt is repoſed in you; example your children in the practice of piety; example ſpeaks louder, much louder, than precept; its influence is far more extenſive. And while on the one hand you are excited to a faithful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of your duty towards them, by the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain hope of a glorious reward; ſo on the other hand, the powerful ties of natural affection, the warm ſolicitude for the happineſs of thoſe you love, muſt ſtir up to diligence in the work and ſervice appointed you.</p>
            <p>"Gather the children." If after your atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive care has been employed, for their preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; if after by the forceable voice of example, you have called them to the perfecting of holineſs in the fear of God, they will go, they will turn aſide into the by-ways and crooked paths of ſin and iniquity, they muſt ſtand by their own choice;
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:037439_0250_100D4514EABFF458"/>
you have redeemed your ſouls, and will be found in your lots at the end of time, a ponderous crown awaits you, you will cloſe your eyes, and open them to the boundleſs fruition of unmixt joy, in a happy eternity.</p>
            <p>We do ſometimes with ſorrow obſerve, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied labours of a parent's love, beſtowed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the deſired effect; 'tis mournful to ſee chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren pierce with bitterneſs and anxiety the breaſt that has been their ſupport in their infantile years; to fill that eye with ſorrow, that has dropt over them the tear of maternal fondneſs; 'tis a cruel thing for a child to mingle gall and wormwood, in the cup of a parent deſcending to the grave; let us be aſſured that their own portion of gall and and wormwood will be doubly increaſed thereby, in the ſolemn hour of juſt retribution! But, Oh beloved youth! I earneſtly deſire that you may never thus widely deviate from the paths of recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; 'tis on you the hope of the preſent age muſt ſhortly devolve; may you wiſely chooſe an early ſubmiſſion to the holy diſcipline of the croſs of Chriſt, that you may come up as an army for God. Conſider the uncertainty of your ſtay here; conſider the important buſineſs of life; and let the love of every unprofitable delight be ſwallowed up in the arduous purſuit of glory, honour, immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality and eternal life. We are daily inſtructed by
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:037439_0251_100D4516F1454418"/>
the powerful eloquent language of mortality; Death invades all ranks, ſnatches thoſe of all ages from the buſy ſtage of life, ſhe that was yeſterday ſurrounded with nuptial joys, muſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow be confined within the cold incloſure of the ſilent grave. "Let the Bridegroom go ſorth of his chamber, and the bride out of her cloſet;" let the young, the joyous, thoſe that are in the bloom of life, leave every thing that tends to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard their progreſs towards the city of the ſaints ſolemnity; let them relinquiſh their moſt exalted ſatisfactions, rather than neglect to lay hold on the joys of God's ſalvation; which are unuttera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly more deſirable, than all the ſin-pleaſing grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications that this world can beſtow.</p>
            <p>"Let the prieſts, the miniſters of the Lord weep between the porch and the altar;" this ſhould not be confined to thoſe only whoſe mouths may be opened publickly amongſt you, for it be longs to all thoſe who preach to others by the regularity of a Godly life and converſation: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we are favoured with a living miniſtry of divine appointment, who dare not fill the ears of men with a repetition of unfelt truth's, nor amuſe them with the unprofitable productions of an empty mind, but are concerned to diſcharge themſelves

If we are thus unitedly engaged on behalf of our Iſrael it may be that the Lord will again "be jealous over his land" with an holy jealouſy, for I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think that a people whom he has raiſed by his own invincible power, and ſo ſignally placed his name amongſt, were ever deſigned to be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the tranſient glory of a couple of centuries; I am ſtill revived by a ſecret hope of better times, when our Zion ſhall again put on her beautiful garments; and in her, and with her, ſhall ariſe judges as at the firſt, and counſellors and lawgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers as at the beginning; let us weep between the porch and the altar: let us intercede for the people that the land may yet be ſpared! the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ear of our heavenly father is ſtill open to the ſupplications of his children, and I believe he will yet "be jealous over his land and pity his

The time approaches when the great daſher in pieces will more and more come up amongſt us, and may all who are broken by him, wait to be healed by the ariſing of his love; I ſhall not live to ſee it, but I live in the faith, and I believe I ſhall die in the faith, that the Lord of Hoſts will yet beautify the place of his feet, that our "Zion will yet become an eternal exellency, and Jeruſalem the praiſe of the whole earth <note n="‡" place="bottom">Hoſea xi. 8.</note>!"</p>
            <p>Let us weep between the porch and the altar with unwearied interceſſion, for "the Lord will yet be jealous over his land and pity his people." The bowels of adorable compaſſion yet yearn over his children, with all the tenderneſs of a Father's Love, "How ſhall I give thee up O Ephraim? How ſhall I make thee as Admah and ſet thee as Zeboim <note n="†" place="bottom">Iſaiah lx. 15. lxii. 7.</note>?" How ſhall I cut thee off from being a people before me? by this moving and pathetic language would the Great Father of the Univerſe induce you to return to the arms of everlaſting mercy! And if we who are placed as watchmen in Zion faithfully diſcharge the truſt repoſed in us, we ſhall be made inſtrumental in gathering the ſcattered and diſperſed ſheep, from the eaſt and from the weſt, from the north and from the ſouth,

            <head>A DISCOURSE DELIVERED AT BRADFORD, THE 17TH DAY OF THE EIGHTH MONTH, 1770.</head>
            <p>ALTHOUGH there is (unhappily for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) a ſpirit of diſſipation and incredulity, with reſpect to matters of the higheſt importance, too viſibly prevalent in many minds; yet it is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and comfortable to me to have reaſon to believe, that in many others an enquiry is raiſed after the way to life and ſalvation.</p>
            <p>"O Lord, who ſhall ſhew us any good."</p>
            <p>An enquiry worthy of being inculcated and adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſincerity and impartiality; and I have no doubt of its being crowned with the deſired ſucceſs to every honeſt and ſincere queriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="239" facs="unknown:037439_0256_100D45208C48E9A8"/>I think the day in which we live, through the awakening virtue of divine mercy, furniſhes many inſtances or ſubjects like this which the Evangelical Prophet applied to, with the gracious invitation of the author and well ſpring of all that is good, an invitation which has ſometimes warm'd me, and is affectionately raiſed in my heart towards this aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</p>
            <p>"Ho, every one that thirſteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money, come ye buy and eat, yea come, buy wine and milk without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and without price. Wherefore do ye ſpend your money for that which is not bread, and your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for that which ſatisfieth not: hearken dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently unto me, and eat that which is good, and let your ſoul delight itſelf in fatneſs."</p>
            <p>This is an invitation which may have little mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or ſignificancy in it, to thoſe minds who are ſtrangers (unhappily ſtrangers) to the beginning of the ſpiritual creation of God, as forming and faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning itſelf, in holineſs unto glory; but it is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, and intelligible, to ſuch minds as have been happily deſirous of knowledge of him in whom they have profeſſed to believe, and meaſurably witneſſed the entrance of that ſpirit as both light and life, which is juſtly and pertinently called the "Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening Spirit," for it is by the influence, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livening
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:037439_0257_100D4523C91F7EB8"/>
of this quickening ſpirit, we muſt be made (if we ever are made) living ſouls to God, initiated into, and built up in that life which is eternally happy.</p>
            <p>We are incapable of either hunger or thirſt, but through the enlivening of this quickening ſpirit. hunger and thirſt are acts appertaining to life. The dead have not thoſe ſenſations, who are naturally or ſpiritually dead. It was by the efficacious work of that holy "wind that bloweth where it liſteth," that the dead dry bones were drawn into a divine reſemblance, in the former ſtate of mankind, and whereby they were brought together, and united to their reſpective places in the heavenly body, quickened, raiſed, formed a living army to God: but it was an utter impoſſibility for any power ſhort of that "Creating divine power," to bring together thoſe dead dry bones: and indeed the ſimilitude, I confeſs, ſeems worthy of that wiſdom that deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered it. They were human bones, there was a degree of fitneſs in their form and conſtruction; for memberſhip and for aſſimilating one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but I conceive that notwithſtanding this inher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent virtue or ability in the dead dry bones to aſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late one with another, they had certainly lain till the conſummation of all things, but for that ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural breath or wind of divine power which raiſed them unto life. And I freely own that I believe
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:037439_0258_100D45268DFC1FB8"/>
ſomething of this nature hath attended the minds of many in thoſe days in which we live, that would be to them as the Quickening Spirit, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal object in the rudiments of a divine life, and enable us to live in the obedience of an holy faith here, and to be raiſed to the enjoyment of endleſs good hereafter. This is what I wiſh for all thoſe, who are on their way to an holy habitation, where the wicked ceaſe from troubling, and the weary ſoul enjoys eternal reſt.</p>
            <p>And, as having received mercy and a degree of merciful experience from the author of my being, I find ſome engagement to point out ſome ſteps which have produced the firſt fruits of the ſpiritual creation of God, and what hath been the means of debilitating ſome in their race, or turning aſide others from following the works of an unavailing profeſſion.</p>
            <p>For, as I have ſaid, I have no doubt that the preſent awakening upon many minds is of a divine nature: and it may be known whence it proceeds, its original may be traced by thus conſidering whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it more abounds in heavenly deſires, or in deſires after the things of this life.</p>
            <p>In the myſtery of ungodlineſs there is a life that imitates the life of Chriſt, but it is a life that muſt
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:037439_0259_100D45281C9571A0"/>
die if ever we live acceptably to God. It is a life reſulting from ſelf love and a love of this world, wherein the prince of the powers of the air bears rule in the children of diſobedience, that preſents its ſimilitude and deſires after heaven.</p>
            <p>Let me die the death of the righteous. Let me flee from the wrath to come: Let me have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance in the kingdom of peace, world without end: This is a language uttered by many, though perhaps they continue in the gratification of corrupt nature, and conſequently have no part in that life, that incorruptable, undefiled life, which alone can obtain an inheritance in the kingdom of God. Fleſh and blood cannot inherit this kingdom and its life. Theſe deſires, theſe wiſhes after a ſtate of happineſs, and deſires after heaven, have frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in many minds, proceeded from vitiated cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted ſelf, having built up a viſionary hope, and hence they have eſtimated its ſucceſs, according to the warmth of deſire after life, and a life in that "fleſh and blood which cannot inherit the kingdom of God."</p>
            <p>I am very apprehenſive too many have miſtaken this ardor of mind for the production of good, the kingdom of God, though in an unſanctified, uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted ſtate, and, in the warmth and ſervour of this fire they have kindled, the kingdom of heaven
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:037439_0260_100D4529A95A6D00"/>
hath ſuffered a kind of violence; in this miſtaken ſtate, wherein too many have endangered their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and eternal happineſs; and in their ſpiritual race involved themſelves in this moſt dangerous miſtake, by how much the more we may approach a reſemblance to religion, and are not in it; being amuſed with an imitation of divine life, and at the ſame time not actuated by it. This is to conſtitute the danger under which we live, to entertain deſires after heaven, when not poſſeſſed of heavenly virtue.</p>
            <p>"Let me be holy; let me die the death deſtin'd for me to die."</p>
            <p>Thus heavenly deſires take in the means as well as the end; "O Lord, prepare me for thy king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom," let not thy hand ſpare, nor thine eye pity, till judgment paſs upon the Mount of Edom, Eſau's firſt production; turn thy hand upon me, purge away all my droſs, take away all my ſin, and refine as the reprobate ſilver.</p>
            <p>As our deſires are thus raiſed after the fountain of divine life, the glorious and holy Quickener will ever draw to a ſimilitude to its author; and deſires after heaven, not merely for its ſafety but for its purity, not merely as a place of exemption from pain, anxiety and ſorrow, but as the habitation of
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:037439_0261_100D452C18A806E8"/>
ſanctified and holy ſpirits. Now this is to bring re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and religious labour where it ought to exiſt, from the viſion of the head to the feeling emotions of the heart; it lays the axe to the root of every ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial branch. The axe is laid to the root of the tree, and even tree that bringeth forth not good fruit is hewn down and caſt into the fire; and the virtue of this divine invitation is diffuſed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed througout all the powers of the ſoul.</p>
            <p>"Ho, every one that thirſteth," in whom this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine life has ariſen, that take in the glorious object, not only its end but the means that can lift up the heart with the hands to God in the heavens, in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſupplication, that he may refine, ſanctify, and purge away their ſins; that he may waſh them from all impurity, and by the aſſimilating virtue of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace, be reſtored to an union with the Holy Spirit. Theſe are then enabled to ſerve him in the beauty of holineſs and the newneſs of life.</p>
            <p>"Ho, every one that thirſteth," every one in whom a thirſt has been raiſed, and in whom a thirſt has ariſen, after the animating virtue of the Quik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening Spirit, may you continue in an awful reverent ſenſe of that goodneſs and mercy, that has thus viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you, and cauſed a ſenſe of the want of that food, wherewith Chriſt feeds his flock, to take place in your hearts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="245" facs="unknown:037439_0262_100D452F7B300210"/>There are ſome people quite too high for religion; alas! ſome others think themſelves too low for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, in whom an anxious ſolicitude is become depreſſed with fear, and who are on the verge of deſpair, not ſufficiently conſidering the efficacious virtue of that power that would ſanctify, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare, in affliction, for future glory and happineſs. Some are ready to lament their ſituation, and to adopt theſe mournful enquiries: <q>What have I to do with religion?—Will God accept the labour of my hands for the manſions of light and life?—I would endeavour with diligence to fill up the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of my day; I would ſeek the conſolation of my God, but it is forever hid from me.</q> This has often been the language inſinuated by the grand deceiver and enemy of mankind's happineſs; for though our heavenly Father that cloaths the ſeaſons with variety, may diverſify the day with affliction, he would yet draw us near to himſelf; and know, for thy encouragement, there is abundant acceſs, through the one glorious Mediator, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom we are admitted into that within the veil; his ears are open to our requeſts, as to the cherubin and ſeraphin with their holy, holy, holy, in the habitation of light and bliſs. He is the God and Father of us all, he that is their God, he is my God, he is thy God, thy Father, and thy Friend, from whom this proclamation of unbounded mercy is gone forth. "Ho, every one that thirſteth," every one in this divine life is raiſed, come ye to
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:037439_0263_100D45310EE625E0"/>
the waters, and he that hath no money come, buy and eat, buy wine and milk without money and without price."</p>
            <p>As it is of divine original this life proceeds from, ſo it muſt be ſomething adequate to its own nature that can ſatisfy it, and an hunger after it, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the God of life, and a diffuſion of his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and it is in the holy animating virtue of it we cry, Abba, Father! to Him that dwells in glory.</p>
            <p>This is the divine life:—It is a life that will be ſtrength to the feeble, and refreſh the thirſty ſoul. This is the life that is properly called religion, and ever ſubſiſts in the kingdom of the Almighty God, and Father of heaven and earth, and throughout the ſpiritual creation of his Son:—It is the ſame life that breaths to man in ſecret ſorrow and complaint—it is in the fullneſs of the ſame that the loftieſt oblation of worſhip aſcends to God on high, from all who are virtually united to his ſanctified church, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, both in heaven and earth. We may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by various names, or different modes, with regard to circumſtantial points, but it is the animating life of Chriſt that lives through all form, and is one both in heaven and earth. It leads to it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to thirſt after itſelf, conſiſtent with its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. It has ſeen an end of all perfection in imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary views of things, through the divine command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God.</p>

            <p>It is a life that cannot be ſatisfied with any thing that this world can afford, neither can it be content with the moſt ſpecious profeſſions of truth; it cannot be content with all the riches of a name, nor with the formality in which ſome take up their reſt.— It aſpires after ſomething greater, ſomething higher, that will remain when the elements ſhall melt with fervent heat, and all things viſible will fade, when every ſpecious pretence, or lofty profeſſion, in which mankind unhappily place their confidence, will no longer avail: But it is through an uniform progreſs in a life of righteouſneſs we are admitted to the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial bankquet of divine love, and having obtained an entrance into the moſt holy place, are enabled to offer the incenſe of worſhip with the firſt born among many generations in the life and love of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>There is a probability ſometimes of thoſe that have been meaſurably quickened and enlivened, who have received a portion of heavenly gift, that would qualify and prepare them for eternal life; there is a probability of theſe turning aſide from the ſpirit of life into the oldneſs of the letter, turning from a ſteady progreſs in the knowledge of him in whom they have believed, into a dependence on exterior

rites and ſhadowy performances, a figurative reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, or ſomething they would gladly hope accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the ſight of God.</p>
            <p>I have ſeen inſtances in the courſe of my life, of ſome whoſe ſouls were once awakened to a deſire after the animating virtue of divine life, as the alpha, or beginning of the ſpiritual creation of God; when deſires were formed after heaven, and yet they have turned aſide from an arduous, laborious, ſteady following on their way; and, if I may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the expreſſion, have loſt themſelves in the flowery fields of imagination: Theſe are ready to think they have attained a ſufficient knowledge of religion and religious duties, and this knowledge has been ſubſtituted inſtead of practice, the muſing of the head to the vital ſenſations of the heart, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion without the poſſeſſion of practical virtue; theſe by ſimilitude, may be ſaid to be loſt in the flowery fields of imagination; they have loſt that light which hath graciouſly viſited them, that holy ſenſe of innocency which once adorned their minds, and in whom were opened a door of hope and divine conſolation to their thirſty ſouls. Alas! that any ſhould thus fall away from their eternal intereſt by continuing to neglect the duties of their day, who are intent and fixt in the notional part without the obedience of faith, and attention to the refreſhing virtue of—"The day ſpringing from on high":—For as happineſs conſiſts in the enjoyment of this eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial

good, may you ſo follow on to know it, as faſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioning you in every Chriſtian virtue, and be confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the poſſeſſion of divine and ardent charity: but beware of that knowledge which puffeth up, and tends not to edification: and may you endeavour to encreaſe in the ſtability of wiſdom with knowledge, and to advance from glory to glory, and from one degree of faith to another, in a daily filial depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon Him, who is willing to ſave, and able to deliver to the utmoſt, all them that come unto God by Him.</p>
            <p>The holy apoſtle was led to obſerve the lamentable ſtate of the Galatian churches, amongſt whom he had laboured and been inſtrumental to raiſe the firſt fruits of divine viſitation, wherein many had been quickened and raiſed to a ſenſe of life; and yet he expoſtulates with them after this manner, "O fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Galatians! who hath bewitched you, that ye ſhould not obey the truth, before whoſe eyes Jeſus Chriſt hath been evidently ſet forth crucified among you?" They, having begun in the Spirit, thought to be made perfect in the fleſh; but it is not by any acts which the fleſh is capable of performing, in the multiplicity of external ſervices propoſed as the means of ſalvation, that can perfect the ſoul. It is here too many are ſtrangers to ſpiritual Chriſtianity, and are alienated from the ſpring of divine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which would ariſe in the dependant thirſty ſoul; that viſits you oftener than the morning, and
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:037439_0267_100D453A136ACF58"/>
would raiſe deſires after life, in all thoſe minds who attentively view its diſcoveries, whether to ſee that my duty be according to the knowledge I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, or whether I fill up with propriety the duties of my day; this would lead the mind where it ought to be led, that is, into a cloſe and ſolemn enquiry after the ſtate and condition of their own ſouls which is of God, and what is contrary to his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly will.</p>
            <p>Hearing is not worſhip: the labour of the voice —a multitude of words—are not worſhip; theſe ſimply cannot conſtitute the eſſential part of "di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſervice:" for though we may pronounce all the truths recorded in holy writ, they cannot anſwer in us this ſecret cry, "Lord, Lord, prepare me for thy kingdom," they are inſufficient to redeem us from the power of death, hell, and the grave; but the work of righteouſneſs is deeper than any ſuperficial form; it is higher than a mere profeſſion, or a name even to the moſt excellent truths that ever were uttered by man: What then is divine worſhip? ſince it conſiſts not in the labour of the tongue, nor proceeds from the head; but it is the ſecret aſpirations of the ſoul to God in every humble and enlightened mind. I will pray with the Spirit, and with the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo, whether I uſe words, or no words, whether language fail, or whether it do not. We have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for language in our mutual engagements, or converſe one with another: but the Holy Infinite
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:037439_0268_100D453BEA4E1FB8"/>
Spirit, by one inſtinctive act of viſion, beholds all the various ſtates and diſpoſitions of mankind.— "I will look towards the holy temple," towards the habitations of HIM, whoſe penetrating eye includes the moſt ſecret thoughts and intents of every heart: I will look towards thy holy temple in this look, in this flame the mind is prepared to offer an accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſacrifice to God, the Lord of heaven, and the whole earth.</p>
            <p>Beware of having begun in the Spirit, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the fleſhly performances of thoſe things which may preſent themſelves as a reſemblance of religious duties. Be what you are, not by a form, or profeſſion, or any contrivance of mankind; but be what you are by the grace of God, and then I make no doubt but a thirſt will then prevail, and "bleſſed are they that hunger and thirſt after righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, for they ſhall be filled." This bleſſing was pronounced by Him that never failed nor ever will, in the performance of the covenant he has made.</p>
            <p>"Bleſſed are they which hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs." As heavenly deſires are raiſed after that food that would ſatisfy the ſoul, it is thus the mind is repleniſhed with the virtue of divine life; for "bleſſed are they which hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs, for they ſhall be filled." This is a, promiſe he would graciouſly accompliſh, in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:037439_0269_100D453D815A5810"/>
of mankind more and more univerſally, to ſupply the hunger of ſuch who may have refuſed comfort, and theſe he would ſatisfy with the good things of eternal life.</p>
            <p>But there are who ſubſtitute a ſimilitude inſtead of practical virtue, and to thoſe appears applicable the myſterious meaning of that expreſſion, which was formerly the language of the church, as cultivated on the mind, "I charge you, O ye daughters of Jeruſalem, by the hinds, and by the roes of the field, that ye ſtir not up, nor awake my Love until he pleaſe;" Or, as in better words, and more properly expreſſed: "I charge you, O ye daughters of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, that ye ſtir not up nor awake my Love, by the hinds, or by the roes of the field, until He pleaſe." Theſe are the light-footed imaginations, in which, perhaps, the mind may be in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure animated, and ſtirred up to duty, but have wandered into the mountains of viſion, and there very frequently exerciſe themſelves in acts of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial devotion, the ſtrict obſervation of exterior forms, and by this means are alſo loſt in the "fields of imagination;" they looſe the capacity of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing betwixt that which is of a divine and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly nature, and the effects of an unſtable mind: betwixt that univerſal righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and a life in the various amuſements of time; theſe are as the hinds and the roes of the field, and are not
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:037439_0270_100D45408CE69CC0"/>
content to await the awakening of his love until he pleaſe. "Ho every one that thirſteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money, come ye buy and eat: buy wine and milk without money and without price."</p>
            <p>O the riches of divine grace, that has thus abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly favoured and bleſſed us with the celeſtial dew, which is of the bounteous mercy of "Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that is in heaven," without money and without price! we have no equivalent wherewith to return the infinite obligation, we have none to plead with or depend upon, no claim of merit to avail ourſelves of, but upon him that ſheweth mercy; with this conſideration we have no righteouſneſs but of Him, no ſtrength but in his ſtrength; neither might nor wiſdom but of Him, let him that glorieth therefore glory in this, that he that ſheweth mercy hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted ability to perform the duties required at their hands.</p>
            <p>And as there is no equivalent, in the returns of gratitude and thankful reverence, for all the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous benefits we receive in the "light of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance," and thus having no adequate ſtrength of our own, may our continual dependence be on "The rock of ſtrength," the ſupport and help of His people.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="254" facs="unknown:037439_0271_100D4542180A4FE8"/>There are ſome who would gladly avail them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of knowledge and the ſtrength of opinion, without a lively poſſeſſion of that "faith that works by love to the purifying of the heart:" This will caſt out every claim to merit, or of ſufficiency, but what proceeds from HIM, "by whom are all things, and we by Him. "Wherefore ſpend ye your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for that which is not bread, and your labour for that which ſatisfieth not." Here let us a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the ſtate and progreſs of ſuch diſpoſed minds, who are negligently ſpending their "money for that which is not bread, and their labour for that which ſatisfieth not."</p>
            <p>What is the reaſon that the convinced of God are not ſo generally converted as might be?—It is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they too frequently apprehend themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and healed in a ſtate of unſoundneſs; theſe grow not up in a ſenſe of divine knowledge and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of ſpiritual things, but inſtead of being confirmed in an holy fortitude, are led to purſue the uncertain mazes of folly; and are ſpending their "money for that which is not bread, and their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for that which ſatisfieth not."</p>
            <p>And I think the reaſon of it may farther be thus underſtood, that it is for want of regarding this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn injunction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="255" facs="unknown:037439_0272_100D4543A5025D80"/>"Hearken diligently unto me."</p>
            <p>Alas! too many whoſe minds have been meaſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly awakened to a ſenſe of duty, are departing after inventions; and by not attending to inſtruction from Him who ſpeaks as never man ſpoke, inſtead of following this voice that is perfect wiſdom, are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in a vain admiration of man.—"I am of Paul, I of Apollos, and I of Cephas." A language ſimilar to this introduced in the apoſtacy and ſeduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the "Shepherd and everlaſting Biſhop of ſouls," has too evidently prevailed in the preſent age, with many who are idolizing perſons; I am of this man, I am of the other man: I eſteem ſuch a one, and I follow the doctrine of ſuch a teacher: This was a means wherewith the enemy of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity ſought to obſtruct the beauty of the primitive churches, and the ſame temptation is ſucceeding in our days. "I am of Paul, I of Apollos, and I of Cephas:" and have not we theſe diſtinctions literally in theſe days in which we live.</p>
            <p>But, I believe there are many whoſe minds, by the animating virtue of divine life, are brought to bear part in that univerſal groan and labour of all creation, which the apoſtle ſpeaks of, and which is in meaſure alive in our days; it was not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloathed, but to be cloathed upon with a houſe from heaven:—Theſe are hearkening to, and following
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:037439_0273_100D45465811FCC0"/>
after the Shepherd and Biſhop of ſouls, that endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to live in the obedience of faith, and in the poſſeſſion of that heavenly virtue, which furniſhes to every good word and work.</p>
            <p>There are ſome, who unable to ſuſtain the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian doctrine, are transferring it from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: theſe would gladly continue in the gratificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſenſe, and hope they can transfer it from themſelves and fix it to another: they are ready to make an ample profeſſion of religion, the ſhadowy performances of religion, in exterior duties; but, alas! they are fallen aſleep in myſterious Babylon, and reſt in a carnal preſumption: but know there is a penetrating holy Eye beholds thee; a voice is heard, "Awake, ariſe, and call upon thy God," a language of this kind has been uttered by the great and heavenly Preacher, who ſearches the deep things of God, and diſcovers the myſteries of iniquity, and all the appendages of myſtery Babylon are open to his view,—"What meaneſt thou, O ſleeper! ariſe, and call upon thy God:" a call that ſeems applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the ſtates of many in the preſent day, and Oh that it might be to the awakening them to a conſciouſneſs of ſin, to a ſenſe of duty; and their eye be turned toward a teacher and inſtructor, the uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring guide to glory.</p>

               <pb n="257" facs="unknown:037439_0274_100D45495218EB58"/>
But a fear attends me, leſt too many are got aſleep again, and dream a dream of unfelt truths; are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len faſt aſleep, in a poſſeſſion of religion, a vocal acknowledgement, the labour of the tongue with unſanctified hearts; but "why ſpend ye your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, for that which is not bread, and your labour for that which ſatisfieth not?" Be convinced of the heavenly efficacy of Divine Grace, and ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a previous ſenſe of its virtue on the ſoul. Why are you ſcattered abroad in the amuſements of the fleſh? Why is the work abortive, and the labours of the day obſtructed? It has appeared to me to be a want of attention to the call of God:—"Hearken diligently unto me;" this is the univerſal language of wiſdom. It is not to any who may be as ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate teachers, as delegated ſhepherds, or ſervants to the flock, who are but men ſubject to the like paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions with you, and are equally liable with you to the ſnares, difficulties, and jeopardies of their race; but our merciful Father has provided a ſafer depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; for as fleſh hath the principle of natural life from the creation, for the animating virtue of Divine Life is imparted from the Son of God, by the immediate communication of his own Spirit, wherein is revealed all that is neceſſary for us to know: this is as I conceive the one important object of all our reverence, worſhip and praiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="258" facs="unknown:037439_0275_100D454B4DFD8718"/>
"Wherefore ſpend ye your money for that which is not bread, and your labour for that which ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth not, hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your ſoul delight itſelf in fatneſs."</p>
            <p>Alas! how many are there, who might have been far advanced on their way to Mount Sion, the holy habitation of the ſaints ſolemnity? nearer that celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial city, whoſe walls are ſalvation, and her gates praiſe; who might have been ſuſtained by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Almighty Wiſdom and Strength, that now are in a feeble ſtate, and incapable of proceeding on the arduous way towards eternal glory; they are turning back again, and are loſt in the fields of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, in matters remote from their eternal inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, who might have been ſharers of celeſtial wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and admitted to tread in the courts of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>"Hearken diligently unto me," ſays the Eternal Word that was before words, and will remain when all language ſhall ceaſe; in this is the acceptable oblation of worſhip and praiſe; and judgment is laid to the line, and righteouſneſs to the plummet, by him who is ſtronger than the ſtrong man armed to caſt him out, with all his goods, the gilded pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Chriſtian name, in thoſe who poſſeſs not its powerful heavenly virtue on the ſoul.</p>

               <pb n="259" facs="unknown:037439_0276_100D454CEF0D6CE8"/>
"Hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good." Oh that the attention of mankind might be more ſolicitouſly engaged in the purſuit of "that which is good" in the glorious benefits of the Chriſtian faith. It is not in the falſe traffic of unfelt truths, but in the demonſtration of the Spirit and with power. May all therefore continue to advance from grace to grace, and from one degree of ſtrength to another, till our dependence be fixed on Him that fills the clouds and empties them at his pleaſure.</p>
            <p>We never ſhall be eſtabliſhed as pillars in the houſe of God, nor never come up in the nobilty and dignity whereto we are called, and to be as orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in families, until we have got beyond the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial beauties of profeſſion, and are engaged in the purſuit of eſſential good, in ardent purſuit after Divine Life. "The watchmen that go about the city found me, to whom I ſaid, ſaw ye him whom my ſoul loveth;—it was but a little that I paſſed from them, I found Him whom my ſoul loveth," and if we find not, we are found of Him who is cloathed with the celeſtial garment of wiſdom, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue this dependant watching ſtate on Him in whom are hid the treaſures of wiſdom and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, who is not variable like man, but ſeeks the good of his ſoul by means of his own Spirit; not fallible like man, but unchangeable and everlaſting
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:037439_0277_100D454FE8354238"/>
are the attributes of wiſdom and goodneſs: hear then his gracious invitation; "Ho, every one that thirſteth, come ye to the waters, and let him that hath no money, come ye buy and eat, yea come, buy wine and milk without money and without price; wherefore do ye ſpend money for that which is not bread, and your labour for that which ſatisfieth not; incline your ear, and hearken dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your ſoul delight itſelf in fatneſs."</p>
            <p>This was the language of Divine Wiſdom, and I know remains to be ſo, to many who are viſited by its power, in the days of diſtreſs, and in the time of youth, when raiſed up by a meaſure of divine approbation ſealed to their minds; thus many are brought to partake of the fountain of infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and being admitted to an acquaintance with the God that made them; theſe, through conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed love, have been engaged to pronounce the glad tidings of ſalvation, and in the ſimplicity of the goſpel, to direct to the Spirit of Chriſt the light and life of man, as the doctrine of eternal redemption, and through divine aſſiſtance of the Holy Spirit, have been made inſtrumental in reviving a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon Him alone, and not upon external acts, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p>May this be the glorious attainment of your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and may your minds with attention hear the voice of Him that ſpeaks as never man ſpoke; it ſpeaks home to thy ſtate, and will be with thee when no eye is near: it will tell thee all that ever thou haſt done, ſhews through the falſe gloſſes put upon acts, and is a diſtinguiſher of the precious from the vile.

Look to the holy Jeſus, the word of life and eternal wiſdom; for I believe there are many in whom a Divine Thirſt has been raiſed after the good that periſhes not, and theſe the Lord of all power would ſatisfy with the good things of eternal life who are willing to come under the chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening of his hand.</p>
            <p>When the idolized objects of ſenſe, or any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance whatſoever has obſtructed the manifeſtation of this their morning light, alas! too many depart from a ſpiritual communion of faith in Chriſt, and lean on man; I am of ſuch a one, I am of this or the other perſuaſion, and thus are profeſſing godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs without the power and wiſdom of God.

the Author of Divine Wiſdom has ever imparted an increaſe of ſtrength, to all who truſt in his name, and that faithfully depend upon him; but his curſe is gone ſorth againſt the impenitent and obdurate ſoul, and if God hath curſed who ſhall bleſs; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore "keep yourſelves from Idols."

            <head>A PRAYER AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE MEETING.</head>
            <p>THINE holy eye beholds the ſolemn and awful reverence in which our ſpirits bow before Thee. O Thou who continually receives the tribute of praiſe from angels and the glorified aſſembly of ſaints, in a ſenſe of thy goodneſs and mercy, the fulneſs which fills heaven and earth, and in which thou art pleaſed to regard the workmanſhip of thy hand, and from day to day, and oftener than the day, to fill the clouds with ſhowers of celeſtial bleſſings, and to viſit in every ſure mercy the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſtates and conditions of thy children, and of all ſuch as look towards thee from the ends of the earth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="268" facs="unknown:037439_0285_100D4561315DE0E0"/>Moſt gracious and adorable fountain of mercy, we humbly beſeech Thee, in the name and in the Spirit of thy dear Son, to write inſtruction upon all our minds, give us to ponder the excellency of thy loving kindneſs, and humble our minds in a ſenſe of ſolemn gratitude, as the ſubject of what we ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to Thee for all theſe thy mercies. Bring us home thus, O Lord, into a connection with thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and to this diſpenſation of thy glorious light, that we may come up to the place where prayer and praiſe are given in faith, and ſupplication is wont to be made.</p>
            <p>Bleſs the profeſſion of truth, the Chriſtian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, yet in a more general manner, and with the knowledge of its truth humble their hearts under their various ſtates. Draw into that which is within the veil: ariſe in the miniſtration of thy power, in the miniſtration of grace, and ſhake both heaven and earth with all the ſubordinate glories of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with all the beauties and excellencies of ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. Let thy judgments come on every hill, and open the door of Lebanon that the fire may devour the cedars; that all the might, the ſtrength, and opinions of mankind, the ſuperficial productions of unfelt truths, may more and more be ſhaken and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and the ſoul be gathered to that which is ſubſtantial, to a dependence upon Him that ſpeaks as never man ſpoke, "Gather us, and we ſhall be

gathered," to Thee the fountain of light, and of eternal life.</p>
            <p>Thus collect us, we pray Thee to thy word of life, may it deſcend as dew, and celeſtial doctrine as tender rain, making fruitful to thy praiſe, and the enlargement of our experience and knowledge of thy truth, with increaſing humility, and reverent walking before thee.</p>
            <p>May it pleaſe Thee, O God of life, yet more and more to ariſe, and ſpread the virtue of thy life upon the minds of the people, and in a peculiar manner upon thoſe who have meaſurably begun in the Spirit, who have known the day ſtar of thy light to ariſe in their minds, who have begun in the Spirit, and want to be made perfect in the fleſh, their fleſhly labours, and activity. But, O Lord God of power, "ariſe, and let thine enemies be ſcattered, that we may come up before Thee in the beauty of holineſs, and in newneſs of life, in amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble walking in circumſpection, and cloathed with the ſpirit of righteouſneſs;" thus may Thou yet bring up the church as out of the wilderneſs, and many may have to ſee thy glory, and to rejoice in it.</p>
            <p>Thus "O Father which art in heaven," enable us with the united ſacrifice of thankſgiving, to render to Thee the attributes of praiſe, and to hallow thy

And it is in view of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable mercy we entreat that "Thy will may be done in us as it is in heaven," with a perfect mind, "and forgive us our treſpaſſes," blot out all our tranſgreſſions; thus, O Lord! dreſs thou our gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and come, and ſave thy people with thy ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ſalvation; be with us in the exerciſes and difficulties of our race, help us along through this uncertain ſtate, cloath thy people with thy ſalvation, and be the deſire of the nations, their peculiar glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry who delight in Thee.</p>
            <p>It is to Thee, the former of heaven and earth, with reverence we repeat a portion of holy, humble worſhip; it is to Thee that makes "the clouds thy chariots, that walketh on the wings of the wind, that layeth the beams of his chambers in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters." It is to Thee whoſe name we cannot ſpeak, whoſe praiſe angels cannot ſufficiently celebrate; it is to Thee whom none can comprehend to the full, the glories of thy name, we lift up our hearts with our hands in the ſolemn act of humble wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wip, intreating that we may acceptably ſpeak there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and aſcribe the praiſe to Thee: "for thine is the kingdom, the Power and the glory, for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more."
