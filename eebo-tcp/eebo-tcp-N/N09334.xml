            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>ADULTERY is become ſo faſhionable, and Divorces ſo frequent, that it may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of ſome debate in the polite world whether the firſt is criminal or the latter diſhonourable: the law, however, judiciouſly puniſhes the one and ſtigmatizes the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Advowtry,</hi> which in the old law-book ſignifies adultery, is the ſin of incontinence between two married perſons; but if only one of the perſons be married, it is, nevertheleſs, adultery. In this laſt caſe, however, it is called ſimple adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, to diſtinguiſh it from the other which is compound. This crime was ſeverely puniſhed by the laws of God, and the antient laws of the land. The Julian law among the old Romans made it death; but in moſt countries (as is the caſe in England) it is at this period puniſhed by fine, and in others by baniſhment. According to the law made by William the Conqueror, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, forced a Woman ſhould loſe his genitals, the offending parts. Before the ſtatute of the 22d Charles II. which made malicious maim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing felony, it was a queſtion, whether cutting off the privy members of a man taken in adultery with another man's wife was felony or not? as an inſtance of which, in the thirteenth year of
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:011898_0003_0F874B2B1061EC88"/>
Henry III. one <hi>John</hi> a monk, being taken by Henry Hull in the act with his wife, he cut off the privy-members, of the monk, and was only indicted for a <hi>maheim,</hi> or maiming.</p>
            <p>Hence it plainly appears that the ſtatute enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the reign of that amorous prince, Charles the Second, who doubtleſs had an eye therein to the very buſineſs in queſtion, hath wonderfully propagated and ſecured the honourable, noble, (I had almoſt ſaid royal) practice of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the drudgery of matrimonial duty; for we cannot ſuppoſe the knight errants of thoſe, or the preſent times, however valorous in eſpouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cauſes, and the protection of their miſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, would have choſen ſo publickly (as they have ſince done) to manifeſt their abilities in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues of this kind, had they run the riſk of legally loſing thoſe very <hi>important</hi> parts, which would ever after have diſqualified them from entering the liſts of gallantry. I ſhall not even ſcruple to ſuppoſe that his R. H. notwithſtanding the many diſguiſes he took upon himſelf, and condeſcenſions he ſubmitted to, would have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevered either in his intrigue, or his <hi>elegant</hi> cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence (which was ſo immediately the means of detection) had not his whole perſon (which certainly includes thoſe parts) been <hi>ſacred,</hi> and had he not been convinced that the greateſt damages that could happen to him, would be only iſſuing a little more money out of the T—y, either for <hi>ſecret</hi> ſervices or publick law-ſuits <note n="†" place="bottom">Vide the Damages obtained by Mr. Wilkes againſt Lord Hallifax, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</note> (as in ſimilar <hi>caſes</hi>) which might, indeed, terminate
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:011898_0003_0F874B2B1061EC88"/>
in an additional tax upon <hi>any thing</hi> left <hi>untaxed,</hi> or a new Stamp Act <hi>properly modified</hi> to <hi>quiet</hi> the minds of the people of North America.</p>
            <p>As to her Ladyſhip ſhe ſeemed reſolved at all events to imbibe the ſublime ſentiments inherent in r—l blood; as either ſhe had, or was very near having a ſimilar connexion with the late duke of Y—k before his departure for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, and which was ſo generally talked of, that at length it was imparted to Lord Gro—r, and a ſeparation had then nearly taken place up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that account; but upon her promiſing his Lordſhip in the moſt ſolemn manner that ſhe would never again ſpeak to <hi>that</hi> R. H. in <hi>private,</hi> he forgave her. Indeed, her Ladyſhip may plead ſomething in her excuſe, beſides her fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for an alliance with r—l blood; as it is well known that her marriage was not a match of her own choice; but ſtrongly recommended to her by her parents. An anecdote is handed about of her firſt acquaintance with his Lordſhip, which is as follows: Lord G— had in his youth led a very debauched life, and had almoſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed his conſtitution, by a certain diſeaſe which is never communicated but by the ladies; his phyſicians therefore adviſed him, as the only means of preſerving the ſmall ſhare of health that he remained poſſeſſed of, to marry: he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly reſolved to marry the firſt woman of family that was agreeable to him, without paying any regard to fortune. Juſt as he had come to this reſolution, he was walking one day in Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſington gardens, whilſt his coach was waiting for him at the gate, and a ſhower of rain <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="vi" facs="unknown:011898_0004_0F874B2E1FE4A470"/>
on, he took ſhelter in the ſame alcove where Miſs V—n (his preſent lady) and her ſiſter <hi>Carry</hi> had retired for ſhelter. After ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon converſation upon the weather, and other general topicks, he aſked the ladies, if they had not a carriage at hand, to do him the honour of taking part of his; which, with very little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty, they conſented to, as it was likely to be a rainy evening. His Lordſhip was at firſt-ſight ſtruck with Miſs V— and was only waiting for an opportunity of ſaying a civil thing to her, when upon the road Miſs V— declaring,
<q>ſhe thought his Lordſhip's coach was the eaſieſt ſhe ever rode in;</q>
he replied
<q>he was very happy at its meeting with her approbation; and that ſhe might be miſtreſs of it whenever ſhe pleaſed.</q>
She bluſhed, without making any reply, which he conſtrued into a favourable omen; and the next day he applied to her rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to obtain their conſent to pay his addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to Miſs V—. So great a match highly flattered her mother's ambition; and ſhe prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Miſs V— to give his Lordſhip her hand, though ſhe then declared he was very diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to her; add to this, her mother, who, on account of her employment in the princeſs Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia's houſhold, ſtrove upon every occaſion to ſhew the greateſt reſpect to all the r—l family, conſtantly recommended to her daughter <hi>never to refuſe any thing</hi> the K—'s brother requeſted;— which lady G—r has moſt <hi>dutifully obeyed.</hi> This ſhe may, at leaſt, plead as ſome excuſe to her relations; but it is a moot point whether it is ſo good a one as what F—te made for her to lady
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:011898_0004_0F874B2E1FE4A470"/>
H—r—n ſome weeks ſince, when he was taking chocolate with her.—
<q>Good heaven, ſaid her ladyſhip, is it not aſtoniſhing that lady G—r ſhould prefer the D— of C— to lord G—!</q>
               <q>not at all, my Lady, <hi>replied the wag,</hi> for his R. H. is only <hi>Dis—</hi> but his L—p is <hi>DEATH</hi> itſelf.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now we have introduced F—te we ſhall alſo introduce a few more of his <hi>bon mots</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this occaſion. He ſaid the other day,
<q>the preſent K— had created Sir Richard G—r a <hi>Lord,</hi> and his brother had created him a <hi>Cuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kold</hi>; dignities ſomewhat ſimilar according to the preſent times; and the more ſo as they had both tipt his head with gold, the firſt his <hi>coronet,</hi> the laſt his <hi>horns.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>His R. H. aſked F—te, the laſt time he dined with him at North-End, what he thought about his Letters that were read in court.—
<q>Think, pleaſe your H—s, (ſaid Sam) it is impoſſible to think about them, as you never once thought when you wrote them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>His R. H. told F—te, a ſhort time ſince, in great confidence,
<q>That Lady G—r was one of the moſt ſenſible women in England; and that he ſhould one day or other ſee her Letters.</q>
The day after the trial this genius ſaid,
<q>I am convinced of what your R. H. ſaid.—She is a damn'd ſenſible woman as to <hi>parts</hi>; but it was left for a man of your H—s's penetration to diſcover her genius.</q>
The ſame great mimic obſerved,
<q>That in ſeveral parts of the country a certain perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, in the courſe of his intrigue, was taken,
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:011898_0005_0F874B2EA9E76EA8"/>
by his diſguiſe in a black wig, for a horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtealer and a highwayman; but no where for a <hi>conjurer.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>It is poſitively aſſerted that this courſe of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence was not the firſt grounds of ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion: for that lord G—, having ſurpriſed a packet with one of the D— of C's curious epiſtles ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to his Lady, which Mrs. Reda the mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lener, oppoſite St. Alban's-ſtreet, Pall-mall, was bringing to her immediately after her lying-in, or at leaſt before ſhe had been abroad; his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip had the great good nature, upon her Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's aſſuring him that nothing had paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween her and the D— but indiſcretions of the leaſt vicious kind, not only to forgive her, but aſſure her, that if ſhe gave him no cauſe for future diſcontent, the diſcovery he <hi>had made</hi> ſhould never be public, nor go farther than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and her. But the interception of the firſt letter annexed rekindled all his reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The Editor of theſe ſheets has taken the earlieſt opportunity of laying them before the public, as this is the moſt important and remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Trial that ever came before a court of judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature; and the only one that has any ſimilarity to it, fell out in the laſt century, when Robert earl of Southeſk charged his R. H. James duke of York (afterwards James II.) with an amour with his counteſs; but it was never brought into court: nor is there, perhaps, any precedent in any country of a like proceſs; and though no more than 10,000l. damages were granted, it evidently demonſtrates the integrity and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:011898_0005_0F874B2EA9E76EA8"/>
ſentiments of a Britiſh jury, who pay no regard to rank, title, or ſtation, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter juſtice with equal impartiality, from the firſt to the laſt ſubject in the land. His lordſhip has thereby obtained all he deſired by this verdict,—a divorce; and had he received ten times the damages he would have applied it in the like manner he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes doing theſe, by diſtributing them to the moſt uſeful and beneficial public charities. So little temptation, indeed, has money in the eyes of his Lordſhip, that it is confidently aſſerted that 50,000l. were offered from a certain quarter, to ſtop the proſecution, but nobly refuſed by his Lordſhip.</p>

            <p>It was contended by the counſel for the defendant, that the laying the damage at 100,000<hi>l.</hi> was exceſſive and immoderate; but to this it was anſwered, that, in the reign of Charles the Second, much higher damages were ſued for by the then Duke of York, againſt one Pilkington, a Sheriff of the city of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, in an action of <hi>ſcandalum magnatum,</hi> in the King's Bench, and a verdict of 100,000<hi>l.</hi> was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in his favour; and it was farther urged, that when the injury was done to an inferior, that circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance alone greatly aggravated the offence.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wedderburn, in the courſe of opening the cauſe, ſtrongly inſiſted on the caſe becoming more criminal on account of the rank of the defendant: This he inſtanced in two caſes; the firſt was that of Lord Belvidere in the kingdom of Ireland, whoſe bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (Mr. Rochford) having crim. con. with his lady, his lordſhip obtained 20,000<hi>l.</hi> damages, tho' the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant's fortune was no way anſwerable to ſuch a ſum. The other was a caſe of defamation brought by James II. when Duke of York, againſt a tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the city, when the damages were likewiſe laid high: "And theſe, continued the learned counſel, were given for very ſubſtantial reaſons; to ſhew ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:011898_0007_0F874B301DB84AA8"/>
that where particular duty and reſpect is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, an action of criminality becomes doubly ſo, when theſe ties are broke through.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wedderburn then methodically ſtated the facts. He ſet forth, that his R. H. in his excurſions to Towceſter in Northamptonſhire, Coventry, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court-Hill, Whitchurch in Shropſhire, Cheſter, and St. Alban's, in order to meet Lady G—r, aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, at different times, the names of 'Squire Morgan, 'Squire Jones, the Farmer, &amp;c. that he ſometimes appeared as a young 'Squire diſordered in his ſenſes, and uſed to be called at the inns the Fool, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly at Whitchurch, where a noiſe being heard in paſſing from one room to the other, it was diſregarded by the people of the houſe, who ſaid it was only the Fool; and that he had taken down with him to St. Alban's a ſervant, who went by the name of Truſty, for the purpoſe of carrying on his intrigue with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſecurity: That they had witneſſes to prove, that Lady G— was ſeveral times carried to the back door of the D. of C's houſe in the Park, where ſhe went in, and ſtaid for a conſiderable time. That ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of Lord G—'s ſervants went down to St. Alban's with his Lordſhip's brother, who, upon breaking open the door at the inn, found the D. of C. ſitting on the bed-ſide along with lady G—, with his waiſtcoat looſe, and the lady with her Dreſden unbuttoned, and her breaſts wholly expoſed; that on their entering, her ladyſhip made towards the door of communication with the next room, but in the attempt fell; on which he, who was left to guard the door they entered by, went to her aſſiſtance, which his R. H. availed himſelf of, and run out, calling on them, when he got on the other ſide of the door, "to take notice, he was not found in the room; and that he would take his Bible oath, he was not."</p>
            <p>But Mr. Wedderburn ſaid, previous to his calling ſeveral witneſſes to prove this, and many other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant facts, he ſhould read to the court ſeveral let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:011898_0008_0F874B3122264770"/>
written by Lady G—r to the D. of C. and from the D. of C. to her ladyſhip, which would ſet the nature of their connexion beyond a doubt; firſt premiſing by what means they had fallen into Lord G—r the plaintiff's hands.</p>
            <p>His lordſhip meeting with one of his ſervants, near Cheſter, going with a letter from his Lady to put into the poſt, ſtopt him to go upon another errand, taking the letter, and ſaying he would put it in himſelf: he then had the curioſity to open it, which he found to be the firſt <note n="†" place="bottom">See p. 22.</note> letter from Lady G— to his R. H. when, after having taken a copy of it, he put it into the poſt, and intercepted all the reſt.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wedderburn then read the letters in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing order.</p>

                     <p>he appears rather in better temper to day, ſo I'm in great hopes he did not get enough of the Letter to make out much he ſtayed out very late laſt night which seems to have occaſioned a <hi>weezing</hi> to day, by the means of my Siſters I think I can ſend and receive my Letters very safe for the future.

                  <p>HOW happy you made me by your Letter it ſeem ages to me ſince I heard from you tho' in reality not many days, but Minutes count for years with thoſe that love, but I dont like to hear that you have ſtill a little cough you dont take care of yourſelf, I wiſh I could take care of you indeed— he went out yeſterday morning to Hallkin and Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well and dont return till tomorrow dinner, he left Mr. Gros—r and 3 or 4 people with me, who are gone and Mr. G— is juſt gone out for an hour, so I take this favourable time to write to you and ſhall ſend it off in the Morning, I long moſt heartily for the time I ſhall ſee you again, your letter came per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſafe, I was ſo happy to get it, I hope you will have received my laſt ſafe where I sent you the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Hollywell, only think of your having loſt your road to Tarpolly I ſhould have been so miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble if I'd known it at the time I'm ſo ſorry, how dreadful at that time of night its a terrible intricket road, I'd a very odd diſcourſe with Mr. G— to day about my Lord he firſt begun by saying he was very uneaſy about his health and did not think he was ſo well as he uſed to be &amp; he ought to take great care, he after that ſaid he thought he gave up his whole time attention and fortune to Horſes and was worse and worse infatuated than ever about them and that he never could talk upon any other ſubject therefore he never could have any diſcourſe with him and that he would lose all his acquaintance but Jockeys, I could not help laughing at his deſcription of him which was very juſt for sais he he will ſet for half an hour with his eyes fixed on a Table or Chair and then apply to Tomm or any body that is by, do you know what Mare ſuch a Filly was out of, or can you tell what Horse ſuch a Colt was got by, by God, I have got the beſt stud in England no body will have any horſes to run but me very ſoon, then if he or any body that

don't underſtand that ſubject offers to mention any thing else he is as croſs as any thing for half an hour, and then faſt aſleep, so sais Mr. G— you ſee nobody ever comes to ſee him but in partys. I never do ſais he I always get people to come every day to meet me or elſe I know my amuſement would be to ſee him ſnoring in one corner of the room inſtead of being ſociable &amp; like other people—this was as you may imagine a Tete a Tete subject but its so exact a picture of him I was reſolved you ſhould have it—I'll tell you how I paſs my time I get up about eight or I'm afraid nine Breakfaſt at ten then walk or ride dine at 3, ſtupifie or play at ſtupified Cards after Tea with any body that drops in (he never plays) this lasts till ſupper but I now &amp; then ſteal off we ſup ſoon after nine, and in bed before eleven, where I always dream of you my Deareſt Friend—I hope ſoon to have a letter from Carry with ſome writing from you in Milk, I fancy we ſhant go to Mrs. H—, till Wedneſday when I ſhall hope for a letter from you if it arrives before me it will be safe as I'd a letter to day to ſay if any came from Carry they ſhould be taken care off, I imagine we ſhant come away till quite the end of the week and ſhall then be ſo happy in the thoughts of ſeeing you in a few days, how I long for the 1ſt and 2d of December and yet it is being too ſelfiſh for what a ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation for you but I'll say no more of that as you are so kind to say you dont mind it, to day is my Birth day, I think it has turned out quite lucky to me as I've ſuch an opportunity of writing to you. Mr. G— is come home which obliges me to ſhorten it and vexes me, tho' I've nothing but nonsense to talk off—I dont like to be interrupted and prevented and I muſt write to Carry a line as I incloſe this to her, I ſee Almacks begins the 1ſt Dec. do take a dance there and tell me how it looks it will make but two days difference &amp; I cant bear to prevent you from every thing O dear I am always a teazing you, I think I'm quite provoked at myſelf, I wiſh to God I was the only one to ſuffer in an uncomfortable ſituation and

I'd bear every thing with pleaſure but the thoughts of my deareſt Friend being unhappy is ten times more to me than any thing I could ever ſuffer, indeed my deareſt life it is believe me that is my greateſt anxiety and concern, I can never make you amends but my ſincereſt love you ſhall ever have from the bottom of my soul that you are kind enough to say you value and as long as you eſteem it and give me yours it will be our mutual comfort, God bleſs you my deareſt Soul, I'm glad the time is fixed for the Parliament meeting which I hope will bring us to Town Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well a thouſand times moſt ſincerely till we meet</p>

                  <p>YOUR laſt Letter I must own my dear little Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry makes me very uneasy as I was very plain you was in very low Sperrits, &amp; I'm afraid indeed not well, I am ſure I love you too well to riſque run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning you into any scrape therefore if there is the leaſt Appearance of it I wd not give any Chance of it for the World. the report you know my love is very

false therefore that particular dont make me uneaſy as it will be proved to the contrary by seeing we live to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, it was ſome spiteful perſon raised it malicious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and very ſilyly indeed As the whole world muſt see the contrary, Mama's mentioning it in a ſerious ſtyle to you was very ridiculous as ſhe knows we are living together here &amp; it may be of some use both in regard to her &amp; the World in general as they will se falſe reports rais'd, if you remember there was exactly the same report raised of Ly Barrymore about the time she was at Bath, the people seeing that falſe (and I remember myſelf for one) said we imagined every thing else was so &amp; I aſsure you my deareſt Carry I propoſe behaving in such a manner as will be quite proper and clever when I come to Town which I hope will be very ſoon and I ſhall tell you all my plans when I have the happineſs of ſeeing you—Mama's behaviour to you &amp; ſpeaking to you in that manner I do aſsure you hurts me much more than any thing in regard to myself; how little Mama's friendſhip is worth having when ſhe is turned and wound about every different way by a little flattery if ſhe was my friend to day &amp; abuſed my enemy, if to morrow they falsely told her they lov'd her by way of emposing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her, &amp; getting her to their sides ſhe would ſtill be more inveterate againſt me than she had been againſt them—I have been very ill us'd in the World &amp; thoſe that have profeſs'd themſelves my friends have ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally acted to me in this style, you my Dear Carry have been a real friend, and I ſhall ever acknowledge it with my laſt Breath, and ever be sincere to you I only wiſh it may ever be in my power to ſerve you I would be happy beyond meaſure to prove it to you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I would, I am capable of ſincere friendſhip, I've only my own word for it now, but will prove it with joy and thankfully if fortune will but let me—my poor Friend indeed has taken a most terable Journey and only just seen me twice, they are very prudent &amp; told me the 2d time they ſhould set out immediately for fear of danger, You ſe by this means my love it

was empoſsible for me to write as I did not know it till then, and you know that in the Place I saw them it was impoſsible to write, or indeed my Dear I should not have been so ungratefull not to have wrote as I promised &amp; anſwer'd yours—my dear I am very low spiretted I wish I could have a fly over to you &amp; talk every thing over and I do believe we shou'd make one another easyer, when you know how I propose to act—I wd not have you indeed send any more to S—ros as your Servants seem to suspect and be ſo croſs about, for I would not have you run a risk for me for the World. If I had had an idea of it I wou'd not have ever ask'd you, but I thought by one way or other either happening to call or send as it was only now and then it wd not be suspected, but as they once begin to think, its much better to do it no more, I deſired my Friend to send Saturday Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for this &amp; to ſend one to you as I thought that way would be safe &amp; I'm to send another for them to send for on Thurſday sev night, unleſs you think it will be dangerous if so let me know and I'll never send again, but contrive some way juſt for one more or so which will be all I ſhall have occaſion to write before I ſet out just to let them know the day we set out for we ſhall set out I do believe &amp; hope in leſs than three Weeks for he said to day he did not believe he shod stay so long as he at first thought which was againſt the Meeting of Parliament so may be we may set out in a Fortnight he seems horridly tir'd of this place &amp; is fidgeting for ever into Wales &amp;c he ſets out for Wales to morrow and only came back from there sunday so I hope it cannot poſsibly belong now before I ſhall see my dear little Carry again don't be low my dear love I'm afraid you'll make yourself ill, I wiſh to God you had a little Country air—never mind what any of them ſays nor let them vex you I'v a vast good plan to tell you of; ſo if people don't change their note this Winter, I know you are laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; think I am only building Caſtles in the air, but

thought of the cold dreadful Journey you have had indeed I've been miserable about you, I'm afraid you are ſcarcely arrived yet, I've not heard any news at all about you but I've been very low spireted ever since tho I've hid it as much as in my power, I dont know to expreſs my gratitude to you for the constant proofs you give me of the sincerity of your affection, I'm sure all the trouble you have taken only just to se me thoroughly convinces me of it you say all the return you desire is my affection and Friendship in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed you have them most sincerely, my heart is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways with you indeed it is my deareſt Friend— they came home sunday to dinner he was here a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before the rest he came on horseback as he rode part of the way I grew in a fright least as he rode he might have come to shorten the way through the fields &amp; met you, but hoped as he did not arrive till neariſh 3 that you was got to where you dined first, to day they are gone to Chester to dinner, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow I believe they set out for Wales again for 2 days, I wiſh we had known it beforehand and may be we might have contrived to have made some use of it but perhaps it may in the end be better as it is, I hope I ſhall have the happineſs of hearing from you &amp; if he is in Wales I shall endeavour to catch my letter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he comes—I hope C wont make any objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to receiving &amp; sending the letters by the means you propose of sending Trusty to her, if she does pray let me know &amp; I'll be sure to find a method of writing to you, &amp; I'll tear my brains to pieces but I'll find some way of hearing once or twice from you while we are here I thank God I dont beleive it will be long for he has been taking to day of ſetting out &amp; sais he believes he shall go before he at firſt thought of which was against the meeting of Parliament, as I am in vast hopes he will fix the day soon, &amp; I will immediately write you word when I know, as ſoon I hear from you and C— and find if I may write again by her I will take the firſt moment any how if I dont hear to the contrary from C— I'll write

the beginning of next week that if you send on Thursday sevenight it will be at C—y's I shall be sure to find some opportunity as I dare say he will not be long together at home—while I feel it so cold I'm in pain and Misery for you good God in thoſe post Chaises how starving it must be I'm so in fear it ſhou'd hurt your breast, do take care of your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self pray my Dear Dear Friend and if you aint quite well pray take some advise, don't take it ill my plaguing you so but really I love you so much I cant help wishing you to take more care of your health.</p>
                  <p>he seems in a tolerable humour not much one way nor other but still drinks toaſt &amp; water and very little wine he had a little weazing last night, I suppose dining out to day wont do him much good he sais as the weather is so cold he could get off his busineſs in Wales, but I realy believe he is very glad of any excuse to carry him there as he dont seem to know what to do with himſelf at home</p>
                  <p>I do believe &amp; hope there is no suspicions about you, &amp; indeed tho painful I'm ſure to both of us I really beleive it was the moſt prudent thing posible to go before people talked or began to suspect; nothing here has happened worth relating, I've Breakfaſt'd din'd &amp; sup't gone to bed &amp; rise at the same hour as uſual but we rehearst our play in my Room the other night, I fancy it will be done middling well its a most horrid play but they will have it, I muſt act both the womens characters we are not to have the general Rehearsal in the Playhouse till Monday evening— indeed my dear ſoul you are very prudent in intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to go a little in publick before I come to town, it wou'd really look much too particular just to come out then &amp; might cause remarks which poſſibly might be conveyed to my Ld. &amp; every thing of that sort might rouse him &amp; make him more and more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servant to prevent our Meetings, and the best thing we can poſsibly do now is to make him believe it is

all over between us, and we have really I beleiv blinded him for some time at leaſt he has no proof about us, &amp; I hope to God that by degrees his suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions will be lull'd &amp; then we may form some plans for our meeting happily we must not dispair but look forwards that is the only way to support ourselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our present unhappy situation &amp; there is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of many things happening to mend the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, so we think like Philoſophers &amp; believe every thing is for the beſt &amp; hope we may enjoy better days soon, &amp; indeed I think it very probable my dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est &amp; dear Soul with this idea be happy, if I knew you were ſo I shou'd be more than half way to it, as I aſsure you what concerns you is more to me than my own feelings upon any thing. God forbid there should be a Warr if you go what then remains for me but misery, dont lets think on that, no, its wrong, one must not meet misfortunes, but how can I talk so, I'm sure that is not adopting the Style I before proposed to look forward for better times—I shall long to hear from you my dear life, indeed I do, I am afraid you had a miserable Journey indeed, I hope C— will manage our letters as you send, if she wont dont be uneasy I'll certainly contrive some other means to write and to hear from you—I shall write to C— as soon as I've done this &amp; perſuade her all I can, I really think no body can suspect any thing as you said—so if you send to her the Thurs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day after you get this you'll find another from me, I think I have better now conclude and write my letter to C— as I imagine he will come home pretty soon, or I could write to you for ever, indeed my dearest Soul I could tire you to death with my non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense—I shall only now add what I have often said to you my Deareſt Friend, that you may ever be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of my tendereſt &amp; most sincere affections &amp; that I shall ever remain in the truest sense of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsion</p>

            <p>He aſked (as the words <hi>mutual feelings</hi>
               <note n="§" place="bottom">See Letter III. and Letter XII.</note>, and
<q>I hope I ſhall never have occaſion to <hi>repent</hi> this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,</q>
were mentioned in one of her letters) "What <hi>mutual</hi> feelings ſhould paſs between a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried woman and any other perſon but her huſband? Or, why the word <hi>repent</hi> ſhould be uſed, if it did not ſtrongly imply a foregone diſhonour?" He obſerv "That it would be given the Jury in evidence that his R— H— had aſſumed the fictitious name of <hi>Morgan,</hi> a country 'Squire, not very <hi>ſound</hi> in his <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding</hi>; that he had taken down a ſervant with him to St. Alban's, who went by the name of <hi>Truſty,</hi> for the purpoſe of facilitating this amour." He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore aſked, "What pain of mind it muſt coſt his R— H—, for one of his elevated ſtation to aſſociate himſelf for ſeveral days with his own ſervant, paſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a fictitious name, and forego all thoſe honours and diſtinctions uſually paid to his rank, if he had not this diſhonourable ſcheme in purſuit?"</p>
            <p>After finiſhing theſe obſervations, which were made with great accuracy and judgment, he told the Jury, "That they had two principal objects for their obſervation. The firſt was the very great quality of the defendant, and the ſecond the irreparable injury ſuſtained by the plaintiff. As to the former, he ſaid, no given ſum could be puniſhment ſufficient, as the elevated rank and ſituation of life he ſuſtained, ſhould the more deter him from ſetting a bad example to the ſubordinate claſſes of ſociety." He obſerved, "There were certain ſituations in life, that made the ſame offence more criminal in one than another, on account of the greater duties they may owe the offended party in particular, or ſociety in general. This he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced in the caſe of a ſervant proſecuted for <hi>crim. con.</hi> with his maſter's wife, when the damages were
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:011898_0022_0F874B3FD87AF7C0"/>
laid very conſiderable, though the offending party had no fortune to bear it; and this he ſaid was done for very wiſe purpoſes; to point out to ſociety the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er breach of duty in a ſervant, from whom confidence, reſpect, and fidelity, were more immediately expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed." He obſerved, in the preſent caſe, tho' the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages may be thought to be laid high, yet, as it was all the puniſhment the law could inflict, none of it ought to be remitted, as they had it now in their power to convince his R— H— in particular, and every man of rank in general, "That the laws of England in the hands of a BRITISH Jury, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſuperior to ſituation and connections. He like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe hoped, that this would, in future, direct his R. H. to nobler purſuits than the ſeduction of the wife of a Peer, and incline him to copy from a very near relation of his (meaning his M.) whoſe conjugal at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachments, abſtracted from his other virtues, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ornamented the throne he filled, but ſhewed a bright example to his ſubjects in general."</p>
            <p>And now, gentlemen, continued the learned and eloquent Counſel, I ſhall leave you in poſſeſſion of theſe ſentiments, and only direct one thing more to your conſideration; which is, that you have now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you the chaſtity and honour of the ſex, the ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of marriage, and the cuſtody of Britiſh morals, and that your determination will ſeverally operate on each of theſe."</p>

               <p>That this witneſs did not obſerve any thing very particular about Lady G's dreſs, as ſhe turned about very quick. Nor did he obſerve any thing very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular about the D's dreſs.</p>

That on the 21ſt of December laſt, between ten and eleven o'clock, his brother broke open the door of Lady G's bed chamber; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the laſt witneſs in all that followed.</p>
               <p>Several other witneſſes were called on in ſucceſſion, who all corroborated the diſcovery at St. Alban's, which ſeemed the principal point aimed at by the plaintiff's counſel.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dunning began the defence with obſervations on the proof, which he ſaid was ſo far from being poſitive, that it was not circumſtantial; and that if it were admitted upon this occaſion, it would open a door for many artifices that might be practiſed upon the unwary by artful women, in combination with their huſbands. After expatiating upon the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety and danger of allowing ſuch proofs, which he did with great energy, he then produced the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exculpatory witneſſes.</p>

               <p>Theſe witneſſes being examined, the Counſel for the Plaintiff gave the reply, which laſted a full hour, and in one part particularly created a great laugh in obſerving, "That however aggravating the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances were otherwiſe, they could not charge his R.

               <p>Lord Mansfield began about half an hour after ſix, and, with his uſual clearneſs, ſummed up the proof

with the utmoſt ſtrictneſs and impartiality, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with ſaying, "That the jury were to conſider the damages received, and give an adequate recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence to the perſon injured, and not give a ſum as a puniſhment upon the perſon who committed that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury.

               <p>Upon the arrival of the jury at Lord Mansfield's, in Bloomſbury-ſquare, a number of people, whoſe curioſity was very great, had collected together round the door; and before the jury had well got into the houſe, many ruſhed in with them, Lord Mansfield being acquainted with the arrival of the jury, he came into the hall from his room, by a private door; and being attended by the proper officers of the Court, the uſual queſtions were aſked, whether they were agreed in their verdict, and who ſhould ſpeak for them? when he received their verdict, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately withdrew.
