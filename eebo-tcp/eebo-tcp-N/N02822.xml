            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Two Interests RECONCILED:</head>
            <p>IT is not a common Thing to meet with an Answerer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ill Nature or ill Manners, and that entirely confines him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to his Subject: But the Author of <hi>The Interest of the Country,</hi> has had the good Fortune to find such a one, in the Writer of <hi>The Interest of City and Country.</hi> The Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick may therefore, reasonably, expect some Information from these two Papers, by comparing them together, and following that which seems to
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:003363_0003_0FF81AECAEB8AD98"/>
carry most Reason with it. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause every Body has not Leisure enough to do this, with much Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I thought it would be of Use to take that Trouble for them: And that I may not have Occasion to repeat the whole Title at every Turn, I shall, for Brevity's sake, call the first Writer <hi>The Country-Man,</hi> and the second <hi>The Citizen.</hi> What will make my Labour still shorter, is the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of these <hi>Writers</hi> in several Points, which I must first consider, before I take Notice of what <hi>they</hi> differ in. And if this Method was taken, in most Disputes, about which People are used to be very Warm, they would very often be ended, almost as soon as begun.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Writers</hi> then agree, <hi>That the Government ought to be Supported; that it is for the Benefit of the Province that it should be so; and that every Body is, as they hope, of the same mind.</hi> It is the End <hi>they</hi> both propose to <hi>themselves,</hi> though <hi>they</hi> differ about some of the Means, that this should
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:003363_0004_0FF81AEEDDE22968"/>
be effected, <hi>with the least burthen to the People,</hi> and <hi>with the least Prejudice to Trade and Industry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Country-Man's</hi> first Maxim, <hi>That we should avoid, as much as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, to add any Charge to the Trade, Industry or Labour of the People,</hi> is likewise the <hi>Citizen's</hi> main <hi>Assertion,</hi> which <hi>his</hi> whole Discourse is writ on purpose to prove.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Country-Man</hi>'s second Maxim, <hi>That the Support of Government should be laid on Vice,</hi> &amp;c. would not meet with any Opposition from the <hi>Citizen,</hi> if he thought it practicable: He a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees that <hi>Vice should be prevented,</hi> but then <hi>he</hi> thinks <hi>The Government will be but little Supported, by such a contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance</hi>: As for Instance, in the <hi>Duty of Rum</hi>; if the <hi>Duty</hi> is laid on to prevent Drinking, then little <hi>Duty</hi> will be paid whenever there is but little Drinking; but if there is much <hi>Duty</hi> paid, there must still be much Drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: So that one Way or the other, <hi>he</hi> thinks, <hi>it will not Answer.</hi> But it must be allowed <hi>That Vice cannot be
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:003363_0005_0FF81AF0D6844070"/>
totally suppressed at once</hi>; and where that is attempted, it often encreases out of meer Contradiction: And so it would be in Case of a total Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of <hi>Rum,</hi> it would then be imported clandestinely, and drunk out of Spite; whereas a moderate <hi>Duty</hi> checks the Importation in some De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and makes it self be felt in the Pocket of the excessive Consumer; which may be a likelier Means to reclaim him than severer Methods. There was a remarkable Instance of this Kind in <hi>England,</hi> when it was attempted to suppress the <hi>Dissenters</hi> by Penal Laws; the Effect was, <hi>That the Meetings encreased, and the Churches grew empty</hi>: But on the contrary, when the Toleration was granted, <hi>The Dissenters decreased, and the Churches filled.</hi> The meer Inconvenience of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing to maintain two Ministers, insensibly brought about, in a great Measure, that <hi>Union</hi> which Severity had set at a greater Distance.</p>
            <p>So that as to the second Maxim, I think, what the <hi>Country-Man</hi> and <hi>Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:003363_0006_0FF81AF285ABACE8"/>
have said, may be easily recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Country-Man</hi>'s third Maxim, <hi>That Trade had better be taxed than the Labour or Manufactures of the People,</hi> seems, at first sight, to be very opposite to the <hi>Citizen</hi>'s Way of Thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. But if we observe, on one Hand, that the <hi>Citizen</hi> is not for taxing <hi>Labour or Manufacture</hi> any more than the <hi>other</hi>; and that his chief Reason for not burdening <hi>Trade</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is, <hi>Because he thinks he has found a more equal Way of raising Money, without taxing any of them</hi>: And on the other Hand, that the <hi>Country-Man</hi> only chuses to tax <hi>Trade,</hi> rather than <hi>Labour,</hi> because he had not thought of <hi>Any probable Way to avoid them both.</hi> We shall find that these <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors</hi> would easily be agreed, if the <hi>Citizen</hi>'s Expedient can be made prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable: Nay more, the <hi>Country-Man</hi> ought to come into it, in conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of his Maxim <hi>To discourage Vice</hi>; for <hi>Laziness</hi> and <hi>Covetousness</hi> are certainly <hi>Vices</hi>; and these the <hi>Citizen</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:003363_0007_0FF81AF5167A3620"/>
is for discouraging in <hi>the Engrossers of great Tracts of Land, who neither Sell nor Improve them; which he thinks a Wrong to both King and Country.</hi> This <hi>he</hi> proposes to do by <hi>A general Tax to be laid upon the true Value of Men's Estates, whether in Land or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi>: By which the Poor would certainly pay very little, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious not near so much as they who may sit at Home with their Hands in their Pockets, and be dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly growing richer by the Industry of others. These Persons are of two sorts, some who have <hi>Money,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who have <hi>Lands.</hi> They who have <hi>Money,</hi> may enjoy a very high Interest for it from those who must work hard, from one End of the Year to the other, to pay it, and very often go to Jayl before they can repay the Principal. While In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest is at so high a Rate, <hi>Trade</hi> can never flourish, because the Profit must be very great to make it do. In <hi>Spain,</hi> where <hi>Interest</hi> is at <hi>Ten per Cent.</hi> they have, by that Means, suffered
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:003363_0008_0FF81AF74AA5E420"/>
all their <hi>Trade</hi> to fall into the Hands of the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> who are much better able to carry it on, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Money is but at the <hi>Interest</hi> of <hi>Three</hi> or <hi>four per Cent.</hi> among them. Nothing therefore can be plainer, than <hi>That Persons who have Money out at</hi> Interest <hi>can much better afford to be</hi> Taxed <hi>than any to whom they lend it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They who have <hi>Lands</hi> which they will neither Sell nor Improve suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently, are another sort who may well pay <hi>Taxes,</hi> according to the value for which those <hi>Lands</hi> might be Sold; for this value rises continually, as fast as Money does by Interest; and all this, by means of the Industry of their Neighbours, and the encrease of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the Province, who would add still more to the Produce of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, if they could purchase Land at reasonable Rates. So that <hi>these Engros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers of Land,</hi> are more hurtfull to the <hi>Publick,</hi> than <hi>the Lenders of Money at high Interest</hi>; because the <hi>latter,</hi> make some circulation of their Estate, tho'
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:003363_0009_0FF81AF9C7024408"/>
at an immoderate Profit; but the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> have a dead Treasure lying by them, which they cannot spend, and which is not only of no use to the <hi>Publick,</hi> but of manifest Hindrance to the Peopling and Improving of the Province: And for this Reason it is, that so many Families remove into Neighbouring Provinces to buy Land, by which we are yearly losing great Sums of Money, and great Numbers of our People.</p>
            <p>Now, what has been said, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to shew, that the <hi>Citizen</hi>'s Scheme is highly reasonable; let us next consider whether it is Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable. I am afraid that the Reason which <hi>he</hi> gives for it, will rather prove an Objection; it is, <hi>that the Burthen will not fall heavy on the Poor, for they that have little, will pay little. he</hi> might have added, that the Day Labourer and Trades-Man will often pay nothing at all; for as they ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally live meerly from Hand to Mouth, and commonly spend before they get, their Estate is nothing.
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:003363_0010_0FF81AFB669B83B0"/>
Now I would ask the <hi>Citizen,</hi> in what Country he ever heard, that the whole Burthen was taken off the Poor, and laid on the Rich: Is it not gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the Rich that lay Taxes, and do they not constantly take care not to Overburthen themselves? It is true they are often Chosen by the Poor, but have they not always found out ways to keep them Dependent, either by their Hopes or their Fears? so that they are in effect, at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Rich, tho' they may think themselves ever so much at their own Disposal. But it may be said, all that make Laws are not remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for being great Money'd or great Landed Men; there are many that Improve their own Farms, and live comfortably, but have neither heaps of Cash by them, nor vast Tracts of Land that lye unimproved, so that it would be their Interest, rather to have a Tax levyed in the Manner now proposed, than as it commonly has been. This I am ready to grant, but are these honest industrious Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-Men,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:003363_0011_0FF81AFDD288F308"/>
so practised in the Arts of Persuasion, as those whose time is less innocently employed? Can they expect to be proof against the deep Designs of Men that have all the leisure to contrive, and whose Interest is so high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerned to avoid a heavy Load themselves, and to shuffle it off upon others that are not so sharpsighted? Such Men will leave no Stone un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, to draw in others to be their Tools, even against their own Interest, which may be so disguised, as not to be discerned till the Jobb is over, and then it will be too late to cry, <hi>who would have thought that they were imposing upon us all the while? Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought all they said was Reason! and then, they were so kind and so great with us, one would have Swore we had been Brothers! we never lived so merrily in all our Lives, we thought they were Treating us at free Cost, but now we are like to pay for it: Well! they shall never catch us again.</hi> Such after-thoughts are all the Satisfaction, that generally Well-meaning deluded
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:003363_0012_0FF81AFFD8A73010"/>
People have upon such Occasions.</p>
            <p>But suppose it were possible to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain such a <hi>Tax,</hi> how would it be raised? Would Men generally give in a true Account of their Estates in Cash? I fear the Temptation would be too strong to the contrary: They have found it so in <hi>England</hi> in the Customs, great Numbers of Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities used to be valued according to the Oath of the Importer, and then Rated according to that Value: But the Frauds were so common, that a Custom-House Oath grew into a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb. And lately, as I am inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Parliament has thought fit to put a certain Value upon all these Merchandizes, as the only Remedy to such a general Corruption.</p>
            <p>As to Estates in <hi>Lands,</hi> they might be more easily Assessed, because the Neighbourhood can judge of the Price they would yeild: But then, how often do they know the quantity? How many Thousand Acres may they be mistaken in! the Patents will fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently be no guide to them, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:003363_0013_0FF81B01F50A8D60"/>
a common thing to Possess Ten or twenty Times as much as is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in them. These difficulties in Collecting, besides the little proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of obtaining such a <hi>Tax,</hi> have made me lay aside all Expectation that the <hi>Citizen</hi>'s Proposal will take: And since the <hi>Country-Man</hi> is willing to go along with <hi>him,</hi> as far as <hi>he</hi> can make <hi>his</hi> Words good, it is but fair on the other side, that, if <hi>he</hi> fails in the Success of <hi>his</hi> own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, <hi>he</hi> should take the <hi>Country-Man</hi>'s Scheme once again into Consideration, and see if <hi>he</hi> cannot take up with it, for want of a better.</p>
            <p>And indeed, <hi>they</hi> are already agreed in some of the chief Points, for as the <hi>Citizen</hi> has little to say against <hi>the Duties on</hi> Wine, <hi>and</hi> Negroes <hi>imported, and</hi> Cocoa; so the <hi>Country-Man</hi> will, no doubt, upon <hi>his</hi> own Principles, give up <hi>the Duty upon Goods imported from the Neighbouring Plantations,</hi> since it certainly hinders the Exportation of our own Produce, to Neighbouring Colonies, and is not

of any prejudice to the Trade of <hi>Great Britain</hi> in general; for it is all one to which of the Colonies Goods are sent, if they must be had from thence.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Duty on Salt</hi> has been given up by the <hi>Country-Man</hi> already. And as for <hi>Molassus, he</hi> is not so positive in justifying that <hi>Duty,</hi> but that if a better could be offered in its Room, <hi>he</hi> would give it up. And the <hi>Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen</hi> own's, that the <hi>Pole-Tax on Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes</hi> is by no means to be laid; and yet that is all that has been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in the room of the <hi>other Duties.</hi> So that, till something better is found, the <hi>Duty on Molassus</hi> has more to be said for than against it. I may add another <hi>Duty,</hi> which has not been mentioned by either of them, which ought certainly to be taken off, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is a Discouragement to our own Manufacture, and that is, the <hi>Duty on Spirits Distilled from Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lassus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in this Province.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that now at last, we find the main Dispute, about particular <hi>Duties,</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:003363_0015_0FF81B05D720C2D8"/>
between the <hi>two Authors,</hi> to be only about the <hi>Rum</hi> and the <hi>Tonnage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Rum,</hi> the <hi>Cittizen</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists, <hi>That the Country will have it, cheap or dear</hi>; which is at once an Answer to <hi>his</hi> Apprehension, <hi>That the</hi> Duty <hi>will spoil our Trade with the</hi> West-Indies: And indeed, it never has, for, on the contrary, the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants have imported so much, ever since there has been a <hi>Duty</hi> on it, that they complain, <hi>It has not bore so good a Price as before</hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they alledge, <hi>That they, and not the Country, have always paid the</hi> Duty. Whether this be so or not, is no great Matter; for if the Merchant pays it, then the Country are entirely eased: And if the Country pays it for what Part they take off, they pay it so by little and little, that it is not felt; and the idle drunken Sort pay by much the greater Share.</p>
            <p>It is very true, that We cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be paid for all our Produce, in Money, in the <hi>West-Indies</hi>; but we had better be paid for it in other
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:003363_0016_0FF81B076AA11600"/>
Commodities than in <hi>Rum</hi>; and they would as willingly pay us in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: For <hi>Rum</hi> grows daily in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Demand in <hi>England,</hi> and the Price of it, for that Reason, keeps up in the <hi>West-Indies</hi>; and so they might send most of their <hi>Rum</hi> thither, and give us Bills of Exchange upon <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> for the Value, which will suit them and us, just as well as to bring it hither.</p>
            <p>I have already shewn, <hi>That it is more for our Advantage, to import</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lassus <hi>to be Distilled here</hi>: And I may add, <hi>That we should likewise chuse to import</hi> Sugar, Cotton, Indigo, Cocoa <hi>and</hi> Logwood, which are all proper for to make Returns to <hi>England</hi>; and so we should save so much Money which must otherwise be sent thither: And this is all one with bringing Money for our Produce from the <hi>Islands,</hi> and then sending it to <hi>Great Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, I think, we may see, that the <hi>Country-Man's</hi> Arguments for the <hi>Duty on Rum</hi> remain yet unanswered;
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:003363_0017_0FF81B09DAA88620"/>
and that the <hi>Citizen</hi> ought in all Reason to give up that Point to <hi>him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Tunnage,</hi> the <hi>Citizen</hi> makes one great Concession to the <hi>Country-Man,</hi> which is, <hi>That when that</hi> Duty <hi>is taken off<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Ship-Carpenters, Smiths and other Trades-men, concerned in Ship-Building, will be Sufferers by it</hi>; and the Consequence of that is, That many others, who are now gainers by these <hi>Trades-Men,</hi> will likewise Suffer; and so, by Degrees, we shall find the Loss to be <hi>general</hi>: Besides, that taking away any one Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Sort of Employment, lessens the Demand for People, and so is a Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance to the Province's being well inhabited.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Country-Man</hi> spoke improper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in calling <hi>Bermudians Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi> and their Vessels <hi>Foreign Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels:</hi> But, I believe, <hi>he</hi> does not much mistake in the Argument, tho' <hi>he</hi> may in the Expression: For, I fancy every Inhabitant in this Province, would rather contribute to make <hi>New-York</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:003363_0018_0FF81B0C27F779D0"/>
rich and flourishing than <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudas.</hi> So that if <hi>he</hi> has shown, <hi>that the</hi> Bermudians <hi>will run away with a great Deal of our Money for Freight, which would otherwise remain in the Hands of</hi> Owners <hi>living here,</hi> I think <hi>he</hi> has done enough.</p>
            <p>And here it may be proper to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what is offered by the <hi>Citizen,</hi> on the other side; <hi>That taking off this Duty, will encourage the Exporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Produce; and that in that Case many more Vessels will frequent this Port</hi>; for if this is true, it is a very strong Argument: But it must not be forgot, <hi>That the West-Indies is not an encreasing Market for our Produce: It has for many Years past, taken off about the same Quantity of Flour, Bread, Pork, Bacon, Butter,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and these Commodities are generally at a low Price there: So that it is plain, That the Shipping we now have is enough to carry on that Trade; and therefore it is certain, beyond Contradiction, that all that is carryed on by other Vessels must be so much Employment taken away from
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:003363_0019_0FF80F33AB54A2D8"/>
our own</hi>; and so consequently it is a meer Amusement to tell the People, <hi>That more of their Produce will be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried off, by making the Port open:</hi> For no Body will be so weak, as to carry off more than will sell in the <hi>West-Indies.</hi> And what they bring from thence must, for the same Reason, hinder our own Vessels from bringing away so much as they otherwise would: Because we can take off but such a Quantity of <hi>Rum, Mollassus, Cocoa,</hi> &amp;c. that is to say, as much as we pay for by our Produce, and no more.</p>
            <p>It is true, if we traded frequently to <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> there might be an Advantage, in admitting any Vessels that would sail cheap, to carry our Produce thither; because those are vast Markets, and could not easily be overstocked with Wheat: And for this Reason, it might be proper to take off the <hi>Tunnage</hi> from all Vessels built in <hi>Great Britain,</hi> from which Parts soever they come; because they would generally find <hi>that a Freight from hence to</hi> Lisbon <hi>or</hi> Cadiz, <hi>with
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:003363_0020_0FF81B10A96755B0"/>
Wheat, would be worth their while; having, by that Means, the Opportunity of making another Freight from thence homewards</hi>; which must answer better to Owners living in <hi>England</hi> than to us here; because we run the Risque of coming back empty from <hi>Europe</hi> to this Place, as it often happens e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the direct Trade to <hi>Great Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Citizen</hi> mentions one Instance of a Ship last Year, that went from hence to <hi>Amboy,</hi> for to avoid the <hi>Duty of Tunnage</hi>: But he ought to have owned, that it was likewise to avoid the <hi>Duty on Salt,</hi> which would have come to more than the <hi>Tonnage</hi>; and which <hi>Duty</hi> is agreed on all Hands to be taken off. Besides, as this was <hi>A Brittish built Ship,</hi> the taking off the <hi>Tunnage</hi> of all those Vessels, will answer that Objection fully: For we don't find that the <hi>Bermudians,</hi> who are the only other Vessels who bring <hi>Salt,</hi> ever go to <hi>Amboy,</hi> notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the <hi>Duty on Salt and Tunnage both:</hi> And they often come for a

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> this <hi>Duty</hi> has been so very pernicious, how comes the <hi>Citizen</hi> to bring but <hi>One Instance of a Vessel going to another Port?</hi> Nay! how come we not to hear of <hi>These many Vessels that used to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qent this Port formerly, before the Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage was laid on?</hi> I believe, that Sort of Proof, which would be only to the Purpose, will be very difficult: And this is the Reason of our hearing nothing of it. And till that is made appear, we may take it for granted <hi>That really no more Vessels used to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed here, than now</hi>; But indeed of those that were so, <hi>That fewer were our own, and more belonging to other Provinces.</hi> And if that should be the Case again, and that <hi>People</hi> should throw up their Vessels, finding that <hi>Bermu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> run away with all the Freight, what would follow? <hi>Why</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Bermudas <hi>would be Master of our Trade, and might manage us to their Advantage, and disappoint us as <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:003363_0022_0FF81B13D4090F10"/>The <hi>Citizen</hi> says, <hi>That neighbouring Provinces laugh at us, and get our Trade from us, by Reason of these Duties.</hi> That ouht indeed to put us doubly into ill Humour; to be Losers and Laught at too, is insufferable. By this Account <hi>we</hi> should be growing daily poorer, while <hi>they</hi> are thriving and flourishing. But is this the Case? Is it not well known to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise? Does not our Exchange with <hi>England</hi> hold upon the same Foot, it has been upon for several Years? And are not <hi>Boston, Carolina</hi> and even <hi>Pennsilvania</hi> in a different Case? Is not this a Sign, <hi>That Specie is more plenty here than in any of those Places?</hi> And is not the same thing likewise evident, by the <hi>Quantity of Gold,</hi> that is <hi>here</hi> often taken in Payments? Whereas there is very sesdom such a Thing to be seen among our <hi>Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The only Colonies where the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change is better to <hi>England</hi> than from hence, are <hi>Virginia</hi> and <hi>Maryland</hi>; and there the Government is suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:003363_0023_0FF81B15E0278588"/>
entirely by <hi>Duties on Tobacco.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one, that pretends to talk of Trade, should know that the Rate of <hi>Exchange</hi> is a sure Way of judging of the flourishing or declining State of it, in any place; because that Country that falls in Debt to the other, must be continually paying the Ballance in Money; and that makes a Demand for <hi>Specie</hi> or Bills of <hi>Exchange</hi> to be sent off, to pay that Debt. And therefore when <hi>Boston,</hi> whose Money was made at the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation-value, pays for a Bill of Exchange of One Hundred Pounds Sterling, Three Hundred Pounds of their own Currency, and <hi>Carolina</hi> five or six Hundred Pounds; and <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia</hi> as much, at least, in <hi>Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation-Money,</hi> as we do in Money at <hi>Eight Shillings per Ounce,</hi> which is but <hi>One Hundred and Sixty five per Cent,</hi> it is plain that <hi>we</hi> have the Advantage of them all: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I think the <hi>Country-Man</hi> may here turn the Argument fairly upon the <hi>Other,</hi> and say, <hi>You see what
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:003363_0024_0FF81B1772468390"/>
comes of Land-Taxes in other Provinces! You see that they hurt Trade more, by discouraging Industry, than Duties them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves! And that we act more prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than our Neighbours, in easing the Industrious and the Labourious, and laying the Burthen upon the Idle and the Lazy, and the Expensive.</hi> I fancy those will <hi>laugh with the best Grace that laugh last.</hi> And as long as this Province continues to gain upon her Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, I think she is pretty sure of carrying <hi>The Laugh at the long run.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is reasonable indeed that the <hi>Duties</hi> should only be paid upon so much as is consumed in the Province, and that the Merchant should have the <hi>Duty,</hi> or the greatest Part of it, paid back to him, when he ships off his Goods for another Province; which is called the <hi>Drawback:</hi> This will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly encourage our <hi>Trade</hi> and enable us to supply our <hi>Neighbours,</hi> as cheap as they can supply themselves: Which will entirely answer all the <hi>Citizen's</hi> Fears, <hi>That while we pay Duties, and they none, that they will
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:003363_0025_0FF81B1A8E0E4FF8"/>
run away with the Trade from us.</hi> This is the Method taken in <hi>Great Britain</hi>; and by this Means, while they discourage extravagant Consump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at Home, they contrive to have all Manner of Merchandize pass through them; and in their own Ships to supply all other Nations.</p>
            <p>There have indeed many Cheats been practised, under Pretence of these <hi>Drawbacks</hi>; which will require <hi>great Care in wording the Acts, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Officers to Execute them.</hi> The <hi>Country-Man</hi> proposed to do this by <hi>Store-Houses,</hi> which seems a good Way to prevent <hi>Frauds</hi>; but perhaps would not be so much to the Merchant's Ease and Satisfaction, as this Method of <hi>Drawback</hi>; and this has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready practised here in <hi>Cocoa</hi>; and would be fit to be renewed on that, as well as granted on other Commodities.</p>
            <p>If this Method be taken, then all the Duties will come to be laid to the same End as <hi>an Excise</hi>; which is only a Tax upon Expence: And this is the <hi>Duty</hi> by which that wise

Nation the <hi>Dutch,</hi> raise the greatest Part of their Income. One cannot eat a Dish of Fish, in <hi>Holland,</hi> before it has paid to several Branches of the <hi>Excise.</hi> And if they who live only by <hi>Trade,</hi> think it fittest to lay a <hi>Duty</hi> in this Manner, can we have any Pretence <hi>That it will hurt Trade?</hi> The <hi>Dutch</hi> do it certainly to discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage their People from all needless and excessive Expence; and they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a vastly Rich People, as much by their <hi>Savings</hi> as by their <hi>Gains.</hi> We in this Colony, chiefly, owe our Advantanges above our Neighbours, to the <hi>Frugality of the first Settlers</hi> which they brought from <hi>Holland</hi> with them; it was their <hi>living hard,</hi> and <hi>pinching their Bellies, That enabled them to leave good Houses and well-stockt Farms to their Posterity.</hi> And shall we depart from the sure Maxims of our Ancestors, and run into a course of Luxury and Debauchery, till we lose our Senses and our Estates, meerly to please a few People who set us a bad Example, and will reap
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:003363_0027_0FF81B1F9F93C550"/>
all the Profit of our Folly!</p>
            <p>What is then the design of those who are most Zealous to take off the Duties? Why, it is to be feared, whatever they may pretend, that it is to weaken the Government, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage Justice, and to have all the Power in their own Hands: For ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily, if the poorer Sort have no Refuge to fly to, no Justice to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, they must be entirely at the Discretion of the Rich, and lye wholly at their Mercy. Whereas Courts of Justice, and the Power of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to see the Laws put in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, keep Things in a just Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance and maintain the Publick Peace.</p>
            <p>It is very true, that Governours may likewise abuse their Power: But when they do, we know that the Door is open to all just Complaints, and when there is any Reason for them, they ought to be made in the most publick Manner; and under so Gracious a KING, who rules over so free a Country as <hi>Great Britain,</hi> we need never doubt of Redress.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:003363_0028_0FF81B218DD8FBA0"/>But supposing this Design to distress the Government should prevail again, as it did, not many Years ago, what will be the Consequence? Why! the Mischief of it will soon be found out, the Country will be sensible <hi>That they have been abused and deceived, that they cannot have their Property secured to them without the Protection of the Government; and that they have been drawn in to contract a great, but a necessary Debt, which will come upon them at once to be paid, in the haviest manner, as it lately was.</hi> So that to avoid a few Duties for the Present, which they do not feel, they will entail heavy Land Taxes upon themselves, which neither they, nor perhaps their Children, will have any Hopes to see an End of.</p>
            <p>We may see how unreasonable the common way of laying Taxes upon the Income only, is thought to be, by the sharp Remonstrances from the People of <hi>France</hi> to their King, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a Tax of this kind of <hi>Two per Cent.</hi> only, which have been
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:003363_0029_0FF81B23A02756A8"/>
published in our <hi>News-Papers:</hi> We see their Fears, that the Industry of the People will be Discourag'd, and their Trade ruined by it. If then a Nation under so Absolute a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er as the <hi>French</hi> are, feel it so sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly, as to venture to Complain, in the strongest Manner, tho' they are sure to Smart for it, under the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Displeasure of their Monarch: How much more may we expect, that such <hi>Taxes</hi> will become Odious among a free People, when they come to find the Difference between them and <hi>Duties upon Merchandize!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In fine, I hope all that has been said by the <hi>Country-Man and Citizen</hi> will be duly Considered, and if I have been of Service, in puting <hi>their</hi> Reasons into a plainer Light, for the use of my Neighbours and of the whole Country, of which the City is a part, I shall think my Pains well bestowed.</p>
            <p>And whatever wrong Measures might have prevailed by Surprize, yet now that there has been time given, to
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:003363_0030_0FF81B2560081E78"/>
examine into the Matter at leisure, it is very unlikely, that private Views, and secret Artifices will get the better of the true <hi>Interest of the Country.</hi>
