            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>THERE are an hundred faults in this Thing, and an hundred things might be ſaid to prove them beauties. But it is needleſs. A book may be amuſing with numerous errors, or it may be very dull without a ſingle abſurdity. The hero of this piece unites in himſelf the three greateſt characters upon earth; he is a prieſt, an huſbandman, and the father of a family. He is drawn as ready to teach, and ready to obey, as ſimple in affluence, and majeſtic in adverſity. In this age of opulence and refinement whom can ſuch a character pleaſe? Such as are fond of

                     <head>CHAP. I. The deſcription of the family of Wakefield; in which a kindred likeneſs prevails as well of minds as of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</head>
                     <p>I WAS ever of opinion that the honeſt man who married and brought up a large family, did more ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice than he who continued ſingle, and only talked of population. From this motive, I had ſcarce taken or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders a year, before I began to think ſeriouſly of matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, choſe my wife as ſhe did her wedding gown, not for a fine gloſſy ſurface, but ſuch qualities as would wear well. To do her juſtice, ſhe was a good natured notable woman: and as for breeding, there were few country ladies who at that time could ſhew more. She could read any Engliſh book without much ſpelling, and for pickling, preſerving, and cookery, none could excel her. She prided herſelf much alſo upon being an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent contriver in houſe-keeping; yet I cou'd never find that we grew richer with all her contrivances.</p>
                     <p>However, we loved each other tenderly, and our fondneſs encreaſed with age. There was in fact nothing that could make us angry with the world or each other. We had an elegant houſe, ſituated in a fine country, and a good neighbourhood. The year was ſpent in moral or rural amuſements; in viſiting our rich neighbours, or relieving ſuch as were poor. We had no revolutions to fear, nor fatigues to undergo; all our adventures were by the fire-ſide, and all our migrations from the blue bed to the brown.</p>
                     <p>As we lived near the road, we often had the traveller or ſtranger come to taſte our gooſeberry wine, for which we had great reputation; and I profeſs with the veracity of an hiſtorian, that I never knew one of them find fault with it. Our couſins too even to the fortieth remove,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012405_0005_0F89729BB2DF0A70"/>
all remembred their affinity, without any help from the Herald's office, and came very frequently to ſee us. Some of them did us no great honour by theſe claims of kindred; for literally ſpeaking we had the blind, the maimed, and halt amongſt the number. However, my wife always inſiſted that as they were the ſame <hi>fleſh and blood,</hi> with us, they ſhould ſit with us at the ſame table. So that if we had not very rich, we generally had very happy friends about us; for this remark will hold good thro' life, that the poorer the gueſt, the better pleaſed he ever is with being treated: and as ſome men gaze with admiration at the colours of a tulip, and others are ſmitten with the wings of a butterfly, ſo I was by nature an admirer of happy human faces. However, when any one of our relations was found to be a perſon of very bad character, a troubleſome gueſt, or one we deſired to get rid of, upon his leaving my houſe for the firſt time, I ever took care to lend him a riding coat, or a pair of boots, or ſometimes an horſe of ſmall value, and I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways had the ſatiſfaction of finding he never came back to re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> them. By this the houſe was cleared of ſuch as we did not like; but never was the family of Wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field known to turn the traveller or the poor dependant out of doors.</p>
                     <p>Thus we lived ſeveral years in a ſtate of much happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, not but that we ſometimes had thoſe little rubs which Providence ſends to enhance the value of its fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. My orchard was often robbed by ſchool-boys, and my wife's cuſtards plundered by the cats or the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. The 'Squire would ſometimes fall aſleep in the moſt pathetic parts of my ſermon, or his lady return my wife's civilities at church with a mutilated curteſy. But we ſoon got over the uneaſineſs cauſed by ſuch accidents, and uſually in three or four days we began to wonder how they vext us.</p>
                     <p>My children, the offspring of temperance, as they were educated without ſoftneſs, ſo they were at once well formed and healthy; my ſons hardy and active, my daughters dutiful and blooming. When I ſtood in the midſt of the little circle which promiſed to be the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of my declining age, I could not avoid repeating the famous ſtory of Count Abenſberg, who, in Henry
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012405_0006_0F89729C771AA8B0"/>
II's progreſs through Germany, when other courtiers came with their treaſures, brought his thirty two chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and preſented them to his ſovereign as the moſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable offering he had to beſtow. In this manner, though I had but ſix, I conſidered them as a very valuable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent made to my country, and conſequently looked upon it as my debtor. Our eldeſt ſon was named George, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his uncle, who left us ten thouſand pounds. Our ſecond child, a girl, I intended to call after her aunt Griſſel; but my wife, who during her pregnancy had been reading romances, inſiſted upon her being called Olivia. In leſs than another year we had a daughter again, and now I was determined that Griſſel ſhould be her name; but a rich relation taking a fancy to ſtand godmother, the girl was, by her directions, called So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia; ſo that we had two romantic names in the family; but I ſolemnly proteſt I had no hand in it. Moſes was our next, and after an interval of twelve years, we had two ſons more.</p>
                     <p>It would be fruitleſs to deny my exultation when I ſaw my little ones about me; but the vanity and the ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my wife were even greater than mine. When our viſitors would uſually ſay,
<q>Well, upon my word, Mrs. Primroſe, you have the fineſt children in the whole country.</q>
—"Ay, neighbour," ſhe would anſwer,
<q>they are as heaven made them, handſome enough, if they be good, enough; for handſome is that handſome does.</q> And then ſhe would bid the girls hold up their heads; who, to conceal nothing, were certainly very handſome. Mere outſide is ſo very trifling a circumſtance with me, that I ſhould ſcarce have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered to mention it, had it not been a general topic of converſation in the country. Olivia, now about eighteen, had that luxuriancy of beauty with which painters have generally drawn Hebe; open, ſprightly, and commanding. Sophia's features were not ſo ſtriking at firſt; but often did more certain execution; for they were ſoft, modeſt, and alluring. The one vanquiſhed by a ſingle blow, the other by efforts ſucceſſively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated.</p>
                     <p>The temper of a woman is generally formed from the turn of her features, at leaſt it was ſo with my daughters.
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012405_0007_0F89729D32165B70"/>
Olivia wiſhed for many lovers, Sophia to ſecure one. Olivia was often affected from too great a deſire to pleaſe. Sophia even repreſt excellence from her ſears to offend. The one entertained me with her vivacity when I was gay, the other with her ſenſe when I was ſerious. But theſe qualities were never carried to exceſs in either, and I have often ſeen them exchange characters for a whole day together. A ſuit of mourning has transform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my coquet into a prude, and a new ſet of ribbands given her younger ſiſter more than natural vivacity. My eldeſt ſon George was bred at Oxford, as I intended him for one of the learned profeſſions. My ſecond boy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, whom I deſigned for buſineſs, received a ſort of miſcellaneous education at home. But it would be needleſs to attempt deſcribing the particular characters of young people that had ſeen but very little of the world. In ſhort, a family likeneſs prevailed through all, and, properly ſpeaking, they had but one character, that of being all equally generous, credulous, ſimple, and inof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive.</p>

                     <p>THE temporal concerns of our family were chiefly committed to my wife's management, as to the ſpiritual, I took them entirely under my own direction. The profits of my living, which amounted to but thirty- five pounds a year, I gave to the orphans and widows of the clergy of our dioceſe; for having a ſufficient fortune of my own, I was careleſs of temporalities, and felt a ſecret pleaſure in doing my duty without reward.

<pb n="9" facs="unknown:012405_0008_0F89729EB9765B90"/>
wanting pride, young men wanting wives, and ale-houſes wanting cuſtomers.</p>
                     <p>Matrimony was always one of my favourite topics, and I wrote ſeveral ſermons to prove its utility and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs: but there was a peculiar tenet which I made a point of ſupporting; for I maintained with Whiſton, that it was unlawful for a prieſt of the church of England, after the death of his firſt wife, to take a ſecond, or, to expreſs it in one word, I valued myſelf upon being a ſtrict monogamiſt.</p>
                     <p>I was early initiated into this important diſpute, on which ſo many laborious volumes have been written. I publiſhed ſome tracts upon the ſubject myſelf, which, as they never ſold, I have the conſolation of thinking are read only by the happy <hi>Few.</hi> Some of my friends called this my weak ſide; but alas! they had not like me made it the ſubject of long contemplation. The more I reflected upon it, the more important it appeared. I even went a ſtep beyond Whiſton in diſplaying my principles: as he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven upon his wife's tomb, that ſhe was the <hi>only</hi> wife of William Whiſton; ſo I wrote a ſimilar epitaph for my wife, tho' ſtill living, in which I extolled her prudence, oeconomy and obedience till death; and having got it copied fair, with an elegant frame, it was placed over the chimney-piece, where it anſwered ſeveral very uſeful purpoſes. It admoniſhed my wife of her duty to me, and my fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to her; it inſpired her with a paſſion for fame, and conſtantly put her in mind of her end.</p>
                     <p>It was thus, perhaps, from hearing marriage ſo often recommended, that my eldeſt ſon, juſt upon leaving college, fixed his affections upon the daughter of a neighbouring clergyman, who was a dignitary in the church, and in circumſtances to give her a large fortune: but fortune was her ſmalleſt accompliſhment. Miſs Arabella Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mot was allowed of all, except my two daughters, to be completely pretty. Her youth, health, and innocence, were ſtill heightened by a complexion ſo tranſparent, and ſuch an happy ſenſibility of look, that even age could not gaze with indifference. As Mr. Wilmot knew that I could make a very handſome ſettlement on my ſon, he was not averſe to the match; ſo both families lived to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in all that harmony which generally precedes an
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:012405_0009_0F89729FC00668A0"/>
expected alliance. Being convinced by experience that the days of courtſhip are the moſt happy of our lives, I was willing enough to lengthen the period; and the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious amuſements which the young couple every day ſhared in each other's company, ſeemed to encreaſe their paſſion. We were generally awakened in the morning by muſic, and on fine days rode a hunting. The hours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween breakfaſt and dinner, the ladies devoted to dreſs and ſtudy: they uſually read a page, and then gazed at themſelves in the glaſs, which even philoſophers might own, often preſented the page of greateſt beauty. At dinner my wife took the lead; for as ſhe always inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon carving every thing herſelf, it being her mother's way, ſhe gave us upon theſe occaſions the hiſtory of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſh. When we had dined, to prevent the ladies leaving us, I generally ordered the table to be removed; and ſometimes, with the muſic maſter's aſſiſtance, the girls would give us a very agreeable concert. Walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, drinking tea, country dances, and forfeits, ſhortened the reſt of the day, without the aſſiſtance of cards, as I hated all manner of gaming, except back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gammon, at which my old friend and I ſometimes took a two-penny hit. Nor can I here paſs over an ominous circumſtance that happened the laſt time we played toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I only wanted to fling a quatre, and yet I threw deuce ace five times running.</p>
                     <p>Some months were elapſed in this manner, till at laſt it was thought convenient to fix a day for the nuptials of the young couple, who ſeemed earneſtly to deſire it. During the preparations for the wedding, I need not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the buſy importance of my wife, nor the ſly looks of my daughters: in fact, my attention was fixed on another object, the completing a tract which I intended ſhortly to publiſh in defence of monogamy. As I looked upon this as a maſter piece both for argument and ſtyle, I could not in the pride of my heart avoid ſhewing it to my old friend Mr. Wilmot, as I made no doubt of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving his approbation: but too late I diſcovered that he was moſt violently attached to the contrary opinion, and with good reaſon; for he was at that time actually courting a fourth wife. This, as may be expected, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a diſpute attended with ſome acrimony, which
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:012405_0010_0F8972A0357739B0"/>
threatened to interrupt our intended alliance: but on the day before that appointed for the ceremony, we agreed to diſcuſs the ſubject at large.</p>
                     <p>It was managed with proper ſpirit on both ſides: he aſſerted that I was heterodox. I retorted the charge: he replied, and I rejoined. In the mean time, while the controverſy was hotteſt, I was called out by one of my relations, who, with a face of concern, adviſed me to give up the diſpute, and allow the old gentlemen to be a huſband, if he could, at leaſt till my ſon's wedding was over. "How," cried I,
<q>relinquiſh the cauſe of truth, and let him be an huſband, already driven to the very verge of abſurdity. You might as well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe me to give up my fortune as my argument.</q> "That fortune," returned my friend,
<q>I am now ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to inform you is almoſt nothing. Your merchant in town, in whoſe hands your money was lodged, has gone off, to avoid a ſtatute of bankruptcy, and it is thought has not left a ſhilling in the pound. I was unwilling to ſhock you or the family with the account till after the wedding: but now it may ſerve to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate your warmth in the argument; for, I ſuppoſe, your own prudence will enforce the neceſſity of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling, at leaſt, till your ſon has the young lady's fortune ſecured.</q>
—"Well," returned I,
<q>if what you tell me be true, and if I am to be a beggar, it ſhall never make me a raſcal, or induce me to diſavow my principles. I'll go this moment and inform the company of my circumſtances; and as for the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I even here retract my former conceſſions in the old gentleman's favour, nor will I allow him now to be an huſband either de jure, de facto, or in any ſenſe of the expreſſion.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>It would be endleſs to deſcribe the different ſenſations of both families when I divulged the news of my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes; but what others felt was ſlight to what the young lovers appeared to endure. Mr. Wilmot, who ſeemed before ſufficiently inclined to break off the match, was by this blow ſoon determined: one virtue he had in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which was prudence, too often the only virtue that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <head>CHAP. III. A migration. The fortunate circumſtances of our lives are generally found at laſt to be of our own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing.</head>
                     <p>THE only hope of our family now was, that the report of our miſfortunes might be malicious or premature: but a letter from my agent in town ſoon came with a confirmation of every particular. The loſs of fortune to myſelf alone would have been trifling; the only uneaſineſs I felt, was for my family, who were to be humble without ſuch an education as could render them callous to contempt.</p>
                     <p>Near a fortnight paſſed away before I attempted to reſtrain their affliction; for premature conſolation is but the remembrance of ſorrow. During this interval my thoughts were employed on ſome future means of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting them; and at laſt a ſmall Cure of fifteen pounds a year was offered me in a diſtant neighbourhood, where I could ſtill enjoy my principles without moleſtation. With this propoſal I joyfully cloſed, having determined to encreaſe my ſalary by managing a little farm.</p>
                     <p>Having taken this reſolution, my next care was to get together the wrecks of my fortune; and all debts col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and paid, out of fourteen thouſand pounds we had now but four hundred remaining. My chief attention therefore, was next to bring down the pride of my fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to their circumſtances; for I well knew that aſpiring beggary is wretchedneſs itſelf.
<q>You can't be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, my children,</q>
cried I,
<q>that no prudence of ours could have prevented our late misfortune; but prudence may do much in diſappointing its effects. We are now poor, my fondlings, and wiſdom bids us conform to our humble ſituation. Let us then, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repining, give up theſe ſplendours with which numbers are wretched, and ſeek in humbler circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that peace with which all may be happy. The poor live pleaſantly without our help, and we are not ſo imperfectly formed as to be incapable o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

living without theirs. No, my children, let us from this moment give up all pretenſions to gentility; we have ſtill enough left for happineſs, if we are wiſe, and let us draw upon content for the deficiencies of fortune.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>As my eldeſt ſon was bred a ſcholar, I determined to ſend him to town, where his abilities might contribute to our ſupport and his own. The ſeparation of friends and families is, perhaps, one of the moſt diſtreſsful cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances attendant on penury. The day ſoon arrived on which we were to diſperſe for the firſt time. My ſon, after taking leave of his mother and the reſt, who ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led their tears with their kiſſes, came to aſk a bleſſing from me. This I gave him from my heart, and which, added to five guineas, was all the patrimony I had now to beſtow. "You are going, my boy," cried I,
<q>to London on foot, in the manner Hooker, your great anceſtor, travelled there before you. Take from me the ſame horſe that was given him by the good biſhop Jewel, this ſtaff, and take this book too, it will be your comfort on the way: theſe two lines in it are worth a million, <hi>I have been young, and now am old; yet never ſaw I the righteous man forſaken, or his ſeed beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging their bread.</hi> Let this be your conſolation as you travel on. Go, my boy, whatever be thy fortune let me ſee thee once a year; ſtill keep a good heart, and farewell.</q>
As he was poſſeſt of integrity and honour, I was under no apprehenſions from throwing him naked into the amphitheatre of life; for I knew he would act a good part whether he roſe or fell.</p>
                     <p>His departure only prepared the way for our own, which arrived a few days afterwards. The leaving a neighbourhood in which we had enjoyed ſo many hours of tranquillity, was not without a tear, which ſcarce for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude itſelf could ſuppreſs. Beſides, a journey of ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty miles to a family that had hitherto never been above ten from home, filled us with apprehenſion, and the cries of the poor, who followed us for ſome miles, contributed to encreaſe it. The firſt day's journey brought us in ſafety within thirty miles of our future retreat, and we put up for the night at an obſcure inn in a village by the way. When we were ſhewn a room, I deſired the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:012405_0013_0F8972A272F11B70"/>
in my uſual way, to let us have his company, with which he complied, as what he drank would encreaſe the bill next morning. He knew, however, the whole neighbourhood to which I was removing, particularly 'Squire Thornhill, who was to be my landlord, and who lived within a few miles of the place. This gentleman he deſcribed, as one who deſired to know little more of the world than the pleaſures it afforded, being particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly remarkable for his attachment to the fair ſex. He obſerved that no virtue was able to reſiſt his arts and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duity, and that ſcarce a farmer's daughter within ten miles round, but what had found him ſucceſsful and faithleſs. Though this account gave me ſome pain, it had a very different effect upon my daughters, whoſe features ſeemed to brighten with the expectation of an approaching triumph, nor was my wife leſs pleaſed and confident of their allurements and virtue. While our thoughts were thus employed, the hoſteſs entered the room to inform her huſband that the ſtrange gentleman, who had been two days in the houſe, wanted money, and could not ſatisfy them for his reckoning.
<q>Want mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney!</q>
replied the hoſt,
<q>that muſt be impoſſible; for it was no later than yeſterday he paid three gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas to our beadle to ſpare an old broken ſoldier that was to be whipped through the town for dog-ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</q> The hoſteſs, however, ſtill perſiſting in her firſt aſſertion, he was preparing to leave the room, ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he would be ſatisfied one way or another, when I begged the landlord would introduce me to a ſtranger of ſo much charity as he deſcribed. With this he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, ſhewing in a gentleman who ſeemed to be about thirty, dreſt in cloaths that once were laced. His per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was well formed, though his face was marked with the lines of thinking. He had ſomething ſhort and dry in his addreſs, and ſeemed not to underſtand ceremony, or to deſpiſe it. Upon the landlord's leaving the room, I could not avoid expreſſing my concern to the ſtranger, at ſeeing a gentleman in ſuch circumſtances, and offered him my purſe to ſatisfy the preſent demand.
<q>I take it with all my heart, Sir,</q>
replied he,
<q>and am glad that a late overſight in giving what money I had about me, has ſhewn me that there is ſtill ſome benevolence
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:012405_0014_0F8972A333F82748"/>
left among us. I muſt, however, previouſly entreat being informed of the name and reſidence of my bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, in order to remit it as ſoon as poſſible.</q>
In this I ſatisfied him fully, not only mentioning my name and late misfortunes, but the place to which I was going to remove. "This" cried he,
<q>happens ſtill more luckily than I hoped for, as I am going the ſame way myſelf, having been detained here two days by the floods, which, I hope, by to morrow will be found paſſable.</q>
I teſtified the pleaſure I ſhould have in his company, and my wife and daughters joining in entreaty, he was prevailed upon to ſtay to ſupper. The ſtranger's converſation, which was at once pleaſing and inſtructive induced me to wiſh for a continuance of it; but it was now high time to retire and take refreſhment againſt the fatigues of the following day.</p>
                     <p>The next morning we all ſet forward together: my family on horſeback, while Mr. Burchel, our new com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, walked along the foot-path by the road-ſide, obſerving, with a ſmile, that as we were ill mounted, he would be too generous to attempt leaving us behind. As the floods were not yet ſubſided, we were obliged to hire a guide, who trotted on before, Mr. Burchel and I bringing up the rear. We lightened the fatigues of the road with philoſophical diſputes, which he ſeemed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly to underſtand. But what ſurpriſed me moſt was, that though he was a money borrower, he defended his opinions with as much obſtinacy as if he had been my patron. He now and then alſo informed me to whom the different ſeats belonged that lay in our view, as we travelled the road. "That," cried he, pointing to a very magnificent houſe which ſtood at ſome diſtance,
<q>belongs to Mr. Thornhill, a young gentleman who enjoys a large fortune, though entirely dependant on the will of his uncle, Sir William Thornhill, a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who content with a little himſelf, permits his nephew to enjoy the reſt, and chiefly reſides in town.</q>
"What!" cried I,
<q>is my young landlord then the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew of a man whoſe virtues, generoſity, and ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities are ſo univerſally known? I have heard Sir William Thornhill repreſented as one of the moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous, yet whimſical, men in the kingdom; a man
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:012405_0015_0F8972A3F2D79830"/>
of conſummate benevolence.</q>
—Something, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, too much ſo, replied Mr. Burchel,
<q>at leaſt he carried benevolence to an exceſs when young; for his paſſions were then ſtrong, and as they all were upon the ſide of virtue, they led it up to a romantic ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme. He early began to aim at the qualifications of the ſoldier and ſcholar; was ſoon diſtinguiſhed in the army, and had ſome reputation among men of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Adulation ever follows the ambitious; for ſuch alone receive moſt pleaſure from flattery. He was ſurrounded with crowds, who ſhewed him only one ſide of their character; ſo that he began to loſe a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for private intereſt in univerſal ſympathy. He loved all mankind; for fortune prevented him from knowing that there were raſcals. Phyſicians tell us of a diſorder in which the whole body is ſo exquiſitely ſenſible, that the ſlighteſt touch gives pain: what ſome have thus ſuffered in their perſons, this gentleman felt in his mind. The ſlighteſt diſtreſs, whether real or fictitious, touched him to the quick, and his ſoul la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured under a fickle ſenſibility of the miſeries of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Thus diſpoſed to relieve, it will be eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured, he found numbers diſpoſed to ſolicit: his profuſions began to impair his fortune, but not his good-nature; that, indeed, was ſeen to encreaſe as the other ſeemed to decay; he grew improvident as he grew poor; and though he talked like a man of ſenſe, his actions were thoſe of a fool. Still, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, being ſurrounded with importunity, and no longer able to ſatisfy every requeſt that was made him, inſtead of <hi>money</hi> he gave <hi>promiſes.</hi> They were all he had to beſtow, and he had not reſolution enough to give any man pain by a denial. By this means he drew round him crowds of dependants, whom he was ſure to diſappoint; yet wiſhed to relieve. Theſe hung upon him for a time, and left him with merited reproaches and contempt. But in proportion as he became contemptible to others, he became deſpicable to himſelf. His mind had leaned upon their adulation, and that ſupport taken away, he could find no pleaſure in the applauſe of his heart, which he had never learnt to reverence itſelf. The world now began to wear
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:012405_0016_0F8972A4B56B2FA8"/>
a different aſpect; the flattery of his friends began to dwindle into ſimple approbation, that ſoon took the more friendly form of advice, and advice when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected ever begets reproaches. He now found that ſuch friends as benefits hath gathered round him were by no means the moſt eſtimable: it was now found that a man's own heart muſt be ever given to gain that of another. I now found, that—but I forget what I was going to obſerve: in ſhort, Sir, he reſolved to reſpect himſelf, and laid down a plan of reſtoring his ſhattered fortune. For this purpoſe, in his own whimſical manner he travelled through Europe on foot, and before he attained the age of thirty, his circumſtances were more affluent than ever. At pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, therefore, his bounties are more rational and moderate than before; but ſtill he preſerves the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of an humouriſt, and finds moſt pleaſure in ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centric virtues.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>My attention was ſo much taken up by Mr. Burchel's account, that I ſcarce looked forward as we went along, till we were alarmed by the cries of my family, when turning. I perceived my youngeſt daughter in the midſt of a rapid ſtream, thrown from her horſe, and ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling with the torrent. She had ſunk twice, nor was it in my power to diſengage myſelf in time to bring her relief. My ſenſations were even too violent to permit my attempting her reſcue; ſhe would have certainly periſhed had not my companion, perceiving her danger, inſtantly plunged in to her relief, and, with ſome difficulty, brought her in ſafety to the oppoſite ſhore. By taking the current a little farther up; the reſt of the family got ſafely over; where we had an opportunity of joining our acknowledgments to her's. Her gratitude may be more readily imagined than deſcribed: ſhe thanked her deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer more with looks than words, and continued to lean upon his arm, as if ſtill willing to receive aſſiſtance. My wife alſo hoped one day to have the pleaſure of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning his kindneſs at her own houſe. Thus, after we were all refreſhed at the next inn, and had dined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as he was going to a different part of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, he took leave; and we purſued our journey. My wife obſerving as we went, that ſhe liked Mr. Burchel
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:012405_0017_0F8972A573919578"/>
extremely, and proteſting, that if he had birth and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to entitle him to match into ſuch a family as our's, ſhe knew no man ſhe would ſooner fix upon. I could not but ſmile to hear her talk in this ſtrain: one almoſt at the verge of beggary thus to aſſume language of the moſt inſulting affluence, might excite the ridicule of ill- nature; but I was never much diſpleaſed with thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent deluſions that tend to make us more happy.</p>

                     <p>THE place of our new retreat was in a little neighbourhood, conſiſting of farmers, who tilled their own grounds, and were equal ſtrangers to opulence and poverty. As they had almoſt all the conveniences of life within themſelves, they ſeldom viſited towns or cities in ſearch of ſuperfluity. Remote from the polite, they ſtill retained a primaeval ſimplicity of manners, and frugal by long habit, ſcarce knew that temperance was a virtue. They wrought with chearfulneſs on days of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; but obſerved feſtivals as intervals of idleneſs and pleaſure. They kept up the Chriſtmas carol, ſent true love-knots on Valentine morning, eat pancakes on Shrove-tide, ſhewed their wit on the firſt of April, and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly cracked nuts on Allhollow eve. Being apprized of our approach, the whole neighbourhood came out to meet their miniſter, dreſt in their fineſt cloaths, and preceded by a pipe and tabor: alſo a feaſt was provided for our reception, at which we ſat chearfully down; and what the converſation wanted in wit, we made up in laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p>Our little habitation was ſituated at the foot of a ſlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping hill, ſheltered with a beautiful underwood behind, and a pratling river before; on one ſide a meadow, on
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:012405_0018_0F8972A6336BBA10"/>
the other a green. My farm conſiſted of about twenty acres of excellent land, having given an hundred pounds for my predeceſſor's good-will. Nothing could exceed the neatneſs of my little encloſures: the elms and hedge rows appearing with inexpreſſible beauty. My houſe conſiſted of but one ſtory, and was covered with thatch, which gave it an air of great ſnugneſs: the walls on the inſide were nicely white-waſhed, and my daughters un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to adorn them with pictures of their own deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Though the ſame room ſerved us for parlour and kitchen, that only made it the warmer. Beſides, as it was kept with the utmoſt neatneſs, the diſhes, plates, and coppers, being well ſcoured, and all diſpoſed in bright rows on the ſhelves, the eye was agreeably relieved, and did not ſeem to want rich furniture. There were three other apartments, one for my wife and me, another for our two daughters, within our own, and the third, with two beds, for the reſt of my children.</p>
                     <p>The little republic to which I gave laws, was regulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the following manner; by ſun-riſe we all aſſembled in our common apartment: the fire being previouſly kindled by the ſervant. After we had ſaluted each other with proper ceremony, for I always thought fit to keep up ſome mechanical forms of good breeding, without which, freedom ever deſtroys friendſhip, we all bent in gratitude to that Being who gave us another day. This duty being performed, my ſon and I went to purſue our uſual induſtry, while my wife and daughters employed themſelves in providing breakfaſt, which was always rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy at a certain time. I allowed half an hour for this meal, and an hour for dinner; which time was taken up in innocent mirth between my wife and daughters, and in philoſophical arguments between my ſon and me.</p>
                     <p>As we roſe with the ſun, ſo we never purſued our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours after it was gone down, but returned home to the expecting family, where ſmiling looks, a neat hearth, and pleaſant fire, were prepared for our reception. Nor were we without other gueſts: ſometimes farmer Flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough, our talkative neighbour, and often the blind piper, would pay us a viſit, and taſte our gooſeberry wine; for the making of which we had loſt neither the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:012405_0019_0F8972A81A3E52A0"/>
receipt nor the reputation. Theſe harmleſs people had ſeveral ways of being good company, while one played the pipes, another would ſing ſome ſoothing ballad, Jonny Armſtrong's laſt good night, or the cruelty of Barbara Allen. The night was concluded in the manner we began the morning, my youngeſt boys being appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to read the leſſons of the day, and he that read loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, diſtincteſt, and beſt, was to have an halfpenny on Sunday to put in the poor's box.</p>
                     <p>When ſunday came it was indeed a day of finery, which all my ſumptuary edicts could not reſtrain. How well ſoever I fancied my lectures againſt pride had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered the vanity of my daughters: yet I ſtill found them ſecretly attached to all their former finery: they ſtill loved laces, ribbands, bugles and catgut; my wife herſelf retained a paſſion for her crimſon paduaſoy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I formerly happened to ſay it became her.</p>
                     <p>The firſt ſunday in particular their behaviour ſerved to mortify me: I had deſired my girls the preceding night to be dreſt early the next day; for I always loved to be at church a good while before the reſt of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation. They punctually obeyed my directions; but when we were to aſſemble in the morning at breakfaſt, down came my wife and daughters, dreſt out in all their former ſplendour: their hair plaiſtered up with poma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, their faces patched to taſte, their trains bundled up into an heap behind, and ruſtling at every motion. I could not help ſmiling at their vanity, particularly that of my wife, from whom I expected more diſcretion. In this exigence, therefore, my only reſource was to order my ſon, with an important air, to call our coach. The girls were amazed at the command; but I repeated it with more ſolemnity than before.—
<q>Surely, my dear, you jeſt,</q>
cried my wife,
<q>we can walk it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly well: we want no coach to carry us now</q>
"You miſtake, child," returned I,
<q>we do want a coach; for if we walk to church in this trim, the very children in the pariſh will hoot after us for a ſhew.</q>
—Indeed, replied my wife,
<q>I always imagined that my Charles was fond of ſeeing his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren neat and handſome about him.</q> —
<q>You may be as neat as you pleaſe,</q>
interrupted I,
<q>and
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:012405_0020_0F8972A873590500"/>
I ſhall love you the better for it; but all this is not neatneſs, but frippery. Theſe rufflings, and pink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and patchings, will only make us hated by all the wives of all our neighbours. No, my children,</q>

<q>thoſe gowns may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into ſomething of a plainer cut; for finery is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unbecoming in us, who want the means of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency.

                     </p>
                     <p>This remonſtrance had the proper effect: they went with great compoſure, that very inſtant, to change their dreſs; and the next day I had the ſatisfaction of finding my daughters, at their own requeſt, employed in cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up their trains into Sunday waiſtcoats for Dick and Bill, the two little ones, and what was ſtill more ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory, the gowns ſeemed improved by being thus cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed.</p>

                     <p>AT a ſmall diſtance from the houſe my predeceſſor had made a ſeat, over-ſhaded by an hedge of haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn, and honeyſuckle. Here when the weather was fine, and our labour ſoon finiſhed, we uſually all ſat to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to enjoy an extenſive landſcape in the calm of the evening. Here too we drank tea, which now was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an occaſional banquet; and as we had it but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, it diffuſſed a new joy, the preparations for it being made with no ſmall ſhare of buſtle and ceremony. On theſe occaſions, our two little ones always read for us, and they were regularly ſerved after we had done. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:012405_0021_0F8972A9349E46A0"/>
to give a variety to our amuſements, the girls fung to the guitar; and while they thus formed a little concert, my wife and I would ſtroll down the ſloping field, that was embelliſhed with blue bells and centaury, talk of our children with rapture, and enjoy the breeze that waſted both health and harmony.</p>
                     <p>In this manner we began to find that every ſituation in life might bring its own peculiar pleaſures: every morning waked us to a repetition of toil; but the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing repaid it with vacant hilarity.</p>
                     <p>It was about the beginning of autumn, on a holiday, for I kept ſuch as intervals of relaxation from labour, that I had drawn out my family to our uſual place of amuſement, and our young muſicians began their uſual concert, as we were thus engaged, we ſaw a ſtag bound nimbly by, within about twenty paces of where we were ſitting, and by its panting, it ſeemed preſt by the hunters. We had not much time to reflect upon the poor animal's diſtreſs, when we perceived the dogs and horſemen come ſweeping along at ſome diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, and making the very path it had taken. I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly for returning in with my family, but either cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity or ſurpriſe, or ſome more hidden motive, held my wife and daughters to their ſeats. The huntſman who rode foremoſt, paſt us with great ſwiftneſs, followed by four or five perſons more, who ſeemed in equal haſte. At laſt a young gentleman of a more genteel appearance than the reſt came forward, and for a while regarding us, inſtead of purſuing the chace, ſtopt ſhort, and giving his horſe to a ſervant who attended, approached us with a careleſs ſuperior air. He ſemeed to want no introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but was going to ſalute my daughters as one certain of a kind reception; but they had early learnt the leſſon of looking preſumption out of countenance. Upon which he let us know that his name was Thornhill, and that he was owner of the eſtate that lay for ſome extent round us. He again, therefore, offered to ſalute the female part of the family, and ſuch was the power of fortune and fine cloaths, that he found no ſecond repulſe. As his addreſs, though confident, was eaſy, we ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more familiar; and perceiving muſical inſtruments lying near, he begged to be favoured with a a ſong. As I
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:012405_0022_0F8972A9F4E02200"/>
did not approve of ſuch diſproportioned acquaintances, I winked upon my daughters, in order to prevent their compliance; but my hint was counteracted by one from their mother; ſo that with a chearful air they gave us a favourite ſong of Dryden's. Mr. Thornhill ſeemed high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delighted with their performance and choice, and then took up the guitar himſelf. He played but indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently; however, my eldeſt daughter repaid his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer applauſe with intereſt, and aſſured him that his tones were louder than even thoſe of her maſter. At this compliment he bowed, which ſhe returned with a curteſy. He praiſed her taſte, and ſhe commended his underſtanding: an age could not have made them better acquainted. While the fond mother too, equally hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, inſiſted upon her landlord's ſtepping in, and taſting a glaſs of her gooſeberry. The whole family ſeemed earneſt to pleaſe him: my girls attempted to entertain him with topics they thought moſt modern, while Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes on the contrary, gave him a queſtion or two from the ancients, for which he had the ſatisfaction of being laughed at; for he always aſcribed to his wit that laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which was laviſhed at his ſimplicity: my little ones were no leſs buſy, and fondly ſtuck cloſe to the ſtranger. All my endeavours could ſcarce keep their fingers from handling and tarniſhing the lace on his cloaths, and lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the flaps of his pocket holes, to ſee what was there. At the approach of evening he took his leave; but not till he had requeſted permiſſion to renew his viſit, which, as he was our landlord, we moſt readily agreed to.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as he was gone, my wife called a council on the conduct of the day. She was of opinion that it was a moſt fortunate hit; for that ſhe had known even ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger things at laſt brought to bear. She hoped again to ſee the day in which we might hold up our heads with the beſt of them; and concluded, ſhe proteſted ſhe could ſee no reaſon why the two Miſs Wrinkles ſhould marry great fortunes, and her children get none. As this laſt argument was directed to me, I proteſted I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ould ſee no reaſon for it neither, nor why one got the ten thouſand pound prize in the lottery, and another ſat down with a blank. "But thoſe," added I,
<q>who either aim at

huſbands greater than themſelves, or at the ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pound prize, have been fools for their ridiculous claims, whether ſucceſsful or not.</q>
                        <q>I proteſt, Charles,</q>
cried my wife,
<q>this is the way you always damp my girls and me, when we are in ſpirits. Tell me Sophy, my dear, what do you think of our new viſitor? Don't you think he ſeemed to be good-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured?</q>
—"Immenſely ſo, indeed, Mamma," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied ſhe.
<q>I think he has a great deal to ſay upon every thing, and is never at a loſs; and the more trifling the ſubject, the more he has to ſay; and what is more, I proteſt he is very handſome.</q>
—"Yes," cried Oliva,
<q>he is well enough for a man; but, for my part, I don't much like him, he is ſo extremely impudent and familiar, but on the guitar he is ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</q>
Theſe two laſt ſpeeches I interpreted by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries. I found by this, that Sophia internally deſpiſed, as much as Olivia ſecretly admired him.—
<q>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be your opinions of him, my children,</q>
cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I,
<q>to confeſs a truth, he has not prepoſſeſt me in his favour. Diſproportioned friendſhips ever termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in diſguſt; and I thought notwithſtanding all his caſe that he ſeemed perfectly ſenſible of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance between us. Let us keep to companions of our own rank. There is no character among men more contemptible than that of a fortune hunter, and I can ſee no reaſon why fortune-hunting women ſhould not be contemptible too. Thus, at beſt, it will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt if his views are honourable; but if they are otherwiſe! I ſhould ſhudder but to think of that; for though I have no apprehenſions from the conduct of my children, I think there are ſome from his charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</q> —I would have proceeded, but for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption of a ſervant from the 'Squire, who with his compliments, ſent us a ſide of veniſon and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to dine with us ſome days after. This well-timed preſent pleaded more powerfully in his ſavour, than any thing I had to ſay could obviate. I therefore continued ſilent, ſatisfied with juſt having pointed out danger, and leaving it to their own diſcretion to avoid it. That vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue which requires to be ever guarded, is ſcarce worth the centinel.</p>

                     <p>AS we carried on the former diſpute with ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of warmth, in order to accommodate matters it was univerſally concluded upon, that we ſhould have a part of the veniſon for ſupper, and the girls undertook the taſk with alacrity. "I am ſorry," cried I,
<q>that we have no neighbour or ſtranger to take a part in this good cheer: feaſts of this kind acquire a double reliſh from hoſpitality.</q> —
<q>Bleſs me, cried my wife, here comes our good friend Mr. Burchell, that ſaved our Sophia, and that run you down fairly in the argument.</q> —"Confute me in argument, child!" cried I.
<q>You miſtake there, my dear. I believe there are but few that can do that: I never diſpute your abilities at making a gooſe-pye, and I beg you'll leave argument to me,</q> —As I ſpoke, poor Mr. Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chell entered the houſe, and was welcomed by the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who ſhook him heartily by the hand, while little Dick officiouſly reached him a chair.</p>
                     <p>I was pleaſed with the poor man's friendſhip for two reaſons; becauſe I knew that he wanted mine, and I knew him to be friendly as far as he was able. He was known in our neighbourhood by the character of the poor Gentleman that would do no good when he was young, though he was not yet above thirty. He would at intervals talk with great good ſenſe; but in general he was fondeſt of the company of children, whom he uſed to call harmleſs little men. He was famous, I found, for ſinging them ballads, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of Beverland, with the hiſtory of Patient Griſſel. The adventures of Catſkin next entertained them, and then Fair Roſamond's bower. Our cock, which always crew at eleven, now told us it was time for repoſe; but an unforeſeen difficulty ſtarted about lodging the ſtranger: all our beds were already taken up, and it was too late to ſend him to the next ale-houſe. In this dilemma, little Dick offered him his part of the bed, if his brother Moſes would let him lie with him; And I, cried Bill,
<q>will give Mr. Burchell my part, if my ſiſters will take me to theirs</q> —"Well done, my good children," cried I,
<q>hoſpitality is one of the firſt chriſtian duties. The beaſt retires to its ſhelter, and the bird flies to its neſt; but helpleſs man can only find refuge from his fellow creature. The greateſt ſtranger in this world, was he that came to ſave it. He never had an houſe as if willing to ſee what hoſpitality was left re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining amongſt us. Deborah, my dear,</q> cried I, to my wife,
<q>give thoſe boys a lump of ſugar each, and let Dick's be the largeſt, becauſe he ſpoke firſt.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the morning early I called out my whole family to help at ſaving an after-growth of hay, and our gueſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering his aſſiſtance, he was accepted among the number. Our labours went on lightly, we turned the ſwath to the wind, I went foremoſt, and the reſt followed in due ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion. I could not avoid, however, obſerving the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiduity of Mr. Burchell, in aſſiſting my daughter Sophia in her part of the taſk. When he had finiſhed his own, he would join in her's, and enter into a cloſe converſation: but I had too good an opinion of Sophia's underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and was too well convinced of her ambition, to be under any uneaſineſs from a man of a broken fortune. When we were finiſhed for the day, Mr. Burchell was invited as on the night before; but he refuſed, as he was to lie that night at a neighbour's to whoſe child he was carrying a whiſtle. When gone, our converſation at ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per turned upon our late unfortunate gueſt.
<q>What a ſtrong inſtance.</q> ſaid I,
<q>is that poor man of the miſeries attending a youth of levity and extravagance. He by no means wants ſenſe, which only ſerves to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate his former folly. Poor forlorn creature, where are now the revellers, the flatterers, that he
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:012405_0026_0F8972ACF3EA8AE8"/>
could once inſpire and command! Gone, perhaps, to attend the bagnio pander, grown rich by his extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance. They once praiſed him, and now they applaud the pander: their former raptures at his wit, are now converted into ſarcaſms at his folly: he is poor, and perhaps deſerves poverty; for he has neither the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition to be independent, nor the ſkill to be uſeful.</q>
Prompted, perhaps, by ſome ſecret reaſons, I delivered this obſervation with too much acrimony, which my Sophia gently reproved.
<q>Whatſoever his former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct may be, papa, his circumſtances ſhould exempt him from cenſure now. His preſent indigence is a ſufficient puniſhment for former folly; and I have heard my papa himſelf ſay, that we ſhould never ſtrike our unneceſſary blow at a victim over whom providence already holds the ſcourge of its reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</q> —"You are right, Sophy," cried my ſon Moſes,
<q>and one of the ancients finely repreſents ſo malicious a conduct, by the attempts of a ruſtic to flay Marſyas, whoſe ſkin, the fable tells us, had been wholly ſtript off by another. Beſides, I don't know if this poor man's ſituation be ſo bad as my father would repreſent it. We are not to judge of the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of others, by what we might feel if in their place. However dark the habitation of the mole to our eyes, yet the animal itſelf, finds the apartment ſufficiently lightſome. And to confeſs a truth, this man's mind ſeems fitted to his ſtation; for I never heard any one more ſprightly than he was to-day, when he converſed with you.</q> —This was ſaid without the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, however it excited a bluſh, which ſhe ſtrove to cover by an affected laugh, aſſuring him that ſhe ſcarce took any notice of what he ſaid to her; but that ſhe believed he might once have been a very fine gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. The readineſs with which ſhe undertook to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate herſelf, and her bluſhing were ſymptoms I did not internally approve; but I repreſt my ſuſpicions.</p>
                     <p>As we expected our landlord the next day, my wife went to make the veniſon paſty; Moſes ſat reading, while I taught the little ones: my daughters ſeemed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually buſy with the reſt; and I obſerved them for a good while cooking ſomething over the fire. I at firſt
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:012405_0027_0F8972ADB3EA34F8"/>
ſuppoſed they were aſſiſting their mother; but little Dick informed me in a whiſper, that they were making a <hi>waſh</hi> for the face. Waſhes of all kinds I had a natural anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy to; for I knew, that inſtead of mending the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, they ſpoiled it. I therefore approached my chair by ſly degrees to the fire, and graſping the poker, as if it wanted mending, ſeemingly by accident, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the whole compoſition, and it was too late to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin another.</p>

                     <p>WHEN the morning arrived on which we were to entertain our young landlord, it may be eaſily ſuppoſed what proviſions were exhauſted to make an appearance. It may alſo be conjectured, that my wife and daughters expanded their gayeſt plumage upon this occaſion. Mr. Thornhill came with a couple of friends, his chaplain and feeder. The ſervants, who were nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, he politely ordered to the next ale-houſe: but my wife, in the triumph of her heart, inſiſted on enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining them all; for which, by the bye, the family was pinched for three weeks after. As Mr. Burchell had hinted to us the day before, that he was making ſome propoſals of marriage to Miſs Wilmot, my ſon George's former miſtreſs, this a good deal damped the heartineſs of his reception: but accident, in ſome meaſure relieved our embarraſſment; for one of the company happening to mention her name, Mr. Thornhill obſerved with an oath, that he never knew any thing more abſurd than calling ſuch a fright a beauty: "for ſtrike me ugly," continued he,
<q>if I ſhould not find as much pleaſure in chooſing my miſtreſs by the information of a lamp un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the clock at St. Duſtan's.</q> At this he laughed, and ſo did we:—the jeſts of the rich are ever ſucceſsful.

Olivia too, could not avoid whiſpering, loud enough to be heard, that he had an infinite fund of humour.</p>
                     <p>After dinner, I began with my uſual toaſt, the church; for this I was thanked by the chaplain, as he ſaid the church was the only miſtreſs of his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. —"Come tell us honeſtly, Frank," ſaid the 'Squire, with his uſual archneſs, "ſuppoſe the church, your preſent miſtreſs, dreſt in lawn ſleeves, on one hand, and Miſs Sophia, with no lawn about her on the other, which would you be for?" "For both, to be ſure," cried the chaplain.—"Right Frank," cried the 'Squire; "for may this glaſs ſuffocate me but a fine girl is worth all the prieſtcraft in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For what are tythes and tricks but an impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, all a confounded impoſture, and I can prove it." —"I wiſh you would," cried my ſon Moſes, "and I think," continued he, "that I ſhould be able to combat in the oppoſition."—"Very well, Sir," cried the 'Squire, who immediately ſmoaked him, and winking on the reſt of the company, to prepare us for the ſport, "if you are for a cool argument upon that ſubject, I am ready to accept the challenge. And firſt, whether are you for managing it analogically, or dialogically? "I am for managing it rationally," cried Moſes, quite happy at being permitted to diſpute. "Good again," cried the 'Squire, and firſtly, of the firſt. I hope you'll not deny that whatever is is. If you dont grant me that, I can go no further."—Why," return'd Moſes, "I think I may grant that, and make the beſt of it."—"I hope too," returned the other, "you'll grant that a part is leſs than the whole." "I grant that too," cried Moſes, "it is but juſt and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable." —"I hope, cried the 'Squire, "you will not deny, that the two angles of a triangle are equal to two right ones."—"Nothing can be plainer," return'd t'other, and looked round with his uſual importance.—"Very well," cried the 'Squire ſpeaking very quick, "the premiſes being thus ſettled, I proceed to obſerve, that the concatenation of ſelf exiſtences, proceeding in a reciprocal duplicate ratio, naturally produce a problematical dialogiſm, which in ſome meaſure proves that the eſſence of ſpirituality may
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:012405_0029_0F8972AF333D10C0"/>
be referred to the ſecond predicable."—"Hold, hold," cried the other, "I deny that: Do you think I can thus tamely ſubmit to ſuch heterodox doctrines?" —"What," replied the 'Squire, as if in a paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, "not ſubmit! Anſwer me one plain queſtion; Do you think Ariſtotle right when he ſays, that relatives are related?" undoubtedly," replied the other.— "If ſo then," cried the 'Squire, "anſwer me directly to what I propoſe; Whether do you judge the analyti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal inveſtigation of the firſt part of my enthymem defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſecundum quoad, or quoad minus, and give me your reaſons, too: give me your reaſons I ſay, directly," "I proteſt," cried Moſes, I don't rightly comprehend the force of your reaſoning; but if it be reduced to one ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple propoſition, I fancy it may have an anſwer,"—"O then ſir," cried the 'Squire, "I am your moſt humble ſervant, I find you want me to furniſh you with argument and intellects both. No, Sir, there I proteſt you are too hard for me." This effectually raiſed the laugh againſt poor Moſes, who ſate the only diſmal figure in a groupe of merry faces: nor did he offer a ſingle ſyllable more dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole entertainment.</p>
                     <p>But though all this gave me no pleaſure, it had a very different effect upon Olivia, who miſtook this humour, which was a mere act of the memory, for real wit. She thought him therefore a very fine gentleman: and ſuch as conſider what powerful ingredients a good figure, fine cloaths, and fortune, are in that character, will eaſily forgive her. Mr. Thornhill notwithſtanding his real ignorance, talked with eaſe, and could expatiate upon the common topics of converſation with fluency. It is not ſurpriſing then, that ſuch talents ſhould win the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of a girl, who by education was taught to value an appearance in herſelf, and conſequently to ſet a value upon it when found in another.</p>
                     <p>Upon his departure, we again entered into a debate upon the merits of our young landlord. As he directed his looks and converſation to Olivia, it was no longer doubted but that ſhe was the object that induced him to be our viſitor. Nor did ſhe ſeem to be much diſpleaſed at the innocent raillery of her brother and ſiſter upon this occaſion. Even Deborah herſelf ſeemed to ſhare the
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:012405_0030_0F8972AFF1E8FE28"/>
glory of the day, and exulted in her daughter's victory as if it were her own. "And now, my dear," cried ſhe to me, "I'll fairly own, that it was I that inſtructed my girls to encourage our landlord's addreſſes. I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſome ambition, and you now ſee that I was right; for who knows how this may end?" Ay, who knows that indeed? anſwered I, with a groan: "for my own part I don't much like it; and I could have been better pleaſed with one that was poor and honeſt, than this fine gentleman with his fortune and infidelity, for depend on't; if he be what I ſuſpect him, no free-thinker ſhall ever have a child of mine.</p>
                     <p>"Sure, father," cried Moſes, "you are too ſevere in this; for heaven will never arraign him for what he thinks, but for what he does. Every man has a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand vicious thoughts, which ariſe without his power to ſuppreſs. Thinking freely of religion, may be invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary with this gentleman; ſo that allowing his ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be wrong, yet as he is purely paſſive in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, he is no more to be blamed for their incurſions, than the governor of a city without walls for the ſhelter he is obliged to afford an invading enemy."</p>
                     <p>"True, my ſon," cried I; "but if the governor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites the enemy, there he is juſtly culpable. And ſuch is always the caſe with thoſe who embrace error. The vice does not lie in aſſenting to the proofs they ſee; but in being blind to many of the proofs that offer. Like corrupt judges on a bench, they determine right on that part of the evidence they hear; but they will not hear all the evidence. Thus, my ſon, though our erroneous opinions be involuntary when formed, yet as we have been wilfully corrupt, or very negligent in forming them, we deſerve puniſhment for our v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>My wife now kept up the converſation, though not the argument: ſhe obſerved, that ſeveral very prudent men of our acquaintance were free thinkers, and made very good huſbands; and ſhe knew ſome ſenſible girls, that had ſkill enough to make converts of their ſpouſes: "And who knows, my dear," continued ſhe, "what Olivia may be able <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſay upon every ſubject, and to my knowledge is very well ſkilled in controverſy."</p>
                     <p>"Why, my dear, what controverſy can ſhe have read?" cried I. "It does not occur to my memory that I ever put ſuch books into her hands: you certainly over-rate her merit," "Indeed, papa, replied Olivia, "ſhe does not: I have read a great deal of controverſy. I have read the diſputes between Thwackum and Square; the controverſy between Robinſon Cruſoe and Friday the ſavage, and I am now employed in reading the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy in the Religious courtſhip."—"Very well," cried I, "that's a good girl, I find you are perfectly qualified for making converts, and ſo go help your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to make the gooſeberry-pye."</p>

                     <head>CHAP. VIII. An amour, which promiſes little good fortune, yet may be productive of much.</head>
                     <p>THE next morning we were again viſited by Mr. Burchell, though I began, for certain rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to be diſpleaſed with the frequency of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; but I could not refuſe him my company and fire-ſide. It is true, his labour more than requited his entertainments; for he wrought among us with vigour, and either in the meadow or at the hay-rick, put himſelf foremoſt. Beſides, he had always ſomething amuſing to ſay, that leſſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ed our toil, and was at once ſo out of the way, and yet ſo ſenſible, that I loved, laughed at, and pitied him. My only diſlike aroſe from an attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he diſcovered to my daughter: he would, in a jeſting manner, call her his little miſtreſs, and when he bought each of the girls a ſet of ribbands, her'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> was the fineſt. I knew not how, but he every day ſeemed to become more amiable, his wit to improve, and his ſimplicity to aſſume the ſuperior airs of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="33" facs="unknown:012405_0032_0F8972B282CDE540"/>Our family dined in the field, and we ſate, or rather reclined, round a temperate repaſt, our cloth ſpread up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the hay, while Mr. Burchel ſeemed to give chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to the feaſt. To heighten our ſatisfaction two blackbirds anſwered each other from oppoſite hedges, the familiar red-breaſt came and pecked the crumbs from our hands, and every ſound ſeemed but the echo of tranquillity. "I never ſit thus," ſays Sophia, "but I think of the two lovers, ſo ſweetly deſcribed by Mr. Gay, who were ſtruck dead in each other's arms under a barley mow. There is ſomething ſo pathetic in the deſcription, that I have read it an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times with new rapture."—"In my opinion," cried my ſon, "the fineſt ſtrokes in that deſcription, are much below thoſe in the Acis and Galatea of Ovid. The Roman poet underſtands the uſe of <hi>contraſt</hi> better, and upon that figure artfully managed all ſtrength in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetic depends."—"It is remarkable," cried Mr. Burchell, "that both the poets you mention, have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually contributed to introduce a falſe taſte into their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective countries, by loading all their lines with epithet. Men of little genius found them moſt eaſily imitated in their defects, and Engliſh poetry, like that in the latter empire of Rome, is nothing at preſent but a combination of luxuriant images, without plot or connexion; a ſtring of epithets that improve the ſound, without carrying on the ſenſe. But, perhaps, madam, while I thus repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend others, you'll think it juſt that I ſhould give them an opportunity to retaliate, and indeed I have made this remark, only to have an opportunity of introducing to the company a ballad, which, whatever be its other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, is, I think, at leaſt free from thoſe I have menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned."</p>

But our tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity was ſoon diſturbed by the report of a gun juſt by us, and immediately after a man was ſeen burſting thro' the hedge, to take up the game he had killed. This ſportſman was the 'Squire's chaplain, who had ſhot one of the black birds that ſo agreeably entertained us. So loud a report, and ſo near, ſtartled my daughters; and I could perceive that Sophia in the fright had thrown herſelf into Mr. Burchell's arms for protection. The gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman came up, and aſked pardon for having diſturbed us, affirming that he was ignorant of our being ſo near. He therefore ſate down by my youngeſt daughter, and, ſportſman like, offered her what he had killed that morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. She was going to refuſe, but a private look from her mother ſoon induced her to correct the miſtake, and accept his preſent, though with ſome reluctance. My wife, as uſual diſcovered her pride in a whiſper, obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that Sophy had made a conqueſt of the chaplain, as well as her ſiſter had of the 'Squire. I ſuſpected how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, with more probability, that her affections were placed upon a different object. The chaplain's errand was to inform us, that Mr. Thornhill had provided mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic and refreſhments, and intended that night giving the young ladies a ball by moon-light, on the graſs-plot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our door. "Nor can I deny," continued he, but I have an intereſt in being firſt to deliver this meſſage, as I expect for my reward to be honoured with miſs Sophia's hand as a partner." To this my girl replied, that ſhe ſhould have no objection, if ſhe could do it with honour: "But here," continued ſhe, "is a gentleman," looking at Mr Burchell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> "who has been my companion in the taſk for the day, and it is fit he ſhould ſhare in its amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments." Mr. Burchell returned her a compliment for her intentions; but reſigned her up to the chaplain, adding, that he was to go that night five miles, being invited to an harveſt ſupper. His refuſal appeared to me a little extraordinary, nor could I conceive how ſo ſenſible a girl as my youngeſt, could thus prefer a middle aged man of broken fortune, to a ſprightly young fellow of twenty-two. But as men are moſt capable of diſtinguiſhing me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in women, ſo the ladies often form the trueſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

                     <p>MR. Burchell had ſcarce taken leave, and Sophia conſented to dance with the chaplain, when my little ones came running out to tell us that the 'Squire was come, with a crowd of company. Upon our return, we found our landlord, with a couple of under gentlemen and two young ladies richly dreſt, whom he introduced as women of very great diſtinction and faſhion from town. We happened not to have chairs enough for the whole company; but Mr. Thornhill immediately propoſed that every gentleman ſhould ſit in a lady's lap. This I poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively objected to, notwithſtanding a look of diſapproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from my wife. Moſes was therefore diſpatched to borrow a couple of chairs; and as we were in want of ladies alſo to make up a ſet at country dances, the two gentlemen went with him in queſt of a couple of part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Chairs and partners were ſoon provided. The gentlemen returned with my neighbour Flamborough's roſy daughters, flaunting with red top-knots. But there was an unlucky circumſtance which was not adverted to; though the Miſs Flamboroughs were reckoned the very beſt dancers in the pariſh, and underſtood the jig and the round-about to perfection; yet they were totally unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with country dances. This at firſt diſcompoſed us: however, after a little ſhoving and dragging, they beg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="40" facs="unknown:012405_0039_0F8972B772164018"/>
her heart, by aſſuring me, that though the little chit did it ſo cleverly, all the ſteps were ſtolen from herſelf. The ladies of the town ſtrove hard to be equally eaſy, but without ſucceſs. They ſwam, ſprawled, languiſhed, and friſked; but all would not do: the gazers indeed owned that it was fine; but neighbour Flamborough obſerved, that Miſs Livy's feet ſeemed as pat to the muſic as its echo. After the dance had continued about an hour, the two ladies, who were apprehenſive of catching cold, moved to break up the ball. One of them, I thought, expreſſed her ſentiments upon this occaſion in a very coarſe manner, when ſhe obſerved, that by the <hi>living jingo,</hi> ſhe was all of a muck of ſweat. Upon our return to the houſe, we found a very elegant cold ſupper, which Mr. Thornhill had ordered to be brought with him. The converſation at this time was more reſerved than before. The two ladies threw my girls quite into the ſhade; for they would talk of nothing but high life, and high lived company; with other faſhionable topics, ſuch as pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, taſte, Shakeſpear, and the muſical glaſſes. 'Tis true they once or twice mortified us ſenſibly by ſlipping out an oath; but that appeared to me as the ſureſt ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of their diſtinction, (tho' I am ſince informed ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is now perfectly unfaſhionable.) Their finery, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, threw a viel over any groſſneſs in their converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. My daughters ſeemed to regard their ſuperior ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments with envy; and what appeared amiſs was aſcribed to tip-top quality breeding. But the condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the ladies was ſtill ſuperior to their other accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments. One of them obſerved, that had miſs Olivia ſeen a little more of the world, it would greatly improve her. To which the other added, that a ſingle winter in town would make her little Sophia quite another thing. My wife warmly aſſented to both; adding, that there was nothing ſhe more ardently wiſhed, than to give her girls a ſingle winter's poliſhing. To this I could not help replying, that their breeding was already ſuperior to their fortune; and that greater refinement would only ſerve to make their poverty ridiculous, and give them a taſte for pleaſures they had no right to poſſeſs."—"And what pleaſures," cried Mr. Thornhill, "do they not deſerve, who have ſo much in their power to beſtow? As for my part," continued he, "my fortune is pretty large, love,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:012405_0040_0F8972B8330E4C18"/>
liberty, and pleaſure, are my maxims; but curſe me if a ſettlement of half my eſtate could give my charming Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via pleaſure, it ſhould be her's; and the only favour I would aſk in return, would be to add myſelf to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit." I was not ſuch a ſtranger to the world as to be ignorant that this was the faſhionable cant to diſguiſe the inſolence of the baſeſt propoſal; but I made an effort to ſuppreſs my reſentment. "Sir," cried I, "the family which you now condeſcend to favour with your compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, has been bred with as nice a ſenſe of honour as you. Any attempts to injure that, may be attended with very dangerous conſequences. Honour, Sir, is our only poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion at preſent, and of that laſt treaſure we muſt be particularly careful."—I was ſoon ſorry for the warmth with which I had ſpoken this, when the young gentleman, graſping my hand, ſwore he commended my ſpirit, though he diſapproved my ſuſpicions. "As to your preſent hint, continued he," "I proteſt nothing was farther from my heart than ſuch a thought. No, by all that's tempting, the virtue that will ſtand a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſiege was never to my taſte; for all my amours are carried by a coup de main."</p>
                     <p>The two ladies, who affected to be ignorant of the reſt, ſeemed highly diſpleaſed with this laſt ſtroke of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and began a very diſcreet and ſerious dialogue up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on virtue: in this my wife, the chaplain, and I, ſoon joined; and the 'Squire himſelf was at laſt brought to confeſs a ſenſe of ſorrow for his former exceſſes. We talked of the pleaſures of temperance, and the ſun-ſhine in the mind unpolluted with guilt. I was well pleaſed that my little ones were kept up beyond the uſual time to be edified by ſuch good converſation. Mr. Thornhill even went beyond me, and demanded if I had any objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to giving prayers. I joyfully embraced the propoſal, and in this manner the night was paſſed in a moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable way, till at laſt the company began to think of returning. The ladies ſeemed very unwilling to part from my daughters; for whom they had conceived a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular affection, and joined in a requeſt to have the pleaſure of their company home. The 'Squire ſeconded the propoſal, and my wife added her entreaties: the girls
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:012405_0041_0F8972B8F7489A68"/>
too looked upon me as if they wiſhed to go. In this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity I made two or three excuſes, which my daughters as readily removed: ſo that at laſt I was obliged to give a preremptory refuſal; for which we had nothing but ſullen looks and ſhort anſwers the whole day enſuing.</p>

                     <p>I NOW began to find that all my long and painful lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures upon temperance, ſimplicity and contentment, were entirely diſregarded. The diſtinctions lately paid us by our betters awaked that pride which I had laid aſleep, but not removed. Our windows now again, as formerly, were filled with waſhes for the neck and face. The ſun was dreaded as an enemy to the ſkin without doors, and the fire as a ſpoiler of the complexion within. My wife obſerved, that riſing too early would hurt her daughter's eyes, that working after dinner would redden their noſes, and convinced me, that the hands never looked ſo white as when they did nothing. Inſtead therefore of finiſhing George's ſhirts we now had them new modelling their old Gauzes, or flouriſhing upon cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gut. The poor Miſs Flamboroughs, their former gay companions, were caſt off as mean acquaintance, and the whole converſation ran upon high life and high lived company, with pictures, taſte, Shakeſpear, and the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical glaſſes.</p>
                     <p>But we could have borne all this, had not a fortune- telling gypſey come to raiſe us into perfect ſublimity. The tawny ſybil no ſooner appeared, than my girls came running to me for a ſhilling a-piece to croſs her hand with ſilver. To ſay the truth, I was tired of being always wiſe, and could not help gratifying their requeſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I loved to ſee them happy. I gave each of them
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:012405_0042_0F8972B9B200BC48"/>
a ſhilling; though, for the honour of the family, it muſt be obſerved, that they never went without money them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as my wife always generouſly let them have a guinea each, to keep in their pockets: but with ſtrict injunctions never to change it. After they had been clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetted up with the fortune-teller for ſome time, I knew by their looks, upon their returning, that they had been promiſed ſomething great.—"Well, my girls, how "have you ſped? Tell me, Livy, has the fortune-tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler given thee a pennyworth?"—"I proteſt, papa," ſays the girl with a ſerious face, "I believe ſhe deals with ſome body that's not right; for ſhe poſitively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that I am to be married to a great 'Squire in leſs than a twelve-month?—"Well now Sophy, my child," ſaid I, "and what ſort of a huſband are you to have?" "Sir, replied ſhe, "I am to have a Lord ſoon after my ſiſter has been married to the 'Squire."— "How," cried I, "is that all you are to have for your "two ſhillings! Only a Lord and a 'Squire for two ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings! You fools, I could have promiſed you a prince and Nabob for half the money."</p>
                     <p>This curioſity of theirs, however was attended with very ſerious effects; we now began to think ourſelves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by the ſtars for ſomething exalted, and already anticipated our future grandeur."</p>
                     <p>It has been a thouſand times obſerved, and I muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it once more, that the hours we paſs with happy proſpects in view, are more pleaſing than thoſe crowned with fruition. In the firſt caſe we cook the diſh to our own appetite; in the latter nature cooks it for us. It is impoſſible to repeat the train of agreeable reveries we call up for our entertainment. We looked upon our fortunes as once more riſing; and as the whole pariſh aſſerted that the 'Squire was in love with my daughter, ſhe was actually ſo with him; for they perſuaded her into paſſion. In this agreeable interval, my wife had the moſt luckly dreams in the world, which ſhe took care to tell us every morning, with great ſolemnity and exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. It was one night a coffin and croſs bones, the ſign of an approaching wedding, at another time ſhe imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her daughter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s pockets filled with farthings, a certain ſign of their being one day ſtuffed with gold. The girls
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:012405_0043_0F8972BA71E51DF8"/>
had their omens too: they felt ſtrange kiſſes on their lips; they ſaw rings in the candle, purſes bounced from the fire, and true love-knots lurked at the bottom of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tea-cup.</p>
                     <p>Towards the end of the week we received a card from the town ladies; in which, with their compliments, they hoped to ſee all our family at church the Sunday follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. All Saturday morning I could perceive, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this, my wife and daughters in cloſe conference together, and now and then glancing at me with looks that betrayed a latent plot. To be ſincere, I had ſtrong ſuſpicions that ſome abſurd propoſal was preparing for appearing with ſplendor the next day. In the evening they began their operations in a very regular manner, and my wife undertook to conduct the ſiege. After tea, when I ſeemed in ſpirits, ſhe began thus—"I fancy, Charles, my dear, we ſhall have a great deal of good company at our church to-morrow."—"Perhaps we may, my dear," returned I; though you need be under no uneaſineſs about that, you ſhall have a ſermon whether there be or not."—"That is what I expect," returned ſhe; "but I think, my dear, we ought to appear there as decently as poſſible, for who knows what may happen?" "Your precautions," replied I, "are highly commendable. A decent behaviour and appearance in church is what charms me. We ſhould be devout and humble, chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ſerene."—"Yes," cried ſhe, "I know that: but I mean we ſhould go there in as proper a manner as poſſible; not altogether like the ſcrubs about us." "You are quite right, my dear," returned I, "and I was going to make the very ſame propoſal. The proper manner of going is, to go there as early as poſſible, to have time for meditation before the ſervice begins."—"Phoo, Charles," interrupted ſhe, "all that is very true; but not what I would be at. I mean, we ſhould go there genteelly. You know the church is two miles off, and I proteſt I don't like to ſee my daughters trudging up to their pew all blouzed and red with walking, and looking for all the world as if they had been winners at a ſmock race. Now, my dear, my propoſal is this: there are our two plow horſes, the colt that has been in our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily theſe nine years, and his companion Blackberry, that
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:012405_0044_0F8972BBF9BDA978"/>
that have ſcarce done an earthly thing for this month paſt, and are both grown fat and lazy. Why ſhould not they do ſomething as well as we? And, let me tell you, when Moſes has trimmed them a little, they will not be ſo contemptible."</p>
                     <p>To this propoſal I objected, that walking would be twenty times more genteel than ſuch a paltry conveyance, as Blackberry was wall-eyed, and the Colt wanted a tail: that they had never been broke to the rein; but had an hundred vicious tricks; and that we had but one ſaddle and pillion in the whole houſe. All theſe objections, however were over-ruled; ſo that I was obliged to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. The next morning I perceived them not a little buſy in collecting ſuch materials as might be neceſſary for the expedition; but as I found it would be a buſineſs of much time, I walked on to the church before, and they promiſed ſpeedily to follow. I waited near and hour in the reading deſk for their arrival; but not finding them come as expected, I was obliged to begin, and went through the ſervice, not without ſome uneaſineſs at find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them abſent. This was encreaſed when all was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, and no appearance of the family. I therefore walked back by the horſeway, which was five miles round, though the foot-way was but two, and when got about half way home, perceived the proceſſion marching ſlowly forward towards the church; my ſon, my wife, and the two little ones exalted upon one horſe, and my two daughters upon the other. I demanded the cauſe of their delay; but I ſoon found by their looks they had met with a thouſand misfortunes on the road. The horſes had at firſt refuſed to move from the door, till Mr. Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chell was kind enough to beat them forward for about two hundred yards with his cudgel. Next the ſtraps of my wife's pillion broke down, and they were obliged to ſtop to repair them before they could proceed. After that, one of the horſes took it into his head to ſtand ſtill, and neither blows nor entreaties could prevail with him to proceed. It was juſt recovering from this diſmal ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation that I found them; but perceiving every thing ſafe, I own their preſent mortification did not much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe me, as it might give me many opportunities of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture triumph and teach my daughters more humility.</p>

                     <p>ALLHALOWS eve happening on the next day, we were invited to burn nuts and play tricks at neighbour Flamborough's. Our late mortifications had humbled us a little, or it is probable we might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected ſuch an invitation with contempt: however, we ſuffered ourſelves to be happy. Our honeſt neighbour's gooſe and dumplings were fine, and the lamb's-wool, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the opinion of my wife, who was a connoiſſeur, was thought excellent. It is true, his manner of telling ſtories was not quite ſo well. They were very long, and very dull, and all about himſelf, and we had laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at them ten times before: however, we were kind enough to laugh at them once more.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Burchell, who was of the party, was always fond of ſeeing ſome innocent amuſement going forward, and ſet the boys and girls to blind man's buff. My wife too was perſuaded to join in the diverſion, and it gave me pleaſure to think ſhe was not yet too old. In the mean time, my neighbour and I looked on, laughed at every feat, and praiſed our own dexterity when we were young. Hot cockles ſucceeded next, queſtions and commands followed that, and laſt of all, they ſate down to hunt the ſlipper. As every perſon may not be accquainted with this primaeval paſtime, it may be neceſſary to obſerve, that the company at this play plant themſelves in a ring upon the ground, all, except one who ſtands in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, whoſe buſineſs it is to catch a ſhoe, which the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſhove about under their hams from one to another, ſomething like a weaver's ſhuttle. As it is impoſſible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in this caſe for the lady who is up to face all the company at once, the great beauty of the play lies in hitting her a thump with the heel of the ſhoe on that ſide leaſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of making a defence. It was in this manner that
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:012405_0046_0F8972BD73EEA998"/>
my eldeſt daughter was hemmed in, and thumped about, all blowzed, in ſpirits, and bawling for fair play, fair play, with a voice that might deafen a ballad ſinger, when, confuſion on confuſion, who ſhould enter the room but our two great acquaintances from town, Lady Blarny and Miſs Carolina Wilelmina Amelia Skeggs! Deſcription would but beggar, therefore it is unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to deſcribe this new mortification. Death! To be ſeen by ladies of ſuch high breeding in ſuch vulgar atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes! Nothing better could enſue from ſuch a vulgar play of Mr. Flamborough's propoſing. We ſeemed ſtruck to the ground for ſome time, as if actually petrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with amazement.</p>
                     <p>The two ladies had been at our houſe to ſee us, and finding us from home, came after us hither, as they were uneaſy to know what accident could have kept us from church the day before. Olivia under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to be our prolocutor, and delivered the whole in a ſummary way, only ſaying, "We were thrown from our horſes." At which account the ladies were greatly concerned: but being told the family received no hurt, they were extremely glad: but being informed that we were almoſt killed by the fright, they were vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſorrow; but hearing that we had a very good night, they were extremely glad again. Nothing could exceeed their complaiſance to my daughters; their profeſſions the laſt evening were warm, but now they were ardent. They proteſted a deſire of having a more laſting acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Lady Blarny was particularly attached to Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via; Miſs Carolina Wilelmina Amelia Skeggs (I love to give the whole name) took a greater fancy to her ſiſter. They ſupported the converſation between themſelves while my daughters ſate ſilent, admiring their exalted breeding. But as every reader, however beggarly him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is fond of high lived dialogues, with anecdotes of Lords, Ladies, and Knights of the Garter, I muſt beg leave to give him the concluding part of the preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</p>
                     <p>"All that I know of the matter," cried Miſs Skeggs, "is this, that it may be true, or it may not be true: but this I can aſſure your Ladyſhip, that the whole rout was in amaze; his Lordſhip turned all manner of colours,
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:012405_0047_0F8972BE329C2188"/>
my lady fell into a ſwoon; but Sir Tomkyn, drawing his ſword, ſwore he was her's to the laſt drop of his blood."</p>
                     <p>"Well replied our Peereſs, "this I can ſay, that the Dutcheſs never told me a ſyllable of the matter, and I believe her Grace would keep nothing a ſecret from me. But this you may depend upon as fact, that the next morning my Lord Duke cried out three times to his valet de chambre, Jernigan, Jernigan Jernigan, bring me my garters."</p>
                     <p>But previouſly I ſhould have mentioned the very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polite behaviour of Mr. Burchell, who, during this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, ſate with his face turned to the fire, and at the concluſion of every ſentence would cry out <hi>fudge,</hi> an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion which diſpleaſed us all, and in ſome meaſure damped the riſing ſpirit of the converſation.</p>
                     <p>"Beſides, my dear Skeggs," continued our Peereſs, "there is nothing of this in the copy of verſes that Dr. Burdock made upon the occaſion."</p>
                     <p>"I am ſurprized at that," cried Miſs Skeggs; "for he ſeldom leaves any thing out, as he writes only for his own amuſement. But can your Ladyſhip favour me with a ſight of them?"</p>
                     <p>"My dear creature," replied our Peereſs, "do you think I carry ſuch things about me? Though they are very fine to be ſure, and I think myſelf ſomething of a judge; at leaſt I know what pleaſes myſelf. Indeed I was ever an admirer of all doctor Burdock's little pieces; for except what he does, and our dear Counteſs at Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nover-Square, there's nothing comes out but the moſt loweſt ſtuff in nature; not a bit of high life among them."</p>
                     <p>"Your Ladyſhip ſhould except," ſays t'other, 'your own things in the Lady's Magazine. I hope you'll ſay there's nothing low lived there; but I ſuppoſe we are to have no more from that quarter."</p>
                     <p>"Why, my dear," ſays the lady, "you know my reader and companion has left me, to be married to cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Roach, and as my poor eyes won't ſuffer me to write myſelf, I have been for ſome time looking out for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. A proper perſon is no eaſy matter to find, and to be ſure thirty pounds a year is a ſmall ſtipend for a well bred girl of character, that can read, write, and behave
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:012405_0048_0F8972BEF39D4990"/>
in company; as for the chits about town, there is no bearing them about one.</p>
                     <p>"That I know," cried Miſs Skeggs, by experience. For of the three companions I had this laſt half year, one of them refuſed to do plain work an hour in the day, another thought twenty-five guineas a year too ſmall a ſalary, and I was obliged to ſend away the third, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I ſuſpected an intrigue with the chaplain. Virtue, my dear Lady Blarny, virtue is worth any price; but where is that to be found?"</p>
                     <p>My wife had been for a long time all attention to this diſcourſe; but was particularly ſtruck with the latter part of it. Thirty pounds and twenty-five guineas a year, made fifty-ſix pounds five ſhillings Engliſh money, all which was in a manner going a-begging, and might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be ſecured in the family. She for a moment ſtudied my looks for approbation; and, to own a truth, I was of opinion, that two ſuch places would fit our two daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters exactly. Beſides, if the 'Squire had any real affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for my eldeſt daughter, this would be the way to make her every way qualified for her fortune. My wife therefore was reſolved that we ſhould not be deprived of ſuch advantages for want of aſſurance, and undertook to harrangue for the family. "I hope," cried ſhe, your Ladyſhips will pardon my preſent preſumption. It is true, we have no right to pretend to ſuch favours; but yet is natural for me to wiſh putting my children for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the world. And I will be bold to ſay, my two girls have had a pretty good education, and capacity, at leaſt the country can't ſhew better. They can read, write, and caſt accompts; they underſtand their needle, breadſtich, croſs and change, and all manner of plain work; they can pink, point, and frill; and know ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of muſic; they can make up ſmall cloaths, work upon catgut; my eldeſt can cut paper, and my younge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     <p>When ſhe had delivered this pretty piece of eloquence, the two ladies looked at each other a few minutes in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, with an air of doubt and importance. At l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

very fit for ſuch employments: "But a thing of this kind, Madam," cried ſhe, addreſſing my ſpouſe, "re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a thorough examination into characters, and a more perfect knowledge of each other. Not Madam," continued ſhe, "that I in the leaſt ſuſpect the young ladies virtue, prudence and diſcretion; but there is a form in theſe things, Madam, there is a form."</p>
                     <p>My wife approved her ſuſpicions very much, obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that ſhe was very apt to be ſuſpicious herſelf; but referred her to all the neighbours for a character: but this our Peereſs declined as unneceſſary, alledging that her couſin Thornhill's recommendation would be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and upon this we reſted our petition.</p>

Carolina Wilelmina Amelia Skeggs has my warm heart. But yet, when they came to talk of places in town, you ſaw how at once<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I nailed them. Tell me, my dear, don't you think I did for my children there?—" Ay," returned I, not knowing well what to think of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, heaven grant they may both be the better for it this day three months!" This was one of thoſe obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I uſually made to impreſs my wife with an opinion of my ſagacity; for if the girls ſucceeded, then it was a pious wiſh fulfilled: but if any thing unfortunate en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, then it might be looked upon as a prophecy. All this converſation, however, was only preparatory to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſcheme, and indeed I dreaded as much. This was nothing leſs than, that as we were now to hold up our heads a little higher in the world, it would be proper to ſell the Colt, which was grown old, at a neighbouring fair, and buy us an horſe that would carry ſingle or dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble upon an occaſion, and make a pretty appearance at church or upon a viſit. This at firſt I oppoſed ſtoutly; but it was as ſtoutly defended. However, as I weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, my antagoniſt gained ſtrength, till at laſt it was reſolved to part with him.</p>
                     <p>As the fair happened on the following day, I had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of going myſelf; but my wife perſuaded me that I had got a cold, and nothing could prevail upon her to permit me from home. "No, my dear," ſaid ſhe, "our ſon Moſes is a diſcreet boy, and can buy and ſell to very good advantage; you know all our great bargains are of his purchaſing. He always ſtands out and higgles, and actually tires them till he gets a bargain."</p>
                     <p>As I had ſome opinion of my ſon's prudence, I was willing enough to entruſt him with this commiſſion, and the next morning I perceived his ſiſters mighty buſy in fitting out Moſes for the fair; trimming his hair, bruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his buckles, and cocking his hat with pins. The buſineſs of the toilet being over, we had at laſt the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of ſeeing him mounted upon the Colt, with a doal box before him to bring home groceries in. He had on a coat made of that cloth they call thunder and lightening, which though grown too ſhort, was much too good to be thrown away. His waiſtcoat was of goſling <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n, and his ſiſters had tied his hair with a broad black
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:012405_0051_0F8972C137CADE10"/>
riband. We all followed him ſeveral paces from the door, bawling after him good luck, good luck, till we could ſee no him longer.</p>
                     <p>He was ſcarce gone, when Mr. Thornhill's butler came to congratulate us upon our good fortune, ſaying that he overheard his young maſter mention our names with great commendations.</p>
                     <p>Good fortune ſeemed reſolved not to come alone. Another footman from the ſame family followed with a card for my daughters, importing, that the two ladies had received ſuch a pleaſing account from Mr. Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill of us all, that after a few previous enquires more they hoped to be perfectly ſatisfied. "Ay," cried my wife, "I now ſee it is no eaſy matter to get into the families of the great; but when one once gets in, then as Moſes ſays, they may go ſleep." To this piece of humour, for ſhe intended it for wit, my daughters aſſented with a loud laugh of pleaſure. In ſhort, ſuch was her ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at this meſſage, that ſhe actually put her hand to her pocket, and gave the meſſenger ſeven pence halfpenny.</p>
                     <p>This was to be our viſiting-day. The next that came was Mr. Burchell, who had been at the fair. He brought my little ones a pennyworth of gingerbread each, which my wife undertook to keep for them, and gave them by letters at a time.. He brought my daughters alſo a couple of boxes, in which they might keep wafers, ſnuff, patch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es or even mony, when they got it. My wife was uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally fond of a weeſel ſkin purſe, as being the moſt lucky; but this by the bye. We had ſtill a regard for Mr. Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chell, though his late rude behaviour was in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure diſpleaſing: nor could we now avoid communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our happineſs to him, and aſking his advice: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we ſeldom followed advice, we were all ready e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to aſk it. When he read the note from the two ladies, he ſhook his head, and obſerved, that an affair of this ſort demanded the utmoſt circumſpection.—This air of diffidence highly diſpleaſed my wife. "I never doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Sir," cried ſhe, "your readineſs to be againſt my daughters and me. You have more circumſpection than is wanted. However, I fancy when we come to aſk ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, we will apply to perſons who ſeem to have made uſe of it themſelves."—"Whatever my own cond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

may have been, madam," replied he, "is not the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent queſtion; though as I have made no uſe of advice myſelf, I ſhould in conſcience give it to thoſe that will." —As I was apprehenſive this anſwer might draw on a repartee, making up by abuſe what it wanted in wit, I changed the ſubject, by ſeeming to wonder what could keep our ſon ſo long at the fair, as it was now almoſt night-fall.—Never mind our ſon," cried my wife, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon it he knows what he is about. I'll warrant we'll never ſee him ſell his hen of a rainy day. I have ſeen him buy ſuch bargains as would amaze one. I'll tell you a good ſtory about that, that will make you ſplit your ſides with laughing.—But as I live, yonder comes Moſes, without an horſe, and the box at his back."</p>
                     <p>As ſhe ſpoke, Moſes came ſlowly on foot, and ſweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the deal box, which he had ſtrapt round his ſhoulders.—"Welcome, welcome Moſes; well, my boy, what have you brought us from the fair?"—"I have brought you myſelf," cried Moſes with a ſly look, and reſting the box on the dreſſer.—"Ay Moſes cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my wife, that we know, but where is the horſe?" "I have ſold him," cried Moſes, "for three pounds five ſhillings and two-pence."—Well done, my good boy," returned ſhe, "I knew you would touch them off. Between ourſelves, three pounds five ſhillings and two-pence is no bad days work. Come, let us have it then."—"I have brought back no money," cried Moſes, again. I have laid it all out in a bargain, and here it is," pulling a bundle from his breaſt: "here they are; a groce of green ſpectacles, with ſilver rims and ſhagreen caſes."—"A groce of green ſpectacles!" re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated my wife in a faint voice. And you have part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Colt, and brought us back nothing but a groce of green paltry ſpectacles!"—"Dear, mother," cried the boy, why won't you liſten to reaſon? I had them a dead bargain, or I ſhould not have bought them. The ſilver rims alone will ſell for double the money."— "A fig for the ſilver rims, cried my wife<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in a paſſion: "I dare ſwear they won't ſell for above half the money at the rate of broken ſilver, five ſhillings an ounce."— "You need be under no uneaſineſs," cried I, "about <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>lling the rims; for I perceive they are only copper

varniſhed over."—What," cried my wife, "not ſilver, the rims not ſilver!" "No," cried I, "no more ſilver than your ſauce-pan."—"And ſo," returned ſhe, we have parted with the Colt, and have only got a groce of green ſpectacles, with copper rims and ſhagreen caſes! A murrain take ſuch trumpery. The blockhead has been impoſed upon, and ſhould have known his company better."—"There, my dear," cried I, "you are wrong, he ſhould not have known them at all."—"Marry, hang the ideot," returned ſhe again, "to bring me ſuch ſtuff, if I had them, I would throw them into the fire." "There again you are wrong, my dear," cried I "for though they be copper we will keep them by us, as cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſpectacles, you know, are better than nothing."</p>
                     <p>By this time the unfortunate Moſes was undeceived. He now ſaw that he had indeed been impoſed upon by a prowling ſharper, who obſerving his figure, had mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him for an eaſy prey. I therefore aſked the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of his deception. He ſold the horſe, it ſeems and walked the fair in ſearch of another. A reverend looking man brought him to a tent, under a pretence of having one to ſell. "Here," continued Moſes, we met
<q>another man, very well dreſt, who deſired to borrow twenty pounds upon theſe, ſaying, that he wanted money and would diſpoſe of them for a third of the value. The firſt gentleman, who pretended to be my friend, whiſpered me to buy them and cautioned me not to let ſo good an offer paſs. I ſent for Mr. Flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough, and they talked him up as finely as they did me, and ſo at laſt we were perſuaded to buy the two groce between us.</q>

                     <head>CHAP. XIII. Mr. Burchell is found to be an enemy; for he has the confidence to give diſagreeable advice.</head>
                     <p>OUR family had now made ſeveral attempts to be fine; but ſome unforeſeen diſaſter demoliſhed each as ſoon as projected. I endeavoured to take the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of every diſappointment, to improve their good ſenſe in proportion as they were fruſtrated in ambition. "You ſee, my children," cried I, "how little is to be got by attempts to impoſe upon the world, in coping with our betters. Such as are poor and will aſſociate with none but the rich, are hated by thoſe they avoid, and deſpiſed by thoſe they follow. Unequal combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are always diſadvantageous to the weaker ſide: the rich having the pleaſure, and the poor the inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that reſult from them. But come, Dick, my boy, and repeat the fable that you were reading to-day, for the good of the company."</p>
                     <p>"Once upon a time," cried the child, "a Giant and a Dwarf were friends, and kept together. They made a bargain that they would never forſake each other, but go ſeek adventures. The firſt battle they fought was with two Saracens, and the Dwarf, who was very cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous, dealt one of the champions a moſt angry blow. It did the Saracen but very little injury, who lifting up his ſword fairly ſtruck off the poor Dwarf's arm. He was now in a woeful plight; but the Giant coming to his aſſiſtance, in a ſhort time left the two Saracens dead on the plain, and the Dwarf cut off the dead man's head out of ſpite. They then travelled on to another adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. This was againſt three bloody minded Satyrs, who were carrying away a damſel in diſtreſs. The Dwarf was not quite ſo fierce now as before; but for all that, ſtruck the firſt blow, which was returned by another,
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:012405_0055_0F8972C543920830"/>
that knocked out his eye: but the Giant was ſoon up with them, and had they not fled, would certainly have killed them every one. They were all very joyful for this victory, and the damſel who was relieved fell in love with the Giant, and married him. They now travelled far, and farther than I can tell, till they met with a company of robbers. The Giant, for the firſt time, was foremoſt now: but the Dwarf was not far behind. The battle was ſtout and long. Wherever the Giant came, all fell before him; but the Dwarf had like to have been killed more than once. At laſt the victory declared for the two adventurers; but the Dwarf loſt his leg. The Dwarf was now without an arm, a leg, and an eye, while the Giant, who was without a ſingle wound, cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out to him, Come on my little heroe; this is glorious ſport; let us get one victory more, and then we ſhall have honour for ever. No, cries the Dwarf, who was by this time grown wiſer, no, I declare off, I'll fight no more: for I find in every battle, that you get all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and rewards, but all the blows fall upon me."</p>
                     <p>I was going to moralize this fable, when our attention was called off to a warm diſpute between my wife and Mr. Burchell, upon my daughter's intended expedition to town. My wife very ſtrenuouſly inſiſted upon the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages that would reſult from it. Mr. Burchell, on the contrary, diſſuaded her with great ardor, and I ſtood neuter. His preſent diſſuaſions ſeemed but the ſecond part of thoſe which were received with ſo ill a grace in the morning. The diſpute grew high, while poor De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borah, inſtead of reaſoning ſtronger, talked louder, and at laſt was obliged to take ſhelter from a defeat in cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. The concluſion of her harangue, however, was highly diſpleaſing to us all: ſhe knew ſhe ſaid, of ſome who had their own ſecret reaſons for what they adviſed; but, for her part, ſhe wiſhed ſuch to ſtay away from her houſe for the future.—"Madam," cried Burchell, with looks of great compoſure, which tended to enflame her the more, "as for ſecret reaſons, you are right: I have ſecret reaſons, which I forbear to mention, becauſe you are not able to anſwer thoſe of which I make no ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret: but I find my viſits here are become troubleſome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I'll take my leave therefore now, and perhaps come once

more to take a final farewell, when I am quitting the country." Thus ſaying, he took up his hat, nor could the attempts of Sophia, whoſe looks ſeemed to upbraid his precipitancy, prevent his going.</p>
                     <p>When gone, we all regarded each other for ſome mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes with confuſion. My wife, who knew herſelf to be the cauſe, ſtrove to hide her concern with a forced ſmile, and an air of aſſurance, which I was willing to reprove: "How, woman," cried I to her, "is it thus we treat ſtrangers? Is it thus we return their kindneſs? Be aſſured, my dear, that theſe were the harſheſt words, and to me the moſt unpleaſing that ever eſcaped your lips!—"Why would he provoke me then," replied ſhe, "but I know the motives of his advice perfectly well. He would prevent my girls from going to town, that he may have the pleaſure of my youngeſt daughter's company here at home. But whatever happens, ſhe ſhall chuſe better company than ſuch low-liv'd fellows as he."—"Low-liv'd, my dear, do you call him," cried I, "it is very poſſible we may miſtake this man's cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter: for he ſeems upon ſome occaſions the moſt finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed gentleman I ever knew.—Tell me, Sophia, my girl, has he ever given you any ſecret inſtances of his attachment?"—"His converſation with me, Sir," replied my daughter, "has ever been ſenſible, modeſt, and pleaſing. As to aught elſe, no, never. Once, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, I remember to have heard him ſay, he never knew a woman who could find merit in a man that ſeemed poor." "Such, my dear," cried I, "is the common cant of all the unfortunate or idle. But I hope you have been taught to judge properly of ſuch men, and that it would be even madneſs to expect happineſs from one who has been ſo very bad an oeconomiſt of his own. Your mother and I have now better proſpects for you. The next winter, which you will probably ſpend in town, will give you opportunities of making a more prudent choice."</p>
                     <p>What Sophia's reflections were upon this occaſion, I can't pretend to determine; but I was not diſpleaſed at the bottom, that we were rid of a gueſt from whom I had much to fear. Our breach of hoſpitality went
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:012405_0057_0F8972C6723B8EE0"/>
to my conſcience a little: but I quickly ſilenced that monitor, by two or three ſpecious reaſons, which ſerved to ſatisfy and reconcile me to myſelf. The pain which conſcience gives the man who has already done wrong, is ſoon got over. Conſcience is a coward, and thoſe faults it has not ſtrength enough to prevent, it ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom has juſtice enough to puniſh by accuſing.</p>

                     <p>THE journey of my daughters to town was now reſolved upon, Mr. Thornhill having kindly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to inſpect their conduct himſelf, and inform us by letter of their behaviour. But it was thought indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſably neceſſary that their appearance ſhould equal the greatneſs of their expectations, which could not be done without ſome expence. We debated therefore in full council, what were the eaſieſt methods of raiſing money, or, more properly ſpeaking, what we could moſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently ſell. The deliberation was ſoon finiſhed, it was found that our remaining horſe was utterly uſeleſs for the plow, without his companion, and equally unfit for the road, as wanting an eye. It was therefore deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined that we ſhould diſpoſe of him for the purpoſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-mentioned, at the neighbouring fair, and to prevent impoſition, that I ſhould go with him myſelf. Though this was one of the firſt mercantile tranſactions of my life, yet I had no doubt about acquitting myſelf with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. The opinion a man forms of his own prudence is meaſured by that of the company he keeps, and as mine was moſtly in the family way, I had conceived no unfavourable ſentiments of my worldly wiſdom. My wife, however, next morning, at parting, after I had
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:012405_0058_0F8972C7342993A0"/>
got ſome paces from the door, called me back, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe me, in a whiſper, to have all my eyes about me.</p>
                     <p>I had, in the uſual forms, when I came to the fair, put my horſe through all his his paces; but for ſome time had no bidders. At laſt a chapman ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, and after he had for a good while exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the horſe round, finding him blind of one eye, would have nothing to ſay to him: a ſecond came up; but obſerving he had a ſpavin, declared he would not take him for the driving home: a third perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he had a windgall, and would bid no money: a fourth knew by his eye, that he had the botts: a fifth, more impertinent than all the reſt, wondered what a plague I could do to the fair with a blind, ſpavined, galled hack, that was only fit to be cut up for a dog kennel. By this time, I began to have a moſt hearty contempt for the poor animal myſelf, and was almoſt aſhamed at the approach of every new cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomer; for though I did not entirely believe all the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows told me; yet I reflected that the number of witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes was a ſtrong preſumption they were right, and St. Gregory, upon good works, profeſſes himſelf to be of the ſame opinion.</p>
                     <p>I was in this mortifying ſituation, when a brother clergyman, an old acquaintance, who had alſo buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the fair, came up, and ſhaking me by the hand, propoſed adjourning to a public-houſe, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a glaſs of whatever we could get. I readily cloſed with the offer, and entering an ale-houſe, we were ſhewn into a little back room, where there was only a venerable old man, who ſat wholly intent o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a large book, which he was reading. I never in my life ſaw a figure that prepoſſeſſed me more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably. His locks of ſilver grey venerably ſhaded his temples, and his green old age ſeemed to be the reſult of health and benevolence. However, his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence did not interrupt our converſation; my friend and I diſcourſed on the various turns of fortune we had met: the Whiſtonian controverſy, my laſt pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, the archdeacon's reply, and the hard meaſure that was dealt me. But our attention was in a ſhort
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:012405_0059_0F8972C7F2F83BA8"/>
time taken off by the appearance of a youth, who, entering the room, reſpectfully ſaid ſomething ſoftly to the old ſtranger. "Make no apologies, my child," ſaid the old man, "to do good is a duty we owe to all our fellow creatures: take this, I wiſh it were more: but five pounds will relieve your diſtreſs, and you are welcome." The modeſt youth ſhed tears of gratitude, and yet his gratitude was ſcarce equal to mine. I could have hugged the good old man in my arms, his benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence pleaſed me ſo. He continued to read, and we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed our converſation, until my companion, after ſome time, recollecting that he had buſineſs to tranſact in the fair, promiſed to be ſoon back; adding, that he always deſired to have as much of Dr. Primroſe's company as poſſible. The old gentleman hearing my name mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſeemed to look at me with attention, and when my friend was gone, moſt reſpectfully demanded if I was any way related to the great Primroſe, that couragious monogamiſt, who had been the bulwark of the church. Never did my heart feel ſincerer rapture than at that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. "Sir," cried I, "the applauſe of ſo good a man, as I am ſure you are, adds to that happineſs in my breaſt which your benevolence has already excited. You behold before you, Sir, that Doctor Primroſe, the monogamiſt, whom you have been pleaſed to call great. You here ſee that unfortunate Divine, who has ſo long, and it would ill become me to ſay, ſucceſsfully, fought againſt the deuterogamy of the age." "Sir," cried the ſtranger, ſtruck with awe, "I fear I have been too fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar; but you'll forgive my curioſity, Sir: I beg par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don." "Sir," cried I, graſping his hand, "you are ſo far from diſpleaſing me by your familiarity, that I muſt beg you'll accept my friendſhip, as you already have all my eſteem."—"Then with gratitude I accept the offer," cried he, ſqueezing me by the hand, "thou glorious pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of unſhaken orthodoxy; and do I behold—I here interrupted what he was going to ſay; for tho', as an author, I could digeſt no ſmall ſhare of flattery, yet now my modeſty would permit no more. However, no lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in romance ever cemented a more inſtantaneous friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. We talked upon ſeveral ſubjects: at firſt I thought he ſeemed rather devout than learned, and began to think
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:012405_0060_0F8972C8B3958D18"/>
he deſpiſed all human doctrines as droſs. Yet this no way leſſened him in my eſteem; for I had for ſome time begun privately to harbour ſuch an opinion myſelf. I therefore took occaſion to obſerve that the world in general began to be blameably indifferent as to doctrinal matters, and followed human ſpeculations too much.— "Ay, Sir," replied he, as if he had reſerved all his learning to that moment, "Ay, Sir, the world is in its dotage, and yet the coſmogany or creation of the world has puzzled philoſophers of all ages. What a medly of opinions have they not broached upon the creation of the world? Sanconiathon, Manetho, Beroſus, and Ocellus Lucanus, have all attempted it in vain. The latter has theſe words, <hi>Anarchon ara kai atelutaion to pan,</hi> which imply that all things have neither beginning nor end. Manetho alſo, who lived about the time of Nebuchadon-Aſſer, Aſſer being a Syriac word, uſually applied as a ſurname to the kings of that country, as Teglat Phael-Aſſer, Nabon-Aſſer, he, I ſay, formed a conjecture e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually abſurd; for as we uſually ſay, <hi>ek to bib lion ku<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernetes,</hi> which implies, that books will never teach the world; ſo he attempted to inveſtigate—But, Sir, I aſk pardon, I am ſtraying from the queſtion."—That he actually was; nor could I for my life ſee how the creation of the world had any thing to do with the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs I was talking of, but it was ſufficient to ſhew me, that he was a man of letters, and I now reverenced him the more. I was reſolved therefore to bring him to the touch-ſtone; but he was too mild and too gentle to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for victory. Whenever I made any obſervation that looked like a challenge to controverſy, he would ſmile, ſhake his head, and ſay nothing; by which I underſtood he could ſay much, if he thought proper. The ſubject therefore inſenſibly changed from the buſineſs of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity to that which brought us both to the fair; mine, I told him, was to ſell an horſe, and very luckily, indeed, his was to buy one for one of his tenants. My horſe was ſoon produced, and in fine we ſtruck a bargain. Nothing now remained but to pay me, and he according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pulled out a thirty pound note, and bid me change it. Not being in a capacity of complying with his demand, he ordered the landlady to call up his footman, who
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:012405_0061_0F8972C9724BCF08"/>
made his appearance in a very genteel livery. "Here, Abraham," cried he, "go and get gold for this; you'll do it at neighbour Jackſon's, or any where." While the fellow was gone, he entertained we with a pathetic harrangue on the great ſcarcity of ſilver, which I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to improve, by deploring alſo the great ſcarcity of gold; and by the time Abraham returned, we had both agreed that money was never ſo hard to be come at as now. Abraham returned to inform us, that he had been over the whole fair and could not get change, though he had offered half a crown for doing it. This was a very great diſappointment to us all; but the old gentleman having pauſed a little, aſked me if I knew one Solomon Flamborough in my part of the country: upon replying that he was my next door neighbour, "If that be the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>aſe then," returned he, "I believe we ſhall deal. You ſhall have a draught upon him, payable at ſight; and let me tell you, he is as warm a man as any within five miles round him. Honeſt Solomon and I have been acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for many years together. I remember, I always beat him at three jumps; but he could hop upon one leg farther than I." A draught upon my neighbour was to me the ſame as money; for I was ſufficiently convinced of his ability: the draught was ſigned and put into my hands, and Mr. Jenkinſon, the old gentleman, his man Abraham, and my horſe, old Blackberry, trotted off very well pleaſed with each other.</p>
                     <p>Being now left to reflection, I began to recollect that I had done wrong in taking a draught from a ſtranger, and ſo prudently reſolved upon having back my horſe, and following the purchaſer. But this was now too late: I therefore made directly homewards, reſolving to get the draught changed into money at my friend's as faſt as poſſible. I found my honeſt neighbour ſmoaking his pipe at his own door, and informing him that I had a ſmall bill upon him, he read it twice over. "You can read the name, I ſuppoſe," cried I, "Ephraim Jenkinſon." Yes, returned he, "the name is written plain enough, and I know the gentleman too, the greateſt raſcal under the canopy of heaven. This is the very ſame rogue who ſold us the ſpectacles. Was he not a venerable look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:012405_0062_0F8972CA37AD43F0"/>
man, with grey hair, and no flaps to his pocket-holes? And did he not talk a long ſtring of learning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Greek and coſmogony and the world?" To this I replied with a groan. "Aye," continued he, "he has but that one piece of learning in the world, and he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways talks it away whenever he finds a ſcholar in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: but I know the rogue, and will catch him yet."</p>
                     <p>Though I was already ſufficiently mortified, my great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſtruggle was to come, in facing my wife and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. No truant was ever more afraid of returning to ſchool, there to behold the maſter's ſweet viſage, than I was of going home. I was determined, however, to anticipate their fury, by firſt falling into a paſſion my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                     <p>But, alas! upon entering, I found the family no way diſpoſed for battle. My wife and girls were all in tears, Mr. Thornhill having been there that day to inform them, that their journey to town was entirely over: The two ladies having heard reports of us from ſome malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon about us, were that day ſet out for London. He could neither diſcover the tendency, nor the author of theſe: but whatever they might be, or whoever might have broached them, he continued to aſſure our family of his friendſhip and protection. I found, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that they bore my diſappointment with great reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as it was eclipſed in the greatneſs of their own. But what perplexed us moſt was to think, who could be ſo baſe as to aſperſe the character of a family ſo harmleſs as ours, too humble to excite envy, and too inoffenſive to create diſguſt.</p>

                     <p>THAT evening and a part of the following day was employed in fruitleſs attempts to diſcover our enemies: ſcarce a family in the neighbourhood but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred our ſuſpicions, and each of us had reaſons for our

opinion beſt known to ourſelves. As we were in this perplexity, one of our little boys, who had been playing abroad, brought in a letter-caſe, which he found on the green. It was quickly known to belong to Mr. Burchell, with whom it had been ſeen, and, upon examination, contained ſome hints upon different ſubjects; but what particularly engaged our attention, was a ſealed note, ſuperſcribed, <hi>The Copy of a Letter to be ſent to the two Ladies at Thornhill-Caſtle.</hi> It inſtantly occured, that he was the baſe informer, and we deliberated whether the note ſhould not be broke open. I was againſt it; but Sophia, who ſaid ſhe was ſure, that of all men, he would be the laſt to be guilty of ſo much baſeneſs, inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon its being read. In this ſhe was ſeconded by the reſt of the family, and, at their joint ſolicitation, I read as follows:</p>

I am informed for a truth, that you have ſome intentions of bringing two young ladies to town, whom I have ſome knowledge of, under the character of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions. As I would neither have ſimplicity impoſed upon, nor virtue contaminated. I muſt offer it as my opinion, that the impropriety of ſuch a ſtep will be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with dangerous conſequences. It has never been my way to treat the infamous or the lewd with ſeverity; nor ſhould I now have taken this method of explaining myſelf or reproving folly, did it not aim at guilt. Take therefore the admonition of a friend, and ſeriouſly reflect on the conſequences of introducing infamy and vice into retreats where peace and innocence have hitherto reſided.</p>

                     <p>Our doubts were now at an end. There ſeemed indeed ſomething applicable to both ſides in this letter, and its cenſures might as well be referred to thoſe to whom it was written, as to us; but the malicious meaning was obvious, and we went no farther. My wife had ſcarce patience to hear me to the end, but railed at the writer with unreſtrained reſentment, Olivia was equally ſevere,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:012405_0064_0F8972CCB475FA38"/>
and Sophia ſeemed perfectly amazed at his baſeneſs. As for my part, it appeared to me one of the vileſt inſtances of unprovoked ingratitude I had met with. Nor could I account for it in any other manner, than by imputing it to his deſire of detaining my youngeſt daughter in the country, to have the more frequent opportunities of an interview. In this manner we all ſate ruminating upon ſchemes of vengeance, when our other little boy came running in to tell us that Mr. Burchell was approaching at the other end of the field. It is eaſier to conceive than deſcribe the complicated ſenſations which are felt from the pain of a recent injury, and the pleaſure of approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing revenge. Though our intentions were only to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid him with his ingratitude; yet it was reſolved to do it in a manner that would be perfectly cutting. For this purpoſe we agreed to meet him with our uſual ſmiles, to chat in the beginning with more than ordinary kindneſs, to amuſe him a little; but then in the midſt of the flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering calm to burſt upon him like an earthquake, and overwhelm him with the ſenſe of his own baſeneſs. This being reſolved upon, my wife undertook to manage the buſineſs herſelf, as ſhe really had ſome talents for ſuch an undertaking. We ſaw him approach, he entered, drew a chair, and ſate down.—"A fine day, Mr. Burchell." "A very fine day, Doctor; though I fancy we ſhall have ſome rain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> the ſhooting of my corns."—"The ſhooting of your horns," cried my wife, in a loud fit of laughter, and then aſked pardon for being fond of a joke.—"Dear madam," replied he, "I pardon you with all my heart; for I proteſt I ſhould not have thought it a joke till you told me."—" Perhaps not, Sir," cried my wife, "wink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at us, and yet I dare ſay you can tell us how many jokes go to an ounce."—"I fancy, madam,," returned Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chell, "you have been reading a jeſt book this morning, that ounce of jokes is ſo very good a conceit; and yet, madam, I had rather ſee half an ounce of underſtanding," —"I believe you might," cried my wife, ſtill ſmiling at us, tho' the laugh was againſt her; "and yet I have ſeen ſome men pretend to underſtanding that have very little." "And no doubt," replied her antagoniſt, "you have known ladies ſet up for wit that had none."—I quickly began to find that my wife was likely to gain but little at
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:012405_0065_0F8972CD326BD640"/>
this buſineſs; ſo I reſolved to treat him in a ſtile of more ſeverity myſelf. "Both wit and underſtanding," cried I, "are trifles, without integrity: it is that which gives value to every character. The ignorant peaſant, without fault, is greater than the philoſopher with many; for what is genius or courage without an heart? <hi>An honeſt man is the nobleſt work of God.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>"I always held that favourite maxim of Pope," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned Mr. Burchell, "as very unworthy a man of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, and a baſe deſertion of his own ſuperiority. As the reputation of books is raiſed not by their freedom from defect, but the greatneſs of their beauties; ſo ſhould that of men be prized, not for their exemption from fault, but the ſize of thoſe virtues they are poſſeſſed of. The ſcholar may want prudence, the ſtateſman may have pride, and the champion ferocity; but ſhall we prefer to theſe men the low mechanic, who laboriouſly plods on through life, without cenſure or applauſe? We might as well prefer the tame correct paintings of the Flemiſh ſchool to the erroneous, but ſublime animations of the Roman pencil."</p>
                     <p>"Sir," replied I, "your preſent obſervation is juſt, when there are ſhining virtues and minute defects; but when it appears that great vices are oppoſed in the ſame mind to as extraordinary virtues, ſuch a character de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves contempt."</p>
                     <p>"Perhaps," cried he, "there may be ſome ſuch mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters as you deſcribe, of great vices joined to great vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; yet in my progreſs through life, I never yet found one inſtance of their exiſtence: on the contrary, I have ever perceived, that where the mind was capacious, the affections were good. And indeed, Providence ſeems kindly our friend in this particular, thus to debilitate the underſtanding where the heart is corrupt, and diminiſh the power where there is the will to do miſchief. This rule ſeems to extend even to other animals: the little vermin race are ever treacherous, cruel, and cowardly, whilſt thoſe endowed with ſtrength and power are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, brave, and gentle."</p>
                     <p>"Theſe obſervations found well," returned I, "and yet it would be eaſy this moment to point out a man," and I fixed my eye ſtedfaſtly upon him," whoſe head and heart
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:012405_0066_0F8972CDF257C588"/>
form a moſt deteſtable contraſt. Ay, Sir, continued I, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing my voice, "and I am glad to have this opportunity of detecting him in the midſt of his fancied ſecurity. Do you know this, Sir, this pocket-book?"—"Yes, Sir" returned he with a face of impenetrable aſſurance, "that pocket-book is mine, and I am glad you have found it."— "And do you know," cried I, "this letter? Nay, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver falter, man; but look me full in the face: I ſay, do you know this letter?"—"That letter returned he, "yes, it was I that wrote that letter."—"And how could you," ſaid I, ſo baſely, ſo ungratefully preſume to write this letter?"—"And how came you," replied he, with looks of unparallelled effrontry, "ſo baſely to preſume to break open this letter? Don't you know, now I could hang you all for this? All that I have to do, is to ſwear at the next juſtice's, that you have been guilty of breaking open the lock of my pocket book, and ſo hang you all up at his door." This piece of unexpected inſolence, raiſed me to ſuch a pitch, that I could ſcarce govern my paſſion. "Ungrateful wretch, begone, and no longer pollute my dwelling with thy baſeneſs. Begone, and never let me ſee thee again; go from my doors, and the only puniſhment I wiſh thee, is an alarmed conſcience, which will be a ſufficient tormentor! ſo ſaying, I threw him his pocket-book, which he took up with a ſmile, and ſhutting the claſps with the utmoſt compoſure, left us, quite aſtoniſhed at the ſerenity of his aſſurance. My wife was particularly enraged that nothing could make him angry, or make him ſeem aſhamed of his villainies, "My dear," cried I, willing to calm thoſe paſſions that had been raiſed too high among us, we are not to be ſurpriſed that bad men want ſhame; they only bluſh at being detected in doing good, but glory in their vices."</p>
                     <p>"Guilt and ſhame ſays the allegory, were at firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, and in the beginning of their journey inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably kept together. But their union was ſoon found to be diſagreeable and inconvenient to both; guilt gave ſhame frequent uneaſineſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſhame often betrayed the ſecret conſpiracies of guilt. After long diſagreement, therefore, they at length conſented to part for ever. Guilt boldly walked forward alone, to overtake fate, that went before in the ſhape of an executioner: but ſhame

being naturally timorous, returned back to keeep compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with virtue, which, in the beginning of their journey, they had left behind.

                     <p>WHATEVER might have been Sophia's ſenſations, the reſt of the family was eaſily conſoled for Mr. Burchell's abſence, by the company of our landlord, whoſe viſits now became more frequent and longer. Though he had been diſappointed in procuring my daughters the amuſements of the town, as he deſigned, he took every opportunity of ſupplying them with thoſe little recreations which our retirement would admit of. He uſually came in the morning, and while my ſon and I followed our occupations abroad, he ſat with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily at home, and amuſed them by deſcribing the town, with every part of which he was particularly acquainted. He could repeat all the obſervations that were retailed in the atmoſphere of the play houſes, and had all the good things of the high wits by rote, long before they made way into the jeſt books. The intervals between converſation were employed in teaching my daughters pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, or ſometimes in ſetting my two little ones to box, to make them <hi>ſharp,</hi> as he called it: but the hopes of having him for a ſon-in-law, in ſome meaſure blinded us to all his defects. It muſt be owned, that my wife laid a thouſand ſchemes to entrap him, or, to ſpeak it more tenderly, uſed every art to magnify the merit of her daughter. If the cakes at tea eat ſhort and criſp, they were made by Olivia: if the gooſeberry wine was well
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:012405_0068_0F8972CF7396ECA8"/>
knit, the gooſeberries were of her gathering: it was her fingers gave the pickles their peculiar green; and in the compoſition of a pudding, her judgment was infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Then the poor woman would ſometimes tell the 'Squire, that ſhe thought him and Olivia extremely like each other, and would bid both ſtand up to ſee which was talleſt. Theſe inſtances of cunning, which ſhe thought impenetrable, yet which every body ſaw thro' were very pleaſing to our benefactor, who gave every day ſome new proofs of his paſſion, which though they had not ariſen to propoſals of marriage, yet we thought fell but little ſhort of it; and his ſlowneſs was attributed ſometimes to native baſhfulneſs, and ſometimes to his fear of offending a rich uncle. An occurrence, however, which happened ſoon after, put it beyond a doubt, that he deſigned to become one of the family, my wife even regarded it as an abſolute promiſe.</p>
                     <p>My wife and daughters happening to return a viſit to neighbour Flamborough's, found that family had lately got their pictures drawn by a limner, who travelled the country, and did them for fifteen ſhillings a head. As this family and ours had long a ſort of rivalry in point of taſte, our ſpirit took the alarm at this ſtolen march up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and notwithſtanding all I could ſay, and I ſaid much, it was reſolved that we ſhould have our pictures done too. Having, therefore, engaged the limner, for what could I do? Our next deliberation was to ſhew the ſuperiority of our taſte in the attitudes. As for our neighbour's family, there were ſeven of them, and they were drawn with ſeven oranges, a thing quite out of taſte, no variety in life, no compoſition in the world. We deſired to have ſomething done in a brighter ſtyle and, after many debates, at length came to an unanimous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to be drawn together, in one large hiſtorical fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily-piece. This would be cheaper, ſince one frame would ſerve for all, and it would be infinitely more gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teel; for all families of any taſte were now drawn in the ſame manner. As we did not immediately recollect an hiſtorical ſubject to hit us, we were contented each with being drawn as independant hiſtorical figures. My wife deſired to be repreſented as Venus, with a ſtomacher richly ſet with diamonds, and her two little ones as Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pids
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:012405_0069_0F8972D0333CC688"/>
by her ſide, while I, in my gown and band, was to preſent her with my books on the Bangorean controverſy. Olivia would be drawn as an Amazon, ſitting upon a bank of flowers, dreſt in a green joſeph, laced with gold, and a whip in her hand. Sophia was to be a ſhepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs with as many ſheep as the painter could ſpare; and Moſes was to be dreſt out with an hat and white fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Our taſte ſo much pleaſed the 'Squire, that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on being put in as one of the family, in the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Alexander the Great at Olivia's feet. This was conſidered by us all as an indication of his deſire to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced into the family in reality<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor could we refuſe his requeſt. The painter was therefore ſet to work, and as he wrought with aſſiduity and expedition, in leſs than four days the whole was compleated. The piece was large, and it muſt be owned he did not ſpare his colours; for which my wife gave him great encomiums. We were all perfectly ſatisfied with his performance; but an unfortunate circumſtance had not occured till the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was finiſhed, which now ſtruck us with diſmay. It was ſo very large, that we had no place in the houſe to fix it. How we all came to diſregard ſo material a point is inconceivable; but certain it is, we were this time all greatly over ſeen. Inſtead therefore of gratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our vanity as we hoped, there it leaned, in a moſt mortifying manner, againſt the kitchen wall, where the canvas was ſtretched and painted, much too large to be got through any of the doors, and the jeſt of all our neighbours. One compared it to Robinſon Cruſoe's long-boat, too large to be removed; another thought it more reſembled a reel in a bottle; ſome wondered how it ſhould be got out, and ſtill more were amazed how it ever got in.</p>
                     <p>But though it excited the ridicule of ſome, it effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally raiſed more ill-natured ſuggeſtions in many. The 'Squire's portrait being found united with ours, was an honour too great to eſcape envy. Malicious whiſpers began to circulate at our expence, and our tranquillity continually to be diſturbed by perſons who came as friends to tell us what was ſaid of us by enemies. Theſe reports we always reſented with becoming ſpirit; but ſcandal ever improves by oppoſition. We again there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:012405_0070_0F8972D0F7909430"/>
entered into a conſultation upon obviating the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of our enemies and at laſt came to a reſolution which had too much cunning to give me entire ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It was this: as our principal object was to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the honour of Mr. Thornhill's addreſſes, my wife undertook to ſound him, by pretending to aſk his advice in the choice of an huſband for her eldeſt daughter. If this was not found ſufficient to induce him to a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it was then fixed upon to terrify him with a rival, which it was thought would compel him, though never ſo refractory. To this laſt ſtep, however, I would by no means give my conſent, till Olivia gave me the moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn aſſurances, that ſhe would marry the perſon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided to rival him upon this occaſion, if Mr. Thornhill did not prevent it by taking her himſelf. Such was the ſcheme laid, which though I did not ſtrenuouſly oppoſe, I did not entirely approve.</p>
                     <p>The next time, therefore that Mr. Thornhill came to ſee us, my girls took care to be out of the way, in order to give their mama an opportunity of putting her ſcheme in execution; but they only retired to the next room, from whence they could over-hear the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; which my wife artfully introduced, by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving that one of the Miſs Flamboroughs was likely to have a very good match of it in Mr. Spanker. To this the 'Squire aſſenting, ſhe proceeded to remark, that they who had warm fortunes were always ſure of getting good huſbands: "But heaven help," continued ſhe, "the girls that have none. What ſignifies beauty, Mr. Thornhill? or what ſignifies all the virtue, and all the qualifications in the world, in this age of ſelf-intereſt? It is not, what is ſhe? but what has ſhe? is all the cry."</p>
                     <p>"Madam," returned he, "I highly approve the juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, as well as the novelty, of your remarks, and if I were a king, it ſhould be otherwiſe. It would then, indeed, be fine times with the girls without fortunes: our two young ladies ſhould be the firſt for whom I would provide."</p>
                     <p>"Ah, Sir!" returned my wife, "you are pleaſed to be facetious: but I wiſh I were a queen, and then I know where they ſhould look for an huſband. But now that you have put it into my head, ſeriouſly Mr. Thornhill, can't
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:012405_0071_0F8972D1B1BF0FC8"/>
you recommend me a proper huſband for my eldeſt girl? She is now nineteen years old, well grown and well edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, and in my humble opinion, does not want for parts."</p>
                     <p>Madam, replied he, "if I were to chuſe, I would find out a perſon poſſeſſed of every accompliſhment that can make an angel happy. One with prudence, fortune, taſte, and ſincerity, ſuch, madam, would be, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, the proper huſband." "Ah, Sir," ſaid ſhe, "but do you know of any ſuch perſon?"—No, madam," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned he, "it is impoſſible to know any perſon that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be her huſband: ſhe's too great a treaſure for one man's poſſeſſion, ſhe's a goddeſs. Upon my ſoul, I ſpeak what I think, ſhe's an angel."—" Ah, Mr. Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill, you only flatter my poor girl: but we have been thinking of marrying her to one of your tenants, whoſe mother is lately dead, and who wants a manager: you know whom I mean, farmer Williams: a warm man, Mr. Thornhill, able to give her good bread; ay, and who has ſeveral times made her propoſals: (which was actually the caſe) but, Sir concluded ſhe, I ſhould be glad to have your approbation of our choice."—"How, madam," replied he, "my approbation! My approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch a choice! Never! What! Sacrifice ſo much beauty, and ſenſe, and goodneſs, to a creature inſenſible of the bleſſing!

                     <head>CHAP. XVII. Scarce any virtue found to reſiſt the power of long and pleaſing temptation.</head>
                     <p>AS I only ſtudied my child's real happineſs, the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiduity of Mr. Williams pleaſed me, as he was in eaſy circumſtances, prudent and ſincere. It required but very little encouragement to revive his former paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; ſo that in an evening or two after, he and Mr. Thornhill met at our houſe, and ſurveyed each other for ſome time with looks of anger: but Williams owed his landlord no rent, and little regarded his indignation. Olivia, on her ſide, acted the coquet to perfection, if that might be called acting which was her real charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, pretending to laviſh all her tenderneſs on her new lover. Mr. Thornhill appeared quite dejected at this preference, and with a penſive air took leave, though I own it puzzled me to find him ſo much in pain as he appeared to be, when he had it in his power ſo eaſily to remove the cauſe, by declaring an honourable paſſion. But whatever uneaſineſs he ſeemed to endure, it could eaſily be perceived that Olivia's anguiſh was ſtill greater. After any of theſe interviews between her lovers, of which there were ſeveral<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe uſually retired to ſolitude, and there indulged her grief. It was in ſuch a ſituation I found her one evening, after ſhe had been for ſome time ſupporting a fictitious gaiety.—
<q>You now ſee, my child,</q> ſaid I,
<q>that your confidence in Mr. Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill's paſſion was all a dream: he permits the rivalry of another every way his inferior, though he knows it lies in his power to ſecure you by a candid declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of himſelf.</q> —"Yes, papa," returned ſhe,
<q>but he has his reaſons for this delay: I know he has. The ſincerity of his looks and words convince me of
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:012405_0073_0F8972D43AA0C230"/>
his real eſteem. A ſhort time, I hope, will diſcover the generoſity of his ſentiments, and convince you that my opinion of him has been more juſt than yours.</q> — "Olivia, my darling," returned I,
<q>every ſcheme that has been hitherto purſued to compel him to a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, has been propoſed and planned by yourſelf, nor can you in the leaſt ſay that I have conſtrained you. But you muſt not ſuppoſe, my dear, that I will be ever inſtrumental in ſuffering his honeſt rival to be the dupe of your ill-placed paſſion. Whatever time you require to bring your fancied admirer to an explanation ſhall be granted? but at the expira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that term, if he is ſtill regardleſs, I muſt abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely inſiſt that honeſt Mr. Williams ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded for his fidelity. The character which I have hitherto ſupported in life demand this from me, and my tenderneſs, as a parent, ſhall never influence my integrity as a man. Name then your day, let it be as diſtant as you think proper, and in the mean time take care to let Mr. Thornhill know the exact time on which I deſign delivering you up to another. If he really loves you, his own good ſenſe will readily ſuggeſt that there is but one method alone to prevent his loſing you for ever.</q> —This propoſal, which ſhe could not avoid conſidering as perfectly juſt, was readily agreed to. She again renewed her moſt poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive promiſe of marrying Mr. Williams, in caſe of the other's inſenſibility; and at the next opportunity, in Mr. Thornhill's preſence, that day month was fixed upon for her nuptials with his rival.</p>
                     <p>Such vigorous proceedings ſeemed to redouble Mr. Thornhill's anxiety; but what Olivia really ſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> gave me ſome uneaſineſs. In this ſtruggle between prudence and paſſion, her vivacity quite forſook her, and every oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of ſolitude was ſought, and ſpent in tears. One week paſſed away; but her lover made no efforts to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain her nuptials. The ſucceeding week he was ſtill aſſiduous; but not more open. On the third he diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued his viſits entirely, and inſtead of my daughter teſtifying any impatience, as I expected, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>e ſeemed to retain a penſive tranquillity, which I looked upon as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation. For my own part, I was now ſincerely pleaſed
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:012405_0074_0F8972D4B2563718"/>
with thinking that my child was going to be ſecured in a continuance of competence and peace, and frequently applauded her reſolution. It was within about four days of her intended nuptials that my little family at night were gathered round a charming fire, telling ſtories of the paſt, and laying ſchemes for the future. Buſied in forming a thouſand projects, and laughing at whatever folly came uppermoſt, "Well, Moſes," cried I,
<q>we ſhall ſoon, my boy, have a wedding in the family, what is your opinion of matters and things in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral?</q> — <q>My opinion, father, is, that all things go on very well; and I was juſt now thinking, that when ſiſter Livy is married to farmer Williams, we ſhall then have the loan of his cyder-preſs and brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tubs for nothing.</q>—"That we ſhall, Moſes," cried I,
<q>and he will ſing us Death and the Lady, to raiſe our ſpirits into the bargain.</q> — <q>He has taught that ſong to our Dick,</q> cried Moſes;
<q>and I think he goes thro' it very prettily.</q> — <q>Does he ſo,</q> cried I,
<q>then let us have it: where's little Dick; let him up with it boldly.</q> —My brother "Dick," cried Bill my youngeſt,
<q>is juſt gone out with ſiſter Livy; but Mr. Williams has taught me two ſongs, and I'll ſing them for you, papa. Which ſong do you chuſe, <hi>the Dying Swan,</hi> or the <hi>Elegy on the death of a mad Dog?</hi>
                        </q>
                        <q>The elegy, child by all means,</q> ſaid I,
<q>I never heard that yet; and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borah, my life, grief you know is dry, let us have a bottle of the beſt gooſeberry wine, to keep up our ſpirits. I have wept ſo much at all ſorts of elegies of late, that without an enlivening glaſs I am ſure this will overcome me; and Sophy, love, take your guitar, and thrum in with the boy a little.</q>

                        <q>A very good boy, Bill, upon my word, and an elegy that may truly be called tragical. Come, my children, here's Bill's health, and may he one day be a biſhop.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>"With all my heart," cried my wife;
<q>and if he but preaches as well as he ſings, I make no doubt of him. The moſt of his family, by the mother's ſide. could ſing a good ſong: it was a common ſaying in our country, that the family of the Blenkinſops could never look ſtraight before them, nor the Hugginſes blow out a candle; that there were none of the Grograms but could ſing a ſong, or of the Majorams but could tell a ſtory,</q> —"However that be," cried I,
<q>the moſt vulgar ballad of them all generally pleaſes me better than the fine modern odes, and things that petrify us in a ſingle ſtanza; productions that we at once deteſt and praiſe. Put the glaſs to your brother, Moſes. The great fault of theſe ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſts is, that they are in deſpair for griefs that give the ſenſible part of mankind very little pain. A lady loſes her lap dog, and ſo the ſilly poet runs home to verſify the diſaſter.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>"That may be the mode," cried Moſes,
<q>in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blimer compoſitions; but the Ranelagh ſongs that come down to us are perfectly familiar, and all caſt in the ſame mould: Collin meets Dolly, and they hold a dialogue together, he gives her a fairing to put in her hair, and ſhe preſents him with a noſegay, and then they go together to church, where they give good advice to young nymphs and ſwains to get married as faſt as they can.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>"And very good advice too," cried I,
<q>and I am told there is not a place in the world where advice can be given with ſo much propriety as there; for as it perſuades us to marry, it alſo furniſhes us with a wife, and ſurely that muſt be an excellent market, my boy, where we are told what we want, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with it when wanting.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>"Yes, Sir," returned Moſes,
<q>and I know but of two ſuch markets for wives in Europe, Ranelagh in England, and Fontarabia in Spain. The Spaniſh
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:012405_0077_0F8972D6F2024EA0"/>
market is open once a year, but our Engliſh wives are ſaleable every night.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>"You are right, my boy," cried his mother,
<q>Old England is the only place in the world for huſbands to get wives.</q> — <q>And for wives to manage their huſbands,</q> interrupted I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        <q>It is a proverb abroad, that if a bridge were built acroſs the ſea, all the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the Continent would come over to take pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern from ours; for there are no ſuch wives in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope as our own.</q>

                        <q>But let us have one bottle more, Deborah, my life, and Moſes give us a good ſong. What thanks do we not we owe to heaven for thus beſtowing tranquillity, health and competence. I think myſelf happier now than the greateſt monarch upon earth. He has no ſuch fire-ſide, nor ſuch pleaſant faces about it. Yes, Deborah, my dear, we are now growing old; but the evening of our life is likely to be happy. We are deſcended from anceſtors that knew no ſtain, and we ſhall leave a good and virtuous race of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren behind us. While we live they will be our ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and our pleaſure here, and when we die they will tranſmit our honour untainted to poſterity. Come, my ſon, we wait for your ſong: let us have a cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus. But where is my darling Olivia? That little cherub's voice is always ſweeteſt in the concert.</q>— Juſt as I ſpoke Dick came running in— <q>O papa, papa, ſhe is gone from us, ſhe is gone from us, my ſiſter Livy is gone from us, for ever.</q> — <q>Gone, child!</q> —Yes, ſhe is gone off with two gentlemen in

my children, go, and be miſerable and infamous; for my heart is broken within me!</q> —"Father," cried, my ſon, "is this your fortitude?"— <q>Fortitude, child! Yes, he ſhall ſee I have fortitude! Bring me my piſtols. I'll purſue the traitor. While he is on earth I'll purſue him. Old as I am, he ſhall find I can ſting him yet. The villain! The perſidious villain!</q> —I had by this time reached down my piſtols, when my poor wife, whoſe paſſions were not ſo ſtrong as mine, caught me in her arms.
<q>My deareſt, deareſt huſband,</q> cried ſhe,
<q>the bible is the only weapon that is fit for your old hands now. Open that my love, and read our anguiſh into patience, for ſhe has vilely deceived</q> —Her ſorrow repreſſed the reſt in ſilence.—"Indeed, Sir," reſumed my ſon, after a pauſe,
<q>your rage is too violent and unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. You ſhould be my mother's comforter, and you encreaſe her pain. It ill ſuited you and your reverend character thus to curſe your greateſt enemy: you ſhould not to have curſt the wretch, villain as he is.</q> —"I did not curſe him, child, did I?"— <q>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, Sir, you did, you curſt him twice.</q>— <q>Then may Heaven forgive me and him if I did! And now, my ſon, I ſee it was more than human benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence that firſt taught us to bleſs our enemies! Bleſt be his holy name for all the good he has given, and for that he has taken away. But it is not, it is not a ſmall diſtreſs that can wring tears from theſe old eyes, that have not wept for ſo many years. My child!— To undo my darling! May confuſion ſeize! Heaven forgive me, what am I about to ſay! You may remember, my love, how good ſhe was, and how charming; till this vile moment all her care was to make us happy. Had ſhe but died! But ſhe is gone, the honour of our family contaminated, and I muſt look out for happineſs in other worlds than here. But, my child, you ſaw them go off: perhaps he forced her away? If he forced her, ſhe may yet be innocent.</q> —"Ah no, Sir!" cried the child,
<q>he only kiſſed her, and called her his angel, and ſhe wept very much, and leaned upon his arm, and they drove off very faſt.</q> —"She's an ungrateful creature," cried
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:012405_0079_0F8972D871B7A558"/>
my wife, who could ſcarce ſpeak for weeping,
<q>to uſe us thus. She never had the leaſt conſtraint put upon her affections. The vile ſtrumpet has baſely deſerted her parents without any provocation, thus to bring your grey hairs to the grave, and I muſt ſhortly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this manner that night, the firſt of our real miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, was ſpent in the bitterneſs of complaint, and ill ſupported ſallies of enthuſiaſm. I determined, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to find out our betrayer, wherever he was, and reproach his baſeneſs. The next morning we miſſed our wretched child at breakfaſt, where ſhe uſed to give life and chearfulneſs to us all. My wife, as before, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to eaſe her heart by reproaches. "Never," cried ſhe,
<q>ſhall that vileſt ſtain of our family again darken thoſe harmleſs doors. I will never call her daughter more. No, let the ſtrumpet live with her vile ſeducer: She may bring us to ſhame, but ſhe ſhall never more deceive us.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>"Wife," ſaid I,
<q>do not talk thus hardly: my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of her guilt is as great as yours; but ever ſhall this houſe and this heart be open to a poor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning repentant ſinner. The ſooner ſhe returns from her tranſgreſſion, the more welcome ſhall ſhe be to me. For the firſt time the very beſt may err; art may perſuade, and novelty ſpread out its charm. The firſt fault is the child of ſimplicity; but every other the offspring of guilt. Yes, the wretched creature ſhall be welcome to this heart and this houſe, tho' ſtained with ten thouſand vices. I will again hearken to the muſic of her voice, again will I hang fondly on her boſom, if I find but repentance there. My ſon, bring hither my bible and my ſtaff; I will pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue her, wherever ſhe is, and tho' I cannot ſave her from ſhame, I may prevent the continuance of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</q>

                     <head>CHAP. XVIII. The purſuit of a father to reclaim a loſt child to virtue.</head>
                     <p>THO' the child could not deſcribe the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's perſon who handed his ſiſter into the poſt-chaiſe, yet my ſuſpicions tell entirely upon our young landlord, whoſe character for ſuch intrigues was but too well known. I therefore directed my ſteps towards Thornhill-caſtle. reſolving to upbraid him, and, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to bring back my daughter: but before I had reached his ſeat, I was met by one of my pariſhioners, who ſaid he ſaw a young lady reſembling my daughter in a poſt-chaiſe with a gentleman, whom, by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, I could only gueſs to be Mr. Burchell, and that they drove very faſt. This information, however, did by no means ſatisfy me. I therefore went to the young 'Squire's, and though it was yet early, inſiſted upon ſeeing him immediately: he ſoon appeared with the moſt open familiar air, and ſeemed perfectly amazed at my daughter's elopement, proteſting upon his honour that he was quite a ſtranger to it. I now therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned my former ſuſpicions, and could turn them only on Mr. Burchell, who I recollected had of late ſeveral private conferences with her: but the appearance of another witneſs left me no room to doubt of his villainy, who averred, that he and my daughter were actually gone towards the wells, about thirty miles off, where there was a great deal of company. Hearing this, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to purſue them there. I walked <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>g with ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs, and enquired of ſeveral by the way, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived no accounts, till entering the town, I was met by a perſon on horſeback, whom I remembered to have ſeen at the Squire's, and he aſſured me that if I followed them to the races, which were but thirty miles farther, I might depend upon overtaking them; for he had ſeen them dance there the night before, and the whole aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:012405_0081_0F8972DB01B82F80"/>
ſeemed charmed with my daughter's performance. Early the next day I walked forward to the races, and about four in the afternoon I came upon the courſe. The company made a very brilliant appearance, all ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly employed in one purſuit, that of pleaſure; how different from mine, that of reclaiming a loſt child to virtue! I thought I perceived Mr. Burchell at ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from me: but, as if he dreaded an interview, upon my approaching him, he mixed among a crowd, and I ſaw him no more. I now reflected that it would be to no purpoſe to continue my purſuit farther, and reſolved to return home to an innocent family, who wanted my aſſiſtance. But the agitations of my mind, and the fatigues I had undergone, threw me into a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the ſymptoms of which I perceived before I came off the courſe. This was another unexpected ſtroke, as I was more than ſeventy miles diſtant from home: however, I retired to a little ale-houſe by the road-ſide, and in this place, the uſual retreat of indigence and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality, I laid me down patiently to wait the iſſue of my diſorder. I languiſhed here for near three weeks; but at laſt my conſtitution prevailed, though I was unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with money to defray the expences of my enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment. It is poſſible the anxiety from this laſt cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance alone might have brought on a relapſe, had I not been ſupplied by a traveller, who ſtopt to take a curſory refreſhment. This perſon was no other than the philanthropic bookſeller in St. Paul's church-yard, who has written ſo many little books for children: he called himſelf their friend; but he was the friend of all mankind. He was no ſooner alighted, but he was in haſte to be gone; for he was ever on buſineſs of the utmoſt importance, and was at that time actually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piling materials for the hiſtory of one Mr. Thomas Trip. I immediately recollected this good-natured man's red pimpled face; for he had publiſhed for me againſt the Deuterogamiſts of the age, and from him I borrowed a few pieces, to be paid at my return. Leaving the inn, therefore, as I was yet but weak, I reſolved to return home by eaſy journeys of ten miles a day. My health and uſual tranquillity were almoſt reſtored, and I now condemned that pride which had made me refractory
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:012405_0082_0F8972DB75775508"/>
to the hand of correction. Man little knows what ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities are beyond his patience to bear till he tries them; as in aſcending the heights of ambition, which look bright from below, every ſtep we riſe ſhews us ſome new proſpect of hidden diſappointment; ſo in our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent to the vale of wretchedneſs, which, from the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of pleaſure appears dark and gloomy, the buſy mind ſtill attentive to its own amuſement, finds ſomething to flatter and ſurpriſe it. Still as we deſcend, the objects appear to brighten, unexpected proſpects amuſe, and the mental eye becomes adapted to its gloomy ſituation.</p>
                     <p>I now proceeded forwards, and had walked about two hours, when I perceived what appeared at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance like the waggon, which I was reſolved to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take; but when I came up with it, found it to be a ſtrolling company's cart, that was carrying their ſcenes and other theatrical furniture to the next village, where they were to exhibit. The cart was attended only by the perſon who drove it, and one of the company, as the reſt of the players were to follow the enſuing day. Good company upon the road, ſays the proverb, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the ſhorteſt cut, I therefore entered into conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation with the poor player; and as I once had ſome theatrical powers myſelf, I deſcanted on ſuch topics with my uſual freedom: but as I was pretty much unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the preſent ſtate of the ſtage, I demanded who where the preſent theatrical writers in vogue, who the Drydens and Otways of the day.— <q>I fancy, Sir,</q> cried the player,
<q>few of our modern drama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts would think themſelves much honoured by being compared to the writers you mention. Dryden and Rowe's manner, Sir, are quite out of faſhion; our taſte has gone back a whole century. Fletcher, Ben Johnſon, and all the plays of Shakeſpeare, are the only things that go down.</q> —"How," cried I,
<q>is it poſſible the preſent age can be pleaſed with that anti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>uated dialect that obſolete humour, thoſe over charged characters, which abound in the works you mentioned?</q> —"Sir," returned my companion,
<q>the publick think nothing about dialect, or humour, or character; for that is none of their buſineſs, they only go to be amuſed, and find themſelves happy
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:012405_0083_0F8972DC321453E8"/>
when they can enjoy a pantomime, under the ſanction of Johnſon's or Shakeſpear's name.</q> — <q>So then, I ſuppoſe,</q> cried I,
<q>that our modern dramatiſts are rather imitators of Shakeſpeare than of nature.</q> — "To ſay the truth," returned my companion,
<q>I don't know that they imitate any thing at all; nor indeed does the publick require it of them: it is not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the piece, but the number of ſtarts and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes that may be introduced into it that forces ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe. I have known a piece, with not one jeſt in the whole, ſhrugged into popularity, and another ſaved by the poet's throwing in a fit of the gripes. No, Sir, the works of Congreve and Farquhar have too much wit in them for the preſent taſte; our modern dialogue is much more natural.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>By this time the equipage of the ſtrolling company was arrived at the village, which, it ſeems, had been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed of our approach, and was come out to gaze at us; for my companion obſerved, that ſtrollers always have more ſpectators without doors than within. I did not conſider the impropriety of my being in ſuch company till I ſaw a mob gathered about me. I therefore took ſhelter, as faſt as poſſible, in the firſt ale-houſe that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and being ſhewn into the common room, was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſted by a very well-dreſt gentleman, who demanded whether I was the real chaplain of the company, or whether it was only to be my maſquerade character in the play. Upon informing him of the truth, and that I did not belong to the company, he was condeſcending enough to deſire me and the player to partake of a bowl of punch, over which he diſcuſſed modern politics with great earneſtneſs and ſeeming intereſt. I ſet him down in my own mind for nothing leſs than a parliament-man at leaſt; but was almoſt confirmed in my conjectures, when upon my aſking what there was in the houſe for ſupper, he inſiſted that the player and I ſhould ſup with him at his houſe, with which requeſt, after ſome entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, I was prevailed on to comply.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XIX. The deſcription of a perſon diſcontented with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent government, and apprehenſive of the loſs of our liberties.</head>
                     <p>THE houſe where we were to be entertained, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at a ſmall diſtance from the village, our invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter obſerved, that as the coach was not ready, he would conduct us on foot, and we ſoon arrived at one of the moſt magnificent manſions I had ſeen in the country. The apartment into which we were ſhewn was perfectly elegant and modern; he went to give orders for ſupper, while the player, with a wink, obſerved that we were perfectly in luck. Our entertainer ſoon returned, an elegant ſupper was brought in, two or three ladies, in an eaſy diſhabille, were introduced, and the converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on began with ſome ſprightlineſs. Politics, however, was the ſubject on which our entertainer chiefly expatiat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for he aſſerted that liberty was at once his boaſt and his terror. After the cloth was removed, he aſked me if I had ſeen the laſt Monitor, to which replying in the negative, "What, nor the Auditor, I ſuppoſe?" cried he. "Neither, Sir," returned I. "That's ſtrange, very ſtrange," replied my entertainer. Now, I read all the politics that come out. The Daily, the Public, the Ledger, the Chronicle, the London Evening, the Whitehall Evening, the ſeventeen magazines, and the two reviews; and though they hate each other, I love them all. Liberty, Sir, liberty is the Briton's boaſt, and by all my coal mines in Cornwall, I reverence its guardians." "Then it is to be hoped," cried I, "you reverence the king." "Yes," returned my entertainer, "when he does what we would have him; but if he goes on as he has done of late, I'll never trouble myſelf more with his matters. I ſay nothing. I think only. I could have directed ſome things better. I don't think there has been a ſufficient number of adviſers; he ſhould
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:012405_0085_0F8972DDB38AE2A0"/>
adviſe, with every perſon willing to give him advice, and then we ſhould have things done in another manner."</p>
                     <p>"I wiſh," cried I, "that ſuch intruding adviſers were fixed in the pillory. It ſhould be the duty of honeſt men to aſſiſt the weaker ſide of our conſtitution, that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred power that has for ſome years been every day de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining, and loſing its due ſhare of influence in the ſtate. But theſe ignorants ſtill continue the cry of liberty, and if they have any weight baſely throw it into the ſubſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcale."</p>
                     <p>"How," cried one of the ladies, "do I live to ſee one ſo baſe, ſo ſordid, as to be an enemy to liberty, and a defender of tyrants? Liberty, that ſacred gift of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that glorious privilege of Britons!"</p>
                     <p>"Can it be poſſible, cried our entertainer, "that there ſhould be any found at preſent advocates for ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very? Any who are for meanly giving up the privileges of Britons? Can any, Sir, be ſo abject?"</p>
                     <p>"No, Sir," replied I, "I am for liberty, that attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of Gods! Glorious liberty! that theme of modern declamation. I would have all men kings. I would be a king myſelf. We have all naturally an equal right to the throne: we are all originally equal. This is my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, and was once the opinion of a ſet of honeſt men who were called Levellers. They tried to erect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into a community, where all ſhould be equally free. But alas! it would never anſwer; for there were ſome among them ſtronger, and ſome more cunning than others, and theſe became maſters of the reſt; for as ſure as your groom rides your horſes, becauſe be is a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninger animal than they, ſo ſurely will the animal that is cunninger animal than they, ſo ſurely will the animal that is cunninger or ſtronger than he, ſit upon his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in turn. Since then it is entailed upon humanity to ſubmit, and ſome are born to command, and others to obey, the queſtion is, as there muſt be tyrants, whether it is better to have them in the ſame houſe with us, or in the ſame village, or ſtill farther off, in the metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis. Now, Sir, for my own part, as I naturally hate the face of a tyrant, the farther off he is removed from me, the better pleaſed am I. The generality of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind alſo are of my way of thinking, and have unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:012405_0086_0F8972DE73459C40"/>
created one King, whoſe election at once dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes the number of tyrants, and puts tyranny at the greateſt diſtance from the greateſt number of people. Now thoſe who were tyrants themſelves before the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one tyrant, are naturally averſe to a power raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over them, and whoſe weight muſt ever lean heavieſt on the ſubordinate orders. It is the intereſt of the great, therefore, to diminiſh kingly power as much as poſſible; becauſe whatever they take from it is naturally reſtored to themſelves; and all they have to do in a ſtate, is to undermine the ſingle tyrant, by which they reſume their primaeval authority. Now a ſtate may be ſo conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally circumſtanced, its laws may be ſo diſpoſed, and its men of opulence ſo minded, as all to conſpire to carry on this buſineſs of undermining monarchy. If the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the ſtate be ſuch, for inſtance, as to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the accumulation of wealth, and make the opulent ſtill more rich, this will encreaſe their ſtrength and their ambition. But an accumulation of wealth muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be the conſequence in a ſtate, when more riches flow in from external commerce, than ariſe from internal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry: for external commerce can only be managed to advantage by the rich, and they have alſo at the ſame time all the emoluments ariſing from internal induſtry: ſo that the rich, in ſuch a ſtate, have two ſources of wealth, whereas the poor have but one. Thus wealth in all commercial ſtates is found to accumulate, and ſuch have hitherto in time become ariſtocratical. Beſides this, the very laws of a country may contribute to the accumulation of wealth; as when thoſe natural ties that bind the rich and poor together are broken, and it is ordained that the rich ſhall only marry among each other; or when the learned are held unqualified to ſerve their country as merely from a defect of opulence, and wealth is thus made the object of a wiſe man's ambition, by theſe means I ſay, and ſuch means as theſe, riches will accumulate. The poſſeſſor of accumulated wealth, when furniſhed with the neceſſaries and pleaſures of life, can employ the ſuperfluity of fortune only in purchaſing power. That is, differently ſpeaking, in making de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants, in purchaſing the liberty of the needy or the venal, of men who are willing to bear the mortification
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:012405_0087_0F8972DF419BFCC0"/>
of contiguous tyranny for bread. Thus every very o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulent man generally gathers round him a circle of the pooreſt of the people; and the polity abounding in accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated wealth, may be compared to a Carteſian ſyſtem, each orb with a vortex of its own. Thoſe, however, who are willing to move in a great man's vortex, are only ſuch as muſt be ſlaves, the rabble of mankind, whoſe ſouls and whoſe education are adapted to ſervitude, and who know nothing of liberty except the name. But there muſt ſtill be a large number of the people without the ſphere of the opulent man's influence, namely, that order of men which ſubſiſts between the very rich and the very rabble; thoſe men who are poſſeſſed of two large fortunes to ſubmit to the neighbouring man in power, and yet are too poor to ſet up for tyranny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. In this middle order of mankind are generally to be found all the arts, wiſdom, and virtues of ſociety. This order alone is known to be the true preſerver of freedom, and may be called the People. Now it may happen that this middle order of mankind may loſe all its influence in a ſtate, and its voice be in a manner drowned in that of the rabble: for if the fortune ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for qualifying a perſon at preſent to give his voice in ſtate affairs, be ten times leſs than was judged ſufficient upon forming the conſtitution, it is evident that greater numbers of the rabble will thus be introduced into the political ſyſtem, and they, ever moving in the vortex of the great, will follow where greatneſs ſhall direct. In ſuch a ſtate, therefore, all that middle order has left, is to preſerve the prerogative and privileges of one princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal tyrant with the moſt ſacred circumſpection. For he divides the power of the rich, and calls off the great from falling with tenfold weight on the middle order placed beneath them. The middle order may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a town of which the opulent are forming the ſiege, and which the tyrant is haſtening to relieve. While the beſiegers are in dread of the external enemy, it is but natural to offer the townſmen the moſt ſpecious terms; to flatter them with ſounds, and amuſe them with privileges: but if they once defeat the tyrant, the walls of the town will be but a ſmall defence to its inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants. What they may then expect, may be ſeen by
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:012405_0088_0F8972DFF7EF0010"/>
turning our eyes to Holland, Genoa, or Venice, where the laws govern the poor, and the rich govern the law. I am then for, and would die for, monarchy, ſacred monarchy; for if there be any thing ſacred amongſt men, it muſt be the anointed ſovereign of his people, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diminution of his power in war, or in peace, is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringement upon the real liberties of the ſubject. The ſounds of liberty, patriotiſm, and Britons, have already done <hi>much;</hi> it is to be hoped that the true ſons of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom will prevent their ever doing more. I have known many of thoſe bold champions for liberty in my time, yet do I not remember one that was not in his heart and in his family a tyrant."</p>
                     <p>My warmth I found had lengthened this harangue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the rules of good breeding: but the impatience of my entertainer, who often ſtrove to interrupt it could be reſtrained no longer. "What," cried he, "then I have been all this while entertaining a Jeſuit in parſon's cloaths: but by all the coal mines of Cornwall, out he ſhall pack, if my name be Wilkinſon. I now found I had gone too far, and aſked pardon for the warmth with which I had ſpoken. "Pardon," returned he in a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: "I think ſuch principles demand ten thouſand par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons. What, give up liberty, property, and, as the Gazetteer ſays, lie down to be ſaddled with wooden ſhoes! Sir, I inſiſt upon your marching out of this houſe immediately to prevent worſe conſequences, Sir, I inſiſt upon it." I was going to repeat my remonſtrances; but juſt then we heard a footman's rap at the door, and the two ladies cried out, "As ſure as death there is our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and miſtreſs come home." It ſeems my entertainer was all this while only the butler, who, in his maſter's abſence, had a mind to cut a figure, and be for a while the gentleman himſelf; and to ſay the truth, he talked politics as well as moſt country gentleman do. But no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could now exceed my confuſion upon ſeeing the gentleman, with his lady, enter, nor was their ſurprize, at finding ſuch company and good cheer, leſs than ours. "Gentlemen," cried the real maſter of the houſe, to me and my companion, "I am your moſt humble ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; but I proteſt this is ſo unexpected a favour, that I almoſt ſink under the obligation." However unexpected

our company might be to him, his, I am ſure, was ſtill more to us, and I was ſtruck dumb with the apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of my own abſurdity, when whom ſhould I next ſee enter the room but my dear miſs Arabella Wilmot, who was formerly deſigned to be married to my ſon George; but whoſe match was broken off, as already related. As ſoon as ſhe ſaw me, ſhe flew to my arms with the utmoſt joy. "My dear ſir," cried ſhe, "to what happy acci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>dent is it that we owe ſo unexpected a viſit? I am ſure my uncle and aunt will be in raptures when they find they have the good Dr. Primroſe for their gueſt." Upon hearing my name, the old gentleman and lady very po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litely ſtept up, and welcomed me with moſt cordial hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitality. Nor could they forbear ſmiling upon being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the nature of my preſent viſit: but the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate butler, whom they at firſt ſeemed diſpoſed to turn away, was, at my interceſſion, forgiven.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Arnold and his lady, to whom the houſe belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed now, inſiſted upon having the pleaſure of my ſtay for ſome days, and as their niece, my charming pupil, whoſe mind, in ſome meaſure, had been formed under my own inſtructions, joined in their entreaties, I complied. That night I was ſhewn to a magnificent chamber, and the next morning early, Miſs Wilmot deſired to walk with me in the garden, which was decorated in the modern manner. After ſome time ſpent in pointing out the beauties of the place, ſhe enquired with ſeeming uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, when laſt I had heard from my ſon George.
<q>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las! Madam,</q> cried I,
<q>he has now been near three years abſent, without ever writing to his friends or me. Where he is I know not; perhaps I ſhall never ſee him or happineſs more. No, my dear Madam, we ſhall never more ſee ſuch plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing hours as were once ſpent by our fire-ſide at Wakefield. My little family are now diſperſing very faſt, and poverty has brought not only want, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy upon us.</q> The good-natured girl let fall a tear at this account; but as I ſaw her poſſeſſed of too much ſenſibility, I forbore a more minute detail of our ſufferings. It was, however, ſome conſolation to me to find that time had made no alteration in her affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and that ſhe had rejected ſeveral matches that had
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:012405_0090_0F8972E27B728568"/>
been made her ſince our leaving her part of the country. She led me round all the extenſive improvements of the place, pointing to the ſeveral walks and arbours, and at the ſame time catching from every object a hint for ſome new queſtion relative to my ſon. In this manner we ſpent the forenoon, till the bell ſummoned us in to dinner, where we found the manager of the ſtrolling company, who was come to diſpoſe of tickets for the Fair Penitent, which was to be acted that evening, the part of Horatio by a young gentleman who had never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared on any ſtage before. He ſeemed to be very warm in the praiſes of the new performer, and averred, that he never ſaw any who bid ſo fair for excellence. Acting he obſerved was not learned in a day;
<q>But this gentleman,</q> continued he,
<q>ſeems born to tread the ſtage. His voice, his figure, and attitudes, are all admirable. We caught him up accidentally in our journey down.</q> This account in ſome meaſure, excited our curioſity, and, at the entreaty of the ladies, I was prevailed upon to accompany them to the play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, which was no other than a barn. As the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with which I went was inconteſtably the chief of the place, we were received with the greateſt reſpect, and placed in the front ſeat of the theatre; where we ſat for ſome time with no ſmall impatience to ſee Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio make his appearance. The new perfomer ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced at laſt, and I found it was my unfortunate ſon. He was going to begin, when, turning his eyes upon the audience, he perceived us, and ſtood at once ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and immoveable. The actors behind the ſcenes, who aſcribed this pauſe to his natural timidity, attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to encourage him; but inſtead of going on, he burſt into a flood of tears, and retired off the ſtage. I don't know what were the ſenſations I felt; for they ſucceeded with too much rapidity for deſcription: but I was ſoon awaked from this diſagreeable reverie by Miſs Wilmot, who, pale and with a trembling voice, deſired me to conduct her back to her uncle's. When got home, Mr. Arnold, who was as yet a ſtranger to our extraordinary behaviour, being informed that the new performer was my ſon, ſent his coach, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation, for him; and as he perſiſted in his refuſal to
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:012405_0091_0F8972E2F253AEA8"/>
appear again upon the ſtage, the players put another in his place, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e ſoon had him with us. Mr. Arnold gave him the kindeſt reception, and I received him with my uſual tranſport; for I could never counterfeit falſe reſentment. Miſs Wilmot's reception was mixed with ſeeming neglect, and yet I could perceive ſhe acted a ſtudied part. The tumult in her mind ſeemed not yet abated; ſhe ſaid twenty giddy things that looked like joy, and then laughed loud at her own want of meaning. At intervals ſhe would take a ſly peep at the glaſs, as if happy in the conſciouſneſs of unreſiſting beauty, and often would aſk queſtions, without giving any manner of attention to the anſwers.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. I. The hiſtory of a philoſophic vagabond, purſuing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty, but loſing content.</head>
                     <p>AFTER we had ſupped, Mrs. Arnold politely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to ſend a couple of her footmen for my ſon's baggage, which he at firſt ſeemed to decline; but upon her preſſing the requeſt, he was obliged to inform her, that a ſtick and a wallet were all the moveable things upon this earth that he could boaſt of. "Why, aye, my ſon," cried I, "you left me but poor, and poor I find you are come back; and yet I make no doubt you have ſeen a great deal of the world."— "Yes, Sir," replied my ſon, "but travelling after for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, is not the way to ſecure her; and, indeed, of late, I have deſiſted from the purſuit,"—"I fancy Sir," cried Mrs Arnold," "that the account of your adventures would be amuſing: the firſt part of them I have often heard from my niece: but could the company prevail for the reſt, it would be an additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal obligation."—"Madam," replied my ſon, "I can promiſe you the pleaſure you have in hearing, will not be half ſo great as my vanity in the recital and yet in the whole narrative I can ſcarce promiſe you one adventure, as my account is not of what I did, but what I ſaw. The firſt misfortune of my life, which you all know was great; but tho' it diſtreſſed, it could not ſink me. No perſon ever had a better knack at hoping than I. The leſs kind I found fortune then, the more I expected from her another time, and being now at the bottom of her wheel, every new revolution might lift, but could not depreſs me. I proceeded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, towards London in a fine morning no way uneaſy about to morrow, but chearful as the birds that caroll'd by the road. I comforted myſelf with various reflections,
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:012405_0094_0F8972E532000898"/>
that London was the true mart where abilities of every kind were ſure of meeting diſtinction and reward.</p>
                     <p>"Upon my arrival in town, Sir, my firſt care was to deliver your letter of recommendation to your couſin who was himſelf in little better circumſtances than me. My firſt ſcheme, you know, Sir, was to be the uſher at an academy, and I aſked his advice on the affair. Our couſin received the propoſal with a true Sardonic grin. Aye, cried he, this is a pretty career, indeed, that has been chalked out for you. I have been once an uſher at a boarding ſchool myſelf; and may I die by an anodyne necklace, but I had rather be an under turnkey in Newgate. I was up early and late: I was brow-beat by the maſter, hated for my ugly face by the miſtreſs, worried by the boys within and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver permitted to ſtir out to meet civility abroad. But are you ſure you are fit for a ſchool? Let me examine you a little. Have you been bred apprentice to the buſineſs? No. Then you won't do for a ſchool. Can you dreſs the boys hair? No. Then you won't do for a ſchool. Have you had the ſmall pox? No. Then you won't do for a ſchool. Can you lie three in a bed? No. Then you will never do for a ſchool? H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ve you got a good ſtomach? Yes. Then you will by no means do for a ſchool. No, Sir, if you are fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> genteel eaſy profeſſion bind yourſelf ſeven years as an apprentice to turn a cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler's wheel; but avoid a ſchool by any means. But come, continued he, I ſee you are a lad of ſpirit and ſome learning, what do you think of commencing au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, like me? You have read in books, no doubt, of men of genius ſtarving at the trade: but at preſent I'll ſhew you forty very dull fellows about town that live by it in opulence. All honeſt jogg trotmen, who go on ſmoothly and dully, and write hiſtory and politics, and are praiſed; and who, had they been bred coblers, would all their lives have only mended ſhoes, but never made them."</p>
                     <p>"Finding that there was no great degree of gentility affixed to the character of an uſher, I reſolved to accept his propoſal; and having the higheſt reſpect for literature, I hailed the antiqua mater of Grub-ſtreet with reverence. I thought it my glory to purſue a track which Dryden
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:012405_0095_0F8972E5F1F828F8"/>
and Otway trod<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before me. In fact, I conſidered the goddeſs of this region as the parent of excellence; and however an intercourſe with the world might give us good ſenſe, the poverty ſhe granted was the nurſe of genius! Big with theſe reflections, I ſat down, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the beſt things remained to be ſaid on the wrong ſide, I reſolved to write a book that ſhould be wholly new. I therefore dreſt up three paradoxes with ſome ingenuity. They were falſe, indeed, but they were new. The jewels of truth have been ſo often imported by others, that nothing was left for me to import but ſome ſplendid things that at a diſtance looked every bit as well. Witneſs you powers what fancied importance ſat perched upon my quill while I was writing. The whole learned world, I made no doubt, would riſe to oppoſe my ſyſtems; but then I was prepared to oppoſe the whole learned world. Like the porcupine I ſat ſelf collected, with a quill pointed againſt every oppoſer"</p>
                     <p>"Well ſaid my boy," cried I, "and what ſubject did you treat upon? I hope you did not paſs over the importance of Hierarchial monogamy. But I interrupt, go on; you publiſhed your paradoxes; well, and what did the learned world ſay to your paradoxes?"</p>
                     <p>"Sir," replied my ſon, "the learned world ſaid nothing to my paradoxes? nothing at all, Sir. Every man of them was employed in praiſing his friends and himſelf, or condemning his enemies; and unfortunately, as I had neither, I ſuffered the cruelleſt mortification, neglect."</p>
                     <p>"As I was meditating one day in a coffee-houſe on the fate of my paradoxes, a little man happening to enter the room, placed himſelf in the box before me, and after ſome preliminary diſcourſe, finding me to be a ſcholar, drew out a bundle of propoſals, begging me to ſubſcribe to a new edition he was going to give the world of Propertius, with notes. This demand neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily produced a reply that I had no money; and that conceſſion led him on to enquire into the nature of my expectations. Finding that my expectations were juſt as great is my p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I'll teach you a part of it. Look at theſe propoſals, upon theſe very propoſals I have ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:012405_0096_0F8972E6C292C488"/>
very comfortably for twelve years. The moment a nobleman returns from his travels, a Creolian arrives from Jamaica, or a dowager from her country ſeat, I ſtrike for a ſubſcription. I firſt beſiege their hearts with flattery, and then pour in my propoſals at the breach. If they ſubſcribe readily the firſt time, I renew my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt to beg a dedication fee. If they let me have that, I ſmite them once more for engraving their coat of arms at the top. Thus, continued he, I live by vanity and laugh at it. But between ourſelves, I am now too well known, I ſhould be glad to borrow your face a bit: a nobleman of diſtinction has juſt returned from Italy; my face is familiar to his porter; but if you bring this copy of verſes, my life for it you ſucceed, and we divide the ſpoil."</p>
                     <p>"Bleſs us, George," cried I, "and is that the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of poets now! Do men of their exalted talents thus ſtoop to beggary! Can they ſo far diſgrace their calling, as to make a vile traffic of praiſe for bread!"</p>
                     <p>"O no, Sir," returned he, "a true poet can never be ſo baſe; for wherever there is genius there is pride. The creatures I now deſcribe are only beggars in rhyme. The real poet, as he braves every hardſhip for fame, ſo he is equally a coward to contempt, and none but thoſe who are unworthy protection condeſcend to ſolicit it."</p>
                     <p>"Having a mind too proud to ſtoop to ſuch indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and yet a fortune too humble to hazard a ſecond attempt for fame, I was now obliged to take a middle courſe, and write for bread. But I was unqualified for a profeſſion where mere induſtry alone could enſure ſucceſs. I could not ſuppreſs my lurking paſſion for applauſe: but uſually conſumed that time in efforts after excellence which takes up but little room, when it ſhould have been more advantageouſly employed in the diffuſive productions of fruitful mediocrity. My little piece would come forth in the midſt of a periodical publication, unno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed and unknown. The public were more importantly employed, than to obſerve the eaſy ſimplicity of my ſtyle, or the harmony of my periods. Sheet after ſheet was thrown off to oblivion. My eſſays were buried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the eſſays upon liberty, eaſtern ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Philelutheros, and Philanthropos, all wrote better, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they wrote faſter, than I."</p>
                     <p>"Now, therefore, I began to aſſociate with none but diſappointed authors, like myſelf, who praiſed, deplored, and deſpiſed each other. The ſatisfaction we found in every celebrated writer's attempts, was inverſely as their merits. I found that no genius in another could pleaſe me. My unfortunate paradoxes had entirely dried up that ſource of comfort. I could neither read nor write with ſatisfaction; for excellence in another was my averſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and writing was my trade."</p>
                     <p>"In the midſt of theſe gloomy reflections, as I was one day ſitting on a bench in St. James's park, a young gentleman of diſtinction who had been my intimate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance at the univerſity, approached me. We ſalut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed each other with ſome heſitation, he almoſt aſhamed of being known to one who made ſo ſhabby an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and I afraid of a repulſe. But my ſuſpicions ſoon vaniſhed; for Ned Thornhill was at the bottom a very good-natured fellow."</p>
                     <p>"What did you ſay, George?" interrupted I. "Thornhill, was not that his name? it can certainly be no other than my landlord."—"Bleſs me," cried Mrs. Arnold, "is Mr. Thornhill ſo near a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of yours? He has long been a friend in our family, and we expect a viſit from him ſhortly."</p>
                     <p>"My friend's firſt care," continued my ſon, "was to alter my appearance by a very fine ſuit of his own cloaths, and then I was admitted to his table upon the footing of half-friend, half-underling. My buſineſs was to attend him at auctions, to put him in ſpirits when he ſat for his picture, to take the left hand in his chariot when not filled by another, and to aſſiſt at tatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a kip, as the phraſe was, when we had a mind for a frolic. Beſides this, I had twenty other little employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the family. I was to do many ſmall things without bidding; to carry the corkſcrew; to ſtand god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father to all the butler's children; to ſing when I was bid; to be never out of humour; always to be humble, and, if I cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

a rival. A captain of marines, who ſeemed formed for the place by nature, oppoſed me in my patron's af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. His mother had been laundreſs to a man of quality, and thus he early acquired a taſte for pimping and pedigree. As this gentleman made it the ſtudy of his life to be acquainted with lords, though he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed from ſeveral for his ſtupidity; yet he found many of them who permitted his aſſiduities, being as dull as himſelf. As flattery was his trade, he practiſed it with the eaſieſt addreſs imaginable; but it came aukward and ſtiff from me; and as every day my patron's deſire of flattery encreaſed, ſo every hour being better acquainted with his defects, I became more unwilling to give it. Thus I was once more fairly going to give up the field to the captain, when my friend found occaſion for my aſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. This was nothing leſs than to fight a duel for him, with a gentleman whoſe ſiſter it was pretended he had uſed ill. I readily complied with his requeſt, and tho' I ſee you are diſpleaſed at my conduct, yet as it was a debt indiſpenſably due to friendſhip, I could not refuſe. I undertook the affair diſarmed my antagoniſt, and ſoon after had the pleaſure of finding that the lady was only a woman of the town, and the fellow her bully and a ſharper. This piece of ſervice was repaid with the warmeſt profeſſions of gratitude; but as my friend was to leave town in a few days, he knew no other method to ſerve me, but by recommending me to his uncle Sir William Thornhill, and another nobleman of great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction, who enjoyed a poſt under the government. When he was gone, my firſt care was to carry his recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendatory letter to his uncle, a man whoſe character for every virtue was univerſal yet juſt. I was received by his ſervants <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

that my preſent refuſal may be ſome puniſhment for your guilt; but ſtill more, that it may be ſome induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to your repentance.—The ſeverity of this rebuke I bore patiently, becauſe I knew it was juſt. My whole expectations now, therefore, lay in my letter to the great man. As the doors of the nobility are almoſt ever beſet with beggars, all ready to thruſt in ſome ſly petition, I found it no eaſy matter to gain admittance. However, after bribing the ſervants with half my worldly fortune, I was at laſt ſhewn into a ſpacious apartment, my letter being previouſly ſent up for his lordſhip's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection. During this anxious interval I had full time to look round me. Every thing was grand, and of happy contrivance: the paintings, the furniture, the gildings, petrified me with awe, and raiſed my idea of the owner. Ah, thought I to myſelf, how very great muſt the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor of all theſe things be, who carries in his head the buſineſs of the ſtate, and whoſe houſe diſplays half the wealth of a kingdom: ſure his genius muſt be unfathom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able! During theſe awful reflections I heard a ſtep come heavily forward. Ah, this is the great man himſelf; No, it was only a chambermaid. Another foot was heard ſoon after. This muſt be He!

His lordſhip, however, went too faſt for us, and was gaining his chariot door with large ſtrides, when I hallooed out to know if I was to have any reply. He was by this time got in, and muttered an anſwer, half of which only I heard, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"My patience," continued my ſon, "was now quite exhauſted: ſtung with the thouſand indignities I had met with, I was willing to caſt myſelf away, and only wanted the gulph to receive me. I regarded myſelf as one of thoſe vile things that nature deſigned ſhould be thrown by into her lumber room, there to periſh in unpitied ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity. I had ſtill however, half a guninea left, and of that I thought fortune herſelf ſhould not deprive me: but in order to be ſure of this I was reſolved to go inſtantly and ſpend it while I had it, and then truſt to occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for the reſt. As I was going along with this reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it happened that Mr. Cripſe's office ſeemed invit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly open to give me a welcome reception. In this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice Mr. Cripſe kindly offers all his majeſty's ſubjects a generous promiſe of 30 l. a year, for which promiſe all they give in return is their liberty for life, and permiſſion to let him tranſport them to America as ſlaves. I was hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py at finding a place where I could loſe my fears in deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, and therefore entred this cell; for it had the appearance of one, being dark, damp, and dirty. Here I found a number of poor creatures, all in circumſtances like myſelf, expecting the arival of Mr. Cripſe, preſenting a true epitome of Engliſh impatience. Each untractable ſoul at variance with fortune, wre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He deigned to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard me with an air of peculiar approbation, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he was the firſt man who for a month paſt talked to me with ſmiles. After a few queſtions, he found I was fit for every thing in the world. He pauſed a while up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the propereſt means of providing for me, and ſlap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping his forehead, as if he had found it, aſſured me, that there was at that time an embaſſy talked of from the ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod of Pennſylvania to the Chickaſaw Indians, and that he would uſe his intereſt to get me made ſecretary. I knew in my own heart that the fellow lied, and yet his promiſe gave me pleaſure, there was ſomething ſo mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent in the ſound. I fairly, therefore, divide <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"As I was going out with that reſolution, I was met at the door by the captain of a ſhip, with whom I had formerly ſome little acquaintance, and he agreed to be my companion over a bowl of punch. As I never choſe to make a ſecret of my circumſtances, he aſſured me that I was upon the very point of ruin, in liſtening to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice-keeper's promiſes; for that he only deſigned to ſell me to the plantations."

The moment you land all you have to do is to teach the Dutchmen Engliſh, and I'll warrant you'll get pupils and money enough. I ſuppoſe you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand Engliſh," added he, "by this time, or the duece is in it." I confidently aſſured him of that; but expreſſed a doubt whether the Dutch would be willing to learn Engliſh. He affirmed with an oath that they were fond of it to diſtraction; and upon that affirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I agreed with his propoſal, and embarked the next day to teach the Dutch Engliſh in Holland. The wind was fair, our voyage ſhort, and after having paid my paſſage with half my moveables, I found myſelf, fallen as if from the ſkies, a ſtranger in one of the principal ſtreets of Amſterdam. In this ſituation I was unwilling to let any time paſs unemployed in teaching. I addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed myſelf therefore to two or three of thoſe I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>et, whoſe appearance ſeemed moſt promiſing; but it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make ourſelves mutually underſtood. It was not till this very moment I recollected, that in order to teach Dutchmen Engliſh, it was neceſſary that they ſhould firſt teach me Dutch. How I came to overlook ſo obvious an objection, is to me amazing; but certain it is I over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked it.</p>
                     <p>This ſcheme thus blown up, I had ſome thoughts of fairly ſhipping back to England again; but happening into company with an Iriſh ſtudent, who was returning from Louvain, our converſation turning upon topics of literature, (for by the way it may be obſerved, that I always forgot the meanneſs of my circumſtances when I
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:012405_0102_0F89732133A36410"/>
could converſe upon ſuch ſubjects) from him I learned that there were not two men in his whole univerſity who underſtood Greek. This amazed me. I inſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to travel to Louvain, and there live by teaching Greek; and in this deſign I was heartened by my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtudent, who threw out ſome hints that a fortune might be got by it.</p>
                     <p>I ſet boldly forward the next morning. Every day leſſened the burthen of my moveables, like Aeſop and his baſket of bread; for I paid them for my lodgings to the Dutch as I travelled on. When I came to Louvain, I was reſolved not to go ſneaking to the lower profeſſors, but openly tendered my talents to the principal himſelf. I went, had admittance, and offered him my ſervice as a maſter of the Greek language, which I had been told was a deſideratum in his univerſity. The <hi>principal</hi> ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at firſt to doubt of my abilities; but of theſe I offered to convince him, by turning a part of any Greek author he ſhould fix upon into Latin. Finding me perfectly ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt in my propoſal, he addreſſed me thus: "You ſee me, young man," continued he, I never learned Greek, and I don't find that I ever miſſed it. I have had a doctor's cap and gown without Greek: I have ten thouſand flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rins a year without Greek: and I eat heartily without Greek. In ſhort," continued he, "I don't know Greek, and I do not believe there is any uſe in it."</p>
                     <p>I was now too far from home to think of returning: ſo I reſolved to go forward. I had ſome knowledge of muſic, with a tolerable voice, and now turned what was once my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>ſement into a preſent means of bare ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. I paſſed among the harmleſs peaſants of Flanders, and among ſuch of the French as were poor enough to be very merry; for I ever found them ſprightly in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to their wants. Whenever I approached a pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant's houſe towards night-fall, I played one of my moſt merry tunes, and that procured me not only a lodging, but ſubſiſtence for the next day. I once or twice at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to play for people of faſhion; but they ſtill thought my performance odious, and never rewarded me even with a trifle. This was to me the more extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, as whenever I uſed formerly to play for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, when playing was my amuſement, my muſic never
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:012405_0103_0F897321F13A62F0"/>
failed to throw them into raptures, and the ladies eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially; but as it was now my only means, it was receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with contempt: a proof how ready the world is to under-rate thoſe talents which a man lives by.</p>
                     <p>In this manner I proceeded to Paris, with no deſign but juſt to look about me, and then to go forward. The people of Paris are much fonder of ſtrangers that have money, than of thoſe that have wit. You may imagine then, as I could not boaſt much of either, that I was no great favourite. After I had walked about the town four or five days, and ſeen the outſides of the beſt houſes, I was preparing to leave this retreat of venal hoſpitality, when paſſing through one of the principal ſtreets, whom ſhould I meet but our couſin, to whom you firſt recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended me. This meeting was very agreeable to me, and I believe not diſpleaſing to him. He enquired into the nature of my journey to Paris, and informed me of his buſineſs there, which was to collect pictures, medals, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taglios, and antiques of all kinds, for a gentleman in London, who had juſt ſtept into taſte and a large for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. I was ſtill more ſurpriſed at ſeeing our couſin pitched upon for this office, as himſelf had often aſſured me he knew nothing of the matter. Upon my aſking how he had been taught the art of a connoſcento ſo very ſuddenly, he aſſured me that nothing was more eaſy. The whole ſecret conſiſted in a ſtrict adherence to two rules: the one always to obſerve, that the picture might have been better if the painter had taken more pains; and the other, to praiſe the works of Pietro<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Perugino. But, ſays he, as I once taught you how to be an author in London, I'll now undertake to inſtruct you in the art of picture buying at Paris.</p>
                     <p>With this propoſal I very readily cloſed, as it was a living, and now all my ambition was to live. I went therefore to his lodgings, improved my dreſs by his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, and after ſome time, accompanied him to auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of pictures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where the Engliſh gentry were expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be purchaſers. I was not a little ſurpriſed at his intimacy with people of the beſt faſhion, who referred themſelves to his judgment upon every picture or medal, as to an unerring ſtandard of taſte. He made very good uſe of my aſſiſtance upon theſe occaſions; for when aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:012405_0104_0F897322B308E160"/>
his opinion, he would gravely take me aſide, and aſk mine, ſhrug, look wiſe, return, and aſſure the company, that he could give no opinion upon an affair of ſo much importance. Yet there was ſometimes an occaſion for a more ſupported aſſurance. I remember to have ſeen him, after giving his opinion that the colouring of a picture was not mellow enough, very deliberately take a bruſh with brown varniſh, that was accidently lying in the place, and rub it over the piece with great compoſure before all the company, and then aſk if he had not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the tints.</p>
                     <p>When he had finiſhed his commiſſion in Paris, he left me ſtrongly recommended to ſeveral men of diſtinction, as a perſon very proper for a travelling tutor; and I was after ſome time employed in that capacity by a gentleman who brought his ward to Paris, in order to ſet him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward on his tour through Europe. I was to be the young gentleman's governor, with this injunction, that he ſhould always be permitted to direct himſelf. My pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pil in fact underſtood the art of guiding in money con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns much better than I. He was heir to a fortune of about two hundred thouſand pounds, left him by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle in the Weſt-Indies; and his guardians, to qualify him for the management of it, had bound him appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to an attorney. Thus avarice was his prevailing paſſion: all his queſtions on the road were, how money might be ſaved; which was the leaſt expenſive courſe of travel; whether any thing could be bought that would turn to account when diſpoſed of again in London. Such curioſities on the way as could be ſeen for nothing he was ready enough to look at; but if the ſight was to be paid for, he uſually aſſerted that he had been told it was not worth ſeeing. He never paid a bill, that he would not obſerve, how amazingly expenſive travelling was, and all this though he was not yet come to the age of twenty-one. When arrived at Leghorn, as we took a walk to look at the port and ſhipping, he enquired the expence of the paſſage by ſea home to England. This he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed was but a trifle, compared to his returning by land, he was therefore unable to withſtand the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſo paying me the ſmall part of my ſalary that was then due, he took leave, and embarked with only one attendant for London.</p>

However my ſkill in muſic could avail me nothing in a country where every peaſant was a better muſician than I; but by this time I had acquired another talent, which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered my purpoſe as well, and this was a ſkill in diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. In all the foreign univerſities and convents, there are upon certain days philoſophical theſes maintained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt every adventitious diſputant; for which, if the champion oppoſes with any dexterity, he can claim a gratuity in money, a dinner, and a bed for one night. In this manner therefore I fought my way towards Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, walked along from city to city, examined man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind more nearly, and, if I may ſo expreſs it, ſaw both ſides of the picture. My remarks however, were few: I found that monarchy was the beſt government for the poor to live in, and common wealths for the rich. I found that riches in general were in every country ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther name for freedom; and that no man is ſo fond of freedom himſelf that he would not chuſe to ſubject the will of ſome individuals of ſociet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The company ſeemed not much to diſapprove of me for an aſſociate. They all, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, apprized me of the importance of the taſk at which I aimed; that the public was a many headed monſter, and that only ſuch as had very good heads could pleaſe it: that acting was not to be learned in a day; and that without ſome traditional ſhrugs, which had been on the ſtage, and only on the ſtage, theſe hundred years, I could never pretend to pleaſe. The next difficulty was in fitting me with parts, as almoſt every character was in keeping. I was driven, for ſome time, from one cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter to another, till at laſt Horatio was fixed upon, which the preſence of the preſent company happily hindered me from acting."</p>

                     <head>CHAP. II. The ſhort continuance of friendſhip amongſt the vicious, which is coeval only with mutual ſatisfaction.</head>
                     <p>MY ſon's account was too long to be delivered at once, the firſt part of it was begun that night, and he was concluding the reſt after dinner the next day, when the appearance of Mr. Thornhill's equipage at the door ſeemed to make a pauſe in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſatisfaction. The butler, who was now become my friend in the family, informed me with a whiſper, that the 'Squire had already made ſome overtures to Miſs Wilmot, and that her aunt and uncle ſeemed high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to approve the match. Upon Mr. Thornhill's enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he ſeemed, at ſeeing my ſon and me, to ſtart back; but I readily imputed that to ſurprize, and not diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. However, upon our advancing to ſalute him, he returned our greeting with the moſt apparent candour; and after a ſhort time, his preſence ſeemed only to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the general good humour.</p>
                     <p>After tea he called me aſide, to enquire after my daughter; but upon my informing him that my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry was unſucceſsful, he ſeemed greatly ſurpriſed; adding, that he had been ſince frequently at my houſe, in order to comfort the reſt of my family, whom he left perfectly well. He then aſked if I had communicated her misfortune to Miſs Wilmot, or my ſon; and upon my replying that I had not told them as yet, he greatly approved my prudence and precaution, deſiring me by all means to keep it a ſecret; "For at beſt," cried he,
<q>it is but divulging one's own infamy; and perhaps Miſs Livy may not be ſo guilty as we all imagine.</q> We were here interrupted by a ſervant, who came to aſk the 'Squire in, to ſtand up at country dances; ſo that he left me quite pleaſed with the intereſt he ſeemed to take in my concerns. His ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes,
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:012405_0107_0F8973255334EA78"/>
however, to Miſs Wilmot, were too obvious to be miſtaken; and yet ſhe ſeemed not perfectly pleaſed, but bore them rather in compliance to the will of her aunt, than from real inclination. I had even the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to ſee her laviſh ſome kind looks upon my unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate ſon, which the other could neither extort by his fortune nor aſſiduity. Mr. Thornhill's ſeeming compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, however, not a little ſurpriſed me: we had now continued here a week, at the preſſing inſtances of Mr. Arnold; but each day the more tenderneſs Miſs Wilmot ſhewed my ſon, Mr. Thornhill's friendſhip ſeemed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably to encreaſe for him.</p>
                     <p>He had formerly made us the moſt kind aſſurances of uſing his intereſt to ſerve the family; but now his generoſity was not confined to promiſes alone: the morning I deſigned for my departure, Mr. Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill came to me with looks of real pleaſure to inform me of a piece of ſervice he had done for his friend George. This was nothing leſs than his having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured him an enſign's commiſſion in one of the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that was going to the Weſt-Indies, for which he had promiſed but one hundred pounds, his intereſt having been ſufficient to get an abatement of the other two. "As for this trifling piece of ſervice," continued the young gentleman,
<q>I deſire no other reward but the pleaſure of having ſerved my friend; and as for the hundred pound to be paid, if you are unable to raiſe it yourſelves, I will advance it, and you ſhall repay me at your leiſure.</q> This was a favour we wanted words to expreſs our ſenſe of: I readily therefore gave my bond for the money, and teſtified as much gratitude as if I never intended to pay.</p>
                     <p>George was to depart for town the next day to ſecure his commiſſion, in purſuance of his generous pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron's directions, who judged it highly expedient to uſe diſpatch, leſt in the mean time another ſhould ſtep in with more advantageous propoſals. The next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, therefore, our young ſoldier was early prepared for his departure, and ſeemed the only perſon among us that was not affected by it. Neither the fatigues and dangers he was going to encounter, nor the friends and
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:012405_0108_0F897326D77589F8"/>
miſtreſs, for Miſs Wilmot actually loved him, he was leaving behind, any way damped his ſpirits. After he had taken leave, of the reſt of the company, I gave him all I had, my bleſſing. "And now, my boy," cried I,
<q>thou art going to fight for thy country, remember how thy brave grandfather fought for his ſacred king, when loyalty among Britons was a virtue. Go, my boy, and imitate him in all but his misfortunes, if it was a misfortune to die with Lorld Falkland. Go, my boy, and if you fall, tho' diſtant, expoſed and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wept by thoſe that love you, the moſt precious tears are thoſe with which heaven bedews the unburied head of a ſoldier.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The next morning I took leave of the good fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, that had been kind enough to entertain me ſo long, not without ſeveral expreſſions of gratitude to Mr. Thornhill for his late bounty. I left them in the enjoyment of all that happineſs which affluence and good breeding procure, and returned towards home, deſpairing of ever finding my daughter more, but ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſigh to heaven to ſpare and to forgive her. I was now come within about twenty miles of home, having hired an horſe to carry me, as I was yet but weak, and comforted myſelf with the hopes of ſoon ſeeing all I held deareſt upon earth. But the night coming on, I put up at a little public houſe by the road-ſide, and aſked for the landlord's company over a pint of wine. We ſat beſide his kitchen fire, which was the beſt room in the houſe, and chatted on politics and the news of the country. We happened, among other topics, to talk of young 'Squire Thornhill, whom the hoſt aſſured me was hated as much as an uncle of his, who ſometimes came down to the country, was loved. He went on to obſerve, that he made it his whole ſtudy to betray the daughters of ſuch as received him to their houſes, and after a fortnight or three weeks poſſeſſion, he turned them out unregarded and abandoned to the world. As we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued our diſcourſe in this manner, his wife, who had been out to get change, returned, and perceiving that her huſband was enjoying a pleaſure in which ſhe was not a ſharer, ſhe aſked him, in an angry tone, what
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:012405_0109_0F89732733F9A618"/>
he did there, to which he only replied in an ironical way by drinking her health. "Mr. Symmonds," cried ſhe,
<q>you uſe me very ill, and I'll bear it no longer. Here three parts of the buſineſs is left for me to do, and the fourth left unfiniſhed; while you do nothing but ſoak with the gueſts all day long, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if a ſpoonful of liquor were to cure me of a fever, I never touch a drop.</q> I now found what ſhe would be at, and immediately poured her out a glaſs, which ſhe received with a curteſy, and drinking towards my good health, "Sir," reſumed ſhe,

There now above ſtairs, we have a young woman who has come to take up her lodgings here, and I don't believe ſhe has got any money by her over civility.

What! you trumpery, to come and take up an honeſt houſe, without croſs or coin to bleſs yourſelf with; come along, I ſay."—"O dear madam," cried the ſtranger, "pity me, a poor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned creature for one night, and death will ſoon do the reſt."—I inſtantly knew the voice of my poor ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed child Olivia. I flew to her reſcue, while the woman was dragging her along by the hair, and caught the dear forlorn wretch in my arms.—"Welcome, any way welcome, my deareſt loſt one, my treaſure, to your poor old father's boſom. Tho' the vicious forſake thee, there is yet one in the world that will never forſake thee; tho' thou hadſt ten thouſand crimes to anſwer for, he will forget them all."—"O my own dear"—for minutes ſhe could no more—"my own deareſt good papa! Could angels be kinder! How do I deſerve ſo much! The villain, I hate him and myſelf, to be a reproach to ſuch goodneſs. You can't forgive me, I know you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not."—"Yes, my child, from my heart I do forgive thee! Only repent, and we both ſhall yet be happy. We ſhall ſee many pleaſant days yet, my Olivia!"—"Ah! never, ſir, never. The reſt of my wretched life muſt be infamy abroad and ſhame at home. But, alas! papa, you look much paler than you uſed to do. Could ſuch a thing as I am give you ſo much uneaſineſs? Sure you have too much wiſdom to taſte the miſeries of my guilt upon yourſelf."—"Our wiſdom, young woman," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied I.—"Ah, why ſo cold a name, papa<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>" cried ſhe. "This is the firſt time you ever called me by ſo cold a name"—I aſk pardon, my darling," returned I; "but I was going to obſerve, that wiſdom makes but a ſlow defence againſt trouble, though at laſt a ſure one."</p>
                     <p>The landlady now returned to know if we did not chuſe a more genteel apartment, to which aſſenting, we were ſhewn a room, where we could converſe more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. After we had talked ourſelves into ſome degree of tranquillity, I could not avoid deſiring ſome account of the gradations that led to her preſent wretched ſituation. "That villain, ſir," ſaid ſhe, "from the firſt day of our meeting made me honourable, though private, propro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals."</p>

                     <p>"My dear papa," returned my daughter, "you la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour under a ſtrange miſtake, Mr. Burchell never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to deceive me. Inſtead of that he took every opportunity of privately admoniſhing me againſt the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices of Mr. Thornhill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who now I find was even worſe than he repreſented him."—"Mr. Thornhill," inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted I, "can it be?"—"Yes, Sir," returned ſhe, "it was Mr. Thornhill who ſeduced me, who employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the two ladies, as he called them, but who, in fact, were abandoned women of the town, without breeding or pity, to decoy us up to London. Their artifices, you may remember, would have certainly ſucceeded, but for Mr. Burchell's letter, who directed thoſe reproaches at them, which we all applied to ourſelves. How he came to have ſo much influence as to defeat their intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſtill remains a ſecret to me; but I am convinced he was ever our warmeſt, ſincereſt friend."</p>
                     <p>"You amaze me, my dear," cried I; "but now I find my firſt ſuſpicions of Mr. Thornhill's baſeneſs were too well grounded: but he can triumph in ſecurity; for he is rich and we are poor. But tell me, my child, ſure it was no ſmall temptation that could thus obliterate all the impreſſions of ſuch an education, and ſo virtuous a diſpoſition as thine."</p>
                     <p>"Indeed, Sir," replied ſhe, "he owes all his triumph to the deſire I had of making him, and not myſelf, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. I knew that the ceremony of our marriage, which was privately performed by a popiſh prieſt, was no way binding, and that I had nothing to truſt to but his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour." "What," interrupted I, "and were you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed married by a prieſt, and in orders."—"Indeed. Sir, we were," replied ſhe, "though we were both ſworn to conceal his name."—"Why then, my child, come to my arms again, and now you are a thouſand times more welcome than before: for you are now his wife to all intents and purpoſes: nor can all the laws of man, tho' written upon tables of adamant, leſſen the force of that ſacred connexion."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="114" facs="unknown:012405_0112_0F89732972D85798"/>"Alas, papa," replied ſhe, "you are but little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his villainies: he has been married alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, by the ſame prieſt, to ſix or eight wives more, whom, like me, he has deceived and abandoned."</p>
                     <p>"Has he ſo?" cried I, "then we muſt hang the prieſt, and you ſhall inform againſt him to morrow."— "But, Sir," returned ſhe, "will that be right, when I am ſworn to ſecrecy?"—"My dear," I replied, "if you have made ſuch a promiſe, I cannot, nor will not, tempt you to break it. Even tho' it may benefit the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, you muſt not inform againſt him. In all human in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions a ſmaller evil is allowed to procure a greater good; as in politics, a province may be given away to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a kingdom; in medicine, a limb may be lopt off, to preſerve the body. But in religion the law is written, and inflexible, <hi>never</hi> to do evil. And this law, my child, is right: for otherwiſe, if we commit a ſmaller evil, to procure a greater good, certain guilt would be thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred, in expectation of contingent advantage. And though the advantage ſhould certainly follow, yet the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval between commiſſion and advantage, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be guilty, may be that in which we are called away to anſwer for the things we have done, and the volume of human actions is cloſed for ever. But I inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt you, my dear, go on."</p>
                     <p>"The very next morning," continued ſhe, "I found what little expectations I was to have from his ſincerity. That very morning he introduced me to two unhappy women more, whom, like me, he had deceived, but who lived in contented proſtitution. I loved him too tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to bear ſuch rivals in his affections, and ſtrove to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get my infamy in a tumult of pleaſures. With this view, I danced, dreſſed, and talked; but ſtill was unhappy. The gentlemen who viſited there, told me every moment of the power of my charms, and this only contributed to encreaſe my melancholy, as I had thrown all their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er quite away. Thus each day I grew more penſive, and he more inſolent, till at laſt the monſter had the aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to offer me to a young Baronet of his acquaintance. Need I deſcribe, Sir, how his ingratitude ſtung me? My anſwer to this propoſal was almoſt madneſs. I deſired to part. As I was going he offered me a purſe; but I flung

it at him with indignation, and burſt from him in a rage, that for a while kept me inſenſible of the miſeries of my ſituation. But I ſoon looked round me, and ſaw myſelf a vile, abject, guilty thing, without one friend in the world to apply to.</p>
                     <p>"Juſt in that interval, a ſtage-coach happening to paſs by, I took a place, it being my only aim to be driven at a diſtance from a wretch I deſpiſed and deteſted. I was ſet down here, where, ſince my arrival, my own anxiety, and this woman's unkindneſs, have been my on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly companions. The hours of pleaſure that I have paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with my mamma and ſiſter, now grow painful to me. Their ſorrows are much; but mine are greater than theirs; for mine are guilt and infamy."</p>
                     <p>"Have patience, my child," cried I, "and I hope things will yet be better. Take ſome repoſe to-night, and to-morrow I'll carry you home to your mother, and the reſt of the family, from whom you will receive a kind reception. Poor woman, this has gone to her heart: but ſhe loves you ſtill, Olivia, and will forget it."</p>

                     <head>CHAP. III. Offences are eaſily pardoned where there is love at bottom.</head>
                     <p>THE next morning I took my daughter behind me, and ſet out on my return home. As we travelled along, I ſtrove by every perſuaſion, to calm her ſorrows and fears, and to arm her with reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to bear the preſence of her offended mother. I took every opportunity, from the proſpect of a fine country, through which we paſſed to obſerve how much kinder Heaven was to us, than we were to each other, and that the misfortunes of nature's making were very few. I aſſured her, that ſhe ſhould never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any change in my affections, and that during my life, which yet might be long, ſhe might depend upon a guardian and an inſtructor. I armed her againſt the cenſures of the world, ſhewed her, that books were ſweet unreproaching companions to the miſerable, and that if they could not bring us to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy life, they would teach us to endure it.</p>
                     <p>The hired horſe that we rode was to be put up that night at an inn by the way, within about five miles from my houſe, and as I was willing to prepare my family for my daughter's reception, I determined to leave her that night at the inn, and to come for her, acompanied by my daughter Sophia, early the next morning. It was night before we reached our appointed ſtage: however, after ſeeing her provided with a decent apartment, and having ordered the hoſteſs to prepare proper refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I kiſſed her, and proceeded towards home. My heart caught new ſenſations of pleaſure the nearer I approached that peaceful manſion. As a bird that has been frighted from its neſt, my affections out-went my haſte, and hovered round my little fire-ſide, with all the rapture of expectation. I called up the many
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:012405_0115_0F89732BB4E784A0"/>
fond things I had to ſay, and anticipated the welcome I was to receive. I already felt my wife's tender em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, and ſmiled at the joy of my little ones. As I walked but ſlowly, the night waned apace. The labourers of the day were all retired to reſt; the lights were out in every cottage; no ſounds were heard but of the ſhrilling cock, and the deep-mouthed watch-dog, at hollow diſtance. I approached my little abode of pleaſure, and before I was within a furlong of the place, our honeſt maſtiff came running to welcome me.</p>
                     <p>It was now near mid-night that I came to knock at my door: all was ſtill and ſilent: my heart dilated with unutterable happineſs, when, to my amazement, the houſe was burſting out in a blaze of fire, and every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>perture was red with conflagration! I gave a loud con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive outcry, and fell upon the pavement inſenſible. This alarmed my ſon, who perceiving the flames, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly waked my wife and daughter, and all running, out naked, and wild with apprehenſion, recalled me to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ife with their anguiſh. But it was only to objects of new terror; for the flames had, by this time, caught the roof of our dwelling, part after part continuing to fall in, while the family ſtood, with ſilent agony, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on, as if they enjoyed the blaze. I gazed upon them and upon it by turns, and then looked round me for my two little ones; but they were not to be ſeen. O miſery! "Where," cried I,
<q>where are my little ones?</q> —"They are burnt to death in the flames," ſays my wife calmly, "and I will die with them."— That moment I heard the cry of the babes within, who were juſt awaked by the fire, and nothing could have ſtopped me. "Where, where, are my children?" cried I, ruſhing through the flames, and burſting the door of the chamber in which they were confined, "Where are my little ones?"— <q>Here, dear-papa, here we are,</q> cried they together, while the flames were juſt catching the bed where they lay. I caught them both in my arms and ſnatched them through the fire as faſt as poſſible, while juſt as I got out, the roof ſunk in. "Now," cried I, holding up my children,
<q>now let the flames burn on, and all my poſſeſſions

periſh. Here they are, I have ſaved my treaſure. Here, my deareſt, here are our treaſures, and we ſhall yet be happy.</q> We kiſſed our little darlings a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times, they claſped us round the neck, and ſeemed to ſhare our tranſports, while their mother laughed and wept by turns.</p>
                     <p>I now ſtood a calm ſpectator of the flames, and, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome time began to perceive that my arm to the ſhoulder was ſcorched in a terrible manner. It was therefore out of my power to give my ſon any aſſiſtance, either in attempting to ſave our goods, or preventing the flames ſpreading to our corn. By this time, the neighbours were alarmed, and came running to our aſſiſtance; but all they could do was to ſtand, like us, ſpectators of the calamity. My goods, among which were the notes I had reſerved for my daughters for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, were entirely conſumed, except a box, with ſome papers, that ſtood in the kitchen, and two or three things more of little conſequence, which my ſon brought away in the beginning. The neighbours contributed, however what they could to lighten our diſtreſs. They brought us cloaths, and furniſhed one of our out-houſes with kitchen utenſils; ſo that by day-light we had another, tho' a wretched dwelling to retire to. My honeſt next neighbour, and his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were not the leaſt aſſiduous in providing us with every thing neceſſary, and offering whatever conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on untuto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>When the fears of my family had ſubſided, curioſity to know the cauſe of my long ſtay began to take place; having therefore informed them of every particular, I proceeded to prepare them for the reception of our loſt one; and tho' we had nothing but wretchedneſs now to impart, yet to procure her a welcome to what we had. This taſk would have been more difficult but for o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

reconciliation; for women have a much ſtronger ſenſe of female error than men. "Ah, madam," cried her mother,
<q>this is but a poor place you are come to after ſo much finery. My daughter Sophy and I can afford but little entertainment to perſons who have kept company only with people of diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Yes, Miſs Livy, your poor father and I have ſuffered very much of late; but I hope heaven will forgive you.</q> —During this reception, the unhappy victim ſtood pale and trembling, unable to weep or to reply; but I could not continue a ſilent ſpectator of her diſtreſs: wherefore aſſuming a degree of ſeverity in my voice and manner, which was ever followed with inſtant ſubmiſſion,
<q>I entreat, woman, that my words may be now marked once for all: I have here brought you back a poor deluded wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer; her return to duty demands the revival of our tenderneſs. The real hardſhips of life are now coming faſt upon us, let us not therefore encreaſe them by diſſention among each other. If we live harmoniouſly together, we may yet be contented, as there are enough of us here to ſhut out the cenſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing world, and keep each other in countenance. The kindneſs of heaven is promiſed to the penitent, and let ours be directed by the example. Heaven, we are aſſured, is much more pleaſed to view a repentant ſinner, than many perſons who have ſupported a courſe of undeviating rectitude. And this is right; for that ſingle effort by which we ſtop ſhort in the down-hill path to perdition, is itſelf a greater exertion of virtue, than an hundred acts of juſtice.</q>

Being diſabled myſelf from aſſiſting my ſon in our uſual occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations, I read to my family from the few books that were ſaved, and particularly from ſuch, as, by amuſing the imagination, contributed to eaſe the heart. Our good neighbours too came every day with the kindeſt condolence, and fixed a time in which they were all to aſſiſt at repairing my former dwelling. Honeſt farmer Williams was not laſt among theſe viſitors; but hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily offered his friendſhip. He would even have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed his addreſſes to my daughter; but ſhe rejected them in ſuch a manner as totally repreſſed his future ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitations. Her grief ſeemed formed for continuing, and ſhe was the only perſon of our little ſociety that a week did not reſtore to chearfulneſs. She now loſt that unbluſhing innocence which once taught her to reſpect herſelf, and to ſeek pleaſure by pleaſing. Anxiety now had taken ſtrong poſſeſſion of her mind, her beauty began to be impared with her conſtitution, and neglect ſtill more contributed to diminiſh it. Every tender epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thet, beſtowed on her ſiſter brought a pang to her heart and a tear to her eye; and as one vice, tho' cured, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ever plants others where it has been, ſo her former guilt, tho' driven out by repentance, left jealouſy and envy behind.

                        <q>Matilda was married very young to a Neapolitan nobleman of the firſt quality, and found herſelf a widow and a mother at the age of fifteen. As ſhe ſtood one day careſſing her infant ſon in the open window of an apartment, which hung over the river Volturna, the child, with a ſudden ſpring leaped from her arms into the flood below, and diſappeared in a moment. The mother, ſtruck with inſtant ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, and making an effort to ſave him, plunged in after; but, far from being able to aſſiſt the infant, ſhe herſelf with great difficulty eſcaped to the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite ſhore, juſt when ſome French ſoldiers were plundering the country on that ſide, who immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made her their priſoner.</q>

This baſe reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, however, was oppoſed by a young officer, who, tho' their retreat required the utmoſt expedition, placed her behind him, and brought her in ſafety to his native city. Her beauty at firſt caught his eye, her merit ſoon after his heart. They were married; he roſe to the higheſt poſts; they lived long together, and were happy. But the ſelicity of a ſoldier can never be called permanent: after an interval of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral years the troops, which he commanded having met with a repulſe, he was obliged to take ſhelter in the city where he had lived with his wife. Here they ſuffered a ſiege, and the city at length was taken. Few hiſtories can produce more various inſtances of cruelty, than thoſe which the French and Italians at
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:012405_0120_0F8973303335CD60"/>
that time exerciſed upon each other. It was reſolved by the victors, upon this occaſion, to put all the French priſoners to death; but particularly the huſband of the unfortunate Matilda, as he was prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally inſtrumental in protracting the ſiege. Their determinations were, in general executed almoſt as ſoon as reſolved upon. The captive ſoldier was led forth, and the executioner, with his ſword, ſtood ready, while the ſpectators in gloomy ſilence awaited the fatal blow, which was only ſuſpended till the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, who preſided as judge, ſhould give the ſignal. It was in this interval of anguiſh and expectation, that Matilda came to take her laſt farewell of her huſband and deliverer, deploring her wretched ſituation and the cruelty of fate, that had ſaved her from periſhing by a premature death in the river Volturna, to be the ſpectator of ſtill greater calamities. The general, who was a young man, was ſtruck with ſurprize at her beauty, and pity at her diſtreſs; but with ſtill ſtronger emotions when he heard her mention her former dangers. He was her ſon, the infant for whom ſhe had encountred ſo much danger. He acknowledged her at once as his mother and fell at her feet. The reſt may be eaſily ſuppoſed: the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive was ſet free, and all the happineſs that love, friendſhip, and duty could confer on each, were united.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this manner I would attempt to amuſe my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but ſhe liſtened with divided attention; for her own misfortunes engroſſed all the pity ſhe once had for thoſe of another, and nothing gave her eaſe. In com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſhe dreaded contempt: and in ſolitude ſhe only found anxiety. Such was the colour of her wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, when we received certain information, that Mr. Thornhill was going to be married to Miſs Wilmot, for whom I always ſuſpected he had a real paſſion, tho' he took every opportunity before me to expreſs his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt both of her perſon and fortune. This news only ſerved to encreaſe poor Olivia's affliction; ſuch a fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant breach of fidelity, was more than her courage could
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:012405_0121_0F897330F2ED27B8"/>
ſupport. I was reſolved, however, to get more certain information, and to defeat, if poſſible, the completion of his deſigns, by ſending my ſon to old Mr. Wilmot's, with inſtructions to know the truth of the report, and to deliver Miſs Wilmot a letter, intimating Mr. Thornhill's conduct in my family. My ſon went, in purſuance of my directions, and in three days returned, aſſuring us of the truth of the account; but that he had found it impoſſible to deliver the letter, which he was therefore obliged to leave, as Mr. Thornhill and Miſs Wilmot were viſiting round the country. They were to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, he ſaid, in a few days, having appeared together at church the Sunday before he was there, in great ſplendour, the bride attended by ſix young ladies dreſſed in white, and he by as many gentlemen. Their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching nuptials filled the whole country with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing, and they uſually rode out together in the grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt equipage that had been ſeen in the country for many years. All the friends of both families, he ſaid, were there, particularly the 'Squire's uncle, Sir William Thornhill, who bore ſo good a character. He added, that nothing but mirth and feaſting were going for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; that all the country praiſed the young bride's beauty and the bridegroom's fine perſon, and that they were immenſely fond of each other; concluding, that he could not help thinking Mr. Thornhill one of the moſt happy men in the world.</p>
                     <p>"Why let him if he can," returned I:
<q>but, my ſon, obſerve this bed of ſtraw, and unſheltering roof; thoſe mouldering walls, and humid floor; my wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed body thus diſabled by fire, and my children weeping round me for bread; you have come home, my child, to all this, yet here, even here you ſee a man that would not for a thouſand worlds ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change ſituations. O, my children, if you could but learn to commune with your own hearts, and know what noble company you can make them, you would little regard the elegance and ſplendours of the worthleſs. Almoſt all men have been taught to call life a paſſage and themſelves the travellers. The ſimilitude ſtill may be improved when we obſerve that

A ſupply of proviſions, charitably ſent us by my kind pariſhioners, ſeemed to diffuſe chearfulneſs amongſt the reſt of the family, nor was I diſpleaſed at ſeeing them once more ſprightly and at eaſe. It would have been unjuſt to damp their ſatisfactions, merely to condole with reſolute melancholy, or to burthen them with a ſadneſs they did not feel.

Sir, "replied I,

                     </p>
                     <p>"I vow, my dear ſir," returned he,
<q>I am amazed at all this; nor can I underſtand what it means! I hope you don't think your daughter's late excurſion with me had any thing criminal in it.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>"Go," cried I,
<q>thou art a wretch, a poor pitiful wretch, and every way a liar; but your meanneſs ſecures you from my anger! Yet, ſir, I am deſcended from a family that would not have borne this! And ſo, thou vile thing, to gratify a momentary paſſion, thou haſt made one poor creature wretched for life, and polluted a family that had nothing but honour for their portion.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>"If ſhe or you," returned he, <q>are reſolved to be miſerable, I cannot help it. But you may ſtill be happy; and whatever opinion you may have formed of me, you ſhall ever find me ready to contribute to it. We can readily marry her to another, and what is more, ſhe may keep her lover beſide; for I proteſt I ſhall ever continue to have a true regard for her.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>I found all my paſſions awakened at this new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grading propoſal; for though the mind may often be calm under great injuries, little villainy can at any time get within the ſoul, and ſting it into rage.— <q>Avoid my ſight, thou reptile,</q> cried I,
<q>nor continue to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult me with thy preſence. Were my brave ſon at

                     </p>
                     <p>"I find," cried he,
<q>you are bent upon obliging me to talk in an harſher manner than I intended. But as I have ſhewn you what may be hoped from my friendſhip, it may not be improper to repreſent what may be the conſquences of my reſentment. My attorney, to whom your late bond has been tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, threatens hard, nor do I know how to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the courſe of juſtice, except by paying the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney myſelf, which, as I have been at ſome expences lately, previous to my intended marriage, it is not ſo eaſy to be done. And then my ſteward talks of driving for the rent: it is certain he knows his duty; for I never trouble myſelf with affairs of that nature. Yet ſtill I could wiſh to ſerve you, and even to have you and your daughter preſent at my marriage, which is ſhortly to be ſolemnized with Miſs Wilmot: it is even the requeſt of my charming Arabella her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, whom I hope you will not refuſe.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>"Mr. Thornhill," replied I,
<q>hear me once for all: as to your marriage with any but my daughter, that I never will conſent to; or though your friendſhip could raiſe me to a throne, and your reſentment ſink me to the grave, yet would I deſpiſe both. Thou haſt once wofully, irreparably deceived me. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed my heart upon thine honour, and have found it's baſeneſs. Never more, therefore, expect friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip from me. Go and poſſeſs what fortune has given thee, beauty, riches, health, and pleaſure. Go, and leave me to want, infamy, diſeaſe, and ſorrow. Yet humbled as I am, ſhall my heart ſtill vindicate its dignity, and though thou haſt my forgiveneſs, thou ſhalt ever have my contempt.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>"If ſo," returned he,
<q>depend upon it you ſhall feel the effects of this inſolence, and we ſhall ſhortly ſee which is the fitteſt object of ſcorn, you or I.</q> — Upon which he departed abruptly.</p>
                     <p>My wife and ſon, who were preſent at this interview, ſeemed terrified with the apprehenſion. My daughters alſo finding that he was gone, came out to be informed
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:012405_0126_0F8973358459A1D8"/>
of the reſult of our conference, which, when known, alarmed them not leſs than the reſt. But as to myſelf I diſregarded the utmoſt ſtretch of his malevolence: he had already ſtruck the blow, and now I ſtood pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to repel every new effort. Like one of thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments uſed in the art of war, which, however, thrown, ſtill preſents a point to receive the enemy.</p>
                     <p>We ſoon, however found that he had not threatened in vain; for the very next day his ſteward came to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand my annual rent, which, by the train of accidents already related, I was unable to pay. The conſequence of my incapacity was his driving my cattle that evening, and their being appraiſed and ſold the next day for leſs than half their value. My wife and children now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore entreated me to comply upon any terms, rather than incur certain deſtruction. They even begged of me to admit his viſits once more, and uſed all their little eloquence to paint the calamities I was going to endure: the terrors of a priſon, in ſo rigorous a ſeaſon as the preſent, with the danger that threatened my health from the late accident that happened by the fire. But I continued inflexible.</p>
                     <p>"Why, my treaſures," cried I,
<q>why will you thus attempt to perſuade me to the thing that is not right! My duty has taught me to forgive him; but my conſcience will not permit me to approve. Would you have me applaud to the world what my heart muſt internally condemn? Would you have me tamely ſit down and flatter our infamous betrayer; and to avoid a priſon continually ſuffer the more galling bonds of mental confinement! No, never. If we are to be taken from this abode, only let us hold to the right, and wherever we are thrown, we can ſtill retire to a charming apartment, and look round our own hearts with intrepidity and with pleaſure!</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this manner we ſpent that evening. Early the next morning, as the ſnow had fallen in great ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance in the night, my ſon was employed in clearing it away, and opening a paſſage before the door. He had not been thus engaged long, when he came running in,
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:012405_0127_0F897336839148C8"/>
with looks all pale, to tell us that two ſtrangers, whom he knew to be officers of juſtice, were making towards the houſe.</p>
                     <p>Juſt as he ſpoke, they came in, and approaching the bed where I lay, after previouſly informing me of their employment and buſineſs, made me their priſoner, bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding me prepare to go with them to the county goal, which was eleven miles off.</p>
                     <p>"My friends," ſaid I,
<q>this is ſevere weather on which you have come to take me to a priſon; and it is particularly unfortunate at this time, as one of my arms has lately been burnt in a terrible manner, and it has thrown me into a ſlight fever, and I want cloaths to cover me, and I am now too weak and old to walk far in ſuch deep ſnow: but if it muſt be ſo, I'll try to obey you.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>I then turned to my wife and children, and directed them to get together what few things were left us, and to prepare immediately for leaving this place. I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated them to be expeditious and deſired my ſon to aſſiſt his elder ſiſter, who, from a conſciouſneſs that ſhe was the cauſe of all our calamities, was fallen, and had loſt anguiſh in inſenſibility. I encouraged my wife, who, pale and trembling, claſped our affrighted little ones in her arms, that clung to her boſom in ſilence, dreading to look round at the ſtrangers. In the mean time my young<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eſt daughter prepared for our departure, and as ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceived ſeveral hints to uſe diſpatch, in about an hour we were ready to depart.</p>

                     <p>WE ſet forward from this peaceful neighbourhood, and walked on ſlowly. My eldeſt daughter being enfeebled by a ſlow fever, which had begun for ſome days to undermine her conſtitution, one of the officers, who had an horſe, kindly took her behind him; for even theſe men cannot entirely diveſt themſelves of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. My ſon led one of the little ones by the hand, and my wife the other, while I leaned upon my youngeſt girl, whoſe tears fell not for her own but my diſtreſſes.</p>
                     <p>We were now got from my late dwelling about two miles, when we ſaw a crowd running and ſhouting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind us, conſiſting of about fifty of my pooreſt pariſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Theſe, with dreadful imprecations ſoon ſeized upon the two officers of juſtice, and ſwearing they would never ſee their miniſter go to gaol while they had a drop of blood to ſhed in his defence, were going to uſe them with great ſeverity. The conſequence might have been fatal, had I not immediately inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and with ſome difficulty reſcued the officers from the hands of the enraged multitude. My children who looked upon my delivery now as certain, appeared tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with joy, and were incapable of containing their raptures. But they were ſoon undeceived, upon hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me addreſs the poor deluded people, who came, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

As ſure as he lives he ſhall feel my reſentment. Alas! my dear deluded flock, return back to the duty you owe to God, to your country and to me. I ſhall yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps one day ſee you in greater felicity here, and contribute to make your lives more happy. But let it at leaſt be my comfort when I pen my fold for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, that not one here ſhall be wanting.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>They now ſeemed all repentance, and melting into tears, came one after the other to bid me farewell. I ſhook each tenderly by the hand, and leaving them my bleſſing, proceeded forward without meeting any farther interruption. Some hours before night we reached the town, or rather village; for it conſiſted but of a few mean houſes, having loſt all its former opulence, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining no marks of its ancient ſuperiority but the gaol.</p>
                     <p>Upon entering, we put up at an inn, where we had ſuch refreſhments as could moſt readily be procured, and I ſupped with my family with my uſual chearfulneſs. After ſeeing them properly accomodated for that night, I next attended the ſheriff's officers to the priſon, which had formerly been built for the purpoſes of war, and conſiſted of one large apartment, ſtrongly grated, and paved with ſtone, common to both felons and debtors at certain hours in the four and twenty. Beſides this, every priſoner had a ſeparate cell, where he was locked in for the night.</p>
                     <p>I expected upon my enterance to find nothing but lamentations, and various ſounds of miſery; but it was very different. The priſoners ſeemed all employed in one common deſign, that of forgetting thought in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment or clamour. I was apprized of the uſual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite required upon theſe occaſions, and immediately complied with the demand, though the little money I had was very near being all exhauſted.

                     <p>With ſuch reflections I laboured to become chearful; but chearfulneſs was never yet produced by effort, which is itſelf painful. As I was ſitting therefore in a corner of the gaol, in a penſive poſture, one of my fellow priſoners came up, and ſitting by me, entered into converſation. It was my conſtant rule in life never to avoid the converſation of any man who ſeemed to deſire it: for if good, I might profit by his inſtruction: if bad, he might be aſſiſted by mine. I found this to be a knowing man, of ſtrong unlettered ſenſe; but a thorough knowledge of the world, as it is called, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Have I not had the pleaſure of once ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you at Welbridge fair, and is not your name Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im Jenkinſon?" At this demand he only ſighed. "I ſuppoſe you muſt recollect," reſumed I, "one Doctor Primroſe, from whom you bought a horſe."</p>
                     <p>He now at once recollected me; for the gloomineſs of the place and the approaching night had prevented his diſtinguiſhing my features before.—"Yes, Sir," returned Mr. Jenkinſon, "I remember you perfectly well, I bought an horſe, but forgot to pay for him. Your neighbour Flamborough is the only proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor I am any way afraid of at the next aſſizes: for he intends to ſwear poſitively againſt me as a coiner.

                     <p>"Well, ſir," cried he, "all the return I can make ſhall be yours. You ſhall have more than half my bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloaths to night, and I'll take care to ſtand your friend in the priſon, where I think I have ſome influence."</p>
                     <p>I thanked him, and could not avoid being ſurpriſed at the preſent youthful change in his aſpect, for at the time I had ſeen him before, he appeared at leaſt ſixty. —'Sir," anſwered he, "you are little acquainted with the world; I had at that time falſe hair, and have learnt the art of counterfeiting every age from ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen to ſeventy. Ah ſir, had I but beſtowed half the pains in learning a trade, that I have in learning to be a ſcoundrel, I might have been a rich man at this day.

                     <head>CHAP. VII. A reformation in the gaol. To make laws complete they ſhould reward as well as puniſh.</head>
                     <p>THE next morning early I was awakened by my family, whom I found in tears at my bed-ſide. The gloomy-ſtrength of every thing about us, it ſeems, had daunted them. I gently rebuked their ſorrow, aſſuring them I had never ſlept with greater tranquillity, and next enquired after my eldeſt daughter, who was not among them. They informed me that yeſterday's uneaſineſs and fatigue had encreaſed her fever, and it was judged proper to leave her behind. My next care was to ſend my ſon to procure a room or two to lodge the family in, as near the priſon as conveniently could be found. He obeyed; but could only find one apartment, which was hired at a ſmall expence, for his mother and ſiſters, the gaoler with humanity conſenting to let him and his two little brothers lie in the priſon with me. A bed was therefore prepared for them in a corner of the room, which I thought anſwered very conveniently. I was willing however previouſly to know whether my little children choſe to lie in a place which ſeemed to fright them upon entrance.</p>
                     <p>"Well," cried I, "my good boys, how do you like your bed? I hope you are not afraid to lie in this room, dark as it appears."</p>
                     <p>"No, papa" ſays Dick, "I am not afraid to lie any where, where you are."</p>
                     <p>"And I," ſays Bill, who was yet but four years old, "love every place beſt that my papa is in."</p>
                     <p>After this, I allotted to each of the family what they were to do. My daughter was particularly directed to watch her declining ſiſter's health; my wife was to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:012405_0134_0F89733C48D7BBA0"/>
me; my little boys were to read to me: "And as for you, my ſon," continued I, "it is by the labour of your hands we muſt all hope to be ſupported. Your wages, as a day labourer, will be full ſufficient, with proper frugality, to maintain us all, and comfortably too. Thou art now ſixteen years old, and haſt ſtrength, and it was given to thee, my ſon, for very uſeful purpoſes; for it muſt ſave from famine your helpleſs parents and family. Prepare then this evening to look out for work againſt to-morrow, and bring home every night what money you earn, for our ſupport."</p>
                     <p>Having thus inſtructed him, and ſettled the reſt, I walked down to the common priſon, where I could enjoy more air and room. But I was not long there when the execrations, lewdneſs, and brutality that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded me on every ſide, drove me back to my apartment again. Here I ſat for ſome time, pondering upon the ſtrange infatuation of wretches, who finding all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in open arms againſt them, were, however labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make themſelves a future and a tremendous ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
                     <p>Their inſenſibility excited my higheſt compaſſion, and blotted my own uneaſineſs a while from my mind. It even appeared as a duty incumbent upon me to attempt to reclaim them. I reſolved therefore once more to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and in ſpite of their contempt to give them my advice, and conquer them by perſeverance. Going therefore among them again, I informed Mr. Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinſon of my deſign, at which he laughed, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated it to the reſt. The propoſal was received with the greateſt good humour, as it promiſed to afford a new fund of entertainment to perſons who had now no other reſource for mirth, but what could be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from ridicule or debauchery.</p>
                     <p>I therefore read them a portion of the ſervice with a loud unaffected voice, and found my audience per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly merry upon the occaſion. Lewd whiſpers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> groans of contrition burleſqued, winking and cough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, alternately excited laughter. However, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued with my natural ſolemnity to read on, ſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that what I did might amend ſome, but could it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>
                        <pb n="137" facs="unknown:012405_0135_0F89733CF1D86BF8"/>After reading, I entered upon my exhortation, which was rather calculated at firſt to amuſe them than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove. I previouſly obſerved, that no other motive but their welfare could induce me to this; that I was their fellow priſoner, and now gained nothing by preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I was ſorry, I ſaid, to hear them ſo very prophane; becauſe they got nothing by it, but might loſe a great deal: "For be aſſured, my friends," cried I, for you are my friends, however the world may diſclaim your friendſhip, though you ſwore twelve thouſand oaths in a day, it would not put one penny in your purſe. Then what ſignifies calling every moment upon the devil, and courting his friendſhip, ſince you find how ſcurvily he uſes you? He has given you nothing here, you find, but a mouthful of oaths and an empty belly; and by the beſt accounts I have of him, he will give you nothing that's good hereafter.</p>
                     <p>"If uſed ill in our dealings with one man, we natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally go elſewhere. Were it not worth your while then, juſt to try how you may like the uſage of another maſter, who gives you fair promiſes at leaſt to come to him? Surely, my friends, of all ſtupidity in the world, his muſt be greateſt, who after robbing an houſe, runs to the thief-takers for protection. And yet how are you more wiſe? You are all ſeeking comfort from him that has already betrayed you, applying to a more malicious being than any thief-taker of them all; for they only decoy, and then hang you but he decoys, and hangs, and, what is worſt of all, will not let you looſe after the hangman has done."</p>
                     <p>When I had concluded, I received the compliments of my audience, ſome of whom came and ſhook me by the hand, ſwearing that I was a very honeſt fellow, and that they deſired my further acquaintance. I therefore promiſed to repeat my lecture next day, and actually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſome hopes of making a reformation here; for it had ever been my opinion, that no man was paſt the hour of amendment, every heart lying open to the ſhafts of reproof, if the archer could but take a proper aim. When I had thus ſatisfied my mind, I went back to my apartment, where my wife had prepared a frugal meal, while Mr. Jenkinſon begged leave to add his dinner to
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:012405_0136_0F89733DB35ED160"/>
ours, and partake of the pleaſure, as he was kind enough to expreſs it, of my converſation. He had not yet ſeen my family, for as they came to my apartment by a door in the narrow paſſage, already deſcribed, by this means they avoided the common priſon. Jenkinſon at the firſt interview therefore ſeemed not a little ſtruck with the beauty of my youngeſt daughter, which her penſive air contributed to heighten, and my little ones did not paſs unnoticed.</p>
                     <p>"Alas, Doctor," cried he, "theſe children are too handſome and too good for ſuch a place as this!"</p>
                     <p>"Why, Mr. Jenkinſon," replied I, "thank heaven my children are pretty tolerable in morals, and if they be good, it matters little for the reſt."</p>
                     <p>"I fancy, ſir, returned my fellow priſoner, "that it muſt give you great comfort to have this little family a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout you."</p>
                     <p>A comfort, Mr. Jenkinſon," replied I, "yes it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a comfort, and I would not be without them for all the world; for they can make a dungeon ſeem a palace. There is but one way in this life of wounding my happineſs, and that is by injuring them."</p>
                     <p>"I am afraid then, ſir," cried he, "that I am in ſome meaſure culpable; for I think I ſee here (looking at my ſon Moſes) "one that I have injured, and by whom I wiſh to be forgiven."</p>
                     <p>My ſon immediately recollected his voice and features, though he had before ſeen him in diſguiſe taking him by the hand, with a ſmile forgave him. "Yet," continued he, "I can't help wondering at what you could ſee in my face, to think me a proper mark for deception."</p>
                     <p>"My dear ſir, returned the other, "it was not your face, but your white ſtockings and the black ribband in your hair that allured me But no diſparagement to your parts, I have deceived wiſer men than you in my time, and yet, with all my tricks, the blockheads have been too many for me at laſt."</p>
                     <p>"I ſuppoſe," cried my ſon, "that the narrative of ſuch a life as yours muſt be extremely inſtructive and amuſing."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="139" facs="unknown:012405_0137_0F89733E71AFAA60"/>"Not much of either," returned Mr. Jenkinſon. "Thoſe relations which deſcribe the tricks and vices only of mankind, by encreaſing our ſuſpicion in life, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard our ſucceſs. The traveller that diſtruſts every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he meets, and turns back upon the appearance of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man that looks like a robber, ſeldom arrives in time to his journey's end.</p>
                     <p>"Indeed I think from my own experience I may ſay, that the knowing one is the ſillieſt fellow under the ſun. I was thought cunning from my very childhood: when but ſeven years old the ladies would ſay that I was a perfect little man; at fourteen I knew the world, cocked my hat, and loved the ladies; at twenty, though I was perfectly honeſt, yet every one thought me ſo cunning, that not one would truſt me. Thus I was at laſt obliged to turn ſharper in my own defence, and have lived ever ſince, my head throbbing with ſchemes to deceive, and my heart palpitating with fears of detection.</p>
                     <p>"I uſed often to laugh at your honeſt ſimple neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Flamborough, and one way or another generally cheated him once a year. Yet ſtill the honeſt man went forward without ſuſpicion, and grew rich, while I ſtill continued trickſy and cunning, and was poor, without the conſolation of being honeſt.</p>
                     <p>"However," continued he, "let me know your caſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and what has brought you here; perhaps though I have not ſkill to avoid a goal myſelf, I may extricate my friends."</p>
                     <p>In compliance with his curioſity, I informed him of the whole train of accidents and follies that had plunged me into my preſent troubles, and my utter inability to get free.</p>
                     <p>After hearing my ſtory, and pauſing ſome minutes, he ſlapt his forehead, as if he had hit upon ſomething mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, and took his leave, ſaying he would try what could be done.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. VIII. The ſame Subject continued.</head>
                     <p>THE next morning I communicated to my wife and children the ſcheme I had planned of reforming the priſoners, which they received with univerſal diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, alledging the impoſſibility and impropriety of it; adding, that my endeavours would no way contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to their amendment, but might probably diſgrace my calling.</p>
                     <p>"Excuſe me," returned I,
<q>theſe people, however fallen, are ſtill men, and that is a very good title to my affections. Good council rejected, returns to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich the giver's boſom; and though the inſtruction I communicate may not mend them, yet it will aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mend myſelf. If theſe wretches, my children, were princes, there would be thouſands ready to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer their miniſtry; but, in my opinion, the heart that is buried in a dungeon is as precious as that ſeated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a throne. Yes, my treaſures, if I can mend them I will; perhaps they will not all deſpiſe me. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I may catch up even one from the gulph, and that will be great gain; for is there upon earth a gem ſo precious as the human ſoul?</q>

                     <p>Thus ſaying, I left them, and deſcended to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon priſon, where I found the priſoners very merry, expecting my arrival: and each prepared with ſome goal trick to play upon the doctor. Thus, as I was going to begin, one turned my wig awry, as if by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, and then aſked my pardon. A ſecond, who ſtood at ſome diſtance, had a knack of ſpitting through his teeth, which fell in ſhowers upon my book. A

However I took no notice of all that this miſchievous groupe of little beings could do; but went on, perfectly ſenſible that what was ridiculous in my attempt, would excite mirth only the firſt or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, while what was ſerious would be permanent. My deſign ſucceeded, and in leſs than ſix days ſome were penitent, and all attentive.</p>
                     <p>It was now that I applauded my perſeverance and addreſs, at thus giving ſenſibility to wretches diveſted of every moral feeling, and now began to think of doing them temporal ſervices alſo, by rendering their ſituation ſomewhat more comfortable. Their time had hitherto been divided between famine and exceſs, tumultuous riot and bitter repining. Their only employment was quarrelling among each other, playing cribbage, and cutting tobacco ſtoppers. From this laſt mode of idle induſtry I took the hint of ſetting ſuch as choſe to work at cutting pegs for tobacconiſts and ſhoemakers, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per wood being bought by a general ſubſcription, and when manufactured, ſold by my appointment; ſo that each earned ſomething every day: a trifle indeed, but ſufficient to maintain him.</p>
                     <p>I did not ſtop here, but inſtituted fines for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of immorality, and rewards for peculiar induſtry. Thus in leſs than a fortnight I had formed them into ſomething ſocial and humane, and had the pleaſure of regarding myſelf as a legiſlator, who had brought men from their native ferocity into friendſhip and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                     <p>And it were highly to be wiſhed, that legiſlative power would thus direct the law rather to reformation than ſeverity. That it would appear convinced that the work of eradicating crimes is not by making puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments familiar, but formidable. Inſtead of our preſent,
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:012405_0140_0F897340B37274B8"/>
priſons, which find or make men guilty, which encloſe wretches for the commiſſion of one crime, and return them, if returned alive, fitted for the perpetration of thouſands; it were to be wiſhed we had as in other parts of Europe, places of penitence and ſolitude, where the accuſed might be attended by ſuch as could give them repentance if guilty, or new motives to virtue if inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. And this, but not the increaſing puniſhments, is the way to mend a ſtate: nor can I avoid even queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning the validity of that right which ſocial combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations have aſſumed of capitally puniſhing offences of a ſlight nature. In caſes of murder their right is obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as it is the duty of us all, from the law of ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, to cut off that man who has ſhewn a diſregard for the life of another. Againſt ſuch, all nature riſes in arms; but it is not ſo againſt him who ſteals my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty. Natural law gives me no right to take away his life, as by that the horſe he ſteals is as much his property as mine. If then I have any right, it muſt be from a compact made between us, that he who deprives the other of his horſe, ſhall die. But this is a falſe compact; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no man has a right to barter his life, no more than to take it away, as it is not his own. And next the compact is inadequate, and would be ſet aſide even in a court of modern equity, as there is a great penalty for a very trifling convenience, ſince it is far better that two men ſhould live, than that one man ſhould ride.— But a compact that is falſe between two men, is equally ſo between an hundred, or an hundred thouſand; for as ten millions of circles can never make a ſquare, ſo the united voice of myriads cannot lend the ſmalleſt founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to falſehood. It is thus that reaſon ſpeaks, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutored nature ſays the ſame thing. Savages that are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected nearly by natural law alone are very tender of the lives of each other; they ſeldom ſhed blood but to reta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate former cruelty.</p>
                     <p>Our Saxon anceſtors, fierce as they were in war, had but few executions in times of peace; and in all commencing governments that have the print of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtill ſtrong upon them, ſcarce any crime is held capital.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="143" facs="unknown:012405_0141_0F8973417358F560"/>It is among the citizens of a refined community that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal laws, which are in the hands of the rich, are laid upon the poor. Government, while it grows older, ſeems to acquire the moroſeneſs of age; and as if our poſſeſſions were become dearer in proportion as they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, as if the more enormous our wealth, the more extenſive our fears, our poſſeſſions are paled up with new edicts every day, and hung round with gibbets to ſcare every invader.</p>
                     <p>Whether it is from the number of our penal laws, or the licentiouſneſs of our people, that this country ſhould ſhew more convicts in a year, than half the dominions of Europe united? Perhaps it is owing to both; for they mutually produce each other. When by indiſcriminate penal laws a nation beholds the ſame puniſhment affixed to diſſimilar degrees of guilt, from perceiving no diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the penalty, the people are led to loſe all ſenſe of diſtinction in the crime, and this diſtinction is the bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark of all morality: thus the multitude of laws pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce new vices, and new vices call for freſh reſtraints.</p>
                     <p>It were to be wiſhed then that power, inſtead of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving new laws to puniſh vice, inſtead of drawing hard the cords of ſociety till a convulſion come to burſt them, inſtead of cutting away wretches as uſeleſs, before we have tried their utility, inſtead of converting correction into vengeance, it were to be wiſhed that we tried the reſtrictive arts of government, and made law the protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, but not the tyrant of the people. We ſhould then find that creatures, whoſe ſouls are held as droſs, only wanted the hand of a refiner; we ſhould then find that wretches, now ſtuck up for long tortures, leſt luxury ſhould feel a momentary pang, might if properly treated, ſerve to ſinew the ſtat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>I HAD now been confined more than a fornight, but had not ſince my arrival been viſited by my dear Olivia, and I greatly longed to ſee her. Having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated my wiſhes to my wife, the next morning the poor girl entered my apartment, leaning on her ſiſter's arm. The change which I ſaw in her countenance ſtruck me. The numberleſs graces that once reſided there were now fled, and the hand of death ſeemed to have moulded every feature to alarm me. Her temples were ſunk, her forehead was tenſe, and a fatal paleneſs ſat up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her cheek.</p>
                     <p>"I am glad to ſee thee, my dear," cried I; "but why this dejection, Livy? I hope my love, you have too great a regard for me, to permit diſappointment thus to undermine a life which I prize as my own. Be chearful, child, and we may yet ſee happier days."</p>
                     <p>"You have ever, ſir," replied ſhe, "been kind to me, and it adds to my pain that I ſhall never have an oppor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Indeed, Sir, I wiſh you would make a proper ſubmiſſion to Mr. Thornhill; it may, in ſome meaſure, induce him to pity you, and it will give me relief in dying."</p>
                     <p>"Never, child," replied I, "I never ſhall be brought to acknowledge my daughter a proſtitute; for tho' the world may look upon your offence with ſcorn, let it be mine to regard it as a mark of credulity, not of guilt.

                     <p>After the departure of my daughter, my fellow pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, who was by at this interview, ſenſibly enough ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>ulated upon my obſtinacy, in refuſing a ſubmiſſion, which promiſed to give me freedom. He obſerved, that the reſt of my family was not to be ſacrificed to the peace of one child alone, and ſhe the only one who had offended me. "Beſide," added he, "I don't know if it be juſt thus to obſtruct the union of man and wife, which you do at preſent, by refuſing to conſent to a match which you cannot hinder, but may render un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy."</p>
                     <p>"Sir," replied I, "you are unacquainted with the man that oppr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſſes us. I am very ſenſible that no ſubmiſſion I can make could procure me liberty even for an hour. I am told that even in this very room a debtor of his, no later than laſt year, died for want. But though my ſubmiſſion and approbation could tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me from hence, to the moſt beautiful apartment he is poſſeſſed of, yet I would grant <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>; as ſomething whiſpers me that it would be giving a ſanction to adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. While my daughter lives, no other marriage of of his ſhall ever be legal in my eye. Were ſhe removed, indeed, I ſhould be the baſeſt of men, from any reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my own, to attempt putting aſunder thoſe who wiſh for an union. No, villain as he is, I could then wiſh him married, to prevent the conſequences of his future debaucheries. But ſhould I not now be the moſt cruel of all fathers, to ſign an inſtrument which muſt ſend my child to the grave, merely to avoid a priſon myſelf; and thus to eſcape one pang, break my child's heart with a thouſand?</p>
                     <p>He acquieſced in the juſtice of this anſwer, but could not avoid obſerving, that he feared my daughter's life was already too much waſted to keep me long a priſoner. "However, continued he, though you refuſe to ſubmit to the nephew, I hope you have no objections to lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your caſe before the uncle, who has the firſt cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter in the kingdom for every thing that is juſt and good. I would adviſe you to ſend him a letter by the

poſt intimating all his nephew's ill uſage, and my life for it that in three days you ſhall have an anſwer." I thank'd him for the hin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> and inſtantly ſet about com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying; but I wanted paper, and unluckily all our money had been laid out that morning in proviſions, however he ſupplied me.</p>
                     <p>For the three enſuing days I was in a ſtate of anxiety, to know what reception my letter might meet with; but in the mean time was frequently ſolicited by my wife to ſubmit to any conditions rather than remain here, and every hour received repeated accounts of the decline of my daughter's health. The third day and the fourth arrived, but I received no anſwer to my letter: the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of a ſtranger againſt a favourite nephew, were no way likely to ſucceed; ſo that theſe hopes ſoon va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed like all my former. My mind, however, ſtill ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported itſelf though confinement and bad air began to make a viſible alteration in my health, and my arm that had ſuffered in the fire, grew worſe. But my children ſtill ſat by me, and while I was ſtretched on my ſtraw, read to me by turns, or liſtned and wept at my inſruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But my daughter's health declined faſter than mine; every meſſage from her contributed to encreaſe my apprehenſions and pain. The fifth morning after I had written the letter which was ſent to Sir William Thornhill, I was alarmed with an account that ſhe was ſpeechleſs. Now it was that confinement was truly painful to me: my ſoul was burſting from its priſon to be near the pillow of my child, to comfort, to ſtrengthen her, to receive her laſt wiſhes, and teach her ſoul the way to heaven! Another account came. She was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring, and yet I was debarred the ſmall comfort of weeping by her. My fellow priſoner, ſome time after, came with the laſt account. He bade me be patient. She was dead!—The next morning he returned, and found me with my two little ones, now my only compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, who were uſing all their innocent efforts to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort me. They entreated to read to me, and bid me not to cry, for I was now too old to weep. "And is not my ſiſter an angel, now, papa," cried the eldeſt, "and why then are you ſorry for her? I wiſh I were an angel out of this frightful place, if my papa were with me." Yes," added my youngeſt darling, "Heaven where my ſiſter
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:012405_0145_0F8973449889D470"/>
is, is a finer place than this, and there are none but good people there, and the people here are very bad."</p>
                     <p>Mr. Jenkinſon interrupted their harmleſs prattle, by obſerving that now my daughter was no more I ſhould ſeriouſly think of the reſt of my family, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to ſave my own life, which was every day declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for want of neceſſaries and wholſome air. He added, that it was now incumbent on me to ſacrifice any pride or reſentment of my own, to the welfare of thoſe who depended on me for ſupport; and that I was now, both by reaſon and juſtice, obliged to try to reconcile my landlord.</p>
                     <p>"Heaven be praiſed," replied I, "there is no pride left me now, I ſhould deteſt my own heart if I ſaw either pride, or reſentment lurking there. On the contrary, as my oppreſſor has been once my pariſhioner, I hope one day to preſent him up an unpolluted ſoul at the eternal tribunal. No, ſir, I have no reſentment now, and though he has taken from me what I held dearer than all his treaſures, though he has wrung my heart, for I am ſick almoſt to fainting, very ſick, my fellow priſoner, yet that ſhall never inſpire me with vengeance. I am now willing to approve his marriage, and if this ſubmiſſion can do him any pleaſure, let him know, that if I have done him any injury, I am ſorry for it." Mr. Jenkinſon took pen and ink, and wrote down my ſubmiſſion nearly as I have expreſt it, to which I ſigned my name. My ſon was employed to carry the letter to Mr. Thornhill, who was then at his ſeat in the country. He went, and in about ſix hours returned with a verbal anſwer. He had ſome difficulty, he ſaid, to get a ſight of his landlord, as the ſervants were inſolent and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious; but he accidently ſaw him as he was going out upon buſineſs, preparing for his marriage, which was to be in three days. He continued to inform us, that he ſtept up in the humbleſt manner, and delivered the letter, which, when Mr. Thornhill had read, he ſaid that all ſubmiſſion was now too late and unneceſſary; that he had heard of our application to his uncle, which met with the contempt it deſerved; and as for the reſt, that all future applications ſhould be directed to his attorney, not to him. He obſerved, however, that as he
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:012405_0146_0F89734620E96A40"/>
had a very good opinion of the diſcretion of the two young ladies, they might have been the moſt agreeable interceſſors.</p>
                     <p>"Well, ſir," ſaid I to my fellow priſoner, "you now diſcover the temper of the man that oppreſſes me. He can at once be facetious and cruel; but let him uſe me as he will, I ſhall ſoon be free, in ſpite of all his bolts to reſtrain me. I am now drawing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards an abode that looks brighter as I approach it: this expectation cheers my afflictions; and though I ſhall leave an helpleſs family of orphans behind me, yet they will not be utterly forſaken; ſome friend, perhaps, will be found to aſſiſt them for the ſake of their poor father, and ſome may charitably relieve them for the ſake of their heavenly father."</p>
                     <p>Juſt as I ſpoke, my wife, whom I had not ſeen that day before, appeared with looks of terror, and making efforts, but unable to ſpeak. "Why, my love," cried I, "why will you thus encreaſe my affliction by your own; what though no ſubmiſſions can turn our ſevere maſter, though he has doomed me to die in this place of wretchedneſs, and though we have loſt a darling child, yet ſtill you will find comfort in your other children when I ſhall be no more." "We have indeed loſt," returned ſhe, "a darling child. My Sophia, my deareſt, is gone, ſnatched from us, carried off by ruffians."</p>
                     <p>"How, madam," cried my fellow priſoner, " Miſs Sophia carried off by villains, ſure it cannot be?"</p>
                     <p>She could only anſwer with a fixed look and a flood of tears. But one of the priſoners wives, who was preſent, and came in with her, gave us a more diſtinct account: ſhe informed us that as my wife, my daughter, and her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, were taking a walk together on the great road a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle way out of the village, a poſt-chaiſe and four drove up to them and inſtantly ſtopt. Upon which, a well-dreſt man, but not Mr. Thornhill, ſtepping out, claſped my daughter round the waiſt, and forcing her in, bid the poſtillion drive on, ſo that they were out of ſight in a moment.</p>
                     <p>"Now," cried I, "the ſum of my miſeries is made up, nor is it in the power of any thing on earth to
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:012405_0147_0F89734709556398"/>
give me another pang. What! not one left! not to leave me one! the monſter! the child that was next my heart! ſhe had the beauty of an angel, and almoſt the wiſdom of an angel. But ſupport that woman, nor let her fall. Not to leave me one!"—"Alas! my huſhand," ſaid my wife, "you ſeem to want comfort even more than I. Our diſtreſſes are great; but I could bear this and more, if I ſaw you but eaſy. They may take away my children and all the world, if they leave me but you."</p>
                     <p>My ſon, who was preſent, endeavoured to moderate our grief; he bade us take comfort, for he hoped that we might ſtill have reaſon to be thankful—"My child," cried I, "look round the world, and ſee if there be any happineſs left me now. Is not every ray of comfort ſhut out; while all our bright proſpects only lie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the grave!"—"My dear father," returned he, "I hope there is ſtill ſomething that will give you an interval of ſatisfaction; for I have a letter from my brother George,"—"What of him, child," interrupted I, does he know of our miſery. I hope my boy is exempt from any part of what his wretched family ſuffers?"— Yes, ſir," returned he, "he is perfectly gay, chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and happy. His letter brings nothing but good news; he is the favourite of his colonel, who promiſes to procure him the very next lieutenancy that becomes vacant!"</p>
                     <p>"And are you ſure of all this," cried my wife, "are you ſure that nothing ill has befallen my boy?"— Nothing indeed, madam," returned my ſon, "you ſhall ſee the letter, which will give you the higheſt pleaſure; and if any thing can procure you comfort I am ſure that will." "But are you ſure," ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated ſhe, "that the letter is from himſelf, and that he is really ſo happy?"—"Yes, madam," replied he, it is certainly his, and he will one day be the credit and the ſupport of our family!"—"Then I thank providence," cried ſhe, "that my laſt letter to him has miſcarried. Yes, my dear," continued ſhe, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me, "I will now confeſs that though the hand of heaven is ſore upon us in other inſtances, it has been favourable here. By the laſt letter I wrote my ſon,
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:012405_0148_0F8973477480B450"/>
which was in the bitterneſs of anger, I deſired him, upon his mother's bleſſing, and if he had the heart of a man, to ſee juſtice done his father and ſiſter, and avenge our cauſe. But thanks be to him that directs all things, it has miſcarried and I am at reſt."— "Woman," cried I, "thou haſt done very ill, and at another time my reproaches might have been more ſevere. Oh! what a tremendous gulph haſt thou eſcaped, that would have buried both thee and him in endleſs ruin. Providence, indeed, has here been kinder to us than we to ourſelves. It has reſerved that ſon to be the father and protector of my children when I ſhall be away. How unjuſtly did I complain of being ſtript of every comfort, when I ſtill hear that he is happy and inſenſible of our afflictions; ſtill kept in reſerve to ſupport his widowed mother, to protect his brothers and ſiſters. But what ſiſters has he left, he has no ſiſters now, they are all gone, robbed from me, and I am undone."— "Father," interrupted my ſon, "I beg you will give me leave to read his letter, I know it will pleaſe you." Upon which, with my permiſſion, he read as follows:</p>

                     <p>"In all our miſeries," cried I, "what thanks have we not to return, that one at leaſt of our family is exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from what we ſuffer. Heaven be his guard, and keep my boy thus happy to be the ſupporter of his wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed mother, and the father of theſe two babes, which are all the patrimony I can now bequeath him. May he keep their innocence from the temptations of want, and be their conductor in the paths of honour." I had ſcarce ſaid theſe words, when a noiſe, like that of a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult, ſeemed to proceed from the priſon below; it died away ſoon after, and a clanking of ſetters was heard along the paſſage that led to my apartment. The keeper of the priſon entered, holding a man all bloody, wounded and fettered with the heavieſt irons. I looked with compaſſion on the wretch as he approached me, but with horror when I found it was my own ſon.— "My George! My George! and do I behold thee thus? Wounded! Fettered! Is this thy happineſs! Is this the manner you return to me! O that this ſight could break my heart at once and let me die!"</p>
                     <p>"Where, Sir, is your fortitude," returned my ſon with an intrepid voice. "I muſt ſuffer, my life is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>I tried to reſtrain my paſſions for a few minutes in ſilence, but I thought I ſhould have died with the effort. —"O my boy, my heart weeps to behold thee thus,

and I cannot, cannot help it. In the moment that I thought thee bleſt, and prayed for thy ſafety, to behold thee thus again! Chained, wounded. And yet the death of the youthful is happy. But I am old, a very old man, and have lived to ſee this day. To ſee my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren all untimely falling about me, while I continue a wretched ſurvivor in the midſt of ruin! May all the curſes that ever ſunk a ſoul fall heavy upon the murderer of my children. May he live, like me, to ſee—"</p>
                     <p>"Hold, Sir," replied my ſon, "or I ſhall bluſh for thee. How, Sir, forgetful of your age, your holy calling, thus to arrogate the juſtice of heaven, and fling thoſe curſes upward that muſt ſoon deſcend to cruſh thy own grey head with deſtruction! No, Sir, let it be your care now to fit me for that vile death I muſt ſhortly ſuffer, to arm me with hope and reſolution, to give me courage to drink of that bitterneſs which muſt ſhortly be my por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion"</p>
                     <p>"My child, you muſt not die: I am ſure no offence of thine can deſerve ſo vile a puniſhment. My George could never be guilty of any crime to make his anceſtors aſhamed of him."</p>
                     <p>"Mine, Sir," returned my ſon, "is, I fear, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable one. I have ſent a challenge, and that is death by a late-act of parliament. When I received my mother's letter from home, I immediately came down, determined to puniſh the betrayer of our honour and ſent him an order to meet me, which he anſwered, not in perſon, but by his diſpatching four of his domeſtics to ſeize me. I wounded one, but the reſt made me their priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. The coward is determined to put the law in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt me, the proofs are undeniable; and as I am the firſt tranſgreſſor upon the ſtatute, I ſee no hopes of pardon. But you have often charmed me with the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of fortitude, let me now, Sir, find them in your example,"</p>
                     <p>"And, my ſon, you ſhall find them. I am now raiſed above this world, and all the pleaſures it can produce. From this moment I break from my heart all the ties that held it down to earth, and will prepare to fit us both for eternity. Yes, my ſon, I will point out the way, and my ſoul ſhall guide yours in the aſcent, for

we will take our flight together. I now ſee and am convinced you can expect no pardon here, and I can only exhort you to ſeek it at that greateſt tribunal where we both ſhall ſhortly anſwer. But let us not be niggardly in our exhortation, but let all our fellow priſoners have a ſhare: good gaoler, let them be permitted to ſtand here, while I attempt to improve them." Thus ſaying, I made an effort to riſe from my ſtraw, but wanted ſtrength, and was able only to recline againſt the wall. The priſoners aſſembled according to my directions, for they loved to hear my council, my ſon and his mother ſupported me on either ſide, I looked and ſaw that none were wanting, and then addreſſed them with the following exhortation.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. X. The equal dealings of providence demonſtrated with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the happy and the miſerable here below. That from the nature of pleaſure and pain, the wretched muſt be repaid the balance of their ſufferings in the life hereafter.</head>
                     <p>MY friends, my children, and fellow-ſufferers, when I reflect on the diſtribution of good and evil here below, I find that much has been given man to enjoy, yet ſtill more to ſuffer. Though we ſhould examine the whole world, we ſhall not find one man ſo happy as to have nothing left to wiſh for; but we daily ſee thouſands who by ſuicide ſhew us they have nothing left to hope. In this life then it appears that we cannot be entirely bleſt, but yet we may be completely miſerable!</p>
                     <p>Why man ſhould thus feel pain, why our wretchedneſs ſhould be requiſite in the formation of univerſal felicity, why, when all other ſyſtems are made perfect only by the perfection of their ſubordinate parts, the great ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem ſhould require for its perfection, parts that are not only ſubordinate to others, but imperfect in themſelves?
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:012405_0152_0F89734B33841470"/>
Theſe are queſtions that never can be explained, and might be uſeleſs if known. On this ſubject providence has thought fit to elude our curioſity, ſatisfied with granting us motives to conſolation</p>
                     <p>In this ſituation, man has called in the friendly aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of philoſophy, and heaven ſeeing the incapacity of that to conſole him, has given him the aid of religion. The conſolations of philoſophy are very amuſing, but often fallacious. It tells us that life is filled with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, if we will but enjoy them; and on the other hand, that though we unavoidably have miſeries here, life is ſhort, and they will ſoon be over. Thus do theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations deſtroy each other; for if life is a place of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, its ſhortneſs muſt be miſery, and if it be long, our griefs are protracted. Thus philoſophy is weak; but religion comforts in an higher ſtrain. Man is here, it tells us, ſitting up his mind, and preparing it for another abode. When the good man leaves the body and is all a glorious mind, he will find he has been making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a heaven of happineſs here, while the wretch that has been maimed and contaminated by his vices ſhrinks from his body with terror, and finds that he has antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated the vengeance of heaven. To religion then we muſt hold in every circumſtance of life for our trueſt comfort; for if already we are happy, it is a pleaſure to think that we can make that happineſs unending, and if we are miſerable, it is very conſoling to think that there is a place of reſt. Thus to the fortunate religion holds out a continuance of bliſs, to the wretched a change from pain.</p>
                     <p>But though religion is very kind to all men, it has promiſed peculiar reward to the unhappy; the ſick, the naked, the houſeleſs, the heavy-laden, and the priſoner<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> have ever moſt frequent promiſes in our ſacred law. The author of our religion every where profeſſes himſelf the wretch's friend, and unlike the falſe ones of this world beſtows all his careſſes upon the forlorn. The unthink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing have cenſured this as partiality, as a preference with out merit to deſerve it. But they never reflect that it is not in the power even of heaven itſelf to make the offer of unceaſing felicity as great a gift to the happy as to the miſerable. To the firſt eternity is but a ſingle bleſſing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <pb n="155" facs="unknown:012405_0153_0F89734BF10A69B0"/>
ſince at moſt it but encreaſes what they already poſſeſs. To the latter it is a double advantage; for it dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes their pain here, and rewards them with heavenly bliſs hereafter.</p>
                     <p>But providence is in another reſpect kinder to the poor than the rich; for as it thus makes the life after death more deſirable, ſo it ſmooths the paſſage there. The wretched have long familiarity with every face of terror. The man of ſorrows lays himſelf quietly down, he has no poſſeſſions to regret, and but few ties to ſtop his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture: he feels only nature's pang in the final ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and this is no way greater than he has often fainted under before; for after a certain degree of pain, every new breach that death opens in the conſtitution, nature kindly covers with inſenſibility.</p>
                     <p>Thus providence has given the wretched two advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages over the happy in this life, greater felicity in dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and in heaven all that ſuperiority of pleaſure which ariſes from contraſted enjoyment. And this ſuperiority, my friends, is no ſmall advantage, and ſeems to be one of the pleaſures of the poor man in the parable; for though he was already in heaven; and felt all the rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures it could give, yet it was mentioned as an addition to his happineſs, that he had once been wretched and now was comforted, that he had known what it was to be miſerable, and now felt what it was to be happy.</p>
                     <p>Thus, my friends, you ſee religion does what philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy could never do: it ſhews the equal dealings of heaven to the happy and to the unhappy, and levels all human enjoyments to nearly the ſame ſtandard. It gives to both rich and poor the ſame happineſs hereafter, and equal hopes to aſpire after it; but if the rich have the advantage of enjoying pleaſure here, the poor have the endleſs ſatisfaction of knowing what it was once to be miſerable, when crowned with endleſs felicity hereafter; and even though this ſhould be called a ſmall advantage, yet being an eternal one, it muſt make up by duration what the temporal happineſs of the great may have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by intenſeneſs.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are therefore the conſolations which the wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed have peculiar to themſelves, and in which they are above the reſt of mankind; in other reſpects they are
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:012405_0154_0F89734D777E7B60"/>
below them. They who would know the miſeries of the poor muſt ſee life and endure it. To declaim on the temporal advantages they enjoy, is only repeating what none either believe or practiſe. The men who have the neceſſaries of living are not poor, and they who want them muſt be miſerable. Yes, my friends we muſt be miſerable. No vain efforts of a refined imagination can ſooth the wants of nature, can give elaſtic ſweetneſs to the dank vapour of a dungeon, or eaſe to the throbbings of a woe-worn heart. Let the philoſopher from his couch of ſoftneſs tell us that we can reſiſt all theſe. Alas! the effort by which we reſiſt them is ſtill the greateſt pain! Death is ſlight, and any man ſuſtains it; but tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are dreadful, and theſe no man can endure.</p>
                     <p>To us then, my friends, the promiſes of happineſs in heaven ſhould be peculiarly dear; for if our reward be in this life alone, we are then indeed of all men the moſt miſerable. When I look round theſe gloomy walls, made to terrify, as well as to confine us: this light that only ſerves to ſhew the horrors of the place, thoſe ſhackles that tyranny has impoſed, or crime made neceſſary: when I ſurvey theſe emaciated looks, and hear thoſe groans, O my friends, what a glorious exchange would heaven be for theſe. To fly through regions unconfin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as air, to baſk in the ſunſhine of eternal bliſs, to carol over endleſs hymns of praiſe, to have no maſter to threaten or inſult us, but the form of goodneſs himſelf for ever in our eyes, when I think of theſe things, death becomes the meſſenger of very glad tidings; when I think of theſe things, his ſharpeſt arrow becomes the ſtaff of my ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; when I think of theſe things, what is there in life worth having? When I think of theſe things, what is there that ſhould not be ſpurned away? Kings in their palaces ſhould groan for ſuch advantages; but we, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled as we are, ſhould yearn for them.</p>
                     <p>And ſhall theſe things be ours? Ours they will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be, if we but try for them; and what is a comfort, we are ſhut out from many temptations that would retard our purſuit. Only let us try for them: and they will certainly be ours, and what is ſtill a comfort, ſhortly too; for if we look back on paſt life, it appears but a very ſhort ſpan, and whatever we may think of the reſt
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:012405_0155_0F89734E706E6830"/>
of life, it will yet be found of leſs duration; as we grow older the days ſeem to grow ſhorter, and our intimacy with time ever leſſens the perception of his ſtay. Then let us take comfort now, for we ſhall ſoon be at our journey's end; we ſhall ſoon lay down the heavy burthen laid by heaven upon us, and though death, the only friend of the wretched, for a little while mocks the weary traveller with the view, and like his horizon, ſtill flies before him; yet the time will certainly and ſhortly come, when we ſhall ceaſe from our toil; when the luxurious great ones of the world ſhall no more tread us to the earth; when we ſhall think with pleaſure on our ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings below; when we ſhall be ſurrounded with all our friends, or ſuch as deſerved our friendſhip; when our bliſs ſhall be unutterable, and ſtill, to crown all, unending.</p>

Moſes came running in a moment after, crying out that his ſiſter Sophy was below, and coming up with our old friend Mr. Burchell.</p>
                     <p>Juſt as he delivered this news my deareſt girl entered, and with looks almoſt wild with pleaſure, ran to kiſs me in a tranſport of affection. Her mother's tears and ſilence alſo ſhewed her pleaſure—"Here, papa," cried the charming girl, "here is the brave man to whom I owe "my delivery; to this gentleman's intrepidity I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted for my happineſs and ſafety.—" A kiſs from Mr. Burchell, whoſe pleaſure ſeemed even greater than hers, interrupted what ſhe was going to add.</p>
                     <p>"Ah, Mr. Burchell," cried I, "this is but a wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed habitation you now find us in; and we are now very different from what you laſt ſaw us. You were ever our friend: we have long diſcovered our errors with regard to you, and repented of our ingratitude. After the vile uſage you then received at my hands, I am almoſt aſhamed to behold your face; yet I hope you'll forgive me, as I was deceived by a baſe ungene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous wretch, who, under the maſk of friendſhip has undone me."</p>
                     <p>"It is impoſſible," replied Mr. Burchell, "that I ſhould forgive you, as you never deſerved my reſentment. I partly ſaw your deluſion then, and as it was out of my power to reſtrain, I could only pity it!"</p>
                     <p>"It was ever my conjecture," cried I, "that your mind was noble; but now I find it ſo. But tell me, my dear child, how haſt thou been relieved, or who the ruffians were who carried thee away?"</p>
                     <p>"Indeed, Sir," replied ſhe, "as to the villain who brought me off, I am yet ignorant. For as my mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma and I were walking out, he came behind us, and almoſt before I could call for help, forced me into the poſt-chaiſe, and in an inſtant the horſes drove away. I met ſeveral on the road, to whom I cried out for aſſiſtance; but they diſregarded my entreaties. In the mean time the ruffian himſelf uſed every art to hinder me from crying out: he flattered and threatened by turns, and ſwore that if I continued but ſilent, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended no harm. In the mean time I had broken the canvas that he had drawn up, and whom ſhould I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

at ſome diſtance but your old friend Mr. Burchell, walking along with his uſual ſwiftneſs, with the great ſtick for which we uſed ſo much to ridicule him. As ſoon as we came within hearing, I called out to him by name, and entreated his help. I repeated my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations ſeveral times, upon which, with a very loud voice, he bid the poſtilion ſtop; but the boy took no notice, but drove on with ſtill greater ſpeed. I now thought he could never overtake us, when in leſs than a minute I ſaw Mr. Burchell come running up by the ſide of the horſes, and with one blow knock the poſtilion to the ground. The horſes when he was fallen ſoon ſtopt of themſelves, and the ruffian ſtepping out, with oaths and menaces drew his ſword, and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him at his peril to retire; but Mr. Burchell run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning up, ſhivered his ſword to pieces, and then pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued him for near a quarter of a mile; but he made his eſcape. I was at this time come out myſelf, willing to aſſiſt my deliverer; but he ſoon returned to me in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph. The poſtilion, who was recovered, was going to make his eſcape too; but Mr. Burchell ordered him at his peril to mount again, and drive back to town. Finding it impoſſible to reſiſt, he reluctantly complied, though the wound he had received ſeemed, to me at leaſt, to be dangerous. He continued to complain of the pain as we drove along, ſo that he at laſt excited Mr. Burchell's compaſſion, who, at my requeſt, exchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him for another at an inn where we called on our return."</p>
                     <p>"Welcome then," cried I, "my child, and thou her gallant deliverer, a thouſand welcomes.

                     <p>"If your preſent objection," replied I, be meant as an evaſion of my offer, I deſiſt: but I know no man ſo worthy to deſerve her as you; and if I could give her thouſands, and thouſands ſought her from me, yet my honeſt brave Burchell ſhould be my deareſt choice."</p>
                     <p>To all this his ſilence alone ſeemed to give a mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing refuſal, and without the leaſt reply to my offer, he, demanded if we could not be furniſhed with refreſhment from the next inn? To which being anſwered in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative, he ordered them to ſend in the beſt dinner that could be provided upon ſuch ſhort notice. He beſpoke alſo a dozen of their beſt wine; and ſome cordials for me. Adding, with a ſmile, that he would ſtretch a little for once, and tho' in a priſon, aſſerted he was never better diſpoſed to be merry. The waiter ſoon made his appearance with preparations for dinner, a table was lent us by the gaoler, who ſeemed remarkably aſſiduous, the wine was diſpoſed in order, and two very well-dreſt diſhes were brought in.</p>
                     <p>My daughter had not yet heard of her poor brother's melancholy ſituation, and we all ſeemed unwilling to damp her chearfulneſs by the relation.

are fallen very low, yet providence has been pleaſed to grant us ſome ſmall relaxation from pain.

                     <p>My ſon ſeemed all this while regardleſs of what I ſaid, and ſtill continued fixed at reſpectful diſtance—"My dear brother," cried his ſiſter, "why don't you thank my good deliverer; the brave ſhould ever love each other."</p>
                     <p>He ſtill continued his ſilence and aſtoniſhment, till our gueſt at laſt perceived himſelf to be known, and aſſuming all his native dignity, deſired my ſon to come forward. Never before had I ſeen any thing ſo truly majeſtic as the air he aſſumed upon this occaſion. The greateſt object in the univerſe, ſays a certain philoſopher, is a good man ſtruggling with adverſity; yet there is ſtill a greater, which is the good man that comes to relieve it. After he had regarded my ſon for ſome time with a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior air, "I again find," ſaid he, "unthinking boy, that the ſame crime"—But here he was interrupted by one of the gaoler's ſervants, who came to inform us that a perſon of diſtinction, who had driven into town with a chariot and ſeveral attendants, ſent his reſpects to the gentleman that was with us, and begged to know when he ſhould think proper to be waited upon.— "Bid the fellow wait, cried our gueſt, till I ſhall have leiſure to receive him;" and then turning to my ſon, "I again find, Sir," proceeded he, "that you are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ſame offence for which you once had my reproof, and for which the law is now preparing its juſteſt puniſhment. You imagine, perhaps, that a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt for your own life, gives you a right to take that of another: but where, Sir, is the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a dueliſt who hazards a life of no value, and the murderer who acts with greater ſecurity?

of her reſentment required him upon her bleſſing to avenge her quarrel. Here, Sir is the letter, which will ſerve to convince you of her imprudence and diminiſh his guilt"</p>
                     <p>He took the letter and haſtily read it over. "This," ſays he, though not a perfect excuſe, is ſuch a palliation of his fault, as induces me to forgive him: And now, Sir" continued he, kindly taking my ſon by the hand, "I ſee you are ſurprized at finding me here; but I have often viſited priſons upon occaſions leſs intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I am now come to ſee juſtice done a worthy man, for whom I have the moſt ſincere eſteem. I have long been a diſguiſed ſpectator of thy father's benevolence. I have at his little dwelling enjoyed reſpect uncontamina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by flattery, and have received that happineſs that courts could not give, from the amuſing ſimplicity round his fire-ſide. My nephew has been apprized of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of coming here, and I find is arrived; it wou'd be wronging him and you to condemn him without examination: if there be injury, there ſhall be redreſs; and this' I may ſay without boaſting, that none have ever taxed the injuſtice of Sir William Thornhill.</p>
                     <p>We now found the perſonage whom we had ſo long entertained as an harmleſs amuſing companion, was no other than the celebrated Sir William Thornhill, to whoſe virtues and ſingularities ſcarce any were ſtrangers. The poor Mr. Burchell was in reality a man of large for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and great intereſt, to whom ſenates liſtened with applauſe, and whom party heard with conviction; who was the friend of his country, but loyal to his king. My poor wife recollecting her former familiarity, ſeemed to ſhrink with apprehenſion; but Sophia, who a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments before thought him her own, now perceiving the immenſe diſtance to which he was removed by fortune, was unable to conceal her tears.</p>

If your honour will bid Mr. Gaoler let two of his men go with me, I'll engage to produce him to you in an hour at fartheſt. Upon this the gaoler was called, who inſtantly appearing, Sir William demanded if he knew him. "Yes, pleaſe your honour," reply'd the gaoler, "I know Sir William Thornhill well, and every body that knows any thing of him, will deſire to know more of him."—"Well then," ſaid the baronet, "my requeſt is, that you will permit this man and two of your ſervants to go upon a meſſage by my authority and as I am in the commiſſion of the peace, I undertake to ſecure you."—"Your promiſe is ſufficient," replied the other, and you may at a minute's warning ſend them over England whenever your honour thinks fit."</p>
                     <p>In purſuance of the gaoler's compliance, Jenkinſon was diſpatched in ſearch of Timothy Baxter, while we were amuſed with the affiduity of our youngeſt boy Bill, who

His mother was immediately going to chaſtiſe his familiarity, but the worthy man prevented her; and taking the child, all ragged as he was, upon his knee, "What, Bill, you chubby rogue," cried he, "do you remember your old friend Burchell; and Dick too, my honeſt veteran, are you here, you ſhall find I have not forgot you." So ſaying, he gave each a large piece of gingerbread, which the poor fellows eat very heartily, as they had got that morning but a very ſcanty breakfaſt.</p>

                     <p>MR. Thornhill made his entrance with a ſmile, which he ſeldom wanted, and was going to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace his uncle, which the other repulſed with an air of diſdain. "No fawning, Sir, at preſent," cried the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronet, with a look of ſeverity, "the only way to my heart is by the road of honour; but here I only ſet complicated inſtances of falſehood, cowardice, and oppreſſion. How is it, Sir, that this poor man, for whom I know you profeſſed a friendſhip, is uſed thus

hardly? His daughter vilely ſeduced, as a recompence for his hoſpitality, and he himſelf thrown into a priſon perhaps but for reſenting the inſult? His ſon too, whom you feared to face as a man—"</p>
                     <p>"Is it poſſible, Sir," interrupted his nephew, "that my uncle could object that as a crime which his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated inſtructions alone have perſuaded me to avoid." "Your rebuke," cried Sir, William, "is juſt: you have acted in this inſtance prudently and well, though not quite as your father would have done: my brother indeed was the ſoul of honour; but thou—yes you have acted in this inſtance perfectly right, and it has my warmeſt approbation."</p>
                     <p>"And I hope," ſaid his nephew, "that the reſt of my conduct will not be found to deſerve cenſure. I appeared, Sir, with this gentleman's daughter at ſome places of public amuſement: thus what was levity, ſcandal called by a harſher name, and it was reported that I had debauched her. I waited on her father in perſon, willing to clear the thing to his ſatisfaction, and he received me only with inſult and abuſe. As for the reſt, with regard to his being here, my attorney and ſteward can beſt inform you, as I commit the management of buſineſs entirely to them. If he has contracted debts and is unwilling or even unable to pay them, it is their buſineſs to proceed in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and I ſee no hardſhip or injuſtice in purſuing the moſt legal means of redreſs."</p>
                     <p>"If this, cried Sir William, "be as you have ſtated it, there is nothing unpardonable in your offence; and though your conduct might have been more generous in not ſuffering this gentleman to be oppreſſed by ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate tyranny, yet it has been at leaſt equitable."</p>
                     <p>"He cannot contradict a ſingle particular," replied the 'ſquire, "I defy him to do ſo, and ſeveral of my ſervants are ready to atteſt what I ſay. Thus, Sir," continued he, finding that I was ſilent, for in fact I could not contradict him, "thus, Sir, my own innocence is vindicated; but though at your entreaty I am ready to forgive this gentleman every other offence, yet his attempts to leſſen me in your eſteem, excite a reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that I cannot govern.—And this too at a time
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:012405_0164_0F897355F5254920"/>
when his ſon was actually preparing to take away my life; this, I ſay, was ſuch guilt, that I am determined to let the law take its courſe. I have here the challenge that was ſent me and two witneſſes to prove it; and even though my uncle himſelf ſhould diſſuade me, which I know he will not, yet I will ſee public juſtice done, and he ſhall ſuffer for it."</p>
                     <p>"Thou monſter," cried my wife, "haſt thou not had vengeance enough already, but muſt my poor boy feel thy cruelty. I hope that good Sir William will protect us, for my ſon is as innocent as a child; I am ſure he is, and never did harm to man."</p>
                     <p>"Madam," replied the good man, "your wiſhes for his ſafety are not greater than mine; but I am ſorry to find his guilt too plain; and if my nephew perſiſts—" But the appearance of Jenkinſon and the gaoler's two ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants now called off our attention, who entered, haling in a tall man, very genteelly dreſt, and anſwering the deſcription already given of the ruffian who had carried off my daughter—"Here," cried Jenkinſon, pulling him in, "here we have him, and if ever there was a candidate for Tyburn, this is one."</p>
                     <p>The moment Mr. Thornhill perceived the priſoner, and Jenkinſon who had him in cuſtody, he ſeemed to ſhrink back with terror. His face became pale with conſcious guilt, and he would have withdrawn; but Jenkinſon, who perceived his deſign, ſtopt him— "What, 'ſquire, cried he, "are you aſhamed of your two old acquaintances, Jenkinſon and Baxter: but this is the way that all great men forget their friends, though I am reſolved we will not forget you.— Our priſoner, pleaſe your honour," continued he, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Sir William, "has already confeſſed all.— He declares that it was Mr. Thornhill who firſt put him upon this affair, that he gave him the cloaths he now wears to appear like a gentleman, and furniſhed him with the poſt-chaiſe. The plan was laid between them that he ſhould carry off the young lady to a place of ſafety, and that there he ſhould threaten and terrify her; but Mr. Thornhill was to come in, in the mean time, as if by accident, to her reſcue, and that they ſhould fight a while, and then he was to ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

off, by which Mr. Thornhill would have the better op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of gaining her affections himſelf under the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of her defender."</p>
                     <p>Sir William remembered the coat to have been fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently worn by his nephew, and all the reſt the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner himſelf confirmed by a more circumſtantial account; concluding, that Mr. Thornhill had often declared to him that he was in love with both ſiſters at the ſame time.</p>
                     <p>"Heavens," cried Sir William, "what a viper have I been foſtering in my boſom! And ſo fond of public juſtice too as he ſeemed to be. But he ſhall have it; ſecure him, Mr. Gaoler—yet hold, I fear there is not legal evidence to detain him."</p>
                     <p>Upon this, Mr. Thornhill, with the utmoſt humility, entreated that two ſuch abandoned wretches might not be admitted as evidences againſt him, but that his ſervants ſhould be examined.—"Your ſervants" replied Sir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam, "wretch, call them yours no longer: but come let us hear what thoſe fellows have to ſay, let his butler be called."</p>
                     <p>When the butler was introduced, he ſoon perceived by his former maſter's looks that all his power was now over. "Tell me," cried Sir William ſternly, "have you ever ſeen your maſter and that fellow dreſt up in his cloaths in company together?" "Yes, pleaſe your honour," cried the butler, "a thouſand times: he was the man that always brought him his ladies."— "How," interrupted young Mr. Thornhill, "this to my face!"—"Yes," replied the butler, "or to any man's face. To tell you a truth, maſter Thornhill, I never either loved you or liked you, and I don't care if I tell you now a piece of my mind."—"Now then," cried Jenkinſon, "tell his honour whether you know any thing of me."—"I can't ſay," replied the butler, "that I know much good of you. The night that gentleman's daughter was deluded to our houſe, you were one of them,—"So then," cried Sir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam, "I find you have brought a very fine witneſs to prove your innocence: thou ſtain to humanity! to aſſociate with ſuch wretches!" (But continuing his examination) "You tell me, Mr. Butler, that this
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:012405_0166_0F897357318FE1A8"/>
was the perſon who brought him this old gentleman's daughter,"—"No, pleaſe your honour," replied the butler, "he did not bring her, for the 'ſquire himſelf undertock that buſineſs; but he brought the prieſt that pretended to marry them."—"It is but too true," cried Jenkinſon, "I cannot deny it, that was the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment aſſigned me, and I confeſs it to my confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion."</p>
                     <p>"Good heavens!" exclaimed the baronet, "how every new diſcovery of his villainy alarms me. All his guilt is now too plain, and I find his preſent proſecution was dictated by tyranny, cowardice and revenge; at my requeſt, Mr. Gaoler, ſet this young officer, now your priſoner, free, and truſt to me for the conſequences.— I'll make it my buſineſs to ſet the affair in a proper light to my friend the magiſtrate who has committed him. But where is the unfortunate young lady herſelf: let her appear to confront this wretch, I long to know by what arts he has ſeduced her honour. Entreat her to come in. Where is ſhe?"</p>
                     <p>"Ah, Sir," ſaid I, "that queſtion ſtings me to the heart: I was once indeed happy in a daughter, but her miſeries."—Another interruption here prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me; for who ſhould make her appearance but Miſs Arabella Wilmot, who was next day to have been mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to Mr. Thornhill. Nothing could equal her ſurprize at ſeeing Sir William and his nephew here before her; for her arrival was quite accidental. It happened that ſhe and the old gentleman her father were paſſing through the town, on their way to her aunt's, who had inſiſted that her nuptials with Mr. Thornhill ſhould be conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated at her houſe; but ſtopping for refreſhment, they put up at an inn at the other end of the town. It was there from the window that the young lady happened to obſerve one of my little boys playing in the ſtreet, and inſtantly ſending a footman to bring the child to her, ſhe learnt from him ſome account of our miſfortunes; but was ſtill kept ignorant of young Mr. Thornhill's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cauſe. Though her father made ſeveral remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances on the impropriety of going to a priſon to viſit us, yet they were ineffectual; ſhe deſired the child to
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:012405_0167_0F897357F29E6790"/>
conduct her, which he did, and it was thus ſhe ſurpriſed us at a juncture ſo unexpected.</p>
                     <p>Nor can I go on, without a reflection on thoſe acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental meetings, which, though they happen every day, ſeldom excite our ſurprize but upon ſome extraordinary occaſion. To what a fortuitous concurrence do we not owe every pleaſure and convenience of our lives. How many ſeemiag accidents muſt unite before we can be cloathed or fed. The peaſant muſt be diſpoſed to labour, the ſhower muſt fall, the wind fill the merchant's fail, or numbers muſt want the uſual ſupply.</p>
                     <p>We all continued ſilent for ſome moments, while my charming pupil, which was the name I generally gave this young lady, united in her looks compaſſion and aſtoniſhment, which gave new finiſhings to her beauty. "Indeed, my dear Mr. Thornhill," cried ſhe to the 'ſquire, who ſhe ſuppoſed was come here to ſuccour and not to oppreſs us; "I take it a little unkindly that you ſhould come here without me, or never inform me of the ſituation of a family ſo dear to us both; you know I ſhould take as much pleaſure in contributing to the relief of my reverend old maſter here, whom I ſhall ever eſteem, as you can. But I find that, like your uncle, you take a pleaſure in doing good in ſecret."</p>
                     <p>"He find pleaſure in doing good!" cried Sir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam, interrupting her. "No, my dear, his pleaſures are as baſe as he is.—You ſee in him, madam, as complete a villain as ever diſgraced humanity. A wretch, who after having deluded this poor man's daughter, after plotting againſt the innocence of her ſiſter, has thrown the father into priſon, and the eldeſt ſon into fetters, becauſe he had courage to face his betrayer.— And give me leave, madam, now to congratulate you upon an eſcape from the embraces of ſuch a monſter."</p>
                     <p>"O goodneſs," cried the lovely girl, "how have I been deceived! Mr. Thornhill informed me for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that this gentleman's eldeſt ſon, Captain Primroſe, was gone off to America with his new-married lady."</p>
                     <p>"My ſweeteſt miſs," cried my wife, "he has told you nothing but falſehoods. My ſon George never left the kingdom, nor ever was married. Tho' you
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:012405_0168_0F897358B42AB4B0"/>
have forſaken him, he has always loved you too well to think of any body elſe; and I have heard him ſay "he would die a batchelor for your ſake." She then proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to expatiate upon the ſncerity of her ſon's paſſion, ſhe ſet his duel with Mr. Thornhill in a proper light, from thence ſhe made a rapid digreſſion to the 'ſquire's debaucheries, his pretended marriages, and ended with a moſt inſulting picture of his cowardice.</p>
                     <p>"Good heavens!" cried Miſs Wilmot, how very "near have I been to the brink of ruin! But how great is my pleaſure to have eſcaped it! Ten thouſand falſehoods has this gentleman told me! He had at laſt art enough to perſuade me that my promiſe to the only man I eſteemed was no longer binding, ſince he had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful. By his falſehoods I was taught to deteſt one equally brave and generous!"</p>
                     <p>But by this time my ſon was freed from the incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances of juſtice. Mr. Jenkinſon alſo, who had acted as his valet de chambre, had dreſſed up his hair, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed him with whatever was neceſſary to make a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teel appearance. He now therefore entered, handſomely dreſt in his regimentals, and without vanity, (for I am above it) he appeared as handſome a fellow as ever wore a military dreſs. As he entered, he made Miſs Wilmot a modeſt and diſtant bow, for he was not as yet acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the change which the eloquence of his mother had wrought in his favour. But no decorums could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the impatience of his bluſhing miſtreſs to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given. Her tears, her looks, all contributed to diſcover the real ſenſations of her heart for having forgotten her former promiſe, and having ſuffered herſelf to be delud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an impoſtor. My ſon appeared amazed at her condeſcenſion, and could ſcarce believe it real.—"Sure, madam," cried he, "this is but deluſion! I can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have merited this! To be bleſt thus is to be too happy."—No, Sir, replied ſhe, "I have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, baſely deceived, elſe nothing could have ever made me unjuſt to my promiſe. You know my friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, you have long known it; but forget what I have done, and as you once had my warmeſt vows of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, you ſhall now have them repeated; and be aſſured that if your Arabella cannot be yours, ſhe ſhall
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:012405_0169_0F89735971AD73F8"/>
never be another's."—"And no other's you ſhall be," cried Sir William, "if I have any influence with your father."</p>
                     <p>This hint was ſufficient for my ſon Moſes, who imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately flew to the inn where the old gentleman was, to inform him of every circumſtance that had happened. But in the mean time the 'ſquire perceiving that he was on every ſide undone, now finding that no hopes were left from flattery and diſſimulation, concluded that his wiſeſt way would be to turn and face his purſuers. Thus laying aſide all ſhame, he appeared the open hardy vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain. "I find then," cried he, "that I am to expect no juſtice here; but I am reſolved it ſhall be done me.— "You ſhall know, Sir," turning to Sir William, "I am no longer a power depending upon your favours. I ſcorn them. Nothing can keep Miſs Wilmot's fortune from me, which, I thank her father's aſſiduity, is pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty large. The articles, and a bond for her fortune, are ſigned, and ſafe in my poſſeſſion. It was her fortune, not her perſon, that induced me to wiſh for this match, and poſſeſſed of the one, let who will take the other."</p>
                     <p>This was an alarming blow, Sir William was ſenſible of the juſtice of his claims, for he had been inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal in drawing up the marriage articles himſelf. Miſs Wilmot therefore perceiving that her fortune was irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trievably loſt, turning to my ſon, ſhe aſked if the loſs of fortune could leſſen her value to him. "Though for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune." ſaid ſhe, "is out of my power, at leaſt I have my hand to give."</p>
                     <p>"And that, madam," cried her real lover, was indeed "all that you ever had to give; at leaſt all that I ever thought worth the acceptance. And I now proteſt, my Arabella by all that's happy, your want of fortune this moment encreaſes my pleaſure, as it ſerves to convince my ſweet girl of my ſincerity."</p>
                     <p>Mr. Wilmot now entering, he ſeemed not a little pleaſed at the danger his daughter had juſt eſcaped, and readily conſented to a diſſolution of the match. But finding that her fortune, which was ſecured to Mr. Thornhill by bond, would not be given up, nothing could exceed his diſappointment. He now ſaw that his
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:012405_0170_0F89735A33372138"/>
money muſt all go to enrich one who had no fortune of his own. He could bear his being a raſcal; but to want an equivalent to his daughter's fortune was wormwood. He ſat therefore for ſome minutes employed in the moſt mortifying ſpeculations till Sir William attempted to leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen his anxiety.—"I muſt confeſs, Sir," cried he, "that your preſent diſappointment does not entirely diſpleaſe me. Your immoderate paſſion for wealth is now juſtly puniſhed. But tho' the young lady cannot be rich, ſhe has ſtill a competence ſufficient to give content. Here you ſee an honeſt young ſoldier, who is willing to take her without fortune; they have long loved each other, and for the friendſhip I bear his father, my intereſt ſhall not be wanting for his promotion. Leave then that ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which diſappoints you, and for once admit happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which courts your acceptance"</p>
                     <p>"Sir William," replied the old gentleman, "be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured I never yet forced her inclinations, nor will I now. If ſhe ſtill continues to love this young gentleman, let her have him with all my heart. There is ſtill, thank heaven, ſome fortune left, and your promiſe will make it ſomething more. Only let my old friend here (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me) give me a promiſe of ſettling ſix thouſand pounds upon my girl, if ever he ſhould come to his fortune, and I am ready this night to be the firſt to join them together."</p>
                     <p>As it now remained with me to make the young cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple happy, I readily gave a promiſe of making the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement he required, which to one who had ſuch little expectations as I, was no great favour — We had now therefore the ſatisfaction of ſeeing them fly into each other's arms in a tranſport. "After all my misfortunes." cried my ſon George, "to be thus rewarded! Sure this is more than I could ever have preſumed to hope for.— To be poſſeſſed of all that's good, and after ſuch an interval of pain! My warmeſt wiſhes could never riſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o high!"—"Yes, my George," returned his lovely bride, now let the wretch take my fortune; ſince you are happy without it, ſo am I. O what an exchange have I made from the baſeſt of men to the deareſt, beſt.—Let him enjoy our fortune, I now can
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:012405_0171_0F89735AF2BF6CB0"/>
be happy even in indigence."—"And I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe you," cried the 'ſquire, with a malicious grin, "that I ſhall be very happy with what you deſpiſe." —Hold, hold, Sir," cried Jenkinſon, "there are two words to that bargain.—As for that lady's fortune, Sir, you ſhall never touch a ſingle ſtiver of it. Pray your honour," continued he to Sir William, "can the 'ſquire have this lady's fortune if he be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to another?"—"How can you make ſuch a ſimple demand," replied the baronet, "undoubtedly he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not."—"I am ſorry for that," cried Jenkinſon; for as this gentleman and I have been old fellow ſporters, I have a friendſhip for him. But I muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, well as I love him, that his contract is not worth a tobacco ſtopper, for he is married already." "—You lie like a raſcal," returned the 'ſquire, who ſeemed rouzed by this inſult, "I never was legally married to any woman."—"Indeed, begging your honour's pardon," replied the other, "you were; and I hope you will ſhew a proper return of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to your own honeſt Jenkinſon, who brings you a wife, and if the company reſtrain their curioſity a few minutes, they ſhall ſee her."—So ſaying he went off with his uſual celerity, and left us all unable to form any probable conjecture as to his deſign.—"Ay let him go," cried the 'ſquire, "whatever elſe I may have done I defy him there. I am too old now to be frightened with 'ſquibs."</p>
                     <p>"I am ſurpriſed," ſaid the baronet, "what the fellow can intend by this. Some low piece of humour I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe!—"Perhaps, Sir," replied I, "he may have a more ſerious meaning.—For when we reflect on the various ſchemes this gentleman laid to ſeduce inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, perhaps ſome one, more artful than the reſt, has been found able to deceive him. When we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what numbers he has ruined, how many parents now feel with anguiſh the infamy and the contamina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which he has brought into their families, it would not ſurpriſe me if ſome one of them.—Amazement! Do I ſee my loſt daughter! Do I hold her! It is, it is my life, my happineſs. I thought thee loſt, my Olivia, yet ſtill I hold thee—and ſtill ſhalt thou live

to bleſs me."—The warmeſt tranſports of the fondeſt lover were not greater than mine when I ſaw him intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce my child, and held my daughter in my arms, whoſe ſilence only ſpoke her raptures. "And art thou return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me, my darling," cried I, "to be my comfort in age!"—"That ſhe is," cried Jenkinſon, "and make much of her, for ſhe is your own honourable child, and as honeſt a woman as any in the whole room, let the other be who ſhe will. And as for you, 'ſquire, as ſure as you ſtand there, this young lady is your lawful wedded wife. And to convince you that I ſpeak no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but truth, here is the licence by which you were married together."—So ſaying, he put the licence into the baronet's hands, who read it, and found it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in every reſpect. "And now, gentlemen," con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he, "I find you are ſurpriſed at all this; but a few words will explain the difficulty. That there 'ſquire of renown, for whom I have a great friendſhip, but that's between ourſelves, has often employed me in doing odd little things for him. Among the reſt he commiſſioned me to procure him a falſe licence and a falſe prieſt, in order to deceive this young lady. But as I was very much his friend, what did I do but I went and got a true licence and a true prieſt, and married them both as faſt as the cloth could make them. Perhaps you'd think it was generoſity that made me do all this. But no. To my ſhame I confeſs it, my only deſign was to keep the licence, and let the 'ſquire know that I could prove it upon him whenever I thought proper, and ſo make him come down whenever I wanted money." A burſt of pleaſure now ſeemed to fill the whole apartment; our joy reached even to the common room, where the priſoners themſelves ſympathized,
<q>

                        </gap>s expanded upon every face, and even Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via's cheek ſeemed fluſhed with pleaſure. To be thus reſtored to reputation, to friends and fortune at once was a rapture ſufficient to ſtop the progreſs of decay
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:012405_0173_0F89735D38B889D0"/>
and reſtore former health and vivacity. But perhaps among all there was not one who felt ſincerer pleaſure than I. Still holding the dear-loved child in my arms, I aſked my heart if theſe tranſports were not deluſion. "How could you," cried I turning to Mr. Jenkinſon, "how could you add to my miſeries by the ſtory of her death! But it matters not, my pleaſure at finding her again, is more than a recompence for the pain."</p>
                     <p>"As to your queſtion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>" replied Jenkinſon, "that is eaſily anſwered. I thought the only probable means of freeing you from priſon, was by ſubmitting to the 'ſquire, and conſenting to his marriage with the other young lady. But there you had vowed never to grant while your daughter was living: there was therefore no other method to bring things to bear but by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuading you that ſhe was dead. I prevailed on your wife to join in the deceit, and we have not had a fit opportunity of undeceiving you till now."</p>
                     <p>In the whole aſſembly now there only appeared two faces that did not glow with tranſport. Mr. Thornhill's aſſurance had entirely forſaken him: he now ſaw the g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He therefore fell on his knees before his uncle, and in a voice of piercing miſery implored compaſſion. Sir William was going to ſpurn him away, but at my requeſt be raiſed him, and after pauſing a few moments. "Thy vices, crimes, and ingratitude," cried he, "deſerves no tenderneſs; yet thou ſhalt not be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely forſaken, a bare competence ſhall be ſupplied, to ſupport the wants of life, but not its follies.

                     <p>His example was followed by Miſs Wilmot and her father; my wife too kiſſed her daughter with much affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as, to uſe her own expreſſion, ſhe was now made an honeſt woman of. Sophia and Moſes followed in turn, and even our benefactor Jenkinſon deſired to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to that honour. Our ſatisfaction ſeemed ſcarce capable of increaſe. Sir William, whoſe greateſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure was in doing good, now looked round with a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance open as the ſun, and ſaw nothing but joy in the looks of all except that of my daughter Sophia, who, for ſome reaſons we could not comprehend, did not ſeem perfectly ſatisfied. "I think now," cried he, with a ſmile, "that all the company, except one or two, ſeem perfectly happy. There only remains an act of juſtice for me to do. You are ſenſible, Sir," continued he, turning to me, "of the obligations we both owe Mr. Jenkinſon for his late aſſiduity in detecting a ſcoundrel. It is but juſt we ſhould both reward him for it.— Your youngeſt daughter Miſs Sophia, will, I am ſure, make him very happy, and he ſhall have from me five hundred pounds as her fortune, and upon this I am ſure they can live very comfortably together. Come, Miſs Sophia, what ſay you to this match of my making? Will you have him?"—My poor girl ſeemed almoſt ſinking into her mother's arms at the hideous propoſal.— "Have him, Sir!" cried ſhe faintly. "No, Sir, never." "What." cried he again, "not have Mr. Jenkinſon, your benefactor, an handſome young fellow, with five hundred pounds and good expectations!"—"I beg, Sir," returned ſhe, ſcarce able to ſpeak, "that you'll deſiſt, and not make me ſo very wretched."—"Was ever ſuch obſtinacy known." cried he again, "to refuſe a man whom the family has ſuch infinite obligations to, who preſerved your ſiſter. What, not have him!"— "No, Sir, never," replied ſhe angrily, "I'd ſoon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>dour. "My lovelieſt, my moſt ſenſible of girls." cried he, "how could you ever think your own Burchell could

deceive you, or that Sir William Thornhill could ever ceaſe to admire a miſtreſs that loved him for himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone? I have for ſome years ſought for a woman, who, a ſtranger to my fortune, could think that I had merit as a man. After having tried in vain, even amongſt the pert and ugly, how great at laſt muſt be my rapture to have made a conqueſt over ſuch ſenſe and ſuch heavenly beauty!" Then turning to Jenkinſon, "As I cannot, Sir, part with this young lady myſelf, for ſhe has taken a fancy to the cut of my face, all the recompence I can make is to give you her fortune; and you may call upon my ſteward to-morrow for five hundred pounds." Thus we had all our compliments to repeat, and Lady Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill underwent the ſame round of ceremony that her ſiſter had done before. In the mean time Sir William's gentleman appeared to tell us that the equipages were ready to carry us to the inn, where every thing was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for our reception. My wife and I led the van, and left thoſe gloomy manſions of ſorrow. The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Baronet ordered forty pounds to be diſtributed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the priſoners, and Mr. Wilmot, induced by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, gave half that ſum. We were received below by the ſhouts of the villagers, and I ſaw and ſhook by the hand two or three of my honeſt pariſhioners, who were among the number. They attended us to our inn, where a ſumptuous entertainment was provided<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and coarſer proviſions diſtributed in great quantities among the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulace.</p>
                     <p>After ſupper, as my ſpirits were exhauſted by the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of pleaſure and pain which they had ſuſtained during the day, I aſked permiſſion to withdraw, and leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the company in the midſt of their mirth, as ſoon as I found myſelf alone, I poured out my heart in gratitude to the giver of joy as well as of ſorrow, and then ſlept undiſturbed till morning.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XIII. The Concluſion.</head>
                     <p>THE next morning as ſoon as I awakened, I found my eldeſt ſon ſitting by my bed-ſide, who came to encreaſe my joy with another turn of fortune in my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. Firſt having releaſed me from the ſettlement that I had made the day before in his favour, he let me know that my merchant who had failed in town was arreſted at Antwerp, and there had given up effects to a much greater amount than what was due to his creditors. My boy's generoſity pleaſed me almoſt as much as this unlooked for good fortune. But I had ſome doubts whether I ought in juſtice to accept his offer. While I was pondering upon this, ſir Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am entered the room, to whom I communicated my doubts. His opinion was, that as my ſon was already poſſeſſed of a very affluent fortune by his marriage, I might accept his offer without any heſitation. His buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, however, was to inform me, that as he had the night before ſent for the licences, and expected them every hour, he hoped that I would not refuſe my aſſiſtance in making all the company happy that morning. A foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man entered while we were ſpeaking, to tell us that the meſſenger was returned, and as I was by this time ready, I went down, where I found the whole company as mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as affluence and innocence could make them. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, as they were now preparing for a very ſolemn ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, their laughter entirely diſpleaſed me. I told them of the grave, becoming and ſublime deportment they ſhould aſſume upon this myſtical occaſion, and read them two homilies and a theſis of my own compoſition, in order to prepare them. Yet they ſtill ſeemed perfectly refractory and ungovernable. Even as we were going along to church, to which I led the way, all gravity had quite forſaken them, and I was often tempted to turn back in indignation. In church a new dilemma aroſe, which promiſed no eaſy ſolution. This was, which couple ſhould be married firſt; my ſon's bride warmly inſiſted, That lady Thornhill (that was to be) ſhould
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:012405_0177_0F897360325377F8"/>
take the lead; but this the other refuſed with equal ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, proteſting ſhe would not be guilty of ſuch rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for the world. The argument was ſupported for ſome time between both with equal obſtinacy and good breeding. But as I ſtood all this time with my book ready, I was at laſt quite tired of the conteſt, and ſhutting it, "I perceive," cried I, "that none of you have a mind to be married, and I think we had as good go back again; for I ſuppoſe there will be no buſineſs done here to-day."—This at once reduced them to reaſon. The Baronet and his Lady were firſt married, and then my ſon and his lovely partner.</p>
                     <p>I had previouſly that morning given orders that a coach ſhould be ſent for my honeſt neighbour Flamborough and his family, by which means, upon our return to the inn, we had the pleaſure of finding the two Miſs Flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boroughs alighted before us. Mr. Jenkinſon gave his hand to the eldeſt, and my ſon Moſes led up the other: (and I have ſince found that he has taken a real liking to the girl, and my conſent and bounty he ſhall have whenever he thinks proper to demand them.) We were no ſooner returned to the inn, but numbers of my pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioners, hearing of my ſucceſs, came to congratulate me, but among the reſt were thoſe who roſe to reſcue me, and whom I formerly rebuked with ſuch ſharpneſs. I told the ſtory to Sir William, my ſon-in-law, who went out and reproved them with great ſeverity; but finding them quite diſheartened by his harſh reproof, he gave them half a guinea a-piece to drink his health, and raiſe their dejected ſpirits.</p>
                     <p>Soon after this we were called to a very genteel enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taiment, which was dreſt by Mr. Thornhill's cook. And it may not be improper to obſerve with reſpect to that gentleman, that he now reſides in quality of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion at a relation's houſe, being very well liked and ſeldom ſitting at the ſide-table, except when there is no room at the other; for they make no ſtranger of him. His time is pretty much taken up in keeping his relation, who is a little melancholy, in ſpirits, and in learning to blow the French-horn. My eldeſt daughter, however, ſtill remembers him with regret; and ſhe has even told me, though I make a great ſecret of it, that when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:012405_0178_0F897360F80C5F98"/>
ſhe may be brought to relent. But to return, for I am not apt to digreſs thus; when we were to ſit down to dinner our ceremonies were going to be renewed. The queſtion was whether my eldeſt daughter, as being a matron, ſhould not ſit above the two young brides, but the debate was cut ſhort by my ſon George, who propoſed, that the company ſhould ſit indiſcriminately, every gentleman by his lady. This was received with great approbation by all, excepting my wife, who I could perceive was not perfectly ſatisfied, as ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to have had the pleaſure of ſitting at the head of the table and carving all the meat for all the company. But notwithſtanding this, it is impoſſible to deſcribe our good humour. I can't ſay whether we had more wit amongſt us now than uſual; but I am certain we had more laughing, which anſwered the end as well. One jeſt I particularly remember, old Mr. Wilmot drinking to Moſes, whoſe head was turned another way, my ſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, "Madam, I thank you." Upon which the old gentleman, winking upon the reſt of the company, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that he was thinking of his miſtreſs. At which jeſt I thought the two Miſs Flamboroughs would have died with laughing. As ſoon as dinner was over, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my old cuſtom, I requeſted that the table might be taken away, to have the pleaſure of ſeeing all my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily aſſembled once more by a chearful fire-ſide. My two little ones ſat upon each knee, the reſt of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny by their partners. I had nothing now on this ſide of the grave to wiſh for, all my cares were over, my pleaſure was unſpeakable. It now only remained that my gratitude in good fortune ſhould exceed my former ſubmiſſion in adverſity.</p>
