            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<stage>(<hi>Walks in agitation</hi>)</stage>
I ſee now the whole affair. Peeviſh has become jealous of his wife, without juſt cauſe, I am ſure. He, in order to come at her ſuppoſed inconſtancy, has affected to proſecute a journey, but in fact has remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in town, and aſſumed the dreſs of a woman, lurked about the houſe, to be a ready ſpy upon the actions of his lady.
<stage>(<hi>pauſes</hi>)</stage>
How am I to act in this affair? I muſt write a penitent letter to Mrs. Peeviſh; but what the devil ſhall I ſay to Peeviſh? I will go and beg his pardon for the diſhonor intended him. If he ſhould require other ſatisfaction, I ſhall be rendered extremely unhappy, though not afraid to meet him; yet as I have been the aggreſſor, it would be adding injury to inſult. Peeviſh is a man of underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, though of a fretful temper. I hope he will be ſatisfied with due conceſſions, and the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be huſhed: thus I go on ſinning and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, repenting and ſinning.

I parried him with a ſmall cane-ſword I had, till it broke into twenty pieces—then I was obliged to retreat; and if I had not been as nimble as a monkey, he would have pinked me. I ran— he purſued; I ſlipped into a ſlop-ſhop, threw off my hat and fine coat; put on this ſailor's jacket and cap, and puſhed out of a front-ſtreet door; by that means evaded the bloody rogue.</p>

I hope your union will produce men as brave as the father, and women as beautiful as the mother. Have you heard the news, gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men? There is news arrived, that the people to the weſtward, are in arms againſt the laws of government. We are all to turn out: I expect to have the command of a regiment.</p>

for them to legiſlate, if this fundamental prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple is not ſacredly adhered to:—that, what the majority determine upon, ſhall be the law of the land.

Now I am a fine gantleman, I am led to think a little dape. Upon my honeſty, I think it is a comical quare world we are oblaged to live in.

                     <p>You make the very worſt of every thing, brother. Remember the old ſaying: all is not loſt which is in danger. You view every thing on the dark ſide. Now, let me take a look at the light ſide. It is true, you have been deceived in your younger ſon; but with prudent management, he may live to be a comfort to you. Your daughter, make the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry worſt of it, has only taken a jump over the pales of your church, and married a man who is an honour to his country, and I am ſure, will make her happy. As for George, depend upon it, he will not eventually diſgrace you, or diſhonour me. Come, let us go to reſt. Keep up your ſpirits, and hope for the beſt.</p>

                     <p>My dear George, you are now arrived at that time of life, which ſhould teach you to ſet a juſt value upon time. You know I have never been a ſpy upon your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; nor never wiſh to croſs you in rational

pleaſures. I have heard of ſome of your exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which has given me uneaſineſs. Depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, too conſtant a repetition of thoſe mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night revels, will neither promote your health, nor eſtabliſh you a fair reputation in the world. To be ſerious with you, George, I wiſh you to enter into the banns of wedlock. Caſt your eyes around you. Single out ſome lady, whom you may think worthy of your affection. It mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not, whether ſhe has wealth, provided ſhe has merit. For my part, I would rather have you form a connection with a woman of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate ſhare of beauty, with good ſenſe, and an amiable diſpoſition, if ſhe had not a ſecond change, than to one that would bring you thouſands, and lead you a termagant life.</p>

By my ſhoul, I never wiſhed to be rich before.—I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did like kaping company with thoſe four-footed baſtes: beſides, it is a devil of a hard life. One is oblaged to turn out in the ſnow and cold at very unſhaſonably hours, and there is no grate dale got by it after all. One may be riding about the whole yare, and at the end of it, be juſt where they walked off from, without a farthing the better. Now, I think, if I had about three, or two hundred dollars, I could ſhut up a grate ſtore; and it appares clare to me, I could make a grate dale of money. Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tells me, that many of my countrymen came here very poor, and have made grate fortunes out of nothing at all at all; and with the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of heaven, Pat will do it too.
