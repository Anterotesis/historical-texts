            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In the opinion of the author, ſuch like
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:027120_0004_0FD34B86D1090DB0"/>
hiſtories, ſo far from being beneficial to children, are either quite beyond their underſtanding, and therefore capable of affording no entertainment to them; or elſe, tend only to inſpire their ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der minds with Pride, Ambition, Vanity, and every paſſion diſgraceful to human nature.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>The following little book was written with a view to amuſe and inſtruct one particular family, in whoſe welfare the author is nearly concerned; but if it ſhould be diſtributed into the hands of other children, they may, perhaps, be equally entertained with reading the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of ſo many little boys and girls; who, by boys and girls, will always be thought the moſt important part of the ſpecies.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>BETSY</hi> and <hi>Mary Higgins</hi> were two little girls. <hi>Betſy</hi> was ſix years old, and <hi>Mary</hi> a little more than four. In com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon they were both very good, but ſometimes <hi>Mary</hi> uſed to be a little heedleſs, and not mind when firſt ſhe was ſpoken to; which was very ſilly, and made
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:027120_0006_0FD34B8964F3AFB0"/>
               <figure/>
people not love her ſo well as they otherwiſe would have done. One day her Mamma lent her a fan, that ſhe might look at the pictures which
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:027120_0007_0FD34B8C567CF928"/>
were on it; with a caution to take care of, and not break it. But ſhe did not mind what was ſaid to her, and after ſhe had done looking at it, began to ſweep the room with it, calling it in play, A nice broom. Her Mamma called to <hi>Mary,</hi> Do not do ſo, <hi>Mary!</hi> do not do ſo! you will break it, and if you do I ſhall be very angry with you! But <hi>Mary</hi> did not mind, and went on ſweeping the room till
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:027120_0008_0FD34B8D81D8EA68"/>
ſhe tore the fan all to pieces, and it could be uſed no more.
<figure/>
So her Mamma was obliged to get up to her, ſhake her a great
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:027120_0009_0FD34BAE4C99E420"/>
deal, and put her into the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner for being ſo naughty as not to mind what was ſaid to her. How ſilly it was! for if ſhe had minded when her Mamma firſt bade her leave off ſweep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the room, ſhe would have been a good girl, and not have made her Mamma angry; and might have ſeen the fan an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other time, and all the pretty pictures which were upon it.</p>
            <p>Now you ſhall hear about

               <figure/>
Miſs <hi>Betſy Higgins.</hi> She was a very good girl indeed, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways did as ſhe was deſired, and held up her head ſo very well,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:027120_0011_0FD34BB32CB08188"/>
and turned out her toes, and was ſo clever, and ſo agreeable, that every body was fond of her, and liked to have her come to ſee them, and play with their little boys and girls; for ſhe never ſaid any bad words, nor did any thing that was wrong; and when any body ſpoke to her, ſhe uſed to anſwer ſo prettily, and ſpeak ſo plain, and ſo civilly, that ſhe never forgot to ſay <hi>Madam,</hi> if a
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:027120_0012_0FD34B92100F5BD0"/>
lady ſpoke to her, and <hi>Sir,</hi> if a gentleman; ſo that people uſed to call her <hi>the good Miſs Higgins.</hi> One day a lady who went to

               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:027120_0013_0FD34BB3D3BF7738"/>
ſee her Mamma, knowing what a good girl ſhe was, carried her a new doll, and a little tea-cheſt, for which ſhe made a very pretty courteſy, and ſaid, <hi>I am much obliged to you, Madam.</hi> Then up ſtairs ſhe ran to ſhow it to her ſiſter; for ſhe always took great pains to pleaſe her, and let her play with her toys; and if ſhe had any apples or buns, ſhe gave her ſiſter half of them.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>TOMMY Piper</hi> was five years old, very tall, and a fine boy; but he was ſo fretful and naughty, that nobody liked to ſee him. If he wanted a piece of bread, inſtead of aſking pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, and ſaying, <hi>Pray be ſo good as to give me a bit of bread?</hi> he
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:027120_0015_0FD34BB547274C80"/>
would ſay, <hi>Give me a bit! for I want it! and will have it!</hi> And
<figure/>
if it was not given to him di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, he would cry and ſcream
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:027120_0016_0FD34B9C6188B398"/>
like a pig. One day as Mr. <hi>Makegood</hi> was going by Mr. <hi>Piper'</hi>s houſe, he heard <hi>Tommy</hi> crying, and roaring, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſad noiſe; ſo he ſtopped at the door, to aſk what was the matter? And when he was told that it was maſter <hi>Tommy</hi> cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe he would not be dreſſed; he ſaid, <hi>Let me ſee him, and I will make him good.</hi> So <hi>Tommy</hi> was fetched to him, and came ſcreaming down ſtairs,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:027120_0017_0FD34BB6D116F448"/>
               <figure/>
and ſaying, <hi>I will not be waſhed! I will not be waſhed! That I will not! But I will be dirty! I will be naked!</hi> Will you? ſaid Mr.

               <hi>Makegood,</hi> Do you talk in that way, Maſter <hi>Tommy?</hi> I ſhall try whether I can make you be good. Then he took him up in his arms, carried him into the garden, and threw him into a great tub of water to waſh him. Now, ſaid he, will you ever ſay you will not be waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again? If you do, you ſhall always be thrown into the tub. And then he began to beat him whilſt he was naked, and
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:027120_0019_0FD34BA0D5FBF9B8"/>
ſaid, If you will not be dreſſed,
<figure/>
I ſhall beat you all the time you are without your clothes; for I do not like to ſee naked

children. He had a great rod in his hand, which hurt him ſadly, ſo that he was very glad to ſtand quietly to be dreſſed; and took care never to ſay an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other time, <hi>I will not be dreſſed, and I will be naked.</hi>

not like, for he knew it was very naughty indeed to do what diſpleaſed them, becauſe he was out of their ſight. His Papa and Mamma did not chooſe that he ſhould eat cakes or butter, becauſe it was not good for him, and would make him ſick, and they loved him too well to like that he ſhould be ſick. One day, when he went to ſee Maſter <hi>Puny,</hi> he found him eating cakes, and
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:027120_0030_0FD34BC9C65A05B8"/>
bread and butter. Maſter <hi>Puny</hi> aſked him if he would not eat ſome? but <hi>George</hi> ſaid, No, I thank you! I never eat cakes
<figure/>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:027120_0031_0FD34BC9CB74D898"/>
or butter. I will have a bit of dry bread if you pleaſe. Mrs. <hi>Puny</hi> did not know that his Papa and Mamma did not chooſe that he ſhould eat them, and ſo ſhe too aſked him to eat ſome; and ſaid, Pray, Maſter <hi>George,</hi> eat a bit of cake, I got it on purpoſe for you; and I am ſure a little will not hurt you: It is very good and nice, pray eat ſome. But <hi>George</hi> was too
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:027120_0032_0FD34BCB01E95970"/>
good a boy to do what he knew was wrong. And ſo he very civilly thanked her, and ſaid, Indeed, Madam, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eat any, for my Papa and Mamma deſire I will not eat cakes; and I am ſure I muſt do as they bid me; for they are very kind to me, and take a great deal of care of me, and let me have every thing that is proper for me; and would let me eat cakes if they
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:027120_0033_0FD34BCDA9FFA1F8"/>
thought they would not hurt me; but they ſay that cakes will make me ſick, and I am ſure Papa and Mamma know much better than I do. Well, ſaid Mrs. <hi>Puny,</hi> you are a very good child indeed, and here is an apple and an orange for you; for I dare ſay you may eat them. <hi>George</hi> thanked her, and ſaid, Yes, Madam, I may eat them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ripe fruit: and
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:027120_0034_0FD34BCEC29489A8"/>
ſo he took them, and gave his play-fellow, Maſter <hi>Puny,</hi> ſome of each. When he went home, Mrs. <hi>Puny</hi> ſent word how good he had been. So his Papa and Mamma kiſſed him, and told him they loved him dearly; and the next morning his Papa gave him a little horſe to ride on, which <hi>George</hi> liked better than eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cakes; for he knew they would ſoon be gone; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,

            <head>The Hiſtory of Miſs MARY ANN SELFISH.</head>
            <p>MISS <hi>Mary Ann Selfiſh</hi> would have been a very good and agreeable little girl, if ſhe had not been ſo ſadly greedy of every thing, either to eat or to play with. She had two
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:027120_0037_0FD34BD405D37C50"/>
little ſiſters, who were very good girls, and ſhe ſaid, that ſhe loved them dearly: But if you had ſeen her when ſhe

               <pb n="42" facs="unknown:027120_0038_0FD34BD864C930C8"/>
was eating a bun or an apple, you would have thought ſhe did not love them at all: for ſhe did not like to give them a bit; but choſe to eat all herſelf; and filled her mouth ſo frightfully full, you cannot think how ugly ſhe looked. Her ſiſters were very good-humoured, and always liked to give her ſome of every thing they had: but <hi>Mary Ann</hi> was never contented, but after
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:027120_0039_0FD34BDB835F0D68"/>
ſhe had eaten a great deal of pudding, or a whole orange, or apple, ſhe wanted ſome of

her ſiſters, and uſed to go and ſtand by one of them, and aſk for more. Her Mamma and all her friends often told her not to do ſo; but ſhe did not mind them, but ſtill want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every thing that ſhe ſaw any body elſe have, juſt like a little hog. So her Mamma one day took hold of her hand, and ſaid, <hi>Mary Ann!</hi> if you will be ſo like a hog, you ſhall go and live with the pigs,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:027120_0041_0FD34BE03705B568"/>
and not with me and your ſiſters; for you will teach them to be as bad as yourſelf. Come, I will carry you to the pigs now, and then you may eat together as faſt and as much as you pleaſe. <hi>Mary Ann</hi> began to cry! her Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma did not mind that, but carried her out, and put her to the pig-ſty with the hogs. What a ſad thing that was for a little girl to live among the

So when her Mamma heard that ſhe had told ſuch a ſtory about the cake that was given her, ſhe took it all from her, and whipped her very hard indeed, and turned her out of the houſe; for ſhe

did not like to have ſuch naughty girls in the room with

without any body taking any notice of her, or giving her any victuals to eat, or any thing to drink. And ſo all little boys and girls muſt be ſerved who tell fibs.</p>
