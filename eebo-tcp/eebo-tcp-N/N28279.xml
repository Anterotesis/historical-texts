            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <l>Expect the fruit, when more matur'd by age.</l>

                  <l>When barren trunks, are doubtful, yes, or no.</l>
                  <l>Then <hi>live</hi> my friends, your thriving blossoms send;</l>
                  <l>Each small defect, as criticks, <hi>nicely</hi> mend.</l>

                  <l>As youth in trifles often take delight;</l>
                  <l>Perhaps the work will <hi>some,</hi> to read invite;</l>

And beggard me, alas! no house, no home,</l>
                  <l>Upon a pilgrimage I wish'd to roam—</l>
                  <l>Left father, friends, and bade the world adieu</l>
                  <l>For many years, 'till time work'd something new.</l>
                  <l>One ev'ning, standing at my wicket gate,</l>
                  <l>I saw a sail, in which I tried my fate;</l>
                  <l>Some herbs and fossils, all my worldly store,</l>
                  <l>To pay my passage; thus I left the shore</l>
                  <l>Unknown to all, myself I did conceal,</l>
                  <l>Afraid misfortune should my name reveal."</l>
                  <l>While painting thus, his life's past motley scene,</l>
                  <l>A youth was introduc'd of graceful mein,</l>
                  <l>Whose humble manners seem'd for him to plead,</l>
                  <l>His eyes look'd round impatient to succeed;</l>
                  <l>And when recogniz'd, prov'd the very one,</l>
                  <l>Who just before had made the man his fun.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="28" facs="unknown:037693_0028_100F2662F945C9F8"/>
The youth broke silence by a strong desire,</l>
                  <l>That he would straight attend him to his sire.</l>
                  <l>They both agreed, and cheerfully withdrew,</l>
                  <l>Walk'd on their way, and more conversant grew;</l>
                  <l>'Till by degrees his former dwelling rose</l>
                  <l>Burst on his view and more familiar grows.</l>
                  <l>Wild with amaze, his rapid thoughts ran o'er</l>
                  <l>His youthful days, so gaily spent before;</l>
                  <l>And thinks, could time his course roll o'er again,</l>
                  <l>How easy he should all his vice restrain.</l>
                  <l>Thus lost in thought, some minutes wing'd their flight</l>
                  <l>And would have held him till approaching night;</l>
                  <l>Had not the noisy door, with hinges strong,</l>
                  <l>Opened wide to hasten them along:</l>

                     <pb n="29" facs="unknown:037693_0029_100F266597F31A80"/>
When, suddenly, the anxious servant spoke,</l>
                  <l>Who thus aloud his pensive silence broke:</l>
                  <l>Walk in my friend, you'r welcome here,</l>
                  <l>My master greets you with a heart sincere—</l>
                  <l>Upstairs they went, the sick man heard their feet,</l>
                  <l>And rais'd his head, their eager eyes to meet:</l>
                  <l>He cried, "if in this world a taste of heav'n we know,</l>
                  <l>It does indeed from all good actions flow;</l>
                  <l>Majestic innocence is pleasure still,</l>
                  <l>And actual good, will always conquer ill.</l>
                  <l>'Twas I, alas! who laid the wicked plan,</l>
                  <l>To cheat you of your right, as honest man;</l>
                  <l>I turn'd the fatal die, and won the game,</l>
                  <l>While honor press'd you to give up the same:</l>

Despair and sorrow seiz'd your frenzi'd mind,</l>
                  <l>And wand'ring, sought in wilds a home to find—</l>
                  <l>Just Heav'n exacting penance, sickness sent,</l>
                  <l>And torments, direful too, I underwent.</l>
                  <l>If aught for evil done can e'er requite,</l>
                  <l>In remnant life, I'll do the thing that's right—</l>
                  <l>Into your care these writings back I give,</l>
                  <l>And do resign the place on which I live;</l>
                  <l>I ask your pardon, and when health permit</l>
                  <l>Will for my own, this spacious mansion quit."</l>
                  <l>The man in tears, receiv'd his heritage;</l>
                  <l>And each contented, liv'd to good old age.</l>

                  <l>Dread winter reigns in darkness, frost and snow;</l>
                  <l>Primeval gloom, her sable mantle's spread,</l>
                  <l>Mourns the lost day, and vegetation dead.</l>
                  <l>By winter thus, in wild confusion thrown,</l>

And naked forests shake their ruthful heads,</l>
