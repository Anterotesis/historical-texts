            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

A chapel, built on the ſummit, is its principal edifice; thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did the hearts of its humble inhabitants repair to invoke the mercy of their Creator, and oft did they implore him to protect ſuch of their friends and relations as were expoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the boiſterous element below it. Nor was this the only purpoſe to which this ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple building was adapted; frequently did its white front borrow aid from the moon, and

ſerved as a land mark to the diſtreſſed marin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who were driven within its view.</p>
               <p>This village, which I ſhall call Birtland, might have been juſtly deſcribed as ſecluded from the world. No proud lord uſurped its happy domain. No legal plunderer attended to ſettle thoſe trifling differences between man and man, which, without ſuch interference, might be ſoon adjuſted; but which, when ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, frequently proves worſe than the evil. At Birtland, the age of primitive innocence ſtill exiſted; at Birtland, all was union and perfect tranquillity.</p>
               <p>Within two miles of this happy village ſtood an ancient caſtle, formerly the reſidence of the houſe of Haſtings. Many were the illuſtrious Earls of Huntingdon who had drawn their firſt and laſt breath of life within its then peaceful <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

They were as remarkable for their benevolence and hoſpitality, as the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of the preſent age are for their arrogance and boundleſs ambition. At THEIR door, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was the tale of woe rejected, nor did a petitioner crave in vain. The wealthy and the indigent were equally unknown; and the hearts and purſes of theſe noble lords were ever open to the tears of the unhappy. To obtain their protection, it was neceſſary only to ſolicit it; for no guileful wanderer ever bent his way to the happy but retired caſtle of Led<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="unknown:030497_0004_0FE6F5464B025818"/>Many centuries had paſſed in this ſtate of bliſs, when time, which is ever working miracles, (hitherto fatal to mankind!) ſtretched the cloud of fate over this humble corner of England. The <hi>laſt</hi> Earl of Huntingdon <hi>died.</hi> His gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity had over-reached his power, and his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates were involved! That of Ledſtone was an object of too much importance to be aband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by the rapacious creditors; it was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore agreed that it ſhould be put up to ſale, and parted with by public auction.</p>
               <p>A gentleman, the ſon of a wealthy merchant in the city, was the higheſt bidder, and to him was that property conſigned. He was a young man, not poſſeſſed of very ſhining abilities, who had been educated at Weſtminſter-ſchool, and was thence ſent to Oxford. But ſtudy was ill adapted to his taſte; he left both theſe places in diſguſt, and prevailed (but not without diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty) on his father, to ſuffer him to paſs two or three years on the continent, by way of giving a finiſh to his education.</p>
               <p>It was ſoon after his return to England, that he determined to marry, but he had frequently the mortification to find his propoſals rejected. Money was no object to him, as he was ſure to inherit, on the death of his father, a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fortune; but he wiſhed to ennoble his name, hitherto beſt known upon 'Change, and was at lenght fortunate enough to ſucceed in his addreſſes, with the only daughter of a new-created Iriſh peer, who had been ſucceſsful in his claim to the title of his anceſtors, and whoſe greateſt advantage was her title.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="unknown:030497_0005_0FE6F5464F856380"/>It was ſoon after this marriage took place, that he became the purchaſer of Ledſtone, which he knew only by report<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> having never viſited the Weſt of England. In London, Lady Jane was equally a ſtranger. She had paſſed her life in Dublin but remained unnotic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there until her father was created an Earl. They ſet out for London too ſoon afterwards for her to fix her choice among her old acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, who were many of them at length be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come her new admirers.</p>
               <p>Mr. James Martindale was the firſt monied man who ſolicited the hand of Lady Jane; and to his fortune, more than to himſelf, was ſhe immediately devoted.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP II.</head>
               <p>MR. Martindale hired a ready-furniſhed houſe in the vicinity of Portman-Square; and on the fourth of June, juſt five weeks after her marriage, Lady Jane Martindale was preſented at St. James's. Her perſon was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther handſome than otherwiſe, and it was on this occaſion decorated with all the parapher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalia of birth-day magnificence. To be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, it was neceſſary only that ſhe ſhould be ſeen; and to <hi>her,</hi> the knee of adulation was ſoon bent. The Earl of C—, on whom the fetters of matrimony ſat lightly, was her
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:030497_0006_0FE6F551CA7064D0"/>
devoted ſlave for the evening; and her eyes received an additional portion of brilliancy, as her conqueſts became multiplied.</p>
               <p>In Mr. Martindale's boſom very different were the ſenſations which aroſe on that occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He gazed on the beauties of his wife, and his vanity was flattered by their effect, but his heart trembled as he viewed her, and the pangs of jealouſy racked his ſoul. He endeavoured to appear regardleſs of the admiration he ſaw la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed on her; but by degrees he drew nearer to the door of the antechamber, and their wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with anxiety the hour of twelve, at which time his ſervants and equipage were ordered to attend.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as their arrival was announced, Mr. Martindale hurried Lady Jane out of the room, and attempted to put on her cloak, which a footman had given into his hands. But Lord C—diſputed with him th<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

But in this idea he was wholly miſtaken: Lord C—had not entertained an idea beyond the amuſement of the preſent hour, and Lady Jane ſaw nothing in the emaciated peer that could poſſibly turn her thoughts towards him on the ſucceeding one.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="unknown:030497_0007_0FE6F551CF6FA900"/>The time now arrived when every faſhiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble family prepared to leave town. Lady Jane had already made the acquiſition of numberleſs acquaintance, but her heart had not ſelected a friend. It was almoſt a matter of indifference to her whether ſhe went, and to her huſband's inclinations ſhe appeared willing to accede.</p>
               <p>Mr. Martindale's determination was to go to Ledſtone; but when ſhe heard of its ſecluſion, her heart recoiled at the idea, and ſhe requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his approbation of a prior excurſion to Wey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth or Brighthelmſtone. He became howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver abſolute in his intentions; and as her father had immediately after her marriage returned to Ireland, it became neceſſary for her to draw ſome one over to her intereſts; neceſſity, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than choice, directed her to old Mr. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tindale. He was exactly calculated for ſuch an employment. He had been in his younger days a general admirer of pretty women, and the charms of his new daughter-in-law loſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in his opinion. He perfectly agreed with her, that to tranſplant a large eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

Lady Jane and the old gentleman had many converſations on the ſubject, and agreed to expoſtulate warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with Mr. Martindale, whom however they had the mortification to find <hi>inexorable.</hi> All they could obtain was a few days delay, and a promiſe that their ſtay in the country ſhould not exceed ſix months.</p>

               <p>IN a few days, part of Mr. Martindale's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſet forward on their journey into the Weſt. Theſe conſiſted of her Ladyſhip's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwoman, who was, during this ſummer campaign, to act alſo in the capacity of houſe-keeper;—a French valet;—a French cook;— a running footman, and three or four more. Every thing was there in readineſs for the reception of theſe nobel and novel gueſts; for the caſtle was inhabited by an old ſteward and his family, whom the late Earl of Huntingdon had ſtationed in it; and as they had never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived notice to quit the premiſſes, they ſtill enjoyed, in ſome of the rooms at the end of it, peacable and quite poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>When theſe imitators of greatneſs paſſed through the village of Birtland, they were ſtruck with the appearance of its humble inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants; who, miſtaking them for their ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iors, crowded forth to bid them welcome. The bells, though few in number, echoed theſe warm plaudits of the heart; and every tenant, with uplifted eyes, prayed Heaven to bleſs them!</p>
               <p>Stunned with applauſes for which they were unprepared, and which they did not rightly
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:030497_0009_0FE6F5530B0A85D8"/>
comprehend, they anſwered only by a loud laugh; and arriving at the caſtle, where they ſoon made themſelves known, were received with humble civility by the worthy ſteward his wife, and daughter.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Drapery could not help ſhuddering as ſhe paſſed through the ſpacious hall which led to the inhabited part of the caſtle. The maſſy door cloſed with a tremendous noiſe; it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſounded through the vaulted roof, and petrified her with horror. On the high arched win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of painted glaſs, were handed down to poſterity the emblazoned arms of the newly expired title of Huntingdon; and the unwieldy armour which had formerly defended the lives of its illuſtrious wearers, now hanging up and neglected, borrowed a faint light from the feeble glimmerings of the moon, ſcarcely ſeen enough to be obſerved through the heavy caſement.</p>
               <p>She requeſted to be ſhewn to the appartment allotted her, where ſhe gave orders that her fellow-tarvellers ſhould attend. She expreſſed to them the greateſt diſguſt at every thing ſhe ſaw, and the utter impoſſibility there was of her being ever able to accuſtom herſelf among ſuch Hottentots. "She was ſure," ſhe ſaid,
<q>that all Mr. Martindale's money would be but a poor compenſation, if Lady Jane was to linger away the beſt part of her life in ſuch an odious retirement. She wondered how he could think of bringing an Earl's daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſuch a horrible diſtance from every
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:030497_0010_0FE6F55D2B7B83F8"/>
thing alive. For HER part, ſhe was ſure SHE could not ſtay there, and ſhe hoped to find that her Lady would ſoon be of the ſame opinion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In leſs than a week, Lady Jane and Mr. Martindale arrived at Ledſtone. When the loquacious Mrs. Drapery ſaw the butler (to whom ſhe was by do means averſe), ſhe aſſured him, that if ſhe had not been certain of HIS coming down, ſhe could not have prevailed on herſelf to remain there a day after ſhe had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered up her charge to her Lady; for that the place was a deſert, and the evening winds were ſo rough, that ſhe already found her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution DAMAGED by them; and it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come abſolutely neceſſary for her to return to London, were it only for the benefit of her health.</p>
               <p>Lady Jane and Mr. Martindale, who ſaw nothing in their new habitation otherwiſe than they had expected to find it, paſſed ſeveral days in viſiting the caſtle and its environs. Lady Jane was particularly attentive to the narations of the old ſteward, who not unfrequently rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed his hand acroſs his eyes, as he dwelt on the praiſes of his late-loved Lord. In a ſmall clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet adjoining the hall, of which he had entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to keep the key, he was wont to review and admire the tattered robes in which Henry third Earl of Huntingdon ſat in judgment on the trial of the charming and unfortunate Mary Queen of Scots. Theſe he ſhewed Lady Jane, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting ſorely the day, that, in depriving the

county of its FIRST ornament, robbed HIM of his beſt friend—HIS ONLY BENEFACTOR.</p>

               <p>THE mind of Lady Jane was by nature ſuſceptible of tender ſentiments, and of ſoft impreſſions; yet her heart was as unconſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of their primitive ſource, as of their ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent conſequence; and ſhe had hitherto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held every one with general indifference. She however poſſeſſed an immoderate degree of pride and oſtentation, and was emulous to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie all who dared aſpire to equality with her; aſſuming a forbidding air of loftineſs, which often offended the ſocieties ſhe lived in. But, over-ruled at length by the recollection of the more exemplary conduct of ſome of the amiable part of her female acquaintance in London, and elſewhere, ſhe in ſome meaſure conquered that diſagreeable HAUTEUR; and the tender and growing impulſe of nature beginning to inſpire her with ideas more conſonant to the texture of her diſpoſition, ſhe became thoughtful, and rather melancholy; deriving her chief pleaſure from wandering in unfrequented paths, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring and forcing tracks through the mazy and moſt intricate parts of the foreſt, which lay at a ſmall diſtance from the park.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="unknown:030497_0012_0FE6F55E73FBA9B8"/>In one of theſe ſolitary perambulations, chance had directed her ſteps to the ruins of a very ancient, and once capacious tower, ſituate on the ſumit of a ſtupendious cliff. Thence ſhe could obſerve, with the help of a ſmall teleſcope which ſhe carried in her pocket, the various objects which the ocean continually preſented to her view, and which with their novelty and variety together, became every day more pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and intereſting to her fancy.</p>
               <p>Mr. Martindale roſe one morning early in the month of September, before his uſual hour, to take the diverſion of ſhooting; his game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper having apprized him the preceding even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a covey of partridges which frequented a wheat-ſtubble near a pleaſure ground adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the park; not that Mr. Martindale diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered any more enjoyment in the purſuit of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral pleaſures, than did his lady; but his time hanging rather heavy on his hands, and as ſhe did not permit him to beguile any part of it in aſſociating with thoſe whom her own choice had not approved, and pointed out as proper com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions for him, he was obliged to ſeek amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in queſt of pleaſures which nature had not given him either taſte or inclination to enjoy.</p>
               <p>Lady Jane had riſen at her uſual hour, and was preparing for breakfaſt, when Mr. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tindale tired of his viſionary ſcheme of pleaſure, returned heartily fatigued in the purſuit of it.</p>
               <p>The moment they had enjoyed their early repaſt, Lady Jane with eager ſteps precipitate<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:030497_0013_0FE6F55E79609940"/>
bent her way to her much-favoured ſpot; which ſhe had no ſooner aſcended, than ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly diſcovered through her glaſs a ſmall boat making for the ſhore; and excited by cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, ſhe advanced with deliberate attention down the ſandy beach, towards the edge of the water. As the boat approached nearer her view, ſhe thought ſhe perceived in it five per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, together with ſome caſks which they had ſtowed, and piled up in a regular pyramid, in the ſtern of their little bark. The tide having recently laved, and now retired from, its bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy limits, had cauſed the ſand under foot to be exceedingly wet; and what would have wonderfully terrified Lady Jane at any other time, and on any other occaſion, now ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated her boldly to venture on; and ſhe walked, or rather waded, almoſt knee-deep in the briny ocean, till ſhe came within reach of the float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing objects which ſhe had firſt diſcovered; but having left her glaſs within the tower, ſhe could ſcarcely diſtinguiſh of what ſex or age the perſons were, until they approached nearer.</p>
               <p>They were ſoon ſecurely landed in a place where ſhe had not been accuſtomed to meet with human beings (ſhe having dedicated this deſerted ſpot to ſolitude, and her own reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons); and the unexpected ſight our mariners experienced of a beautiful and elegant female, who ſeemed to be loſt in aſtoniſhment, could not fail to excite in them an equal degree of ſurpriſe. After ſome little converſation, they requeſted to be informed of the neareſt town,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:030497_0014_0FE6F561E56666E0"/>
or village; having come, they ſaid, on ſhore for the purpoſe of procuring freſh water for their veſſel, a ſmall brig, bound from Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ock to London, which lay at anchor at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of about two leagues.</p>
               <p>The perſon who chiefly addreſſed himſelf to Lady Jane, appeared to be a military man, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout fifty years of age. He had a complacency of manner which indicated the gentleman; his countenance beaming that ineffable ſweetneſs which generally beſpeaks the mind at eaſe. This gentleman introduced to her his friend who accompanied him (the other three were ſailors, buſily employed in laſhing the boat to the remains of what had formerly been a light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe.) The dreſs of the latter, who was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years younger, denoted him a Highlander; and the gracefulneſs of his mein inſtantly caught the attention of Lady Jane. She invited them both to the caſtle, and promiſed to ſend ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants thence to render their men and boat e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very aſſiſtance their ſituation required.</p>
               <p>This propoſal they thankfully accepted; and inwardly congratulated themſelves on the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel and ſtrange adventure with which chance had ſo far favoured them.</p>

               <p>ON their arrival at the caſtle refreſhments of every kind were by Lady Jane's order ſet before her gueſts. She enquired for Mr. Martindale, but was informed by the butler that he was gone out on horſeback, and had left orders to tell her ladyſhip that he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to dinner by five. She apologized for his abſence, and entreated them to relinquiſh all idea of going back to their veſſel with the evening's tide; obſerving, that the days were now ſhort and clouded—the nights long and dark; and ſhe farther alleged, that their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the coaſt might lead them into un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable difficulties, and imminent dangers, which ſhe would by no means adviſe them to encounter, and which would diminiſh with the return of day-light. She inwardly wiſhed (but from what cauſe ſhe knew not) that Mr. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tindale ſhould ſee them, and approve what ſhe had done. She felt eager to juſtify her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct to him, perhaps from a conſciouſneſs of ſelf-created uneaſineſs ſhe had never before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced. Her fluttering heart beat high with a deſire of ſhe knew not what; and her falter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tongue ſeemed almoſt deprived of utterance, as her eye, involuntarily and conſtantly met thoſe of the young and accompliſhed Caledoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. She wiſhed, ſhe ſaid, to detain them till
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:030497_0016_0FE6F56AE8ED18B8"/>
Mr. Martndale's return; and even when he did return, ſhe feared the day would be too far ſpent for them to hazard with ſafety the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of regaining their ſhip:—ſhe at laſt hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the elder gentleman, who ſeemed anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to depart, the kind of impropriety there would be in their going away without ſeeing him. This objection had ſufficient force, to counter-balance, in their minds, every other.</p>
               <p>Having drawn from them a promiſe ſhe too ardently wiſhed, ſhe requeſted their attendance in the park and gardens, whither they cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully conſented to accompany her. In one of the walks ſhe perceived by accident that her dreſs had materially ſuffered from her excurſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on the ſands; ſhe then left her viſitors to the care of the gardener, whom ſhe directed to point out to them every object worthy their attention, and proceeded to the caſtle to change her clothes; deſiring the gardener to re-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct the gentlemen there, as ſoon as their curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity had been ſufficiently gratified.</p>
               <p>On her lapyſhip's return ſhe retired to her appartment, and ordered her woman's atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance there. The article of dreſs, which had been neglected ſince her ſecluſion in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as a matter of indifference, now became an object of importance. Mrs. Drapery was one of thoſe accommodating abigails who are ever ready to flatter and encourage the follies and vices of their employers, and ſhe neglected nothing on the preſent occaſion to adorn the perſon of her lady; ſignificantly adding,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:030497_0017_0FE6F56AEDD11488"/>
                  <q>With what pleaſure her maſter would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold her ladyſhip at his return home, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once more LIKE HERSELF!</q>
               </p>
               <p>Before the etiquette of dreſs was finally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted, Mr. Martindale entered the room ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what abruptly; having been informed by the ſervants of his new viſitors, and wiſhing, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to his ſeeing them, to know of Lady Jane who they were, and what were the motives that had thus induced them to take up their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence in his houſe.</p>
               <p>Lady Jane briefly related to her huſband each circumſtance; contenting herſelf with obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that although ſhe had not enquired their names, ſhe was ſure, from the little ſhe had ſeen of them, that they were perſons of no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior rank: ſhe juſtly remarked that the laws of hoſpitality were of themſelves ſufficient to juſtify the haſty zeal with which ſhe had preſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to wait his return. Mr. Martindale coincided with her opinion, and left her to do honour to his gueſts.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as he was gone, Mrs. Drapery, finding herſelf emboldened by her lady's viſible embarraſſment (which together with the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to her dreſs had not eſcaped her), begged pardon for informing her ladyſhip, that ſhe knew perfectly well who the gentlemen were, having enquired of the ſailors, who had ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her in every reſpect. They were both, ſhe ſaid, Scots. The old gentleman, whoſe name was <hi>Stuart,</hi> had been many years Colonel of
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:030497_0018_0FE6F57305362AE0"/>
the <hi>Mountaineers;</hi> but had retired from the ſervice about two years. His lady was lately dead, and the loſs of her had taken ſuch an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effect on his mind, that he had reſolved to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel; and a ſea voyage had been particularly recommended to him, as being the moſt likely to recruit both his ſpirits and his health. The young gentleman<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whoſe name was <hi>Glencairn,</hi> was diſtantly related to the deceaſed Mrs. Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>art, who had one only child, a daughter, now educating in a convent at Calais. She was to come over on their arrival in London, and to return with them. Mrs. Drapery indeed FAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CIED, but it was only her own conjecture, that the Colonel had thoughts of uniting the young couple; as the young gentleman had no other reaſon for coming over, than that of keeping the Colonel company; and of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him to Scotland, as ſoon as Miſs Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>art ſhould have joined them.</p>
               <p>Lady Jane was not ſo regardleſs as ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be of the information given by her officious waiting-woman. She, however, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed an air of compoſure ſhe was doomed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more to feel, and with haſty ſteps joined the gentlemen below.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI.</head>
               <p>COLONEL Stuart had been in the mean time equally communicative to Mr. Martindale; he had conſidered it as incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on him to introduce himſelf and friend to his acquaintance. Mr. Martindale, ſoon after Lady Jane's appearance, retired to his dreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-room, whence he ſent to requeſt her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance for a few minutes; when he inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, that ſhe was not miſtaken in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable opinion ſhe had entertained of the ſtrangers; and proceeded to tell her all with which Colonel Stuart had made him acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. She did not think it neceſſary to mention to him the cenverſation ſhe had held with her maid; but pretended to liſten with curioſity to what he related; which differed in nothing more than his ſilence on the ſubject of Miſs Stuart, who ſhe naturally concluded had not been mentioned.</p>
               <p>Lady Jane returned to the ſaloon, where ſhe ſurpriſed Glencairn drawing ſounds of ſweeteſt melody from Mr. Martindale's flute, which lay on the table. He laid it down when ſhe appeared, but by her deſire took it up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and played once more, at Colonel Stuart's requeſt,
<q>I wiſh I was where Helen lies!</q>
                  <pb n="21" facs="unknown:030497_0020_0FE6F57424A001D0"/>
in a manner ſo peculiarly his own, that Lady Jane, for the firſt time in her life, felt the power of muſic over a ſuſceptible mind. She was at that moment alive to the moſt tender ſenſations; her ſoul vibrated to the touch, and ſhe felt a pang of exquiſite enthuſiaſm.</p>
               <p>—He ceaſed;—and her eyes more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive than her tongue, ſolicited his connu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. He ſmiled conſent, and then play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<q>Abſence ne'er ſhall alter me.</q>
The words ſunk deep into her heart; her fine eyes gliſtened;—and ſhe had but juſt time to turn them on Colonel Stuart, as Mr. Martin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale entered the room.</p>
               <p>The converſation became general, and din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was announced. It was a domeſtic <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and Lady Jane being without a female friend, had no excuſe to leave the room when it was over. Mr. Martindale and the Colonel enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a long converſation, and the old war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior-ſeeming for a moment to forget his griefs, gloried as he recounted his former exploits.</p>
               <p>Tea, and leſs intereſting airs on the flute beguiled the remainder of the evening; and an early ſupper was ordered, as our viſitors were under the neceſſity of departing by day-break. Lady Jane gave orders that coffee ſhould be prepared for them, and after an hour or two paſſed in ſocial delight, they reciprocally bade adieu.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="unknown:030497_0021_0FE6F57429657D08"/>The Colonel expreſſed to Mr. Martindale his wiſh of meeting with him in town; but ſaid that as he might not be appriſed of the time when the Ledſtone family arrived there; and as he was ignorant alſo in what part of it he ſhould fix his ſhort abode, he begged of Mr. Martindale to take the trouble to enquire after him at the Ducheſs of G—'s in St. Jame's Square, who would be able to aſcertain whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſtill remained an inhabitant of London, or was returned (which was more likely) to the ſequeſtered mountains of Scotland.</p>
               <p>Lady Jane had no ſooner retired into her dreſſing-room, than ſhe gave orders to Mrs. Drapery (who, as I before obſerved, now acted in the double capacity of her woman and houſe-keeper) to riſe at a very early hour, that nothing might be wanting to complete the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant hoſpitality the ſtrangers had experienced at Ledſtone. She retired to bed, but did ſhe retire to reſt?—Ah, no!—The image of Glencairn was before her; ſhe pretended drowſineſs, and in ſecret ſilence wept her cares to ſleep. Mr. Martindale, fatigued by the exerciſe and events of the day, and unconſcious of the thorns of diſcontent which invincible LOVE had ſtrewed over his wife's pillow,
<q>Snor'd out the watch of night.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Lady Jane liſtened at day break, but ſhe heard nothing. All was huſhed in profound ſilence. They had departed an hour before their appointed time: but they had not eſcaped
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:030497_0022_0FE6F57E144EA778"/>
the anxious vigilance of Mrs. Drapery; who fearful of offending her lady by not ſeeing them, and fearful alſo, of her own weakneſs ſhould ſhe truſt herſelf to ſleep, had prevailed on her friend the butler to paſs the intermediate time with her in the houſe-keeper's room, over a comfortable bottle of madeira, which he was to provide from the cellar as ſoon as the family was retired to reſt.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Drapery, though a keen woman, was by no means deſtitute of female weakneſs: ſhe repoſed an implicit confidence in the butler, and at once informed him of her ſuſpicions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to her lady, and the young gentleman; who (ſhe muſt obſerve) was of a figure to cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate any lady's heart, She did not know (or had not ſenſe enough to find out) that Mr. Oldſon, the butler, was warmly in his maſter's intereſt; not from any raſh confidence <hi>that</hi> hitherto inſenſible maſter had repoſed in him, but from a ſenſe of the lucrative place he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed. Mr. Oldſon therefore made few com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on her obſervations, but treaſured up in his mind, every circumſtance that might lead hereafter to a farther aſcendancy over Mr. Martindale; as he had already prevailed on him in many trivial occurrences, which had turned out in the end to his own advantage.</p>
               <p>Soon after the bottle of madeira was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, Mrs. Drapery told him ſhe heard a noiſe; but ſhe ſuppoſed it to be too early for the ſtrangers to be thinking of their departure. She however liſtened, and heard it repeated;
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:030497_0023_0FE6F57E1A11B4C0"/>
it was, ſhe ſaid, the ſound of feet gently mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving down the great ſtair-caſe. Mr. Oldſon liſtened, but heard nothing. Mrs. Drapery ſtill perſiſted that ſhe DID hear a noiſe; and as ſhe had encouraged the idea of ghoſts haunting the caſtle, ſhe requeſted Mr. Oldſon to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany her up the ſtair-caſe leading from her room; at the top of which they ſaw our five travellers ready to depart. Mrs. Drapery's eyes inſtantly fixed on thoſe of Glencairn; who anſwered them by a ſign that he had ſomething to communicate. It was eaſy for her to turn Mr. Oldſon's attention to the other, while ſhe privately received from his hands a guinea, and a ſlip of paper carefully folded and ſealed. Theſe ſhe immediately conveyed to her pocket, while Mr. Oldſon was making his bow to the Colonel, in acknowledgement of what he had from a very different motive conveyed to him.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Drapery and Mr. Oldſon ſaw the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers depart, and then retired to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective rooms. The former cautiouſly placed her pockets under her head, as fearful that her ſecret ſhould be diſcovered, and by that means the confidence of her lady be loſt for ever.</p>

               <p>IT was not difficult for Mrs. Drapery to underſtand the uſe it was intended ſhe ſhould make of both the objects ſhe had received; yet ſhe was not ſufficiently miſtreſs of her lady's thoughts to hazard a forward avowal of her conduct in receiving them. When ſhe attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Lady Jane in the morning, ſhe could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void perceiving that ſhe had been in tears; and ſhe preſumed to enquire with evident ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of affection, <hi>if her ladyſhip was unwell?</hi> At this unexpected queſtion, Lady Jane gave vent to her full heart, and ſtrove not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal her emotion. She imprudently leaned on her woman's boſom, and, in apparent agony, aſked whether the gentlemen were gone, and if ſhe had ſeen them? Mrs. Drapery told her that they were; and that ſhe had attended them according to her ladyſhip's order. She drew by degrees the letter out of her pocket, and entreated her ladyſhip's pardon for the liberty ſhe took in offering it to her peruſal. She aſſured her that ſhe had no time to return it after it had been put into her hands; and that pity for the poor young gentleman's ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row at his departure had afterwards induced her to ſecrete it, until ſhe might ſee him a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gain.</p>

                  <pb n="26" facs="unknown:030497_0025_0FE6F57FAAD437D8"/>Lady Jane took the letter with ſeeming re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance, and found it to contain the following words:</p>

               <p>Lady Jane trembled as ſhe read the letter, which ſhe immediately conveyed into her pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, and Mrs. Drapery delighted in the ſucceſs of her undertaking; for although ſhe felt that cuſtom, and the laws of decency, would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that ſhe ſhould maintain her place as a ſervile dependant, ſhe from this moment conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered herſelf the boſom friend of her lady; and exulting in what had paſſed, began to ſuppoſe herſelf the appointed and convenient confidante of every future action of her life.</p>
               <p>From this unhappy period, ſhe began to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert the influence ſhe had obtained over the mind of her hitherto ſpotleſs lady; and avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herſelf of anadvantage common to low minds, did not fail NOW AND THEN to remind her, by a gentle hint, that ſhe was in her power. Lady Jane's youth, and ignorance of the world, induced her to be ſilent where ſhe might have been allowed to complain; but

her timid ſoul as apprehenſive of the injurious conſtruction her huſband might put on the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, and ſhe reſolved to ſuffer in ſilence. She had no wiſh. no intention to deceive him; yet ſhe ſighed as ſhe reflected on the merits of Glencairn, whom ſhe deſpaired of ſeeing more.</p>
               <p>We will now return to our mariners. They had a tedious and rather perilous paſſage to London, where they landed in three weeks. Colonel Stuart's firſt care was to diſpatch a meſſenger to a mercantile houſe in the city, whether his letters were addreſſed. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived one from Miſs Stuart, earneſtly requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to go to her. She informed him that her health had been for ſome months gradually declining; but that ſhe had hitherto avoided mentioning that circumſtance to him, waiting till ſhe heard of his arrival in London; alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that ſhe was ſufficiently acquainted with his feelings, to be convinced that had he known her ſituation ſooner, he would have haſtened his journey from Scotland, probably to the prejudice both of his health and conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ience.</p>
               <p>Colonel Stuart had not ſeen his daughter ſince her mother's death, as ſhe had been near four years at Calais. He ſpoke of her ſeldom; but his thoughts often dwelt with rapture on the idea of once more folding his treaſure to his heart, and retracing in her growing fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures the reſemblance of his loſt and lamented wife! Alas! what were the ſenſations he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:030497_0027_0FE6F588A8F4E8B8"/>
at the peruſal of her fatal letter! It was a deep ſtub to his wounded mind, and it became neceſſary for him to call religion and reaſon to his aid, to prevent him from immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſinking under the weight of it.</p>
               <p>All that friendſhip could ſuggeſt—all that the moſt tender ſympathy could invent, were on this trying occaſion warmly exerted by the amiable Glencairn towards his unhappy friend. He urged the poſſibility of Miſs Stuart's being too eaſily alarmed about herſelf; that the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy inſeparable from a monaſtic life had probably induced her to give way to ideas which <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 words">
                     <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> their principle origin from her ſecluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;—that the moſt effectual means to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed towards promoting her recovery, were to amuſe her mind; which had ſcarcely began to unfold itſelf, ere the event of her mother's death, and her father's ſubſequent correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, ſtamped an impreſſion on it, that time, and a more ſuitable way of life, would be (in <hi>his</hi> opinion) alone capable to efface.</p>
               <p>The voice of conſolation inſenſibly gained upon the Colonel; his misfortunes grew ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as he liſtened to the advice of his friend; his heart in a few hours recovered in ſome meaſure its former ſerenity; and inſtead of waſting time in deploring the evil that threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened him, he endeavoured to avert it by haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening to join and cheriſh her, who, ſince the death of his wife, ſeemed doubly entitled to his care and protection.</p>

               <p>NOTHING material occurred during their journey to Calais; but Glencairn, to whom every object was new, was ſurpriſed at the different ſcenes that preſented themſelves. Often, however, did his imagination retrace the image of Lady Jane Martindale; ſhe was the firſt woman he had ever beheld with emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and her expreſſive looks had taught him to believe that he was not indifferent to her. He lamented both the cauſe and its effect, that had, by preventing their continuing in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, deprived him of being preſented at the Ducheſs of G—'s, where he could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the only chance of the Colonel's hearing of, or ſeeing Mr. Martindale. But theſe reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he was obliged to conceal; they remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his ſecret buried in his heart- and he was under too many obligations to the Colonel not to endeavour (at leaſt) to ſuppreſs them.</p>
               <p>When they landed at Calais, and had reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Monſiur Deſſin's hotel there, Colonel Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>art found himſelf fatigued and agitated by his journey. He requeſted Glencairn to go immediately to the convent, with a note from him to the ſuperior, deſiring her to ſend Miſs Stuart, with the bearer, his friend. Glen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cairn had formerly ſeen her; but it was dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:030497_0029_0FE6F589EA2F7BF8"/>
thoſe days of infancy on either ſide, that had left but few traces behind them. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered his letter at the gate of the convent, and was conducted to the parlour, on one ſide of which, was a large grate; and on the other ſide, a curtain that was drawn. In a few minutes it was removed, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to his view a form that nature had tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en pride in adorning.</p>
               <p>Miſs Stuart (for it was herſelf) was the moſt finiſhed picture of human perfection. She raiſed her blue eyes as he addreſſed her, and politely requeſting him to wait a few minutes, diſappeared to put herſelf in readineſs to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him.</p>
               <p>She ſoon rejoined him in the parlour, and they proceeded on foot to the hotel. She ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted his arm, and he perceived with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme ſorrow that ſhe had ſcarcely ſufficient ſtrength to proceed. Yet ſhe did not once complain, but paſſed the ſhort time in making a thouſand tender enquiries about her father.</p>
               <p>The meeting between them was highly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting; they were equally ſenſible of the changes each other's looks had experienced, yet neither dared to acknowledge that they perceived any alteration. It was but too evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that Miſs Stuart was in the early ſtage of a conſumption, which appeared to be faſt haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening this beauteous bloſſom to a premature decay. It was ſoon determined that ſhe ſhould immediately leave the convent; that the next morning her expences ſhould be paid there;
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:030497_0030_0FE6F59410556198"/>
and her clothes taken away; and that they ſhould allow themſelves a few days repoſe at Calais, before they fixed on any plan their inclinations might for the preſent lead them to purſue.</p>
               <p>Miſs Stuart had contracted an intimacy in the convent with a Miſs Beaumont, a young lady of French extraction, and ſomewhat old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than herſelf. The very ſlender fortune ſhe was to inherit, had induced her parents to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade her to take the veil, to which ſhe was perfectly reconciled. Having lived in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſince ſhe was ſix years old, ſhe had not a wiſh to ſee the world, but had partly reſolved to enter on her noviciate the following year.</p>
               <p>Miſs Stuart called there the next morning, and took leave of her friend. They agreed to correſpond during the remainder of their lives, and that no intereſting circumſtance ſhould oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to the one, with which the other ſhould not become acquainted.</p>
               <p>Our travellers had been near a week at Calais, and Colonel Stuart thought it time to fix their departure. But whither were they to go? He wiſhed, for his own gratification, to return home; but he thought it would be, at that time, a wrong meaſure to adopt on his daughter's account. For this he had a double motive: Winter was ſetting in, and he na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally conceived that the keen blaſts of the North would have too powerful an influence over her delicate and affected frame. He feared
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:030497_0031_0FE6F5941432BB08"/>
alſo, from the exquiſite ſenſibility he preceived her to poſſeſs, that ſhe might receive a fatal blow to her peace, when, on her return to her firſt home, every object which appeared there would remind her of its loſt ornament, her mother!—The Colonel had, ſince her death, found a melancholy pleaſure in arrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every thing at Allan-Bank for her reception. All that had belonged to Mrs. Suart, he had collected carefully for her daughter; but he had no idea of the faded form he was to meet; he had ſeen her a healthy, though delicate girl; and he naturally expected to find in her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved underſtanding, and formerly lively diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, the companion beſt ſuited to ſooth the anguiſh of his mind, whenever he reflected on the virtues of that incomparable wife of which the grave had robbed him!</p>
               <p>In the evening, when Miſs Stuart had retired to her appartment, the Colonel rang for ano-bottle of Monſieur Deſſin's beſt Burgundy, and imparted to Glencairn his reflections of the day. He obſerved, that having nothing to conſult but their reſpective inclinations, he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained an idea of their traveling South; that he thought his beloved Mary's health required change of air, and he conceived it poſſible THAT of Italy might reſtore it. She would alſo derive many advantages from ſuch a TOUR, that were not to be met with in Scotland. It would afford her a fine-opportunity of improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herſelf in muſic, of which ſhe was paſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately fond; and ſhe would by travelling gain a ſufficient knowledge of the world, to conquer
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:030497_0032_0FE6F5954FDC6CC0"/>
that awkward baſhfulneſs, which gave her a childiſh air of ſimplicity, and which it would be neceſſary for her to overcome before ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided at his houſe, of which, alas! ſhe was now become ſole miſtreſs. Glencairn could not with any propriety appear to diſapprove this ſcheme, and nothing remained but to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Miſs Stuart's approbation (of which they could have no doubt); and that obtained, they reſolved to quit Calais, and paſs through Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence to Nice.</p>
               <p>Miſs Stuart was, as they expected, pleaſed with the propoſal; and nothing was wanting to complete the ſatisfaction of the party, but a more cheerful acquieſcence on the part of Glen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cairn, who vainly endeavoured to forget his predilection for Lady Jane Martindale. He experienced an inquietude hitherto unknown to him, when he reflected on the impoſſibility there now was of his communicating to her his ſentiments, and the knowledge of his ſituation. He dared not hazard writing to her by the poſt; and though the ſailors had told him Mrs. Drapery's name, his reſpect and delicacy forbade his addreſſing himſelf to her. He was forced therefore for the preſent to relinquiſh all hope of ſeeing, hearing of, or writing to her; and he felt the force of Rochefoucault's juſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, that
<q>Abſence leſſens ſmall paſſions, and encreaſes great ones.</q>
For he never loved Lady Jane ſo PASSION<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ATELY
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:030497_0033_0FE6F595541FE2D0"/>
as at this moment, while he deſpaired of ever ſeeing her more.</p>

               <p>THE next day was employed in preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for their departure; and on the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing morning they began their journey in a berline the Colonel had purchaced of Monſieur Deſſin. They were attended only by a French ſervant who had travelled all his life, ſpoke a little Engliſh, and whom Deſſin had recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.</p>
               <p>I ſhall paſs over every natural incident that occurred to them, and obſerve only that they reached Nice ſoon after the time they had calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to do ſo; when, after paſſing a few days at the hotel, they hired by the month an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant villa in its environs.</p>
               <p>The Colonel had procured letters of credit on the Engliſh banker there, and they were all alike charmed with their new ſituation. Their ſervant Louis had been there frequently, and was become their <hi>Proveditore-Generale.</hi> Miſs Stuart hired a maid for herſelf, by name Joſephine, which, with an Italian cook, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated their family.</p>
               <p>Colonel Stuart was an independent, though
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:030497_0034_0FE6F59E4CFEFB08"/>
not a rich man. His income had never been involved, and it produced him from five to ſix hundred pounds a year. He had no one to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for but his daughter.</p>
               <p>With his protégé Glencairn it was otherwiſe, He was an orphan, without a friend in the world but the Colonel, who (having been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years intimate with his deceaſed father, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantly related to Mrs. Stuart, and who was a younger brother of high birth, whoſe fortune periſhed with his life) had adopted this <hi>child of love,</hi> and promiſed never to deſert him. He adhered to his word, and was ſufficiently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed in favour of his young ward, to WISH that a future attachment might take place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and his daughter, that his fortune might by their marriage equally devolve on both. With this view, he had ſpared no pains to cultivate the mind of the young Edward, who repaid his tender care with all that filial duty and ſincere affection could beſtow.</p>
               <p>It was with this young couple, as with all our untravelled iſlanders, whoſe extent of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uropean knowledge carries them no father than the boundaries of England; every object be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Dover becoming a matter of wonder. Thus it was with our North Britons. Miſs Stuart and Glencairn were loſt in aſtoniſhment at every new ſcene which preſented itſelf to their view, and they ſeemed to fancy themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of another world. They were left almoſt entirely to themſelves; for Colonel Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>art was a man of ſuch ſtrict honour, and had
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:030497_0035_0FE6F59E50DB46F0"/>
withal ſo much family-pride, that he believed it impoſſible they ſhould derogate from either: his only apprehenſion was, that neither poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſufficient confidence to explain thoſe mutual ſentiments which he thought muſt be inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from both. In this opinion he was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together miſtaken. Their time paſſed away in innocent delight; and Miſs Stuart's health be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning viſibly to mend, they amuſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in viſiting every curioſity, with which the charming country they were now become inhabitants of, abounded.</p>
               <p>To the vicinity of Nice, innumerable were the pictureſque ſcenes which met their raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed eyes. How beautiful do the maritime Alps appear, as they riſe from the ocean! from whence aſcending by gentle degrees, they form a ſuperb amphitheatre, bounded by Mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>albano, projecting into the ſea, and over hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the town. On the other ſide, where pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects leſs ſtupendous allure the eye, how charming do the richly cultivated plains ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, while they preſent to the view the vines, the citrons, the oranges, the bergamots, and every luxury which Earth can furniſh to her inhabitants!—The gardens, which are during the winter months equally profuſe of the ſweeteſt flowers, convinced them, that in that terreſtrial paradiſe the Lord of all had been peculiarly bounteous, and that to be happy it was neceſſary only to forget every disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that had hitherto awaited them in this ſublunary world.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="unknown:030497_0036_0FE6F59F61398228"/>But how vain is every endeavour to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the feelings of the human heart!—They riſe ſuperior to controul, and if they reign at all, they reign with tyranny. Glencairn muſt have been more than mortal, leſs than man, could he have reſided under the ſame roof with the all faſcinating Mary, without feeling the power of her improving charms. He was not blind to them, but often in ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy lamented his way ward deſtiny, which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed determined in ſpite of every oppoſition to ſeparate them through life. An idea, prior to his ſeeing Mary, had taken full poſſeſſion of him. He had beheld Lady Jane Martindale, and his heart had vowed to her everlaſting love. He even cheriſhed the certainty of her huſband's not being IMMORTAL; and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it poſſible for a time to arrive, nay, he even believd it to be not far diſtant, when he might return to England, and claim her as his own.</p>
               <p>How viſionary is every ſcheme of future bliſs, and how precarious are the wiſhes of man!—He builds his hope on a ſhadow; and ſcarcely has he time to admire the fabric his imagination has raiſed, ere it vaniſhes, and his dream of happineſs at once diſappears!</p>

               <p>WE will now return to Ledſtone, where nothing material occured during the ſummer and autumn months, more than has been mentioned. Lady Jane and Mr. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tindale lived peaceably together, ſeldom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting each other, but particularly agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on one point, that of looking forward with pleaſure to the deſtined time of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to London. Lady Jane ſometimes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, recollected Glencairn; but thoſe emoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhe had experienced at firſt ſeeing him, had ſubſided into a languid indifference, and her thoughts became every day more devoted to the idea of the pleaſures ſhe ſhould enjoy in the gay metropolis. She did not however ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect at times viſiting her favourite ſpot; but it was now winter, and the coldneſs of the weather prevented her ſitting there as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, watching the boſom of the deep.</p>
               <p>She was one morning returning from it, and near the houſe, when ſhe perceived Mr. Martindale coming towards her with a letter in his hand. His countenance bore the viſible marks of diſcontent. He took her arm within his; and ſlightly obſerving that he had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unpleaſant to communicate, but without mentioning of what nature, they proceeded to the library, where, without hiſitation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:030497_0038_0FE6F5A75D2939A8"/>
read to her the letter. It was from his father. It firſt contained a few vague enquiries after them, and then informed them, that being at length tired of a ſingle life, he had reſolved to marry a ſecond time. He had partly, he ſaid, fixed his choice. The Lady (he obſerved) was not of a diſtinguiſhed family, neither did ſhe poſſeſs a brilliant fortune; but ſhe had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good qualities, and he had no doubt of the approbation ſhe would meet with from his ſon and daughter, to whom he hoped in a few months to introduce her as his wife. He nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mentioned her name, her age, nor her perſon; and of theſe, various were the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they entertained. Mr. Martindale highly reſpected his father, and dreaded ſeeing him the dupe of what he naturally ſuppoſed to be (from the caution obſerved in the letter) an indiſcreet engagement. Another motive too, and in ſome breaſts it would have been a more powerful one than it was in that of Mr. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tindale, was <hi>ſelf-intereſt.</hi> The old gentleman had, on the death of his wife, ſettled all his landed property on his ſon; but he had a great deal of ready money; five thouſand pounds of which he had given him on his marriage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his mother's jointure of two thouſand pounds a year, which was, in caſe of Lady Jane's ſurviving him, to be her portion for life. He had been indeed particularly liberal on that occaſion, having preſented Lady Jane with the late Mrs. Martindale's jewels, which were of conſiderable value, and he had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed every thing for them, ſuch as equipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, plate, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="unknown:030497_0039_0FE6F5A76119A9D0"/>It was impoſſible they could foreſee with pleaſure an union which would divide, if it did not wholly alienate, the affections of Mr. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tindale from his family. After they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted together for ſome time on the ſubject, they agreed to ſet out for London with all convenient expedition. Mr. Martindale an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered his father's letter, but in terms almoſt as equivocal as his own. He expreſſed ſome ſurpriſe at the half confidence repoſed in him, and concluded by wiſhing him every happineſs in whatever ſituation he might hereafter find <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>; but he did not give the moſt diſtant hint of his intention of going to town, which was in hopes, if it were not already too late, to fruſtrate the old gentleman's preſent intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>As they had no houſe there, they were on their arrival obliged to put up at an hotel; and had on that account left all their ſervants, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting Mrs. Drapery and the butler, at Led<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone. They had not been there many minu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, before Mr. Martindale ſent for a hackney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coach, and went to his father's houſe in the city. But how great was his aſtoniſhment, when, on knocking at the door, a footman in an unknown livery appeared at it, and inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him, that the houſe was now in poſſeſſion of another family; Mr. Martindale having been married about a month, and that he reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in Devonſhire Place!</p>
               <p>Mr. Martindale ſmothered as much as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble his indignation and ſurpriſe. He directed
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:030497_0040_0FE6F5AA5889B530"/>
the coachman to return to the hotel, and gave himſelf up to his reflections in this firſt inſtance of duplicity on his father; for it was evident to him, that he was actually married at the time he wrote to him; and that the ceremony muſt have been performed in a very private manner, not a ſingle news-paper having announced it.</p>
               <p>When he returned to Lady Jane, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed her what had paſſed, he had the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to find that her feelings were perfectly congenial with his own: ſhe perſuaded him to wait till the next day for farther intelligence; and amidſt a thouſand conjectures—apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons—and uncertainties—they paſſed the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and retired early to reſt.</p>

               <p>MR. James Martindale, at a ſeaſonable hour, diſpatched his own ſervant with a dutiful, yet cool billet of congratulation to his father, requeſting to know at what, hour he might be premitted to wait on him.</p>
               <p>Though it was but juſt two o'clock when the valet was ſent on his errand, he found the crowd of ſervants and carriages ſo great at Mr. Martindale's door, that it had more the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:030497_0041_0FE6F5AA5DB83EF0"/>
of the Exhibition at Somerſet-Houſe, than of belonding to a citizen.</p>
               <p>It was ſome minutes before he could prevail on one of the footmen to carry up the note he was intruſted with. After waiting a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time for an anſwer, a verbal one was brought him by another powdered coxcomb, which was ſimply Mr. Martindale's compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and that he would call at the hotel within an hour. Lady Jane was ſtanding at one of the windows of it about four o'clock, when a ſumptuous vis-a-vis ſtopped at the door. Mr. Martindale was ſitting by the fire-ſide, reading a new pamphlet, when Lady Jane's precipitate exclamation, of "Good "God! this cannot be your father!" inſtantly drew him towards her. They thought they recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized his features, though diſguiſed under a ſmall wig, made to look like his own hair; which gave ſo great an alteration to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, that it was impoſſible for them at the firſt moment to aſcertain whether or no it was really him they ſaw. They were however ſoon convinced, as he hobbled out of his carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age ſupported by two ſervants in yellow and ſilver liveries: the plain blue and buff, which had been the family ſtandard of many years, was to all appearance diſcarded, with the brown bob of former and more reſpectable days.</p>
               <p>Mr. Martindale received the congratulations of his ſon and daughter with much ſeeming plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and apologized with rather a diſconcert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed air for the ſecrecy he had obſerved towards

them; alledging as his reaſon for it, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions he had entertained for their diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveing his marriage; to which however he was very certain no reaſonable objection could be ſtated, unleſs it was that of a diſparity of years; Mrs. Martindale being extreamly young, and extreamly handſome. He was commiſſioned by her, he ſaid, to ſay a thouſand kind things to them both; and to aſſure them of her regret at finding herſelf engaged not only for that day, but for the ſucceeding one; but ſhe hoped they would not refuſe her the favour of their company to ſupper that night at twelve, after the opera, where ſhe was going. To this they aſſented, more from curioſity than inclination, and the old bridegroom took his leave.</p>
               <p>Mr. Martindale, in going down the ſtair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe with his father, enquired the former name of his mother-in-law; but received a very laconic anſwer, that it was <hi>Harvey;</hi> of a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the North of England, with which he could not poſſibly be acquainted.</p>
               <p>He returned, and ſat down in ſullen ſilence; but Lady Jane laughed. She had no envy in her compoſition, and was prepared to admire the ſuperior beauties of Mrs. Martindale, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a wiſh to outvie them, or to find them any way inferior to the old gentleman's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription.</p>
               <p>At the appointed hour they went to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonſhire-Place. Mrs. Martindale was but juſt
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:030497_0043_0FE6F5B52F722DE0"/>
returned home, having lounged, ſhe ſaid, long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than ſhe intended in the ſaloon of the opera-houſe.</p>
               <p>If her viſitors were ſtruck with the beauty of her perſon (than which nothing could be more captivating), they were not leſs ſo with the dazzling ſplendour of her dreſs, A rich gold muſlin, made into a Circaſſian robe, with a turban of white crape, ornamented with a profuſion of diamonds, gave her the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of an eaſtern princeſs; but there was an air of levity in her manner, that inſtantly caught the attention of young Mr. Martindale; who had ſcarcely beheld her, ere his heart formed a wiſh that no violent intimacy might in future take place between her and his wife.</p>
               <p>The more he ſaw of this youthful bride (whoſe appearance did not beſpeak her age to be more than ſeventeen), the leſs he liked her; and while he drew her into a converſation, in which he perceived that her ignorance and ſelf-ſufficiency were predominant, he pleaſed himſelf on the compariſon he could not avoid making between her, and the leſs beautiful, but more lovely and unadorned Lady Jane; who having, ſince the ſmall portion of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſhe had obtained of her heart, loſt a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſhare of that pride which had ever been her greateſt foible, was become infinitely more intereſting to ſociety, and more amiable in the eyes of her huſband. In HER was blend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all that increaſing ſenſibility could beſtow on an intelligent mind. Polite without flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:030497_0044_0FE6F5B6A91F2150"/>
ſhe every day gained on the eſteem of thoſe who knew her. Mrs. Martindale, by endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to appear the woman of faſhion, for which ſhe was never intended, was at times e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven vulgar; and her obſcure origin was not counterbalanced by the graces of her mind. Nature had been, it is true, profuſely laviſh on her perſon; but her diſpoſition was avaricious and mean. She diſliked Lady Jane's ſuperior birth, but ſhe had cunning to diſſemble; and endeavoured to flatter her into a belief, that ſhe had never ſeen any woman with whom ſhe ſo much longed to cultivate a friendſhip, as herſelf.</p>
               <p>We will now take leave of this family party for the night; they parted, not without a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary offer from Mrs, Martindale to break off all acquaintance with thoſe of her ſociety whom Lady Jane might not approve. I will next inform my readers who was Mrs. Martin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale; which, together with the little ſketch I have drawn of her diſpoſition, will in ſome meaſure enable them to account for the tenor of her future conduct; at leaſt, if they think as I do, that a low mind never attains any degree of excellence, however the perſon may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted. The heart when <hi>good</hi> is incorruptible, however the mind may be overuled by the force of cuſtom and of example: but when both theſe are bad, the ſtain is indelible, and can never be expunged.</p>

               <p>MRS. Martindale was one of the many children of a reſpectable tradeſman in Newcaſtle, and on a viſit to her elder ſiſter, married to a corn-factor in the city, when Mr. Martindale firſt ſaw her. He ſoon became en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amoured; for his heart was not ſufficiently fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen by age to be able to withſtand the reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of youth and beauty. The idea, however, of marrying her, or any other woman, did not once occur to him. The ſiſter, who was artful and deſigning, perceived his inclinations, and determined to turn his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the advantage of her family. She invit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or rather forced him into all their parties; and finding, after a few weeks, that he did not make any overtures towards her ſiſter's eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment, ſhe told him with much apparent concern, that ſhe found her ſiſter's character had ſuffered materially from his conſtant atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on her; that ſhe had loſt by it a very eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible marriage; the gentleman (who was a young officer) having withdrawn his addreſſes in conſequence of it, and that it was become neceſſary for him to diſcloſe his intentions, of whatever nature they might be.</p>
               <p>This was a trial for which the old gentleman
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:030497_0046_0FE6F5C1DA4D7988"/>
was not prepared. He heſitated, as undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined what to anſwer; till on being told that there was no alternative between his marrying Miſs Harvey, or ſeeing her no more, he was weak enough to wipe the tears from his eyes, and in half-broken ſentences, extorted by FEAR, as well as LOVE, he promiſed to offer her his hand. In leſs than half an hour he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to fall into the ſnare that was laid for him. The family deſired the engagement might be kept ſecret, in order to avoid, they ſaid, the ill-natured ſarcaſms and reflections the world would caſt upon his age: but the truth was, they dreaded the advice of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> his REAL FRIENDS, and hurried him into <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 words">

               <p>Having been thus prevailed on without dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, he thought of nothing but his intended bride. He was profuſe in his preſents to her; and on her mentioning; that ſhe thought the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty air inimical to her health, he diſpatched an agent, of her ſiſter's recommending, in purſuit of a houſe at the weſt end of the town. This truſty and well-choſen ambaſſador made choice of the one in Devonſhire-Place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo exactly did he anſwer the confidence repoſed in him, that he actually made, in Mr. Martindale's name, an agreement for the purchaſe of it; ſo that no farther trouble was impoſed on the old gentleman, than to ſign the bonds which were two days afterwards put into his hands. It is true that he ONCE accompanied the ladies to
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:030497_0047_0FE6F5C1DE2F9D88"/>
look at it; but was there a fault that he could poſſibly find with a houſe fit for the reception of any nobleman's family? Could any houſe be too good for Miſs Harvey? Could any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penditure that lay within the compaſs of Mr. Martindale's drafts, be extravagant?</p>
               <p>The furniture of his houſe in the city was to be the next conſideration. There was not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of it, neither was it ſufficiently modern to be tranſplanted into Devonſhire Place. The moſt faſhionable upholſterer in town was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore immediately applied to, and directed to change it <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> his fancy directed. He was to be allowed one thouſand pounds, over and above the value of what he took from the city; and of which he, as the moſt faſhionable, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the moſt conſcientious tradeſman, was to be ſole appraiſer. That furniture was not, as I obſerved, ſuited to the preſent taſte, but it was coſtly in the extreme; and was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually good, though not equally ornamental, in the inferior as in the beſt apartments. The late Mrs. Martindale's dreſſing-room was fitted up in the moſt expenſive manner; innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble were the rich ornaments it contained; the beautiful inlaid and Indian cabinets, the tall mandarians, and fine China jars, were not the moſt remarkable. The boxes belonging to her toilette were, like thoſe of the rich, but nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row-minded Lady S—, of ſilver inlaid with rubies; the bird-cages were of ſilver wire, and every article diſplayed <hi>grandeur,</hi> if not (according to modern ideas <hi>elegance.</hi> Some of theſe Miſs Harvey wiſhed to preſerve; till a
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:030497_0048_0FE6F5C30FA9C018"/>
gentle hint from her ſiſter reminded her, that as they had been the property of the late Mrs. Martindale, who had doubtleſs ſet a value on them beyond their intrinſic worth, it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that, if they were in <hi>her</hi> poſſeſſion, her ſon might wiſh to obtain them for Lady Jane to keep in remembrance of her. Nothing therefore was to be given into his hands, but a large portrait of his mother, with which he was to be favoured on his return to town; Miſs Harvey MODESTLY obſerving, that, conſcious of her own unworthineſs, ſhe ſhould fear a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val in that picture whenever Mr. Martindale looked at it, as he would naturally draw a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon between his two wives, which could not fail to be an unfortunate one to herſelf.</p>
               <p>The houſe was ſoon ready; the jewels, wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding clothes, and equipages, ſoon bought; and nothing remained but to fix the happy day, which ſoon arrived.

               <p>ON the morning preceding the day that was to make Mr. Martindale the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt or moſt miſerable of men, he perceived that an unuſual gloom overſpread the fine coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of his deſtined bride. He preſſed her hand to his lips, and entreated to be informed of the cauſe. She burſt into tears, and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly withdrew, leaving him and her ſiſter together.</p>
               <p>From HER, he anxiouſly prayed to know the meaning of ſo ſudden, ſo alarming a chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge; tenderly enquiring if he had left any thing undone by which it was poſſible for him to prove ſtill farther the extent of his affection. The emotion too viſible on every feature of his face, and the eagerneſs with which he conjured her to explain in what he had offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, forced at length, from this TENDER rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the avowal of a converſation her ſiſter had held with her; which amounted to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing nore than a childiſh idea that had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered her head; a kind of fear, that if ſhe was wretched enough to ſurvive Mr. Martindale, his ſon, unmindful of his father's tenderneſs might divert her of all his goodneſs had laviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on her. He might poſſibly in the end turn her out of her houſe, and take poſſeſſion of it,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:030497_0050_0FE6F5CD05F8DAB8"/>
as his heir. It was not (ſhe was very ſure) from any mercenary motive that her ſiſter had encouraged this thought; it was that of a young girl fund of magnificence as a child of a new toy, and like that, fearful of looſing it. This was a ſufficient hint for the too generous and too credulous Mr. Martindale; he ſent immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately for his attorney; and gave him inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to draw up a marriage ſettlement, by which he gave her the houſe in Devonſhire Place, with all its appendages; together with all the ready money he ſhould die poſſeſſed of, ſtocks, dividends, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. allotting only one thouſand pounds of it as a legacy to Mr. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tindale, or Lady Jane if ſhe ſurvived him; his landed property having been, as I before ſaid, already ſettled on his ſon.</p>
               <p>In a few hours all was ſigned, ſealed, and delivered; and he expreſſed his gratitude at be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing told how to remove the imaginary grief that had for a moment been ſuffered to prey on HER, to whoſe happineſs he was determined to devote the remainder of his exiſtence.</p>
               <p>The next morning the ſun ſhone reſplendent on the nuptials of Mr. Martindale. They were ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnized as agreed on in a private manner; and in the evening he conducted his bride to HER OWN houſe in Devonſhire Place.</p>
               <p>They had been there about a month, when Lady Jane and Mr. Martindale arrived in town. Mrs. Martindale had already formed the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of almoſt every faſhionable family
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:030497_0051_0FE6F5CD09DF4090"/>
there. For, as I have read in ſcripture, <hi>Wherever the honey is, there will the flies be alſo,</hi> ſo is an open houſe, a ſumptuous equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page, and all the other appendages of wealth, the ſure paſſport to an intimacy with the whole world. Innate virtue is no recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; nor is any other requiſite neceſſary to ſupport the appearance of it, than the acquieſc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a huſband to the conduct of his wife. However his delicacy may be wounded—how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his feelings may be hurt by her failings— let him but continue to live with her in a rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine of extravagant diſſipation, and the feeble voice of ſlander will be drowned in the loud plaudits of the world. But, if HE forſakes her, though ſhe be "as chaſte as ice, as pure as ſnow," ſhe ſhall not eſcape the torrent of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umny, which will inevitably overwhelm her reputation. A woman's fame depends leſs on her own character, than it does on that of her huſband. If he diſcards her, the world will alſo, without enquiring why he has done ſo.— She will look for friends, but ſhe will never find them. The gay companions of youthful plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures will ſhrink from diſtreſs, as from a peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; and ſhe will woefully experience, that the fine day, <hi>Flattery,</hi> will not ſtay to aſſiſt the weary in a cloudy night. Alas! HER day will ſoon ſet in darkneſs—her breaking heart will be overwhelmed by the ſtorms of adverſity, until in ſome obſcure corner of the earth ſhe dies unknown—unpitied—and unlamented!</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIV</head>
               <p>MRS. Martindale ſoon gained a complete aſcendancy over her doting huſband, which was ſtrengthened by her apparent attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Lady Jane, who continued to be ſo great a favourite with him, that her ſanction ſeemed neceſſary to every thing ſhe undertook. She had art enough to twiſt herſelf round the heart of that lady, who repoſed in her an unlimited confidence, and they became inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable. They met with univerſal admiration; but their manners were ſo different, that the admirer of the one was ſeldom that of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Mrs. Martindale's beauty and levity attracted the notice of all the gay men, while Lady Jane's increaſing ſenſibility gave her an air of <hi>froideur,</hi> that forbade them every hope-of encouragement.</p>
               <p>Mr. Martindale, ſenior, though extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant in the gratification of his wife's plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, was not wholly unmindful of his ſon's intereſts. He purchaſed a ſmall houſe for him in Argyle Street, to which he was prompted by his wife</p>
               <p>Lady Jane believed her to be only the art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, giddy girl ſhe appeared. Little did ſhe
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:030497_0053_0FE6F5CE1AC10790"/>
ſuſpect the ſnake ſhe was foſtering in her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, which waited only with envenomed ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour to ſting her beyond the reach of human remedies.</p>
               <p>Among the crowd of fluctuating admirers that paid their devotions at the ſhrine of beauty, Lord Darnley was the moſt conſpicuous for his attentions to Mrs. Martindale. He was lately married to a very young lady, whoſe large fortune had been in part appropriated to the payment of his lordſhip's early debts. He was fond of his wife, yet not ſufficiently ſo to lay any embargo on his inclinations whenever they led him to indulge a momentary caprice.</p>
               <p>He conſidered Mrs. Martindale an eaſy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, which, when once obtained, would be ſoon forgotten. With this view he laid cloſe ſiege to her at every public place ſhe frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; nor did ſhe give his lordſhip any reaſon to doubt the ſucceſs of his enterpriſe. Vanity was her ruling paſſion, and to that ſhe was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ready to ſacrifice every moral conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Lady Jane either did not, or would not perceive this growing intimacy; ſhe conceived Mrs. Martindale's levity to be her beſt ſecurity againſt any attachment of the heart, and ſhe felt no alarms on her account.</p>
               <p>Lord Darnley was rather an elegant than a handſome man. Perfectly verſed in every leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of LOVE, he had ſeldom met with a denial where he had once taken the pains to ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate himſelf. He was at this time buſily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:030497_0054_0FE6F5D9B52FA578"/>
in raiſing a regiment of light dragoons for the ſervice of his country; and a deſire of rendering himſelf conſpicuous according with his notions of patriotiſm, he ſpared no expence to complete it. Seldom a day paſſed in which his emiſſaries did not inveigle new victims to ſatiate the rapacious thirſt of ruthleſs war! His lordſhip, equally a candidate for the fields of Mars and of Venus, divided his time between both. His morning hours were devoted to the miſery and ruin of many poor and worthy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies; his evening ones to the more pleaſing amuſement of endeavouring to ſeduce the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of any woman, to whom he might wiſh for the moment to render himſelf agreeable. Not that I mean to infer, that Lord Darnley was a bad man, he was only a faſhionable one. Nurſed in the lap of luxury by a moſt indulgent mother, his earlieſt wiſhes had not been left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratified. He had been returned from the continent about two years, where his extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance was ſo unbounded, that it became neceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary to recall him; and he had been married, one year, to the amiable lady before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Martindale was elated by Lord Darn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley's attention to her. Her eyes ſought him every where, and he perceived it; nor was it long before an opportunity offered, that, in making him maſter of her perſon, baniſhed the ſlender impreſſion ſhe had made on his mind. He met with little or no reſiſtance when he hinted at a private aſſignation; which being fixed, and effected at the houſe of her conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient,
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:030497_0055_0FE6F5D9B900E928"/>
milliner, paſſed without ſuſpicion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong her attendants.</p>
               <p>Lord Darnley was no ſooner a happy lover, than he was a ſatiated one. He had never ſeen any woman but Lady Darnley for whom he had conceived a ſentiment beyond that of momentary paſſion; and had ſhe not been his wife, it is moſt probable that in her alone, all his inclinations would have centered; but how ſtrange is, it that every thing loſes a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its value from the moment we have an indiſputeable claim on it! The virtuous Lady Darnley, who had not a particle of coquetry in her diſpoſition, had married the man of her choice, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or had ſhe a wiſh equal to that of pleaſing him. We might be led to ſuppoſe from the remark I have juſt made (and from that only), that had he been more ſteady in his conduct towards her, ſhe might have been more indifferent. She knew that he had er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, but ſhe did not know the extent of them; and ſhe fondly hoped, that her unremiting at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to his happineſs, and conſtant properi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of conduct, would at length overcome them. She knew Lady Jane, and Mrs. Martindale, by report only; her approaching confinement, which ſhe expected every hour, keeping her conſtantly at home, without other ſociety than her mother, who was come for the firſt time in her life to London, for the purpoſe of attending her at that trying moment.</p>
               <p>When the newſpapers announced Lady Darnley's delivery, Mrs. Martindale pleaſed
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:030497_0056_0FE6F5DB4726EAD8"/>
herſelf with the idea of monopolizing his lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's conſtant attendance; and having menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned to her huſband the polite attentions that Lady Jane and herſelf had received from him, ſignified her intention of ſending him a card for the next evening ſhe ſhould receive company, and of introducing his lordſhip to his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. To this no objection could be made, and Mrs. Martindale took an early opportunity of diſpatching invitations to ſeveral of her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, among whom Lord Darnley was not forgotten.</p>
               <p>Lady Jane, who had no ſuſpicion of what had paſſed, and who really liked Lord Darn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, though ſhe had not particularly appeared to do ſo, was glad of this opportunity of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mr. James Martindale acquainted with him alſo; and of becoming by theſe means known to Lady Darnley, when her confinement ſhould be over.</p>
               <p>Mrs Martindale's aſſembly was brilliant in the extreme; for ſhe had been very particular on that occaſion, and had herſelf ſelected from her viſiting-book, ſuch names as ſtood foremoſt in the gaudy catalogue of rank.</p>
               <p>At the appointed hour, ſhe ſaw her rooms fill to her heart's ſatisfaction, but in vain ſhe looked for Lord Darnley!—She grew inat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to her viſitors, walked ſucceſſively thro' the rooms, and looked continually at her watch, which ſhe fancied loſt <hi>time.</hi> ſhe could not account for his abſence. It was on HIS ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:030497_0057_0FE6F5DB4CDF5D48"/>
ſhe had that evening aſſembled all that was moſt faſhionable in town, and had ſtudied to raiſe her conſequence by the ſelection of her company; yet he was the only perſon who did not appear. At eleven, the party began to diſperſe; the ducheſs of G—and her love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly daughters were juſt taking their leave, when Lord Darnley was announced.</p>
               <p>The ſudden appearance of the ſun breaking through the thick clouds of a miſty morning, could not convey a more genial warmth to the dew-damp traveller, than did the ſight of Lord Darnley to Mrs. Martindale; her eyes bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened as ſhe led him towards Mr. Martindale, who received him with the utmoſt politeneſs. But the electrical ſhock of mortification inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſucceeded, when, in a voice ſcarcely arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate, he enquired for Lady Jane. There was an air of ſorrow and confuſion in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, that it was not poſſible for her to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtrue. Mrs. Martindale had more pride than love; and with a haughty ſneer turning haſtily from him, ſhe informed his lordſhip, that ſhe had laſt ſeen Lady Jane at cards in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining room. He immediately went there. The party had juſt broke up, and ſhe was ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near the door (waiting for Mr. Martindale, who was gone to enquire for the carriage), when Lord Darnley approached her. He took her hand, with a freedom ſhe had never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in him, and in a faltering voice whiſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—OH LADY JANE, IN YOU I HOPE TO FIND A FRIEND!—Struck at his appearance, which indicated a ſenſibility of which ſhe had
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:030497_0058_0FE6F5E7AB218100"/>
not hitherto ſuppoſed him capable, ſhe eagerly aſked, what could have thus affected him? The tears ruſhed into his eyes, and he could only ſay "Lady Darnley"—as Mr. Martindale informed her their carriage was up. She return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed haſtily to wiſh Mrs. Martindale good-night; introduced Mr. James Martindale to Lord Darnley, who handed her into it, and they parted for the night.</p>

               <p>LORD Darnley did not return up ſtairs, but deſiring that his ſervants might be called, threw himſelf into the carriage, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it home. His heart was affected, and for once he ſacrificed the rules of politeneſs to its feelings. When he arrived there, he flew to Lady Darnley's apartment, without having ſpoken to any one; but alas! little did he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the ſcene that awaited him; He knocked gently at the door, fearful of diſturbing her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: but receiving no anſwer, he opened it. The curtains were all undrawn. On one ſide of the bed, he ſaw her mother graſping her hands; on the other, the nurſe was chafing her temple with har ſhorn;—but ſhe, alas, was gone for ever!—A moment convinced him of the fatal truth; the next that ſucceeded it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived him of his ſenſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="unknown:030497_0059_0FE6F5E7AF05A4B8"/>It was on the ninth-day after Lady Darn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley's delivery of her firſt child. Some unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable ſymptoms had appeared in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but they were not ſufficiently ſo to alarm the phyſicians, or nurſe, of any immediate dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Yet a fatal preſentiment had taken poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of Lord Darnley from the firſt hour ſince her lying-in; and this was ſtrengthened by ſome oblique, yet gentle hints that had been given him by the angle of purity herſelf; who had unfortunately ſtopped her cariage one morning by accident at the door of Mrs. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tindale's milliner, where ſhe bought ſome things, and gave a card, with orders that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhould be ſent to her. The officious Frenchwoman told her, that ſhe was ſure ſhe muſt be beholden to Lord Darnly, or Mrs. Martindale, for the honour of her ladyſhips cuſtom, as ſhe was that lady's milliner, and had frequently ſeen his lordſhip at her houſe.</p>
               <p>I do not believe that this French milliner (or indeed any other milliner) could plead igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in ſuch a ſituation. She could not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that Lord Darnley (whoſe name had been mentioned to her by Mrs. Martindale) had met that lady there ſecretly, and in a private room, for any good purpoſe. No. But the diſcovery of the intrigue to Lady Darnley might prove in the end beneficial to her, and ſhe was not of a nature to reflect on the delicate feelings of <hi>a woman of honour.</hi> Theſe, were therefore to be ſacrificed to her own mercenary and barbarous diſpoſition; and ſhe planted a thorn in the breaſt of that ſpotleſs lady; it feſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:030497_0060_0FE6F5E8CFD200C8"/>
there, and was her companion to the grave.</p>
               <p>Lady Darnley had a few days after the birth of her child, which was a daughter, moſt earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtly implored her lord to promiſe her that he would never neglect this only pledge of their love. She conjured him to cheriſh her for her mother's ſake; as ſhe had imbibed, ſhe ſaid a ſtrange idea, that her FIRST child would be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo her LAST. She gently added (ſqueezing his hand, and convulſed almoſt with agony as ſhe ſpoke), that ſhe hoped he would in future point out to her a better example than the Mrs. Martindale whom ſhe had never ſeen, but of whom ſhe had heard MORE than ſhe thought proper to reveal to him, till after her recovery. Lord Darnley with truth declared, that he had never been in Mrs. Martindale's houſe; that he had only formed a ſlight acquaintance with her at different public places; but he did not mention the French milliner, nor any other circumſtance that could tend to corroborate their intimacy.</p>
               <p>On the day that he received Mrs. Martin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale's card, he was half inclined to ſhew it La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Darnley; but her weak health and ſpirits prevented him. Yet he had no juſt ground to ſuſpect her approaching diſſolution. Her phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians had not, as I ſaid, even hinted at danger and if his mind was painfully awake to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of it, he could impute it only to thoſe fears which a timid ſuperſtition, and not reality, had induced him to give way to. He
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:030497_0061_0FE6F5E8D4430300"/>
told her that he was engaged to an aſſembly that evening, but he did not ſay where; and his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance was ſo numerous, that without the help of the milliner, or ſome of her confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, Lady Darnley could not have ſuſpected it to be at Mrs. Martindale's ſhe however DID ſuſpect it, and received private intelligence of that lady's houſe being open the ſame evening, and that Lord Darnley's carriage made one of the number at her door.</p>
               <p>When the meſſenger who was ſent to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the truth of this unwelcome news returned from executing his commiſſion, Lady Darnley inſiſted on ſeeing him; nor could the tender entreaties of her mother prevent her from diving into the truth. Her diſorder (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable from her ſituation) had that day taken a turn, and marked her death as certain; ſhe received the information of it with all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude that a mind already waſted to heaven could experience. She deſired that Lord Darn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley might be immediately ſent for; and her footman, eager to obey the orders of his much-loved lady, haſtened on the wings of anxiety to meet his lord. But when he reached De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonſhire Place, he heard only that he had been there for a very ſhort time, and was returned. Lord Darnley was at home a few minutes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his ſervant; but it was already too late for him to catch the expiring breath of his lovely, his virtuous, his already ſainted wife!</p>
               <p>His grief became unbounded; he kiſſed her pale lips, and invoked the God of Heaven to
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:030497_0062_0FE6F5ECD6B8C5C0"/>
witneſs the integrity of his heart!—He had been guilty of errors, he felt he had, of fatal ones; but little did he imagine what would be their dreadful conſequences; for, in the firſt paroxſyms of phrenſy, he condemned himſelf as being the ſole author of her death. He or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his little girl to be brought into the room, and kiſſed her with an enthuſiaſtic and fervent affection. He joined her little face to that of her ſenſeleſs mother; and pointed out each reſembling feature. It was a ſolemn, an aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſcene; and he was at length forced out of the room; his expreſſions of grief becoming ſo violent, as to threaten with injury his own health.</p>
               <p>Lord Darnley would not be told, nor ſuffer himſelf to reflect, that an over delicate conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution had ſoon ſurrendered itſelf to a malady, which was ſo powerful as to baffle every effort of art. To this was to be imputed Lady Darn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley's early death. His feeling heart taught him firſt to conſider his own miſconduct; and he alternately upbraided his child, and himſelf, as the authors of their irreparable loſs.</p>

               <p>MRS. Martindale ſeldom or ever took up a newſpaper; and a cold (of which ſhe made the moſt) had confined her for ſome days at home; during which ſhe did not ſee Lady Jane, who was gone to paſs a week at Oxford, on a viſit to one of Mr. Martindale's brother collegians.</p>
               <p>On the evening of their return, they went to Devonſhire Place, and ſtaid ſupper. Mrs. Martindale appointed two o'clock the next day to call on Lady Jane, as they were to go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to beſpeak dreſſes for the enſuing maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querade.</p>
               <p>When Mrs. Martindale arrived in Argyle Street, ſhe found Lady Jane in tears; who told her that Mr. Martindale was juſt gone out to enquire into the truth of a para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph they had obſerved in <hi>The World,</hi> which mentioned Lady Darnley's death. They did not however wait his return, but ſtopped into the carriage as ſoon as it arrived, ordering the coachman to drive ſlowly towards Cavendiſh Square; and to ſtop, if he ſaw his maſter. At the entrance of it, they were met by a hearſe, adorned with white plumes and eſcutcheons,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:030497_0064_0FE6F5F55EBEFCA8"/>
and followed by many coaches and weeping at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants. The footman's enquiries were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by the name of <hi>Lady Darnley.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lady Jane let down the fore-glaſs, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the coachman to return; but Mrs. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tindale deſired that he might firſt proceed to Donnelly's in Taviſtock Street; having no idea, ſhe ſaid, of being diſappointed of her maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querade dreſs, becauſe Lady Darnley (a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man whom ſhe had never ſeen) was dead. Lady Jane endeavoured as much as poſſible to conceal her grief; fearing to expreſs even a ſentiment of pity, leſt it ſhould be conſtrued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one of love, for a man for whom ſhe had hitherto felt nothing more than a ſiſterly affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion: but whoſe preſent misfortune was in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſufficient to intereſt a heart poſſeſſed of leſs exquiſite feelings than her own.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Martindale ordered a Turkiſh habit. Lady Jane did not order any thing. She ſhould be contented, ſhe ſaid, to appear as an humble attendant on the fair Grecian, not having at that time ſpirits to encounter the wit of the different characters ſhe ſhould meet with there.</p>
               <p>They returned to Argyle Street, and parted at the door. Mr. Martindale was at home, expecting Lady Jane. He perceived her me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, and enquired its cauſe. She can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly told him, that Lady Darnley's ſudden death, and the funeral which ſhe had met, had <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>commonly affected her. She was engaged, ſhe ſaid, to a party going that evening to the
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:030497_0065_0FE6F5F563877D50"/>
Ducheſs of G—'s, but ſhe found herſelf unequal to it, and was going to ſend a card of apology. This ſhe did, and they paſſed the remainder of the day in a domeſtic, but not a very cheerful tête-átête.</p>
               <p>The next morning, while Mr. Martindale was out, a ſervant of Lord Darnley brought a note from him to Lady Jane, requeſting that he might be permitted to wait on her for a few minutes, if ſhe was alone and diſengaged. His ſituation precluded the poſſibility of a denial, had ſhe not even wiſhed to ſee him. There is an undeſcribable pleaſure attendant only on minds ſuſceptible of fine feelings, in liſtening to a tale of woe, and ſympathizing with the pathetic narrator. Lord Darnley, the happy and the acknowledged admirer of Mrs. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tindale, had not excited in Lady Jane any alarming ſenſation; but Lord Darnley miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſelecting HER as a friend in his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, might become a dangerous compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>In leſs than half an hour, Lord Darnley was in Argyle Street. Lady Jane gave orders that no perſon ſhould be admitted, and was almoſt equally affected with himſelf. He took this opportunity to unboſom himſelf to her. He ſaid, that whatever might be the ſentiments of his heart towards her, he conſidered that in his preſent ſituation, and her own, an avowal of them would be a violation of decency <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

her quiet home!—But the intercourſe of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip was not to be prohibited, and he felt THAT of Lady Jane was neceſſary for the preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his exiſtance; which he valued only for the ſake of the hapleſs infant that had ſurvived its mother. He then lamented in the moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting manner the fatal error of a moment, that had tempted him to beſtow a thought on the DISSIPATED, the UNPRINCIPLED <hi>Mrs. Martindale!</hi>—(Here Lady Jane gazed on him with aſtoniſhment.)—He hoped, he ſaid, that her generous heart would inſtruct her to pardon a connection into which he had been inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently drawn, at the ſame time that (he could not help owning it) ſhe alone was the object of his reſpect and admiration; and that it would teach her to feel for a man who had NOW a claim on her pity, but who had hitherto deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved her utmoſt contempt. He then told her of the converſation he had held, with Lady Darnley, ſoon after her lying-in, and among the number of his confeſſions, the French mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liner was not forgotten.</p>
               <p>Lady Jane was too much confuſed by what ſhe had heard, to know in what manner to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to him. She had too high an opinion of his <hi>honour</hi> to doubt his <hi>word</hi>; yet ſhe could not have ſuppoſed that Mrs. Martindale would have carried her imprudence beyond what ſhe had conceived to be an unmeaning levity. Yet how neceſſary did it appear to her at this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for an entire explanation to take place, when Lord Darnley implored her pardon for having dared to ſurmiſe that ſhe had been the
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:030497_0067_0FE6F5FE5D3EA9F0"/>
confidante of that vile woman; who had not ſcrupled to declare to him, that Lady Jane had admited more than one favoured lover; but that her regard and pity for both Mr. Martin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dales had prevented her hitherto divulging what in the courſe of time could not fail to be publicly known.</p>
               <p>Lady Jane could not without the moſt poig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant emotion here that her fair ſame had been traduced; and by the woman too who ſhould have been the firſt to defend it. How cruel, how deſperate was her condition! for, while Lord Darnley was ſpeaking, ſhe recollected having obſerved that ſeveral of her female ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance had latterly behaved towards her with uncommon reſerve<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> although no one had been friendly enough to intimate in what ſhe had offended. But ſhe had not ſuffered it at the time to make any great impreſſion on her; as ſhe was perfectly conſcious of her innocence, and attributed it only to ſome trivial cauſe, with which ſhe might poſſibly hereafter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come acquainted.</p>
               <p>But now ſhe felt mortified indeed! She found that Lord Darnley had been the FIRST perſon prejudiced againſt her, and ſhe could have wiſhed it to be the reverſe. In HIS eyes, ſhe wanted to appear perfect She knew not how to exculpate herſelf from calumnies ſo at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocious, nor how to convince Lord Darnley of the falſehood of her accuſer. She entreated his lordſhip to make allowances for the agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into which his diſcourſe had thrown her, as
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:030497_0068_0FE6F5FF9E0DEC88"/>
an apology for the little ſhe could at that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment urge in her juſtification; ſhe requeſted his advice how to act, and inwardly reſolved, let what would be the conſequence, to abide by it. She begged he would direct her how to proceed in a matter of ſuch importance to the peace of the whole family; obſerving that ſhe was too inexperienced to judge for herſelf; and that in conſequence of the avowal he had made, ſhe conceived him to be the only perſon who was able (or who indeed might be willing) to adviſe her.</p>
               <p>He told her, that he ſaw no alternative be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a ſeparation taking place among them all, or her eternal ſilence on the ſubject. He beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for God's ſake that ſhe would not expoſe herſelf to farther inſults and mortifications; but that ſhe would ſuffer herſelf to be wholly adviſed by him, and continue to live as before: at the ſame time he exacted a promiſe from her, that ſhe would immediately acquaint him by letter, ſhould any now manoeuvres of Mrs. Martindale's intervene, to render the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of her treachery unavoidable.</p>
               <p>Lady Jane promiſed faithfully to adhere to all he ſaid, he then entreated her to honour his little girl ſometimes with her attention. He was going he ſaid to let his houſe in Cavendiſh Square, and to ſend her with her nurſe to that of a gardener at Liſſon-Green, near Paddington, in whoſe wife he could confide. She was to remain there ſome time, as he was going out of town the next day, to paſs a few months at
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:030497_0069_0FE6F6DD155B3578"/>
the head quarters of his regiment. He then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe to take his leave of Lady Jane; gave her the child's direction; and reſpectfully, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitately withdrew.</p>
               <p>Lady Jane was no ſooner alone, than ſhe gave vent to her oppreſſed heart. But Lord Darnley had enjoined on her the hardeſt taſk poſſible to a generous mind, that of diſſimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſhe ſaw herſelf for the firſt time obliged to practiſe it. She was compelled therefore to command her feelings, and to endeavour to compoſe her appearance. Her heart was to become the ſole repoſitory of thoſe cares, which, alas! ſhe had not a friend to divide.</p>
               <p>When Mr. Martindale returned home, he ironically aſked Lady Jane, whom ſhe had ſeen?—She mentioned Lord Darnley's viſit, but in her confuſion omitted telling him of his requeſt that ſhe ſhould ſometimes ſee his child. He obſerved that her eyes were red with weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but how, he ſaid, could it be otherwiſe, while ſhe made Lord Darnley's griefs her own? She began to excuſe herſelf; he ſcarcely deigned to anſwer her, and withdrew to his apartment.</p>
               <p>Several weeks paſſed without any change taking place. Lady Jane often pondered on the extraordinary confeſſion that had been made her; but ſhe ſtrictly fulfilled her promiſe, and buried her ſecret within her <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

She was even ſo generous in her ſentiments as in THAT ERROR of Mrs. Martindale's to find an excuſe for her cruelty towards herſelf. She knew that it was impoſſible for ſo young and ſo beautiful a woman to be fond of a huſband who was old enough to be her grandfather; and ſhe was convinced that it proceeded ſolely from a jealouſy that had ariſen in conſequence of the love ſhe bore Lord Darnley. The more ſhe reflected on HIS advanatges, the leſs ſhe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at the choice Mrs. Martindale had made.</p>

               <p>MR. Martindale became overbearing, and was at times even inſolent to Lady Jane. She was no longer in HIS opinion the amiable <hi>Contraſt</hi> to Mrs. Martindale; he conceived her virtues to diminiſh, and her beauties to decay. Yet he was the only one who ſuſpected either, or who had at leaſt dared to ſay ſo. I ſhould indeed except Mrs. Martindale; who not only viewed her with the eye of hatred, but who alſo became indefatigable in her endeavours to poiſon the mind both of the old gentleman and his ſon againſt her. Yet ſhe took her meaſures ſo artfully, that Lady Jane had no reaſon to ſuppoſe ſhe ever held any private converſation with them about her.</p>
               <p>They were one evening at the Ducheſs of G—'s, and Lady Jane was particularly ſtruck with the appearance of a young lady, who never ceaſed to look at her. She enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her name, and found that it was <hi>Miſs Stuart.</hi> She requeſted another lady to introduce them to each other, and particularly aſked after the Colonel. She would have added another name to his, but her reſolution forſook her. A far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acquaintance was mutually propoſed, and accepted, and Mr. Martindale waited on Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel

Stuart, at his lodgings in Cumberland-ſtreet, the next day. But he did not condeſcended to inform Lady Jane at his return of what had paſſed there, neither did he once mention the name of <hi>Glencairn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In a few days Lady Jane paid a morning viſit to Miſs Stuart, having left a card there the preceding evening. She was admitted, and found that lovely girl ſitting at a frame for em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidery. Glencairn was reading to her, and the Colonel was examining different charts which lay on the table. Lady Jane coloured. Glencairn was viſibly agitated, and inſtantly turning to the Colonel, ſolicited him to walk out; to which the other aſſenting, they ſoon diſappeared.</p>
               <p>Miſs Stuart, with the freedom of youth and innocence, gave Lady Jane a long account of her travels, which were, ſhe ſaid, pathetically ended by her witneſſing the ſolemn ſcene of her friend Miſs Beaumont's renunciation of this life, to purſue, according to her own ideas, the ſureſt road to happineſs in the next.</p>
               <p>They were talking over this, and other matters, when the poſtman's knock announced letters; and a ſervant delivered one to Miſs Stuart, which Lady Jane entreated her to read without ceremony. She ſaid it was from Miſs Beaumont (whoſe name was changed to mother Saint Etienne), congratulating herſelf and family on their ſafe return to England, and lamenting the probability that exiſted of
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:030497_0073_0FE6F5FFA418A578"/>

                     <p>The only point, my dear Miſs Stuart, on which we could ever diſagree during our long reſidence together in this peaceful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, was that of my ſecluſion from the world. When I declared to you that my reſolution was fixed on taking the veil, how many dangerous objections did you not hold out to me, in hopes to alter the ſettled pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of my heart! You invited me to live with you, and moſt tenderly aſſured me, that no future change in your ſituation ſhould be able to effect one in your ſentiments towards me. Nor was this the only allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you placed before me. Alas! you em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed a more dangerous one ſtill, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to unite the duties of religion and worldly affection. You went ſo far as to aſſure me, that my ſacrifice would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God himſelf; who, you ſay, ſent us into this world for the benefit of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety; ſo that we have no more right to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract ourſelves from it, than we have to lay down our life when we are weary of it. The world, you told me, abounds with pure and ſocial delights; but they can be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enjoyed by thoſe who hold an intercourſe with it. Yet have you not ſometimes, my dear friend, inadvertently owned to me that you are not happy?—And if YOU, formed

by nature for all its bleſſings, are not ſo, how can you imagine that I, a ſtranger even in idea, ſhould be willing to renounce for it a way of life that I have been taught to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve is preferable to every other? You went ſo far as to aſſure me, that your heart has made its choice, and unfortunately fixed itſelf where it has no hope of return. That the only man to whom you could wiſh to unite yourſelf is, as you have every reaſon to believe, attached elſewhere; and that you ſuſpect, from the hints he has given, that the object of his love is—<hi>married!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Would not this idea, my dear Miſs Stuart, rather frighten a young novice from the world, than encourage her to enter it?—I have read of love, though I never felt its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence; and I am thankful that I have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the inclination nor the power to add one to its numberleſs victims.</p>

               <p>Lady Jane peruſed this part of the letter with particular emotion; ſhe too ſurely gueſſed that it alluded to Glencairn and herſelf, of which ſhe was fully convinced when Miſs Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>art aſked her <hi>What ſhe thought of Glencairn?</hi> This queſtion, which might not have paſſed for ſingular, had it not been accompanied with an uneaſy air of conſtraint that denoted an over anxious curioſity, ſuffuſed Lady Jane's coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance with conſcious bluſhes, that did not eſcape the penetrating eyes of Miſs Stuart. Each had ſpoken ſufficiently plain to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the other, that neither was ſatisfied.
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:030497_0075_0FE6F6075F7E0AD0"/>
Lady Jane's ſilence and viſible embarraſſment were as expreſſive as could be the moſt eloquent language. The letter had thrown them into a ſtate of uneaſy perplexity; it had diſturbed their peace, and was from that moment the ſubject to both of many painful reflections.</p>
               <p>Lady Jane frequently met Glencairn; and ſhe could not perceive without emotion, and ſorrow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the tender langour that clouded his fine countenance; conſidering as ſhe did, that his attachment to her was the ſole cauſe of it. Her heart ſeemed divided between him and Lord Darnley. She was unconſcious of giving the preference to either, and ſhe indulged the pure ſentiments of innocent affection for both. Mrs. Martindale was continually fabricating tales to her diſadvantage; ſhe repreſented Lord Darn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley to her acquaintance as an unprincipled li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertine, who had taken an advantage of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction ſhe had given him in her houſe, and had endeavoured by hints too plain to be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtrued, to ſeduce her affections from it. She ſincerely wiſhed, ſhe ſaid, that Lady Jane might not be deceived in the more favourable opinion ſhe had formed of him; for ſhe intimat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that her ladyſhip entertained a very high one. Mrs. Martindale did not openly inveigh againſt her, for that might have led to a conviction of the truth; but ſhe wounded her under the maſk of apparent regard; and while ſhe flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and careſſed her, ſhe murdered her repoſe, and meditated her final deſtruction.</p>

               <p>THESE ladies continued to be as much together as formerly, and time appeared to have almoſt obliterated the remembrance of Lord Darnley, when a circumſtance interfered-that was laudable in its cauſe, but moſt pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in its effect. Lady Jane had as I before obd<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſerved) neglected mentioning to her huſband the promiſe ſhe had made him, of ſometimes viſiting his daughter. Her time had indeed been ſo much taken up with other engagements, that ſhe had not yet found a leiſure hour to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to it. She however one morning felt a ſtrong inclination to ſee the child; ordered the carriage, and went to Paddington. She found the little cherub looking perfectly well, and ſtaid with it above an hour. She then deſired the nurſe would make Miſs Darnley, and her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ready to accompany her; that ſhe would take them for an airing a little farther on the road, and ſet them down on her return.</p>
               <p>They had not proceeded half a mile, before they were met by Mrs. Martindale's carriage, who was in it, with her old man. They both ſtopped; and Mrs. Martindale, giving a ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant look at her huſband, obſerved, <hi>How extreamly odd it was, that they ſhould meet by accident on the ſame road.</hi> Her eyes were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:030497_0077_0FE6F60B79ECBC40"/>
directed to the nurſe and child; and both of them appearing in deep mourning, did not leave a doubt who they were. She propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their returning in Lady Jane's coach, and ſending back their own; which was complied with. Her motive for doing this, was to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover where the child lived. But in that ſhe was diſappointed; Lady Jane having determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at that moment to take it to Argyle-ſtreet. She therefore ordered the coachman to drive there, telling the nurſe ſhe would ſend them ſafe back in the evening.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as ſhe returned home, ſhe ſent the nurſe into the Steward's room, and, taking the child in her arms, went into Mr. Martin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale's dreſſing-room, and begged leave to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce a ſtranger to his acquaintance, the infant daughter of Lord Darnley. She ſaid this with a viſible confuſion, which aroſe in conſequence of feeling herſelf obliged to relate the circumſtance of meeting Mr. and Mrs. Martindale, without which it was poſſible for him to ſurmiſe that he would not have been informed of her viſit. He took but little no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the ſmileing girl, who was in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reconducted with her nurſe, to the place of their deſtination.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIX.</head>
               <p>THE gentle Miſs Stuart became every day more attached to Glencairn, while Mr. Coutenay, an intimate acquaintance of her father's, was as paſſionately in love with her. Mr. Courtenay was a gentleman of Ireland, of conſiderable fortune, but deſcended from an obſcure family, and many years older than Miſs. Stuart. Yet ſuch was the nature of Mary, that theſe diſadvantages, had even the want of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney been annexed to them, would have been no impediment to her union with him, had her father wiſhed it, and her affections been diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged. But ſhe cheriſhed the flatterer, Hope. She believed all that it ſuggeſted, and ſhe real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thought that ſhe ſhould yet ſee the day, when Glencairn would renounce his attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of which ſhe was no longer uncertain as to the object. Alas! the roſes began once more to fade on her lavely cheek; her ſpirits gradually forſook her; and her father, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving both, at length tenderly queſtioned her. He mentioned Glencairn, and entreated to be informed of the ſituation of her mind, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him.</p>
               <p>Miſs Stuart's heart repoſed on the boſom of this indulgent father; ſhe acknowledged to him
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:030497_0079_0FE6F612F80CF020"/>
her attachment for Glencairn; but ſhe aſſured him, that ſhe poſſeſſed too much pride ever to ſuffer that attachment to overcome her reaſon. She had obſerved an indifference in his manner towards her, that had conſiderably augmented ſince their return to England; and ſhe was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined rather to ſacrifice her peace for ever, than to conſent, were he even to urge it, to owe the happineſs of being his, to a ſentiment of pity oniy, with which ſhe might inſpire him. Glencairn's heart was, ſhe was well aſſured, devoted to another. She did not wiſh to diſavow that <hi>he</hi> alone would ever remain the object of her moſt ſervent affections; but ſhe would never owe the gratification of indulging them to the chance that deprived him of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing that more fortunate woman, and to a ſentiment that muſt render her acceptance of him deſpicable in her own eyes, and ſtill more ſo in her father's.</p>
               <p>Sentiments ſuch as theſe could not fail to ſtrengthen in Colonel Stuart, that opinion of his lovely daughter, which had hitherto fallen little ſhort of adoration. He coincided in all ſhe ſaid, and gloried in the accompliſhment of his wiſhes. For what wiſh could be ſo dear to him, as that of ſeeing his Mary, though ſtruggling with ſtrong paſſions, heroic enough to ſubdue them? He preſſed her to his boſom, and aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, that he preferred her happineſs to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry worldly conſideration; but that there was <hi>one</hi> beyond the limits of this life, which hung heavy on his mind. He alluded to the period of his own exiſtance, which from the courſe of
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:030497_0080_0FE6F617372CB5C8"/>
nature, and his own habitual complaints, was not likely to be prolonged many years. To ſee his Mary ſettled, was to enſure a happy termination of his days; to leave her without a protector, would embitter his laſt moments, the approach of which he wiſhed to meet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a pang, as they haſtened him to a re-union with her angelic mother!</p>
               <p>As he uttered the laſt ſentence, the tears quivered in his expreſſive eyes, and gently for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced their paſſage down his venerable cheeks. Mary felt the weight of his argument, but could not command reſolution enough to ſay ſhe would accept the thrice-proffered hand of Mr. Courtenay: ſhe conjured the Colonel never to mention the ſubject of their converſation to any one; and ſhe ſtill hoped, ſhe ſaid, that ſhe might be at length enabled to eradicate from her mind thoſe ideas which ſhe had hitherto ſo raſhly and ſo fondly entertained. But ſhe did not tell him ALL ſhe thought; her heart had made its election, and ſhe knew that every en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour would be vain to contend againſt it. She inwardly determined to cheriſh the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Glencairn, and, leaving the chance of their future union to himſelf, ſhe in ſecret reſolved never to enter into an engagement that might on her ſide impede it.</p>
               <p>It was impoſſible for Glencairn to be ignor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant of the attachment he had inſpired, neither did he attempt to appear ſo. He deeply la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented it, and, with a candour ſeldom practiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among elegant young men, he aſſured Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:030497_0081_0FE6F6173B860598"/>
Stuart that his friendſhip for the lovely Mary exceeded even the bounds of brotherly love. He wiſhed, he ſaid, for the ſake of his own peace, and he believed he might with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vanity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> include that of Mary alſo, that his heart had not been entangled in a fatal at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment, from whence he was never likely to derive a hope of happineſs; he added, that he had too delicate a ſenſe of honour to offer her his hand, while he had not a heart to beſtow with it. Miſs Stuart, he juſtly obſerved, merited the firſt offerings of the pureſt. How could he propoſe to make her wretched, by endeavouring to unite her to a man who had it not in his power to forget another; and for whom his love was ſo criminal, that at the ſame time he owned it to his friend, he felt a degree of remorſe at leaſt equal to it?</p>
               <p>Colonel Stuart ſincerely pitied, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſooth him, for he too had once felt the force of an irreſiſtible attachment. He propoſed their immediately returning to Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, where time, diſtance from the beloved object, and the growing affections of Mary, might poſſibly lead him to a recovery of his reaſon. Alas," replied Glencairn,
<q>how can I expect the countenance of your too gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous regard? Were I to return with you to that ſeat of innocence and virtue, ſhould I not inſult the feelings of your angelic daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? Sould I not carry with me there the wound that <hi>Lady Jane Martindale</hi> has made in my peace?—Yes, my dear Sir, you are entitled to my confidence, and you ſhall
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:030497_0082_0FE6F622B6B69780"/>
wholly poſſeſs it. It was <hi>ſhe</hi> who firſt inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me with love; to <hi>her</hi> I am determined to devote my exiſtence; and for her ſake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, I will forego the happineſs that flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fortune has placed within my view. I will bid an everlaſting adieu to the all-faſcinating Mary: I will pray to Heaven that ſhe may fix her choice on a more fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate man; and that ſhe may forget, yes, for ever forget, the one who now reliquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, becauſe he feels himſelf unworthy of her.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Colonel Stuart liſtened with aſtoniſhment to the confeſſion he had heard; and when he reflected that Glencairn's ſole dependance was on himſelf, his heart was filled with the fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt eſteem for his character. Souls, he ſaid, ſuch as thoſe of Glencairn and his daughter, were ſurely paired in heaven. Earthly viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes might for a time ſeperate, but never could wholly diſunite them; and his mind, ſanguine as Mary's, ſtill preſaged a certainty of future felicity. But, from Glencairn, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be at preſent expected. When Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel Stuart ſaw that he was bent in following his fate, he inſiſted, in token of their mutual friendſhip, as well as of the tender regard he bore to the memory of his deceaſed father, that he ſhould accept from him a ſmall annuity of one hundred pounds; and he extorted from him a promiſe, that ſhould he perceive any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in his ſentiments reſpecting Lady Jane Martindale, that he would return to him as his ſon. To ſpare the delicacy of Mary, it was
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:030497_0083_0FE6F622BA78D388"/>
neceſſary to invent ſome plauſible ſtory; and they agreed to inform her, that unforeſeen bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs relative to a friend in Scotland (whom they named) would detain Glencairn longer in London, than it would be convenient for the Colonel to ſtay there. She received the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence with leſs ſurpriſe than they expected, and her father ſignified to her his intention of returning to Allanbank the week follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>On the evening before they were to ſet out, they all appeared alike affected at their approch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeparation. Glencairn knew too well his influence over the heart of Mary, not to dread that her feelings would be overpowered by it; and he mentioned as by chance to the Colonel, before her, that he hoped to join them in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land within a month. While he ſpoke, he caſt a ſide-look at Miſs Stuart; he ſaw her colour change, and the tears which ſhe vainly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſuppreſs. run down her cheeks. He haſtily called for a candle; pretended a drowſineſs he was never farther from feeling, and roſe to take his leave. He kiſſed Miſs Stuart with the moſt fervent affection; preſſed the Colonel's hand to his heart; and a tear fell on it: he ſoftly articulated the word <hi>fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>—and retired to his bed-chamber, where he threw himſelf on the ſofa, and indulged the effuſions <hi>of a heart torn by anguiſh and deſpaire.</hi>

               <p>GLENCAIRN remained near an hour in this ſtate of agonizing reflection, and was at length rouſed from it by hearing Colonel Stuart and his daughter retire to their apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. He had been reflecting ſeriouſly on his preſent ſituation, and on every thing that had paſſed; but above all, on the fatherly ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs he had ever experienced from Colonel Stuart, and the recent proof of it; on the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere affection of his lovely daughter;—on the ſituation of Lady Jane Martindale—<hi>a married woman!</hi>—on the diſſipated courſe of life ſhe led;—the cold indifference with which ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to receive his laſt viſit;—and the hints that had been given him, which gained ground every day, and appeared to taint the purity of her character. All theſe conſiderations darted like a ray of light on his bewildered mind, and he formed the RESOLUTION to throw himſelf at the ſame moment at Colonel Stuart's feet, and to implore from him the hand of his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. It was a ſudden and a violent deciſion, that admitted not of reflection. He dreaded to meet with oppoſition from his heart, ſhould he conſult it; he was no ſtranger to its weekneſs, and he felt that it required all his fortitude to enable him to accompliſh his preſent purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="unknown:030497_0085_0FE6F623F9023918"/>Fired by the momentary impulſe, he went to the door of Colonel Stuart's apartment, and gently knocking there, requeſted admiſſion, and attention to what he had to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.</p>
               <p>The Colonel was not in bed; he had juſt ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen from his knees, where it was his nightly cuſtom to proſtrate himſelf before his God, in fervent meditation. He was ſomewhat ſurpriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at ſeeing Glencairn, who had not yet begun to undreſs, and who, apologizing for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſion, proceeded to ſupplicate that he might find in him the tender advocate, not the inflex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible judge.</p>
               <p>He then told him that the purport of his noc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnal viſit was to implore once more his farther protection and advice. He begged that he would aſſiſt him to follow his own example, and point out to him the path of rectitude which ſhould direct him to ſhun the dangerous practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of a world he had already reaſon to ſuppoſe a deceitful one. He aſſured him, that he had ſeriouſly pondered on the ſentiments of his heart, and was convinced that on the exertions of his reaſon his future happineſs depended. He was now determined to purſue that line of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct that would be moſt pleaſing to his friend and benefactor, and was come to intreat his permiſſion to return with him to Scotland; where he doubted not but reaſon would ſoon teach him to overcome a mad attachment, of which he had ſeen the folly, and was therefore reſolved to ſubdue.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="unknown:030497_0086_0FE6F62EF3EAB5E0"/>Colonel Stuart learned with rapture this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py aſſurance of his pupil's return to virtue; and ſo indulgent was this excellent man to thoſe failings he had never known, that he would have conſidered himſelf the author of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, had he not accepted his proffered re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. How many virtuous minds are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by the want of this indulgence! and how much more laudable is it in a parent, or a friend, to draw a veil over the faults of youth, than to expoſe them in the face of day, and, inſtead of diminiſhing, augment them by their unkindneſs! What a contraſt to thoſe charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in ſuch a man as Colonel Stuart! He might be juſtly deſcribed as poſſeſſing a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand virtues, without a ſingle fault; or, if he HAD a fault it proceeded from the unbounded benevolence of his heart, which taught him to view mankind in general with an eye of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of which few were deſerving. But though he had experienced like others the poiſonous effects of ingratitude, he had not yet learned to think ill even of thoſe who had proved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unworthy of having known him, His houſe, his heart, and his purſe, were alike ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to all; and it was fortunate for himſelf, and his family, that he was a ſtranger in the gay world, where he muſt have inevitably fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len a prey to the deſigning. His way of life was ſuited to his ſituation and circumſtances, and that life was ſpent in doing good.</p>
               <p>It is no wonder, then, that Glencairn, who poſſeſſd his moſt tender regard ſhould not meet with any difficulty in perſuading him of the ſtability of his inclinations. They parted for
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:030497_0087_0FE6F62EF83E73E8"/>
the night under the moſt comfortable ſenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; the one, ſatisfied that he had acted up to his duty; the other, that he had ſaved a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous mind from perdition. Colonel Stuart fancied that he had ſnatched Glencairn from the edge of a precipice; and Glencairn fancied that he had ſubdued every blameable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity—Alas, poor human nature!</p>

               <p>WHEN Miſs Stuart roſe in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhe was ſurprized that Glencairn was to accompany them. Her heart rejoiced, as ſhe interpreted this change in his intentions to the impoſſibility he found of leaving her. Their journey was a pleaſant one; it was whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly undiſturbed by care or regret, for ſhe had left nothing in London that could tempt her to wiſh ever to return there. But her ſenſſibility was painfully tried, when ſhe firſt beheld Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanbank. The old houſe-keeper, who had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved there ever ſince the Colonel's marriage, welcomed her home with unfeigned joy. She conducted her towards the apartment that had been formerly her late miſtreſs's; but when they approached the door of it, Miſs Stuart gave a faint ſhriek, and fainted in her arms. The worthy Mrs. M'Kenzie was alarmed, but would not open the ill-cloſed wounds of her venerable maſter's heart, by making him wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs a ſcene that ſhe knew would be only mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary. She returned to the room where ſhe had left the gentlemen, and giving an expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive look at Glencairn, he inſtantly followed her. She conducted him up ſtairs, where they found Miſs Stuart attended by a houſe-maid, and beginning to recover. Glencairn flew to
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:030497_0089_0FE6F6301F527A78"/>
ſupport her with the tendereſt care. She raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her fine eyes, firſt to Heaven, as if to invoke the fainted ſpirit of her mother, and then turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with ineffable ſweetneſs upon him; he felt all that ſhe would expreſs, and his feelings were worked up to the higheſt pitch of grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful enthuſiaſm. He involuntarily dropped on one knee before her, and taking her hand in his, he ſupplicated the Almighty to ſtrengthen him in his reſolution, that he would never, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver forſake her! He aroſe when he had ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered this prayer. It came from the inmoſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of his heart, and had been pronounced in too awful a manner for him to retract it; neither would he have done ſo at that moment, for the poſſeſſion of Lady Jane Martindale her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Miſs Stuart had heard the bleſſed ſound; it ſunk from her ear to her heart; ſhe received, and cheriſhed it there, as an old friend whom ſhe had been long expecting, and who was at length returned to forſake her no more.</p>
               <p>She was now enabled to look over her apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with more compoſure. Her piano-forte had been placed there by the Colonel's order, that ſhe might be reconciled to the ſight of it. Glencairn went to his flute, and they paſſed an hour in that happy harmony proceeding from the union of ſouls. When alone, Glencairn took the opportunity of offering his heart and hand to Mary. With what modeſt joy did ſhe accept the tender aſſurances of both! She long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ruſh into her father's arms, and tell him of her promiſed felicity; but virgin delicacy <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

to Glencairn the bleſſed taſk of making him hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py; for ſhe well knew that his heart, like her own, had been long ſet on their union. He was not leſs anxious than herſelf to impart their converſation to the Colonel, which he did not however find an opportunity of doing, till after Miſs Stuart had left them for the night.</p>
               <p>Colonel Stuart received the declaration with an air of reſerve that ſurprized Glencairn, and filled him with confuſion. He deſired that he would allow himſelf time to reflect ſeriouſly on the nature of the ſolemn engagement into which he ſo ſuddenly and ſo lightly appeared to wiſh to enter. He conſidered it, he ſaid, a duty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on him to admoniſh them both, and to exhort them to do nothing raſhly; and how could he avoid believing that Glencairn only deceived himſelf in his preſent ideas, when little more than a week had elapſed ſince he had in the moſt ingenuous manner acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his inviolable attachment to Lady Jane Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tindale? How was he to reconcile ſuch incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtencies?—He added, that he had too high an opinion of the mind he had taken pride and pleaſure to adorn, to imagine for a moment that ſelf-intreſt would have the power to bias one of his actions; at the ſame time he owned that his daughter was in that point worthy his attention; and if he doubted his love for her, it proceeded from a fear that he did not know himſelf ſufficiently to be able to anſwer for his future conduct towards her throughout life.</p>
               <p>Glencairn endeavoured to wave theſe ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:030497_0091_0FE6F63A2FED0330"/>
objections. He could not, he ſaid, diſavow his firſt inclination, but he had (at leaſt he thought he had) ſubdued it. They parted with a promiſe from the Colonel, that in the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation he ſhould have with Miſs Stuart on the ſubject, he would not ſay any thing that might tend to impede their mutual happineſs. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Colonel knew enough of his daughter's ſentiments to be convinced, that although no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could alter her love for Glencairn, were he once to exert his parental authority, and forbid her to marry him, ſhe would obey him, though at the certain expenſe of her happineſs, and the probable one of her life.</p>
               <p>Colonel Stuart, the next morning, when breakfaſt was over, requeſted his daughter's at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance in his ſtudy, where they remained a conſiderable time, during which Glencairn did not find his ſituation of ſuſpenſe perfectly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable. He was at length relieved from it by their appearance, and he perceived that they had both been in tears. The Colonel took a hand of each of his children (as he was wont to call them), and joining them, he with humid eyes beſtowed on each his bleſſing. He could not ſay much, for his heart was full, but he deſired that their marriage might take place in two months from that time; ſome neceſſary ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement with reſpect to his fortune being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſable previous to that event. Glencairn ſaluted the bluſhing Mary; they mutually embraced, and thanked the Colonel, and the day was ſpent as may be ſuppoſed from theſe virtuous minds, each deriving comfort from the happineſs of the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="unknown:030497_0092_0FE6F63D7058F400"/>Nothing appeared to be wanting at Allen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank to complete the extent of human felicity. Miſs Stuart became more intereſting as ſhe was more beloved; for though Glencairn was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious that he ſhould not lead her to the altar with that enthuſiaſtic paſſion that borders on madneſs, and which ſeldom laſts long, his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem for, and his opinion of her augmented daily; and Colonel Stuart's winter of life which had been hurried on by grief more than age, appeared on this occaſion to be impeded in its progreſs by a renovating ſpring. They had few viſitors at Allanbank; ſome poor Scotch lairds were their principle neighbours, who having never gone beyond the Highlands, were ſo ignorant and uninformed, that their ſociety was rather courted through benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, than diſclaimed through pride. It was the intention of the family to paſs ſome of the next winter months at Edinburgh. The Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel had a numerous acquaintance there in Mrs. Stuart's lifetime; but ſince he had loſt her, and was ſeparated from his daughter, he neglected every worldly concern. They would not, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, find it difficult to meet with ſociety, whenever they viſited that charming city; for their virtues ſecured them friends, wherever they appeared.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXII.</head>
               <p>I HAVE already obſerved, that the conduct of Mr. Martindale towards Lady Jane was wholly altered. A viſible coolneſs had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken place, and her ears were perpetually aſſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the enumeration of Mrs Martindale's vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. Whatever ſhe ſaid, was a law both to her huſband and his ſon, and Lady Jane's life became more inſupportable, as her ſenſibility acquired more ſtrength. She had latterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted an intimacy with the two Miſs Field<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, daughters to the late Admiral of that name. They had been intimates of Lady Darnley. The eldeſt was remarkably accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed; ſhe was almoſt unrivalled on the harp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicord, and ſeemed to poſſeſs a ſoul capable of the moſt refined ſentiments. Lady Jane was very partial to this young lady, who appeared to be greatly affected by her ſituation. She frequently mentioned her diſlike to Mrs. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tindale; and though Lady Jane had ſtrictly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided even hinting at her miſconduct with Lord Darnley, Miſs Fielding gave her rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſuppoſe that ſhe was not ignorant of it.</p>
               <p>It was now Lent; and Miſs Fielding was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſtant in her attendance at the Oratorios.
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:030497_0094_0FE6F646C40F6DC0"/>
She had one evening ſolicited Lady Jane's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in her box at Dury-Lane, who had lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ſeldom gone into public, but was tempted to accept the invitation, as Giornovich, whom ſhe had never ſeen, was to play there. She had heard much of that charming performer, but found that report, ſo laviſh in his praiſe, was yet unequal to convey a juſt idea of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. It was <hi>The Meſſiah</hi> that was performed; and at th<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

She took out her pencil, when it was over, and wrote on the back of a letter the following extempore lines:
<q>
                     <l>Seraphic ſtrains the tender feelings move,</l>
                     <l>And Muſick melts the ſoul to heav'n-born love!</l>
                     <l>Thy powers, oh Giornovich! inſpire the breaſt,</l>
                     <l>And give the wounded mind a tranſient reſt;</l>
                     <l>But, while thy notes impaſſion'd boſoms pleaſe,</l>

                     <l>They leave a new invader of my peace!</l>
                  </q>
She had juſt finiſhed the firſt effort of her poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical talent, which ſhe intended to correct at leiſure, and was conveying haſtily to her pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, when the box door opened, and Lord Darnley made his unexpected appearance. He
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:030497_0095_0FE6F646C96F2940"/>
bowed with infinite grace to the Miſs Field<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, darted a contemptuous look on Mrs. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tindale (who had obtruded herſelf on the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, from a very ſlight invitation), and with more apparent pleaſure than prudence ſmiled on Lady Jane, and ſeated himſelf immediately behind her. He told her, he had been in town but a few hours; that he had firſt viſited THEIR little charge, and then called in Argyle-Street; but hearing from her ſerva<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> that ſhe was gone to Drury-Lane, he had ta<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>n the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to follow her there.</p>
               <p>Mrs Martindale who was pretending to adjuſt her handkerchief, did not loſe a word of this ſpeech; but ſaid, loud enough to be heard in the next box, That now one impediment was removed, on his lordſhip's ſide, ſhe thought the other might be eaſily accompliſhed; for ſhe was pretty ſure that young Mr, Martindale would not have much objection to ſee his name added to the liſt of happy huſbands in Doctors commons. This was too groſs an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult to be patiently endured; but Lord Darn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, however confuſed, was too well-bred a man to recriminate. Lady Jane faintly aſked her what ſhe meant; and pleading the exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive heat of the houſe as an excuſe for leaving the Miſs Fieldings, requeſted Lord Darnley (who was the only gentleman in the box) to ſee her to her carriage, where ſhe inſiſted, however reluctantly, on his taking his leave.</p>
               <p>Mr. Martindale was already in bed, and ſhe was obliged to defer ſpeaking to him till morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:030497_0096_0FE6F6499B2FA010"/>
Mrs. Drapery informed her, that Lord Darnley had been there, but, on finding her ladyſhip was out, had requeſted to ſee her wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. That ſhe went to the coach door, and he aſked her many queſtions about the ſtate of the family; telling her,
<q>That he would do handſomely by her, if ſhe would keep his ſecret, which was, to tell her lady, that in conſequence of letters he had received from town, which mentioned the diſagreeable ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation into which her ladyſhip was thrown by the machinations of Mrs. Martindale, he was arrived, fully determined to protect her with his life.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Oldſon, the butler, had watched this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view; and whether jealouſy of Mrs. Drapery, or ſome other ſuſpicion, aroſe in his mind, I know not; but he inſiſted on her telling him all that had paſſed. Nay, he was ſo reſolved on knowing it, that he even threatened Mrs. Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery to retract his promiſe of marriage to her, if ſhe did not immediately confeſs every thing to him. Any other menace Mrs. Drapery might poſſibly have withſtood; but that of a diſappointment in love was too powerful. She candidly acknowledged the confidence Lord Darnley had placed in her, but firſt obtained a promiſe from Mr. Oldſon of his ſilence on the ſubject.</p>
               <p>He wiſhed to preſuade her not to mention it to her lady; but this truſty confidante, recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting Lord Darnley's offer to <hi>do honeſtly by her,</hi> longed for the moment when ſhe ſhould be at
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:030497_0097_0FE6F649A1B99B20"/>
liberty to divulge the ſecret of which ſhe had been till then in painful poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>Lady Jane felt a glow of ſatisfaction riſe on her cheek, as ſhe liſtened to Mrs. Drapery's information. Situate as ſhe then was, every proof of regard, even from the moſt indifferent perſon, became dear to her. The cruel and unmerited treatment ſhe every day endured, had the ſame effect on her gentle mind that a ſtormy ſea has on a mariner. Her heart panted for reſt, for ſhe ſaw herſelf environed by ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies where ſhe might naturally have expected friends. She felt that matters were drawing to a criſis, that would ſoon determine her fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture fate.</p>
               <p>The next morning ſhe told Mr. Martindale of the inſult that had been offered to her at the Oratorio. He ſeemed perfectly indifferent, and ſaid ſhe might thank herſelf for it: that when a married woman had once openly admitted the addreſſes of another man, her huſband could not be blamed for diſcarding her. That he had no cauſe of complaint againſt Lord Darn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, as he conceived that he had acted only as every other gay man would do in the ſame ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation; and he finiſhed by telling her that ſhe was perfectly at liberty to follow Lord Darn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley's fortunes wherever they might lead her.</p>
               <p>That calm ſerenity of mind which had ever dignified the exemplary character of Lady Jane Martindale, now entirely forſook her. She
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:030497_0098_0FE6F651F90EC408"/>
uttered the moſt piercing complaints againſt her unfeeling huſband for his injuſtice and cruelty towards her, and the moſt bitter invectives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the infamous Mrs. Martindale; and when ſhe ſaw that it was impoſſible to perſuade him of her innocence, ſhe found it neceſſary to have recourſe to meaſures the moſt repugnant to her feelings, and at once to declare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all ſhe knew: ſhe then entered into a minute detail of the intrigue that had been carried on between Mrs. Martindale and Lord Darnley at the French milliner's houſe.</p>
               <p>Mr. Martindale rang for his hat, and went immediately to his father's, telling Lady Jane he ſhould return preſently. He did ſo; and his countenance was inflamed by anger, as he aſked her,
<q>How ſhe dared to aſperſe the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of of a virtuous woman?</q>
She had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured, he ſaid, to deſtroy that of Mrs. Martindale, becauſe ſhe had refuſed to become a partner in her vices. She was jealous, he ſuppoſed, of Mrs. Martindale's ſuperior beauty and qualifications, and of the attention Lord Darnley had, like other men, paid her. He adviſed her to take up her reſidence with THEIR charge, at Paddington, and limited her to three days to remove her effects from his houſe: he excepted his mother's jewels, which he inſiſted on having immediately reſtored to him. He then rang the bell, which was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by Oldſon, whom he commanded in a peremptory manner no longer to conſider La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Jane as his miſtreſs, and to make known that ſuch were his injunctions to all the other
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:030497_0099_0FE6F65201377278"/>
domeſtics. Oldſon would have ſpoken, but was prevented by a look that forbade all poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of a reply. He then ordered a chaiſe and four to be immediately got in readineſs from the neareſt inn, and told Oldſon to prepare to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him.</p>
               <p>The triumph of paſſion was ſoon over; and a tear of pity. and perhaps of remaining ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs (which he uſed every effort to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs), fell down his cheeks as he took hold of Lady Jane's hand: when turning his head on the other ſide, he bade her an eternal adieu. He threw bank notes on the table to the value of five hundred pounds, and then tore himſelf from her in a paroxy ſin of agony that fell little ſhort of her own.</p>

               <p>IN a moment like this, how was Lady Jane Martindale to proceed? Were I to aſk a hundred people, I ſhould receive a hundred different opinions; but Lady Jane had no time for reflection. The arrow had been aimed at her heart, and it was lodged there. She order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mrs. Drapery into her preſence; who, with many tears, beſought her to compoſe her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. She deſired her to pack up in a box by themſelves, all the jewels and trinkets that old Mr. Martindale and his ſon had once given to her, but of which ſhe was no longer the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs; and then aſked as a favour, what but two hours before ſhe had a right to command, that one of the ſervants might go for a hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney coach, that ſhe might call at two or three places ſhe thought neceſſary, while her wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was packing up her clothes, as ſhe deſired. She was going firſt to ſee Mrs. Martindale; for though her noble heart ſhrunk from the idea of ſupplicating her enemy, yet ſhe thought it a duty ſhe owed herſelf, to explain to that lady, as matters now ſtood, the neceſſity that had driven her to give ſuch a painful explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every circumſtance that could tend to corroborate her own innocence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="unknown:030497_0101_0FE6F6548A6A65A8"/>With ſwollen eyes, which ſhe endeavoured as much as poſſible to conceal by her long lace veil, ſhe ſtepped into the coach, and ordered it to Devonſhire-Place. Alas! the ſervants there had not only received orders never more to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit her, but were even inſolent enough to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs before the coachman their aſtoniſhment at her calling there. She then went to Miſs Fielding's and had the ſatisfaction to find that her friend was at home. They knew nothing more of the miſintelligence than what had paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the oratorio, and entreated her to return home, and to inform them the next morning in what manner it had been ſettled. Lady Jane, after a ſhort viſit, returned to Argyle-Street, and found a ſervant of old Mr. Martin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale's, who had brought a note from his ſon, and only waited for an anſwer to leave town. In it he deſired her to ſend him an inventory, directed to Ledſtone, of the things ſhe had left there, which he ſaid ſhould be ſent to her wherever ſhe might appoint, as he was going to ſell that eſtate. It contained alſo a requeſt that ſhe would quit Argyle-Street as ſoon as poſſible; and that ſhe would not attempt mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mrs. Drapery the companion of her ſlights as it would be the means of preventing that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's being reſpectfully ſettled with Oldſon, and he doubted Lady Jane's future ability of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſing her, if ſhe attempted to prevent it.</p>
               <p>Lady Jane poſſeſſed too much of the pride inſeparable from a noble mind. to be required a third time to quit the houſe. She eaſily
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:030497_0102_0FE6F65F18E29EE8"/>
perceived that Drapery's views on Oldſon ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſeded all affection for herſelf; and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he would willingly have ſuffered her for the preſent to accompany her, yet he fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his maſter's diſpleaſure were ſhe to do ſo.</p>
               <p>Lady Jane deſired Oldſon to change for her a fifty pounds note; ſhe gave ten to Mrs. Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery more than was due to her for the trouble ſhe had in packing up her things, which ſhe deſired her to take care of till ſhe ſent for them. Another ten ſhe gave to Oldſon to divide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the ſervants, beſides two guineas for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and in a fit of wild deſpair, unaccompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a ſingle attendant, and without having taſted of the dinner that the ſervants had as uſual prepared, and placed before her, ſhe ſent for a hackney coach at ten o'clock at night, and ordered the coachman to drive her which way he pleaſed, till ſhe ſhould otherwiſe direct him.</p>

               <p>THE coachman proceeded on a journey he could not rightly comprehend, and at length ſtopped at the turnpike beyond Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter-bridge. Lady Jane was ruminating whither ſhe ſhould go, when ſhe was rouſed from her reverie by a demand for the toll. Her memory brought ſeveral perſons to her recollection, but ſhe dreaded to meet with a cool reception, wherever ſhe appeared, and made known her ſtory. Of Lord Darnley's addreſs ſhe was ignorant, and the lateneſs of the hour would alone have prevented her cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on him. She deſired the coachman would drive her to Liſſon Green, where ſhe found that the family was already in bed. She knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed repeatedly, and at length with ſome diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty obtained admiſſion into the nurſe's bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber.</p>
               <p>She apologized for her unſeaſonable viſit, and the myſtery of its appearance, diſcharged the coach, and by down by the ſleeping infant. But ſhe could neither compoſe herſelf, nor let the nurſe, till ſhe had made ſome enquiries re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting Lord Darnley. The anſwer was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of the only ſatisfaction it was at that moment in her power to receive, as ſhe found
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:030497_0104_0FE6F6609CC72060"/>
that he had promiſed to be there the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by twelve o'clock, She ſoon after cloſed her wearied eye-lids, and ſunk to momentary reſt.</p>
               <p>Lord Darnley was punctual to his appointed hour; and giving his horſe to the groom, ran eagerly up ſtaris. Nothing could equal his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement at ſeeing Lady Jane there, pale, diſhevelled, and half-dreſt, ſitting with his child on her knee. She aroſe as he entered, and giving miſs Darnley into the nurſe's arms, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired ſhe would retire with her into the garden, while ſhe ſpoke to her Lord. But when ſhe began to relate her mournful tale, ſhe found herſelf wholly unable to proceed. She claſped her hands in ſpeechleſs agony, and lifting up her eyes to <hi>Him</hi> who could alone ſupport and ſtrengthen her in the hour of affliction, ſhe burſt into tears.</p>
               <p>When ſhe had a little recovered herſelf, ſhe explained, as well as ſhe was able, her unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved ſituation; leaving the preſent diſpoſal of herſelf to the ſuperior judgment of Lord Darnley, whoſe protection was the only one ſhe could now claim. He took her hand, and thanking her for the confidence with which ſhe honoured him, beſought her permiſſion to go inſtantly to town in order to provide for her a more ſuitable apartment. He left her, and in leſs than three hours returned in a poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaiſe, in which ſhe gladly accompanied him ſhe knew not, nor cared not whither.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="106" facs="unknown:030497_0105_0FE6F660A088CBE0"/>The temporary reſidence that Lord Darnley had procured for Lady Jane, was at a lodging houſe in Great Cumberland Street; and he took one for himſelf within a few doors of it, which happened to be the ſame that had been occupied by Colonel Stuart and his family. But this he did not know; and not chooſing at once to inform Lady Jane of his being ſo near a neighbour, ſhe alſo remained ignorant of it. Lord Darnley had called her in both houſes Lady Findlater, and ſaid ſhe was a baronet's widow. This had been agreed on in the chaiſe, to prevent ſuſpicion or enquiry. He paſſed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral hours of the day with her, and ſhe ſaw no other perſon. His valet, who uſually at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended her, was a new one, who fortunately had not ſeen or heard of her before. But it was neceſſary to intruſt the nurſe, who was a decent woman, and to be depended on. She was moreover aſſured that ſhe would loſe her place from the moment there was the leaſt cauſe to ſuſpect that ſhe had betrayed her Lord.</p>
               <p>From her they ſoon received intelligence, that ſhe had been ſeveral times followed by dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent people whom ſhe did not know, as ſhe went in and out of town with Miſs Darnley; in conſequence of which it became neceſſary to remove them, and they were ſent to Bromp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</p>
               <p>A fatality is frequently attendant on different ſituations in life, which eludes all that the moſt watchful vigilance can ſurmiſe to prevent it. It was ſo in the preſent incident. Not all the
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:030497_0106_0FE6F669CB17BCA8"/>
caution obſerved both by Lady Jane and Lord Darnley, nor the fidelity of the nurſe could counteract the decree of fate. Great effects proceed frequently from trivial cauſes, which can be neither foreſeen nor prevented.</p>
               <p>Lord Darnley's valet perceived that there was ſome myſtery about Lady Findlater; but being a country fellow, who knew nothing of London, and being much confined at home, he had no opportunity of talking over his Lord's affairs among his fellow-ſervants; and the nurſe, who was rather a pretty girl, hardly conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to ſpeak to him. Lord Darnley had one morning written to Lady Jane, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted as uſual the note to his ſervant; who thought this a good opportunity to ſatisfy the curioſity of their landlady, with whom he had frequently converſed on the ſubject. She was overjoyed at his offer, and particularly ſo as he requeſted her to give it into the lady's own hands, which was a charge he alſo had received from his maſter.</p>
               <p>She took the note, and went directly to the door of the apartment, which was to her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable aſtoniſhment, opened by Lady Jane Martindale, who was as much confuſed as her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; ſhe firſt ſuſpected that it was ſome trick put upon her by her family, till ſhe learned that Lord Darnley was in poſſeſſion of Colonel Stuart's former lodgings in her houſe. She en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated her to preſerve the moſt inviolable ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy, which was faithfully promiſed, without any intention of performing it·</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="unknown:030497_0107_0FE6F669CECFF630"/>This ſlender circumſtance laid a laſting foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for every ſubſequent event of Lady Jane's life. The moment the landlady returned home, ſhe put on her hat and cloak with all poſſible ſpeed, and telling the valet ſhe was going to market, without any farther explanation, poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed directly to Mr. Martindale's houſe in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyle Street, whither ſhe had once been on a viſit to Mrs. Drapery, in company with Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephine, Miſs Stuart's Neapolitan maid. Mrs. Drapery was at home, and in the act of writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her dear Oldſon, who was ſtill at Led<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone with his maſter. As ſoon as ſhe had heard ALL, ſhe preſented her viſitant with a glaſs of her beſt cordial, and begged to have the HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOUR of her company another time, as ſhe was juſt finiſhing an important letter, and feared being too late for the poſt. Theſe two wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy females exchanged ſeveral polite curteſies, and parted highly ſatisfied with each other; the one having communicated all ſhe knew, and the other having heard all ſhe wiſhed; for they were till that moment ignorant of Lady Jane's deſtination. Mrs. Drapery added ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſheet to her already voluminous packet; and as ſoon as ſhe had diſpatched it, and finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her dinner, ſhe ſent for every one of the ſervants into the houſkeeper's room, to whom ſhe related the whole of this marvellous tale.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Drapery was now ſole miſtreſs of the houſe; conſequently whatever ſhe ſaid, was the grand rule of their actions. I muſt indeed except a Yorkſhire groom; who having ſat like
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:030497_0108_0FE6F66AD67C2250"/>
the reſt open-mouthed to hear pronounced the ſentence of his lady's condemnation, declared "he would go to her that very moment, and know in what he could ſerve her, for that ſhe was as good a lady as ever broke bread; and he was certain that as for Yorkſhire, there was never a gentleman in the whole country that would have turned ſuch a tender-hearted lady out of doors, but that he had heard theſe Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doners would do any thing. He did not care for his maſter; he might hang him if he liked, and keep his wages into the bargain; but that now he knew where to find his lady, he would go and offer his ſervice to her; ay, and ſtick by her, if ſhe would let him, without a farth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wages, as long as he lived."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Drapery expatiated on the reſentment of an enraged maſter, and the deſtruction that would inevitably overtake him, and finally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent his ever getting another place, ſhould he perſiſt in ſuch a fooliſh ſcheme:—but all would not do; nothing could induce Tom to relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh his preſent purpoſe; and with all the blunt honeſty and feeling of a TRUE YORK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SHIREMAN, he went immediately to his maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's ſtables, where, giving up his charge of the ſaddle-horſes to the coachman, he packed up his all in a ſmall bundle, and without taking leave of his aſſociates, whom his heart curſed for their cruelty, he walked with aching ſteps towards Great Cumberland Street.</p>
               <p>In his way thither, he reflected for the firſt time of his life on what he was about. He had
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:030497_0109_0FE6F66ADAF6EC70"/>
given up his place, and all the intereſt he had, without having any juſt reaſon to ſuppoſe that Lady Jane would befriend him. What was he to do if ſhe refuſed him an aſylum?—Tom had no friends in London; they were all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of Ripon; yet Tom did not repent, He already had received full compenſation for any hardſhips he might in future undergo. He had experienced that inward joy, that inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribable felicity of having given way to the genuine feelings of an honeſt heart. He did not ſuppoſe that his lady would ſuffer him to want; but if ſhe did, he ſhould only be reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to temporary neceſſity, and that too in a noble cauſe; <hi>the cauſe of injured innocence.</hi> His friends were induſtrious, hard-working people, who would not, he was very ſure, diſmiſs him becauſe he did not bring them <hi>Gold.</hi> No; they had ever prayed him to remain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them ſteady to the plough, as his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers had been; but Tom had ſeen laced live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in the neighbourhood of Ripon; and more from the generous motive of thinking he could henceforward add to the little wealth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready poſſeſſed by his family, than any ſelf-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted principle of his own, he had ſet out on his perilous journey, TO SEE THE WORLD.</p>

               <p>TOM was at firſt refuſed admittance; till by his ſobs and tears, and his aſſeverati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that he had left his place for no other reaſon than to wait on his lady, he prevailed on the miſtreſs of the houſe to go up ſtairs a ſecond time, and ſhe conſented to ſee him, He briefly related by what means he had diſcovered her reſidence, and begged her ladyſhip's pardon for his boldneſs in coming after her, and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive which had induced him to do ſo. Lady Jane thanked him for his attention, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing five guineas from her purſe adviſed him to return to his place, or, if he did not chooſe that, ſhe would recommend him, ſhe ſaid, to Lord Darnley, who would procure him ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Tom looked firſt at the money, and then wiſtfully at Lady Jane; for he feared to offend, as he begged to be excuſed taking it; and he ventured to hint, that, not ſeeing any ſervants about her, he thought ſhe could but ill ſpare it; and all he implored was, that ſhe would keep him in her ſervice. The poor creature pleaded ſo powerfully, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible ſhe could without cruelty reſiſt him; ſo ordering him to put the money in his pocket, ſhe ſuffered him to enter on the pleaſing taſk of rendering himſelf a faithful attendant on her.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="unknown:030497_0111_0FE6F66EDF036078"/>Lady Jane employed the remainder of the morning in writing a long narative of facts to her father. She endeavoured to prepare him in the moſt delicate and pathetic manner for the knowledge of her misfortunes, and anticipated the total forgetfulneſs of theſe, in his ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thizing tenderneſs. She obſerved that ſhe had only quitted an unpleaſant home, to return to her native happy one; and ſhe requeſted his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of her joining him immediately in Ireland. With eager expectation ſhe told him ſhe ſhould wait his reply, which would in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing determine her future conduct. Her hours appeared to grow lighter from the moment her letter was given to the poſtman, and ſhe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in idea its haſty progreſs during the night; forming a thouſand pleaſing conjectures on the event of its ſucceſs. Lord Darnley had for the firſt time neglected viſiting her that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening; but when he called the next morning, he found her more cheerful than he had hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſeen her; and as the day was remarkably fine, he propoſed their going in a hackney coach to ſee Miſs Darnley at Brompton, and walking in one of the retired paths of its neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood. Lord Darnley returned to dinner with her, and had been juſt propoſing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company her to Ireland as ſoon as ſhe received her father's anſwer; telling her, that now the Martindales knew where to find them both, he doubted not but that all poſſible means would be tried to haſten a divorce: and he hoped to receive, as ſoon as it was pronounced, her hand from her father. He had never ſpoken ſo open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before. In thoſe few words were compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:030497_0112_0FE6F677F1BF7D28"/>
all ſhe wiſhed to hear, and ſhe felt elat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the idea of being reſtored to happineſs. Their converſation was interrupted by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of Tom, who brought a letter that had been put into his hands by one of the ſervants from Argyle-ſtreet; it was addreſſed to Lady Jane; ſhe knew her huſband's hand on the direction, which was all he had written. In the blank cover was a letter to himſelf, which had been ſent to Ledſtone, and was from thence forwarded by him. It bore the Iriſh poſt-mark, and was ſealed with black. Lady Jane ſaw the ſignature, and fainted away. Her heart fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boded its dreadful contents; there was no need of her reading it, to be convinced of <hi>this, her greateſt misfortune!</hi> Lord Darnley took it up, and found that it contained an affecting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt from the ſteward to Mr. Martindale, that he would break the news of the Earl's ſudden death to Lady Jane in the tendereſt manner poſſible- He had departed this but two hours before it was written, conſequently no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge codld be had of the ſituation in which he had left his affairs; but the ſteward added, that as he had reaſon to believe his lorſtſhip had left Mr. Martindale ſole executor, he entreated that gentleman to come with all poſſible haſte to Dublin.</p>
               <p>Lady Jane ſoon recovered from her ſtate of inſenſibility; but her heart was turned to woe, and ſhe bore this afflicting circumſtance with more compoſure at the moment than might have been expected. She looked up to Lord Darn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley as HER ONLY FRIEND, for where in the
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:030497_0113_0FE6F677F6ABF0F0"/>
vaſt univerſe could ſhe claim another?—He ſincerely felt for and pitied her, and he promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her every aſſiſtance, at this diſmal junct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure, that ſhe could derive from his affection, his ſociety, and advice. But ſhe was deeply affected by her recent loſs; and her grief was of the moſt dangerous kind, as it grew into a ſettled melancholy, which increaſed daily. She continually pondered on her ſituation, and at length, without conſulting Lord Darnley, or even mentioning the circumſtance to him, ſhe wrote to Miſs Fielding, giving her a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantial detail of all that had paſſed, and entreating to ſee her. She gave Tom orders to wait for an anſwer, and he brought back her own letter, unſealed, in a blank cover. She found herſelf DESPISED AND REJECTED, and a conſtant ſucceſſion of ſad ideas filled her very ſoul. The wounded mind will, like the drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man, catch at every ſhadow of a ſubſtance; and Lady Jane, penetrated with Lord Darn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley's attentive friendſhip, inſenſibly attached herſelf to him. He could now prevail on her with leſs difficulty to accompany him in riding, walking, &amp;c, till by degrees ſhe gave herſelf up irrecoverably to him, and refuſed nothing to a man whom ſhe with confidence conſidered as her future huſband and natural protector.</p>
               <p>Lady Jane and Lord Darnley were more publickly together than formerly, but ſtill kept their reſpective lodgings. In leſs than a month after her father's death, ſhe received a ſecond letter from the ſteward, written at the deſire of Mr. Martindale, who was, he informed
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:030497_0114_0FE6F680668B3FA0"/>
her, arrived in Dublin to take poſſeſſion of all that had been left her. He ſent her word that, on his return to England, he would ſecure her a ſettlement adequate to the fortune he had with her; and Lord Darnley received, about the ſame time a citation from Doctors Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</p>

               <p>WE will now reviſit with regret our friends at allanbank; I ſay with regret, becauſe we left them at the ſummit of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and (if we accompany them at all) we muſt deſcend with them into the valley of woe· Colonel Stuart was ſurprized one morning, as he was ſitting in his ſtudy, by a large pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et directed to him, which, on opening, he found to contain ſeveral ſheets from an elder brother, who had been long ſettled at Madras; and of whom he had not received any tidings for more than twenty years, a coolneſs having ſubſiſted ſince that time between them. The Colonel was perfectly ignorant whether he was living or dead. But as old age brings reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and draws us naturally back to our firſt attachments, Mr. Stuart at laſt recollected that he had a brother, who he had lately heard was not only living, but was a widower, with an only daughter. He wrote rather a kind letter to the Colonel, giving a long account of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. He had been married, he ſaid, twice; and had three children, none of whom ſurvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and his laſt wife, who was alſo his laſt tie in that country, was lately dead. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of his age and infirmities, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that he had made a conſiderable fortune
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:030497_0116_0FE6F68186038530"/>
in the eaſt, which in was his intention to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath to his niece. He deſired that the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel would either embark in the firſt ſhip deſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to India, or that he would ſend over ſome perſon, in whom he could place confidence, to attend to the ſettling of his affairs; he added, that in caſe of his dying before ſuch a one arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, he had already taked care to make a will in favour of Miſs Stuart, his niece.</p>
               <p>The Colonel exulted but little in his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's unexpected proſpect of future fortune. She had enough to make her happy, and they co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veted no more Yet it was neceſſary on every account to accede to her uncle's requeſt. She might have a large family, and it was a duty incumbent on him not to neglect a circumſtance that had the appearance of turning out ſo much to her advantage, and ſo far beyond their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation. To caſt away a gift that was as it were thrown into their lap, would be, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Colonel Stuart's ideas, to render them<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelves; unworthy the diſpenſations of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in their favour. The only difficulty was, to determine on who was proper to go over. It was a long perilous voyage to be undertaken by the Colonel; and he could not think of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating Glencairn and his daughter, at a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when they were on the point of marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and when every thing ſeemed to ſmile propitious on their union.</p>
               <p>When he met them, his countenance bore the viſible marks of perturbation and anxiety; and it was ſome time before he could collect
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:030497_0117_0FE6F68189BAAD48"/>
himſelf ſufficiently to impart to them the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the letter. Glencairn and Mary watched each other's countenance while he was reading it; but when the Colonel ſignified his intention of firſt joining their hands, and then leaving them while he made the long, long voyage, Mary at once declared that ſhe would rather relinquiſh every earthly advantage than ſuffer her father to undertake it. To her, and to Glencairn, no increaſe of fortune could bring increaſe of happineſs; and why ſhould they traverſe ſeas to riſk the loſs of THAT, of which they were already in poſſeſſion?</p>
               <p>Glencairn ſtood in a delicate ſituation. His wandering heart prompted him to inſiſt on being the deputed perſon, yet he feared two unkind conſtructions that might be put on it if he did ſo; and theſe were, indifference towards Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and ſelf intereſt. If either of them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderated, it was not ſurely the letter. He aſked Mary what he ſhould do?—She expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet was not immediately prepared for the queſtion. It was about the time when the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diamen were to ſail; and while Colonel Stuart retired to his ſtudy to write to a friend in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don in order io make proper enquiries about them, Miſs Stuart and Glencairn walked into the garden, where they agreed that there was no alternative between his going to India, and the loſs of her uncle's favour and fortune.</p>
               <p>When Colonel Stuart ſaw that it was in vain to oppoſe Glencairn's reſolution, ſtrengthened by the conſent of Mary, he told him he ſhould
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:030497_0118_0FE6F68BE9102948"/>
leave it entirely to himſelf, and his daughter, whether their marriage ſhould take place before or after his return; but Miſs Stuart begged to continue in her preſent ſituation till he did ſo. She thought ſhe ſhould be better able to bear his abſence as her friend, than as her huſband: they were already betrothed; ſhe could not doubt his love for her; and ſhe conſidered the ſacrifice he was about to make, as the greateſt proof that he could give of it.</p>
               <p>The Colonel uſed all poſſible diſpatch in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding every neceſſary preparation for Glen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cairn's departure; and he ſoon received an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer from the friend to whom he hnd written, who was one of the Eaſt India Directors, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming him that his paſſage was taken on board the Melville Caſtle, which was to ſail in three weeks. The arrival of this letter cauſed a few pearly drops to trickle down the cheeks of Mary; but the blow was given, and it was too late to recede.</p>

               <p>WE will paſs over the melancholy ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and, leaving Colonel and Miſs Stuart at Allanbank in better health than ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, accompany Glencairn to London.</p>
               <p>As he approached the gay metropolis, his mind dwelt on the idea of Lady Jane Martindale. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very carriage that he met he fancied to contain her, and every well dreſt perſon he ſaw he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiouſly looked at, as ſuppoſing he could receive from them ſome information of her. On the morning after his arrival, he waited on the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector with a letter from Colonel Stuart; but finding he was gone to Blackwall, to dine on board the Melville Caſtle, he ordered a poſt-chaiſe, and followed him. He was introduced by that gentleman to Captain Dundas and the other officers, and was much pleaſed both with his acquaintance and his birth there. He was informed that the ſhip was to go down the river in ten days. He returned to town with his new friend in the evening, and on their way could not forbear aſking him if he was acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Martindale family?—By report on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, was the reply; and indeed he ſaid the late tranſactions of that family were not calculated to make any perſon wiſh to know more of them.
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:030497_0120_0FE6F68D74DECE28"/>
This led to an explanation, and, when they arrived, to the peruſal of a newſpaper a few days old, which was at the Director's, and contained a long account of the ELOPEMENT of Lady Jane Martindale with Lord Darnley, <hi>&amp;</hi>c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Glencairn was engaged to ſtay ſupper, but retired to his hotel as ſoon as it was over; and finding that a porter kept watch all night, he put on a great coat, and walked immediately to Argyle Street. When he approached the houſe, he heard the ſound of fiddles, and people danc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: he at once diſbelieved the report, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it very unlikely, if it were true, that Mr. Martindale ſhould have a ball in his houſe. He was however ſoon convinced of his error, when he ſaw ſeveral odd-looking men reeling out of it, and heard them hallooing for coaches for the LADIES. He addreſſed himſelf to the moſt decent-looking one, who told him it was Mrs. Drapery's birth-day, and that all the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen's gentleman and ladies' women of the neighbourhood were aſſembled to celebrate it; that Mr. Martindale was at his county ſeat in Cornwall, and that Lady Jane was gone off with Lord Darnley. Glencairn thanked his informer, and returned to his apartment. He had appointed a week from that day to go on board the ſhip, and was determined to employ the whole of it in making enquiries after her. He flattered himſelf that it would be in his power to "recall the wanderer home;" and ſhould he fail in the attempt, it was ſtill a laud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able one. He thought he ſaw her deſtitute of
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:030497_0121_0FE6F68D79BE64F8"/>
money, and of friends; and might he not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the place of both?—Yet, he again reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was ſhe deſerving ſuch attention from him, and o<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ght he not to be with-held from ſhewing it by his ſacred engagement to Mary Stuart? The gentle, the virtuous, the faithful Mary poſſeſſed but, alas! the ſecond place in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard; he was more rivetted by honour, than he was bound by love.</p>
               <p>The next morning, the Director favoured him with a viſit, and inſiſted on his dining with him. They talked of Colonel Stuart, and Glencairn ſlightly touched on his engagement with his daughter; but as ſeveral gentlemen were preſent, many words did not paſs on the ſubject. Glencairn drank freely of Cape and a variety of other wines. His life had hitherto been one continued ſcene of ſobriety, and it was not to be wondered at, in the preſent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the liquor ſtaggered his reaſon, and at length wholly overcame it. To this might be added the diſordered ſituation of his mind, and both threw him into a ſtate of temporary madneſs. He ſtole away from the Director's houſe, and went directly to Mr. Martindale's; where, on enquiring for Mrs. Drapery, he ſoon gained admiſſion. She immediately knew him; confirmed all he had heard; told him where to find Lady Jane; and finiſhed by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that had he come ſooner to town, he would have probably had the preference over Lord Darnley.</p>
               <p>Fluſhed as he was with wine, and inflamed
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:030497_0122_0FE6F69755FB74E8"/>
by the ſubject, he ſcarcely gave her time to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the ſentence, ere he directed his wayward ſteps towords Great Cumberland Street. No ſooner was the ſtreet door opened, than he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuouſly ruſhed forward, and, without making any enquiry at Lady Jane's apartment, abrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entered it. She ſtarted, and was terrified by his appearance, and received him with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant civility. His paſſion knew no bounds. Love, jealouſy, and rage, were couſpicuous in his countenance; he called her <hi>infamous,</hi> and ungrateful, and vowed to be the death of Lord Darnley, if ſhe did not inſtantly conſent to go off with him. At the word <hi>infamous,</hi> ſhe ſhuddered. Her ſoul diſdained the menace, and the accuſer; yet ſhe was ſtung by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions. Was that the language ſhe deſerved, or had been accuſtomed to?—Was there NO diſcrimination? no more gentle epithet for a heart nearly broken by accumulated misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, but which had plunged into an illegal, though almoſt unavoidable connection?—She had been thrown headlong down a precipice, and was now accuſed, and reproaches, becauſe ſhe fell! Glencairn had not arrived time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſnatch her from impending ruin; but he ſeemed to triumph in her misfortune, and to take an unmanly advantage of it to inſult her. She felt that her ſituation laid her open to the frowning cenſures of the world, but he was the laſt perſon that ſhould remind her of it. She had not reaſon to expect to meet with lenity from her female acquaintance, after the KIND leſſon Miſs Fielding had taught her. Alas! were all the SEEMING virtuous charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

to be unmaſked, how many, more culpable in reality than Lady Jane, would be branded with the word <hi>infamous!</hi> The daughters of Albion, as they are the faireſt productions of nature, ſhould be alſo the moſt generous. They ſhould learn to pity, before they condemn; they ſhould be merciful, as God is merciful; and they would find more favour in his ſight when they wipe away the tear of anguiſh, than when they wantonly and cruelly augment it.

               <p>Youth, beauty, health, and even life itſelf, are too frequently ſacrificed to theſe miſtaken prejudices of the world.

It has long been a diſputed point, whether or not the pleaſures flowing from SENSIBILITY are not more than overbalanced by the croſſes, diſappointments,

               <p>LADY Jane prevailed at length on Glen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cairn to retire; which however ſhe was not able to accompliſh till he had extorted from her a promiſe to conſider of his propoſals, and to ſend him a definitive anſwer to them in the morning. She alſo obtained his word, that he would not take any ſteps againſt Lord Darn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley which might interfere with her preſent ſtate of negative peace, till ſhe had ſome farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with him. But ſhe was relieved from all apprehenſions of that kind early the next day by a few lines ſhe received from him, in which he bade her a long adieu. He aſſured her that he felt the impropriety of which he had been guilty the proceeding evening, and he entreated her to forgive it, as with his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon a proper ſenſe of his duty had returned; and that leſt he ſhould in another moment of involuntary inebriation be tempted to offend her again in the ſame manner, he had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined on going on board the Melville Caſtle that day; being reſolved to fulfill to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the confidence repoſed in him. He would willingly, he added, loſe his life in her defence; but he owed the preſent preſervation of it to the intereſts of Colonel Stuart, and his family; he was intruſted by them with the depoſit of
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:030497_0126_0FE6F6A394A2DA28"/>
their future fortune; it was a ſacred engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which, when once fulfilled, would leave him nothing to hope for, and nothing to fear.</p>
               <p>In a ſhort poſtſcript he added, that his deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was to return to England as ſoon as he had ſeen Mr. Stuart, and received his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; when he would find out if poſſible where ſhe reſided, and in what ſituation. He concluded thus abrubtly, as if fearful of ſaying more than he intended; yet it was eaſy to trace his bewildered mind in every line.</p>
               <p>Lady Jane had certainly an attachment for Lord Darnley; but it was rather the compulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of gratitude, than the effuſion of love. She had lately obſerved in him an air of conſtraint, and ſometimes of moroſeneſs, that ſhe had not before perceived; yet ſhe conſidered it both her duty and inclination to apprize Lord Darn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of their interview. He pauſed while ſhe related it; then ſeeming ſuddenly to recollect himſelf, adviſed her if poſſible to marry Glen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cairn. He did not, he ſaid, mean to keep up the boyiſh farce of deceiving her; but he could not in honour to himſelf, or juſtice to his daughter, marry her himſelf. His fortune ſhe knew was not large. Yet he could ſpear out of it an annuity of one hundred pounds, which he would ſettle on her in addition to whatever allowance might be made her by Mr. Martin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale, after the divorce bill had paſſed. She muſt not, he added, expect to ſee him ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently as ſhe had hitherto done; it might
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:030497_0127_0FE6F6A3985D9068"/>
prevent his forming an HONOURABLE connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which he owed to the infancy and ſituation of his daughter.</p>
               <p>Lady Jane liſtened to this ſpeech in ſilent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment; and, when it was over, ironical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thanked his lordſhip for the KINDNESS of his intentions; but aſſured him that it was the laſt time ſhe would degrade herſelf by ſeeing him. With an air of dignity, uncontaminated by paſſion of any kind, ſhe commanded him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, and never more to inſult her either by his preſence, or his offers of miſplaced generoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or wound her feelings by unmerited con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. She was at leaſt his equal in point of rank; and in ſentiment, far his ſuperior. She loved the little Louiſa with almoſt the ſame maternal tenderneſs ſhe ſhould have felt, had Heaven bleſſed her with a child; but her pride had been too groſsly inſulted to allow her to give farther proofs of it. She repeated her wiſh of ſeeing him no more, and with haughty, but determined reſolution, forbade him to intrude farther on her preſence.</p>
               <p>Lord Darnley looked abaſhed, and mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; he endeavoured to ſtammer out an excuſe; but finding it would avail nothing, he made a low bow and withdrew.</p>
               <p>In new, and alarming aſſaults of fortune, if there be leiſure for reflection, the mind retires into its citadel; and there, rejecting every uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs or ordinary companion, admits alone thoſe rare energetic powers, whoſe vigour can repel,
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:030497_0128_0FE6F6A4B79FB348"/>
or vigilance elude, the fury of the ſtorm. In ſuch a dilemma, ſhe naturally thought of Glen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cairn; not as the future happy rival of Lord Darnley; not as her champion, whom ſhe might expect to find bold in his revenge of her injuries;—but, as a friendly divinity, whoſe ſoothing pity, if it could not diſſipate, would at leaſt effuſe a ſympathetic balm. Yet it was not until after ſome ſtruggles that ſhe determined to write, and requeſt ſeeing him once more; and diſpatched Tom with a letter to that effect, to Black-wall.</p>
               <p>He loſt no time after receiving it in obeying her ſummons; and drew from her full a confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her intimacy with Lord Darnley, and his ſubſequent conduct. He ſaid little in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, but ſoon after excuſed himſelf on pretence of buſineſs which would detain him half an hour, and went directly to Lord Darnley's lodging, determined to demand ſatisfaction for the ungentlemanly and cruel treatment that he had exerted towards an unhappy and unprotect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed woman. His lordſhip having probably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained ſome ſuſpicions on that head, had paid off his lodgings, and left town an hour before Glencairn arrived there.</p>
               <p>Cruelty and cowardice are ſo cloſely connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as to be deemed almoſt inſeparable. The man who would wantonly torture and deſtroy even the leaſt of God's creatures, will be ſeldom found to poſſeſs that degree of courage which naturally belongs to the Lord of the creation, and which habitual vice only can do away.
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:030497_0129_0FE6F6A4C0595EE8"/>
He will tyrannize over thoſe unhappy victims whom the chance of fortune has rendered ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to his power; but he will ſhrink from thoſe who can reign over HIM, and ſtand aghaſt at the appearance of ſuperior virtue. A man of real courage is a man of ſtrict honour; he will, like the tried warrior, pity, and releave as far as he is able, the leſs fortunate vanquiſhed; but he will deſpiſe the pitiful prerogative of exult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over, and adding to, accumulated woes. Such were the oppoſite characters of lord Darn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, and Glencairn.</p>
               <p>In two days more the Melville-Caſtle was to go down the river; and Glencairn's engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were of too ſerious a nature to be broken. He ſaid nothing to Lady Jane of his knowledge of Lord Darnley's departure; but requeſted her to perſevere in not ſeeing him; and advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her to retire to ſome more private lodging, where ſhe might wait the iſſue of the matter now pending in law. He told her that he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to return to England in fifteen or eighteen months; and he begged her not to forget that ſhe had one friend left, who would never deſert her intereſts, though the ſacrifice of his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting peace muſt be made to the memory of her ſufferings, and his own feeble condition. With theſe words he left her, but ah, in what a ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation!—no friends, no ſociety, not even an acquaintance to whom ſhe might pour out her griefs and her mind diſturbed almoſt beyond the powers of reflection! Towards evening ſhe walked out, and her ſteps were involuntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly directed towards Brompton. She would

have paſſed the houſe which contained M<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> Darnley; but by accident ſhe looked up, and ſaw her playing in her nurſe's arms, at the window. She was then about eight months old. Lady Jane could not reſiſt the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but running eagerly up ſtairs; kiſſed her with ardent affection, while the tears ſtream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down her cheeks. The object of her walk was to find out a cheap lodging in a decent fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; in this ſhe ſoon ſucceeded, and took it from the following day.</p>
               <p>She returned home, and was ſitting over a ſlender ſupper, rapt in melancholly ideas, when a loud knock at the ſtreet-door, and a hackney<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> coach ſtopping at it, arreſted her attention. Tom informed her that it was an old gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who declined ſending up his name, but particularly requeſted to ſee her. She was in that ſtate of torpid inſenſibility which renders us alike indifferent to every thing, and ſhe gave orders that he ſhould be admitted. This unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected viſitor was old Mr. Martindale; at ſight of him her tears flowed afreſh, but he bade her be comforted. Nothing, he ſaid, that lay within HIS power ſhould be wanting to ſoften the rigour of her deſtiny. He had called to aſſure her of it; and would repeat his viſits, though he wiſhed his family might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ignorant of them. The ſettlement, he ſaid, of two thouſand pounds per annum that had been made on her marriage, and was to deſcend to her in caſe ſhe ſurvived her huſband, would ſtill hold good if there was no divorce, and that ſhe refuſed to ſign any bond that might
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:030497_0131_0FE6F6AED1E4DB38"/>
be propoſed to her, till ſhe had been adviſed how to act. His ſon had been already inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his counſel, that there did not exiſt any juſt plea for a divorce; and he was determined not only to appriſe her of what ſhe ought to do, but alſo from time to time acquaint her with what ſteps were to be taken, and his opinion of them. He ſtaid with her near an hour; and promiſing to call on her next evening at Brompton, took his leave of her with every ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of pity and regard.</p>
               <p>She received the next morning a long conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory letter from Glencairn; but as it contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing more than a repetition of his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and good wiſhes, we will not tranſcribe it; but take for the preſent our leave of him, wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him a proſperous voyage to India, and a ſafe and happy return to Britain.</p>
               <p>Mr. Martindale went as he had promiſed to Brompton; and ſaid he was authoriſed by his ſon to make known to her in what manner he choſe, that he ſhould henceforwards continue to allow her one hundred pounds per annum; and that he had given orders to his banker to pay her immediately five hundred pounds, as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from himſelf. She had hitherto thought of, and now cared, ſo little about pecuniary mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that ſhe was perfectly ſatisfied with his propoſal to execute a deed of ſeparation, that ſhould preclude the poſſibility of her debts falling on her huſband. This was agreed on, and ſigned by both parties the following day, and every thing appeared to be terminated to
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:030497_0132_0FE6F6B159410EB0"/>
the ſatisfaction of all thoſe who were concerned in it.</p>

               <p>FROM the time of Glencairn's departure, Miſs Stuart's health began to relapſe into its former ſtate of declining ſtrength. Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent faintings, loſs of appetite, and a total de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of ſpirits, were the alarming fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of what was ſoon confirmed to be a rapid decline. The Colonel and herſelf received ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral letters from him, and in the laſt, dated from the Downs, he took his long farewell. But theſe, inſtead of aſſuaging her grief at his loſs, viſibly augmented it. She perceived a chilly reſerve in his manner of addreſſing her, that was inconſiſtent ſhe thought with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their engagement; and his ſilence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting Lady Jane Martindale (an account of whom they had ſeen in the papers) was to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the ſureſt proof of his not being indifferent about it. In a few weeks Mr. Courtenay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came their viſitor; but knowing the ſituation of her heart, he dropped all pretenſions to be her lover, and gloried but in the title of her ſincere and ſympathizing friend. He divided with the Colonel his attentions to her; and his naturally cheerful diſpoſition often forced a ſmile from her pale and placid countenance,
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:030497_0133_0FE6F6B15CDD57E0"/>
while it ſeconded the anxious wiſhes of her ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable father, by ſometimes enabling him to aſſume an air of gaiety from which his heart was very far removed.</p>
               <p>Many months paſſed in which their hours were thus uniformly, and not unpleaſingly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided. The Colonel and Mr. Courtenay ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally rode out; and when the cold was not too ſevere (for it was now winter) Miſs Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>art frequently accompanied them behind a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, for ſhe was too weak to venture alone on horſe-back. They had one morning in the month of December extended their ride beyond its uſual bounds, when they were overtaken by a ſudden ſtorm. The hailſtones pelted them with fury, and thick flakes of ſnow fell in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance over them. They found themſelves nine miles from Allanbank, and were obliged to take ſhelter in a ſmall cottage, till they could diſpatch their attendant to the neareſt town where a chaiſe might be procured, and which was at a much greater diſtance. They did not reach home till near ſeven o'clock in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the ſtorm had not yet abated.</p>
               <p>They had but juſt changed their wet clothes, and were ſitting round the blazing fire, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their early ſupper, when <hi>Keeper,</hi> the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful houſe-dog, announced by his loud barking, the unuſual appproach of viſitors. He was ſoon echoed by ſeveral other dogs, whoſe peaceful ſlumbers he had diſturbed, as they lay ſtretched round the comfortable hearth of the hoſpitable parlour. The rain pattered againſt
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:030497_0134_0FE6F6B9CAF1B260"/>
the windows, and the wind loud whiſtled through the trees, which hardly ſuffered them to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the rattling of carriage wheels, till it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached cloſe to the outward gate. Mary's heart firſt bounded high with fluttering expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and then ſunk with dire diſmay.</p>
               <p>The inhabitants of Allanbank ſoon aſſembled at the door; from whence, after a ſhort interval of painful ſuſpence, they could perceive, by the glimmering light of the different candles they held, a female form, which, lightly tripping up the lawn, was enquiring of every one ſhe ſaw, whether Miſs Stuart was there? On be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing anſwered in the affirmative, ſhe flew to her embrace, and, without giving Mary time to recollect herſelf, aſked her if ſhe had quite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten her old friend, Sophia Beaumont?</p>
               <p>Mary drew back with fear, as thinking ſhe beheld her ghoſt; for how could mother St. Etienne, a confirmed nun of one of the ſtricteſt orders in France, be not only liberated from her confinement, but alſo a ſolitary wanderer in a remote part of a kingdom to which ſhe was an entire ſtranger? A moment's pauſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced her; and that moment drew a tear of blood from her heart, as it brought to her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance the ſituation of <hi>perſecuted France!</hi> that country in which ſhe had paſſed ſome of the happieſt hours of unconſcious infancy; where ſhe had ſo often witneſſed the gay dance, the feſtive board, the jocund ſong, and all the ſprightly attributes of light-footed felicity. Alas! how ſad, how bitter, how ſudden,
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:030497_0135_0FE6F6B9CEA02018"/>
how heart-breaking, was now the vaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe!</p>
               <p>Mary welcomed her friend with unfeigned ſatisfaction, and when ſupper was over, Miſs Beaumont began her pathetic narration. She dwelt with pity on the violation of every ſacred inſtitution. The Catholic religion, whoſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward forms pourtrayed the exceſs of romantic ſuperſtition, now ſtood unmaſked, and terrible to view. The ſavage chiefs of France, whoſe <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ands were perpetually employed in ſhedding without mercy the blood of innocents, had laid low the buildings that were devoted to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, and at length dared to deny his name. Nor did ſhe forget (while the tear of pity ſtreamed down her cheeks, and down thoſe of her auditors) the holy ſiſterhood of her now violated, but once ſacred, aſylum. Thoſe aged and venerable nuns, whoſe life had been ſpent within its quiet walls, and who, devoted ſince childhood to their religion, had peaceably and uniformly fulfilled its duties, were now torn by the rough hand of violence from their ſolitary cells, and expoſed to buffet with the ſtorms of a world they had never ſeen, and of which they had coveted only A GRAVE!</p>
               <p>The great clock ſtruck twelve; and, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minding them of the lateneſs of the hour, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed the compaſſionate hearts under the roof at Allanbank from dwelling farther on the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy tale; and Miſs Beaumont, fatigued by her long journey, was glad to retire as ſoon as ſhe had ſatisfied them of the means which brought her thither. An Engliſh family to
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:030497_0136_0FE6F6BC4440DE00"/>
whom ſhe was unknown had conducted her by the way of Oftend to London, and ſupplied her with money more than ſufficient to defray her expences to Scotland. This charming girl, though French by birth, was calculated to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn human nature; her heart recoiled at the horrors exerciſed by her ferocious countrymen, horrors ſo great they want a name, and beggar all deſcription!</p>

               <p>IT would be difficult to meet with minds more perfectly congenial than were thoſe of Mary Stuart and Sophia Beaumont. They were charmed with the ſociety of each other, yet Miſs Beaumont's delicacy was wounded by her being wholly dependent on her friends. From this motive ſhe wiſhed, after a few months reſidence at Allanbank, to remove from it till ſuch time as ſhe might be able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw her ſlender fortune out of the hands of her family. She was an adept at all kinds of needle-work, and thought it might be practica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for her to gain a maintenance at Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh; but Miſs Stuart's precarious ſtate of health would not permit her to hint at it. She was every day ſomewhat weaker than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer one; yet with that flattering hope which is almoſt conſtantly attendant on her fatal diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſhe derived the moſt ſanguine expectations of her recovery with the approaching ſpring. Miſs Beaumont and Mr. Courtenay were inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigably attentive to her; but the Colonel was too well aware of her danger, not to ſtand himſelf in need of that aſſiſtance he endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give his dying daughter.</p>
               <p>Let ſtoicks enjoy their frigid inſenſibility,
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:030497_0138_0FE6F6C6CD88B4D8"/>
and philoſophers boaſt the command of paſſions they never felt; but where is the heart endued with NATURAL TENDERNESS, that could have refrained ſympathizing with Miſs Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont in her feelings for her friend?—Courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay's could not. His admiration of her amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſpoſition, which was ſo feelingly diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on this melancholy occaſion, led him by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to a more tender ſentiment, which he had ſome reaſon to think did not remain long unnoticed by the lovely Sophia.</p>
               <p>It was an union that Miſs Stuart ardently wiſhed; and the deep bluſhes which had once overſpread Miſs Beaumont's face on hearing his name inadvertently mentioned, confirmed her in the opinion ſhe had formed of their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual attachment. I have already ſaid that Mr. Courtenay poſſeſſed a conſiderable fortune in Ireland; but his generous ſoul diſdained the idea of hoarding money, and it was not unuſual for him to exceed the bounds of his income by deeds of charity and benevolence. He was at this time about fifty years of age; and had ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ſufficiently about the world, to wiſh to be at length quietly ſettled in it. He had partly determined on going to Ireland for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, when he ſaw Miſs Beaumont. His paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for Miſs Stuart had worn away in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as his hopes of being united to her dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</p>
               <p>Miſs Stuart ſent for him one morning into her dreſſing-room; and taking from a drawer a miniature of herſelf that had been done in Italy
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:030497_0139_0FE6F6C6D2145B60"/>
(and which, contrary to her expectation, Glen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cairn had not aſked for at his departure), pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented it to him. She requeſted that he would give it to Miſs Beaumont; adding, that ſhe was greatly miſtaken in her conjectures if ſhe did not receive it with additional ſatisfaction from his hands.</p>
               <p>This ſpeech was too flattering to the wiſhes of Mr. Courtenay, to be miſunderſtood by him. His next care, after giving the picture as deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was to open his mind to Colonel Stuart, and to repeat to him what had paſſed. The young ladies had already come to an explanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on the ſubject; and before evening it was reſolved on, with the hearty concurrence of all parties, that Mr. Courtenay ſhould receive the hand of Sophia.</p>
               <p>In leſs than three weeks he had made an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable ſettlement on his fair intended; and ſoon after, the marriage was ſolemnized. Miſs Stuart inſiſted on being preſent at the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but fainted before it was over, and was with difficulty conveyed from the church to her chamber. Her heart rejoiced at the happineſs of her friend: but it brought ſad recollections to her mind, and was near ſubduing the little ſtrength that was left her. Mr. Courtenay hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a ſmall houſe that was fortunately vacant in the neighbourhood of Allanbank, as they were determined not to leave Miſs Stuart till the curtain of death had been gently drawn o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the laſt ſcene of her exiſtence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="unknown:030497_0140_0FE6F6C80C4BA4E0"/>They had been ſettled there about ten months, and Mrs. Courtenay's ſituation was ſuch as to require every precaution and care that a fond huſband, and anxious friend, could beſtow on it, when it unfortunately happened that ſhe was one evening ſitting with Miſs Stuart in her apartment, and the London newſpapers arrived. Mrs. Courtenay opened them, and began to read; but had not proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed far, when ſhe ſaw the words Melville Caſtle. Eager to ſatisfy her own impatience, and that of her unhappy friend, ſhe began to go through the paragraph; but ſtopped in the middle of it, gave a loud ſcream, and fell in hyſterics on the floor. Her cries ſoon brought the ſervants up ſtairs, who were followed by the Colonel and Mr. Courtenay. The fatal myſtery was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly revealed; the alarming paragraph ſtat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the Melville Caſtle was arrived ſafe at Madras; but that a boat belonging to her had ſunk at the entrance of the harbour, and that all the perſons on board had unfortunately pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed.</p>
               <p>Miſs Stuart diſplayed the moſt heroic forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude on this occaſion; her fears for her friend ſuperſeded every ſelfiſh pang, and ſhe ſeemed to ſoar above mortality. She ſhed no tears, but ſweetly ſmiled as Mrs. Courtenay recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and even endeavoured to perſuade them that ſhe had a preſentiment of Glencairn's not being of the number of thoſe unhappy paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. A premature delivery, and the death of her child, were the only ill conſequences that befel Mrs. Courtenay; and which, by detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

her at Allanbank, was not unaccompanied by conſolation to Miſs Stuart, who was too ill to viſit at her houſe, and derived her greateſt comfort on attending her, in a room adjoining to her own. Mrs Courtenay ſoon recovered; but it was to witneſs a ſcene which, though ſhe had long expected, ſhe was ill prepared for. Miſs Stuart found herſelf one day ſo much better, that ſhe requeſted they would all indulge her by dining in her room. She had dreſſed herſelf to receive, as ſhe ſaid, her viſitors, with unuſual care. When dinner was over, ſhe deſired Mr. Courtenay to lead her to the piano-forte; when faintly touching the diſcordant ſtrings, ſhe endeavoured to go through her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite air,
<q>I know that my Redeemer liveth,</q>
which ſhe attempted to accompany with her voice; but her ſtrength failed in the attempt, and ſhe ſunk motionleſs on the chair. When ſhe came to herſelf, ſhe affectingly took a hand of her father's, and repeatedly preſſed it to her lips. She then for the firſt time acknowledged to them all, that ſhe was ſenſible of her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching diſſolution. She begged the Colonel would comply with her requeſt, and, in caſe of Glencairn's returning to England, that he would make him his heir; ſaying, ſhe could not die in peace unleſs ſhe obtained the promiſe of that which lay neareſt to her heart. In half-broken ſentences he aſſured her of it, and bade her be comforted.</p>

                  <pb n="143" facs="unknown:030497_0142_0FE6F6D1CBED96C0"/>Towards evening ſhe begged of Mr. Courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay to read prayers to her, and deſired that all the ſervants might be called up ſtairs to join in the pious ſcene. Soon after they were over, ſhe called Mr. and Mrs. Courtenay, and the Colonel, round her chair; and embraced the two former as ſhe prayed of God to bleſs them. But when her father drew near; when ſhe felt his arms clinging round her waiſt, as if to ſhield her from the tyrant who was advancing with haſty ſteps to ſeparate them for ever, ſhe faintly articulated the word <hi>farewell;</hi> her head ſunk on his boſom, and with a deep and heavy ſigh <hi>ſhe expired!</hi>

They laid her gently on the bed, and applied a mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to her lips. But the faithful moniter refuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to deceive.

               <p>MRS. Courtenay reſigned to her huſband the melancholy office of conſoling the afflicted Colonel, who vainly endeavoured to reconcile himſelf to the ſad ſeparation. He however derived comfort from the idea that it could not be of long duration, for he felt that he ſhould not long ſurvive his Mary. He took a mournful pleaſure in decorating her ſenſeleſs corſe with ſuch flowers as his humble green-houſe could ſupply. He watched the ſad proceſſion as it moved from the houſe; at the head of it, was the faithful M'Kenzie, bending her palſied frame towards the earth in ſpeechleſs woe. Mr. Courtenay ſupported her; nor did his manly countenance loſe ſight of its dignity while overſpread with the tears of affection and ſympathy. Eight young Highland girls bore the precious burden to its deſtined home; and the ſolemn ſcene was conducted with that ſilent awe which intermingles itſelf with pious reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the inſcrutable will of Heaven.</p>
               <p>The ceremony over, the mourners return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and by degrees, Mr. and Mrs. Courtenay left Colonel Stuart's houſe to inhabit once more their own. Yet they continued as one family, and omitted nothing that could tend towards
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:030497_0144_0FE6F6D2E6021658"/>
alleviating the diſtreſſes of their venerable friend. But this care was not long allotted them. In a few weeks, Colonel Stuart entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to give up their houſe, and to take poſſeſſion of Allanbank; conſidering it as their depoſit till, by the unavoidable arrangement of his affairs, it might hereafter become neceſſary, through Glencairn's return, for them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh it.</p>
               <p>He ſoon after made his will, and diſpoſed of every thing as his daughter had directed; allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting only ſome trifling legacies to Mr. and Mrs. Courtenay; a ſmall but ſufficient annuity to Mrs. M'Kenzie; and remembrances to his other domeſtics in proportion to their age and ſervices. He farther ſtipulated, that in caſe of Glencairn's death without iſſue, his whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty was to devolve to Mrs. Courtenay, and HER heirs for ever. The buſineſs of life being finally ſettled, the excellent Colonel Stuart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned his breath, while glorifying his Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that had heard his prayer, and was going to reſtore him to his Mary.</p>
               <p>Mr. and Mrs. Courtenay remained in quiet poſſeſſion of Allanbank. Exemplary patterns of domeſtic felicity, they had already paſſed three years there; during which Heaven bleſſed them with two children; nor did they know a day's ſeparation, till Mr. Courtenay went to Ireland for ſix weeks, on buſineſs relative to his own affairs. His amiable Sophia refuſed all ſociety but that of her children and the worthy M'Kenzie; who being now too old to interfere
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:030497_0145_0FE6F6D2EB654890"/>
in houſehold management, was become her conſtant companion. They could not hear of Glencairn, though they had uſed every endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to know his fate, on the return of the Melville Caſtle. All they could diſcover, was, that he was not of the number of the drowned paſſengers in the boat. They had landed him at Madras; and from their not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received any tidings of him ſince, they concluded that he was either removed to ſome more diſtant part of India, or died ſoon after his arrival there. But they did not appropriate any part of his intended fortune to their own uſe; they ſtudiouſly endeavoured to accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, and enjoyed the pleaſing, diſintereſted hope, that ſtill exiſted, of his return to the full enjoyment of it.</p>
               <p>Let us now revert to the ill-treated Lady Jane Martindale; who, hurried progreſſively from one falſe ſtep to another, found many Lord Darnleys, but few friends. Old Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tindale frequently viſited her; but ſhocking to relate! ſoon convinced her, by his propoſals, of the depravity of his mind. He told her that her future fortune was in his hands, and that he would provide for, or forſake her, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to her treatment of him. He queſtioned her as to the ſtate of her preſent finances; and on finding that her thoughtleſs extravagance had reduced them to the loweſt ebb, he threw a fifty pound not on the table, and endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to extort from horror and fear, a ſacrifice that in a generous breaſt muſt be ever ſacred to love alone.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="unknown:030497_0146_0FE654EE91654EE0"/>Fallen as ſhe already was in her own eſteem, and in that of others, ſhe yet could not hear a ſentiment ſo degrading to humanity, without feeling a mixture of terror and ſurpriſe. Though reduced to the laſt exigences, ſhe would fain have returned the note to its deſpicable owner: but he inſiſted on leaving it; and, ſhewing evident ſymptoms of diſappointment and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſoon after took his leave.</p>
               <p>Lady Jane gave herſelf up a prey to inward deſpair, and outward diſſipation. While the tears roſe in crimſon torrents from her heart, ſhe wildly decorated her perſon with the inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of joy; and ſought a tranſitory relief in falſe pleaſures, while ſhe continued to be a ſtranger to every real one. The doors that ſheltered virtue, were cloſely barred againſt her approach; thoſe of vice, only, ſtood upon to receive her. In every new lover, ſhe ſought a friend; in every new lover, ſhe gained an enemy. She had heard of Miſs Stuart's death, but to Glencairn's fate ſhe was wholly indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. Several weeks elapſed without her hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing more of old Mr. Martindale; and ſo invincible was her preſent averſion to him, that although from motives of prudence ſhe was with-held from publickly expoſing him, ſhe rejoiced at her deliverance from the ſight of ſo unworthy, ſo unprincipled a relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>She was one day waited on by an elderly gentleman, whoſe appearance prejudiced her warmly in his favour. He ſpoke the language
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:030497_0147_0FE6F6DD18FD3F50"/>
of pity, and of friendly advice; ſounds to which ſhe had been long unaccuſtomed. After the neceſſary introduction, he informed her that Mr. Martindale, ſenior, died ſuddenly two days before, in an apoplectic fit, and that his will had been that morning read<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a codicil was found to have been lately added to it, by which he ratified to Lady Jane the enjoyment of the two thouſand pounds per annum, in caſe of her ſurviving her huſband; but that he had not bequeathed her, for temporary ſupplies, any legacy whatever.</p>
               <p>Lady Jane cared ſo little about worldly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, that ſhe heard of this diſappointment without the leaſt diſcompoſure. Her mind had now yielded to that ſtate of hurried perplexity, that did not allow her time to reflect on all the miſeries attending her hapleſs ſituation. She had taken an elegant houſe in town; and its expences were unceaſingly defrayed by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſucceſſors to her attention. All inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe between her and the little Louiſa Darn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley had been long ſince prohibited by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeling lord; who, callous to misfortunes of which he had been a principle author, now wantonly regarded her, wherever he met her, with the piercing look of ineffable contempt. The affection ſhe once bore him was totally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literated; and ſhe could meet him and Miſs Fielding together, which was not unuſual<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding them with the ſame degree of contempt which they did not fail manifeſting towards her upon every occaſion.</p>

                  <pb n="149" facs="unknown:030497_0148_0FE6F6DE295C8040"/>A black coach, and all the outward trappings of woe, were the tokens by which ſhe ſoon deſcried Mrs. Martindale; who daily paraded the Park and Bond-ſtreet with all the ſolemnity of DECENT widowhood. To this was oppoſed the gaudy equipage of Lady Darnley, late Miſs Fielding; but this did not excite in the breaſt of Lady Jane, one ſenſation of ſorrow, envy, or ſurpriſe. Her feelings were howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver powerfully affected by a premeditated inſult ſhe received from Lady Darnley, a few days after her marriage; who having ſtopped her carriage one morning at a ſhop in Bond-ſtreet, was ſpeaking to one of the people at the coach door, when Lady Jane paſſed by. Miſs Darn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley was with her, and eagerly called to Lady Jane; when Lady Darnley ſuddenly drew the ſpring blind, to prevent her enjoying the ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſatisfaction of even looking at her.</p>

               <p>MRS. Martindale did not long remain a widow. Ere the long twelvemonth was expired, during which it was neceſſary for her to ſubmit to the doleful attire, and to put up with a corner of one of her drawing room windows being darkened by a hatchment, ſhe made a promiſe that when once the happy peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od arrived, ſhe would beſtow her hand on a more ſuitable lover than ſhe had found in her old man. Captain O'Trigger, whoſe commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion centered in a daſhing cockade, had paraded his ponies about the city of Bath during ſeveral ſeaſons. But, though the gaming tables were in general propitious to him, the choſen ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were not ſo. The miſſes all vowed, that Captain O'Trigger was the fineſt fellow in Bath; but the mammas and guardians gave him ſo little encouragement, that the Captain at length thought it beſt to beat a precipitate retreat, and try his ſucceſs in London. He was a fine, tall, handſome looking man; neat, but prepoſterous in his dreſs, and fond to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of his perſon. No man knew better than himſelf the names of all the different eſſences and pomatums imported from India and France. From the powerful otto of roſes, down to the more reviving, but more humble lavender wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:030497_0150_0FE6F6E724169620"/>
his dreſſing-room was the repoſitory of them all; which, together with his ponies, a few fans from Italy, and ſome pots of rouge warranted vegetable (the two latter articles he reſerved for the happy fair on whom he might hereafter fix his choice,) compoſed the whole ſtock in trade of this FASHIONABLE MILITARY HERO.</p>
               <p>Captain O'Trigger, whoſe modeſty was not in the habit of laying any embargo on his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, no ſooner beheld our young widow, and was informed who ſhe was, than he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to lay cloſe ſiege to her; and as an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous marriage was the firſt grand object of his purſuit, he was reſolved to transform his character into exactly any one that he might find on father enquiry would be moſt likely to determine her in his favour.</p>
               <p>He began to try the whole battery of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery againſt the vain Mrs. Martindale; firſt, by the aid of a ſmall glaſs, ſuſpended to a black ribbon, and dangling from his neck; with which he aſſailed her wherever ſhe went; while the expreſſion of <hi>a damned fine woman!</hi> was uttered JUST loud enough to catch her ear. At firſt ſhe thought his accents favoured rather too much of the brogue; but at length cuſtom reconciled her to him, and ſhe hazarded not ere long to avow a diſtinguiſhed preference to Captain O'Trigger over the reſt of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors,</p>
               <p>He ſoon became the acknowledged intended
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:030497_0151_0FE6F6E727F03670"/>
of the beautiful widow; not that ſhe cared for him in her heart, but her vanity was gratified at the idea of mortifying her rivals, whom her opinion had magnified into a much greater number than even Captain O'Trigger himſelf could lay reaſonably any claim to.</p>
               <p>The laſt few weeks of Mrs. Martindale's funeral appearance were dedicated to preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for her approaching nuptials; on the ſtrength of which, her favourite Captain was enabled to cut a much greater figure than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. A ſumptuous vis a-vis was building at Hatchett's, by HIS expreſs order; and in which his taſte ſhone conſpicuous. She was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly convinced of the ſincere attachment of this <hi>Knight of Induſtry,</hi> and in giving him her hand, beſtowed on him alſo her OWN houſe in Devonſhire-place; and every appendage of lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury ſhe parted with in his favour, with as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle difficulty as ſhe herſelf had formerly obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them.</p>
               <p>For ſome months the torch of Hymen blazed with unremitting ardour; but the inſtability of human happineſs ſoon overpowered, and at length wholly extinguiſhed it. Mrs. Martin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale (now Mrs. O'Trigger) was fatally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that ſhe was the dupe of a deſigning for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune-hunter; for ſuch in reality was her choſen mate.</p>
               <p>It would be needleſs to detail the many oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences which led to the ſad reverſe of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune ſhe was henceforward fated to undergo.
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:030497_0152_0FE6F6E9B404A680"/>
Her huſband's extravagance manifeſted itſelf at the gaming-tables, and elſewhere. Her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney ſheltered him from a goal, but its ſource was not inexhauſtible; and ſhe had no ſooner deprived herſelf of every future comfort, for his preſervation, than he left her to lament her error in obſcurity and poverty. Captain O'Trigger, after ſelling her houſe and all ſhe was poſſeſt of, at length wholly deſerted her; and the only account ſhe ever after received of him was that of his having returned to a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer wife in Ireland, with whom he had fled to ſome diſtant clime, far beyond the reach of law, juſtice, honour, or humanity.</p>
               <p>Lady Jane Martindale continued for a time to run the giddy round of thoughtleſs diſſipati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but her heart, that had ever unwillingly yielded to its dictates, was ſoon tired of its tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient gratifications, and ſighed after the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſcenes of peaceful retirement. But theſe, alas! were no longer within the boundary of her own acquiſition. She had no friend to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port her tottering ſteps; no ſoothing hand was ſtretched forth to yield her comfort; no conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory parental voice remained to welcome her out of the path of vice, She was, as it were, left alone in the vaſt univerſe; the ſmall ſalary allotted her by Mr. Martindale ſhe duly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; and hitherto temporary additions to it from her acquaintance had not failed her; but ſhe knew theſe could not laſt long, and ſhe had acquired experience enough to teach her that they would exiſt no longer than ſhe was inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:030497_0153_0FE6F6E9B9875F08"/>
to ſacrifice her happineſs to the enjoyment of them.</p>
               <p>In this ſituation, ſhe had already continued ſome years, anxious to exchange it, yet not poſſeſſing reſolution enough to effect it, when ſhe was one morning ſurpriſed by the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Glencairn. He was ſo much altered in perſon, that ſhe had at firſt ſome difficulty to recollect him; but his heart was the ſame. He had already been in Scotland, where he had taken poſſeſſion of Colonel Stuart's <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>tate; ſtill inſiſting, that Mr. and Mrs. Courtenay ſhould not quit Allanbank. His voyage to India had not been proſperous. Mr. Stuart's affairs were, when he arrived there, in ſo deranged a ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that, at his death, which happened ſoon afterwards, they were found to be little worth the trouble that had been taken on their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; and he was at length obliged to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don them, after having obtained but a very ſlender advantage in favour of his friend and patron. But the reſidue of Colonel Stuart's fortune was yet more than ſufficient to anſwer any purpoſe of his own. He had liberality of ſentiment ſufficient to make every allowance in favour of Lady Jane Martindale's miſtaken conduct; and while he could yet entertain the hope of making HER happy, the praiſe, or the cenſure of an ill-judging world were to him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually indifferent.</p>
               <p>He prevailed on her to accompany him to Edinburgh, where ſhe ſoon convinced him that the genuine uprightneſs of her heart had
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:030497_0154_0FE6F6F3E907D090"/>
remained uncontaminated by <hi>faſhionable levity.</hi> Nor was ſhe long there, before, by her admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into a reſpectable family, and the delicate caution obſerved by Glencairn in his viſits to her, ſhe gained that countenance and reſpect which had been wrenched from her in England by the iron hand of cruelty, injuſtice, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. Not a year had paſſed after this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py tranſition, before the death of Mr. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tindale, by liberating her from the moſt ſacred, and moſt abuſed of engagements, enabled her to beſtow her hand, and large encreaſe of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, on him who had ſo nobly deſerved them. The amiable Mrs. Courtenay ſhone forth on this occaſion the bright repreſentative of SPOT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LESS virtue. She knew how to pity thoſe er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors ſhe had never known; and thoſe tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which, as ſhe ſweetly, ſaid, ſhe might not have been able to have withſtood, had fate dealt by her with the ſame ſeverity it had done towards Lady Jane Martindale. The pomp of widowhood would have been but ill diſplayed by that hitherto unfortunate lady. She neither affected the weeds of ſorrow, nor the trophies of joy; but with all the decorum due to her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and to thoſe with whom ſhe was now ſo happily connected ſhe ſurrendered, as ſoon as decency would permit, the name of <hi>Martindale,</hi> and became entitled to the more happy one of <hi>Glencairn.</hi>
