            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>ON December 25, 1698, a number of young perſons, actuated by a love for religion, and a deſire to aſſiſt and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote each other's advancement in the offices of piety, agreed upon "a private weekly meeting, for religious exerciſe, and the good improvement of the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the LORD's day."</p>
            <p>ABOUT eleven years after, as the members had become numerous, and it was inconvenient to aſſemble in one place, it was deemed adviſable to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide; and one branch of the ſociety continued to meet in the ſouth part of the town, and the other in the north.</p>
            <p>THE ſociety is compoſed of ſerious and well diſpoſed youths, who continue members till they form family connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or leave the town. There is no recollection of a ſingle inſtance of the expulſion of an individual for ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:035590_0003_1005F895354FCFD8"/>
or of any one having deſired to leave the ſociety from diſlike. The utmoſt harmony and fraternal affection have prevailed in their meetings: and the inſtitution has been promotive of the happieſt effects in encouraging and aſſiſting youthful piety and practical godlineſs.</p>
            <p>THAT a ſociety conſtituted of perſons whoſe diſpoſitions and principles are apt to be mutable, and eaſily affected and eſtranged by the diſſipations of ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life, ſhould have been zealouſly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported <hi>through a whole century,</hi> is a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance which muſt forcibly excite our admiration. On the termination of this period, the young men of the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der branch of the ſociety requeſted that a diſcourſe might be delivered to them in public, to commemorate the eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment of the Inſtitution, and to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther its views. In compliance with this requeſt the following was written and delivered, and to gratify the ſociety it is now publiſhed.</p>

               <salute>MY DEAR YOUNG FRIENDS,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>TO commemorate the eſtabliſhment of that little fraternity of which you are ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py as to be members, is the deſign of the preſent addreſs. Under the patronage of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence, your ſociety has been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued during ONE HUNDRED YEARS, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intermiſſion or neglect. Within this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, how many inſtitutions of this kind, in neighbouring towns, and elſewhere, have been formed and diſcontinued! The zeal with which they commenced ſoon ſubſided; and the cold and languid ſpirit of the world chilled the fervors of their piety and quenched the flame of their devotion! But the fire of love <hi>here</hi> enkindled, like the lamp of the ſanctuary, has been kept alive and bright; and, as "a light ſhining in a dark place," has diffuſed its cheering influence, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing ſplendor, <hi>through a whole century.</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:035590_0005_1005F89952217EA8"/>
What pleaſure muſt it afford thoſe who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved <hi>this</hi> as the ſchool of their religious diſcipline, and by it were trained for that heavenly ſociety of which they are now mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers—how muſt it enhance the joys of ſuch of your pious predeceſſors as are now in glory,—if we may ſuppoſe them bending their regards, from the exalted ſpheres they fill, to theſe humbler ſcenes, to behold the progreſs and the multiplied benefits of this aſſociation! To find here thoſe ſpiritual exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes commenced and cultivated which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for a participation in their more perfect praiſes and joys! And how muſt <hi>you,</hi> my dear young friends, be encouraged and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated in all the duties and engagements of your retirement, by theſe conſiderations.</p>
            <p>TO ſtrengthen your attachment to this ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and to further its views, I ſhall now call your attention to a few remarks on that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of ſcripture which you will find inſerted in the vi<hi>th Chapter of the Epiſtle to the</hi> HEBREWS, <hi>at the</hi> 11<hi>th and</hi> 12<hi>th verſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="unknown:035590_0006_1005F89BF2188620"/>
            <p>"WE DESIRE THAT EVERY ONE OF YOU DO SHEW THE SAME DILIGENCE TO THE FULL ASSURANCE OF HOPE UNTO THE END.</p>
            <p>"THAT YE BE NOT SLOTHFUL, BUT FOLLOWERS OF THEM WHO THROUGH FAITH AND PATIENCE INHERIT THE PROMISES."</p>
            <p>THIS epiſtle includes a variety of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting advice: but its general view and ultimate ſcope appear to be, ſo to eſtabliſh the faith and animate the zeal of the Hebrew converts to chriſtianity, that they might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue firm and unſhaken in the holy profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which they had embraced. They lived in a diſſolute age. The prejudices of their own nation, and the corruption and infidelity of the world around them, expoſed them to many difficulties and dangers. Thoſe who were faithful to GOD and the Redeemer, and ſteadily adhered to the cauſe of truth and duty, had before them only the gloomy proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of public neglect or contempt; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſhment of perſonal eaſe and ſafety, the forfeiture of property, or the loſs of life. To allay their fears, to compoſe their minds to fortitude and magnanimity, and to deter them from the ſhame and guilt of apoſtacy, the ſtrongeſt and moſt weighty arguments,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:035590_0007_1005F89E6B0707A8"/>
the moſt powerful and affecting diſſuaſives, were neceſſary. And ſuch the Apoſtle uſed, to confirm them in a reſolute adherence to the truth as it was in Jeſus. To encourage them to "hold faſt the profeſſion of their faith without wavering,"<note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. x. 23.</note> and to preſerve them from "an evil heart of unbelief,"<note n="†" place="bottom">Heb. iii. 12.</note> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minds them of the ſuperior excellency of <hi>Chriſt</hi> the miniſter of the goſpel diſpenſation, not only to Moſes the founder of the Jewiſh economy, but even to the Angels who were employed in its promulgation.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Chap. i.</note> He mentions the higher and more eminent advantages re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting from the goſpel; that it would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce nobler effects, that it opened brighter proſpects, that it was enriched with much better promiſes, and that it had in reverſion an inheritance of heavenly rewards. And, that he might leave no motive untried that could ſerve to excite their ambition and fire their zeal, he bids them contemplate the conduct and recollect the ſucceſs of thoſe who had finiſhed their courſe with honor, and through faith and patience had gone to inherit the promiſes; urging them to be followers of their ſteps, that they alſo
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:035590_0008_1005F8A1CBF93368"/>
might arrive at the ſame height of glory and happineſs.</p>
            <p>JUSTLY are the examples of great and illuſtrious perſons, who were remarkable for the ſuperior ſtrength and conſtancy of their virtue, held in high veneration, and propoſed as patterns for the reſt of mankind to copy after. Such examples both inſtruct and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade; excite admiration, inſpire reſolution, and prompt to excel. They ſhew the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cability of improvements in virtue, and offer the greateſt encouragements to a holy dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in religion, by preſenting us with a view of its happy iſſue; they perſuade us to tread in the paths in which others have found the way to eternal glory; and they aſſure us that if we gladly and eagerly follow them the ſame way, we may hope hereafter to meet in the ſame happy ſociety, and be joint in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritors of the ſame promiſes.</p>
            <p>CHRISTIANS are now "heirs of the promiſes." In <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>patience</hi> they paſs the ſcene of their trial. Their virtue exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed and improved, and their warfare finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they receive the reward of their faith in the ſalvation of their ſouls, and go to inherit
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:035590_0009_1005F88D82848800"/>
the proffered bliſs. Then, their <hi>faith</hi> is changed into ſight, and their <hi>patient endur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> into joyful triumph. They took the courſe of piety and holineſs, in which I truſt we are progreſſing. They did well. They got ſafe to heaven, where all of us profeſs a deſire to go. ?Who but would follow? They have and enjoy; while we wait and hope. From their holy walk and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation while they tabernacled in the fleſh, be encouraged, my brethren, to take direction how to ſteer your courſe to reach the manſions they now inhabit; there to be joined with them, not as companions in <hi>tribulation</hi> and <hi>patience,</hi> but in the delights of endleſs praiſe and joyful love. As it was, and muſt be ſtill their "deſire that every one of you ſhould ſhew the ſame diligence to the full aſſurance of hope to the end;" be perſuaded not to be "ſlothful." Be not negligent of your duty, nor indolent in its performance. Do not ſit down in ſluggiſh eaſe, or careleſs idleneſs; indiſpoſed to action, or heedleſs of your progreſs. Loſe not your opportunities. "Be up and doing with all your might what your hands find to do, while it is called to day, for the night of death cometh wherein no one can work." Make it the buſineſs of your
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:035590_0010_1005F8A4611DE7C0"/>
lives to ſerve GOD and do his will with holy earneſtneſs, alacrity and vigor. Loiter not on the way to heaven; but run with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence the race ſet before you. Let nothing retard or hinder your progreſs. Suffer noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to interfere with your obtaining the prize promiſed to the active, the faithful, and the perſevering. Be animated and quickened in its purſuit by the attractive influence of <hi>their</hi> example and ſucceſs, who have ſo run as to obtain. Poſſeſs your minds with ſuch high ideas of the incalculable value of the prize, as not to be diſcouraged by any hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips you may have to encounter in order for obtaining it. ?Do you meet with trials and hindrances? Recollect <hi>their</hi> patience undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed with ſufferings, and <hi>their</hi> zeal riſing ſuperior to all oppoſition, who through much tribulation have entered the kingdom of heaven. Should theſe trials prove ſo ſevere that "even the youths begin to faint and to tire, let them wait upon the Lord and renew their ſtrength;" and by his aſſiſtance they ſhall "run and not be weary, and walk and not faint."<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſai. xl. 30, 31.</note> While you have <hi>faith</hi> to direct,

               <hi>patience</hi> to endure, and <hi>diligence</hi> to execute, you may ſucceſsfully accompliſh the whole work of virtue. While you order your foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps according to GOD's word, and put a firm truſt and reliance upon him who "giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might increaſeth ſtrength," you may be ſure to finiſh your courſe with joy.

Make that your counſellor and guide.

                  <hi>THE celebrated JOHN LOCKE, Eſq. in a letter, written the year before his death, to one who aſked this queſtion</hi>—?"What is the ſhorteſt and ſureſt way for a young man to attain to the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Chriſtian religion?"—<hi>made this anſwer,</hi> "Let him ſtudy the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> eſpecially the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi> Therein are contained the words of eternal life.

                  <hi>Doctor JAMES BAKER;</hi> whoſe liberality was extended to both the ſocieties.</note> Profit by his munificence, in the improvement of thoſe means he has put into your hands to get wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and, by the frequent and careful pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſal of your little library, furniſh your minds to a ſpiritual and divine intelligence.</p>
            <p>WHILE hours ſpent in idleneſs or diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion leave behind them a painful void, or a ſharp ſting; hours thus employed are always recollected with pleaſure.</p>
            <p>IT is with inexpreſſible ſatisfaction that I perceive a ſpirit of ſerious piety prevailing amongſt you. I conſider it as a token of the greateſt good to yourſelves, to your friends, and to the church of Chriſt. It will, in all probability, have a prevailing influence over you through the whole courſe of your life. When you have arrived at years of maturity,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:035590_0014_1005F8AFD8695FD8"/>
you will retain the religious impreſſions made in your priviledged retirement, and recollect the many ſolemn and affecting leſſons there read to you.</p>
            <p>IF you now ſerve GOD with cheerfulneſs, the time will come when obedience to his laws will conſtitute your higheſt felicity. Every virtue you now poſſeſs will acquire ſtrength and vigor, till you arrive at the meaſure of the ſtature of perfect men in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>WHILST, with every grateful ſentiment, you record the origin of this Society and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect the encouragement it has met and the advantages it has effected, be perſuaded ſtill to keep it alive, and to add to its credit and its uſefulneſs. Let not its commendable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject be loſt by your neglect, or defeated by your miſimprovement: but ſhew the ſame diligence with its pious founders; and exert the like ſtudious care, with which they were impreſſed, to promote practical godlineſs, and eſtabliſh in yourſelves and others the full aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of chriſtian hope. !O let your hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orable eſteem for them and reſpect for their memory be improved this way!—!Let them

And may your religious and pious zeal not only capacitate you to fill <hi>their</hi> places well who have graced this ſociety, but prompt you to tranſmit the inſtitution to your <hi>ſucceſſors</hi> in all its purity and advantages; that it may diffuſe the ſpirit of piety and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion through all ſucceeding generations to the end of the world.</p>
            <p>I WILL not anticipate the pleaſures and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comiums of poſterity when <hi>they</hi> ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template the origin and review the progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſtages of this Inſtitution.

At that time, my brothers, your piety and zeal will be recollected and acknowledged with a gratitude and joy like that <hi>we</hi> feel for your predeceſſors.</p>
            <p>TO conclude: GOD hath given us, my hearers, exceeding great and precious prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſes.

While with an eye of faith we ſee the promiſes afar off, let us eagerly deſire and preſs after them. Among theſe are the pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſurances of meeting in a happy ſociety compoſed of "the general aſſembly and church of the firſt born which are written in heaven."<note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. xiii. 23.</note>
            </p>
            <p>LET the joyful deſire of being raiſed and united to this bleſſed company, the ardent ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude to obtain this illuſtrious inheritance, animate us to the cultivation of every good diſpoſition, and to the practice of every good work. Yes,—let us look up to the aſſembly of the bleſſed who ſurround the throne of GOD—to whom we are to conform, with whom we hope to be united. If there be <hi>honor,</hi> ſurely it muſt be found in ſuch an union, and if there be <hi>praiſe,</hi> ſurely it muſt be that of following their ſteps. See, they beckon us—"come up hither." They unfold to us the golden portals of the temple on high; invite us to the manſions of bleſſedneſs; and ſhew us the unfading crown of glory which ſhall be placed on the head of every perſevering and triumphant chriſtian. Conſider yourſelves, my friends, as candidates for theſe honors. Often ſoar beyond the precincts of mortality,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:035590_0017_1005F8A6E111AED8"/>
and have your converſation in heaven. Raiſe your thoughts a little, and ſurvey your priv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iledges. Contemplate the animating promiſes and proſpects of the goſpel. Dwell upon its joyous hopes. Send your warm deſires to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that bliſsful world, and that glorious ſociety of the juſt made perfect. Cheriſh an inward, lively wiſh to dwell among them and ſhare their pleaſures. Be continually looking, aſpiring, longing for the celeſtial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, till GOD by his grace ſhall have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly prepared you for the promiſed glory.</p>
            <p>"FINALLY, brethren, I commend you to GOD, and to the word of his grace which is able to build you up, and to give you an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance among all them which are ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified."</p>

            <head>APPENDIX.</head>
            <p>"Let us be like minded—walk by the ſame rule—and mind the ſame thing."</p>
            <p>FROM a little book, publiſhed about the beginning of the preſent century, entitled "Private meetings ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated and regulated," the following extracts are made, which may ſerve to ſhew the <hi>original</hi> plan and deſign of ſuch inſtitutions.</p>
            <p>"THERE is yet another ſort of <hi>private meetings,</hi> which ought with a more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary zeal to be recommended and encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged; namely, the YOUNG MENS' MEET<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGS.</p>
            <p>THESE duly managed, have been incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable <hi>nurſeries</hi> unto the <hi>churches,</hi> where the faithful paſtors have been careful to animate them and regulate them. How often have we heard thoſe that have joined unto our churches, declaring the vaſt influence which the <hi>young mens' meetings</hi> have had upon them, to engage them and confirm them, in the right ways of the Lord, and reſcue them from the pathes of the deſtroyer; and bleſſing the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious name of GOD, that ever they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with ſuch precious opportunities! <hi>Parents,</hi> encourage your children: <hi>Maſters,</hi> encourage your ſervants; to get as ſoon, and as much as they well can, into ſuch precious opportunities. Young men are hereby preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from very many temptations; and they
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:035590_0019_1005F8BA1B3D3888"/>
are alſo prepared mightily for ſuch religious exerciſes as will be expected from them, when they come themſelves to be houſeholders. Never did any one miniſter in the world, that encouraged ſuch meetings among his young men, ſee cauſe to repent of what he did: we are ſure, the great numbers of them lately erected in the city of London, have been the crown and the joy of them that have been concerned in them. And ſuch a miniſter would beſt preſerve his reputation with the wiſer winners of ſouls, who ſhall not go to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearten the <hi>young men</hi> of his flock, from ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and humble purpoſes in this way to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify one another in the things that accompany ſalvation.</p>
            <p>WE will only make a tender of ſome <hi>orders</hi>; which may be, all or moſt of them well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in ſuch a ſociety: and then, let any man living, who has the fear of GOD before his eyes, declaim, if he can, againſt the deſign of erecting <hi>young mens' meetings,</hi> for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of religion.</p>
            <p n="1">I. LET there be two hours in the evening ſet apart; and let there be two prayers made by the members of the ſociety in their turns; between which, let a ſermon be repeated; and there may be the ſinging of a pſalm annexed.</p>
            <p n="2">II. LET all the members of the ſociety re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to be charitably watchful over one
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:035590_0020_1005F8BBD3D81018"/>
another; never to divulge one anothers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities; always to inform and adviſe one another of every thing that may appear to call for an admonition, and to take it kindly when they are admoniſhed.</p>
            <p n="3">III. LET all who are to be admitted as members of the ſociety, be accompanied by two or three of the reſt, unto the miniſter of the place, that they may receive his holy counſels and charges, and that every thing may be done with his approbation; and ſo let their names be added unto the roll.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. IF any perſon thus enrolled among them, fall into a ſcandalous iniquity, let the rebukes of the ſociety be diſpenſed unto him; and let them forbid him, to come any more among them, until they bring ſuitable expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and evidences of repentance with them.</p>
            <p n="5">V. LET the liſt be once in a quarter called over; and then, if it be obſerved, that any of the ſociety have much abſented themſelves, let there be ſome ſent unto them to inquire the reaſon of the abſence; and if no reaſon be given but ſuch as intimates an apoſtaſy from good beginnings, let them upon obſtinacy, after loving and faithful admonitions, be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literated.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. ONCE in three months, let there be, if need be, a collection, out of which the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary charges of the ſociety ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayed,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:035590_0021_1005F8C117F56470"/>
and the reſt employed upon ſuch pious uſes, as may be agreed upon.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. ONCE in two months, let the whole evening be devoted unto ſupplications for the converſion and ſalvation of the riſing genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the land; and particularly for the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the goſpel, in that congregration, whereto the ſociety does belong.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. LET the whole ſociety, be exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly careful, that their diſcourſe while they are together, after the other ſervices of relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion are over, have nothing in it, that ſhall have any taint of backbiting, or vanity, or the leaſt relation to the affairs of government, or to things which do not concern them, and do not ſerve the intereſts of holineſs in their own converſation. But let their diſcourſe be wholly on the matters of religion; and thoſe alſo, not the diſputable and controverſal mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but the points of practical piety. They may propoſe queſtions upon this intention, and every one in an orderly manner, take his liberty to anſwer them.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. LET every perſon in the ſociety, look upon it, as a ſpecial taſk incumbent on him, to look out for ſome other hopeful young man, and uſe all proper pains to engage him in the reſolutions of godlineſs, until he alſo ſhall be joined unto the ſociety. And when a ſociety ſhall in this way be increaſed unto a
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:035590_0022_1005F8C2A51DB968"/>
fit number, let it ſwarm into more; who may hold an uſeful correſpondence with one another.</p>
            <p>AS arrows in the hand of a mighty man, ſo will young men conſtellated into ſuch meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings be unto the paſtor that ſhall bring his vicinity to be filled with them. Happy is the paſtor that has his quiver full of them; they need not be aſhamed of what they do; they may ſay to their enemies, that which may ſhame them out of their inconſiderate enmity.</p>
            <p>AND now, bring forth your ſtrong reaſon, if you have any, O ye men of ſloth, who are wiſer than the men that can render a reaſon: What reaſon can be brought, againſt ſuch ſocieties? Truly, as it was of old argued, that it was a ſign chriſtianity was a good thing, becauſe that ſuch a man as Nero hated it; ſo, the character of thoſe men, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride and explode theſe <hi>private meetings,</hi> is for the moſt part ſuch, that even this would rather afford an argument unto ſerious chriſtians, that it muſt be a good thing to uphold them, and a thing diſagreeable to the ſpirit that rules in this world. In fine:</p>
            <p>THE man who ſhall be the inſtrument of ſetting up ſuch a ſociety in a place, cannot comprehend, unto what a long train of good conſequences, he is become inſtrumental.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:035590_0023_1005F8C44E3E6C60"/>AND they that ſhall in ſuch a ſociety, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether carry on the duties of chriſtianity, and the praiſes of a glorious CHRIST, will have upon themſelves a bleſſed ſympton, that they ſhall be together aſſociated in the heavenly city, and in the praiſes and glories, that ſhall never have an end."</p>
            <p>EXTRACT from a book entitled, "a help to national reformation," giving an account of the religious ſtate of New England; printed in 1705.</p>
            <p>"OUR religious ſocieties increaſe and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. They meet at proper times to pray to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and repeat ſermons, and forward one another in the fear of GOD. They are helpful in doing abundance of good for the advancement of religion in the neighbourhood, and to make the miniſtry much more profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the weekly exerciſe of it."</p>
            <p>AFTER ſpeaking of the <hi>ſocieties of heads of families,</hi> and thoſe for <hi>reformation,</hi> the author obſerves that "the young men in Boſton and its vicinity have formed themſelves in aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations for religious exerciſes, ſigning ſome good rules to be obſerved by them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, much like the orders of the ſocieties of young men in London."<note place="bottom">[AN account of the ſocieties of young men in England, with rules and directions for their uſe, may be found in Baxter's Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Works, Vol. IV.]</note>
