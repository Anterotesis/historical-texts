            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Our <hi>Timothy</hi> is now Addreſs'd by the Aged Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> at this time a Priſoner at <hi>Rome;</hi> with an Epiſtle written by him, a little before his Martyrdom: An Epiſtle, which <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ingeniouſly calls, <hi>Our Apoſtles Laſt Will and Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> In this Epiſtle, Our Apoſtle Exhorts his Excellent and Beloved <hi>Son Timothy;</hi> [a <hi>Son,</hi> he might well call him, having ſo many ways both <hi>Adopted</hi> him, and Inſtructed him:] He Exhorts him to Stedfaſtneſs in the Faith and Work of His Glorious LORD. One Argument, with which he inculcates this Exhortation, is his <hi>Education.</hi> For one Educated in the <hi>Way of Truth,</hi> and in the <hi>Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures,</hi> to forſake the <hi>Way of God,</hi> is worſe than for another to do ſo. From ſuch as are <hi>Well</hi> Educated, there are <hi>Better Things</hi> expected than from others.

But he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo was Converted unto <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> at the ſame time with his deſirable Conſort. They had before this, betimes begun to give their little Son, the <hi>Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures.</hi> An Early Tincture of <hi>Scriptural Piety</hi> thus took the Mind of the <hi>Child.</hi> But when the Parents were brought home to the Bleſſed JESUS, they wholly committed, as it ſeems, their Little <hi>Son,</hi> unto the Care of that Venerable Miniſter, who had been their <hi>Spiritual Father.</hi> Having themſelves got good by a Miniſter of God, they muſt have their Child, in the way of getting the ſame Good.

               <p>I now with ſome Enforcement, can tell my Hearers over again.</p>

               </p>
               <p>I can demand their Attention to ſeveral <hi>Propoſitions;</hi> And ſuch too, as it were to be wiſhed, all our Children were well acquainted with.</p>

There is nothing ſo <hi>Reaſonable</hi> as to be <hi>Religious.</hi> It muſt needs be our Trueſt <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> to make ſure of <hi>Eternal Glory</hi> in another and better World; For we can be ſure of nothing in <hi>this World;</hi> We are ſure, that we

               <p>One main ſtroke in Religion is, FAITH towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Faith</hi> is in the Bible often called by the Name of, <hi>Wiſdom.</hi> 'Tis moſt Juſtly called ſo.

               </p>
               <p>Another main ſtroke in Religion is, REPENTANCE towards God. <hi>Repentance</hi> is a <hi>Reſipiſcence,</hi> of <hi>Growing Wiſe</hi> again. It muſt be <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> to Abhor <hi>Sin,</hi> to Avoid Sin; <hi>Sin</hi> is always <hi>Folly;</hi> To <hi>Sin,</hi> is to <hi>Do very Fooliſhly.</hi> And, <hi>Repentance,</hi> This will <hi>be unto Salvation.</hi>

               <p>There is no man, but what will own, 'Tis the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of every man, to <hi>Save his own Soul:</hi> For, <hi>What is a man profited, if he gain the whole world, and loſe his own Soul?</hi> Now the Iſſue of conformity to the <hi>Rules of Religion,</hi> will be the <hi>Salvation of the Soul.</hi> We read, Heb. 5.9.

               <p n="3">III. The Inference from hence is; That the EARLY KNOWLEDGE of the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> is the way to be BETIMES <hi>made wiſe unto Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now there is a Twofold APPLICATION to be made of this Obſervation. We will diſcourſe on this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, by Applying it unto two ſorts of perſons.</p>
               <p n="1">I. It is the Intereſt of all TEACHERS to <hi>Begin Betimes,</hi> in Teaching of <hi>Children,</hi> the <hi>Early Knowledge</hi> of the HOLY SCRIPTURES, that ſo they may be WISE UNTO SAL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VATION.

               </p>
               <p>We will, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Enquire, and Declare, WHEN ſhould we <hi>Begin</hi> to <hi>Teach our Children,</hi> the <hi>Knowledge of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BETIMES! BETIMES! Let the Children have the <hi>Early Knowledge</hi> of the <hi>Holy Scriptures.</hi> That Princely Preacher, the Prince of <hi>Anbalt,</hi> would ſay; <hi>The Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, what are they but the ſwadling Clothes of the Holy Child Jeſus?</hi> HE is to be found in every Chapter. I will then ſay, Let us Teach our Children the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> as ſoon as we can after they come out of their <hi>Swadling Cloaths.</hi> This is the Direction of the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> Deut. 6.7. <hi>Thou ſhall

teach them diligently unto thy Children.</hi> And Eph. 6.4. <hi>Your Children, Bring them up in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord.</hi> But the HOLY SCRIPTURES have not Expreſly ſaid, <hi>How Early,</hi> we ſhall <hi>Begin to Teach</hi> our Children, the KNOWLEDGE of them. However, we may eaſily De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine it.</p>
               <p>Firſt; <hi>How Early</hi> do the Children begin to be <hi>capable</hi> of <hi>Knowing</hi> &amp; <hi>Minding</hi> what is in the HOLY SCRIPTURES? Moſt certainly we ſhould <hi>Begin as ſoon as we can. As ſoon</hi> as the Children can <hi>know, ſo ſoon</hi> ſhould we <hi>Teach</hi> them, what they ſhould <hi>know. So much</hi> there is to be Learnt, it is pity any <hi>Time</hi> ſhould be Loſt.

               </p>
               <p>Again; <hi>How Early</hi> do the Children begin to Know <hi>Other Matters?</hi> Why ſhould we not begin to Teach them ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> that may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>Once more; <hi>How Early</hi> do the Children Begin to <hi>Know,</hi> and to <hi>Do,</hi> what may be <hi>Hurtful</hi> to them? 'Tis very <hi>Early,</hi> that they Learn the Things <hi>Condemned</hi> in the HOLY SCRIPTURES. Why ſhould they not as EARLY Learn the HOLY SCRIPTURES, which do condemn thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious and provoking Evils? Why ſhould they not <hi>know</hi> the <hi>Precepts</hi> of God, as EARLY as they know how to <hi>Break</hi> the Precepts? Why ſhould they not be Taught, that they muſt Fear God, and Love Chriſt, and Hate Sin, as EARLY as they can Learn to <hi>Sin?</hi> Eſpecially ſince this would be the way to <hi>preſerve</hi> them from <hi>Sin.</hi> A Child no ſooner begins to do any thing <hi>Rational,</hi> but <hi>Satan</hi> begins to ſhow it, how to do ſomething that is <hi>Criminal.</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks;

I ſee the Image of it; Rev. 12.4. <hi>The Dragon ſtood to devour the Child as ſoon as it was born,</hi> Then ſay I; It becomes us to be <hi>Aforehand</hi> with the <hi>Dragon,</hi> if it be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: To ſtand Ready with the <hi>Knowledge of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> to reſcue the <hi>Children</hi> from the Venomous Deſigns of the <hi>Dragon</hi> upon them.</p>
               <p>There is a plauſible Objection, againſt this <hi>Early Eſſay,</hi> to give our <hi>Children</hi> the <hi>Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Will not this be to make the Children, <hi>Take the Name of the Lord in vain?</hi> Would it not be more <hi>Diſcretion,</hi> to ſtay till the <hi>Children</hi> are themſelves come to ſome <hi>Years of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is Eaſily Anſwered.

               </p>
               <p>We will, <hi>Secondly,</hi> Enquire, and Declare, WHAT is that <hi>Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures,</hi> which we are to <hi>Teach our Children?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Truly, AS MUCH as ever WE CAN help them to; <hi>All</hi> the <hi>Knowledge,</hi> that they can Take in, ſtill as we find them <hi>Able</hi> to Take it in. More particularly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               </p>
