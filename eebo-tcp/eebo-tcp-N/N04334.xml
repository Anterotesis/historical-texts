            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>I. TIM. iv. 16.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <hi>Take heed unto thy ſelf, and unto thy Doctrine; and continue in them: For in doing this, thou ſhalt ſave both thy ſelf, and them that hear thee.</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THEY are the Words of PAUL to TIMOTHY, <hi>his own Son in the Faith:</hi> And they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to him, not in his <hi>private</hi> Capacity as a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> but an <hi>Officer</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of GOD; one whom JESUS CHRIST the LORD <hi>had counted faithful, putting him into the Miniſtry.</hi> And they were, no doubt, intended for the Inſtruction and Admonition of all others, in all after Ages, to whoſe <hi>Truſt, the glorious Goſpel of the bleſſed GOD, ſhould be committed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And two Things are obſervable in them.</p>
            <p>I. A <hi>ſummary Repreſentation of the Duty of Miniſters. Take heed unto thy ſelf, and unto thy Doctrine; continue in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. A <hi>ſpecial Motive</hi> inforcing the Duty. <hi>For in doing this, thou ſhalt ſave both thy ſelf, and them that hear thee.</hi>

Accordingly, theſe are the <hi>general Heads</hi> we ſhall diſtinctly ſpeak to, and then finiſh with an <hi>Application</hi> proper to the Buſineſs of the Day.</p>
            <p>I. The firſt Thing to employ our Thoughts from the Text is, the <hi>Deſcription</hi> it gives of the <hi>Duty</hi> of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters;</hi> ſummarily comprehending the three following Particulars. (1.) Their <hi>taking heed to themſelves.</hi> (2.) To their <hi>Doctrine.</hi> (3.) Their <hi>continuing in theſe Things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>firſt</hi> Article in the <hi>Duty</hi> of <hi>Miniſters</hi> is, their <hi>taking heed to themſelves,</hi> i. e. their <hi>Minds,</hi> that they be furniſh'd, both with <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Gifts;</hi> and their <hi>Behaviour,</hi> that it be befitting thoſe, who are cloathed with the <hi>ſacred Office.</hi> Here it may be diſtinctly ſaid,</p>
            <p n="1">1. If <hi>Miniſters</hi> would <hi>take heed to themſelves,</hi> they muſt look to their <hi>Minds,</hi> that they be furniſh'd both with <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Gifts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They muſt expreſs a ſutable Care, that their <hi>Minds</hi> be furniſh'd with <hi>Grace.</hi> Or, in other Words, they muſt ſee to it that they be <hi>inwardly</hi> Men of <hi>Religion; Partakers of the Divine Nature;</hi> Subjects of <hi>Faith</hi> in JESUS CHRIST, that Faith which ſhall <hi>purify their Hearts, purge their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences from dead Works,</hi> &amp; diſpoſe them to an <hi>Acquieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence</hi> in the <hi>Goſpel</hi> Method of Salvation: Nor can they otherwiſe be in Favour with GOD here, or have Admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into his Kingdom hereafter. For the Way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is <hi>one.</hi> 'Tis the ſame both for Miniſters and People. 'Tis not meerly our being Preachers to others, that will avail to our Salvation. We muſt be <hi>Men in CHRIST,</hi> juſtified in his Righteouſneſs, and ſanctified by his SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT; or nothing will prevent our being doom'd, at the great and laſt Day, to a Departure from CHRIST among the Workers of Iniquity. Our firſt and chief Care there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould be, to experience in our own Hearts the Truths we preach to others; to be <hi>ourſelves</hi> the <hi>regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:005358_0005_101822354F3762C0"/>
Men, the <hi>new Creatures,</hi> the <hi>ſound Believers,</hi> we urge others to be: Nor would any Thing more happily tend to render our Miniſtry ſerviceable to the great and good Ends of our being intruſted with it.</p>
            <p>Though I would not be underſtood by this to ſuggeſt, as if Miniſters <hi>muſt</hi> be endowed with <hi>ſaving Grace,</hi> or no good Effect would follow upon their Adminiſtrations in CHRIST'S Name. I know, the <hi>Inſtrumentality</hi> of <hi>uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted</hi> Miniſters, in the Buſineſs of <hi>Regeneration,</hi> has, in theſe Days, been compared to <hi>that</hi> of a <hi>naturally dead Man in begetting Children.</hi> But this Way of repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Matter is evidently founded on groſs Ignorance of the unavoidable State of the <hi>viſible Kingdom of GOD.</hi> There is no ſuch Thing as <hi>certainly</hi> ſecuring the Church of CHRIST from the Miniſtrations of Men, not knowing the Grace of GOD in Truth. Neither <hi>People</hi> who call Men to the Work of the Miniſtry, nor <hi>Miniſters</hi> who ſeparate them to it, can look into their Hearts: Nor can they, either of them, make a Judgment of their <hi>State</hi> by any Thing but what is <hi>outward</hi> and <hi>viſible.</hi> And notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the moſt ſpecious <hi>outward</hi> Appearance, whether in Word or Deed, their Hearts may be leaven'd with <hi>Hypocriſy:</hi> Nor can it be <hi>known</hi> of any Miniſter, on the Earth, that he is the Man <hi>inwardly,</hi> he profeſſes to be <hi>outwardly.</hi> I ſpeak not this to inſinuate a Suſpicion of Miniſters, as tho' they were <hi>Hypocrites.</hi> GOD forbid I ſhould be an Encourager of ſuch <hi>Uncharitableneſs,</hi> or, in this Way, lead any into an ill Opinion of them, to the Hurt of their Reputation and Uſefulneſs! But what I aim at is to ſhow, that there is no knowing the <hi>inward real</hi> State of <hi>Miniſters</hi> any more than People; and that, after the cloſeſt Adherence to <hi>Scripture-rule</hi> in judging of them, we may be deceived, taking them for <hi>converted</hi> when they are not. And can it be ſuppoſed, that <hi>ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying Grace</hi> ſhould be <hi>neceſſary</hi> to a <hi>regular</hi> or <hi>valid</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of Goſpel-Ordinances, when 'tis the <hi>ſole Prerogative</hi> of the great GOD, to <hi>know</hi> the Perſons that
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:005358_0006_10182237251ABFB0"/>
are endowed with it, and the <hi>appropriate</hi> Work of the SON of GOD, at the final Judgment, to declare who they are? Is it poſſible <hi>that</hi> ſhould be <hi>eſſential</hi> to the <hi>Character</hi> or <hi>Succeſs</hi> of Miniſters, in regard of which there is no Church on Earth but may be impoſed on? And if Goſpel-Ordinances will be <hi>effectual</hi> to Salvation, <hi>only</hi> as adminiſtred by <hi>converted</hi> Miniſters, whoſe Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of them muſt be attended on? And the Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of this Queſtion is the more neceſſary, becauſe, for all any Thing that we know, or indeed can know, unleſs by <hi>immediate Revelation from GOD,</hi> the Miniſters we moſt admire, and have the higheſt Opinion of, as eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>ſanctified</hi> Men, may be no other than <hi>whited Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres, beautiful without; but within, full of dead Men's Bones, and all Rottenneſs and Uncleanneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This confining the <hi>Succeſs</hi> of Goſpel-Ordinances to the <hi>inward unknown Sanctity</hi> of the Adminiſtrators is therefore unreaſonable and antichriſtian; yea, purſued in its juſt Conſequences, it will totally deſtroy the Uſe, both of <hi>Ordinances</hi> and <hi>Miniſters</hi> to diſpenſe them. And however ſome may be very fond of a Notion car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying in it ſo much ſeeming Piety, and zealous in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating it to the Diſturbance of the Churches, and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting Diviſions in them, they herein depart, both from the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and the <hi>Principles</hi> of the famous <hi>Weſtminſter Aſſembly of Divines,</hi> as well as the <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>Forefathers</hi> of this Country, one expreſs Article in whoſe Confeſſion, conſented to by their <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers,</hi> convened at <hi>Boſton,</hi> May 12. 1660, is in theſe Words, <q>The grace which is exhibited in or by the Sacraments, rightly uſed, is not conferred by any Power in them: Neither doth the <hi>efficacy</hi> of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament depend upon the <hi>Piety,</hi> or <hi>Intention</hi> of him that doth adminiſter it: but upon the <hi>Work of the</hi> SPIRIT, and the <hi>Word of Inſtitution,</hi> which contains, together with a Precept authoriſing the Uſe thereof, a <hi>Promiſe</hi> of <hi>Benefit</hi> to <hi>worthy</hi> Receivers.</q> But to go on,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:005358_0007_1018223C58624F40"/>
               <hi>Miniſters</hi> ſhould not only take Care that their Minds be furniſh'd with Grace, but with <hi>Gifts</hi> alſo. It may reaſonably be ſuppos'd, that their <hi>natural Gifts,</hi> their <hi>mental</hi> Capacities, are above the common level: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, they certainly judged ill in deſiring the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of <hi>Overſeers</hi> in the Church of GOD; and it was ill-judged in <hi>People</hi> to call them to the Work of the Miniſtry, and ſtill more ſo in the Paſtors of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches who ſeparated them to it. But it is not enough that they are endow'd with good <hi>natural</hi> Powers. Theſe muſt be well cultivated and enriched by <hi>Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Study.</hi> In this Way, under the Influence of the bleſſed SPIRIT, they ſhould take Pains, that they may acquire all <hi>neceſſary Gifts</hi> for the Uſe of Edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Gifts for <hi>praying,</hi> and <hi>preaching,</hi> and adminiſtring the <hi>Sacraments</hi> and <hi>Cenſures</hi> of the Kingdom of CHRIST: Nor ſhould they content themſelves meerly with an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to do theſe Duties of their Office; but endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour after a Capacity and Readineſs to perform them in an agreeable Manner, ſo as to engage the Attention, and command the Eſteem and Veneration of their Hearers. Eſpecially ſhould Miniſters take Care, that their <hi>preaching</hi> be ſuch as may diſcover them to be Men of Knowledge and Underſtanding, and not Babes in Divine Things. It ſhould appear from their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, that they are able to inſtruct the Ignorant, to reſolve the Doubting, to convince the Gain-ſayers, to awaken the Secure, to comfort the Broken-hearted; and, in a Word, that they have the Skill to adapt themſelves to the Caſes of all Sorts of Perſons, and to the various Occurrences, in divine Providence, which may be capable of being improved to the ſpiritual Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of their People.</p>
            <p>Some, perhaps, may expect to be furniſhed with theſe Qualifications for the Work of the Miniſtry, in an <hi>extraordinary</hi> Way, without the diligent Uſe of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Means.</hi> But they herein miſerably delude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.

PAUL, in my Context, <hi>not to neglect the Gift that was in him;</hi> but to make <hi>his profiting appear unto all, by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Attendance to Reading and Meditation.</hi> And it is in this Way, together with the Uſe of <hi>Prayer,</hi> humbly depending on the Bleſſing of Heaven, and in this Way <hi>only,</hi> that we may warrantably hope to acquire thoſe miniſterial Accompliſhments, which will be an Honor to our Profeſſion, and render us eminently uſeful in the Places Divine Providence has fixed us. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Miniſters,</hi> in taking heed to <hi>themſelves,</hi> ſhould look to their <hi>Behaviour</hi> that it be befitting thoſe who are intruſted with the Care of Souls. In Order whereto,</p>
            <p>To be ſure, they muſt not be Men of <hi>bad Lives.</hi> A <hi>vicious</hi> Miniſter is one of the moſt miſbecoming Creatures in all the World. A Teacher of others in all Godlineſs and Righteouſneſs, and yet prophane, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, intemperate, unjuſt, uncharitable; what a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach is he to himſelf, and Scandal to the Profeſſion? The Lives of ſuch Miniſters are a practical Contempt of Religion, whatever they may ſay in its Favour while they are <hi>preaching.</hi> The Ways of Piety, through their Means, are evil-ſpoken of, and the <hi>Son of GOD</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf reproached and blaſphemed. When others ſee the Preachers of Salvation living in thoſe Practices that are unſeemly in the Sight of GOD and Man, they are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to eſteem CHRIST <hi>a Miniſter of Sin,</hi> and to reflect upon <hi>his Religion</hi> as allowing, or, at leaſt, not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently diſcountenancing Vice and Wickedneſs: Nor does any Thing more dreadfully prejudice Men againſt a religious Profeſſion, and harden them in their Sins.</p>
            <p>But beſides not being vicious, <hi>Miniſters</hi> ſhould be of <hi>a good Converſation in</hi> CHRIST. It is not enough that they keep themſelves innocent from great Tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that they are blameleſs, and without Rebuke, in the midſt of a crooked and perverſe Generation; but they
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005358_0009_10182241B22FD6E0"/>
muſt expreſs a becoming Care to <hi>ſhew themſelves Patterns of good Works; Examples</hi> to all they live among, <hi>in Word, in Converſation, in Faith, in Purity, in Charity.</hi> Such ſhould be their Manner of Life as to be able to appeal to the People of their reſpective Charges, in the Language of the <hi>Apoſtles, Ye are Witneſſes, and GOD alſo, how holily, and juſtly, and unblameably, we behaved ourſelves among them that believe.</hi> This would exhibit a lovely Idea of Religion, and recommend it to the Choice and Eſteem of the World, more than the beſt ſtudied Sermons, while they ſaw we paid little Regard to them ourſelves.</p>
            <p>But there are ſome <hi>ſpecial</hi> Inſtances of <hi>Behaviour,</hi> peculiarly befitting Miniſters, and wherein they muſt be <hi>exemplary,</hi> if they would take due heed to <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi> Thus,</p>
            <p>They ſhould behave with <hi>Humility;</hi> ſetting before their View, the Example of the meek and lowly JESUS, their Maſter and Lord; who condeſcended to waſh e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven his Diſciples Feet. They ſhould not, becauſe they have the Advantage of ſome others in Point of <hi>Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Gifts,</hi> and <hi>Station</hi> in the Church of GOD, grow big in their own Imagination, and treat thoſe below them with Neglect and Contempt. Nothing appears more unſeemly in thoſe whoſe Buſineſs it is to <hi>preach up Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,</hi> than the Diſcovery of a proud and haughty Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, a Temper to <hi>lord it over GOD's Heritage,</hi> and to carry it with Loftineſs, as though they might not be ſpoken to. But of all Pride in Miniſters, none is ſo odious as that which is <hi>ſpiritual.</hi> They never appear more diſagreeable, than while they are boaſting of their own ſuperior Sanctity, truſting in themſelves that they are righteous, and deſpiſing others; eſpecially is this Vanity deteſtable, when it ſhows itſelf in Contempt of their <hi>Brethren</hi> in the <hi>Miniſtry;</hi> when they are urged on by it to invade their Province, looking upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as <hi>extraordinary</hi> Men, <hi>ſpecial</hi> inſtruments in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:005358_0010_10182244852E5310"/>
of Sinners<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> while thoſe, into whoſe Labours they enter, are eſteemed and treated by them (tho' perhaps much more valuable than themſelves in the Opinion of all ſober Judges) as poor carnal worthleſs Creatures, not fit to preach the Goſpel. How much better would it ſute the Character of thoſe who are the Miniſters of the humble JESUS, if, with the great <hi>Apoſtle</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> they appeared to have an Opinion of themſelves as <hi>leſs than the leaſt of all Saints, and not meet to be called Miniſters?</hi> If they preferred others in Love, eſteemed them better than themſelves, and treated them with a decent Reſpect? And they would ſhine ſtill brighter, if, at all Times, they appear'd with an Air of Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Condeſcenſion, ſhewing <hi>Humility</hi> to <hi>all,</hi> in their Speech, in their Carriage, in all the Exerciſes of their Office. This modeſt humble Deportment is <hi>graceful</hi> in <hi>any,</hi> but peculiarly recommending in Men of <hi>our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</hi> Scarce any Thing will raiſe us higher in the good Opinion of People; whereas, if we are lofty and proud, its much if we are reverenced by any but our ſelves.</p>
            <p>Miniſters ſhould behave alſo with <hi>Charity;</hi> diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Readineſs to all the Offices of Chriſtian Love and Kindneſs, both to Men's Souls and Bodies, their Character and Uſefulneſs in the World: Nor ſhould they confine theſe Exerciſes of their Good-will to their Friends and Acquaintance, thoſe who may think well of them and admire them. This would be to do no more than <hi>Publicans</hi> and <hi>Sinners.</hi> For they <hi>love thoſe that love them, ſalute their Brethren,</hi> and treat their Friends with ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Marks of Civility and Courteſie. And ſhall <hi>Chriſtian Miniſters</hi> carry the Expreſſions of their Charity no higher than this comes to? They ought to ſhew their Benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to Enemies, yea, the greateſt Enemies they have in the World; thoſe who moſt injure and abuſe them. It ſhould be viſible to all they Converſe with, that they can put up Affronts, bear Inſults, forgive ill Treatment, yea, that they can <hi>do good to them that hate them,</hi> that
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005358_0011_1018224616BB2EF0"/>
they can <hi>bleſs them that curſe them,</hi> and <hi>pray for them that deſpitefully uſe and perſecute them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if they ſhould exerciſe Charity in ſuch high In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, much more ſhould they behave with Kindneſs to thoſe, who are no otherwiſe Enemies to them, than as they cannot think and ſpeak juſt as they would have them. They ſhould not <hi>judge</hi> ſuch; they ſhould not <hi>ſet at nought</hi> ſuch; for one is <hi>our Maſter in Heaven,</hi> and we <hi>muſt all appear before the Judgment-ſeat of</hi> CHRIST. They ſhould not treat ſuch with <hi>Bitterneſs,</hi> and <hi>Wrath,</hi> and <hi>Anger,</hi> and <hi>Clamour,</hi> and <hi>Evil-ſpeaking.</hi> This is not the <hi>Charity,</hi> any more than the Wiſdom, <hi>that is from above.</hi> The Charity of this Kind is <hi>peaceable, gentle, eaſy to be intreated, full of Mercy, and good Fruits, and without Partiality.</hi> It looks ill, eſpecially in <hi>Miniſters,</hi> to call bad Names, to ſit in Judgment upon their Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Chriſtians, and <hi>Fellow-Labourers</hi> in the Work of the Lord, to determine their State, and damn their Souls. It would be much more becoming, ſhould they be <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers of the Truth, and taken in the Snare of the Devil, to inſtruct them in Meekneſs.</hi> This might, through the Bleſſing of GOD, bring them <hi>to Repentance, to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging of the Truth:</hi> But to <hi>rail</hi> at them will have no Tendency to enlighten their Minds, or alter their Judgments; though it may move their Reſentments, and fill them with Indignation.</p>
            <p>In like Manner, Miniſters ſhould behave with <hi>Steadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> making it apparent, that they are of <hi>fixt</hi> Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and a <hi>uniform</hi> Conduct. They ſhould not be <hi>like Children, toſſed to and fro, and carried about with every Wind of Doctrine:</hi> Neither ſhould they be like thoſe <hi>fluctuating, volatile, uncertain</hi> Men, who are <hi>eaſily turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed aſide from the Truth, by the cunning Craftineſs of thoſe who lie in wait to deceive.</hi> To be ſure, they ſhould not vary and change, be of this Party or that, appear in this Shape or the other, as may beſt ſute the ſinful Deſign of <hi>pleaſing Man:</hi> But they ſhould be Men of Steadineſs,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005358_0012_10182248AEDFD508"/>
conſiſtent with themſelves, altering neither their <hi>Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> nor <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> nor <hi>Conduct,</hi> that they may fall in-with the Example of the <hi>Populace,</hi> the <hi>Humour</hi> of ſome <hi>particular Perſons,</hi> or the <hi>Revolution of Affairs,</hi> whether in <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State.</hi> Miniſters, above all Men, ſhould be <hi>ſtedfaſt and immoveable.</hi> I do not mean, that they ſhould be <hi>unreaſonably</hi> ſo. There is a <hi>Tenaciouſneſs,</hi> both of <hi>Opinion</hi> and <hi>Practice,</hi> ariſing from <hi>Pride, Ignorance, Prejudice, Heat</hi> and <hi>Strength of Imagination:</hi> And the Men are to be pitied, rather than commended, who are thus <hi>ſtiff:</hi> They are rather <hi>blindly obſtinate,</hi> than <hi>ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ſtedfaſt.</hi> The <hi>Stedfaſtneſs</hi> which would be a Glory to Miniſters, is ſuch an <hi>habitual Fixedneſs</hi> of Sentiment and <hi>Uniformity</hi> of Practice, as is the Reſult of Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and impartial, deliberate, thorow Inquiry into the Mind of GOD, made known in the Bible. And having, in this Way, ſettled their Principles, and ſatisfied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves how they ought to act, they ſhould not waver in their Minds, and be unſtable in their Ways. That was the Advice PAUL gave TIMOTHY, in his 2d Epiſt. to him, Chap. 1. v. 13. <hi>Hold faſt the Form of ſound Words, which thou haſt heard of me, in Faith and Love which is in</hi> CHRIST JESUS. And the more <hi>ſpecial Reaſon</hi> of this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is added in the 15 v. <hi>This thou knoweſt, that all they which are in Aſia be turned away from me.</hi> And the ſame Advice is ſeaſonable at this Day, and too much ſo, for the like Reaſon. To be ſure, there is Danger, leſt <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters</hi> ſhould be <hi>turned away from the Apoſtles:</hi> And they ſhould take heed to themſelves, that they <hi>fall not from their Stedfaſtneſs,</hi> being <hi>led away with the Error of the Wicked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, Miniſters ſhould behave with <hi>Courage</hi> and <hi>Reſolution;</hi> not being aſham'd, or afraid, to appear for GOD, and in Defence of his <hi>Truths</hi> and <hi>Ways.</hi> It would be mean in thoſe who are commiſſion'd Servants of JESUS CHRIST, to behold the Riſe of Error, in Oppoſition to the Faith revealed by him; to behold the Growth of <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Wickedneſs,</hi> in Contradiction to the Law of GOD
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005358_0013_1018224ADD34F1A8"/>
made known in his Goſpel; to behold the general Spread of <hi>Contention</hi> and <hi>Schiſm,</hi> in Violation of the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> he has appointed: I ſay, it would be daſtardly in Miniſters to ſee theſe Things, and ſtand by, and keep Silence. They are <hi>ſet for the Defence of the Goſpel;</hi> 'tis one ſpecial Part of the Work they are called to, <hi>by ſound Doctrine, to exhort and convince Gain ſayers.</hi> And <hi>now</hi> is the Time when they ſhould ſtand up for the <hi>good old Way,</hi> and bear a faithful Teſtimony againſt every Thing that may caſt a Blemiſh on <hi>true primitive Chriſtianity.</hi> And if they <hi>now</hi> hold their Peace, they are too much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Influence of that <hi>Fear of Man, which bringeth a Snare;</hi> they are guilty of <hi>Cowardice</hi> which they can't give a good Account of, either to GOD, or their own <hi>Conſciences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In fine, Miniſters ſhould behave with <hi>Activity</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence. Idleneſs</hi> in a <hi>Miniſter</hi> is one of the worſt Things that can be ſaid of him, and ſhould be moſt diſtant from his Character. <hi>Be an Example,</hi> ſays the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to TI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MOTHY, <hi>in Spirit,</hi> i. e. as ſome gloſs upon it, "in a ſprightly Zeal and Activity for the Glory of GOD, and the Good of Souls." We have a great deal of Work to do, as we are called to watch for the Souls of others, as well as our own; a great deal to do, not only in our <hi>Cloſets</hi> and <hi>Studies,</hi> but in our <hi>private Applications,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to the <hi>Sick,</hi> thoſe that are <hi>gone aſtray,</hi> and thoſe who may be under <hi>ſpiritual Doubts</hi> and <hi>Troubles;</hi> and in our <hi>public</hi> Performances. And theſe Duties can never be done as they ought to be, without a good Meaſure of Diligence and Induſtry. To be ſure, we cannot attend the more <hi>private</hi> Duties of our Office with Fidelity, and do our Duty in the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> in a becoming Manner, unleſs we are active, and fill up our Time with Pains and Labour. 'Tis true, we may loiter away the Week in Indolence, or in rambling about to intermeddle in other Men's Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and entertain our People on the Sabbath with ſome <hi>haſty,</hi> or <hi>unmeditated</hi> Diſcourſe: But ſuch preaching has very little Worth. It may indeed paſs well enough with
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005358_0014_1018224CA9E25210"/>
the Weak and Ignorant; but 'tis perfectly taſteleſs to the Wiſe and Judicious, who, on this Account, will juſtly conceive a low Opinion of us. How much more would it redound to our Honour, if we ſo performed the Duties of our Station, as that it ſhould be apparent to all, that our Heart was in our Buſineſs, that it ſwallowed up our whole Time, and employed all our Tho'ts and Powers? But I muſt paſs on to the</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Second</hi> Branch of the Duty of Miniſters, <abbr>viz.</abbr> their <hi>taking heed to their Doctrine.</hi> And they muſt take heed to it, that it be <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> in Oppoſition to that which is the Reſult of <hi>meer Reaſon;</hi> that it be <hi>ſound,</hi> in Oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to that which is <hi>corrupt;</hi> that it be <hi>important,</hi> in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to that which is <hi>trifling;</hi> and, in fine, that it be <hi>real,</hi> in Oppoſition to that which is <hi>imaginary.</hi> We ſhall be diſtinct and particular here. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Miniſters ſhould take heed to their <hi>Doctrine,</hi> that it be <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and not <hi>meerly rational.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would not, by this, be underſtood to find Fault with a <hi>rational</hi> Way of preaching. This was <hi>Paul'</hi>s <hi>Manner,</hi> that eminent Pattern of good preaching. Hence that Remark in his Story, Acts 17. 2. <hi>And</hi> Paul, <hi>as</hi> HIS MAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NER WAS, <hi>went in unto them, and three Sabbath-Days</hi> REASONED <hi>with them out of the Scriptures.</hi> And the like obſervable Remark we have, in the next Chapter v. 4. <hi>And he</hi> REASONED <hi>in the Synagogue every Sabbath, and perſuaded the Jews, and the Greeks.</hi> And 'tis a Way of preaching that ought not to be ſpoken againſt. 'Tis the Way in which Men, who are <hi>reaſonable</hi> Creatures, ought to be addreſt to: Nor are they treated as Men, if all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Care is not taken to inform their Judgments, and fill their Minds with the Knowledge of GOD's Will in all, ſpiritual Wiſdom and Underſtanding.</p>
            <p>Neither would I be underſtood to ſuggeſt, as if <hi>Reaſon</hi> had nothing to do in Matters of <hi>Revelation.</hi> So far is
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:005358_0015_10182253B66A5BE0"/>
this from the Truth, that without <hi>Reaſon</hi> we could never know the <hi>Meaning</hi> of a Revelation from GOD, or prove it to be one. And 'tis the peculiar Glory of the great and main Points of <hi>revealed</hi> Religion, that they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly conſiſtent with <hi>Reaſon,</hi> tho' they could not have been inveſtigated by it: Nor does a Preacher do more Honor to <hi>Revelation,</hi> than while he diſcourſes upon the ſeveral Articles of it in a Way of <hi>Reaſoning</hi> and <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> repreſenting them worthy of GOD, and fit to be embraced by Men, though they ſhould, ſome of them, be beyond human Comprehenſion. And indeed <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> are no ſuch Enemies as ſome may be ready to imagine. There is no Doctrine of <hi>Faith,</hi> but it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly accords with the Principles of <hi>true Reaſon:</hi> Nor otherwiſe might it be received as an Article of <hi>Faith.</hi> We ſhould never therefore oppoſe <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Reaſon;</hi> but rather conſider them as Helps and Supports to each other; for ſo they really are: Nor can there be <hi>Faith</hi> without <hi>Reaſon.</hi> To be ſure, it would groſly reflect upon <hi>Faith,</hi> if in Order to our being <hi>Believers,</hi> we muſt renounce our <hi>Reaſon;</hi> for this would be to put off our Character as <hi>Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But though <hi>Reaſon</hi> may, and ought to be employed by <hi>Miniſters</hi> in <hi>preaching,</hi> yet the <hi>Doctrine</hi> they preach ſhould not be the Reſult of <hi>meer human Reaſon.</hi> It would be highly incongruous, and juſtly offenſive, in a Miniſter of the Goſpel, to diſcourſe to his Hearers, as though he had no Knowledge of, or Regard to, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation GOD has made of himſelf by his SON JESUS CHRIST. He ſhould ever appear to be a <hi>Miniſter</hi> of CHRIST by the <hi>Doctrine</hi> he preaches. This ſhould be truly <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> as being fetch'd from the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> His preaching ſhould not be in <hi>Words of Man's Wiſdom,</hi> but the <hi>Truth as it is in</hi> JESUS. He may properly enough, upon ſome Occaſions, ſpeak of thoſe Things, which might have been known, by the due Exerciſe of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> without <hi>Revelation;</hi> but he ſhould not confine himſelf, in treating even upon theſe Things, to <hi>meer Reaſon;</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:005358_0016_10182256C6B573F8"/>
but ſhould make Uſe of the Light that is reflected on them from the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and take Care to conſider them in the Reference they bear to CHRIST. Nor ſhould he be aſhamed to inſiſt much in his Preaching, upon the <hi>Myſteries</hi> which were <hi>hid from Ages and Generations,</hi> but have been <hi>made manifeſt in theſe laſt Days,</hi> by the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the SON of GOD in our Nature. The Method of Salvation by the Redeemer JESUS CHRIST, the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Counſels of GOD unfolded to a periſhing World by him, ſhould be the <hi>main Scope</hi> of his Sermons. With PHILIP, he ſhould <hi>preach the Things concerning the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of GOD, and the Name of</hi> JESUS CHHIST: Yea, with the Apoſtle PAUL, he ſhould <hi>determine not to know any Thing</hi> among his People, <hi>ſave</hi> JESUS CHRIST, <hi>and him crucified.</hi> And the more of CHRIST, not his <hi>meer Name,</hi> but the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Genius</hi> of <hi>his Religion,</hi> he diſcovers in his Preaching, the more worthy will he be of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of an able Miniſter of the New-Teſtament.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Miniſters ſhould take heed to their <hi>Doctrine,</hi> that it be <hi>ſound,</hi> in Oppoſition to that which is <hi>falſe</hi> and <hi>erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous.</hi> It ſhould be the <hi>pure, uncorrupted Word</hi> of GOD. This, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> had principally in the Eye; and it ſeems, indeed, to have been a Matter much lying on his Heart. Hence in mentioning the Qualifications proper for Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, that is one, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>Holding faſt the faithful Word, as he hath been taught, that he may be able, by</hi> SOUND DOCTRINE, <hi>both to exhort, and convince the Gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers.</hi> And in his Inſtructions to TITUS, as a Goſpel-Miniſter, he is particular in exhorting him <hi>to ſpeak the Things which become</hi> SOUND DOCTRINE;—<hi>ſhewing Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptneſs, ſound Speech that cannot be condemned,</hi> Chap. 2. v. 1. 7. 8. Miniſters then ſhould not be as thoſe <hi>who corrupt the Word of GOD;</hi> they ſhould not, as was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of the <hi>Prophets</hi> in ancient Days, <hi>propheſy Lies in GOD's Name;</hi> they ſhould not, as was the Practice of ſome in the <hi>Apoſtle'</hi>s Days, <hi>beguile</hi> their People <hi>with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticing Words,</hi> turning them away from the <hi>Simplicity of the Goſpel:</hi> But that ſhould be their Character, <hi>Teachers</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:005358_0017_1018225A9D575E28"/>
of their People <hi>in Verity; Nouriſhers</hi> of them <hi>in Faith and good Doctrine.</hi> They ſhould deliver nothing but the Truth, and ſhould do it, as much as may be, without the Mixture of any Thing <hi>erroneous:</hi> And they ſhould be particularly cautious upon this Head, at a Time, when People <hi>will not endure ſound Doctrine, but, after their own Luſts, heap to themſelves Teachers, having itch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ears.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Would the Time permit, I might here properly take Occaſion to enumerate ſome of thoſe <hi>Errors,</hi> which, if Miniſters ſhould countenance in their Preaching, they would not <hi>take heed to their Doctrine,</hi> that it be <hi>ſound.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe <hi>Errors</hi> is, that which makes <hi>Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> eſſential to a Man's being a true Believer in CHRIST. The <hi>Bible</hi> knows of no ſuch Doctrine as this. It tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, it is true, that Aſſurance is attainable; that it is the Duty of Chriſtians to give Diligence to make their Calling and Election ſure; and that it is a bad Sign when Men are eaſy and contented, while uncertain whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are intereſted in the ſaving Mercy of GOD, through the LORD JESUS CHRIST. But it no where ſays, that a Man cannot be a <hi>real</hi> Chriſtian, if under Doubts and Difficulties reſpecting his <hi>ſpiritual</hi> State: So far from it, that it expreſly declares a Man may truly <hi>fear and obey GOD,</hi> and yet <hi>walk in Darkneſs;</hi> Yea, in Darkneſs to ſo great a Degree as to <hi>ſee no Light;</hi> Iſai. 50. 10. It is therefore a corrupting the Truth to tell People, that <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Aſſurance</hi> are <hi>inſeparably connected,</hi> and that there cannot be the former without the latter. And thoſe, who deliver ſuch Doctrine as this, juſtly <hi>offend the Generation of GOD's Children,</hi> who, in all Ages, have experienced the Reverſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That</hi> alſo is an <hi>Error</hi> which makes the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of the <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Manner</hi> of Converſion neceſſary to the Thing it ſelf. This is a Doctrine the <hi>Scripture</hi> is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Stranger to: Nor will it accord with the Experience
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:005358_0018_1018225D18A36F20"/>
of a great many as good Chriſtians as any we know of in the World. Converſion, it is true, is ſometimes ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in a Manner ſo obſervable, that the <hi>Time.</hi> and <hi>Circumſtances,</hi> may be particularly pointed out: But 'tis not always thus, nor, it may be, moſt frequently. There is a vaſt Variety in the Dealing of GOD, with different Perſons, in bringing them into a State of Grace, both as to <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Manner,</hi> as well as <hi>Degree,</hi> yea, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry other <hi>Circumſtance</hi> relative thereto. So that if ſome can tell <hi>when</hi> and <hi>how</hi> they were converted, it is no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument others muſt be able to do the like, tho' equally in a good State. A <hi>real, thorow</hi> Converſion from Sin to GOD in CHRIST, is <hi>neceſſary;</hi> and to affirm it to be ſo is <hi>ſound</hi> Doctrine: but to ſay that we can't be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, unleſs we know the <hi>preciſe Time</hi> when this Change was wrought, is <hi>corrupt</hi> and <hi>falſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In like Manner, 'tis groſly <hi>erroneous</hi> to pretend, as if <hi>unregenerate</hi> Men ought not to <hi>pray;</hi> and there needs no other Proof of it than only this, that GOD has plainly commanded them to <hi>pray.</hi> Thoſe Perſons are certainly <hi>unregenerate,</hi> who want a <hi>new Heart to be given to them,</hi> and a <hi>new ſpirit to be put within them;</hi> and yet, that is the Language of GOD to Perſons of <hi>this Character,</hi> and in Order to their Obtainment of a <hi>new Heart,</hi> and a <hi>new Spirit,</hi> Ezek. 36. 37. <hi>I will for this be enquired of by the Houſe of Iſrael, to do it for them.</hi> And what if <hi>unconverted</hi> Men cannot pray in the ſame <hi>gracious</hi> Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with thoſe, who have been <hi>transformed by the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the</hi> HOLY GHOST? Did not GOD know this before the Appointment of Prayer: And han't he, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, revealed it as his <hi>Mind</hi> that <hi>they</hi> ſhould pray? Yea, that they ſhould attend this Duty, as an <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of his, in the Uſe of which they may humbly hope for <hi>converting</hi> Grace? For any therefore to inſinuate, as if <hi>unconverted</hi> Men would not do well to lay open their diſtreſſed Caſe before the Father of Mercies, by Prayer and Supplication, with Confeſſion, is not only, in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Conſequence, to arraign the <hi>Wiſdom of GOD's
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:005358_0019_1018225EADEEC230"/>
Appointments,</hi> but to reſtrain Men from <hi>that,</hi> without which they can have no good Hope, upon the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of CHRIST and the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> ever to expect the <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ſaving</hi> Grace of GOD.</p>
            <p>In fine, for I muſt not ſtay to multiply Particulars 'Tis an <hi>Error,</hi> and a very <hi>dangerous</hi> one too, ſo to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the <hi>Uſe</hi> and <hi>Deſign</hi> of the <hi>Righteouſneſs of</hi> CHRIST, as to ſuppoſe it takes away <hi>all Neceſſity</hi> of any <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of our own.</hi> Some, not having a clear and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct Notion of the Goſpel <hi>Uſe</hi> and <hi>Deſign</hi> of CHRIST'S <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> and of <hi>our own,</hi> have ſpoken of theſe Things ſo as to reflect Diſhonor on CHRIST, while they might intend to exalt him. The Uſe of <hi>our own Righteouſneſs.</hi> in the <hi>Goſpel-plan</hi> is not to entitle us to Salvation, there is no <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of it for this; nor is it ſufficient to anſwer ſuch a Purpoſe. When we have done our beſt, we are unprofitable Servanrs, as having fallen ſhort of our Duty: And therefore it cannot be by any <hi>Works of Righteouſneſs which we have done,</hi> that we are <hi>juſtified</hi> and <hi>ſaved;</hi> but for the Sake of CHRIST, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of what he <hi>did</hi> and <hi>ſuffered,</hi> when he ſtood in the Place of Sinners. This therefore is the <hi>Uſe</hi> of the <hi>Righteouſneſs of</hi> CHRIST: 'Tis our <hi>Title</hi> to Heaven, <hi>that</hi> on the Account of which we are intereſted in the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of GOD to eternal Life. But tho' it is on the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of CHRIST'S <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> that we are <hi>juſtified</hi> and <hi>ſaved,</hi> and it would be highly injurious to his Merits to ſuppoſe otherwiſe; yet this by no Means takes away the Neceſſity of <hi>perſonal inherent Righteouſneſs.</hi> This alſo has its <hi>Uſe,</hi> and is <hi>equally neceſſary</hi> in its Place. It is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary on other Accounts, though not as our <hi>Title</hi> to Heaven. 'Tis required in the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and ſo becomes <hi>neceſſary</hi> by <hi>Divine Appointment;</hi> yea, and of ſuch Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance was this Appointment, that <hi>GOD ordain'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Foundation of the World,</hi> that Chriſtians ſhould <hi>walk in thoſe good Works,</hi> unto which they are diſpos'd and prepar'd, when they become, a ſecond Time, <hi>his Workmanſhip,</hi> being <hi>created anew in</hi> CHRIST JESUS. And
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:005358_0020_101822618D238E50"/>
'tis by <hi>inherent perſonal Righteouſneſs,</hi> and by this <hi>only,</hi> that Men become the <hi>capable Subjects</hi> of Salvation in Heaven. Without this, they would not be <hi>meet</hi> for the Enjoyment of it; nor could they be any more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, as reaſonable Creatures, moral Agents, than <hi>Light could have Communion with Darkneſs,</hi> or CHRIST <hi>with Belial.</hi> But I muſt not enlarge—To go on,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Miniſters ſhould <hi>take heed to their Doctrine,</hi> that it be <hi>important,</hi> not <hi>trifling</hi> and <hi>Uſeleſs.</hi> 'Tis obſervable, there were, at the Time when PAUL wrote this Epiſtle to TIMOTHY, certain <hi>Teachers</hi> in the Church of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> who gave heed to <hi>Fables, doting about Queſtions, and ſtriving about Words to no Purpoſe.</hi> And it was, no Doubt, in Oppoſition to the <hi>prophane and vain-babbling</hi> of theſe <hi>Teachers,</hi> that he enjoins it no TIMOTHY <hi>to take heed to his Doctrine,</hi> and elſewhere, in expreſs Terms, <hi>not to give heed to Fables, which miniſter Queſtions, rather than godly Edifying;</hi> hereby exhibiting a juſt Idea of that Preaching which is not calculared to anſwer the great Ends of the Miniſtry, in building Men up in Faith and Holineſs; teaching us to eſteem in rather <hi>tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling</hi> than <hi>preaching;</hi> as being of little more Significancy than a <hi>Fable,</hi> an idle Tale that is told. The Buſineſs of preaching is the greateſt and moſt important that can be. It has to do with Men's <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Concerns, to inſtruct them in what they are to <hi>believe</hi> and <hi>practiſe,</hi> in Order to their ſerving GOD acceptably here, and being eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happy in the Enjoyment of him hereafter. And ſhall Miniſters trifle in ſo ſolemn and Affair? Shall the Peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arities of a Party, the Externals of Religion, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalities of Worſhip, ſwallow up all their Time and Thoughts? Shall they bring every nice diſputable Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Pulpit, and deal perpetually in wrangling Controverſies, which tend not to Holineſs? It is true, they are exhorted to <hi>contend for the Faith;</hi> and they ſhould be bold in Defence of the great and ſubſtantial Truths of Religion, thoſe that are of conſiderable Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to the Souls of Men: But for <hi>fooliſh Queſtions,</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:005358_0021_10182263265D03B0"/>
and <hi>needleſs Diſputes</hi> they ſhould not trouble themſelves, or their People with them. The Subjects of their Preaching ſhould be the main and neceſſary Articles of Faith, and Rules of Life. Theſe they ſhould dwell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; theſe ſhould be the great Scope of their Diſcourſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; Theſe they ſhould have principally in View, even when diſcourſing upon comparatively leſs important Points. And they ſhould be abundant in Labors to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, and eſtabliſh theſe great and eſſential Principles of Religion; eſpecially when there is Danger, leſt <hi>Shipwreck ſhould be made of Faith and a good Conſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Miniſters ſhould <hi>take heed to their Doctrine,</hi> that it be <hi>real,</hi> not <hi>imaginary.</hi> What they preach ſhould have ſome ſolid Foundation; it ſhould be Truth bottomed on the Word of GOD, and not a meer Notion, a Fancy that has Exiſtence no where but in their own over-heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Brains.</p>
            <p>Some, perhaps, may think this a needleſs Caution: But if they do, it is becauſe they are ignorant of the World, yea, and of their <hi>Bibles</hi> too. There have always been <hi>viſionary, enthuſiaſtical</hi> Men; pretending to an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary</hi> Miſſion from GOD, and preaching for <hi>Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of his,</hi> the <hi>Suggeſtions of their own vain Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> So it was in <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> Times. Hence that Paſſage directed to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, Jer. 23. 16. <hi>Thus ſaith the</hi> LORD <hi>of Hoſts, hearken not unto the Words of the Prophets that propheſie unto you: they make you vain; they ſpeak a Viſion of their own Heart, and not out of the Mouth of the</hi> LORD. To the ſame Purpoſe it follows in the 25. 26. 27. 32. Verſes. <hi>I have heard what the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets ſaid, that propheſie Lies in my Name, ſaying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed. How long ſhall this be in the Hearts of the Prophets that propheſie Lies? Yea, they are Prophets of the Deceit of their own Hearts; which think to cauſe my People to forget my Name by their Dreams, which they tell every Man to his Neighbour.—Behold, I am against them that propheſie falſe Dreams, ſaith the</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:005358_0022_10182266047BC038"/>
LORD, <hi>and do tell them, and cauſe my People to err by their Lies: Yet I ſent them not, nor commanded them: therefore they ſhall not profit this People at all, ſaith the</hi> LORD. And ſo it has been in all Ages of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church; yea, there have not been wanting Inſtances, even in our own Day, of thoſe, who under the vain No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of being <hi>extraordinarily</hi> ſent of God, have gone about venting their <hi>own wild Imaginations</hi> for <hi>divine Truths,</hi> to the great Reproach of CHRIST, and Scandal of Religion. Miniſters then ſhould <hi>take heed to their Doctrine,</hi> that it be the <hi>real</hi> Truth of GOD, and not dare utter any Thing, as coming from him, but what they can prove does ſo. 'Tis not enough that they have an <hi>Impulſe on their Spirits,</hi> that they are under <hi>ſuppoſed Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions from above.</hi> Theſe muſt all be examined by the Rule of GOD's <hi>Word. To the Law and to the Teſtimony.</hi> If we preach not agreable hereto, there will be neither Light nor Truth in what we ſay, be the Preſſure on our Minds ever ſo lively, or the Thing ſuggeſted to us of ever ſo much Weight in our own Imaginations. I go on to ſay,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Miniſters ſhould not only take heed to themſelves, and unto their Doctrine, but <hi>continue in them.</hi> They ſhould hold out to the End, as to both.</p>
            <p>In Reſpect of <hi>themſelves,</hi> it is not enough that they appear to be Men of Piety for a while, but they muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways do ſo; ſhewing themſelves, through all the Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods of Life, <hi>Patterns of good Works, following after Righteouſneſs, Godlineſs, Faith, Patience, Meekneſs; keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves without Spot, and unrebukable until the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of our</hi> LORD JESUS CHRIST.</p>
            <p>And then as to their <hi>Doctrine,</hi> they muſt not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, but go on to preach that which ſhall tend to the <hi>Uſe of Edifying.</hi> It will not ſuffice, if, for a Time, they deliver the Doctrine which is <hi>according to Godlineſs;</hi> but the ſame ſound, pure, good Doctrine ſhould run thro'
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:005358_0023_1018226B564D80D0"/>
the whole Courſe of their Preaching. Their Sermons, from firſt to laſt, ſhould breathe the true Spirit of the Goſpel, and be a Teſtimony for them, that they have not <hi>fallen from their Stedfaſtneſs,</hi> but continue <hi>ſtrong in the Faith,</hi> that Faith which, by CHRIST and his <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> was <hi>once delivered to the Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But 'tis more than Time that I paſs to the next Head of Diſcourſe, which is,</p>
            <p>II. To conſider the <hi>ſpecial Motive</hi> with which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> inforces the <hi>Duty</hi> in the <hi>Text;</hi> Namely, <hi>For in doing this, thou ſhalt ſave both thyſelf, and them that hear thee.</hi> Here it may be ſaid,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Miniſters by doing their Duty will <hi>ſave themſelves.</hi> The Salvation here ſpoken of means Salvation in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World, Salvation from Wrath, Salvation with eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Glory. And what a Motive is this to <hi>take heed to themſelves, and to their Doctrine,</hi> to look well to their <hi>Temper</hi> and <hi>Conduct,</hi> both as <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and <hi>Miniſters?</hi> They cannot, unleſs they are thus careful, obtain Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Meerly their Character, as <hi>Officers</hi> in the Kingdom of CHRIST, will not ſecure them from Danger, in the <hi>great Day of GOD's Wrath. Judas,</hi> though called to be an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> Yet, went to his own <hi>Place.</hi> And our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> aſſures us that <hi>many,</hi> in the Day of his Appearing to judge the World in Righteouſneſs, who <hi>propheſied in his Name,</hi> will be doom'd to a <hi>Departure from him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Workers of Iniquity.</hi> And of all Men, wicked and unfaithful Miniſters will receive the <hi>greateſt Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> It will not be enough that they are turned into Hell with the Nations that forget GOD; but by how much their Guilt has been aggravated beyond their's, by ſo much their <hi>Torment</hi> and <hi>Sorrow</hi> will be increaſed, in this Place of weeping, and wailing, and gnaſhing of Teeth. An awful Conſideration ſurely! It ſhould make us, to whom it hath pleaſed GOD to commit the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of the Goſpel, look to <hi>ourſelves,</hi> and to our
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:005358_0024_1018226D22FB8548"/>
               <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> leſt, when we have preached to others, we our ſelves ſhould be <hi>Caſt-aways.</hi> If PAUL, that Man of GOD, who was not behind the <hi>chiefeſt</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> no, not in <hi>Grace,</hi> any more than <hi>Gifts,</hi> makes this Suppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Reſpect of <hi>himſelf,</hi> much more may we, who are ſo far below him in all <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> as well as <hi>miniſterial</hi> Accompliſhments. We ſhould be jealous over our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with a godly Jealouſy, and lay ourſelves out, with all Diligence and Fidelity, to do the Work we are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, as <hi>private</hi> Men, and as intruſted with the <hi>Charge</hi> of <hi>Souls.</hi> And ſhall not we be quickned hereto from the Conſideration, that, <hi>in doing thus, we ſhall ſave our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?</hi> The Salvation of Heaven will be infinitely more than a Recompence for all our Labor and Pains, for all our Services and Trials, in fulfilling our Miniſtry. Nor is it all, that we ſhall be ſaved: But our Salvation ſhall be diſtinguiſhingly great and glorious, in Proportion to the <hi>Degree</hi> of our prudent Zeal, and active Fidelity in our LORD's Work. This ſuppoſes <hi>Degrees,</hi> of Glory in the coming World. And our <hi>Saviour</hi> himſelf ſuppoſes the ſame Thing, when he ſpeaks of a <hi>Prophet's Reward,</hi> and diſtinguiſhes it from a <hi>righteous Man's Reward:</hi> And the Apoſtle PAUL ſuppoſes the ſame Thing, or rather directly affirms it, when he ſays, <hi>There is one Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Sun, and another Glory of the Moon, and another Glory of the Stars: So alſo is the Reſurrection of the Dead.</hi> And if there are <hi>Degrees</hi> of Bleſſedneſs in GOD's heavenly Kingdom, thoſe certainly bid the faireſt to be advanced to the higheſt of them, who ſpend themſelves, and are ſpent in watching for Souls, the Souls of other Men, as well as their own: And they ſhall aſſuredly <hi>ſhine,</hi> in the other World, <hi>as the Brightneſs of the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament, and as the Stars for ever and ever.</hi> But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Miniſters, by taking heed to themſelves, and to their Doctrine, will not only ſave themſelves, but <hi>them that hear them.</hi> Not that this will always certainly be the Effect. Such a Senſe of the Words is contrary to the Truth of <hi>Fact,</hi> and irreconcilable with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:005358_0025_1018227201165200"/>
which the wiſeſt and moſt faithful Miniſters, the World ever ſaw, have often made on Account of their Want of Succeſs. <hi>Who hath believed our Report? To whom hath the Arm of the LORD been revealed?</hi> So ſpake <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> that inſpir'd Meſſenger of GOD to his People <hi>Iſrael</hi> And a greater than <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> the SON of GOD himſelf, is repreſented in the New Teſtament, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moaning the Unſucceſsfulneſs of his Miniſtry, in theſe ſame Words of bitter Complaint, as you may ſee, Joh. 12. 37, 38. And ſo far, ſometimes, are even faithful Miniſters from <hi>ſaving</hi> the People they are ſent to, that their Preaching is unhappily the Means of their being ſtill more hardened in Sin. So it was with the very <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles</hi> of CHRIST. Hence that Remark of PAUL, 2. Cor. 2. 16. <hi>To the one, we are a Savour of Death unto Death.</hi> Yea, the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was <hi>immediately</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned by GOD to go, and preach to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> People, when the woful Effect is declared in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion it ſelf. <hi>Go,</hi> (ſays GOD to him, Chap. 6. v. 9. 10.) <hi>tell this People, hear ye indeed, but underſtand not; and ſee ye indeed, but perceive not. Make the Heart of this People fat, and make their Ears heavy, and ſhut their Eyes; leſt they ſee with their Eyes, and hear with their Ears, and underſtand with their Heart, and convert and be healed.</hi> 'Tis indeed an awful Thing when People receive no ſaving Advantage from the Miniſtry of the Word; and it is ſtill more awful, when it proves an Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of making their hard Hearts harder, and their blind Eyes blinder; and godly faithful Miniſters may be exceedingly grieved, and bowed down hereat: Tho', even in this Caſe, they may aſſure themſelves they <hi>are unto GOD a ſweet Savour in</hi> CHRIST <hi>in them that are ſaved, and in them that periſh. Their Judgment is with the LORD, and their Work with their GOD: And tho' Israel is not gathered, they ſhall be glorious in the Eyes of the LORD, and GOD ſhall be their Strength.</hi> But to return,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:005358_0026_101822749042A4B8"/>
When Miniſters are urged to Heedfulneſs in the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of their, Duty, from the Conſideration, that they ſhall <hi>ſave them that hear them,</hi> it muſt not be underſtood, I ſay, in too rigorous a Senſe, as if People might not fail of the Grace of GOD, and of entring into Heaven, though they are <hi>faithful.</hi> But the Meaning rather is, that, when Miniſters prudently and heedfully attend the proper Duties of their Office, they make Uſe of a ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and well adapted Means to promote the Salvation of Souls; yea, a Means which GOD has inſtituted to this End, and in the Uſe of which they may humbly hope for ſuch concurring Influences of divine Grace, as ſhall be made effectual to the Accompliſhment of it. It is by the Ordinance of preaching, that it pleaſes GOD to ſave them that believe. This is the wiſe Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Heaven to bring about this Purpoſe of Divine Mercy. And who ſo likely to be ſucceeded in this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of ſaving Souls, as thoſe who look to their own Hearts and Lives, and expreſs a ſuitable Care, at all Times, to preach the pure uncorrupted Word of GOD? Theſe, of all Miniſters, have moſt Reaſon to expect the Bleſſing of GOD on their Labors: And if the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sinners does not follow upon the Word preached by them, they are not to Blame, but thoſe that hear them.</p>
            <p>And what a noble Incentive to heedful Diligence is this? Where is our Love to the People of our Charge, where our Compaſſion for their precious Souls, if this Motive lies not with Weight upon our Minds? The Proſpect of eternally ſaving them who hear us, ſhould warm our Hearts, animate our Powers, and inſpire our Endeavours with Life and Vigor. If we might but be happily inſtrumental in promoting the everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Felicity of a Number of the loſt Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> how highly would GOD honor us? What Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould we have for holy Rejoicing? How ſhould we exult in the Preſence of the LORD JESUS CHRIST at his Coming? And how unſpeakably bleſſed ſhould we be in the Kingdom of our Father, having ſuch Seals of our
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:005358_0027_101822761EE9F890"/>
Miniſtry to be unfading and eternal Crowns of Glory to us?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Application</hi> remains. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. How very <hi>ſolemn</hi> is the Work of Miniſters! We have not only our <hi>own</hi> Souls to anſwer for, but the Souls of <hi>our People.</hi> Our Charge, as Miniſters, is like that, 1 Kin. 20. 39. <hi>Keep this Man; if by any Means he be miſſing, then ſhall thy Life be for his Life.</hi> We are <hi>ſet Watchmen unto the Houſe of Iſrael:</hi> And if we receive the Word at GOD's Mouth, and faithfully declare it; warning the Wicked of their Way, &amp; perſwading them to turn from it, by the Terrors of the Law, and the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements of the Goſpel, we have delivered our Souls: If they die in their Iniquity, their Blood will not be required at our Hands. But if we are negligent to give Warning from GOD; if we flatter Men in their Sins, daubing them with untempered Mortar; if we preach to them our own <hi>Fancies,</hi> inſtead of the <hi>Truth</hi> of GOD; or, if the Truth we ſpeak be ſo mingled with Error, ſo over-clouded with blind Zeal, ſo accompanied with unguarded Conduct, as to be an Occaſion, in the natural Courſe of Things, of exciting Prejudices in Men's Minds against Religion, and hardening them in Sin; if they now die in their Iniquity, we may have Reaſon to fear, leſt GOD ſhould require their Blood at our Hands. And oh! how doleful is the Cry of Blood! the Blood of loſt and undone Souls! How inſupportable muſt be our Horror, to behold the People of our Charge, in the Place of future Torment, and to hear their bitter Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrations; charging their Ruin upon us, our bad Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, which corrupted their Minds; our bad Example, which encouraged them in Sin; our Remiſſneſs in our Ministry, which ſuffered them to go on in their evil Ways, till their Feet took hold on Death! Can we think of this, and not realiſe what an awful Work we are engaged in? 'Tis indeed the moſt ſolemn, Man can be intruſted with.</p>

2. How <hi>unable</hi> are Miniſters, in <hi>their own Strength,</hi> to <hi>diſcharge</hi> the <hi>Duties</hi> of <hi>their Office!</hi> This Reflection I take from PAUL, who, when he had been diſcourſing on the Work of the Miniſtry, exclaims in that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, <hi>Who is ſufficient for theſe Things!</hi> And if the great <hi>Apoſtle</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who, beſides his ſtrong na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Genius, and acquired Learning, had the HOLY GHOST plentifully poured out upon him, not only in <hi>miraculous Gifts,</hi> but high Degrees of <hi>ſanctifying Grace;</hi> I ſay, if the Apoſtle PAUL, under all theſe Advantages, was filled with a humbling Senſe of his own <hi>Inſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> for this arduous Undertaking, with how much more Reaſon may the preſent ordinary Miniſters of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel cry out of their own Weakneſs? 'Tis not an eaſy Thing, <hi>my Brethren,</hi> to acquit ourſelves with Fidelity and Honor in the Miniſtry of the Goſpel. Our Buſineſs is to ſave the Souls of them that hear us. And O what Skill is requiſite ſo to diſpenſe the Goſpel, as that it may operate in a kind and ſutable Manner, to accompliſh this bleſſed End! What Knowledge, what Wiſdom, what Heedfulneſs, are neceſſary, ſo to convey its Truths, as that they may, with Eaſe and Freedom, enter into Men's Minds; So to repreſent its Laws, as that they may feel their Reaſonableneſs and Beauty, and be in Love with them; So to urge its Motives, the precious Promiſes and awful Threatnings revealed in it, as that they may have a joint Influence upon their <hi>Hopes</hi> and <hi>Fears,</hi> preſerving a due Ballance between theſe grand Springs of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Action? To diſpenſe the Goſpel ſo as that it may not, through any Fault of ours, be an Occaſion of Hurt but Good, is truly a very difficult Matter: And 'tis ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Pride, Ignorance, Inconſideration, or ſomething Worſe, if any imagine otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>When I have been moſt ſerious in my Thoughts on the Buſineſs of <hi>Preaching,</hi> viewing it as an <hi>Appointment</hi> of GOD to <hi>ſave Souls,</hi> I have been amazed, rather than pleaſed, to ſee Miniſters venture into the Pulpit, to ſpeak upon the great Affairs of <hi>Salvation and Damnation,</hi> with
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:005358_0029_1018227AF6074C80"/>
out any previous Fore-thought. They might, perhaps, depend upon <hi>extraordinary</hi> Communications from above: But they herein deluded themſelves, and impoſed upon others. None have Reaſon, from the <hi>Bible,</hi> to expect any Aſſiſtance from the SPIRIT, much leſs that which is <hi>extraordinary,</hi> while they neglect their Duty in the Uſe of common Means: And it is too often viſible, that they receive none by the Things which they deliver.</p>
            <p>Nor have I been leſs amazed at the <hi>Forwardneſs</hi> of many, who, in theſe Days, without any acquired Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments, have thought themſelves qualified, and in an <hi>extempore-Way</hi> too, to addreſs to large Auditories, upon the important Concerns of everlaſting Salvation. 'Tis ſtrange any ſhould entertain ſuch ſlight Thoughts of that, which the <hi>Scripture</hi> teaches us to look upon as an <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of JESUS CHRIST. And yet, this has been the Way of too many, in all Ages of the Church. There were thoſe, even in the Times of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> who <hi>deſired to be Teachers of the Law, underſtanding nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what they ſaid, nor whereof they affirmed,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 7. And the ſame Complaint may be juſtly made of <hi>theſe Times:</hi> For which Reaſon People need be admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, <hi>not to heap to themſelves</hi> ſuch <hi>Teachers, having itching Ears.</hi> I am ſure, if Men had but juſt Tho'ts of the Reference which Preaching has to the <hi>Salvation of Souls,</hi> and the great <hi>Heedfulneſs</hi> which is neceſſary in Preachers, both in Reſpect of <hi>themſelves,</hi> and their <hi>Doctrine,</hi> they would not be over-forward in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; eſpecially, if they had never taken Pains by Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Meditation, and Study, to acquire the needed Accompliſhments for this momentous Work. The beſt qualified Men have been awfully ſenſible of their Inſufficiency for it: Nor can we who are Miniſters have too ſtrong a Senſe upon our Minds of the Need we ſtand in of Help from CHRIST; that it is he, and he only, who <hi>enables thoſe whom he puts into the Miniſtry.</hi> This would make us <hi>prayerful;</hi> and give us the moſt
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:005358_0030_1018227F9FD56DE8"/>
hopeful Proſpect of a Supply from the SPIRIT of JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST, according to our Need.</p>
            <p n="3">3. What has been ſaid affords Matter of ſerious <hi>Self-Reflection</hi> to Miniſters. Who of us dare ſay we are free from Blame? We have all our Faults and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and abundant Reaſon herefrom for deep Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation before GOD. Let us this Day review our <hi>Temper</hi> and <hi>Conduct,</hi> both as <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us look into <hi>our ſpiritual State.</hi> Others cannot determine this, nor have they any Right or Buſineſs to meddle with it. But to <hi>us</hi> it is a Matter of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Importance to <hi>know our own ſelves.</hi> And in Order to this we ſhould <hi>prove our own ſelves, how that</hi> CHRIST JESUS <hi>is in us; except we be</hi> diſallowed of GOD. Let us put the Queſtion each one to his own Soul, Have I ever felt the Power of thoſe divine Truths which I preach to others? Has CHRIST JESUS, his Image and Likeneſs, <hi>been formed in me?</hi> Am I that holy, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, meek, patient, contented, righteous, charitable Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever on the SON of GOD, I call upon others to be? If, upon an impartial Examination, we have the divine SPIRIT <hi>witneſſing with our own Spirits,</hi> that we are thus Chriſtians indeed, we may have Confidence towards GOD. And O what a bleſſed Spring of Conſolation would this be to us, under the hard Cenſures, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Reproaches that are caſt upon us in this Day of Trial! Now might we take to ourſelves the Words of the holy Apoſtle PAUL, and ſay, <hi>It is a very ſmall Thing that I ſhould be judged of you, or of Man's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: He that judgeth me is the LORD:</hi> Yea, we might exult in that triumphing Language of his, <hi>Who ſhall lay any Thing to the Charge of GOD's Elect? It is GOD that juſtifieth, who is he that condemneth? It is</hi> CHRIST <hi>that died, yea rather that is riſen again, who is even at the right Hand of GOD, who alſo maketh Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for us:</hi> Nor ſhall any Thing be ever able
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:005358_0031_1018228230854F78"/>
to ſeparate us from the Love of GOD in JESUS CHRIST, or to prevent our Participation of the bleſſed Fruits of it, in his heavenly and everlaſting King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>But beſides our <hi>private</hi> Character as <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> we ſhould look back and conſider, what Care we have taken to fulfill our Miniſtry. It might be of Service to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect after ſome ſuch Manner as this, Was my Aim right in coming into the Miniſtry? Had I an honeſt upright Intention? Was it my main View to honor CHRIST in doing Good to Souls by promoting their Salvation? And what has been my Conduct all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long in the Courſe of my Miniſtry? Have I made it my ſincere Endeavour to find out the true Way to Heaven, and to aſſiſt and direct my People in their Walk on in it? Have I lay'd out my main Strength in ſtudying and preaching CHRIST JESUS <hi>and him cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified?</hi> Have the great Truths of the Goſpel, thoſe wherein the Life and Power of Godlineſs conſiſt, been the principal Subjects of my Miniſtry? Have I in all Things approved myſelf to the Conſciences of my People, <hi>by Pureneſs, by Knowledge, by Long-ſuffering, by Kindneſs, by the</hi> HOLY GHOST, <hi>by Love unfeign'd, by the Armour of Righteouſneſs, on the Right Hand, and on the Left?</hi> Have I been conſtant in bowing the Knee to the GOD and FATHER of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, in humble fervent Prayer for Direction and Help, a Bleſſing on my Studies and Labours, and that my Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, with myſelf, might obtain the Salvation of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? We have now behav'd well in our Office; we have now done our beſt to ſerve the Intereſt of Souls: And if it ſhould pleaſe GOD to crown our Endeavours with Succeſs, O what a happy Meeting ſhould <hi>we,</hi> and the <hi>Souls begotten to GOD under our Miniſtry,</hi> have, in the Day of the Appearing of the SON of MAN! Then ſhould we, in Raptures of Joy, be able to ſay to the great SAVIOUR as well as Judge of Men, <hi>Here,</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:005358_0032_10182284BA7339F0"/>
LORD, <hi>are we and the Children thou haſt graciouſly given us:</hi> And both <hi>we</hi> and <hi>they</hi> ſhould go away into Life eternal.</p>
            <p n="4">4. How reaſonable is it <hi>People</hi> ſhould take heed to themſelves that they may <hi>ſave their own Souls!</hi> And how inexcuſeable will they be, if they <hi>neglect ſo great Salvation! Brethren,</hi> 'tis that you might be ſaved, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly ſaved, that we your Miniſters have had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us the Deſpenſation of the Goſpel. And our Hearts Deſire, and Prayer to GOD for you is, that you may be ſaved: And GOD, I truſt, is our Witneſs, that we would willingly ſpend and be ſpent in <hi>taking heed to our ſelves, and to our Doctrine,</hi> if we might but be the Means of your receiving Forgiveneſs of Sins, and Inheritance among them that are ſanctified by Faith that is in CHRIST. But this lies not ſo much with <hi>us,</hi> as with <hi>your ſelves.</hi> Our Deſires of your ſalvation, and moſt faithful Labours to promote it, won't be effectual, unleſs you are wrought upon to be thoughtful of your own Souls, and to look well to your ſelves, that you fail not of the Grace of God. O be perſuaded to pay a ſutable Regard to the Meſſages of GOD handed to you by our Miniſtry! Don't attend on our preaching for Faſhion's Sake, and becauſe 'tis the Cuſtom of the Country..—Don't come to hear the Word diſpenſed with Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, either againſt us, or the Truth of GOD delivered by us.—Don't let your Aim be to find Fault, and take Occaſion to cenſure and reproach us: But be ſerious in your Attendance on our Miniſtrations.—Look upon them as Means inſtituted by GOD to bring about your Salvation: And wait upon them as ſuch, with an awaken'd Senſe, which certainly becomes you, when treated with upon the Concerns of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death.</hi>—Let the Salvation of your Souls be your principal View in coming up to the Houſe of GOD. And whenever you come here, let it be with ſincere Deſires, and ardent Prayer, that you may receive ſpiritual and ſaving Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; that you may gain a true Knowledge of GOD and JESUS CHRIST; a real Conformity to the Divine Image;
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:005358_0033_1018228658658F48"/>
a Heart to do your Duty, and Strength to perform it; and in a Word, that you may have the Life of Grace begun in you, and carried on, as much as may be, to Perfection.</p>
            <p>And ſolemnly realiſe it, that you may finally periſh under the beſt Miniſtry in the World; yea, and that you certainly will periſh, if you do not make a wiſe and good Uſe of it. And if this ſhould be your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Caſe, you would be without <hi>all Excuſe.</hi> Said our <hi>Saviour</hi> to the <hi>Jews,</hi> John 15. 32. And it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually applicable to all Goſpel-Impenitents, <hi>If I had not come, and ſpoken to them, they had not had Sin; but now they have no Cloak for their Sin.</hi> If you hear not CHRIST ſpeaking to you, in the Miniſtry of the Word, you will have nothing to plead in your own Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. How then ſhall you eſcape? There is no Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of it: Nor will the Ruin of any Sinners be more dreadful than your's. No Sinners will be found to have abus'd greater Light and Grace; to have more highly provoked the holy GOD; to have more bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly grieved the good SPIRIT of GOD; to have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt richer Advantages, or more diſtinguiſhing Favours: And therefore none will drink deeper of the Cup of the LORD'S Indignation.—It ſhall be <hi>more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the Day of Judgment than for you.—But, Beloved, we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded better Things of you, and Things that accompany Salvation, though we thus ſpeak.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It will be but agreeable to the Occaſions of the Day, and the Expectations of the Auditory, if I now turn the Diſcourſe into an Addreſs; <hi>Firſt,</hi> To the <hi>Perſon</hi> who is to be fixed in the Miniſtry of the Goſpel in this Place; and <hi>then,</hi> to the <hi>People</hi> who are to be his more <hi>ſpecial Charge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis at your Deſire, <hi>Sir,</hi> that I ſtand here to ſtir up your pure Mind by Way of Remembrance, that you
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:005358_0034_1018228B08374D50"/>
may be mindful of the Commandment of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> of our Lord and Saviour which ſpeaketh on that wiſe, <hi>Take Heed to thy ſelf, and to thy Doctrine; continue in them.</hi> Your Care about <hi>yourſelf,</hi> that you might behave as is befitting a Miniſter of JESUS CHRIST, no one will gain ſay: And in the Courſe of your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, for a Number of Years, in another Part of GOD's Vineyard, you have not only approv'd your ſelf a Man well furniſhed with Gifts for the Miniſtry, but a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of <hi>good Doctrine, ſound Speech that cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</hi> We do therefore with the more Freedom recommend you to this People, and act in the Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of ſetting you over them in the LORD; hoping, and praying, and expecting, that you will be to them a heedful, painful, able Miniſter of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Let me adviſe you, <hi>Sir,</hi> To look well to the Frame of your own Heart. Get, and keep, as much as may be, a ſtrong and vigorous Senſe of ſpiritual and eternal Concerns. This will animate you in your Work, enli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven your Performances, give an Energy to your Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations, and be apt to engage the Attention of your People, and ſtrike their Minds with irreſiſtable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction.</p>
            <p>Let your Behaviour alſo be <hi>exemplary.</hi> This, more than any Thing, will ſtrengthen your Influence to do Good. It will reflect a Glory on your Character, and give a ſtrange Edge to your Diſcourſes to your Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whether in public or private: Whereas, if they don't find you to be a Man of Meekneſs, and Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Seriouſneſs and Sanctity, it will mightily take from that Veneration, which is neceſſary to prepare their Minds to receive what you ſay with Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:005358_0035_1018228EA88A20C8"/>
Take heed likewiſe to your <hi>Doctrine;</hi> eſpecially at this Day: For the Time is come, when many will not endure ſound Doctrine, but turn away their Ears from the Truth; and this, in Matters of no ſmall Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. The Evidences of Converſion; the Neceſſity of good Works; the Nature of the SPIRIT'S Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; the Uſe of the Holy Scriptures, and of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Miniſtry, have been egregiouſly miſunderſtood, and ſuch falſe Notions touching them ſpread abroad, as are deſtructive to Religion, and the Souls of Men. Be then upon the Watch. Continue in the Things which thou haſt learned, and haſt been aſſured of, knowing of whom thou haſt learned them. Hold faſt the faithful Word; and be always ready, not only to preach the Truth, but to ſtand up in its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; ſhewing that you are able, both to exhort, and convince the Gain-ſayers.</p>
            <p>And let me further recommend it to you to have a <hi>ſpecial Guard</hi> upon your <hi>Pulpit,</hi> and not ſuffer any, ſo far as your Influence will reach, to enter into it, whom you have Reaſon to think are wanting in <hi>Gifts for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification,</hi> or <hi>conſent not to wholeſome Words, even the Words of our</hi> LORD JESUS CHRIST, <hi>and to the Doctrine which is according to Godlineſs:</hi> Neither would you conſult the <hi>Intereſt of Religion</hi> among <hi>this People,</hi> on the <hi>Order of our Church-State,</hi> if you ſhould counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance that <hi>Itinerant</hi> Preaching, which has been the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of ſo much Contention in the Land. You are in <hi>Principle</hi> againſt this Kind of Preaching: It may therefore reaſonably be expected, you will act up to your Principles, and not give Way to any, who may go about from Pariſh to Pariſh, as though they had ſome <hi>extraordinary</hi> Miſſion from above. And I the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther take Occaſion to mention this, becauſe you will, probably, have a Trial of your <hi>Stedfaſtneſs</hi> in this Reſpect, as <hi>he</hi> who firſt gave Riſe to the <hi>Itinerancy,</hi> that has, of late, been ſo much in Practice, is again

come among us: And if the Practice ought to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged in any, much more in him who is the <hi>Patron</hi> as well as <hi>Origin</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>Suffer me, <hi>Sir,</hi> to <hi>beſeech you,</hi> and my <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Brethren</hi> in the Miniſtry, here preſent, will not take it amiſs, if I <hi>beſeech</hi> them alſo, <hi>to mark</hi> this Man <hi>who has cauſed Diviſions and Offences, contrary to the Doctrine which ye have learned, and to avoid him.</hi> Turn your View, my <hi>Brethren,</hi> into all Corners of the Land: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Confuſion in Towns; the Contention in Churches; the Alienations and Separations of People from one another, and from their Miniſters: Behold the Heat of Men's Spirits; the Wildneſs of their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations; the Errors of their Judgment; the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders of their Practice: Behold the unchriſtian Spirit of Cenſoriouſneſs that has broke looſe, urging Men on to the moſt uncharitable Conduct towards Neighbours and Friends; towards Brethren by <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Church Fellowſhip;</hi> and eſpecially towards Miniſters, though ſound in the Faith, and viſibly of a good Converſation in CHRIST: Take a View, I ſay, of theſe Things, whereby many of our Churches are ſo crumbling to Pieces, that there is a Call almoſt every Week, for the Help of Eccleſiaſtical Councils, in one Place, or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and then conſider, whether it is not high Time to put on Courage, and make a Stand for the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of Religion and good Order. And is it poſſible you ſhould do this, if you ſtrengthen the Influence of <hi>him,</hi> who is the <hi>true Source</hi> of moſt of this Miſchief? If you invite him into your <hi>Pulpits,</hi> and teach your People to <hi>have his Perſon in Admiration?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Perhaps, it will be ſaid, theſe <hi>miſchievous</hi> Things are only <hi>accidental Effects,</hi> and not to be charg'd upon him. So far from it, that they are the unavoidable Conſequence of that <hi>Spirit</hi> in which he appear'd; and might eaſily have been foreſeen by any one tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:005358_0037_101822930326CB10"/>
acquainted with humane Nature. What might be expected, in the ordinary Courſe of Things, but that People ſhould be cenſorious and uncharitable, ſpeak ſlightily of Miniſters, and judge them to be <hi>carnal</hi> and <hi>unconverted,</hi> when <hi>the Man</hi> they admired, and followed, ſeldom preached, but he leavened their Minds with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Surmiſings of this Kind, and ſpake of the <hi>Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of them, in his Writings, conveyed into all Parts of the Land, <hi>as talking of an unknown, unfelt CHRIST?</hi> What might be expected but Alienations and Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from Miniſters, as uſeleſs to the Purpoſe of ſaving Souls, when People were taught, that the <hi>Deadneſs in their Congregations</hi> was owing to their having <hi>dead Men to preach to them,</hi> and theſe <hi>dead Men</hi> were compared to the <hi>Devil</hi> in Point of Serviceableneſs to promote their Converſion? What might be expected, but that People ſhould entertain an ill Opinion of our <hi>Colleges,</hi> and the <hi>Governors</hi> and <hi>Inſtructors</hi> of them, and have their Minds filled with Jealouſies leſt their Sons ſhould be train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in Error, when they were publickly told, <hi>That their Light was become Darkneſs;</hi> yea, <hi>Darkneſs that might be felt?</hi> What might be expected but that People ſhould run into all Manner of Wildneſs, Diſorder and Error, when they were inſtructed to give heed to <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſes</hi> and <hi>Impreſſions,</hi> and govern themſelves by <hi>meer Preſſures on their Minds,</hi> taking them for <hi>Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the Deity?</hi> 'Tis impoſſible but ſuch <hi>bad Pinciples</hi> ſhould appear in correſponding <hi>bad Effects.</hi> And ſhall the Man who had the firſt and greateſt Hand in diſſeminating <hi>theſe Principles all over the Country,</hi> be again careſſed, and diſtinguiſhed from all other Miniſters, as though, in Compare with him, they were not worthy to preach the Goſpel? Are we willing to ſee an Increaſe of our unhappy Diſorders? And yet, this will, undoubtedly, be the Caſe, if Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters don't now appear openly, and boldly, to prevent that Miſconduct, which has already prov'd ſo detrimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to theſe Churches.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="unknown:005358_0038_1018229611D9D300"/>
I fear there is a great deal of Guilt lying upon <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi> in doing no more, in the beginning of theſe Times, to check the Progreſs of thoſe Evils, which we are now groaning under: And to ſpeak freely, I attribute it <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally</hi> to their want of Courage to exhibit a due Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, in Seaſon, againſt <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Diſorders,</hi> and going on ſteadily to ſhew their Diſapprobation of them, that they are riſen to ſo great a Height. And if they diſcover the ſame fluctuating irreſolute Temper now, ſuffering thoſe, who have been the chief <hi>Sowers of Diſcord,</hi> to take their own Way, and do as they think fit, they may ſee Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to repent of their Cowardice when it is too late.</p>
            <p>I know it is the Thought of ſome, that <hi>this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> is now come with <hi>another ſpirit.</hi> But if he ſtill aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes the Character of an <hi>Itinerant,</hi> and retains his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of travelling about from Town to Town, all over this, and the neighbouring Provinces, where the Goſpel is already preached by <hi>fixed</hi> Paſtors, well qualified for their Work, 'tis not fit he ſhould be encouraged. The <hi>Bible</hi> knows of no ſuch <hi>Viſitor</hi> of the Churches. And the obvious Language of the Man who takes upon him this Character is, That the Paſtors of the Churches are not furniſhed for their Buſineſs, or are neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent and unfaithful in it; or that he, for his Part, is one of ſuperior Attainments, more ſanctified and better gifted; or has ſome <hi>extraordinary</hi> Commiſſion ſetting him above all other Miniſters. And the Tendency of the Thing it ſelf is bad. It ſtrikes directly at the <hi>Order</hi> of our <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Conſtitution, and threatens the intire Demolition of it. And can our Churches ſubſiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Order?</hi> 'Tis the Strength as well as Glory of all Societies whether <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> or <hi>Civil:</hi> Nor is it poſſible they ſhould long continue in being without it. And it naturally tends to Strife, and Envy, and Schiſm, and an undue Preference of one Miniſter to another, to the great Hindrance of the Goſpel. We have already ſeen ſuch Effects as theſe. And ſhall not this put us upon
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:005358_0039_10180E61D19F2778"/>
our Guard? If it does not, we ſhall throw our ſelves into further Difficulties with our Eyes open.</p>
            <p>I know it will be ſaid, <hi>Good</hi> has been done by the <hi>Iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations</hi> of this <hi>Gentleman.</hi> And who is ignorant that GOD may bring <hi>Good</hi> out of <hi>Evil.</hi> The Queſtion is, Whether this <hi>Itinerating</hi> Practice, in the Manner it has been taken up, does not tend, in the natural Courſe of Things, to all Kind of Diſorders? And if ſome Good has come of it, has it not thrown the Country into a Convulſion? Has not the Effect of it been, <hi>Hatred, Variance, Emulation, Wrath, Strife, Sedition, Hereſies, Bitterneſs, Clamour, Evil-ſpeaking?</hi> And are not theſe <hi>manifeſtly Works of the Fleſh? If ye have bitter Envying and Strife in your Hearts,</hi> the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily declares, <hi>this is not the Wiſdom that cometh from above.</hi> And <hi>where Envy and Strife is,</hi> he farther de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, <hi>there is Confuſion and every evil Work.</hi> And this ſame <hi>Apoſtle</hi> has ſet us <hi>Miniſters</hi> an Example, how we ſhould conduct in ſuch an unhappy State of Things. When there was <hi>Envy, and Strife, and Diviſion</hi> in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> does he ſtand by as a ſilent Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor? No, but ſets himſelf to do all that lay in his Power to hinder the Progreſs of theſe evil Things. And ſhall not we do likewiſe? And if we exert our ſelves to the utmoſt, can we do amiſs, when we have an inſpired Apoſtle for our Example?</p>
            <p>I am aware I have expoſed my ſelf in what I have now offered to the ill Opinion of many; and 'tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable they will reflect very ſeverely on me: Not that I am conſcious that I have given juſt Ground of the leaſt Offence to any. I would willingly pleaſe all Men, in all Things: But wherein I cannot pleaſe Men, and be the Servant of CHRIST, I am at no Loſs to know my Duty; and I thank GOD, I am in a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Mind, in the preſent Caſe, to do it. Men may call me an Oppoſer of that which is good, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow

on me any other odious Name: But no ſuch Things move me, while I have the Teſtimony of my Conſcience, that I aim at the Honor of CHRIST, and the Eſtabliſhment of theſe Churches in Peace, and Truth, and Holineſs. We ought, my <hi>Brethren,</hi> to ſpeak our Minds, and behave like Men, in this Time of Danger; neither falling in with the Humour of the Multitude, or fearing their Reſentments. Alas! what is the good Word of Man, in Compare with the Approbation of GOD, and our own Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? And whom ſhould we fear, <hi>Man,</hi> the utmoſt Extent of whoſe Power reaches no further than the <hi>Body?</hi> Or <hi>GOD, who can deſtroy both Body and Soul in Hell?</hi> We ſhall, no Doubt, meet with fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Trials of our Faith and Patience, and all our other Graces, in a Day of ſuch uncommon Trouble. The People in this Land have a more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Itch</hi> to run after <hi>Strangers.</hi> So it was in <hi>former Days;</hi> And we have ſeen it to be ſo in our <hi>own Day.</hi> And this <hi>Weakneſs,</hi> we may expect, will be an Occaſion of great <hi>Difficulty;</hi> and it may prove <hi>as great a Temptation:</hi> But if we don't, in all ſutable Ways, endeavour to guard againſt it, the Difficulty will probably be much greater. <hi>HE that is come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us may bring us into ſtill greater Bondage; to whom therefore we ſhould not give Place, no, not for an Hour, that the Truth of the Goſpel may continue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us.</hi> And do you think, if we put on Courage, and behave with Reſolution, it will turn out to our Diſadvantage? It may, poſſibly, for a while; but in the End we ſhall be no Loſers. We ſerve a good Maſter. And if we are faithful, he will amply reward us, in Proportion to all the Trials we are called to paſs through, for his Sake; and for the Sake of the Souls for whom he died: We ſhall hereafter be <hi>crowned with the far exceeding and eternal Weight of Glory.</hi>

I go on now to addreſs a few Words to the <hi>People</hi> uſually meeting in this Houſe. <hi>Beloved in the LORD,</hi> we join with you in bowing the Knee to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> who has given you <hi>Oneneſs of Heart</hi> in the Choice of a Man to be <hi>ſet over the Congregation.</hi> Accept him as a Gift from the aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, enthroned JESUS: And do whatever lies in your Power to aſſiſt and encourage him in his Miniſtrations among you. Free him, as much as may be, from the Cares of the World, that he may <hi>give himſelf wholly to theſe Things.</hi> Do ye not know, that they which mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter about holy Things, live of the Things of the Temple? And they which wait at the Altar, are Partakers with the Altar? Even ſo hath the LORD <hi>ordained</hi> that they which preach the Goſpel ſhould live of the Goſpel? And if he, who is your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, ſows unto you <hi>ſpiritual Things,</hi> you will not eſteem it a great Thing, if he ſhould reap of your <hi>carnal Things.</hi> Who goeth a Warfare any Time at his own Charge? Who planteth a Vineyard, and eateth not of the Fruit thereof? Or, who feedeth a Flock, and eateth not of the Milk of the Flock? Say I theſe Things as a Man? Or ſaith not the Law the ſame alſo? And you will, doubtleſs, find your Account in well ſupporting your <hi>Paſtor.</hi> He will, by this Means, be able to make better Proviſion for your Souls. And what <hi>ſaith the</hi> LORD <hi>of Hoſts? Prove me now herewith, if I will not pour you out a Bleſſing.</hi>—And as you have ſelected him from others to be your <hi>Paſtor,</hi> let him have the Preference in your Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Don't ſuffer any <hi>wandring Stranger</hi> to alienate your Hearts from him: This, in the End, will be unprofitable for you: But cheriſh an inward real Regard to him. Honour him in the LORD, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem him very highly for his Work's Sake.—Don't be ſhy to make him acquainted with your <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Trials and Difficulties. Don't go to <hi>others</hi> to the Neglect, or rather Contempt of him; as though he
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:005358_0042_101822A0F3F00D10"/>
had not Skill in ſuch Matters, or would not lay him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf out, in all proper Ways, to ſute and ſerve you. This has been a Fault too common in theſe Times: And it has too much tended to <hi>that glorying in Men,</hi> which an inſpir'd <hi>Apoſtle</hi> has cautioned againſt.—Don't be offended, if he deals plainly and faithfully with you; telling you of your Sins, and reproving you for them. He would be greatly wanting in his Duty, if he ſhould ſuffer Sin upon you. He is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected of GOD to <hi>reprove</hi> and <hi>rebuke,</hi> as well as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort, with all Long ſuffering.—Don't think it ſtrange if you ſhould diſcern in him Frailties and Imperfections. This is no more than may be expected, conſidering he is a <hi>Man of like Paſſions with yourſelves.</hi> You ſhould therefore cover his Infirmities with the Mantle of Charity, and ever be in a Diſpoſition, not to aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate his Failings, but to make all kind Allowances, exerciſing Love and Candour towards him.—And let me <hi>beſeech you, Brethren, for the LORD JESUS CHRIST's Sake, and for the Love of the SPIRIT, to ſtrive in your Prayers to GOD for him.</hi> Make Mention of him without ceaſing in your <hi>Families</hi> and <hi>Cloſets,</hi> that he may be a rich Bleſſing to <hi>your ſelves,</hi> and to <hi>your Children.</hi>—Above all, let your profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, under his Miniſtry, appear to all around you. Think it not enough, that the Goſpel by him is preached to you. This <hi>alone</hi> won't be ſufficient. It muſt have its <hi>proper Influence,</hi> both on your <hi>Hearts</hi> and <hi>Lives;</hi> on your <hi>Hearts,</hi> conforming them to the <hi>Image</hi> of the bleſſed GOD, and his Son JESUS CHRIST; and on your <hi>Lives,</hi> making them ſuch, in all Sobriety, Righteouſneſs, and Godlineſs, as the Goſpel requires: In order thereto, let your Minds be open to Inſtruction.—Be ready to embrace the Truth in the Love of it.—Receive the Word with Meekneſs and Faith, and be ever willing to yield Obedience to it: So will you <hi>honour</hi> your <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> and be the <hi>Glory</hi> of your <hi>Paſtor;</hi> his
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:005358_0043_101822A40A3EE8D8"/>
               <hi>Joy</hi> here, and <hi>Crown</hi> in the <hi>Day</hi> of the <hi>Manifeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> of the SON of GOD.</p>
            <p>I cannot break off without lamenting the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Diſſenſion there has been in this Town, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Redeemer has been diſhonored, Religion wounded, and Satan gratified. Who have been the blameable Cauſes, is not for me to ſay; nor what might have prevented it.—We heartily wiſh a Bleſſing out of the Houſe of the LORD to the <hi>other Church</hi> and <hi>Paſtor. Grace, Mercy, and Peace, be mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied to them from the GOD and FATHER of our LORD JESUS CHRIST!</hi> And wherein any, on either Part, have ſaid, or done any Thing amiſs, the good LORD pardon them for his Mercies Sake in JESUS CHRIST!</p>
            <p>And may the <hi>GOD of Love and Peace</hi> unite <hi>Miniſters</hi> and <hi>Churches</hi> in this Day of Contention! And may we all finally have Admiſſion granted to us into that coming Kingdom of GOD, where no Offence ſhall be given, or taken; where there ſhall be no Variance or Strife, but Love and Charity in Perfection forever! Till which bleſſed Time, let us encourage our ſelves to hope for the Fulfillment of that <hi>Prayer</hi> of our SAVIOUR for the Profeſſors of his Religion, John 17. 21. <hi>That they all may be</hi> ONE, AS THOU FATHER ART IN ME, AND I IN THEE; <hi>that they alſo may be</hi> ONE IN US: <hi>That the World may believe that thou haſt ſent me.</hi>
