            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>EDITORS PREFACE TO THE AMERICAN EDITION, WITH PLATES.</head>
            <p>THE following Poem was firſt publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in 1782, in the ſtate of Connecticut, where the Author was born, and received his education, and where he now reſides. It has paſſed through ſeveral impreſſions in this country, and Great-Britain, and has obtained univerſal celebrity.</p>
            <p>In 1792 a ſplendid edition of it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in London, with explanatory notes. So far as theſe notes contain facts, and ſerve to elucidate paſſages, which would be otherwiſe obſcure, they are <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:029659_0004_0FE212A7810CFB60"/>
in this edition: But as that London edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was publiſhed to anſwer the purpoſes of a party, and the Editor has taken the liberty to miſrepreſent the views of the Author, the preface and ſuch of the notes as were inſerted for that purpoſe, are here omitted. This is done at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the author, with whoſe permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, this edition is offered to the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can public.</p>
            <p>The deſign of the Poem will beſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from its general tenor. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, at the time the oppoſition of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica to the unjuſt claims of the Britiſh Parliament, was maturing into ſyſtem, liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Boſton with one of the principal projectors of American Independence. He eſpouſed the cauſe of his country, and became intimately acquainted with the tranſactions of the early revolutioniſts, and all the meaſures of the Britiſh agents, to counter-act the oppoſition. This appears by a number of Anecdotes, very humor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly related, in the courſe of the Poem.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="v" facs="unknown:029659_0005_0FE212A9E7BA93F8"/>That the Author is a warm friend of American Independence, is obvious, from the whole tenor of the work; and the principal ſcope of the Poem ſeems to have been, to ridicule the claims of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Parliament, and the meaſures purſued to enforce thoſe claims. At the ſame time, the abſurdities and miſconduct of his own countrymen have not eſcaped his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.</p>
            <p>The Author is no friend to monarchy, nor ariſtocracy; nor is he a raving de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocrat. He is a friend of republican go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and rational liberty—that liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which is ſecured by juſt laws, and a ſteady adminiſtration of juſtice. But it is not true that the Poem was written with the ſole view to ridicule any particular form of government.</p>
            <p>The ſcene of the Poem is laid in Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts, where the Revolution originated. The time is in 1775. M'FINGAL the hero, is deſigned to repreſent the tory fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:029659_0006_0FE212AC5156FED0"/>
in general: and HONORIUS, the whigs.</p>
            <p>It is unneceſſary to ſay any thing of the merit of the Poem. This is univerſally acknowledged; and the Poem will conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to be read and admired, while true taſte and ſcience adorn the civilized world. The Philoſopher in his cloſet, the travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler on his voyage, and the man of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at his fire-ſide, will always find M'FINGAL, an inſtructive friend, and a pleaſant companion.</p>
            <p>The Editors have taken particular pains, to render this edition, worthy of public patronage. The explanatory notes will give this impreſſion a great advantage over any American edition. Indeed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, many paſſages alluding to lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal cuſtoms, or deſcriptive of local tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, could not be underſtood by a great proportion of readers.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Plates</hi> added to this edition, are an improvement on all former ones,
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:029659_0007_0FE212AFF0FE30C8"/>
and cannot ſail to give it a decided pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</p>
            <p>In every reſpect the Editors flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the elegance of the work will do juſtice to this admired Poem; and they confide in the liberality of their country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to give due encouragement to this ſpecimen of American genius and induſtry.</p>
            <p>THE Notes in this Edition marked with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Commas, were inſerted by the Author in the firſt Edition; thoſe that are not ſo marked, are principally extracted and altered from a London Edition, Printed in the Year 1792.</p>

                  <p>In the winter of 1774 and 1775, the Britiſh army had been ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by their officers and the Tories to an ardent deſire to ſee hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities commence. But the inſtigators wiſhing the Americans to be the aggreſſors, uſed the following ſtratagem to compleat their purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>On the firſt of May, 1775, the king's ſtandard was to be erected at Worceſter, fifty miles from Boſton, when Lieutenant Colonel Neſbitt immortalized himſelf by executing this plan to promote the quarrel, and give the army an opportunity of their deſired revenge.</p>
                  <p>A ſoldier, according to his directions, ſold an old ruſty muſket to a countryman for three dollars, who brought vegetables to market. This could be no crime in the market-man, who had an undoubted right to purchaſe, and bear arms. He was, notwithſtanding, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſeized by Neſbitt, and conveyed to the guard-houſe, where he was confined all night. Early the next morning they ſtripped him naked, covere him with warm tar, and then with feathers, and conducted him to the north end of the town, then to the ſouth end, and as far as Liberty-Tree, where they diſmiſſed the man, through fear of the people, (who by this time had collected in large numbers,) and made a retreat to their barracks.</p>
                  <p>The party conſiſted of about thirty grenadiers of the 47th regiment with fixed bayonets, 20 drums and fifes playing the rogue's march, headed by Neſbitt with a drawn ſword.</p>
                  <p>The magiſtrates of the town waited on General Gage with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of this outrage; he pretended diſapprobation; but took no ſteps to cenſure the conduct of Neſbitt, or to do juſtice to the man who had ſuffered the violence.</p>
