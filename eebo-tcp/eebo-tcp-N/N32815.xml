            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE <hi>AMERICAN</hi> CRISIS. NUMBER I. BY THE AUTHOR OF COMMON SENSE.</head>
            <p>THESE are the times that try men's ſouls: The ſummer ſoldier and the ſunſhine patriot will, in this criſis, ſhrink from the ſervice of his country; but he that ſtands it now, deſerves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not eaſily conquered; yet we have this conſolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we eſteem too lightly:— It is dearneſs only that gives every thing its value. Heaven knows how to ſet a proper price upon its goods; and it would be ſtrange indeed, if ſo celeſtial an article as FREEDOM ſhould not be highly rated. Britain, with an army to enforce her tyranny, has declared, that ſhe has a right (<hi>not only to</hi> TAX) but <q>
                  <hi>to</hi> BIND <hi>us in</hi> ALL CASES WHATSOEVER,</q> and if being <hi>bound in that manner</hi> is not ſlavery, then there is not ſuch a thing as ſlavery upon earth. Even the expreſſion is impious, for ſo unlimited a power can belong only to GOD.</p>
            <p>Whether the Independence of the Continent was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared too ſoon, or delayed too long, I will not now enter into as an argument; my own ſimple opinion is, that had it been eight months earlier, it would have been much better. We did not make a proper uſe of laſt winter, neither could we, while we were in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent

But no great deal is loſt yet; all that Howe has been doing for this month paſt is rather a ravage than a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, which the ſpirit of the Jerſies a year ago would have quickly repulſed, and which time and a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution will ſoon recover.</p>
            <p>I have as little ſuperſtition in me as any man living, but my ſecret opinion has ever been, and ſtill is, that GOD almighty will not give up a people to military de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, or leave them unſupportedly to periſh, who had ſo earneſtly and ſo repeatedly ſought to avoid the calamities of war, by every decent method which wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom could invent. Neither have I ſo much of the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del in me, as to ſuppoſe, that HE has relinquiſhed the government of the world, and given us up to the care of devils; and as I do not, I cannot ſee on what grounds the king of Britain can look up to heaven for help againſt us; A common murderer, a highwayman, or a houſebreaker, has as good a pretence as he.</p>
            <p>It is ſurpriſing to ſee how rapidly a panic will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times run through a country. All nations and ages have been ſubject to them: Britain has trembled like an ague at the report of a French fleet of flat bottomed boats; and in the fourteenth century the whole Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh army, after ravaging the kingdom of France, was driven back like men petrified with fear; and this brave exploit was performed by a few broken forces collected
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:043115_0003_101CCC5CB82F6C40"/>
and headed by a woman, Joan of Arc. Would, that Heaven might inſpire ſome Jerſey maid to ſpirit up her countrymen, and ſave her fair fellow-ſufferers from ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage and raviſhment! Yet panics, in ſome caſes, have their uſes; they produce as much good as hurt. Their duration is always ſhort; the mind ſoon grows through them, and acquires a firmer habit than before. But their peculiar advantage is, that they are the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones of ſincerity and hypocriſy, and bring things and men to light, which might otherwiſe have lain for ever undiſcovered. In fact <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> they have the ſame effect on ſecret traitors, which an imaginary apparition would upon a private murderer. They ſift out the hidden thoughts of man, and hold them up in public to the world. Many a diſguiſed Tory has lately ſhown his head, that ſhall penitentially ſolemnize with curſes the day on which Howe arrived upon the Delaware.</p>
            <p>As I was with the troops at fort Lee, and marched with them to the edge of Pennſylvania, I am well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with many circumſtances, which thoſe, who lived at a diſtance, know but little or nothing of. Our ſituation there was exceedingly cramped, the place being on a narrow neck of land between the North river and the Hackenſack. Our force was inconſiderable, being not one fourth ſo great as Howe could bring againſt us. We had no army at hand to have relieved the garriſon, had we ſhut ourſelves up and ſtood on the defence. Our ammunition, light artillery, and the beſt part of our ſtores, had been removed upon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion that Howe would endeavour to penetrate the Jerſies, in which caſe fort Lee could be of no uſe to us; for it muſt occur to every thinking man, whether in the army or not, that theſe kind of field forts are only for temporary purpoſes, and laſt in uſe no longer than the enemy directs his force againſt the particular object, which ſuch forts are raiſed to defend. Such was our ſituation and condition at fort Lee on the morning of the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:043115_0004_101CCC51D6C6E6F0"/>
20th of November, when an officer arrived with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, that the enemy with 200 boats had landed about ſeven or eight miles above: Major Gen. Green, who commanded the garriſon, immediately ordered them under arms, and ſent expreſs to his Excellency General Waſhington at the town of Hackenſack, diſtant by the way of the ferry ſix miles. Our firſt object was to ſecure the bridge over the Hackenſack, which laid up the river between the enemy and us, about ſix miles from us and three from them. General Waſhington arrived in about three quarters of an hour, and march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the head of the troops towards the bridge, which place I expected we ſhould have a bruſh for; however they did not chuſe to diſpute it with us, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of our troops went over the bridge, the reſt over the ferry, except ſome which paſſed at a mill on a ſmall creek, between the bridge and the ferry, and made their way through ſome marſhy grounds up to the town of Hockenſack, and there paſſed the river. We brought off as much baggage as the waggons could contain, the reſt was loſt. The ſimple object was to bring off the garriſon, and to march them on till they could be ſtrengthened by the Jerſey or Pennſylvania militia, ſo as to be enabled to make a ſtand. We ſtaid four days at Newark, collected in our out poſts with ſome of the Jerſey militia, and marched out twice to meet the enemy on information of their being advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though our numbers were greatly inferior to theirs. Howe, in my little opinion, committed a great error in generalſhip, in not throwing a body of forces off from Staten Iſland through Amboy, by which means he might have ſeized all our ſtores at Brunſwick, and intercepted our march into Pennſylvania: But, if we believe the power of hell to be limited, we muſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe believe that their agents are under ſome providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial controul.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not now attempt to give all the particular, of our retreat to the Delaware; ſuffice it for the preſent to
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:043115_0005_101CABF32A29ABB0"/>
ſay, that both officers and men, though greatly haraſſed and fatigued, frequently without reſt, covering, or proviſion, the inevitable conſequences of a long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat bore it with a manly and a martial ſpirit. All their wiſhes were one, which was, that the country would turn out and help them to drive the enemy back. Voltaire has remarked, that King William never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to full advantage but in difficulties and in action; the ſame remark may be made on General Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, for the character fits him. There is a natural firmneſs in ſome minds which cannot be unlocked by trifles, but which, when unlocked, diſcovers a cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net of fortitude; and I reckon it among thoſe kind of public bleſſings, which we do not immediately ſee, that GOD hath bleſt him with uninterrupted health, and given him a mind that can even flouriſh upon care.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude this paper with ſome miſcellaneous remarks on the ſtate of our affairs; and ſhall begin with aſking the following queſtion, Why is it that the enemy hath left the New-England provinces, and made theſe middle ones the ſeat of war? The anſwer is eaſy: New-England is not infeſted with Tories, and we are. I have been tender in raiſing the cry againſt theſe men, and uſed numberleſs arguments to ſhew them their danger, but it will not do to ſacrifice a world to either their folly or their baſeneſs. The period is now arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in which either they or we muſt change our ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or one or both muſt fall. And what is a Tory? GOOD GOD! what is he? I ſhould not be afraid to go with an hundred Whigs againſt a thouſand Tories, were they to attempt to get into arms. Every Tory is a coward, for a ſervile, ſlaviſh, ſelf-intereſted fear is the foundation of Toryiſm; and a man under ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, though he may be cruel, never can be brave.</p>
            <p>But before the line of irrecoverable ſeparation be drawn between us, let us reaſon the matter together:
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:043115_0006_101CCC5369301140"/>
Your conduct is an invitation to the enemy, yet not one in a thouſand of you has heart enough to join him. Howe is as much deceived by you as the American cauſe is injured by you. He expects you will all take up arms, and flock to his ſtandard with muſkets on your ſhoulders. Your opinions are of no uſe to him, unleſs you ſupport him perſonally; for 'tis ſoldiers, and not Tories, that he wants.</p>
            <p>I once felt all that kind of anger, which a man ought to feel, againſt the mean principles that are held by the Tories: A noted one, who kept a tavern at Amboy, was ſtanding at his door, with as pretty a child in his hand, about eight or nine years old, as moſt I ever ſaw, and after ſpeaking his mind as freely as he thought was prudent, finiſhed with this unfatherly expreſſion, <q>Well! give me peace in my day.</q> Not a man lives on the Continent but fully believes that a ſeparation muſt ſome time or other finally take place, and a generous parent would have ſaid, <hi>"If there muſt be trouble, let it be in my day, that my child may have pence;"</hi> and this ſingle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, well applied, is ſufficient to awaken every man to duty. Not a place upon earth might be ſo happy as America. Her ſituation is remote from all the wrangling world, and ſhe has nothing to do but to trade with them. A man may eaſily diſtinguiſh in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf between temper and principle, and I am as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, as I am that GOD governs the world, that Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica will never be happy till ſhe gets clear of foreign dominion. Wars, without ceaſing, will break out till that period arrives, and the Continent muſt in the end be conqueror; for, though the flame of liberty may ſometimes ceaſe to ſhine, the coal never can expire.</p>
            <p>America did not, nor does not, want force; but ſhe wanted a proper application of that force. Wiſdom is not the purchaſe of a day, and it is no wonder that we ſhould err at firſt fitting off. From an exceſs of tenderneſs, we were unwilling to raiſe an army, and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:043115_0007_101CABEE63694EC0"/>
truſted our cauſe to the temporary defence of a well meaning militia. A ſummer's experience has now taught us better; yet with thoſe troops, while they were collected, we were able to ſet bounds to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the enemy, and, thank GOD! they are again aſſembling. I always conſidered a militia as the beſt troops in the world for a ſudden exertion, but they will not do for a long campaign. Howe, it is probable, will make an attempt on this city; ſhould he fail on this ſide the Delaware, he is ruined; if he ſucceeds, our cauſe is not ruined. He ſtakes all on his ſide againſt a part on ours; admitting he ſucceeds, the conſequence will be, that armies from both ends of the Continent will march to aſſiſt their ſuffering friends in the middle States: for he cannot go every where, it is impoſſible. I conſider Howe as the greateſt enemy the Tories have; he is bringing a war into their country, which, had it not been for him and partly for themſelves, they had been clear of. Should he now be expelled, I wiſh, with all the devotion of a Chriſtian, that the names of Whig and Tory may never more be mentioned; but ſhould the Tories give him encouragement to come, or aſſiſtance if he come, I as ſincerely wiſh that our next year's arms may expel them from the Continent, and the Congreſs appropriate their poſſeſſions to the relief of thoſe who have ſuffered in well doing. A ſingle ſucceſsful battle next year will ſettle the whole. Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica could carry on a two years war by the confiſcation of the property of diſaffected perſons, and be made happy by their expulſion. Say not that this is revenge call it rather the ſoft reſentment of a ſuffering people, who, having no object in view but the GOOD of ALL, have ſtaked their OWN ALL upon a ſeemingly doubtful event. Yet it is folly to argue againſt determined hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; eloquence may ſtrike the ear, and the language of ſorrow draw forth the tear of compaſſion, but nothing can reach the heart that is ſteeled with prejudice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:043115_0008_101CCC561B42E1C0"/>Quitting this claſs of men, I turn with the warm ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of a friend to thoſe who have nobly ſtood, and are yet determined to ſtand the matter out: I call not upon a few, but upon all; not on THIS State or THAT State, but on EVERY State; up and help us; lay your ſhoulders to the wheel; better have too much force than too little, when ſo great an object is at ſtake. Let it be told to the future world, that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could ſurvive, that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth to meet and to repulſe it. Say not, that thouſands are gone, turn out your tens of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands; throw not the burthen of the day upon Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but <hi>"ſhew your faith by your works,"</hi> that GOD may bleſs you. It matters not where you live or what rank of life you hold, the evil or the bleſſing will reach you all. The far and the near, the home counties and the back, the rich and the poor, ſhall ſuffer or rejoice alike. The heart that feels not now, is dead? The blood of his children ſhall curſe his cowardice, who ſhrinks back at a time when a little might have ſaved the whole, and made <hi>them</hi> happy. I love the man that can ſmile in trouble, that can gather ſtrength from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, and grow brave by reflection. 'Tis the buſineſs of little minds to ſhrink; but he whoſe heart is firm, and whoſe conſcience approves his conduct, will pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue his principles unto death. My own line of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is to myſelf as ſtrait and clear as a ray of light. Not all the treaſures of the world, ſo far as I believe, could have induced me to ſupport an offenſive war, for I think it murder; but if a thief break into my houſe, burn and deſtroy my property, and kill or threaten to kill me, or thoſe that are in it, and to <hi>"bind me in all caſes whatſoever,"</hi> to his abſolute will, am I to ſuffer it? What ſignifies it to me, whether he who does it, is a King of a common man; my countryman or not my countryman? whether it is done by an individual villain, or an army of them? If we reaſon to the root
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:043115_0009_101CCC6258CD0F60"/>
of things we ſhall find no difference; neither can any juſt cauſe be aſſigned why we ſhould puniſh in the one caſe, and pardon in the other. Let them call me rebel, and welcome, I feel no concern from it; but I ſhould ſuffer the miſery of devils, were I to make a whore of my ſoul by ſwearing allegiance to one, whoſe character is that of a ſottiſh, ſtupid, ſtubborn, worthleſs, brutiſh man. I conceive likewiſe a horrid idea in receiving mercy from a being, who at the laſt day ſhall be ſhriek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the rocks and mountains to cover him, and flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with terror from the orphan, the widow and the ſlain of America.</p>
            <p>There are Caſes which cannot be overdone by lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and this is one. There are perſons too who ſee not the full extent of the evil that threatens them: they ſolace themſelves with hopes that the enemy, if they ſucceed, will be merciful. It is the madneſs of folly to expect mercy from thoſe who have refuſed to do juſtice; and even mercy, where conqueſt is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, is only a trick of war: The cunning of the fox is as murderous as the violence of the wolf; and we ought to guard equally againſt both. Howe's firſt object is partly by threats and partly by promiſes, to terrify or ſeduce the people to deliver up their arms, and receive mercy. The miniſtry recommended the ſame plan to Gage, and this is what the Tories call making their peace; <hi>"a peace which paſſeth all underſtanding", in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed!</hi> A peace which would be the immediate fore run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a worſe ruin than any we have yet thought of. Ye men of Pennſylvania, do reaſon upon theſe things! Were the back counties to give up their arms, they would fall an eaſy prey to the Indians, who are all armed: This perhaps is what ſome Tories would not be ſorry for. Were the home counties to deliver up their arms, they would be expoſed to the reſentment of the back counties, who would then have it in their power to chaſtiſe their defection at pleaſure. And
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:043115_0010_101CCC59F975F600"/>
were any one ſtate to give up its arms, THAT State muſt be garriſoned by all Howe's army of Britons and Hoſſians to preſerve it from the anger of the reſt. Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual fear is a principal link in the chain of mutual love, and woe be to that State that breaks the compact. Howe is mercifully inviting you to barbarous deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and men muſt be either rogues or fools that will not ſee it. I dwell not upon the vapours of imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; I bring reaſon to your ears; and in language, as plain as A, B, C, hold up truth to your eyes.</p>
            <p>I thank GOD that I fear not, I ſee no real cauſe for fear. I know our ſituation well, and can ſee the way out of it. While our army was collected. Howe dare not riſk a battle, and it is no credit to him that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped from the White Plains, and waited a mean op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to ravage the defenceleſs Jerſies; but it is great credit to us, that, with an handful of men, we ſuſtained an orderly retreat for near an hundred miles, brought off our ammunition, all our field pieces, the greateſt part of our ſtores, and had four rivers to paſs. None can ſay that our retreat was precipitate, for we were near three weeks in performing it, that the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try might have time to come in. Twice we marched back to meet the enemy and remained out till dark. The ſign of fear was not ſeen in our camp, and had not ſome of the cowardly and diſaffected inhabitants ſpread falſe alarms through the country, the Jerſies had never been ravaged. Once more we are again collected and collecting, our new army at both ends of the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent is recruiting faſt, and we ſhall be able to open the next campaign with ſixty thouſand men, well armed and cloathed. This is our ſituation, and who will may know it. By perſeverance and fortitude we have the proſpect of a glorious iſſue; by cowardice and ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, the ſad choice of a variety of evils—a ravaged country—a depopulated city—habitations without ſafety, and ſlavery without hope—our homes turned
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:043115_0011_101CCC65211CDE20"/>
into barracks and baudy-houſes for Heſſians, and a future race to provide for whoſe fathers we ſhall doubt of. Look on this picture and weep over it!—and if there yet remains one thoughtleſs wretch who believes it not, let him ſuffer it unlamented.</p>
