            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>Old Divinity preferable to modern Novelty. In a LETTER, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>YOU doubtleſs remember, that in a late conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation you told me that you could not ſee but that Mr. Hopkins had proved that ſin is a created exiſtence, as really as any thing elſe which does exiſt: and that it muſt be ſo, unleſs we hold that a ſinner has a power to act independent upon God; which muſt be very abſurd to ſuppoſe.</p>
            <p>But, my friend, in that converſation I diſcovered that you were going ſo rapidly down the torrent, that friendſhip induces me to offer you ſome further thoughts on the ſubject: and I do it without delay, leſt before this arrives, you are plunged in the gulph of error paſt all recovery.</p>
            <p>Remember this, that when a propoſition is laid down, which is falſe in its own nature, it is not all the ſeeming proof in the world that can be offered, will ever make it true; and thoſe who undertake it, will have a hard and difficult taſk, and be found in a circumſtance ſomewhat ſimilar to a man I once read of who undertook ſo ſtrenuouſly to prove the heathen to be chriſtians, that in the iſſue it was ſaid, that he proved himſelf to be a heathen. A man
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:028849_0003_0FDE24F6136E9048"/>
who undertakes to prove one error to be a truth, will in truth prove himſelf to be guilty of two, if not ten, before he has done.</p>
            <p>But as I have not had opportunity to read Mr. Hopkins's ſyſtem, I don't pretend to know preciſely what he has wrote on the ſubject; but the general nature of what the advocates for this novelty ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, or can advance, I have heard often enough, and I think the whole may be confuted in the lump: being all but a lump of folly and nonſenſe, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that ſin is a thing created.</p>
            <p>I would not have you, my friend, take this letter to be a reply to Mr. Hopkins, any more than to others who imbibe the ſame ſentiment, as I find many do, who of late are ready to boaſt, and even to triumph, that they have ſuch a champion and bold advocate for the doctrine as they ſay Mr. Hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins is. Thoſe who have read him, and like his ſentiments well on this point, ſay that he don't keep hid, or act the cowardly part at all; as they own Mr. Weſt did, when ſome years ago he wrote on the ſubject.</p>
            <p>Doubtleſs you remember, Sir, that ſome years ago I publiſhed a little piece, entitled, <hi>Old Divinity preferable to Modern Novelty.</hi> And one of thoſe novelties which I then oppoſed, was this whimſical notion which aſſerts, that God creates Sin: And I ſuppoſed I ſaid enough then, to convince any one who will be governed by Scripture and reaſon, that ſin is not a created exiſtence. However, I did not ſay every thing then that might have been ſaid, to evince the folly of that idle whim; Therefore, I ſhall add a few things further now. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. If we allow that ſin is a created exiſtence, it
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:028849_0004_0FDE24F7DCF4E720"/>
overthrows the doctrine of Adam's fall; and it is never worth while for us to tell any more about it. His fall was no more than any other man's fall, who ſins; as we may ſee by and by.</p>
            <p>According to Old Divinity, there was real truth, and much propriety, in ſpeaking of Adam's fall as ſomething awfully great and dreadful: For Adam was made originally in the moral image of God, holy and upright, and put under a divine conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, holy, juſt and good, called the covenant of works; which ſecured life to him and his poſterity, upon conditions infinitely reaſonable and right; but by and according to which, one ſin forfeited every favour and bleſſing: And Adam being left to the freedom of his own will, fell from the ſtate wherein he was created by ſinning againſt God. And as Adam's holineſs, his original righteouſneſs, or the moral image of God, in which he was created, was the greateſt favour given him by creation; much greater than his own exiſtence would or could have been without it, it being abſolutely eſſential to his happineſs: Therefore, by eating the forbidden fruit, Adam forfeited this, as well as every other favour; and as God was pleaſed to take the forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure at his hands in this reſpect, ſo Adam died ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually; and his race are born deſtitute of original righteouſneſs in conſequence of that ſin: So there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by both Adam and his race became mortal; for in Adam all die, ſo by the diſobedience of one man judgment came upon all men to condemnation. O how ſad, awful and dreadful, was the fall of Adam indeed!</p>
            <p>But I find that the advocates for this novelty which aſſerts that God creates ſin, ſay that ſpiritual
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:028849_0004_0FDE24F7DCF4E720"/>
death was no part of the penalty with which Adam was threatened, in caſe he ſhould eat the forbidden fruit: But to anſwer wiſe ends and purpoſes, they ſay, God took away Adam's holineſs in a way of ſovereignty, and by his divine power created the radical ſum of all moral evil, in him, and by his poſitive agency produces all the evil volitions that Adam ever exerciſed, or any of his race, from that day to this, or ever will exerciſe to the end of the world: And without this, they ſay, that neither Adam, nor any of his race, could ever have ſinned at all. So that according to them, Adam did not fall by ſinning; for he was down before ever he was guilty of any tranſgreſſion. He did not fall from the eſtate wherein he was firſt created by ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt God: For according to them, God had took him out of the eſtate wherein he was firſt created, and put him into another ſtate infinitely worſe, before he ſinned. So that Adam was no more to blame for the loſs of his holineſs, than an innocent man is to blame for being robbed of a ſum of money. He met with a great calamity, but was guilty of no crime.</p>
            <p>When God created Adam holy, he exerciſed ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs: When God took away that holineſs, and created ſin in him, he exerciſed ſin. So that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this novelty, Adam met with a dreadful converſion;—was converted from being a very good man, to that of a very bad one; and this effected by the mighty power of God: For Adam was as paſſive in this change, as good converts are in their regeneration.</p>
            <p>According to genuine Calviniſm, a man is paſſive in his regeneration: That is, mankind in this fallen
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028849_0005_0FDE24FB2A9A9DC0"/>
ſtate, are conſidered as ſo entirely depraved and corrupt, there is nothing ſo good and virtuouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined in them by nature, as to concur with the divine ſpirit in producing that bleſſed change: But when the change is wrought by divine power and grace, the man becomes active in gracious and holy exerciſes. So I may ſay, upon their plan, when this dreadful change was a going to be wrought in Adam by divine power, to make a ſinner of him, there was nothing in his perfectly holy nature ſo wickedly inclined, as to concur in this awful work; but infinite power was above him, and too ſtrong for him, and when it had overcome every virtuous diſpoſition, comprized in the moral image of God, and created vicious ones in him in lieu thereof,— Adam becomes active in ſinful exerciſes, and ſo a voluntary ſinner.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I obſerve, that if we allow or aſſert that ſin is created, we muſt be led to deny the true definition of ſin, as given in our catechiſm, agreeable to the ſcriptures. Old Divinity aſſerts, "that ſin is any want of conformity unto, or tranſgreſſion of the law of God." Now it is evident, that the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Divines, which compiled the catechiſm, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the law of God to be ſo broad and ſpiritual, that it requires a right ſtate of heart, a right tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of mind, as well as a life rightly conducted. That as a rule, the law enjoins what mankind ſhould be, as well as what they ſhould do, viz. That we ſhould be holy both in heart and life: Therefore they ſay, that "ſin is any want of conformity unto this law,"—meaning in heart, ſpirit, temper and diſpoſition, as to the full extent of all that inward purity and holineſs which the law requires. And
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:028849_0005_0FDE24FB2A9A9DC0"/>
what can be more true than this? For if the law of God, as a good and juſt rule, requires of us poſitive holineſs, in full perfection: then any want of on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to this law is ſin. But the advocates for this novelty ſay, want of conformity to the law is <hi>not</hi> ſin: A mere deſtitution of holineſs is no ſin. For ſin, ſay they, conſiſts in poſitive oppoſition to God, and enmity againſt him. And they harp much upon this, and triumph in what they ſay, as ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it to be demonſtration, viz. <hi>That ſin is not a negative, but a poſitive: A negative is nothing; but ſin, certainly, is ſomething.</hi> And to prove that ſin is not a negative, they often bring ſimilitudes from the brutal and inanimate part of the creation, and ſay there is no holineſs in this thing, or that, and yet no ſin; becauſe there is no poſitive oppoſition to God.</p>
            <p>I have often had ſimilitudes of this nature brought to me, to prove that ſin is not a negative, viz. Let us ſuppoſe, here is a cheſt large and capacious enough to hold a good deal of treaſure; but there is no clothes in it—there is no ſilver nor gold in it —and there is no holineſs in it;—neither, ſay they, is there any ſin in it; becauſe there is no poſitive enmity to God. But as ſilly as the ſimilitude is, if they will prove that that cheſt always was, and now is, under moral obligations to be brim full of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and then prove, that for that cheſt to be wholly empty, or entirely deſtitute of any holineſs, is no ſin, the ſimilitude would be to their purpoſe. But how can it be, my friend, that rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and thoſe too who profeſs to be ſagacious and uncommonly diſcerning, will allow that we are under moral obligations to be perfectly holy, and
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:028849_0006_0FDE25010ADC8098"/>
then ſay entire deſtitution of it is no ſin? I ſay, how can this be? Why, my friend, I can tell you how it can be, and how it actually does come to paſs, viz. The advocates for this novelty having pre determined that there is no ſin but what is created: But they, with all their learning, wit and wiſdom, cannot make out that a want, or deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titution, is creation; and therefore they have been led to this neceſſity, to ſay, that want of conformity to the law of God is no ſin.</p>
            <p>I grant that there is poſitively ſuch a thing as ſin, and yet ſin is not, properly ſpeaking, a poſitive. There muſt be a poſitive, which is an original that is right, in order to furniſh us with a rule to know what is wrong. If there is nothing antecedently right, there can be nothing wrong; for wrong is the reverſe of right: Now right is a poſitive, an original; and wrong is the negative of that poſitive. Well, then, what is this poſitive that is right and truly original? <hi>It is holineſs.</hi> The holineſs of God is abſolute perfection in him, and the foundation of all moral obligation upon his, and all rational creatures to conform thereunto, as the only right and proper ſtandard: Therefore, when God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to be holy, he gives us the reaſon for it: Be ye holy, ſaith he, for I am holy. If God were not holy, we ſhould not be under any obligations to be holy: Neither ſhould we have had any rule or ſtandard of holineſs to conform unto. By poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive holineſs, creatures conform to the rule that is right: and the want of poſitive holineſs is a devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from that rule. Now, for a rational creature to be holy, is to be right; and not to be holy, is to be wrong; which is ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For a man to be right,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:028849_0006_0FDE25010ADC8098"/>
ſuppoſes he was made ſo by creation; but to be wrong, ſuppoſes he came ſo by degeneration. To be fully right, ſuppoſes holineſs in perfection: to be wrong, in any degree ſuppoſes a defection. And for any to aſſert, that degeneration and defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is creation, is the firſt born of non-ſenſe: And to ſay that degeneration and defection is no ſin, is no better.</p>
            <p>But to remark a little upon this plea they make, —that ſin is not a negative, becauſe a negative is nothing, and nothing is no ſin: for ſin is ſomething. Now, on ſuppoſition that ſuch a thing was poſſible, that man could, and really ſhould, do nothing for a limitted ſpace of time, yet the law of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring him poſitively to do ſomething the ſame ſpace, his doing nothing would be his crime, and not his excuſe: For if the unprofitable ſervant could plead he had done no harm, yet he muſt be condemned, for that he did no good; duty being ſomething poſitive.</p>
            <p>If one was to tell me, that he ſuppoſed that the negative of <hi>being</hi> was nothing,—non entity, or non-exiſtence—I ſhould ſuppoſe that he was ſincere. But when I hear men profeſſedly acquainted with language in divinity, ſay, that the negative of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive holineſs is nothing; that is no ſin—his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty looks ſuſpicious, though perhaps he may be ſincere being ſo ſanguine in the belief that there is no ſin but what God creates. As the poſitive and the negative are the reverſe of each other, there is no great difficulty in underſtanding what the negative is;—if we know what the poſitive is, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               </gap> is the reverſe of it.</p>

               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:028849_0007_0FDE250295779330"/>But ſeeing the advocates for this novelty, can't ſee any thing criminal in a negative, I will omit the word, and make uſe of ſome others that may anſwer as well: And I may ſay, that things in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral have their oppoſites; and we may learn much of the nature of things by their oppoſites. Light and darkneſs, life and death, holineſs and ſin, are the oppoſites of each other: So that if a man has no light, he is in darkneſs; if he has no life, he is dead; if he has no holineſs, he has ſin, or is a ſinner.</p>
            <p>Now let us ſuppoſe there is a man this hour who has natural life, the next hour he has loſt it entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The queſtion is, whether the man is dead? or whether there is ſome creation work to be wrought in order to kill him effectually. Or, we will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, here is a man who has ſpiritual life, or holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in perfection, as much as Adam had, when he was firſt created; but he ſoon looſes it entirely, let him looſe it how he will; either by forfeiture, or in a way of divine ſovereignty, God takes it from him, if he has loſt it: The queſtion is, whether he is not ſpiritually dead, in conſequence of that loſs without the addition of a creation to kill him in this ſenſe? And is not ſpiritual death a ſtate of ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Where, then, is there any room for creation to make a holy man become a ſinner?</p>
            <p>The caſe is very different on the other hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Let us ſuppoſe here is a man ſpiritually dead,—dead in treſpaſſes and ſin; how ſhall he be quickened and made alive ſpiritually? The ſcripture is plain,—<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> reſurrection power,—by creating power. And thoſe who are quickened with ſpiritual life, are ſaid to be
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:028849_0007_0FDE250295779330"/>
riſen with Chriſt, created anew, &amp;c. But now is a reſurrection power, and creating power, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be exerted, in order to bring theſe quickned ſouls back again into a ſtate of ſpiritual death? No, very far from that; for if it was not for the goſpel conſtitution, and the power of God engaged to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it, ſouls quickned with ſpiritual life, would fall back again, of their own accord, into a ſtate of ſpiritual death. And to prevent this from actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly being the caſe with ſaints, God, who has began the good work of grace in their hearts, carries it on, and they are kept by the power of God, thro' faith, unto ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Now if Adam, being left to the freedom of his own will, fell into a ſtate of ſpiritual death, (and the ſaints who are quickned with ſpiritual life would fall into a ſtate of ſpiritual death alſo, if they were not, by the power of God, kept from it),—how fooliſh muſt the aſſertion be, that men can't ſin, but by the exertion of creating power producing of it? When divine power and grace muſt conſtantly be engaged to prevent it.</p>
            <p>If the advocates for this novelty will prove that there was and is a wicked Deity who exiſted of a neceſſity of nature from all eternity, and that ſin is eſſential to his very nature, or eſſence, and that all ſin in creatures, is created by him, or that he is the great Efficient poſitively producing of it, then I will own that ſin is as truely a poſitive and an original as holineſs is.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If we allow, or aſſert, that God produces ſin by his poſitive agency, or that he creates it; then I remark, that ſin is the gift of God to them who
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:028849_0008_0FDE2503FA849B28"/>
have it. 'As God gave me my exiſtence by creation, the powers and faculties of my ſoul and body, which I am to be thankful for, and improve to his honour and glory: ſo if God does create ſin in me, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that I may be furniſh'd with ability to exerciſe it, then it is as truely the gift of God as my exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is, or any other thing he gives by creation.' And this is ſo true and undeniable, that there is no getting from it. Let the advocates for this novelty wrangle and twiſt ever ſo much, they muſt come to it at laſt, and own that ſin is as much the gift of God to them that have it, as faith is, or any other ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace, to thoſe who have them. Although I will freely concede if that will oblige them any, that ſin is not ſo good a gift as ſome other of the gifts of God are, yet as truely his gift.</p>
            <p>Now I wiſh theſe gentlemen who aſſert that God creates ſin, would be ſo kind as to tell me whether I ought to be thankful to God for this gift, and pray to God for ſtrength to improve it well, that when he has given me one talent of it I may ſo improve it, as to gain five more. And as you, my friend, ſeemed to be almoſt proſelyted to the ſentiment, I would aſk you what you think an holy ſoul in the exerciſe of grace, who feels diſpoſed to give God thanks for all his gifts; I ſay, what do you think he will do, when in his thankſgiving he comes to mention the gift of ſin? wont he heſitate and bog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle here, or what will he do?—Methinks he will expreſs himſelf in language like this following, viz. <q>O Lord God Almighty, I feel myſelf overwhelm'd in debt to thee, for thy manifold favours, and have a diſpoſition, by thy grace, to give thanks to thy great name for all thy gifts of nature, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:028849_0008_0FDE2503FA849B28"/>
and grace. I give thanks to thee, O my God, for the gift of my exiſtence, that thou haſt given me a rational ſoul, with all its noble pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and faculties. I give thanks to thee for my bodily ſtructure, with limbs and members ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and entire. I give thanks to thee, O God, for the creatures thou haſt made for my uſe and comfort. I give thanks to thee, O Father of all mercies, and God of all grace, for the gift of thy Son to become my Saviour and Redeemer. I give thanks to thee, O God, for the gift of thy ſpirit, to apply the great ſalvation to my ſoul, which Chriſt has purchaſed. I thank thee for the gift of regenerating grace, for the gift of faith, for the gift of repentance and pardon; yea, O Lord, I give thanks to thee for the gift of eternal life, which thou haſt promiſed in thy word, to all them that believe. O Lord, every good and perfect gift comes from thee, and they are more than I can enumerate. What ſhall I render to the Lord for all his benefits? But, O Lord, there are ſome who profeſs to be teachers in thy name, who tell me that thou doſt give ſin to the children of men by thy creating power; muſt I be thankful to thee for this gift? O no, the holy fervours of my ſoul, under the influence of thy grace, will not admit of it; what ſhall I do, then, in this ſtrait? ſhall I be unthankful to thee for any of thy gifts? this I would not be; but I can't be thankful for the gift of ſin, but muſt pray that God will never curſe me with ſuch a gift. O Lord, be not angry with me, if I pray to thee in the words of Daniel to Belſhazar, let thy gifts, of this nature, be to thyſelf, and give thy
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:028849_0009_0FDE250920D906F0"/>
rewards to another. O no, I cannot pray ſo, for I love my neighbour as myſelf; and by thy grace prevailing in my heart; I love my enemies. Therefore, I cannot pray that God will beſtow that devil like gift of ſin on the worſt enemy I have in the world.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But how do you think, my friend, that a ſinner, who loves his ſin, and determines to purſue the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of it, as his chief happineſs, all the days of his life; I ſay, how do you think ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> would pray, if he ſhould ſpeak out the language of his heart, and in the full belief of this novelty that God does create ſin?—I think we may naturally ſuppoſe that the language of his heart, fram'd into words, would be as follows: <q>O Lord God Almighty, as I am told by my teacher, and I firmly believe his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, that in thy ſovereigty thou waſt pleaſed to take away the holineſs originally given to Adam, and didſt create ſin in him, in lieu thereof, and by thy poſitive agency didſt produce every evil volition in Adam he ever had, and likewiſe doth the ſame in me, and in all Adam's race, and will continue to do ſo as long as the children of men exerciſe any ſin; ſo that in conſequence of my being deprav'd and corrupted, by the ſin which thou haſt created in me, and doſt daily produce by thy poſitive agency, I delight in wickedneſs exceedingly. I roll ſin as a ſweet morſel under my tongue, and refuſe to let it go. I would not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change the pleaſures of ſin, for the rivers of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which flow at God's right hand forevermore. And if I am not truely thankful to thee, O God, for all thy gifts; yet this darling gift, ſin, glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens me to the heart. And although, by thy
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:028849_0009_0FDE250920D906F0"/>
creating power, thou haſt form'd me for the work and buſineſs of ſin, and haſt given me a general propenſity that way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet of myſelf I am ſo weak and feeble, as to works of wickedneſs, that I can't get ſo much as one evil volition excited by all that I can do; no, nor by all the help the devil can afford me.—Therefore, as ſin is my delightful element, I ſincerely pray that God will conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to afford me help herein, and grant ſuch meaſures of his almighty agency, which will be effectual to produce evil violitions, in thick ſucceſſion, in me, that I may be very fruitful in ways of ſin, and abound in the works of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and herein equal any ſervant of the devil on earth. But, O Lord, if in thy divine ſover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eignty thou art pleaſed to withhold thoſe influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of thine, which are abſolutely neceſſary to produce ſin, and I remain in a great meaſure bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren as to fruits of wickedneſs; I muſt ſubmit to the ſad mortification of remaining a little, poor dwarf of a ſinner.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. I remark upon this doctrine, which aſſerts, God doth create ſin, or produce it by his poſitive agency, that no man ever did, will, or can exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe true genuine repentance while he has the full belief of this doctrine plain in his view, and realized before him.</p>
            <p>In true repentance, a man acquits God wholly from blame, and takes freely the whole blame to himſelf; and if God is ſo good, kind, and gracious as to pardon him, he don't know how to pardon himſelf; his ſins appear ſo unreaſonable, and his
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:028849_0010_0FDE250A00820140"/>
crimes ſo aggravated and heinous. But if I believe God created my ſin in me, and produced it by his poſitive agency, and thereby made me voluntary in the exerciſe of ſin; I cannot take the whole blame to myſelf, let my temper of mind, or diſpoſition, be ever ſo good and holy. As on the other hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when God creates good diſpoſitions, and produces gracious and holy tempers in the ſaints, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by makes them voluntary in good and virtuous exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, they don't take the whole praiſe of their own voluntary exerciſes to themſelves; for they know of right, the principal and chief praiſe belongs to the Great Efficient, who produced them. "Not unto us, not unto us, but to thy name, O Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be the glory," is their united language. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if a man really believes, that by the creating power of God, exerted upon him, ſin is produced and he thereby is made a volunteer in the exerciſe of it, he muſt counteract his reaſon, bribe his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and turn fool, in order to take the whole blame to himſelf.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If we allow, and maintain, that God creates ſin, I remark, that it has a natural tendency to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice mankind againſt ſome very important doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of the Bible, more than otherwiſe they would be. If you tell ſinners of the riſing generation, and in ſome places more eſpecially, that they muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the depravity of human nature in this fallen ſtate, that they lie wholly at the mercy of God, and that he has a ſovereign right to have mercy on whom he will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Tell them of the doctrine of ſpecial grace, juſtification by faith, the perſeverance of the ſaints, and ſuch like: Then they will immediately
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:028849_0010_0FDE250A00820140"/>
conclude that they conſent to theſe things, they muſt go further, and believe, that God does create ſin; becauſe that now-a days there are ſo many that teach the one, teach the other alſo. But thirty or forty years ago there was no ſuch doctrine held in our country, as all know who lived in that day, and paid any proper attention to divinity. All our Calviniſtic divines rejected the idea with abhorrence, that God created ſin; as is well known, from the firſt ſettling of this country, down to Preſident Edwards and Dr. Bellamy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which two late and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted divines, bore an ample teſtimony againſt this vile and pernicious novelty ſo much imbibed of late; which in the cloſe of this letter I ſhall cite their own words to ſhew.</p>
            <p>But of late, that there are many who have art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully tried to connect this novelty with the doctrines of grace, cannot be denied, and have prejudiced people againſt the truth abundantly. The riſing generation often ſay,— <q>What! will God forbid ſin, and then create it himſelf? will he produce it in men by his own poſitive agency, and then damn them for it? If you call this one of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of grace we will quit them; we don't think that there is any thing worſe, if ſo bad, in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minianiſm, Deiſm, nor Univerſaliſm.</q> And hence many fly to thoſe ſectaries for refuge, to ſhun this vile and abominable doctrine. And the advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates for this novelty are eventually driving the country faſt into Deiſm, and Univerſaliſm.</p>
            <p n="6">6. If we allow that God creates ſin, and produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces it by his own poſitive agency: then I remark, that Moſes, and Paul, and other writers of the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:028849_0011_0FDE250B8CBDE2F8"/>
ſcriptures, have manifeſtly ſlandered the devil, by laying that to his charge that he never was guilty of: for if God created ſin our firſt parents, and in their whole ace, and produces, by his poſitive agency, all the evil volitions and exerciſes they ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er have, (as this novelty aſſerts,) then mankind would have ſinned, and continue to ſin, juſt as they did, and do, if there had been no devil in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe. And what is it, then, laid to the devil for, that he is the cauſe of mens ſinning?</p>
            <p>When Moſes undertook to give us an hiſtorical account of the ſin of our firſt parents, in eating the forbidden fruit, he don't ſo much as hint, that God created their ſin, or produced it by his own poſitive agency. But by divine permiſſion, the devil, by ſubtilty and craft, deceit and lies, really deceived Eve, and effected the fall of our firſt parents. And Paul ſays, "I fear leſt by any means, that as the ſerpent beguiled Eve thro' his ſubtilty, ſo your minds ſhould be corrupted,' &amp;c. And another writer of ſcripture ſays, after the ſop ſatan entered into Judas, and then he was ready, and ſought op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to betray his Lord. And Peter ſays to Ananias, "why hath ſatan filled thine heart to lie unto the Holy Ghoſt?"</p>
            <p>Now, why ſhould there be ſuch a combination among the inſpired writers, to lay this heavy charge upon the devil, as being guilty of influencing and cauſing men to ſin, if God creates and produces it himſelf?—For my part, I don't think it is right to belie and ſlander the devil, becauſe he is a bad crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: no, give the devil his due: and if he has been ſlandered and charged wrongfully, let him
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:028849_0011_0FDE250B8CBDE2F8"/>
have juſtice done him. And altho' the advocates for this novelty have virtually, and for ſubſtance, acquitted the devil of this charge, by laying it upon God: yet if their doctrine be true, they ought to ſee to it that they procure, in the devil's behalf, a more explicit, public, and honourable acquitance than they have yet given him.</p>
            <p n="7">7. If we allow, and maintain, that God creates ſin then I remark, that it muſt give ſuch an idea of the character of the ever bleſſed God, that is too ſhocking to admit.</p>
            <p>Some have ſuppoſed, that if God had left Adam in a ſtate of pure nature, when he was firſt created, and had not put him under any covenant or conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution at all, if he had continued a thouſand years in perfect obedience, as he owed all that obedience to God, he could not thereby have brought God into debt to him: ſo they ſuppoſe God might have annihilated him after a thouſand years of perfect ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and happineſs, and have done Adam no injuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice at all. And this point I don't mean to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovert: but we know that according to ſcripture, Adam was not thus left. God was pleaſed to put him under a divine conſtitution, called the covenant of works, the tenor of which was, <hi>do and live, diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey and die.</hi> Now in theſe circumſtances, if God had inflicted the calamity of natural death upon Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, while he continued obedient, it would have been a violation of the conſtitution on God's part; therefore he infinitely abhorred to do ſuch a thing. How then could God inflict upon Adam a calamity a thouſand times greater than meerly natural death! which he really did if he took away his original
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:028849_0012_0FDE250D02622350"/>
righteouſneſs, and created ſin in him prior to his eating the forbidden fruit? this would have been inflicting death upon his ſoul a dreadful calamity, when he was guilty of no crime.</p>
            <p>Adam's holineſs was the true life of his ſoul, and abſolutely eſſential to his happineſs. Therefore, to ſuppoſe that God did thus rob, plunder, and I may ſay, murder the ſoul of innocent Adam, is too ſhocking to admit. Did God create Adam holy, and enjoin it upon him to keep, maintain, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe it upon the pain of eternal death? And then in a way of divine prerogative and ſovereignty, take it away from him, and create and produce ſin in him, and thereby cauſe him to become a voluntary ſinner, and then plead a right in juſtice to ſend him to hell, for the very ſin that he himſelf produced? who can poſſibly believe this, that is not in a delirium?—If we could ſee a conduct, in any one inſtance, among the children of men, any thing ſimilar hereunto, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body's indignation would be excited. As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and to come as near to it as we can:—Let us ſuppoſe an earthly King comes to his throne, and is received by all his ſubjects with acclamations of joy, and entire loyalty in their hearts; and when he is eſtabliſhed in his kingdom he promulgates his good and wholeſome laws, with a promiſe, that if his ſubjects will continue in their loyalty and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, he will protect them in the enjoyment of all their reaſonable liberties and privileges; but if any of them turn rebels and break his laws, they ſhall be puniſhed with death. To this, all his ſubjects heartily ſay, amen. And thus they live in mutual peace and happineſs, and a proſpect of always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:028849_0012_0FDE250D02622350"/>But now, let us ſuppoſe, (for here we can ſpeak only by way of ſuppoſition, for the thing in reality can't be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>)—but I ſay, let us ſuppoſe that this King have an eaſy acceſs to the hearts of his ſubjects, and by the arm of his power takes away the ſpirit of loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty from a number of his ſubjects, and creates, and produces in them a ſpirit of rebellion, and thereby cauſes them to be voluntary in their rebellion; which as ſoon as ever it appears, the king declares they ſhall be puniſhed with death, and brings them upon trial, rebellion is proved againſt them, and the ſentence of death is paſt upon them.</p>
            <p>But here we will further ſuppoſe, that one in the capacity of an attorney undertakes to plead for theſe condemned rebels, and addreſſes himſelf to the king in the following manner:—"May it pleaſe your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, to hear me a few words in the behalf of theſe condemned rebels, as you know that I am acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the whole affair. Theſe men were once loyal ſubjects, and cordial in their obedience, and would ever have remained ſo if you had let them alone, and ſuffer'd them to have acted out their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive diſpoſition: but you know that you took away from them that ſpirit of loyalty by the arm of your power, and created in them that ſpirit of rebellion they now have, and you poſitively excited and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced every exerciſe of it they ever had; and ſeeing this is undeniably the caſe, I think you ought to mitigate their puniſhment, or excuſe them entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly."—No, ſays the king: 'tis no matter how they came by their rebellious diſpoſitions, rebellion in its own nature, merits death, and hang'd they ſhall be;—and puts the ſentence into execution.—Now
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:028849_0013_0FDE25125D689C38"/>
in this ſuppoſed caſe, every body would cry out againſt this king, and condemn him for a wicked ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and ſubtile knave, that deſerved hanging more than any of his rebellious ſubjects. And yet this blaſphemous novelty charges all this upon God. I wonder its advocates are not aſhamed to appear in ſuch a cauſe, which might well make the devil bluſh to eſpouſe perſonally; and ſo he hides behind the curtain, and ſets them to do the work for him.</p>
            <p n="8">8. If we allow that God creates ſin, or produces it by his poſitive agency, then I remark, that a chriſtian has got another, greater, harder, and more difficult piece of work to do than ever was known before. Chriſtians always knew that they had got to ſtrive and watch againſt ſin, and all temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations leading to it, and hence to maintain a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant warfare againſt the world, the fleſh, and the devil.— The world, with its alluring charms, will enſnare and draw the chriſtian into ſin, if he is not watchful and very much on his guard.</p>
            <p>The fleſh, that is, corrupt nature, the unſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied part of even regenerate men,—is a dangerous enemy; and the chriſtian muſt be active by the grace of God to crucify the fleſh with the affections and luſts, and thro' the ſpirit to mortify the deeds of the body; or by this enemy he will be drawn into ſin.—The devil, the avowed adverſary of mankind in general, and of true chriſtians in particular, is going about as a roaring lion, ſeeking whom he may devour: and the chriſtian ſoul is called to reſiſt this adverſary, ſtedfaſt in the faith; and for his encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, the Apoſtle tells him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> "Reſiſt the devil and he ſhall flee from thee, and ſatan ſhall be bruiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:028849_0013_0FDE25125D689C38"/>
under your feet ſhortly."—So that the chriſtian has a proſpect of getting the victory over theſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent enemies, the world, the fleſh, and the devil, but, O! what will the poor chriſtian do, when he has Infinite Power to reſiſt, and war againſt! when God comes to create ſin in him, and with his almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty agency determines to produce it, and thereby cauſe the chriſtian to give his conſent to ſin. O ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity indeed! prior to the exertion of this creating power, the chriſtian had acted in character; ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely hated all ſin, and longed to be entirely deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from it. Yea, he had exerted himſelf man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ully, and had got conſiderable victory over his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual enemies, the world, the fleſh, and the devil. And he meant and intended, prayed, and hoped, to keep the conqueſt he had gained, and to gain more and more daily. But, O! alas! for the poor chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian; what a dreadful diſappointment did he meet with, when the creating power of God was exerted, and the poſitive agency of the Moſt High, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a change in the bias and diſpoſition of his ſoul to ſuch a degree, that it was not all the habits of grace, or principles of love to God and holineſs, which were to a good degree prevalent but a little before, that could now prevent the chriſtian from yielding and conſenting to that which is ſin! And when the chriſtian ſoul comes to reflect on what he has done, he is ready to wring his hands in deſpair, and ſay, O, alas! I never can get victory over ſin, ſo long as God keeps creating of it in me. I had, and long have had, courage to war againſt all the powers of hell; but to ſtrive againſt, and reſiſt the creating power of God, will be entirely fruitleſs, if not high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſumptuous.</p>

The laſt remark I ſhall make upon this novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which aſſerts that God creates ſin, is, that if ſome of the warmeſt advocates for it, who are anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious to have it ſpread, and be univerſally received, will contrive matters ſo as to ſend, from among themſelves, ſome miſſionaries down to the dark re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions and preach this novelty there to the fallen An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: and if they ſhould happen to be credited, and their doctrine be believed, I doubt not but my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture will prove to be a truth, viz. That it would make the devils rejoice, and ſet them all a praying, if not praiſing God, with the ſame tempers and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliſh diſpoſitions they now have; it would ſuit them ſo well to the very heart.</p>
            <p>But my friend, you will ſay, that now I am ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant: What! will the devils pray? why yes, when they can have a proſpect of anſwering their own ends by it. We read that the devils pray'd, or beſought Chriſt that he would ſuffer them to enter into the herd of ſwine, that they might drive them head-long into the ſea, and thereby prejudice the whole country againſt Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But if you ſcruple the truth of my conjecture, I will point out to you an inſtance wherein we may naturally ſuppoſe the devils will be ready to pray to God, if they can be made to believe that God cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates ſin, or produces it by his poſitive agency. You know, ſir, that tis the conſtant work and buſineſs of the devils, to endeavour to tempt mankind to ſin, in order to bring them down to deſtruction.—There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when they have laid their train of temptations before men, to induce one to commit murder, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to commit adultery, &amp; others to lie, ſteal, roo, &amp;c. and as the devils are very deſirous of ſucceſs;
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:028849_0014_0FDE2513CB9CA800"/>
and believing that if God don't create ſin in theſe men in this very juncture, and produce evil voli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in them by his poſitive agency, ſo that they will voluntarily comply with their temptations; all their attempts will prove abortive, and their labour will be but in vain. Therefore we may naturally ſuppoſe, that in the belief of this novelty, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils will pray in language like this following, viz.— <q>O Lord God of infinite knowledge and power, thou ſeeſt what a train of temptations we have laid before theſe men, to induce them to commit the ſeveral abominations we wiſh and deſire they might; and thou, O Lord God of infinite power, art able to give us ſucceſs, and all our labour will be loſt and in vain if thou doſt not: as when Chriſt's miniſters preach the Goſpel, and do their utmoſt endeavour to bring ſinners to repentance and holy exerciſes, all their labour will be loſt and in vain, unleſs thy divine power does attend, and thou, by thy poſitive agency, doſt produce holy tempers, diſpoſitions and exerciſes: even Paul may plant, and Apollos water to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, unleſs God will pleaſe to give the increaſe. And ſo, O Lord, it is with us weak and feeble devils; we need thy help and aſſiſtance, as much as Chriſt's miniſters do; and unleſs thou wilt be pleaſed to afford it, ſatan may plant, and belze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub himſelf may water in vain, for it is thou, O Lord, only, who art able to give the increaſe. And altho' we know thou art determined to build up the kingdom of Chriſt in the world, yet thou haſt power enough to build up our kingdom too, and if they are in direct oppoſition the one from the other, no matter for that, for the ſcriptures ſay, thou canſt do every thing. Now, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:028849_0015_0FDE25155BF23878"/>
O Lord God Almighty, be pleaſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert thy power, and create ſin in theſe men ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally; and by thy poſitive agency, cauſe them to comply with our temptations, and hell itſelf will rejoice with our ſort of malicious joy, if we don't in a formal manner keep a day of thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving. And what, O Lord, has embolden'd and encourag'd us thus to pray unto thee, in hopes of ſucceſs, is a novelty lately imbibed in hell, which teaches us that God does in reality create ſin, and produce it by his poſitive agency. This is good news for us: we expect now, our work will be facilitated much; for when a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty auxiliary from heaven will aſſiſt hell, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Power engage on our ſide, we may expect every thing. We need but put the point of the nail where we wiſh to have it enter, and one blow ſtruck by Almighty Power will drive it up to the head.—But, O, alas! while we are thus ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, our faith in this novelty begins to ſtagger, conſidering the riſe of it; for we muſt own that it was invented and propagated by men on earth, which we ourſelves deceived; and if we ourſelves ſhould be deceived by it, the deception would be doubly develiſh.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But in as much as the advocates for this novelty pretend in general to have a great veneration for the writings of preſident Edwards and Dr Bella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; I ſhall, (as I ſaid,) cite a few paſſages from their works, which will ſhew what they thought of this novelty.</p>
            <p>Preſident Edwards ſays, <q>It was meet, if ſin did come into exiſtence, and appear in the world, it ſhould ariſe from the imperfection which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:028849_0015_0FDE25155BF23878"/>
belongs to a creature, as ſuch, and ſhould appear ſo to do, that it might appear not to be from God as the Efficient."—And he further ſays, If ſin had not aroſe from the imperfection of the creature, it would not have been ſo viſible that it did not ariſe from God as the poſitive cauſe.</q> —(His Book on the Freedom of the Will, page 377, London Edition.)</p>
            <p>Again he ſays, <q>That there is a great difference between the ſun's being the cauſe of the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeneſs and warmth of the atmoſphere, and brightneſs of gold and diamonds by its preſence and poſitive influence; and tis being the occaſion of darkneſs and froſt, in the night, by its motion, whereby it deſcends below the horizon. The motion of the ſun is the occaſion of the latter kind of events, but it is not the proper cauſe, efficient or producer of them. No more is any action of the Divine Being the cauſe of the evil of mens wills. Sin is not the fruit of any agency or influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Moſt High.</q>—(The ſame Book page 363, 364.)</p>
            <p>From theſe paſſages I remark three things:</p>
            <p n="1">1 That Mr. Edwards ſuppoſed, that ſin did ariſe from the creature; that God was not the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, or producer of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He ſuppoſed, that it was a matter of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that this ſhould appear to be the caſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That it was a ſettled point with him that in fact this doth appear to be the caſe.—And how it ever came to enter into the heart or head of any man, to think otherwiſe, is very ſtrange, in one view of the caſe; but not ſo ſtrange, when we conſider that
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:028849_0016_0FDE2516BA437760"/>
fondneſs for novelty, and a pleaſing conceit of knowing more than ever was known, ſtimulates ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the preſent day, who, in their own view, <hi>leap at ſtars, but faſten in the mud.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have ſeen numbers, of but ordinary abilities, and of but ſhort opportunities for the ſtudy of divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, who yet will not heſitate to ſay, without a bluſh, they know more then Preſident Edwards did; but to attone for their arrogance, they will give him credit in part. They will allow that Mr. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards was eminent in his day, but it is now a day of greater light: And beſide, ſay they, we that come after him, have the benefit of his writings, that when we come to ſtand upon his ſhoulders, no wonder that we can ſee further than he did. But I rather ſuſpect the truth of the caſe lies here; Mr. Edwards was a tall man, and when they preſum'd to clamber up upon his ſhoulders, it carried them ſo much out of ther proper ſphere, and higher than their capacities were able to bear, that it cauſed their heads to ſwim, and their brains to turn, till they were ſtruck with a fit of delirium, and never have come out of it ſince. And 'tis no uncommon thing, for people in a delirium, to take a fancy that they know every thing.</p>
            <p>I proceed now to cite a paſſage from Dr. Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamy's writings upon this point. He is ſpeaking of us as we are now, fallen creatures, and not of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am as he was originally made. And he ſays, <q>God only creates the naked eſſence of our ſouls, our natural faculties; a power to <hi>think</hi> and will, and to love and hate; and the evil bent of our hearts is not of his making, but is the ſpontaneous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity of our own wills: For we being born de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:028849_0016_0FDE2516BA437760"/>
of the divine image, ignorant of God, and inſenſible of his infinite glory, do of our own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord turn to ourſelves, and to things of time and ſenſe, &amp; to anything that ſuits a graceleſs heart, &amp; there all our affections center; from whence we natively become averſe to God, and to all that is ſpiritually good, and inclined to all ſin. So that the poſitive corruption of our nature, is not any thing created by God.</q>—(True Religion deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neated, page 171).</p>
            <p>But after all that has been ſaid, I ſuppoſe that there are ſome that will neither be reaſon'd, nor ridicul'd out of their errors; but like thoſe ſpoken of by the Prophet, "who hold faſt deceit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to let it go." And not only ſo, but I expect they will put on a cloak of Gravity, and pretend that I have been guilty of a great deal of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in not treating ſuch a ſubject with more ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.—To which I anſwer,—</p>
            <p n="1">1. That I believe there are more ſerious and weighty arguments in the foregoing performance, than the advocates for this novelty deſire to ſee, or know what to do with.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When the prophet Elijah once had a call to have concern with matters and things, (1 Kings 18.27.) which were really ridiculous, he treated them in ſuch a manner, as was calculated to make their ridiculouſneſs appear more glaring; altho' ſome might be ready to charge him with levity. And I verily believe this novelty, which charges God with creating ſin, is as ridiculous as any perſon or thing the prophet Elijah had to deal with. And with an honeſt mind I have attempted to make it appear.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But if the advocates for this novelty, ſtill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt that I have been very wicked in the manner of
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:028849_0017_0FDE251BE26442A0"/>
handling this ſubject,—I have this to tell them, viz. That if their doctrine be true, I have not, neither in matter nor manner, committed a whit more ſin than God created in me, or produced by his poſitive agency. And I never will blame any man who commits no more ſin than what God creates in him: If he is guilty of no other crimes, I think he is very excuſable.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall tire your patience, my friend; and therefore ſhall add no more than this one remark, viz. That execrable monſter William Beadle, who murdered his family and himſelf, with great delib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration, at Weathersfield, a few years ago, firmly believed that he was poſitively influenced by God to do all that: For he had it in contemplation three years, and got fully eſtabliſhed that he was influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by God to do it, before, it ſeems, he dare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake it; as appears by his own private writings, made public in the ſermon preached at the funeral of his murdered family.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, my friend, that he had renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the chriſtian religion, and profeſſed to be a Deiſt: 'Tis true, he did ſo; and I think it is as true, that that it is not fitting that any man ſhould profeſs to believe that God, by his poſitive agency, does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence men to ſin; until that they have firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the chriſtian religion as Beadle did.</p>
            <p>But, my friend, before you fully adopt this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty, I wiſh you to anſwer one queſtion that I ſhall now propoſe, viz. That if God does create ſin, and is the great efficient of it; then, when Chriſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dues it in his redeemed people, what truth or ſenſe can there be in ſaying he deſtroys the works of the devil,—when it is manifeſt, that it is one branch of God's workmanſhip that he deſtroys?</p>
