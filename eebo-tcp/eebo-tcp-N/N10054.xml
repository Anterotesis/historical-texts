            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>YOUR particular requeſt, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant demand of the public, have at length inclined me to conſent to the printing of this ſermon; ſeeing that the armed force is now removed, which, by the ſtrange uſe, that was lately made of it, put us all without diſtinction in <note n="*" place="bottom">By deſcription, the face of things in Blackman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet, on the 10th of <hi>May</hi> in the Afternoon, was like that of a town taken by a foreign enemy, and expecting military execution: The Shops were all ſhut up, the people aſſaulted as they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring their own houſes, driven about like ſheep, and made the ſport of ſuch infamous wretches as the common ſoldiers, who had the inſolence to preſent their pieces at thoſe who from their up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per chambers looked out into the ſtreet. How would the Londoners have liked ſuch treatment? And yet it is evident, that the Townſmen and houſe-keepers of Blackman-ſtreet were never in any riot, or had any more concern with the people in <hi>St. George</hi>'s <hi>Fields,</hi> than the citizens and houſe-keepers in <hi>Cheapſide.</hi> As for the great road and <hi>Newington</hi> cauſeway, it was ſo dangerous, that beſide the death of the people in and near the Hay-market, the balls penetrated the very ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the windows at a great diſtance from the place of action in the fields. Ought not procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to have been made for the people to have left their houſes? and notice given in the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent villages, to have prevented the inhabitants from coming abroad, who knew nothing of the miſchief that was intended?</note> danger of our lives. I do not find, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012772_0004_0F8A9345A37B1970"/>
as yet, any among the great, ſo ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of our caſe, as to be willing to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronize it publicly, and procure us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs; and therefore, as you are ſo deeply and tenderly intereſted in the SUBJECT, the DEDICATION, I think, of right belongs to you. Not that I intend from hence, after the manner of DEDICATORS, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to your <hi>paſſions</hi>; or make your <hi>wounds bleed afreſh,</hi> by dwelling upon your misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes; but rather to take occaſion, from ſuch an opportunity offered, to <hi>conſole,</hi> and <hi>fortify</hi> you in bearing up under an <hi>evil,</hi> which, with <hi>reſpect to yourſelf,</hi> is now paſt a remedy; and to teach you an <hi>acquieſcence</hi> under the diſpenſations of PROVIDENCE; not upon the tyrannic, and inhuman hypotheſis—"<hi>That whatever is, is right,</hi>" but from a better and wiſer <hi>notion</hi>—That whatever is now <hi>wrong,</hi> will one time or other be ſet to <hi>rights.</hi> I do not know,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012772_0005_0F8A93469C1B2120"/>
whether my <hi>religion</hi> be ſuited to the taſte of theſe <hi>enthuſiaſtic</hi> times; but it is a religion between God and myſelf, and a religion likely to laſt longer than any of modern invention. I believe in God, and ſee the diſorders now ſubſiſting in the world; but I do not charge theſe diſorders upon HIM or his PROVIDENCE.—"You have loſt an only Son,"—that you muſt have done by the courſe of nature.—But you will ſay,— "<hi>It was by the hands of Ruffians,</hi> pretending authority to ſlay the <hi>innocent.</hi>"—No doubt theſe are calamities, as heavy, as can be well imagined, and moſt grievouſly ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to human nature—but enlarge your view a little, and conſider the preſent ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of things, in <hi>conjunction</hi> with <hi>futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> and you may find occaſion yet to <hi>poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs your ſoul in patience.</hi> It happens in the courſe of this world, that very good men meet with very unfavourable and injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous treatment, and very bad men on the contrary with much of earthly happineſs. Of this our <hi>fellow-creatures,</hi> being in great meaſure the inſtruments, it really could not be expected, as far as they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, that things ſhould proceed very regular, and even; ſince men were conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted <hi>free</hi> creatures, and at liberty to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have as the <hi>law</hi> of God requires; or to
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012772_0006_0F8A9346D67469C0"/>
violate it, if through malignancy of heart they chooſe it.</p>
            <p>BUT then you are to conſider, with all this, that men are <hi>accountable</hi> for their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, "<hi>that God judges the earth;</hi>" that is, he diſcerns between the <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil</hi> tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted in it, and determines the former to be worthy of a <hi>reward,</hi> and the latter to deſerve <hi>puniſhment.</hi> And thence you are to infer, that as <hi>rewards</hi> and <hi>puniſhments</hi> in this life are not always connected immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately with the reſpective <hi>obedience</hi> or <hi>diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> of men, that there muſt be a <hi>future</hi> ſtate; which aſſures you of the <hi>immortality of your own ſoul;</hi> and that in conſequence of a life of innocence and virtue here, you will be a joyful ſpectator to all eternity, of the exact and punctual diſpenſations of God's <hi>never-failing</hi> and <hi>unerring</hi> JUSTICE.</p>

            <p>THE laws of God, as delivered to us by his ſervant <hi>Moſes,</hi> have been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed into three ſorts, or kinds; and paſs under the ſeveral denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of eccleſiaſtical, moral and civil.</p>
            <p>The eccleſiaſtical laws have reſpect only to matters in religion, deſcribing the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and attributes of God, and the general ſervice, which he challenges as Creator and Governor, from all mankind; or particular ſervice, which was to be rendered him by his peculiar people, according to the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Jewiſh church.</p>
            <p>THE moral laws preſcribe rules for a man's private conduct; as a moral agent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:012772_0008_0F8A934845E3D3E8"/>BUT the civil, beſide the moral ends and purpoſes of individuals, have alſo the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity for their object; and inform a man, how he is to conduct himſelf as a citizen, or a ſubject of a common-wealth.</p>
            <p>NOW theſe precepts, which I have here read, are of a civil nature, and inſtruct us how we are to behave as members of a community, in caſes of injury to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; whether that injury relate to his property or his perſon. For the paſſage more at large is to this effect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>BREACH for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: as he cauſed a blemiſh in a man, ſo ſhall it be done to him again. He that killeth a beaſt ſhall reſtore it, and he that killeth a</hi> man, <hi>ſhall be put to</hi> death. <hi>Ye ſhall have</hi> one man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of law, <hi>as well for the</hi> ſtranger, <hi>as for one</hi> of your own country; <hi>for I am the Lord your God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ASSIST us therefore almighty God! that with all due attention we may acquire in the firſt place a proper notion of thy immence authority, and how far it exceeds that of human lawgivers; and then we ſhall be able more clearly to diſcover and duly conſider the high impiety, and fatal conſequences of ſcreening or abetting murder.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:012772_0009_0F8A934907C6B518"/>BUT firſt, as the almighty here urges his authority, as the cauſe that challenges obedience to this law; <hi>Do it— for I am the Lord thy God</hi>—Let us conſider with fear and trembling the extent of his authority, and how far it exceeds that of human lawgivers.</p>
            <p>THE authority of God then, as the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme lawgiver, being founded upon two of his attributes; his infinite unerring wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in diſcerning always what is fitteſt to be done, on the one hand; and his infinite and irreſiſtible power, always ready to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand obedience to his ordinances, on the other: It comes to paſs from hence, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry human law muſt either be taken directly from the laws of God; or elſe be ſo ſtrictly ſubordinate, and conformable to his laws, as not to carry with it the leaſt appearance of oppoſition to the ſame. For if that were poſſible, there might be laws of human in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, which might oppoſe themſelves to the will of God, which attempt we ſhall find by the ſequel to be not only impious with reſpect to God, but unwarrantable, and impracticable, with reſpect to man.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt, BECAUSE they are only ſuch laws, as are conformable to the will of God, that can give a magiſtrate a right to command obedience.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, BECAUSE they are only ſuch, that
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:012772_0010_0F8A934A938DE3D0"/>
can be uſeful to ſociety: and therefore,</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, ONLY ſuch, that will be ſubmitted to by the bulk of mankind, without rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, or reſiſtance.</p>
            <p>THE firſt demonſtration then of God's ſuperiority as a lawgiver is evident from hence, that none but ſuch laws as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to his will can impower an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man magiſtrate to require, or command obedience. For all human powers become powers, and derive their whole force from conforming themſelves in their conduct to the will of God. Every act of theirs, which is oppoſed to God's ordinances, is in itſelf null and void. And if the whole adminiſtration of any power be only a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of ſuch acts, then that power ceaſes of courſe to be a legiſlature: The whole ſeries of government from the beginning having been illegal, in being a power op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing itſelf to the ordinances of God, and by conſequence no power at all, ſince the powers, that be, muſt be ordained by him, and as ſuch muſt conform to his ordinances in every act of their juriſdiction. If any one think that this concluſion is not fairly collected, let him conſider upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the nature of God's ſupremacy.</p>
            <p>FOR as he is the ſupreme being, and the center of all power, the power of making
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:012772_0011_0F8A934C5F7EF530"/>
laws and of governing by them muſt be originally and independently in him alone. Nothing under God can pretend to that power independent of him. For the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency of any power neceſſarily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes ſupremacy. As the ſupremacy of God therefore gives to him alone the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and independent power of making laws, ſo it makes it a property to his laws, that his and only his excluded all poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of doubt and heſitation about the obedience, which we are to render them.</p>
            <p>BECAUSE there is no will above his, which we can offend, or power above his, which we need to fear. His abſolute dominion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves every doubt about his authority. All heſitation on that head ariſing from a fear of offence to a perſon more powerful than him, whom we are ordered to obey, and whoſe diſpleaſure may for that reaſon bring a greater inconvenience upon our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. As therefore there is none more powerful than God, an immediate obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his laws is neceſſarily and inexcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably due upon all occaſions; which thing is a great intrenchment upon human pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and lays us under a continual neceſſity of examining human injunctions by the rule of God's ordinances, in order to ſee that they do not claſh with them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:012772_0012_0F8A934D0E5ECD70"/>FOR as man is ſo infinitely inferior to God, laws preſcribed by any, of human race, are as different in obligation from thoſe preſcribed by God, as a creature is different from his Creator. It is of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of human laws therefore, by whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they ſhall be enacted, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not of authority command obedience, till they appear upon the caſe to be agreeable to God's ordinances. Whereas laws which are conformable to the will of God would be obeyed voluntarily, without any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of a magiſtrate, for the ſole reaſon of their uſe, and excellence.</p>
            <p n="2">II. WHICH leads me to another reaſon why all human laws muſt be conformable to the will of God, from the conſideration that only ſuch can be beneficial to mankind.</p>
            <p>FOR if we are ſenſible that the laws of God, as far as they are diſcerned by us, do all of them center in the happineſs of man, both of individuals and of whole ſocieties, it is a natural conſequence, that whatever injunctions oppoſe thoſe laws, muſt oppoſe at the ſame time human happineſs.</p>
            <p>THIS truth perhaps may ſtrike and effect us more ſtrongly if we illuſtrate it by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inſtances. For example, let us imagine that natural equity and juſtice
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:012772_0013_0F8A934D8E5641F0"/>
one of the primary or principal laws of God ſhould be violated for the ſake of ſome oppoſite human law, and you will ſoon ſee in what degree that human law will be detrimental. For natural juſtice and equity having regard to the reaſon and fitneſs of things, and diſtributing to every one, what his circumſtances in impartial right require, the law which goes about to reverſe it, muſt overturn all fitneſs, oppoſe all reaſon, and take from every one what his condition and circumſtances by impartial right re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. Suppoſe the decemviri at <hi>Rome,</hi> or the whole <hi>Roman</hi> ſenate, or the council of five hundred at <hi>Athens,</hi> under the pretence of quelling a riot had ſigned a decree to draw out a party of their forces, mercena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which they paid and fed for their own defence, and place them in ſuch manner that they ſhould, under the pretext of the riot, privately ſhoot at and deſtroy a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their innocent ſubjects paſſing at a diſtance in the public ways upon their own peaceable concerns, and not ſuſpecting danger.</p>
            <p>SUPPOSE, that after the ſlaughter, they ſhould exult publicly in a weak and cowardly manner upon the death of theſe innocent, unarmed, unſuſpecting people, as though they had defeated the army of a
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:012772_0014_0F8A934F65157050"/>
foreign enemy, publicly thank their mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary executioners for their bloody ſervice, tell them, that they had done their duty and that they highly approved of their conduct; encourage them further to do their work of blood with alacrity, promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them all the protection againſt the laws, which their office could afford them, if ſuch protection ſhould ever be wanted upon a like occaſion.</p>
            <p>COULD ordinances and injunctions like theſe be beneficial to ſociety, or could any one pretend to deny, but that by conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them all outward order muſt be deſtroyed, and all inward peace diſturbed? For what makes the mind of man eaſy is, that he ſees his affairs run in the right chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, and that he is dealt with in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that he might reaſonably expect to be dealt with: As on the contrary if any thing reverſe the equitable diſtribution of things, by cauſing miſery, it as neceſſarily cauſes anxiety and diſcontent, as juſtice produces peace and harmony.</p>
            <p>FURTHER we are to obſerve, that when outward order is deſtroyed by cruelty, and the inward peace of men's minds diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, civil troubles and commotions muſt by degrees enſue. For peace and ſecurity are the end and aim of all human labour;
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:012772_0015_0F8A9350173DDFF8"/>
we keep our lives for their enjoyment, and hazard them for their purchaſe. As men are thus ſpirited and informed by nature, we may imagine that they will be very much alarmed under the apprehenſion of ſuch rules or orders, as threaten their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural peace and ſecurity, and thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy their happineſs.</p>
            <p>IT will appear, therefore, in the third place, that ſuch laws or orders as are not conformable to the will of God, by being of no uſe or benefit, but really hurtful to mankind, will be attended with this other inconvenience, that they will rarely be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived or obeyed with quietneſs.</p>
            <p>FOR public diſcontent and trouble ſoon paſs into open oppoſition. In ſuch caſes, it is generally, only a defect of the means of reſiſtance, or the power of helping themſelves, which can keep people in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, ſuppoſing that thoſe, who are thus oppreſſed and irritated, are barely permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but to live. Human reſentment, when continually kept awake, will be contriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the means, and obſerving every opportunity, to reſiſtan unjuſt and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic injunction. Similitude of misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes ſoon forms and fixes an alliance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Alliances multiply in an intereſting cauſe:
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:012772_0016_0F8A935099D265B8"/>
And as ſtrength increaſes, accidents, when carefully watched, are ſeldom wanting to furniſh an opportunity for open and avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed reſiſtance, to which men are encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by that other conſideration, that the law, which oppoſes their happineſs, is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe oppoſite to the laws of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at the ſame time that it would injure them, in caſe it were obeyed, it has really no right to command their obedience. Strong motives for them to diſobey! when beſide their temporal intereſt, other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections at the ſame time naturally preſent themſelves, and give a religious ſanction to their cauſe; as that they are to obey God rather than man, and regard him in the firſt place, who is the ſupreme lawgiver, and far more dreadful in his puniſhments than earthly tyranny in all its terrors.</p>
            <p>HAVING thus conſidered the immenſe authority of God, as the ſupreme legiſlator, and how far it exceeds that of human law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givers, namely, as far as infinite excels finite, we ſhall be able readily to determine, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any human power can have a right to oppoſe or diſpenſe with his laws; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly that, which is ſo clearly and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly declared in the text, and which make the foundation of human ſafety in ſociety.—<hi>He that killeth a man ſhall be put to
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:012772_0017_0F8A935278857F68"/>
death</hi>; in ſupport of which I am now to ſhew the impiety and fatal conſequences of ſcreening and abetting murder.</p>
            <p>IN the firſt place then, any oppoſition to this law would be the higheſt impiety. For as the command is ſo very expreſs and clear, it would be flying in the face of God almighty to diſobey it. And therefore thoſe, who are concerned in ſuch an attempt, let them be of what rank and condition they will, can expect nothing but God's vengeance in this life, and the inſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble terrors of that, which is to come. But beſides the impiety of this attempt, and conſequent vengeance of God almighty, there are other arguments drawn from the injuſtice of ſlaying the innocent, and the danger ariſing from ſuch horrid crimes, not only to individuals therein concerned, but even to Governors themſelves in their public capacity, as render it quite imprac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable by the law of nature, and all the rules of juſt policy, that this divine injunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould ever be repealed or laid aſide.</p>
            <p>FOR firſt, by the laws of nature, every man has a right to ſafety in his perſon, effects, and other circumſtances; unleſs that right be ſome how forfeited by miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanor. And therefore in civilized ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety men are always conſidered in this views
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:012772_0018_0F8A9352C80A7CA8"/>
and are protected in the enjoyment of theſe privileges by the civil magiſtrate. If that magiſtrate acts in his true and proper cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, he watches over the ſafety of the people, and ſhould reſiſt, repulſe, or puniſh thoſe, who hurt the ſubject. For imagine only theſe civil reſtraints removed, and a military armed force let looſe upon the defenceleſs and innocent; and what devaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, rapine and bloodſhed, what afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and miſery in every ſhape, and on every ſide, muſt overwhelm mankind? To fall proſtrate before theſe ſavages, is to invite them to the ſpoil, and encourage them to ſuch acts of violence as muſt end in the deſtruction of ſociety, by baniſhing from among men their ſafety and their peace.</p>
            <p>IT appears then, that in all countries ſome men ought to be oppoſers of injuries by exacting blood for blood: And throughout the known world, where ſocieties are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, ſome men are really ſet apart for that purpoſe. It may be obſerved in different ſtates and nations, that theſe are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways people of exactly the ſame quality, or denomination: And for this there is good reaſon; becauſe thoſe circumſtances are to be regulated from time to time accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the original compact of the ſtate, the great charter, which binds them to ſociety,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:012772_0019_0F8A93549758F978"/>
and according to the various circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, under which, the common-wealth at different ſeaſons may ſubſiſt.</p>
            <p>THE right of oppoſing injuries, and of ſlaying a murderer, is originally to be ſure in every individual who is formed by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to defend himſelf. But upon uniting in ſociety, men ſo far transfer this right to thoſe, they call their Governors, as to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe it no more themſelves, except in caſes, where the Governor's power wilfully fails, or is accidentally not at hand to aſſiſt them. Rulers then, whether they be few or many, or by whatſoever titles they may be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, are, by their office conſtituted, and for this end hold their authority, to be a terror to murderers, and thoſe who do violence, and to defend the natural rights and privileges of their people. There is by nature a tacit compact of this kind between magiſtrates and people: And in moſt places an expreſs engagement confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by ſolemn oaths, and obligations on both ſides. In forms of government ſo circumſtanced, if the Governor fail to act the part aſſigned him, the condition of the obligation on the part of the people is void <hi>ipſo facto</hi>: For by loſing the character of protector he abdicates the right and title of a Prince.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:012772_0020_0F8A93554C45D880"/>SO that the neglect to puniſh murderers appears to be deſtructive to Princes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; as it may, and has ſometimes proved a means of depriving them of their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, at other times of loſing the affections of their people, and drawing a long train of misfortunes upon their own <note n="*" place="bottom">This has been obſerved of the poſterity of <hi>James</hi> the firſt, whoſe favorite <hi>Carr,</hi> was one of the murderers of Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury.</hi> See more of this affair, and the character of the ſaid <hi>James,</hi> in a Poem of the author's, entitled, the voluntary Exile.</note> poſterity. Certain it is, that it has been a means to deprive them of their authority. Since we find that ſovereigns are by their office re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired as far as the ſtate can enable them to ward off injuries; and therefore in caſe of neglect the people have imagined, that they may reſume this delegated power of reſiſting injuries, and executing it for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>NOR is this the only caſe wherein the bad conduct of Princes has furniſhed the people with a plea for taking the reins of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into their own hands. For ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſupreme magiſtrate (which is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural enough upon forſaking his own ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects) to league with the enemy; or upon his own motive, or choice to grow injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; the people have then taken upon them to reſiſt that magiſtrate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:012772_0021_0F8A9355CBAD6CF8"/>
               <q>FOR, ſay they, if thoſe very perſons, who are impowered and appointed for the defence of the ſociety, turn their authority and power againſt it, and inſtead of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing, commit injuries, they are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to be reputed public enemies. For a public enemy could do nothing worſe. The power of reſiſting injuries therefore muſt in ſuch a caſe immediately change place; ſince for the preſervation of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, it muſt ſubſiſt ſome where: And as the ſame perſon cannot at the ſame time be both offender and the puniſher of his own offences; it revolves then back to thoſe who gave it, and in regard it is to be employed againſt ſuch as do injuries, it will bear hard upon thoſe, who are really found in that character, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect had to any nominal diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q>
This is very evident from the hiſtory of <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt, who tho' a King by title, was formally arraigned for coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing the murder of his ſubjects, and executed accordingly as a criminal. From a perſuaſion that the laws were equally a rule of action for the ſubject, and the Prince; conſequently, that if Princes broke the laws, they muſt ſuffer the penalties like other men.</p>
            <p>SO dangerous is it for Princes to think, that they have a right of diſpenſing with, or oppoſing the laws of almighty God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:012772_0022_0F8A9356967ECDE8"/>AND the deception has been quite as fatal to ſuch, as have made themſelves their tools or advocates.</p>
            <p>THOSE who will take the trouble of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting our ancient hiſtories, which if duly attended to, contain treaſures of uſeful knowledge both for the ſubject, and the Prince will find theſe wrerches, I mean the advocates for bloody, and deſpotic meaſures, notwithſtanding their high expectation of reward, generally diſappointed of their hopes, treated for the moſt part as the peſts of ſociety, followed by the execration of the people, or extinguiſhed by a violent death.</p>
            <p>IF the time or place would permit, many examples of this ſort might be produced; eſpecially in the reigns of our week and obſtinate, or ignorant and unexperienced <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>In the reign of <hi>Edward</hi> II. the ridiculous fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which that Monarch expreſſed for Gaveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, created innumerable diſputes. At length the barons had recourſe to arms, and Gaveſton was beheaded. After that, <hi>Spenſer</hi> the father was without a trial, hanged and quartered; and his ſon executed on a gallows fifty feet high.</p>
                  <p>In the reign of <hi>Richard</hi> II. we may obſerve the fate of the great lawyers, who entered into a conſpiracy with the King againſt the laws; and ſet themſelves to invent new articles of treaſon or precedents of outlawry, which might take off, or diſable the popular Lords.

            <p>BUT the ſoldiers concerned in the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the deceaſed, by what authority I know not, were off their poſt, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing another man acroſs the road into a yard where there was a cowhouſe; the deceaſed, who had juſt parted from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation which he had with his mother, was going about his father's buſineſs, but ſeeing, as it is imagined, at that inſtant, from his father's houſe, the motion in the

fields, went out into the high road before the houſe, to inform himſelf farther; when obſerving the man purſued, and the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers following to go into the yard above mentioned, he went after them by another way nearer his father's premiſſes to ſee the event; by this time the man they had purſued had made his eſcape, by ſhutting the door of the cowhouſe againſt the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, who coming in juſt as the deceaſed entered by another door, would not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form themſelves who he was, but with oaths encouraged each other to ſhoot him upon the ſpot.

            <p>THIS eagerneſs therefore to ſhed ſuch innocent blood, muſt give every thinking man more cauſe to ſuſpect that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for uſing the troops effectually was very poſitive, from ſome quarter or other, otherwiſe the offence of the murderers would be ſtill more inſolent and preſumptuous, if committed of their own motion. It may be difficult perhaps at preſent to know preciſely, who were their accomplices, till

by a judicial or parliamentary enquiry, matters ſhall be brought to light. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, however, may be gathered from the ſtyle of the warrant from the Secretary of State to the Juſtices of the Peace, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to theſe hoſtilities, and likewiſe from the letter, which has lately appeared in print from the Secretary at war. The contents of which letter are of a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary nature and more alarming than any act of authority, that has been publiſhed in <hi>England</hi> ſince the fixing of our conſtitution, at the revolution under King <hi>William</hi> III.
