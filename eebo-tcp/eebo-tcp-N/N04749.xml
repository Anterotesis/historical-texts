            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

He ſaid unto them, an Enemy hath done this: The Servants ſaid unto him, wiil thou then that we go and gather them up?

                     </gap> up alſo the Wheat with them. Let both grow together until the Harveſt; And in the Time of the Harveſt, I will ſay to the Reapers, gather ye together firſt the Tares, and l<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> them in Bundles to burn them; but gather the Wheat into my Barn.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>DEAR Brethren, I beg your patient Attention, while I deliver to you the Counſels of GOD from theſe Words. — This <hi>Parable</hi> was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd by Chriſt to check a Humour, which he foreſaw would be too prevalent in ſome of his own dear <hi>Servants:</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:005926_0004_10276D5063D17EA0"/>
And it affords us many uſeful <hi>Obſervations,</hi> which I ſhall mention in the Order they occur; explaining the Text as I go along.</p>
            <p>The firſt OBSERVATION is, That <hi>there is, has been, and always will be, a Mixture of good Seed &amp; had,</hi> of Tares <hi>and</hi> Wheat <hi>in the</hi> viſible Church <hi>of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>till his ſecond Coming.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto a Man which ſowed good Seed in his Field; But while Men ſlept, his Enemy come and ſowed Tares among the Wheat</hi>— By the <hi>Field</hi> is meant <hi>the World,</hi> as our Saviour explains it, v. 38. In this <hi>Field</hi> Chriſt ſows <hi>good Seed, i. e.</hi> he gathers a Church out of the <hi>World,</hi> which are called <hi>the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Kingdome,</hi> v. 38. He ſeparates a Number to himſelf out of the corrupt Maſs of Mankind; effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally calling them by his Word and Spirit, waſhing away their Sins in his moſt precious Blood, and renewing their Natures, and purifying their Hearts, and making them like GOD in Holineſs.—While he was doing this, <hi>an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, viz.</hi> Satan <hi>came and ſowed Tares among the Wheat, i. e.</hi> he ſtirred up <hi>his Children</hi> to join with GOD's People, and to take on them the Chriſtian Profeſſion, and to put on the Garb of Saints: Hence they are ſaid to be <hi>among the Wheat;</hi> they were join'd with them in outward Relation; they became viſible Members, deceiving both themſelves and others. — The former conſtituted the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Church;</hi> but both together made up that Society, which is ſtyled the <hi>Church viſible:</hi> So that <hi>Tares and Wheat</hi> are ever found together within the Pale of the Church. —</p>
            <p>In all Companies there will be evil Intruders; Satan among the Angels; <hi>Soul</hi> among the Prophets; <hi>Judas</hi> among the Apoſtles; <hi>Dames</hi> among the Profeſſors.— The Church in Scripture is compared to a <hi>Net,</hi> which incloſes good Fiſh and bad; to a <hi>Floor,</hi> where the good
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:005926_0005_10276D51F8CB5E20"/>
Grain is mixt with the Chaff; and to a <hi>Houſe,</hi> in which there are Veſſels of <hi>Gold and Silver,</hi> and others of <hi>Wood and Earth,</hi> and <hi>ſome to Honour,</hi> and <hi>ſome to Diſhonour.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.47. and 3.12. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.20.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Oh! how many are there, who are Friends of Chriſt in <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> &amp; yet Enemies to him in <hi>Affection?</hi> The <hi>vileſt</hi> of Creatures do ſometimes creep into the <hi>pureſt</hi> of Churches: The <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>fooliſh Virgins</hi> are blended together; good and bad Seed are mixt for a while; the Heirs of Salvation, and the Veſſels of Wrath may be of one Church, and eat at one Table: <hi>all are not Iſrael, that are of Iſrael,</hi> Rom. 9.6.</p>
            <p>This is a Miſery greatly to be bewailed, but cannot be fully remedy'd, till the Judgment Day, when <hi>Sheep</hi> and <hi>Goats,</hi> true and falſe Profeſſors will be ſeparated for ever. — However in the mean Time, Miniſters and Churches ſhould be very careful in this Matter; <hi>They ſhould learn to be more watchful in Admiſſions to the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If Men ſleep, the Devil will ſow Tares;</hi> If the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful be negligent, He will fill the Church with Swarms of Hypocrites; many of which might be kept out, if due Care be uſed.</p>
            <p>Is it not too evident even in our Days, that the Doors of the Church have been open'd too wide? Has there not been a great <hi>Remiſsneſs</hi> in the <hi>Examination</hi> &amp; Tryal of Candidates for Communion? And have not many unfound Members crowded in by this Means? — and has not the due Exerciſe of <hi>Diſcipline</hi> been greatly neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, whereby they have continued to infeſt the Church? — The Lord pardon our great Delinquency in this Reſpect, and ſtir us up to be more watchful. — No <hi>Perils</hi> ſo great, as thoſe occaſion'd by <hi>falſe Brethren:</hi> We think to fill the Church, but we do but fill the Houſe with Thieves; Wicked Men ever prove a
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:005926_0006_10276D5386404010"/>
Trouble. — a Body made up of this Mixture becomes like a Body overcharged with ill Humours, and truly Sick. — By <hi>promiſcuous Admiſſions,</hi> we bring in ſuch a Miſchief to the Church, as we cannot eaſily get rid of.- What need then of Circumſpection in this Matter? — Yet after all, let the ſtricteſt Care be uſed, there will ſome Hypocrites creep in; and GOD permits it for the Church's <hi>Trial,</hi> and the Wicked's <hi>Harding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Second OBSERVATION is, that <hi>the good and bad Seed may be ſo alike as to outward Appearance, that there is no diſtinguiſhing them for a great while.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Tares</hi> did not appear at firſt, but lay concealed, <hi>'till the Blade ſprung up, and bro't forth Fruit.</hi> v. 26. 'Twas not the <hi>Stalk,</hi> but the <hi>Fruit</hi> that diſtinguiſh'd them. — It is St. <hi>Jeram's</hi> Obſervation, that Wheat and Tares in thoſe Eaſtern Countries, are ſo much alike in their firſt ſpringing up, that 'tis exceeding difficult to diſtinguiſh the one from the other: <hi>The Difference</hi> faith he, <hi>between them is either none at all, or wonderful difficult to diſcern.</hi>—They ſo aſſociate and unite themſelves with the Corn, as if they were the very ſame. And if this be ſo difficult; how much more ſo is it to diſcern the Difference between <hi>ſpecial</hi> and <hi>common Grace</hi> in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. — There is no Grace, but a Hypocrite may have ſomething like it; and there is no Duty done by a Chriſtian, but an Hypocrite nay outſtrip him in it.— So that a very judicious Eye may be led into a Miſtake by the near outward Reſemblance, &amp; take a <hi>Counterfeit</hi> for a <hi>Reality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Does GOD by his Spirit prepare Soul for Chriſt by working in them as a <hi>Spirit of Bondage,</hi> convincing, wounding and humbling them for Sin? And do not many, that never receive Chriſt, partake of theſe <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratives?</hi> Are they not often deeply convinced of, burden'd with, and wounded for Sin? Were not <hi>Pharaoh</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:005926_0007_10276D59A0896C08"/>
and <hi>Soul,</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> and <hi>Felix,</hi> under great Convictions of Sin for a while? And have not many others been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der great <hi>legal Terrors,</hi> yea greater than many of GOD's People ever felt; and yet reſted upon their old Bottom ſtill?</p>
            <p>Doth GOD work Faith in Souls truly convinced and humbled? There is alſo a Faith in Hypocrites. The ſtony Greund Hearers <hi>for a while believe, and in Time of Temptation fall away,</hi> Luk. 8.13. <hi>Then Simon himſelf believed alſo,</hi> Act. 8.13. <hi>Many of the Rulers believed on him, but they durſt not confeſs him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.42. 'Tis ſaid of the hypocritical <hi>Jews,</hi> Iſai. 18.2. <hi>They ſtay'd themſelves upon the GOD of Iſrael.</hi>—</p>
            <p>Doth true Faith work by Love, and fill the Hearts of Believers with vehement Longings and Breathings after Chriſt? — And does not ſomething of this appear in Hypocrites?

Doth not <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.3. ſuppoſe that a Perſon may <hi>give his Body to be burned,</hi> or die a <hi>Martyr</hi> for Chriſt; and yet be deſtitute of <hi>divine Love</hi> or <hi>Charity?</hi> It appears then that the Reſemblance between the Saints and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites come ſo near, as that in many Caſes it may be almoſt impoſſible to diſtinguiſh them.—</p>
            <p>"And the Difference will yet be more ſubtle &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcernable (as Mr. <hi>Flavel</hi> obſerves) if we conſider, that as in ſo many Things, the Hypocrite reſembles the Saint; ſo there are other Things, in which a real Chriſtian may act too like an Hypocrite. — When we find ſays he, a <hi>Pharoah</hi> confeſſing, an <hi>Herod</hi> practiſing, as well as hearing, a <hi>Judas</hi> preaching Chriſt, an <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> venturing his Life for <hi>Paul;</hi> and on the other Side, ſhall find a <hi>David</hi> condemning that in another, which he practiſed himſelf; and <hi>Aſa</hi> in a Rage with a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet for faithfully reproving him, and putting him in Priſon; a <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> joining in Affinity with a wicked <hi>Ahab;</hi> an <hi>Hezekiah</hi> glorying in his Riches; a <hi>Peter</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling; a <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> quarrelling and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending, and even all the Diſciples forſaking Chriſt in an Hour of Trouble and Danger: — Oh then! how hard is it for the Eye of Man to diſcern between Chaff and Wheat? How many upright Hearts are now cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd, whom GOD will clear? How many falſe Hearts are now approved, whom GOD will condemn?

            <p n="1">I. Hence ſee the Error of thoſe who hold, that an <hi>abſolute infallible Knowlege</hi> of the Brethren, is to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by ordinary Believers in this Life.</p>
            <p>We may certainly know our own State; But, 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for us, without divine Inſpiration, ſuch as the Prophets had, abſolutely to know the Goodneſs of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's State. — This is a Point, that has been much in my Meditation; and Time was when I my ſelf tho't, that it was eaſier to know a true Chriſtian, than I now find it to be, tho' I never gave in to the Doctrine of the <hi>infallible Knowlege.</hi> — And therefore I ſhall with all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and Meekneſs, lay before you ſome of thoſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments which convinced me; and I beg you, Dear Brethren, to weigh them impartially in the Balance of the Sanctuary.</p>
            <p>As for thoſe, who walk after the Courſe of this World, fulfilling the Deſires of the Fleſh and of the Mind, and committing Iniquity with Greedineſs, their Caſe is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily known; of theſe we may ſay without Heſitation, <hi>They are in the Gall of Bitterneſs, and Bond of Iniquity.</hi>— And the ſame may be ſaid of ſome formal Profeſſors, who in their Diſcourſe bewray the moſt wretched Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the Nature of Conviction and Converſion.— Setting theſe aſide, there are others who have had great Convictions, Illuminations &amp;c. ſuch as we have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd under the Doctrine; and yet out of Chriſt.—And there are ſome alſo, who tho' deſtitute of theſe in a great Meaſure; yet by aſſociating with Chriſtians, and hearing them frequently give an Account of their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences, and ſeeing them in their Joys, can more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily pretend to have experienced the ſame Things; hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:005926_0012_10276D6E6A272340"/>
If our Light is greater, yet our Improvements of our Light are not ſo great: To our Shame be it ſpoken, we fall vaſtly ſhort of many old Teſtament Believers in Faith, and Love, and other Graces; and therefore have no better Abilities to diſcover Hypocrites than they: there is nothing more in the <hi>Nature</hi> of our Love to the Brethren, to diſtinguiſh the precious from the vile, than was in their's. — If Prophets and inſpired Men were deceived; much more may we, who are but <hi>Babes</hi> and <hi>Novices,</hi> and no more to be compared with them, except in their Infirmities, than a Dwarf to a Giant. —</p>
            <p>The Inſtance of <hi>Judas,</hi> which is ſo often alledged at this Day, is alſo very much to the Purpoſe: The Apoſtles held Communion with this Man for above three Years, and did not ſuſpect him; yea, they were more ſuſpicious of themſelves than of him. — But you will ſay, this was becauſe they were poor, weak, low Believers, and had not ſo much Grace as we have. — But, my Brethren, conſider ſeriouſly, does not this Anſwer favour too much of <hi>ſpiritual Pride!</hi> Is it not contrary to the humble Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the great Apoſtle, who was one of the moſt eminent Believer's that ever was, when he cry'd out, <hi>I am leſs than the leaſt of all Saints! Eph.</hi> 3.8. And is it not an Argument of Weakneſs of Grace, rather than of Strength! For many Believers that have been of your Opinion at their firſt Converſion, have rejected it as an Error, when they came to be more experienced in the divine Life. — Beſides, were not the Apoſtles often in the high Exerciſe of Grace, eſpecially when they made that glorious Confeſſion; <hi>We are ſure that thou art the Chriſt, the Son of the living GOD,</hi> Mat. 16.16. <hi>Job.</hi> 6.69. And when Chriſt told them, that <hi>their Names were written in Heaven? Luk.</hi> 10.20. How come they not to diſcern him at theſe Times, if 'tis the Privilege of

ordinary Believers to know the Brethren, when Grace is in lively Exerciſe?</p>
            <p>Further, the Advice of Chriſt to true Believers, Mat. 7.15. <hi>To beware of falſe Prophets,</hi> ſhews how poſſible it is even for his own People to be deceived &amp; miſled by them for a Time: The Shape into which they transform themſelves, namely, <hi>the Apoſtles of Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Miniſters of Righteouſneſs,</hi> ſhews the difficulty many Times of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them. — The Faithful at <hi>Corinth</hi> were greatly miſled by ſuch Teachers. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.13, 14, 15. They were ſo taken with their Pretences to greater <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Holineſs</hi> than others, that they even look'd upon the Apoſtle as <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>contemptible,</hi> and a <hi>dark Teacher</hi> in compariſon of them.<note n="*" place="bottom">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10, 1, 2, 10.</note> Yea, ſome of them went ſo far as to ſtyle him a <hi>Reprobate</hi> or Unconverted. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.6, 7. Whence he was obliged ſo highly to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend himſelf in the 11th &amp; 12th Chap. And if ſuch a Church as this, ſo famous for Gifts and Graces, did not find it an eaſy Taſk to detect ſuch <hi>Pretenders;</hi> how much leſs eaſy is it in many Caſes for Believers of a low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Claſs to do it?</p>
            <p>Chriſt ſpeaks thus reſpecting the ſtony Ground Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and others, Luk. 8.18. <hi>Whoſoever hath not, from him ſhall be taken even that which he</hi> SEEMETH <hi>to have.</hi> — In the Apprehenſions of Men, both good and bad, he <hi>ſeemeth</hi> to have many Gifts and Graces; but theſe he ſhall be ſtript of and appear as he is: GOD ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſk him firſt or laſt, taking away his common Gifts, or ſuffering him to fall into, and be overcome by foul Temptations.</p>

by St. <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf, 'till his own Mouth bewrayed him; 'till his Selfiſhneſs and Covetouſneſs broke forth at his Lips. — And then it was, and not till then, that <hi>Peter</hi> tells him, <hi>I perceive thou art in the Gall of Bitterneſs &amp;c.</hi> Act. 8.23.

            <p>The Chriſtians in <hi>Rome</hi> even in the Apoſtles Time got a differing about ſome non-eſſential Points; &amp; tho't hardly of one another upon this Account, and began to ſeperate Communions, and to reject each other as Hypocrites.— But the Apoſtle checks them thus, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.10. <hi>Why doſt thou judge thy Brother? Or why doſt thou ſet at nought thy Brother? For we ſhall all ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Judgment Seat of Chriſt.</hi> — They were <hi>Brothren</hi> in Chriſt, notwithſtanding their Difference, and tho'
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005926_0015_10276D80483D67D0"/>
they cenſur'd each other as not being ſo. — Where was their infallible Knowlege all this while?</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle tells the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.19. <hi>There muſt be Hereſies among you, that they which are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved may be made manifeſt among you.</hi> — 'Till the riſing of theſe <hi>Hereſies,</hi> the true and falſe Profeſſor remain'd undiſtinguiſh'd in that Church; they had equally the Repute of good Chriſtians: But then the <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> of the one, and the <hi>Stedfaſtneſs</hi> of the other made them <hi>manifeſt;</hi> the receiving or rejecting the new ſprung Hereſies ſerved as a Teſt to diſtinguiſh them: So that they were found out, not by <hi>Feeling,</hi> but by their <hi>Fruits: Paul</hi> was at great Uncertainties about the <hi>Galatians:</hi> when they were firſt wro't upon by his Miniſtry, he embraced them with open Arms as dear Brethren; but their after Behaviour made him ſuſpicious of them; Hence he ſays, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.20. <hi>I ſtand in Doubt of you.</hi>— How comes this, if he had an infallible Knowledge of their Eſtate at firſt when he received them into the Church, and did not judge them by their after Fruits?</p>

               <hi>Demas</hi> was eſteem'd a firſt rate Chriſtian by this Apoſtle; he took him for his Companion in his Travels, and no doubt had often ſweet Fellowſhip with him; he calls him his <hi>Fellow-Labourer,</hi> Philem. <hi>v.</hi> 24.

They had not theſe in Reality, but only in the Eſtimation of the Apoſtle and other Believers contemporary with them; but they were not <hi>diſcern'd</hi> by any, till their open Apoſtacy.— The humble Language of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Ep. v. 12. becomes us at this Day; <hi>By Sylvanus a faithful Brother to you (as I ſuppoſe) I have written briefly</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005926_0016_10276D81CE350DF0"/>
He did not pretend to an <hi>object<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Knowledge</hi> of <hi>Sylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus's</hi> good Eſtate, tho' intimately acquainted with him, and tho' he employ'd him as his Meſſenger to carry his Epiſtle Abroad; but only goes upon <hi>Suppoſition</hi> and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability; which is the higheſt Knowledge that ordinary Believers can reach, &amp; even the Apoſtles themſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out immediate Revelation.—We may collect from other Scriptures, that this <hi>Sylvanus</hi> was really a good Man; and yet the Apoſtle durſt not aſſert it abſolutely.— And ſhall we pretend to higher Attainments than this great Apoſtle? —</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, the <hi>Suppoſition</hi> does not relate to the <hi>Reality</hi> of his Chriſtanity, but to his <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> in his Station and Office, and particularly in ſerving thoſe to whom St. <hi>Peter</hi> wrote; and therefore the Expreſſion is, <hi>a faithful Brother to you</hi> &amp;c.—I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> This can't be the Senſe, becauſe if he knew him to be a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> he muſt of neceſſity know that he would be <hi>faithful;</hi> for they are inſeparable: And therefore the <hi>Suppoſition</hi> refers as much to his <hi>State,</hi> as to his <hi>Behaviour</hi> towards other Chriſtians: He could not doubt of the one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubting of the other; for an <hi>unfaithful</hi> Man is no Chriſtian. — Beſides we muſt remember, that this Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle is not directed to any particular Church, in which <hi>Sylvanus</hi> was an Officer, but it was <hi>general</hi> to the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians ſcatter'd up and down over all <hi>Aſia,</hi> which included one Quarter of the World. — Now when he <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> him a <hi>faithful Brother</hi> to ſuch a Multitude of Chriſtians in different Parts, (moſt of whom 'tis likely <hi>Sylvanus</hi> had never ſeen,) this is the ſame Thing as if he had ſaid, he <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> him to be a <hi>converted Man.</hi>—</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſome, 1 Joh. 2.19. <hi>They went out from us, but they were not of us, for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: But they went out that it might be made MANIFEST, that they
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005926_0017_10276D84C1752F28"/>
were not all of us.</hi>— As long as they <hi>continued,</hi> they were tho't well of; they were embraced as Chriſtians by the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> and others; but their <hi>going out</hi> diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd their Falſe-heartedneſs &amp; Inſincerity, which before lay hid from all but GOD.</p>
            <p>The <hi>white Stone and new Name, (Rev.</hi> 2.17.) was <hi>known</hi> abſolutely <hi>to none, but thoſe that received it;</hi> others could not come to ſuch <hi>Certainty</hi> reſpecting them.</p>
            <p>Further, The ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> of whom we have an Account, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.3. were planted by the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles themſelves; who no doubt uſed great Care and Caution in the Admiſſion of Members; and yet how many of thoſe Members were <hi>Hypocrites;</hi> ſome of whom were known only to GOD, and others of them in Time diſcover'd it to Man by their corrupt Doctrines and vicious Lives.—And if it was ſo then, much more may it be ſo ſince, when the moſt faithful Miniſters and Chriſtians are deſtitute of thoſe <hi>Gifts,</hi> and the <hi>high De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree</hi> of thoſe <hi>Graces,</hi> which the Apoſtles had.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, St. <hi>John</hi> tells us, Rev. 8.10. <hi>There fell a great Star from Heaven, burning as it were a Lamp.</hi> This <hi>Star</hi> was ſome eminent Profeſſor; He made a great Blaze, and ſhined as much in Appearance as the beſt Chriſtian; He was taken for ſuch a one, till he <hi>fell, i. e.</hi> 'till he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to diſcover himſelf by his damnable Doctrines and wicked Ways; by his Apoſtacy from the Truth.— Some Divines ſuppoſe, that this refers to <hi>Pelagius</hi> that arch Heretic, who before he broached his Hereſy, was had in high Eſteem in the Church of GOD.</p>
            <p>Agreeable to this were the Sentiments of our Fore-Fathers, and all the old <hi>experimental</hi> Writers that ever I read: They all with one voice deny an <hi>infallible Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> in this Caſe; and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

            <p>And ſays Mr <hi>Tennant,</hi> "For any Men to pretend to <hi>know</hi> certainly who are gracious, as one of the <hi>Moravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> did in my Hearing, is to aſſume an incommunicable Prerogative of GOD: And to run upon this <hi>falſe</hi> Plan in Church Matters, is to turn all into the <hi>wildeſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order</hi> and <hi>Confuſion.</hi>—And in another Place he calls it a <hi>deteſtable Notion."</hi>

            <p>But you will ſay, Can we know nothing of the good Eſtate of others? Is the Matter left at ſuch utter Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties: —I Anſwer, There is in this, as in other Caſes, a different Degree of Evidence: Of ſome there are ſuch Evidences given as are exceeding ſatisfying; their Lives are ſo holy, their Teſtimonies are ſo clear, their Converſation ſo ſhining, as to exclude <hi>all Doubt</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their State: Here we may arrive to a <hi>moral</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, <hi>i. e.</hi> the higheſt Degree of Probability, having as much to ſway our Charity, as can be rationally expected in this Life.—Others give only ſlight and more weak Encouragements to our Hope, and mix it with many Occaſions of Fear and Jealouſie concerning them; and yet Hope hath at leaſt ſo much to ſay, that there is ſome <hi>Probability,</hi> at leaſt a <hi>Poſſibility,</hi> that their Hearts may be right with GOD.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, If we may arrive to ſuch a Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge as excludes <hi>all Doubt,</hi> how does this differ from the <hi>abſolute Certainty</hi> that is pleaded for? I Anſwer, There is a conſiderable Difference: There are many Things of which we have no Doubt; and yet there is a <hi>Poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> they may be otherwiſe. — When a credible Man of
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:005926_0019_10276D8FAB25CE90"/>
our Acquaintance give us an Account of a Matter of Fact from his own certain Knowlege, we don't enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain any Doubt concerning the Truth of it; and when a Man in general Repute for Honeſty undertakes a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Truſt, we have not many Times the leaſt Scruple but that he will manage it faithfully; and yet 'tis poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble we may be deceived in both Inſtances, as many have been. We may indeed in the Caſe before us go thus far, and not get beyond our Line:— When we hear any Perſon give a particular Account of his Experiences, and find them agreable to the Word of GOD, we may ſay without Heſitation, <hi>If this Account he right, this Perſon is certainly converted:</hi> But whether he gives a true Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count or no, whether he don't over-do in the Matter, muſt be left with GOD, who <hi>only knows the Hearts of the Children of Men.</hi>—A Perſon who hath ſtudyed the Scriptures, who has read many experimental Sermons, who has heard the Preaching of this Day; who has been preſent when Perſons have expreſs'd themſelves under Conviction or Joy: I ſay, ſuch a Perſon may form ſuch a plauſible Account, as may deceive the very beſt of you, tho' he never had a thoro' <hi>Feeling</hi> of ſuch Things in his own Soul.—Suppoſe that a Man ſhould give an Account, that at ſuch a Time he was ſtruck with Conviction; that at firſt he was very fearful of Hell and Damnation; that afterwards his Sorrow changed, and he was more afflicted with a Senſe of the <hi>Plague</hi> of an hard Heart; that he ſaw himſelf wholly overſpread with the Leproſie of Sin, and that his beſt Duties were an Abomination to the Lord; that he was made ſenſible he could do nothing, and that it would have been juſt in GOD to damn him; And ſo was bro't to the Foot of a ſovereign GOD, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing of all Hope and Help in himſelf:— That then GOD diſcover'd to him Chriſt's Ability &amp; Willingneſs to ſave him; that he alſo made him willing, &amp; enabled
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:005926_0020_10276D9298EB45C0"/>
him to lay hold of and apply ſuch and ſuch Proraiſes; and that hereupon he was fill'd with Comfort and Joy, and his Heart drawn out in Love to GOD and his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:—Suppoſe a Man ſhould give you ſuch an Account as this, would you not believe that he was converted? And yet why might he not feign all this out of his own Heart? If you ſay, none would be ſo Wicked as to do this: I aſk, why not? Have there not been Inſtances of it in all Ages? To deny the Thing, is to deny that there ever was a <hi>wilful Hypocrite</hi> in the World: For thoſe that take up Religion to be ſeen of Men, or for other baſe ſiniſter Ends, ſometimes pretend to this and more; and not only lie to Man, but to GOD too.— If you ſay, that he would diſcover himſelf by the <hi>lifeleſs cold</hi> Manner in which he related ſuch Experiences.— This is no ſufficient Teſt neither: 'Tis too evident that a Hypocrite may counterfeit a lively Reliſh and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of heavenly Things in his Diſcourſe; <hi>Abitophel</hi> did ſo, and <hi>Ezekiel's</hi> Hearers likewiſe, who <hi>with their Mouth ſhew'd much Love</hi> and Fervour, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.31. And yet their Hearts were ſtark nought.— How zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly do Lawyers ſometimes plead for their Clients, as if their very Hearts and Souls were engaged? And yet in Reality they care nothing about their Cauſe; but do all for the Sake of their Fee.—And the ſame Affection may be put on in religious Matters, when the Heart is nothing touched, as Experience has proved in Scores of Inſtances.—</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, Is not the Gift of <hi>diſcerning Spirits</hi> mentioned by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.10. And does not this Gift yet continue in the Chriſtian Church?</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, No; This was altogether <hi>miraculous,</hi> and peculiar to the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity.—That this was an <hi>extraordinary</hi> Gift appears from the Context; <hi>v.</hi> 9, 10. <hi>To another the Gifts of Healing by the ſame Spirit.

To another the working of Miracles; To another Propheſy; To another diſcerning of Spirits; To another divers Kinds of Tongues; To another the Interpretation of Tongues.</hi>—Theſe Things that are mention'd with this Gift of <hi>diſcerning</hi> are all now ceaſed; None now pretend to the Gifts of Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Miracles, Prophecy, ſpeaking with Tongues <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Why then ſhould they pretend to the other? If you have one <hi>Apoſtolick</hi> Gift, why not another? If you can <hi>diſcern Spirits,</hi> why can't you <hi>raiſe the Dead?</hi> The one belongs to you as much as the other.</p>
            <p>Beſides, you may here obſerve from the Words, that this was not a <hi>common Gift</hi> among Chriſtians even at that Day; one had this Gift, and another that; but all had not every one; but <hi>the Spirit divided to every Man ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally as he would,</hi> v. 11. Such Gifts the Apoſtle plainly diſtinguiſhes from ſaving Grace; they were not eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to it; a Man might be a true Chriſtian without them; and a Man have them, and yet be no Chriſtian, as appears from <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.22. and from the 13. <hi>Chap.</hi> of this Epiſtle.—Here it may be objected, that tho' <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning of Spirits</hi> be mention'd among the miraculous Gifts; yet there are ſome Gifts there that are not <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous,</hi> but <hi>ordinary;</hi> as the <hi>Word of Wiſdom, the Word of Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> v. 8, 9. And why mayn't this <hi>diſcerning</hi> be rank'd in the ſame Claſs?— In anſwer to this; I deny the Suppoſition that theſe were <hi>ordinary Gifts:</hi> By <hi>the Word of Wiſdom,</hi> we may underſtand what was promiſed the Apoſtles, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.19. <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.14, 15. Which was in a great Meaſure miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and not to be expected by ordinary Miniſters and Chriſtians, whoſe Duty 'tis to <hi>meditate</hi> before they ſpeak, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.15.—By the <hi>Word of Knowledge</hi> cannot be underſtood the <hi>ſaving</hi> Knowlege of ſpiritual Things; for it is diſtinguiſh'd from that, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.2. But, as ſome think, it may refer to the prophetical Knowlege of
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:005926_0022_10276D9A16144090"/>
future Contingencies, or an uncommon and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Inſight into the dark Paſſages of Scripture.—By <hi>Faith</hi> is meant the <hi>Faith of Miracles,</hi> and not the <hi>Grace of Faith,</hi> as is evident from <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.2.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, Why all this ado to ſcreen Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, and prevent their Diſcovery.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, This is not my Deſign in it: GOD forbid that I ſhould ſpend my Breath in pleading the Cauſe of Hypocrites; 'tis not their Honour or Credit, that I am contending for; the ſooner they are diſcover'd the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for themſelves and others.—But the Reaſons why I am ſo ſtrenuous in this Point are theſe.— (1.) For fear the Conſequence of the oppoſite Doctrine ſhould be the condemning and rejecting ſome of GOD's dear Children.—This is what the Devil drives at by ſowing ſuch <hi>Tares, viz.</hi> to make you think well of the worſt, and condemn the beſt: And this will be the Concluſion of the Matter, if GOD does not graciouſly put a Stop to the ſpreading of this Error. If any will but <hi>join</hi> with you in this <hi>Opinion,</hi> that give but <hi>ſlender Evidences</hi> of their Chriſtanity in compariſon of ſome others that <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe</hi> it, you will be in Danger of receiving the former as <hi>dear Brethren,</hi> and of rejecting the latter as <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites.</hi>— Such is commonly the Conſequence of <hi>errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Tenets,</hi> when zealouſly eſpouſed and urged. —(2.) It may prove a dreadful Snare to you.—If you give Way to one Error, you get upon the <hi>Devil's Ground;</hi> and when you are there, you don't know how far he may carry you: It may bring Darkneſs on you all your Days. (3.) Nothing hath been a greater Hindrance to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> than the prevailing of ſuch Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.—GOD hath been doing great &amp; wonderful Things for us in this Land of late Years, in the Conviction and Converſion of Sinners and in the comforting and build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

Things are now come to a full Stop? And is not this one chief Cauſe of it, the Prevalency of <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Diſorders</hi> in ſome of the Subjects of this Work? When Men ſee ſome of the Promoters of the Reformation out-run themſelves, and broach Principles repugnant to the Scriptures, it prejudices them more againſt Chriſt and his Cauſe, and ſettles and hardens them in their evil Ways. So that ſuch will have the Blood of Souls to anſwer for.— (4.) Nothing tends more to weaken the Hands of Chriſtians, than Jangles and Diſputes about ſuch Points: It takes off their Thot's from weightier Matters, and hinders them in their Work, and renders them a Prey to the common Enemy. And ſeeing the Conſequences are ſo bad, I beg you in the Bowels of <hi>Jeſus</hi> to conſider better of the Matter, and to reject every Thing that is contrary to found Doctrine, and to join Heart &amp; Hand in promoting the Work of GOD.— Be no longer in this fort <hi>Keepers of others Vineyards,</hi> but be careful to keep your own, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.6. 'Tis amazing to me, that this Principle ſhould prevail with any at this Time of Day: I don't much wonder that ſome run into it at their firſt Converſion; but that they ſhould ſtill hold it, after they have ſeen ſo many Inſtances of thoſe whom they verily tho't to be true Believers, this Apoſtacy is truly aſtoniſhing.—May the Lord lead us all in the Paths of Truth and Holineſs.</p>

               <hi>When the Blade ſprung up and bro't forth Fruit, then appear'd the Tares alſo,</hi> v. 26. 'Twas the different Fruit, that diſcover'd them; before 'twas not ſo eaſy to ſee the Difference. —'Tis the ſole Prerogative of GOD to know the Heart <hi>immediately,</hi> Jer. 11.20. Rev. 2.23. Men muſt judge others by <hi>outward</hi> &amp; <hi>ſenſible</hi> Signs; <hi>i. e.</hi> by the Fruits of their Lips, and of their Lives.— As long as theſe are good, we are to think <hi>charitably;</hi> but when it is otherwiſe, we may juſtly account them <hi>Tares.—Simon Magus</hi> diſcover'd his Hypocriſy by his Diſcourſe, and <hi>Demas</hi> by his Life. — When <hi>forward Profeſſors</hi> become <hi>open Apoſtates,</hi> then the <hi>Blade and the Fruit appear,</hi> and they are plainly to be diſtinguiſh'd from the <hi>Wheat.</hi> —Moſt unſound Profeſſors fall off firſt or laſt; They are oftentimes left of GOD to run into <hi>Hereſy</hi> or <hi>Scandal,</hi> before their Death. We have three Texts of Scripture, which are the Rules we are to go by in <hi>judging</hi> of others. — The firſt is, 1 Sam. 16.7. <hi>The Lord ſeeth not as Man ſeeth (i. e.</hi> as all Men whether good or bad ſee;) <hi>for Man looketh at the outward Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but the Lord looketh on the Heart.</hi> — By the <hi>outward Appearance</hi> is meant their Words &amp; Behaviour; if they are right and agreeable to the Word, we are to judge that the Heart is right too; and to leave it with GOD:— Nothing but a Revelation from Heaven, ſuch as <hi>Samuel</hi> had, can undeceive us in this Matter; and can we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect

               </gap>t be alledged againſt this, Joh. 7.24. <hi>Judge not according to the Appearance, but judge righteous Judgment.</hi> — This is nothing to the Purpoſe of judging the Hearts of others: The Caſe was this, The <hi>Jews</hi> ſeeing our Lord cure an infirm Perſon upon the Sabbath Day, preſently upon that Semblance condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him of violating the Law; not conſidering either the Senſe of the Law, or the Nature of his Performance; and this he termeth <hi>unrighteous Judgment:</hi>— Such an Action ſeem'd to encroach upon the Sabbath; but it did not really; therefore he exhorts them to conſider and <hi>judge righteouſly:</hi> But it hath no Reference to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Hearts of others. — We muſt not call thoſe Actions wicked, which are good in themſelves; this is the <hi>judging</hi> by the <hi>Appearance,</hi> which is here condemned.</p>
            <p>A ſecond Text is Mat. 7.16. <hi>Ye ſhall know them by their Fruits. i. e.</hi> by their corrupt Principles and Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices: As for the Root, the Heart from whence theſe proceeded, they could know nothing of that immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; only ſo far as they manifeſted it by their Speech and Behaviour: 'Tis the Effect that diſcovers the Cauſe, which will lie hid 'till then.</p>
            <p>A third Text is that, Jam. 2.18. <hi>I will ſhew thee my Faith by my Works.</hi> By Faith is meant inward Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and by <hi>Works</hi> the Life and Converſation: When the Profeſſion of Faith be right, and the Converſation agreeable, then we are obliged by the Laws of GOD to think well of others; we are to look upon them as true Chriſtians; their Faith is ſhewed to us by the Effects, <hi>viz.</hi> their Works. — Hence the Apoſtle adds, <hi>v.</hi> 24. <hi>You ſee then how by Works a Man is juſtifyed, and not by Faith only.</hi>—This means Juſtification in the Sight of Men, both good &amp; bad, &amp; not Juſtification in the Sight to GOD: <hi>Good Works</hi> are neceſſary to evidence to Men the Truth of our Faith, and the Reality of our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:005926_0026_10276DAB0ED59798"/>
where theſe are not, all is but Pretence and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy; but if we find theſe, 'tis not Chriſtian to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the Heart.—</p>
            <p>Theſe are the <hi>Rules</hi> of Judgment, which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture lays down; and very arrogant and high-minded is that Man or Woman, which will not ſubmit to them.— We muſt not pretend to meddle with the ſecret Tho'ts, Affections and Purpoſes of Men, not expreſs'd by plain Words, nor declared by overt Acts: This is that <hi>raſh judging,</hi> which the Scripture over &amp; over forbids.—A Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of <hi>judging</hi> doth ever ſuppoſe a Power of Cognizance; and it being impoſſible for us to reach the Knowledge of thoſe Things, otherwiſe than as they expreſs them; we cannot therefore pretend to judge of them.—As it is the Property of GOD to <hi>ſearch the Hearts, and try the Reins;</hi> ſo it is his Prerogative to judge concerning the ſecret Motions of them; the which we attempting to do, no leſs vainly and fooliſhly, than preſumtuouſly and profanely encroach upon.—It is only in the great Day, that GOD will bring ſuch <hi>hidden Things to Light, and will make manifeſt the Counſels of the Heart; therefore judge nothing before the Time,</hi> 1 Cor. 4, 5.—'Tis ſaid concerning Chriſt, Joh. 2.23, 24, 25. <hi>Now when he was in Jeruſalem at the Paſſover, in the Feaſt Day, many believed in his Name, when they ſaw the Miracles which he did: But Jeſus did not commit himſelf unto them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he know all Men, and needed not that any ſhould teſtify of Man; for he knew what was in Man.</hi> As much as to ſay, if he had been only a Man, he would have been deceived by their Profeſſion of Faith; but ſince he was GOD as well as Man, their Hypocriſy was plain to him; he perfectly knew Men, not only from their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Acts and Behaviour, (as we know them,) but he knew what was in them, ſearching the Hearts, as he was GOD.—The Apoſtle ſays, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.7. <hi>Charity

believeth all Things:</hi> Without preſuming to judge Men's Hearts, or to pry into their ſecret Intentions, it diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes us to think favourably of every one, ſo far as they walk agreable to the Laws of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Hence infer <hi>the Miſtake of thoſe, who ſet up another Standard to judge Men by than</hi> their outward Fruits, <hi>viz.</hi> their inward Feeling.</p>
            <p>There are ſome that tell us, that let others give ever ſo fair an Account of their Experiences, and let their Lives be never ſo regular, yet this is not to be depended on; this is not ſufficient to ſway our Charity, unleſs there be an inward working of our Souls towards them; unleſs we <hi>feel</hi> them by an inward Sympathy and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and our Hearts be knit to them. In Anſwer to this, to prevent Miſtakes, I would premiſe; That there is a <hi>divine Affection</hi> implanted in God's Children to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards one another; their Hearts, when they are in the Exerciſe of Grace, will be drawn out in Love towards each other, and will be as it were knit together.—But this I deny, that this is any Rule of judging another's gracious Eſtate:—This <hi>Feeling</hi> (which is more or leſs in every Chriſtian) is not at all the <hi>Evidence</hi> of that; but the Evidences muſt preceed, <hi>viz.</hi> Some Knowledge of their Faith and Holineſs expreſs'd in Words or Deeds; and then this Effect follows, <hi>viz.</hi> A drawing out of the Heart toward them.—They have firſt ſome Reaſon to believe that they are true Chriſtians from their Fruits that appear, and then they love them; but this <hi>Love</hi> in it ſelf conſider'd is no <hi>Evidence</hi> at all, i. e. reſpecting others, tho' it be to our ſelves, of our own good Eſtate.</p>
            <p>The contrary Opinion, namely, that our <hi>Feeling</hi> or our Flow of Affection is the only Standard to know ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I look upon to be of dangerous Tendency.— I would aſk the Patrons of it; Does this <hi>Feeling,</hi> as 'tis a <hi>Seal</hi> or <hi>Evidence</hi> of another's Graciouſneſs, come thro'
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:005926_0028_10276DB3C4E68828"/>
the Mediation of the Word? Does it derive from the Scriptures?—No, that can't be; becauſe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has no where ſaid, that ſuch and ſuch by Name are converted or unconverted.—Does this <hi>Feeling</hi> come from the Spirit without the Word? Then it is an <hi>

into the Church? This would have ſettled the Matter at once, and it would have been impoſſible for an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite to have crept into the Miniſtry or the Church, if there had been but a ſpiritual Soul in the Exerciſe of Grace to have try'd them; they would have <hi>felt</hi> them out and hiſs'd them away.—But the Scripture is wholly ſilent about any ſuch Method, and gives us other Rules to go by.</p>
            <p>Beſides, If it is as ſome aſſert, that if two Perſons ſhould give exactly the ſame Account of their Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and in the ſame Manner, and their Lives ſhould be the ſame; and the one ſhould be an Hypocrite, &amp; the other not, they could diſtinguiſh them by their <hi>Feeling;</hi> I ſay, if they could do this, why can't they as well tell without hearing their Experiences at all?—'Tis not that that ſatisfies them, but ſomething elſe, namely, the <hi>inward Operation</hi> of their Souls; and why mayn't there be this, without any verbal Account from them?—If this <hi>Feeling</hi> aroſe from what they give an Account of, they would have as much <hi>Charity</hi> for the one as for the other; but ſeeing they have not, it is ſome other Rule they go by, namely the <hi>Revelation</hi> or <hi>Witneſs of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:</hi>—Conſequently they could know their State with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out talking with them, as well as with; this anſwers no End at all.— This is a plain Caſe; I inſiſt upon it, that if it is this <hi>internal divine Affection</hi> we are to judge by, and not what they tell us of, we can as certainly tell without diſcourſing with them as with; only by looking upon another we know his State.—And what a ſtrange Doctrine is this.—Neither Prophets nor Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles nor Chriſt himſelf knew any Thing of it:—And indeed 'tis ſo groſs, that the Patrons of this Doctrine themſelves are aſhamed to own it, tho' they hold it in Effect.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſhut up this Point with the Inſtance of Capt. <hi>Roger Clap,</hi> one of the ancient Settlers of this Country,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:005926_0030_10276DBBA835C708"/>
who in reciting his Chriſtian Experiences gives this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. — <q>In former Times I do remember, there was <hi>a young Man</hi> came into the Congregation where I was, a <hi>Stranger</hi> to me, and a very hard favoured Man; I had no love to his Perſon; but not loog after I heard, that he <hi>fear'd GOD;</hi> and upon the very Report thereof, my Heart was knit unto him, altho' I never ſpake with him as I know of.</q>—He mentions this, as one Evidence of his own Converſion, &amp; not of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of that other Man. — He and other Chriſtians of old judged by their outward Fruit only, and did not make their <hi>Feeling</hi> any <hi>Evidence</hi> at all concerning others: It appears by their Writings, that they were Strangers to the Doctrine now advanced.</p>
            <p>Here it will be proper to anſwer ſome Objections;</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some ſay, If we are to judge by the outward Fruits only, then we may be deceived; we may take a Hypocrite for a true Chriſtian, and have Communion with him as ſuch; and if ſo, then there is Communion between Light and Darkneſs, a Concord between <hi>Chriſt</hi> &amp; <hi>Belial,</hi> which cannot be.</p>
            <p>In Anſwer hereto I would aſk, Whether <hi>David</hi> had not Communion with <hi>Abithophel, Samuel</hi> with <hi>Eliab,</hi> and the Apoſtles with <hi>Judas!</hi> And have not the Saints, that come to the Lord's Table, ſome Communion with Hypocrites, that approach to that Ordinance? — True Chriſtians have Communion with Hypocrites upon this Suppoſition, that they are <hi>good Men;</hi> they communicate with them in what is good, and in nothing that is bad; for they know nothing of that: But there is no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion (only external) on the Hypocrite's Part, becauſe their Hearts are not right in the Sight of GOD; they are not capable Subjects of it; — and upon their diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering themſelves, the Communion ceaſes on the Saint's Part too; He then withdraws from him as a <hi>diſorderly
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:005926_0031_10276DC203FBF178"/>
Walker:</hi> The <hi>good Appearance</hi> upon which the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was built vaniſhes; and then he will have nothing to do with him. — Here can be no Concord between <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Belial,</hi> becauſe it is the <hi>Appearance</hi> of Good that draws the Hearts of the Saints, and it laſts no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than that laſts: The Appearance of the cloven Foot ſeperates them.</p>
            <p>This Matter may be illuſtrated by this Compariſon: Suppoſe there ſhould a Stranger come among us, that pretended to be a good Subject to King <hi>George,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved like one, we ſhould communicate with him as a Fellow-Subject; but if afterwards he ſhould diſcover himſelf to be for the <hi>Pretender</hi> or the King of <hi>France,</hi> we ſhould withdraw from him as a vile Wretch: Here we ſhould have no Communion with him in his <hi>Treaſons,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we were ignorant what he was, while we aſſociat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis objected, that if our Hearts may be drawn out towards an Hypocrite, then <hi>Love to the Brethren</hi> is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Sign of our Adoption; if we cannot infallibly know who are <hi>Brethren,</hi> we cannot <hi>love</hi> any as ſuch: Conſequently we may be deceived every Way.</p>
            <p>Chriſt himſelf anſwers this Objection, when he ſays, Mat. 10.41. <hi>He that receiveth a Prophet in the Name of a Prophet, ſhall receive a Prophet's Reward; and he that receiveth a righteous Man in the Name of a righteous Man, ſhall receive a righteous Man's Reward.</hi> — that is, ſays Mr. <hi>Pool,</hi> "If they have been ſincere in their Deſigns &amp; Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they ſhall not loſe their Reward, tho' the <hi>Prophet</hi> or <hi>righteous Man</hi> ſo entertain'd prove but an <hi>Impoſtor.</hi>" Their receiving of ſuch a one upon his good Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance out of Reſpect to Chriſt, was as good an Evidence to them as if he had been really good, and their Reward ſhall be as great. — This Inſtance may ſet the Matter in a fair Light: — Suppoſe one of your Relations whom
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:005926_0032_10276DC961A649D0"/>
you loved, ſhould go beyond Sea, and ſhould live there many Years; and at laſt one ſhould come to ſee you who called himſelf his Son, and ſhould appear to you honeſt and ſincere in his Profeſſions and Account, and likewiſe bore ſome outward Reſemblance of your old Friend; and upon it you ſhould entertain him joyfully upon the Account of his Father, whom you ſtill had a great Value for:—Suppoſe this Perſon ſhould at laſt turn out a Cheat, and not be what he pretended; yet your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving him would be a good an Evidence to you of the Reality of your Love, as if it had been his real Son.—</p>
            <p n="3">3.

            <p>That Text is urged, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Having a Form of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but denying the Power thereof; from ſuch turn away.</hi>— From whence 'tis infer'd, that Chriſtians have ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Standard by which they can infallibly diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Formaliſt &amp; the true Chriſtian, or between the <hi>Form</hi> and the <hi>Power;</hi> and this is no other than this <hi>inward Feeling;</hi> all external <hi>Signs</hi> being uncertain.</p>

Feeling,</hi> but ſtill makes their <hi>outward Fruits and Practices</hi> the Standard to judge by.—This is more evident ſtill from what follows, <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, 'Tis ſaid, that if Believers don't all receive this Doctrine, 'tis becauſe they are in the dark, &amp; God's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is withdrawn from them.—If we plead againſt this Error, &amp; endeavour to convince them by Scripture, this is the common Anſwer, <hi>Aye, you are in the dark, or you would ſee as we do.</hi> — I readily acknowlege, that thoſe Believers in the <hi>dark,</hi> who are not in the Exerciſe of <hi>divine Love</hi> or <hi>Charity,</hi> &amp; other Graces; but this is no Sign of <hi>Darkneſs</hi> their denying this to be the <hi>Standard</hi> of judging others:— Their <hi>Love to the Brethren</hi> may be as ſtrong &amp; ſervent at ſuch a Time, as the <hi>Love</hi> of thoſe of the oppoſite Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:— All the Difference between them lies in this, the one look upon it only as an Evidence of their own good Eſtate, and the other as an Evidence both for themſelves and others.—And here we appeal to the Law and to the Teſtimony.—<hi>The Lord knoweth them that are his,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.19. But Man knoweth not. Here I can't but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Policy of Satan in this <hi>Plea;</hi> as long as he can make Perſons believe it, they will become impenetrable to Conviction, and muſt of Neceſſity remain ſtaked down in their <hi>Errors,</hi> 'till God himſelf open their Eyes without uſing the <hi>Inſtrumentality</hi> of Man:—For who will receive even the <hi>Truth</hi> it ſelf from one whom he looks upon to be in the <hi>dark,</hi> and not capable of judging of it in his preſent Frame?—Oh beware of this <hi>Device of Satan,</hi> &amp; take heed <hi>leſt he get an Advantage againſt you.</hi> 2 Cor. 2.11.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, my Brethren, I beſeech you, that we may hear no more of this <hi>new</hi> &amp; <hi>unſcriptural</hi> Doctrine:— I am confident that if you belong to GOD, you will one Time or other be thankful for this Diſcourſe, tho' it may be it is not pleaſing to you now.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:005926_0035_10276DCF5805C7C0"/>The remaining OBSERVATIONS I muſt be brief in.</p>
            <p>The fourth OBSERVATION is, That <hi>ſeeing</hi> TARES <hi>in the Church, is Matter of Grief to the Servants of Chriſt.</hi>— This is imply'd in the Text.</p>
            <p>They are greatly affected at the <hi>Ignorance</hi> &amp; <hi>Scandals</hi> of Profeſſors, and are often ready to cry out with <hi>David, Wo is me that I ſojourn in Meſhech, and that my Dwelling is in the Tents of Kedar.</hi>—Oh that theſe Tares were weeded, that <hi>Iſhmael</hi> were caſt out of Doors, ſo that <hi>Sarah</hi> and her Son <hi>Iſaac</hi> might live in Peace!</p>
            <p>This leads me to a,</p>
            <p n="5">V. OBSERVATION, <hi>Hence ſometimes they are ſo offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious as to offer their Service to purge the Church. The Servants ſaid unto him, wilt thou that we go and gather up theſe Tares?</hi> v. 28.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This proceeds partly from <hi>Zeal,</hi> and <hi>Love to God.</hi> They act with <hi>good Views,</hi> tho' upon <hi>miſtaken Principles:</hi>— They verily think that GOD's Glory will be promoted thereby; hence their <hi>Love</hi> to him prompts them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.—They have truly <hi>a Zeal for God;</hi> but it is <hi>not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. This proceeds partly from <hi>ſpiritual Pride.</hi> There is a Mixture of good and bad in the beſt Saints; <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> will remain together, 'till Death.— And among other corrupt Principles, <hi>Pride</hi> is the chief: This is the firſt Sin that lives, and the laſt that dies; 'tis a Weed that grows in the beſt Soil; and it generally prevails <hi>moſt,</hi> when we ſee it <hi>leaſt.—Young Converts</hi> are eſpecially prone to this Sin; they think that they know more, and can do better, than GOD knows they can: For want of <hi>Experience</hi> they are apt to <hi>out-run</hi> themſelves; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if they have been <hi>applauded</hi> by others for their <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Graces,</hi> as has been the Caſe too frequently: This makes them aſſuming and confident, and to treat all as Enemies, that oppoſe any of their darling Notions.
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:005926_0036_10276DDB695A1328"/>
Thus it is in the Inſtance before us: <hi>Spiritual Pride</hi> makes them think, that 'tis one of the eaſieſt Things in the World to know another's ſpiritual State: and 'tis nothing but Time and better Experience, that will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them they are wrong, and make them more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.—In the mean Time they are all on Fire for <hi>purging</hi> the Church. But,</p>
            <p n="6">VI. <hi>An Attempt to do this is very dipleaſing to the Lord</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>who ſees Men's Inſufficiency for this Work.</hi> This is my next OBSERVATION. <hi>Nay,</hi> ſays he, <hi>leſt while ye gather up the Tares, ye root up the Wheat alſo.</hi>— Men could not purge the Church of Hypocrites, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Danger of putting out ſuch as were true and ſincere, eſpecially if they were in a <hi>low</hi> Frame.—<hi>Therefore let them both alone 'till the Harveſt:</hi> "Thereby intimating (ſays Mr. <hi>Flavel</hi>) both the difficulty of diſtinguiſhing <hi>Tares</hi> from the <hi>Wheat;</hi> as alſo the unwarrantable Raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of bold and haſty Cenſures of Men's Sincerity and Hypocriſy, which is there ſhadowed by them."</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, Does not Chriſt command us in other Scriptures to caſt out the <hi>Tares?</hi> How then can this be true Doctrine, that ſuch are to be tolerated in the Church? I anſwer, If <hi>Hereſy</hi> or <hi>moral Scandal</hi> can be proved upon any of our Fellow-Members at the Mouth of two or three credible Witneſſes, by the Laws of Chriſt they are to be caſt out of the Church, unleſs they repent and reform: If this be not done, the Church would be quickly turn'd into a <hi>Sty,</hi> or <hi>Cage of unclean Birds.</hi>—But ſuch muſt not be rooted out, as have ſuch a Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to <hi>Wheat</hi> from the outward Appearance, that they cannot be rooted out, without an Hazard of a miſtake, and a rooting up the Wheat with them.—As <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

Church Proceſs againſt them, and caſt them off.—Chriſt frowns upon this in our Text, and elſewhere.—There are ſo many <hi>Tares</hi> appearing at Times, even in GOD's own People, that the beſt of us are utterly inſufficient for this Work, and ſhall root up <hi>Tares</hi> and <hi>Wheat</hi> together, if we pretend to go about it. —We want not only a <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> but fit <hi>Qualifications</hi> for ſuch a Service as this.—</p>
            <p>I am perſwaded that this Doctrine of the <hi>infallible Knowledge, the denying of the uſe of Means to Sinners, as Prayer,</hi> &amp;c. are <hi>Tares</hi> ſow'd by the <hi>evil One</hi> at this Day, to bring a Blemiſh on the <hi>Reformation,</hi> and to harden Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in their Wickedneſs: But I verily believe if <hi>all</hi> thoſe who hold ſuch Principles ſhould be caſt out of the Church, the <hi>Wheat</hi> would be rooted up with the <hi>Tares:</hi> For tho' theſe <hi>Doctrines</hi> are <hi>Tares,</hi> their <hi>Perſons</hi> may be <hi>Wheat;</hi> theſe <hi>Errors</hi> not being <hi>Fundamental.</hi>—But my Text does not ſpeak of <hi>Tares</hi> in this Senſe:—And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may juſtly endeavour to root out ſuch corrupt Principles, and not let them continue 'till the <hi>Harveſt,</hi> if we can prevent it; leſt they be Bitterneſs in the latter End; leſt the <hi>Works</hi> of ſuch Men <hi>be burnt up,</hi> and <hi>they themſelves ſaved</hi> only <hi>ſo as by Fire,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.15. Oh that this Sermon may be bleſt for that End! My Brethren, I beſeech you not to take Chriſt's Work out of his Hands; no longer pretend to ſuch a <hi>Spirit of Diſcerning;</hi> no more attempt in this Manner to ſeperate the <hi>good Seed</hi> and <hi>bad;</hi> for your Shoulders are too weak for the Buſineſs, and you will make wild Steerage in it, whatever you may think; but leave the Matter with Chriſt.—If the Leaven of your ſpiritual Pride was once <hi>purged</hi> out, we ſhould hear no more of <hi>purging</hi> the Church in this Sort; but you would only endeavour to do it in a private bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Way, by Chriſtian Admonition and Reproof, by ſetting a good Example <hi>&amp;c.</hi> before thoſe whom you
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:005926_0038_10276DE0318FE590"/>
fear to be Hypocrites.—This would do as much real Service to the Cauſe of Chriſt, as your preſent Principles and Practices do Diſſervice to it, tho' you ſee it not.—</p>
            <p>Hence ſee the Groundleſsneſs of <hi>ſeparating</hi> from a Church, meerly becauſe we have Reaſon to fear there are many <hi>Tares</hi> in it.</p>
            <p>There never will be a Church upon Earth, that will be entirely free from ſuch <hi>Tares:</hi> Chriſt hath told us the contrary.—And ſhall we ſeparate from all Churches?— <hi>A Separation from Corruptions,</hi> and <hi>a Separation from thoſe that are corrupt,</hi> are two diſtinct Things; the one may be, where the other is not; the former is always a Duty, but not the latter.—As long as we keep our ſelves free from other Profeſſors Sins, 'twill be no Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to us to communicate with them, if we cannot <hi>regularly</hi> get them caſt out.—They muſt bear their own Puniſhment whoever they be; and we ſhall be free from their Blood, if we give them faithful Warning in a <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate</hi> Chriſtian Way.—God's Ordinances muſt not be forſaken, becauſe Hypocrites come, and <hi>

Uſually <hi>Lazineſs,</hi> ſays Dr. <hi>Manton,</hi> is the Ground of Separation; Men are both to diſcharge their Duty, to take Pains, to convince, exhort, and warn their Fellow-Members; and therefore they run into ſeperate Aſſemblies, where all Things may be carried on more eaſy.—Oh examine your ſelves, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not thus among you?—'Tis ſtrange that any ſhould ſeparate from One that is acknowleged to be a true Miniſter of Chriſt, and from many faithful Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, becauſe all the Church are not ſo pure as they

            <p>I anſwer, Such Texts are to be underſtood in a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative</hi> Senſe, or they can't be reconciled with many Places in the New-Teſtament.—The Sum of what is here promiſed is this; That the Church under the Goſpel, eſpecially in the latter Days, ſhould be purer than that of the <hi>Jews,</hi> (which was <hi>National,</hi> and where ſometimes

it may be ſcarce one in ten Thouſand were true Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and where alſo many <hi>Strangers</hi> of other Nations join'd themſelves to them, and were circumciſed out of politick ſelfiſh Views;) they ſhould be much freer from corrupt Mixtures than they:—But theſe Places can't be underſtood in the moſt <hi>abſolute</hi> and unlimited Senſe; becauſe Chriſt hath told us in our Text, that <hi>Tares and Wheat ſhall be together 'till the Harveſt;</hi> and in Mat. 25. that <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>fooliſh Virgins</hi> ſhould be intermix'd, 'till his <hi>Coming.</hi>—If we reject this Interpretation, we ſhall make the Scriptures claſh and contradict themſelves, which cannot be. But if we ſhould ſuppoſe from thoſe Texts, that the Church is to be <hi>almoſt</hi> wholly pure in the glorious <hi>Millennian</hi> Days; yet the Scripture gives us no Ground to think, that it will be bro't about by <hi>purging</hi> the Church in the Manner ſome plead, for, or by <hi>ſeparating</hi> from other Churches; but by the <hi>almoſt</hi> general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> of the <hi>Hypocrite</hi> and the <hi>Profane,</hi> and bringing them into one Fold.—So that ſuch Texts taken in the largeſt Latitude, give not the leaſt Warrant to the <hi>ſeparating Principles and Practices</hi> that now prevail among you.—</p>
            <p>Therefore, my Brethren, take Heed to your ſelves, left Satan beguile you, and lead you out of the right Way.—Don't <hi>wreſt</hi> the Scriptures to make them ſpeak your <hi>Senſe,</hi> but ſtudy them impartially, and pray for the Spirit that he may rightly unfold them to you.—Beware of <hi>ſpiritual Pride,</hi> the Mother of Contention and undue Separation:—Watch againſt thoſe who make it their Work <hi>to draw away Diſciples after them</hi> —Have not Mens Perſons too much in Admiration, left you impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly receive all they ſay as Goſpel, without due Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and deſpiſe others that are better than they, as the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Chriſtians did.—Labour in the Strength of Chriſt for daily Progreſs in the Work of Mortification:

The leſs <hi>carnal</hi> we are, the leſs Contention &amp; Dividing will be among us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. "<hi>Separation</hi> is uſually, but very abſurdly, accounted an <hi>high grown Chriſtian</hi>"— In a Word, <hi>Follow Peace and Holineſs, without which no Man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſeventh and laſt OBSERVATION is, <hi>But a Time of Separation between the</hi> Tares and Wheat will come, <hi>in the great Harveſt-Day, at the End of the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord hath two Ways of <hi>cleanſing</hi> his Church in this World —He doth it partly by the <hi>Preaching</hi> of the Word, which is the Lord's Inſtrument for <hi>rooting</hi> out Hypocrites, <hi>i. e.</hi> by making them true Chriſtians. He doth it alſo by the ſurprizing Diſcovery he ſometimes makes of ſecret Villany before all Men.—GOD often plucks off the Vizard of Hypocrites, of <hi>falſe Teachers</hi> and <hi>Seducers</hi> eſpecially; and they appear to others in their proper Hue.—<hi>Their Wickedneſs is ſhewed before the whole Congregation,</hi> Prov. 26.26. The Lord diſcovers it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by ſome <hi>trying Judgment,</hi> or <hi>ſcandalous Fall.</hi>—So that the Church are obliged to caſt them forth as rotten Members, and to cut them off as <hi>dead Branches,</hi> Joh. 15.2.—"I verily believe, ſays a pious Divine, That one great Deſign of all <hi>GOD's Providences</hi> towards his Church, is to diſcover the <hi>Rottenneſs</hi> and <hi>Hypocriſy</hi> of <hi>falſe Friends</hi> of Chriſt."—<hi>All the Churches ſhall know, that I am He which ſearcheth the Reins and Hearts; and I will give unto every one of you according to your Works,</hi> Rev. 2.23. But after all, the Church will never be fully <hi>cleanſed,</hi> 'till the great Day:— Some Hypocrites no doubt, continue undiſcover'd 'till the laſt; they go off fairly to our Apprehenſions, and get to Hell by a private Way: The Day will diſcover many Miſtakes and wrong Gueſſes, that were made by the moſt <hi>diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Chriſtians.—But then, Chriſt will come with his <hi>Fan,</hi> and thoro'ly <hi>purge his Floor,</hi> Mat. 3.12.

            </p>
            <p>Is it a Truth, that <hi>Hypocrites</hi> infeſt the pureſt Church? Hence let us all ſtrictly enquire, whether we are of that Number or not.—When Chriſt warn'd the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> of a <hi>Hypocrite</hi> among them, every one of them cry'd out, <hi>Lord, is it I! Lord is it I!</hi>—Let us go and do likewiſe.</p>
            <p>My Brethren, how ſtands the Caſe with you? Are you truly united to Chriſt? Have you been beaten off by an Almighty Power from all Confidence in your Selves, and your own Works; and been bro't to acquieſce in, to be well pleaſed with, and to venture your Souls upon, GOD's Plan of Salvation thro' <hi>Jeſus Chriſt?</hi>—Has Chriſt the Supremacy in your Souls? Do you love and ſeek him for <hi>himſelf?</hi> Do you take up your eternal <hi>Reſt</hi> in him, and in him alone? Is your Treaſure in Heaven, and your Hearts there?—Do you really hate all Sin, ſecret as well as open? Are you willing to part with every Luſt, without Exception; and to comply with every Duty the Lord hath enjoin'd?—Do you make Conſcience of <hi>ſecret</hi> Duties, as well as of thoſe that are <hi>open;</hi> and can't you content your ſelves without <hi>real ſenſible Communion</hi> with GOD in Duty?—And do you
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:005926_0043_10276DF6633CE790"/>
engage in the Service of GOD with Complacency and Delight, or is it a Taſk and Burden to you?—Do you act from <hi>Chriſt</hi> as your <hi>Principle,</hi> and to Chriſt as your End? Is he the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> in all you do; or is it <hi>Self</hi> that you are ſeeking?—Do you live as under the <hi>Eye of GOD,</hi> and ſet Him always before you? And are you willing to come to the Light, &amp; to have your Deeds proved thereby?—Do you make Religion your <hi>main,</hi> or only a <hi>by-Buſineſs?</hi>—Do you walk <hi>humbly with</hi> GOD, being <hi>poor in Spirit,</hi> and <hi>lowly</hi> in your own Eyes? Or are you puffed up with <hi>Self-Conceit!</hi> Do you bleſs GOD for the Grace imparted to others; and rejoyce if any Deſign for Chriſt be carry'd on by other Hands, tho' your Honour be eclipſed thereby; or at leaſt, tho' you have no Share in the Credit of it?—And is it as a Dagger to your Heart to ſee the Intereſt of Chriſt lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing and declining in the World?—And do you chearfully <hi>take up your Croſs,</hi> and follow Chriſt, in <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,</hi> as well as in <hi>Doing?</hi>—Had you rather endure the <hi>greateſt</hi> Sufferings, than fall into the <hi>leaſt</hi> Sin?</p>
            <p>My Hearers, Theſe are <hi>trying</hi> Queſtions; and can you ſtand the Teſt? Can you ſay, It is thus with you?— Oh deceive not your ſelves, but ſearch and ſee:—Every <hi>Grace</hi> has it's <hi>Counterfeit,</hi> as you have heard; therefore bring your ſelves to the <hi>Touchſtone,</hi> and try thoro'ly what <hi>Metal</hi> you are of.—Thou canſt not indeed diſcern the Difference many Times between <hi>common</hi> and <hi>ſpecial</hi> Grace in <hi>another;</hi> but thou mayſt in thy <hi>ſelf:</hi> And wilt thou not make Enquiry?—Within a little while GOD will bring you to his Bar, and then all <hi>falſe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verings</hi> will fail you:—Is it not therefore better to know the worſt of your ſelves here? <hi>Then</hi> it will be too late; but <hi>now</hi> a Remedy is to be had.—Oh let nothing ſhort of a <hi>Judgment of Certainty</hi> content you, with Reſpect to the good Eſtate of your precious and immortal Souls.</p>
