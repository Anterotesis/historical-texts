            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>THE following <hi>Production,</hi> (the reſult of much reading, reflection, and conſiderable experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.) contains Obſervations on the ſituations, cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates and ſeaſons in which <hi>Remitting</hi> or <hi>Bilious Fevers</hi> are moſt prevalent; the cauſes from whence they originate, the circumſtances which render them epidemic; remarks on Sydenham's doctrine of the influence of conſtitutions or conditions of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere. An examination of the queſtion, whether Intermittents or Remittents are contagious or not; and a compariſon of their diſtinguiſhing ſymptoms, with thoſe of the Contagious Fever, commonly called the Yellow Fever, which has occaſioned ſo much mortality and diſtreſs, in different ſea-port towns of the United States of America, ſince the year 1793. With a deſcription of the Remitting Fever as it appears in Philadelphia; and the method of treatment which the Author has experienced to be moſt ſucceſsful.</p>
            <p>An Abſtract is alſo annexed of the opinions and obſervations of almoſt all the phyſicians, that have practiſed in different ages, and in different climates, which have come to the Author's know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that he thinks worthy of notice; the object of which, is to furniſh thoſe at a diſtance from pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic libraries, with a compendious and connected view of every thing intereſting, that has been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, and that lies ſcattered in a multitude of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes on the ſubject; free from the perverſions of falacious and miſleading theory, or the misrepreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:033590_0003_0FF793B6D53FB280"/>
of uncharitable, and diſtorting party ſpirit. He therefore expects that this part of the ſubject at leaſt, will afford the diſcerning and judicious reader, both pleaſure and profit.</p>
            <p>The experienced Lind,<note n="*" place="bottom">2nd. Paper on Inſection at page 79.</note> was of opinion, that a judicious ſynopſis, or abſtract of the writings on fevers, in a chronological ſeries, would be a valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble work, as it would contain treaſures of uſeful knowledge in a ſmall compaſs, provided facts and naked truths diſengaged from conjecture, or hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis were only ret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ined.</p>
            <p>In ſuch a work we might contemplate under one view, the principal advances which have been made towards a more complete knowledge of fevers, and a more ſucceſsful method of treating them, from the firſt records of the healing art, to the preſent period. Such a work would alſo aſſiſt us, in judging how far hypotheſes and pre-conceived opinions, (which teach by rule to ſtray) have retarded its progreſs, and advancement. It would alſo enable us to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh the deductions, and concluſions drawn from experience and obſervation, thoſe pillars of certainty and truth, from thoſe derived from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, or miſtaken facts.</p>
            <p>An appendix is alſo added, exhibiting facts and reflections relative to the ſynochus icteroides or yellow fever.</p>
            <p>How the Author has executed his deſign, muſt be determined by thoſe who are competent judges of the ſubject, but he flatters himſelf, that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality and fidelity with which he has endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to execute it, will have the effect of ſoften<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cenſure, which its defects may merit.</p>

               <hi>OBSERVATIONS</hi> ON BILIOUS FEVERS.</head>
            <p>FEVERS are termed bilious, when at their commencement, or during their progreſs, a greater quantity of bile is ſecreted and excreted than in time of health.</p>
            <p>Fevers in which a preternatural or exceſſive ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and excretion of bile, is a characteriſtic ſymptom, have always more or leſs of a remiſſion with reſpect to the violence of the feveriſh ſymptoms once in every twenty-four hours; this remiſſion in the greateſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of caſes takes place every day in the forenoon, and the feveriſh ſymptoms begin to encreaſe about noon, or imitating the type or form of what is called a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tertian ague, the remiſſion comes on one day in the forenoon, and the next in the afternoon; or alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately one day in the afternoon, and the next in the forenoon.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>BILIOUS FEVERS,</head>
               <p>Or fevers of the remitting kind accompanied with bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious evacuations, prevail more univerſally than any other kind, and although they are not ſo dangerous, or mortal, as peſtilence or typhus, yet from the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſality of their ſway, and the frequency of their oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence they deſtroy greater numbers in a courſe of years, than any other kind or form of fever.</p>
               <p>During, or ſoon after the periodical rainy ſeaſons of the torrid zone, eſpecially where the ſoil is moiſt and
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:033590_0005_0FF793BC73F24378"/>
unſheltered from the parching rays of a vertical ſun, and abounds with putrefying vegetable and animal ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. Fevers of a remitting type with reternatural excretions of bile, often occaſion mortality almoſt equal to that of the Aſiatic plague.</p>
               <p>This fever not only deſtroys the majority of new ſettlers in ſuch ſituations, but renders <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he conſtitutions of thoſe who eſcape with life, infirm the remainder of their days.</p>
               <p>In many parts of Europe, particularly where the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation is flat, and the ſoil moiſt, this fiend ſtretches his baneful ſcepter over the ſickening land, the whole autumnal ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>Along the Tyber in Italy, and on the flat grounds of Hungary in Germany, where the ſummers are long, and the heat extreme, bilious remitting fevers are the moſt fatal in the catalogue of diſeaſes. Holland, which is little better than an extenſive moraſs, though ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated ſo far north, is periodically viſited by the bilious fever. It alſo extends its ſway to many parts of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Ireland. Nor is the continent of North America exempt from its baneful power.</p>
               <p>Throughout all the low grounds from Canada to Florida, this diſtemper infeſts the country at ſtated periods.</p>
               <p>That the bilious fever is only a variety of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting fever, altered in its aſpect and ſymptoms by climate, ſeaſon, ſoil, and the ſenſible qualities of the atmoſphere, &amp;c. is rendered certain, from its prevailing in ſimilar ſituations and ſtates of the weather in all countries.</p>
               <p>Thus, in the low grounds of ſome of the Provinces of Germany, thoſe fevers which owe their origin to the effluvia derived from a moiſt and putrid ſoil, appear in the form of ſimple tertians, or diſtinct quotidians, while in Hungary where the ground is more level, and the atmoſphere almoſt motionleſs for want of hills to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct the winds, the fever produced by the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations, appears in the form of a remittent, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant ſymptoms and exceſſive bilious evacuations, which in its progreſs, unleſs ſpeedily relieved by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:033590_0006_0FF793BF8A4906B0"/>
or art, degenerates into a ſtate of extreme debility, and diſplays ſymptoms exactly like thoſe of the moſt malignant typhus, or putrid fever as it is commonly called, occaſioned by contagion.</p>
               <p>In Italy, a fever the ſame in kind, but differing in degree of violence, often appears in the ſhape of a double tertian, or irregular remittent, and is often at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in its progreſs with pitechiae or purple ſpots, and apthous ulcerations in the mouth and fauces.</p>
               <p>In Holland the ſame occaſional or efficient cauſe, produces a fever with diſtinct intermiſſions every, or every third day.</p>
               <p>In Ethiopia, and in all that tract of country from Sues to Babel Mondel, it gives the diſeaſe the ſemblance of the peſtilence in its moſt malignant form.</p>
               <p>In America, as well as in other countries, the fevers which are occaſioned by the air of marſhes, or the effluvia of putrefying vegetable or animal ſubſtances, are amazingly influenced in their aſpect and ſymptoms, by the ſoil, ſituation, climate, ſeaſon; and by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding and preſent qualities of the atmoſphere, and the cuſtomary mode of living of the inhabitants.</p>
               <p>In the nothern ſtates, fevers from the recited cauſe, are ſeldom epidemic, though caſes of remitting fever are by no means rare in thoſe ſtates, in marſhy ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions during the autumnal months, but they moſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the form of intermittents. In the middle ſtates remittents with bilious evacuations are very common, but ſeldom very complicated or malignant, except when the preceding ſpring and ſummer have been moiſt and ſultry. Neither dry and hot, or wet and cool ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, have been obſerved to render this kind of fever either general or malignant: On the contrary, when it does occur after ſuch ſeaſons, it is generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with an inflammatory diatheſis, and requires blood-letting and purging, repeated as often as the ſymptoms reſume any appearance of violence, as well as the ſtrict obſervance of the antiphlogiſtic regimen, to reduce it to its natural and ſimple form. But in Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia, North and South Carolina, and Georgia, where the heat is more intenſe, and the ſoil more putrid, along
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:033590_0007_0FF793C126C72F60"/>
the ſhores and ouzy banks of large rivers and ponds of ſtagnant water, particularly after the rice harveſt in September and October, when an extenſive ſurface of moiſt ſoil is expoſed to the piercing rays of the ſun, a fever of the remitting kind is generated, which exhibits ſymptoms of alarming debility and malignancy; and yet, there is not one inſtance on record, of this fever however malignant and mortal it may have been to the perſons affected by it, ever being contagious, or of having communicated a fever diſtinguiſhed by the ſame aſſemblage of ſymptoms, from one perſon to another.</p>
               <p>The authorities quoted by Dr. Ruſh, of its being contagious in other parts of the world, ſhall be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in the courſe of theſe obſervations.</p>
               <p>From the influence of climate and ſituation upon the conſtitutions of the inhabitants, it is reaſonable to expect, that a diverſity in the treatment of the ſame diſeaſe would be requiſite. The ſuggeſtions of reaſon are in this inſtance, ſupported by the obſervations of authors of the moſt extenſive experience and ſagacity; among theſe may be mentioned, Baglivi, Ziminerman, Pringle, Tiſſot; and of more recent date, Lind, Bruce, and Jackſon.</p>
               <p>That diſeaſes the ſame in kind, differing only in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, require not only a treatment differing in degree, but in kind, we learn from the medical writers of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent countries.</p>
               <p>Thus we are informed, that the inhabitants of France bear bleeding without injury, and often with evident benefit, in almoſt every form of fever that occurs there; while in Italy it is thought to do injury in almoſt every caſe of fever. Emetics, and other evacuants, agree with the conſtitutions of the Germans, while ſudorifics and cordials ſuit beſt to animate and warm the phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic Hollander.</p>
               <p>Bliſters, volatiles, aromatics and wine, are of uſe in the remiſſions of the fevers that prevail in the autumnal ſeaſon in the ſouth of Europe, as well as in the ſouthern ſtates of America, during every period of the diſeaſe. But in the northern ſtates they are ſeldom admiſſible,

               <p>Phyſicians ſhould therefore always compare the cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and ſoil of the country where an author has been in habits of making his obſervations, with thoſe of his own, before he ſubmits to be governed by his rules or advice.—Unleſs he does this, he will be at a loſs to know whether the practice of the author he may have occaſion to conſult, will apply to the diſeaſes where he reſides or not.</p>
               <p>It alſo requires great caution as well as diſcernment, to avoid being miſled by the plauſible theories of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative and fanciful authors. For inſtance, who, after reading in one of thoſe authors, that every fever owes its exiſtence and continuance to a ſtate of debility; that it is aggravated by debilitating powers, and that purgatives of every ſpecies are debilitating powers, would venture to employ a medicine of this claſs, in the cure of any kind of fever? Yet in hot climates, where extreme and conſtant heat, and a variety of other circumſtances, are ſaid to be conſtantly conſpiring to encreaſe the ſuppoſed cauſe of the diſeaſe (debility,) there is nothing more common, nothing more benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, than the frequent employment of mild purges in remitting bilious fevers.</p>
               <p>Or who that reads, that a convulſive ſtate of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries is the proximate cauſe of every fever, whether, peſtilential, typhus, intermittent, or remittent, and that copious blood-letting and purging are the beſt remedies in one variety of fever ariſing from the ſame origin, viz. ſtimulus with all the other varieties, would heſitate to employ the ſame remedies without meaſure or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, in every form that can poſſibly occur.</p>
               <p>Intermittent and remittent fevers, as well as fevers accompanied with local affections, are greatly influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, not only by the climate and ſoil, but by the ſeaſon and ſenſible qualities of the atmoſphere.</p>
               <p>Sir John Pringle remarks, that "In Holland towards June, (a healthy month;) Inflammatory fevers begin to recede, and that bilious remitting and malignant
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:033590_0009_0FF793C7A72F95F0"/>
fevers often ſucceed, and continue throughout the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and autumn, until the return of winter, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory fevers recommence; the ſeaſons and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes interchanging and running into each other."</p>
               <p>Dr. Monro relates, that "The firſt time he ſaw much of the remitting fever in Germany, was about the end of June, ſoon after the army took the field. At that time the remiſſions were ſhort, and the fever partook much of the nature of the common inflammatory fever, and moſt of the ſick were cured by blood letting, and other antiphlogiſtic remedies.</p>
               <p>"After the middle of June, the fever did not partake near ſo much of the inflammatory nature as before;— the remiſſions became much more evident, and it was attended much oftner in the beginning with bilious vomitting and purging, and in ſome few the diſorder turned to a dyſentery.</p>
               <p>"A few had it changed into a continued putrid fever, from the wards in one of the hoſpitals being too much crowded—and in ſome few it terminated in regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar agues. In November ſeveral were taken ill of the remitting fever in the garriſon of Bremen, which moſtly ended in a regular intermittent, the endemic diſtemper of the place."</p>
               <p>"In June 1762, the remitting fever began to appear again among the troops at Natzungen, and continued to be frequent through the ſummer and autumn. The greateſt part terminated this year in regular agues, moſtly in tertians, and were cured by the bark, whereas the year before, very few terminated this way."</p>
               <p>(This is a clear proof of the influence of climate and ſoil upon the conſtitution, and of the power of conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution in modifying diſeaſe.) "Moſt of thoſe ill of this fever, had a yellowiſh colour of the countenance, which went off with the fever; in ſome more obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than in others; in general it was ſlight; ſome few become yellow all over."</p>
               <p>Dr. Pringle has alſo taken notice of this yellowneſs ſometimes occuring in caſes of remitting fever, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, that it was found more frequent during the firſt campaign, than afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="unknown:033590_0010_0FF793C93AC82820"/>Dr. Lind, the moſt experienced phyſician of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent age in febrile diſeaſes, relates, that "The years 1765 and 1766, were diſtinguiſhed by an uncommon appearance of intermitting and remitting fevers in moſt parts of England, one obvious cauſe of this was the unuſual frequency of the eaſterly wind, (which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what it is in America is always dry and hot in that climate.)</p>
               <p>"The year 1765 was remarkable, not only for the long continuance of eaſterly winds, but alſo for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary degree of heat: In the month of Auguſt, the thermometer was often as high as 82° in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the day. This conſiderable addition of heat, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the want of refreſhing rains, greatly ſpread this fever, increaſed its violence, and in many caſes changed its form.</p>
               <p>"The violence of the fever, with its appearances in an intermitting, remitting, or a continued form, mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as it were the nature of the ſoil.—In Portſmouth, its ſymptoms were bad, worſe at Kingſton, and ſtill more violent and dangerous in a ſtreet called the half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way-houſe, where the ſituation of the houſes are low and damp.</p>
               <p>"A conſtant pain and giddineſs of the head, were the moſt inſeparable and diſtreſſing ſymptoms of this diſeaſe: ſome were delirious; and a few vomitted up a quantity of bile, and in all, the countenance was yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. The univerſality of this fever, together with its uncommon ſymptoms, were at firſt alarming; but when the lancet was withheld, and the bark given ple<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tifully in large doſes few died.</p>
               <p>"The diſeaſe decreaſed with the heat of the weather, and in the <hi>winter</hi> appeared chiefly in the form of a quartan ague<note n="*" place="bottom">(Lind on Diſeaſes of Hot Climates, Edit. 2d. p. 25.)</note>."</p>
               <p>We learn from the Obſervations of Dr. R. Jackſon in his treatiſe on the Fevers of Jamaica, that the ſeaſon of the year has conſiderable effect upon the diatheſis of the ſyſtem, and conſequently upon the type, or form of
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:033590_0011_0FF793CB8DD1A8A0"/>
the fever, even within the tropics. Thus in the dry ſeaſon (from December to April) though the remiſſions are not always more perfect, the type is commonly more ſimple, and the general diatheſis more inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory. In the rainy months, remiſſions are more diſtinct, but the type is more complicated, and the general dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis has a ſtrong tendency to putreſcency, and often with ſymptoms of nervous affection. The ſtomach, bowels and liver, likewiſe ſuffer more in this ſeaſon than in the dryer months of the year. Beſides this difference which ariſes from ſeaſon, we alſo find very conſtant effects from local ſituation. Thus in hilly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricts there is more of the inflammatory diatheſis, with more frequent determination to the head and lungs, and leſs diſtinct remiſſions than in flat and champaign countries, where the ſtomach and biliary ſyſtem ſuffer in a remarkable manner."</p>
               <p>This effect of ſeaſon and ſoil, is ſtill more remarkable in the intermitting or remitting fever of the United States of America. In the ſpring and beginning of ſummer, the double tertian or remitting fever, is the moſt uſual type of fever in the marſhy tracts, and low grounds, in every part of the Union, and the remiſſions are ſhort and imperfect.</p>
               <p>In the months of Auguſt and September, and part of October, quotidians, and fevers with very imperfect and obſcure remiſſions are more prevalent than any other forms or types. As the autumn advances, ſingle tertians and remittents, with inflammatory ſymptoms become moſt prevalent.</p>
               <p>Beſides the changes, produced in the type and ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of fevers produced by the air of marſhes, or the effluvia of putrefying vegetable ſubſtances by the change of ſeaſon, and the condition of the ſoil, climate has a conſiderable effect upon it—For on York-Iſland, the type is generally, even in the heat of ſummer, ſingle tertian. In Georgia, the ſingle tertian is the prevailing type only in the winter and ſpring.</p>
               <p>In ſummer and part of autumn, double tertians are common; and types of a ſtill more complicated kind frequently make their appearance in certain ſituations
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:033590_0012_0FF793CFC780DA48"/>
of all the ſouthern ſtates. Dyſentery, dropſy, and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers accompanied with malignant ſymptoms, are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe more frequent in the ſouthern, than in the eaſtern or middle ſtates; and the courſe of the fever in the former in general, is more certainly checked in its early ſtage by the Peruvian bark, than in the latter.</p>
               <p>Virginia lies about half way between New-York and Savannah, and the general effects of its climate on the common endemic of the country, correſponds in a great meaſure with its local ſituation. Deviations from the tertian type are more frequent here than in New-York, but leſs ſo than in Georgia.</p>
               <p>SPORADIC CASES of remitting fever occur at Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, in the ſpring, and early part of ſummer. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thoſe ſeaſons, they are generally accompanied with inflammatory ſymptoms, and the remiſſions are very imperfect and obſcure for the firſt three or four days, after which they become more evident, and in a few days more, unleſs prevented by improper treatment or conduct, change to complete intermittents, which are readily removed by the uſe of the bark.</p>
               <p>In the caſes which occur in the vernal and ſummer ſeaſons, bilious ſymptoms are ſeldom obſervable, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept at the acceſſion of the fever, or with thoſe ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms which uſher it in.</p>
               <p>Nauſea and occaſional puking, are common at the acceſſion of every ſpecies of fever, whether inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, nervous, or intermitting: Under theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances more or leſs bile is generally ejected, but as this is merely the effect, and not the cauſe of the vomiting, and as the evacuation of bile in any form or variety of remitting fever, is only a ſymptom, and not a cauſe of the diſeaſe, there is no propriety in naming the fever bilious, in which it only occaſionally and under parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, or accidental circumſtances becomes a predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſymptom. With the ſame propriety it might be denominated inflammatory in thoſe caſes where the pulſe is ſtrong and quick, the ſkin hot and dry during
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:033590_0013_0FF793D277F59B78"/>
the exacerbations, though the remiſſions be regular and diſtinct.</p>
               <p>In both forms the fever is derived from the ſame occaſional cauſe, miaſmata, operating on conſtitutions, differing only in diatheſis.</p>
               <p>The paroxiſms of pure intermitting fevers are always finiſhed in leſs than twenty-four hours;—ſo likewiſe in remitting fevers, though the hot and ſweating ſtages of the paroxiſm do not entirely ceaſe before the expiration of twenty-four hours from the acceſſion of each pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxiſm; they always ſuffer before that time, a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able abatement or remiſſion of their violence; and at the ſame period every day, or every other day, a paroxiſm is in ſome ſhape renewed, which runs the ſame courſe as before.</p>
               <p>When it happens, and in certain circumſtances this is often the caſe, eſpecially in an advanced ſtate of this fever, that the remiſſion is imperfect, is perhaps with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſenſible perſpiration, and that the returning parox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm is not marked by the moſt uſual ſymptoms of a cold ſtage, but chiefly by the aggravation or exacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of a hot ſtage, it is difficult to diſtinguiſh the diſeaſe from that ſpecies of fever denominated typhus, occaſioned by contagion, or human effluvia.—But if theſe have paſſed from an intermitting or remitting form, to that of a continued one, and ſtill ſhew ſome tendency to become intermittent once a-day, or at leaſt every ſecond day, and there is no foundation to ſuſpect expoſure to contagion or human effluvia, and if they have but one paroxiſm in the courſe of twenty-four hours, they certainly ought to be conſidered and treated as remittents. For "Continued fevers which ariſe from contagion, ſhew little tendency to become intermittent or remittent, in any part of their courſe, and eſpecially after the firſt week of their continuance, and have pretty conſtantly an exacerbation, and remiſſion twice in the courſe of every twenty-four hours."<note n="*" place="bottom">Cullens Practice of Phyſic, p. 73d, ſect. 29, publiſhed by Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theram with notes in 1791.</note>

               <p>Inflammatory topical affections are very apt to occur during the ſeaſon when remittents and intermittents are prevalent, upon any ſudden change of weather to a colder ſtate; particularly after rain has continued for three or four days, which is very common at, or ſoon after the autumnal equinox. In theſe caſes, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions of pain and fever are more obſervable every morning, than when they occur in winter or ſpring; which evinces that they are either connected with the cauſe of common intermittents, or that the conſtitutions of people are diſpoſed, at that ſeaſon to take on an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termittent or remittent form, notwithſtanding the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the ſtimulus of inflammation.</p>
               <p>When the ſmall pox becomes prevalent, either in the natural way or by inoculation at the ſame ſeaſon, the fever with which it is accompanied frequently aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes the remittent form.

               <p>The celebrated Sydenham (who, by the by, was a very erroneous philoſopher) miſled by vague and erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous notions, reſpecting influential conſtitutions of the atmoſphere (which he aſcribed to ſome ſecret and inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable alteration in the bowels of the earth, or to the influence of the planets;<note n="*" place="bottom">See his Letter to Dr. Goodall, in his whole works tranſlat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Swan, ad.

<pb n="12" facs="unknown:033590_0015_0FF793D5A0790CA0"/>
ſmall pox or plague prevailed: "For theſe," ſays he, "either baniſhed all other diſeaſes, or compelled them to wear their livery; that is, they aſſumed their type, and leading ſymptoms, and required the ſame kind of treatment:—An opinion totally incompatible with facts and later obſervations. An author of more modern date, from confounding epidemics derived from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion, with thoſe from ſeaſon, and ſoil, has alſo fallen into the ſame error."</p>
               <p>It has been, and is ſtill the opinion of ſeveral phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians of reſpectability, not only in Philadelphia, but alſo in Baltimore, New York, and Boſton, that the contagious yellow fever which has prevailed during the ſummer and autumnal months, in ſeveral of the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port towns of America, ſince the year 179<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, is the ſame in kind, differing only in degree with the common bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious remittent; and becauſe the ſeaſon was dry, and uniformly warm when it prevailed at Philadelphia in 1793; its contagious quality was aſcribed to that cauſe, and when it prevailed at New York in 1795, becauſe the weather was remarkably wet at that time, it was as prepoſterouſly aſcribed to that circumſtance.</p>
               <p>It is not only rational to ſuppoſe, but many facts favour the opinion, that when no other diſeaſe appears in the place where a contagious diſeaſe prevails, that the ſeaſon or ſenſible qualities of the air, or exhalations from the ſoil at that time, are not favourable to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of the diſeaſes uſually endemic at that ſeaſon. It is impoſſible that the contagion ſhould have the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of baniſhing them, as it can have no effect upon the quality of the air, to any extent from the bodies of thoſe with the diſeaſe. Facts relative to the ſtate of the weather at New York in the autumn of 1795, and at Philadelphia the preſent year, viz. 1797, which were wetter and cooler than many preceding ſeaſons had been, as well as thoſe contained in almoſt every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern medical author, eſtabliſh this.</p>
               <p>It is merely owing to a change in the ſenſible qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of the air, or to the removal of the various efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via, or impurities with which it is occaſionally mixed, that one epidemic ſucceeds or takes place of another,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:033590_0016_0FF793D9CED6D7E8"/>
and not to the influence of one epidemic over another. For example: In the warm and impure air of autumn, when intermittents prevail, pleuriſies are rare, but on the approach of winter the intermittents decline, and pleuriſies increaſe. Is this owing to the influence of the one diſeaſe over the other, or is it owing to a change in the ſenſible qualities of the air? That fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brile diſeaſes derived from contagion, and thoſe from marſh effluvia, often prevail in the ſame place, and at the ſame time, is known to every perſon acquainted with medical hiſtory. Even Sydenham has recorded inſtances, (though they contradict his doctrine of occult cauſes) of ſeveral diſeaſes different in kind, being epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic in the ſame place at the ſame time <note n="*" place="bottom">See his Account of the Epidemic Conſtitution of 1670, 71, and 72, at page 142, Edit. 3d. tranſlated by Swan.</note>. Change of ſeaſon always baniſhes ſome kinds of diſeaſe, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours the generation and propagation of others. This is ſo ſimple and obvious, that none but a man wedded to the moſt extravagant theory, would have looked into the bowels of the earth, or up to the ſtars for the cauſe.</p>
               <p>When however I reflect that philoſophy was only beginning to emerge from gothic darkneſs, in which it had long been ſunk, at the time Sydenham publiſhed his obſervations; I am willing to make due allowance for his errors:—But the preſent aera, when philoſophy has arrived at a ſtate of improvement, which approaches to perfection, ſuch errors are not entitled to the ſame toleration.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now tranſcribe a few remarks from other au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities, which will remove every doubt, that two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious diſeaſes, different in kind, may prevail in the ſame place at the ſame time. Examples of this kind are mentioned by the experienced Dr. Lind, in his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations on the Diſeaſes incidental to Europeans in Hot Climates, page 126, 5th Edit: And Ruſſel on the Plague, at page 24 and 48, relates that the remitting fever prevailed at Aleppo in Auguſt 1760, when the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:033590_0017_0FF793DCC9DD8B10"/>
plague was on the decline, and in November 1761, the plague and the ſmall pox prevailed there at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>Mertins in his Hiſtory of the plague at Moſcow in 1771, at page 186 gives ſimilar examples.</p>
               <p>Dr. Maximillian Plinta has publiſhed an Account of the Scarlet Fever and Hooping Cough, being preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent at Elangen in the year 1790, at the ſame time with an epidemic ſmall pox. Diſeaſes of various deſcription alſo came under the notice of ſeveral phyſicians in Philadelphia, during the prevalence of the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant yellow fever in 179<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. Several caſes of ſmall pox came under the care of Dr. Deveze, and Dr. Duffield, at Buſh Hill hoſpital, which were ſent out of the city previous to the eruption, from ſuſpicion of their having the malignant yellow fever.</p>
               <p>Several caſes of the ſame kind came under my own notice: A Mr. Quinton from New England, died of the ſmall pox, at Mrs. Newark's in Spruce ſtreet at the time, when two of her other lodgers had the yellow fever.—Several caſes of quotidians and tertains came under my care in different parts of the city, and in the ſuburbs, where the contagion never reached.</p>
               <p>The ſame diſeaſe prevailed in the ſummer and part of the autumn of 1794, at Fell's Point, adjoining Balti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more; at which time the ſmall pox alſo became epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mic, as appears by the report of the Committee of Health, and a letter from Dr. Buchannan, dated Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the 11th, 1794, publiſhed in the Gazette of the U.

               <p>Dr. Monſon, in his account of the yellow fever which prevailed at New Haven in 1794, ſays the ſcarletina prevailed at the ſame time, and that a greater number of perſons were affected with the ſcarletina, than with the yellow fever; ſee his letter to Noah Webſter, Eſq. page 179 of Webſter's Collection on Bilious Fevers.</p>
               <p>In the preſent year alſo, I ſaw ſeveral caſes of ſcarlet fever, and of the ſmall pox, in the ſame part of the city where the malignant fever was moſt prevalent, and one caſe of the latter, in the ſame chamber with two other patients, ill of the malignant fever.</p>

From the facts on record re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the plague, it appears that a certain range of temperature is requiſite for the contagion, by which it is propagated, to operate: Hence it would appear that the peſtilential contagion is attached to, and rendered volatile to a certain extent, by a certain quantity of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loric or matter of heat, or is attenuated and diffuſed by the action of ſenſible heat, like water converted into va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour, ſo as to be ſpecifically lighter than the air near the ſurface of the ground.

               <p>It has become faſhionable in this city, to call every fever bilious, that occurs in the ſummer and autumn, whether accompanied with a preternatural ſecretion and effuſion of bile or not.

                  <hi>OF THE CAUSES</hi> OF BILIOUS FEVERS.</head>
               <p>FROM the numerous obſervations which have been made in different quarters of the world, there can be no doubt, that the cauſe of the fevers under conſideration, is a miaſma or exhalation, which iſſues from a marſhy or putrid ſoil, or from putrefying vegetable and animal ſubſtances. The ſimilarity in the ſeaſon, ſituation, and ſoil, in the different countries and diſtricts in which theſe kind of fevers prevail, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the time of the year in which they are moſt epidemic and dangerous, concur in proving that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſymptoms may vary in different ſituations and conſtitutions, they ariſe from one common cauſe, and that cauſe is miaſma.</p>
               <p>This miaſma is ſuppoſed to partake of the nature of the putrid ſource from whence it is derived, but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever its nature may be, it exiſts in the atmoſphere over the ſoil or putrefying ſubſtances, from whence it ariſes in various quantities, and perhaps degrees of ſtrength, according to the climate, ſeaſon, temperature of the air, and quantity of putrid matter. Hence in tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate climates in the hot ſeaſon, it is in leſs quantity or in leſs ſtrength, than in hotter climates with a ſimilar ſoil. In hot climates alſo, the heat and impurity of the air, favours its operation, by inducing debility and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural irritability in the animal ſyſtem. In tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate climates the difference between the temperature of
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:033590_0021_0FF793E7587162A0"/>
the air of the days and nights, render the body more eſpecially liable to be affected by febrile miaſmata.</p>
               <p>Why theſe miaſmata when diffuſed abroad in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere of marſhy diſtricts, do not produce fever in all the inhabitants within the ſphere of its influence, or why ſome are affected by it much later than others, can only be explained by ſuppoſing that it can only operate on relaxed, infirm, or debilitated conſtitutions, and that ſome debilitating cauſe muſt conſpire with it, before it can produce any morbid effect in vigorous and robuſt conſtitutions. This appears to be confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by its effects on the emigrants from Ireland, which generally arrive in this country the beginning of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt. Very few are affected with either the remitting or intermitting fever the firſt ſeaſon, though numbers are with the dyſentery, whereas very few of thoſe that take up their reſidence in the ſuburbs of Philadelphia, eſcape it the ſecond or third ſeaſon after their arrival: but many are affected the firſt ſeaſon of their arrival with infflammatory fever, eſpecially if the ſeaſon be dry and hot,—if wet and cool, the dyſentery. This is alſo the caſe with perſons who come to reſide in the city, from the weſtern and hilly parts of Pennſylvania.</p>
               <p>Mud and ſtagnant water in every climate, poſſeſs the materials which give origin to the cauſe of this ſpecies of diſeaſe; but a combination of other circumſtances is requiſite to give it activity. Among the principal of the circumſtances which give activity to this cauſe, may be reckoned the influence of a powerful ſun. Hence ſome ſituations, which in the winter ſeaſon are diſtinguiſhed for no particular diſeaſe, are obſerved in the hot months to be moſt remarkably unhealthful.</p>
               <p>There are few men whoſe obſervations are ſo circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, as not to know, that it is in the neighbourhood of ſwamps, mill-dams, and near the ſhores of freſh water rivers, that intermittents and remittents chiefly prevail; yet it deſerves likewiſe to be remarked, that though a fever of one of theſe forms is moſt prevalent in ſuch ſituations, no champaign or level country is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely exempt from them, eſpecially when wet ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers are ſucceeded by dry and ſultry autumns.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="unknown:033590_0022_0FF793E8F77F4680"/>Freſh cleared land in level countries, is rendered much more unhealthful for ſome time, than when co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with wood. The reaſon is obvious; the wood not only ſtops the progreſs of noxious vapours carried from a diſtance, but it alſo covers and protects the ground from the immediate action of the ſun; in doing which it more than counterbalances the leſs free circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the air, or the greater dampneſs of the ground. Hence no opinion is more erroneous, than that the clearing a country of its woods, renders it healthful. Unleſs the grounds be drained and cultivated as well as cleared, the effect is likely to be the reverſe.</p>

               <p>IT would be a matter of utility could we determine which certainty to what diſtance from their ſource, the noxious effluvia of marſhes extend. But this is a queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which we can not expect to aſcertain with preciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. It is not uniformly the ſame in all ſituations, depending perhaps on the concentrated ſtate of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halation, at its ſource, the obſtacles it meets with in its progreſs, and the nature of the ground over which it paſſes, or to which it is directed. Dr. Jackſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, that he has known their influence very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able at the diſtance of a mile and a half, on the top of an hill of very conſiderable elevation. (p. 412.)</p>
               <p>The ſame author, as well as the experienced Lind, late phyſician to Haſlar Hoſpital, remarks, that a ſpace of time almoſt conſtantly intervenes, after expoſure to the noxious effluvia of marſhes, before the ſubſequent ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of fever. "This is not uniformly the ſame in all perſons, owing ſometimes perhaps to the ſtate of concentration, in which the exhalation is applied to the body, or to the peculiar aptitude of the individual, to favour or reſiſt its operation."—Both the laſt mentioned authors agree, that the fever ſeldom attacks in leſs than ſeven
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:033590_0023_0FF793EAACD74B38"/>
days after expoſure to the noxious effluvia, and Dr. Jackſon ſays, that he oftner obſerved it to attack four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen days after ſuch expoſure. (p. 415.)</p>
               <p>The nature of this cauſe of fever, though it has long been a ſubject of enquiry remains ſtill unknown.</p>
               <p>From the greater violence of the fever produced by it, as well as the complexety, and often malignity of its ſymptoms in ſoils the moſt putrid, during the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumnal ſeaſon, we infer that the exhalation is in the largeſt quantity, and has acquired a greater degree of power, or that the atmoſphere with which it is mixed, is by ſome means deprived of its correcting power. But we have hitherto been able to proceed no farther, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the aids which modern chemiſtry has fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</p>
               <p>It has been ſuppoſed, (and the ſuppoſition was adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the celebrated Dr. Cullen,) to poſſeſs a <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Some other quality perhaps is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore connected with it, which cannot be brought under the inſpection of our ſenſes. But though the ingenuity of the human mind, has not hitherto been able to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the intimate nature of this cauſe of fever, we ſtill have it in our power to trace its effects upon the human conſtitution.</p>
               <p>We plainly perceive that a habitual expoſure to it, is peculiarly unfriendly to the <hi>principle</hi> of <hi>life,</hi> and in a very remarkable manner, ſhortens the period of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence. Hence, as recorded by Dr. Jackſon, while fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males born, and conſtantly reſiding in the the low lands of Georgia, have ſeldom been obſerved to live beyond the age of forty, males ſeldom exceed fifty, whereas Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans or Americans from the northern ſtates, who had arrived at manhood before they ſettled there, have ſometimes lived to a very advanced age, though the majority of new ſettlers have died, of what is called a ſeaſoning to the climate, the firſt or ſecond year after their arrival.</p>
               <p>Though theſe and other inſtances which will occur to every ones recollection, afford ſufficient proofs of the

noxious quality and power of marſh effluvia, yet we are by no means inſtructed as to the manner by which it becomes ſo. It will therefore profit but little, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute the subject any farther.</p>
               <p>Certain limits are unqueſtionably preſcribed to human reſearches, on the preſent ſubject, beyond which, though fancy may take its ſlight, and theory make wide excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, all is conjecture, obſcurity, or profound dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>Floods of rain, by diluting and precipitating putrid exhalations, relieve from the remitting bilious fevers, common to marſhy ſituations; but rain has no effect upon the yellow fever, except when joined with cold, or ſucceeded by froſt.</p>

               <head>AN EXAMINATION OF THE <hi>EVIDENCES RESPECTING THE</hi> CONTAGIOUS NATURE OF INTERMITTENT <hi>&amp;</hi> REMITTENT FEVERS</head>
               <p>IT has been ſaid that it is ſcarcely poſſible to open a practical book on medical ſubjects, without meeting with facts which eſtabliſh the opinion, that fevers occaſioned by the exhalations from putrid vegetables are contagious. The fevers generated by putrid cabbage, mentioned by Dr. Rodgers, and by putrid flax men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by Dr. Zimmerman, were both of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious. Lanciſi, Reverius, Bianchi, Cleghorn, Lind of Windſor, and Clark, have alſo been quoted in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of this opinion.—All of which ſhall be noticed in the ſequel.</p>
               <p>That Dr. Rodgers of Cork, was deceived with reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the origin of the fever which broke out at Wadham College, is rendered more than probable by the obſervations of the celebrated Lind of Haſlar Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital. This author informs us in his Eſſay on Fevers and Infection, page 290, that almoſt all the caſes of fever which occur at academies and boarding-ſchools are derived from infection; and that moſt caſes of low fever which occur in private families are derived from the ſame ſource. Dr. Cullen has expreſſed a ſimilar opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which has been adopted by Robertſon, Clark, Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riar, and a numerous hoſt of authors of the firſt rate abilities.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="unknown:033590_0027_0FF793F5B5CD5C78"/>Dr. Zimmerman appears to have confounded epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mic with contagious diſeaſes; nor ſhould this be thought extraordinary, for notwithſtanding his abilities and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, he has been frequently miſtaken in his opinion reſpecting the remote cauſes of other diſeaſes. Among other miſtakes, he ſays the ſcurvy is propagated by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion,<note n="*" place="bottom">Experience in Phyſic, page 125 of Vol. 2nd.</note> and that putrid fevers are occaſioned by the exhalations from putrid animal ſubſtances, and the plague at Grand Cairo, by the ſtench from ſwarms of dead and putrid graſshoppers and locuſts.<note n="†" place="bottom">Mead on the Plague, ſays it originates from heat and moiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, acting on dead animal matter, which is alſo erroneous. In the Eaſt, says he, it can be generated in this manner, but not in the temperate climates of Europe. If that were the caſe the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe would be propagated by the atmoſphere, to a certain extent, to numbers at once, and not from one to another in ſucceſſion.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Lanciſi who was phyſician to Pope Clement XI. was ſo much miſtaken in the real cauſes of diſeaſes, that he aſcribed the peſtilence which prevailed more or leſs at Grand Cairo annually, to the effluvia of hemp and flax, which happened to be ſtored in granaries near that city, at a time when the diſeaſe was more general than uſual; he has alſo aſcribed a fever which depopulated one end of Rome, to the putrid effluvia from <hi>horſes lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> or ſtable dung.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Vol. 1ſt. page 350.</note>
               </p>
               <p>That the plague never originates in that way, but is derived from ſpecific contagion, generated in the cities of the Eaſt, is clearly ſhown in Mead's Short Diſcourſe on the Plague, publiſhed in the year 1721, and in Ruſſel's treatiſe on the ſame, publiſhed in the year 1791. The other opinion of Lanciſi, viz. that one end of Rome was depopulated by a fever, which originated from the putrid effluvia of horſes litter, &amp;c. Profeſſor Ruſh has refuſed in the 2nd Vol. of the American Philoſophical Tranſactions, page 211 and 212: Theſe are his words. "Offal matters, eſpecially thoſe which are of a vegetable nature, ſhould be removed from the
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:033590_0028_0FF793F750CD6828"/>
neighbourhood of a dwelling houſe. The <hi>dung of domeſtic animals,</hi> during its progreſs towards manure, may be excepted from this <hi>direction.</hi> Nature which made man and theſe <hi>animals</hi> equally neceſſary to each others ſubſiſtence, has kindly prevented any inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience from their living together. On the contrary, to repay the huſbandman for affording ſhelter to theſe <hi>uſeful</hi> and <hi>helpleſs</hi> animals; nature has done more: She has endowed their dung with a power of deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the effects of marſh exhalations, and of preventing fevers. The miſerable cottagers in Europe who live under the ſame roof, and in ſome inſtances in the ſame room with their cattle are always healthy.<note n="*" place="bottom">Is this owing to the dung of thoſe animals, or to the purity of the air from other ſources, counteracting or deſtroying the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſcent quality of theſe exhalations?</note> In Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, fevers are leſs known in the neighbourhood of livery ſtables, than in any other part of the city. I could mention a family that has lived near thirty years near a livery ſtable, in a ſickly part of the city, that has never known a fever but from the ſmall pox or meaſles."</p>
               <p>Dr. Zimmerman has indeed ſaid, that "the effluvia from a little heap of flax has been known to occaſion a malignant fever, which proved fatal to the family in which it began, and afterwards ſpread its contagion through a whole country." But it does not appear from this paragraph, whether he meant that the exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation from the flax, or the fever from the family ſpread its contagion through a whole country. This can only be determined by reference to the original, which I have not had an opportunity of examining, and it is ſeldom that a tranſlation conveys the preciſe meaning of the author. He has not mentioned whether the diſeaſe, which he ſays was occaſioned by the exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from the putrid flax, attacked a number at the ſame time, or in ſucceſſion, as they came within the ſphere of contagion, that is within ſix or eight feet of the patient, for it has been aſcertained by Dr. Haygath of Cheſter, that even the contagion of the ſmall pox is
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:033590_0029_0FF793FB0AAF9498"/>
innoxious at that diſtance, where a free circulation of air is preſerved.</p>
               <p>If the facts mentioned by Dr. Zimmerman were true, the human race might literally work out their ſalvation with fear and trembling, ſince none of woman born, could poſſibly ſurvive one hot ſummer; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, "a little heap of putrid flax," ſhould be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there are always apples rotting on the ground, putrid cabbage in the garden, turnips, potatoes, onions, or other vegetables in vaults or cellars,—and bilge water on ſhipboard.</p>
               <p>As to Dr. Rogers it appears evident that he did not know the difference between contagious, and epidemic diſeaſes, for he has aſcribed the former to cauſes which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> only produce epidemics or ſporadics, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious ones. The fevers which prevailed annually at Cork, he ſays were owing to the exhalations of the putrid blood from the ſlaughter-houſes, particularly after the ſummer rains; whereas it is well known (for it has been often obſerved) that ſuch diſeaſes are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in all damp ſituations in the autumnal ſeaſon, where there are no ſlaughter-houſes. The healthineſs of the generality of butcher's families, is oppoſed to his opinion, as well as the healthineſs of the manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers of ſtarch and indigo, where vegetable putrefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion greatly abounds, is to that of vegetable putrefaction occaſioning malignant, much leſs contagious fevers in ſituations open to the free introduction of the ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing air. Unreflecting credulity,—like Shakeſpear's Glendower, is always ready to aſcribe ſimple events to extraordinary cauſes. At my birth, ſays Glendower, ſtrange phaenomena appeared; comets, eclipſes, and rock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the firmament. Percy to ridicule his vain credulity and ſelf-ſufficiency, anſwers, that all theſe phaenomena might alſo have happened at the birth of a kitten: Meaning that there could be no connection between ſuch phaenomena, and the birth of mortals. Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians are too often apt to attribute the cauſe of things to ſome circumſtance moſt obvious to their ſenſes, or to ſome remarkable circumſtance in, or phaenomenon which accompanies or preceeds any
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:033590_0030_0FF793FC9D8023A8"/>
diſeaſe; and for want of tracing all the circumſtances to their ſource, miſtake effects or coincidents for cauſes. Thus in the year 1699, when the yellow fever ceaſed upon the coming on of froſt, becauſe Roger Gill a preacher had offered himſelf ſome time before, as a ſacrifice for the people, and ſoon after died, with others expoſed to the contagion, it was generally aſcribed to a ſpecial interpoſition of Providence, inſtead of being aſcribed to the effect of froſt, which was the phyſical cauſe of its ſuppreſſion. I once ſaw a bodkin thruſt through a hen's head, ſome of the balſam of Riga was applied, the hen walked about ſoon after, and appeared to recover by the virtue of that balſam. Another hen with a bodkin thruſt through her head, to which no balſam was applied, did the ſame and detected the cheat.</p>
               <p>A medical profeſſor, ſays, that Dr. Lind aſcribes the yellow fever to vegetable exhalations, but I can find no ſuch ſentiment in any of Lind's works. His words are (in his Treatiſe of Diſeaſes of Hot Climates, page 119—5th Edition.) This fever in general proceeds from intenſe heat, and a peculiar unhealthfulneſs of the air, but he does not ſay how that unhealthfulneſs of the air is produced. What he has ſaid reſpecting the effects of unwholeſome air at Greenwich hoſpital in Jamaica, has no other reference to the ſubject, than that every kind of fever is ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated by ſuch air, page 179, 5th Edition. The fact is, that Dr. Lind was not acquainted with the ſource of this fever, but miſtook it for a higher grade of the bilious remittent fever, rendered ſo by a peculiar unwholeſomeneſs of the air; but unlucki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for theſe opinions, there are no inſtances of a bilious fever becoming contagious, nor one authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic inſtance where the diſeaſe under conſideration ever occurred in any ſtate of the atmoſphere, without the concurrence of ſpecific contagion.—For proof of this, I refer to the facts contained in Hillary's Diſeaſes of Barbadoes, not to his ſpeculative opinions; Gough's Hiſtory of the Friends; to Dr. Mitchel's Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Dr. Franklin; to Lind on Infection; to Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings

Account of its ſeveral occurrences at Charleſton, in 1732, 1739—45 and—48, where it was each time traced to importation, and when ſome of the ſeaſons in which it occurred, were both cooler and wetter than many which had intervened, or preceded them. The fact is, Lind knew nothing about the diſeaſe but from the report of others, otherwiſe he would not have pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed an extract of a letter from Dr. N. Smith to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the opinion of its being contagious. (See his Eſſay on the means of preſerving the health of ſeamen, &amp;c.) If Lind was right in his opinion, the diſeaſe he ſpeaks of could not be the ſame as the one which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in the Weſt India Iſlands, as well as in Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, in 1793; for it was highly contagious in both places. And in the Weſt Indies affected the natives, as well as foreigners. Not withſtanding the poſitive manner in which the other, Dr. Lind, (now of Windſor) who was ſurgeon to a little ſloop of war, in the ſervice of the Eaſt India Company, has decided on the queſtion, his opportunities were too unfavourable, and his obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations too limited to determine a queſtion of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>Dr. Cleghorn has ſaid, that tertians have as good a right to be called contagious, as the meaſles or ſmall pox, but as he has not mentioned any facts in ſupport of his aſſertion, it can only be conſidered as mere mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of opinion, derived perhaps from hearſay, or the <hi>Ipſe dixit</hi> of ſome profeſſor learned in antient error.</p>

               <p>This author aſſerts that every form and variety of fever belongs to the ſame genus, and is occaſioned by one and the ſame cause, viz. contagion, and that every form and variety is more or leſs contagious according to the ſituation, ſtate of the atmoſphere, and the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution

of the perſon expoſed to the exciting cauſe of the diſeaſe.

               <p>To prove the contagious power of remittents and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termittents, he mentions the following particulars.</p>
               <p>"The Grenville Indiaman which touched at the Iſland of Java, ſuffered greatly from the malignity of the air. A few were taken on board when the ſhip ſailed from <hi>Batavia</hi> ill of a malignant fever, which ſpread by contagion at ſea, and carried off great numbers. I viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeveral (adds our author,) when ſhe arrived at China, who were reduced to mere ſkeletons by the duration of the fever and the dyſentery, both of which were moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly propagated by contagion."</p>
               <p>From Dr. Clark's mentioning his having viſited ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral in this ſhip, after her arrival at <hi>China,</hi> it appears that he was not on board of her at the time he ſays "the diſeaſe ſpread by contagion at ſea," of courſe he could not determine with certainty, whether the diſeaſe was contagious or not.</p>
               <p>Dr. Lind on Diſeaſes of Hot Climates, ſays, "a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may be attacked by a fever ſeveral days after ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure to the exhalations of marſhy grounds. From comparing many inſtances of people, who have ſlept on ſhore during the ſickly ſeaſon, and which <hi>alone</hi> have been taken ill out of the whole ſhips company, then lying in an open road, it appears that ſome are imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſeized with ſickneſs or delirium, many are not ſeized with any complaint till they have been on board for two or three days; several have been only ſlightly indiſpoſed for the firſt five or ſix days; and in a few the ſymptoms of indiſpoſition have not appeared before the tenth or twelfth day.<note n="†" place="bottom">Diſeaſes of Hot Climates, p. 182.

               <p>Dr. R. Jackſon in his late Treatiſe on the intermitting fever of America, aſſures us that fevers produced by the air of marſhes, (or the exhalations from putrid ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable <hi>ſubſtances</hi>) ſeldom if ever make their attack in leſs than ſeven days after ſuch expoſure, and that ſome have been as long even as twenty days after ſuch expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, before the was fever completely formed.</p>
               <p>To ſupport the opinion which he appears to have adopted from Dr. Cleghorn, that common intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents are contagious; Dr. Clark informs us, that an <hi>old lady</hi> with the palſy, who lived up three pair of ſtairs, in a ſituation where no marſh miaſmata could reach her, was attacked with an ague, and as there was no ſource of marſh miaſma, from whence it could have originated it muſt have been occaſioned by contagion. But from whom ſhe received the contagion he has not ſaid.</p>
               <p>From this caſe it appears that Dr. Clark thought, no caſe of <hi>ague</hi> could take place in any ſituation, or from any circumſtance, unleſs the perſon affected had been previouſly expoſed to marſh exhalation, or to the effluvia of a perſon labouring under the diſeaſe. A miſtake which is unpardonable in an author, who pretends to write for the inſtruction of others.</p>
               <p>The fact however is very different from what Dr. Clark has ſuppoſed, for there are a multiplicity of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations upon record, which as well as my own ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, convince me that intermittents often occur in <hi>ſituations</hi> excluded both from marſhes and ſick <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi>
                  <pb n="31" facs="unknown:033590_0034_0FF79406DBD434E0"/>
where patients, after being debilitated by any acute diſeaſe, fall into regular intermittents from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure to the night air, when the dews are copious, or after a ſudden change of weather from dry and hot to wet and cold.—Perhaps this was the caſe with Dr. Clark's patient who was debilitated by a chronic diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. We are alſo told by Dr. Clark, that a decrepid and infirm gentleman, and his ſervant maid were both attacked by an intermittent, for which no cauſe could be aſſigned, but the viſit of another maid ſervant from the country. He knew a child take the ague from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much converſant with a perſon troubled with that diſeaſe—"And a man from only viſiting a friend while ſweating in a tertian." Since the year 1788, adds Dr. Clark, "I have ſeen ſix inſtances of agues communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated from one to another by contagion in the wards of the infirmary at New-Caſtle."</p>
               <p>Theſe may appear unequivocal proofs of the conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious nature of intermittent and remittent fevers, to perſons not aware of the changes which the ſtate of the mind, the ſituation of place, and the change of living, as well as the propenſity to imitation, (which prevails in moſt diſeaſes attended with nervous ſymptoms,) have upon the human body.</p>
               <p>Here Dr. Chalmers obſerves for me, that when one perſon in a family ſickens, and the diſeaſe cannot be removed in a few days, there is nothing more common than for ſome of the attendants to be affected in the ſame way; this gives an alarm to the neighbours, who conclude that the diſeaſe is contagious, though in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, there is nothing more foreign from the truth— for it is generally owing to the ſimilarity of the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions which now prevails in conſequence of climate and ſeaſon, and to greater expoſure than ordinary to the prevailing cauſes. This is particularly the caſe with nurſes and other attendants who are deprived of their cuſtomary reſt and food, when they expoſe themſelves abroad after being debilitated by confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the warmer and more impure air of a ſick-room.</p>

I am convinced that it was a typhus, or a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued fever of a putrid tendency which originates from animal effluvia in a certain ſituation, and was propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by contagion, and was not a genuine remittent, or any fever that was derived from the exhalations of vegetable putrefaction.</p>
               <p>Dr. Ferriar, to whom in abilities and medical ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirements few are ſuperior, entertains an opinion that "all infectious animal <hi>poiſons,</hi> that of the hydropho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia excepted, are formed originally from ſome morbid proceſs in the living human body."</p>

                  <pb n="33" facs="unknown:033590_0036_0FF7940B8CA51368"/>It is now generally admitted (for it has been eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by accurate and repeated obſervations) that the effluvia from the living human body in certain ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whether affected by fever or not, become a poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon capable of producing a diſeaſe in a healthy body which has the power of propagating its likeneſs to others, either from contact or near approach, or by means of other ſubſtances, which have been within the reach of the exhalations from the body of the ſick.</p>
               <p>If it were admitted, that a ſolitary example or two, have occurred of a fever occaſioned by the exhalations of putrid vegetable ſubſtances, occaſioning a fever to thoſe who attended the ſick, and from them to others, it will ſerve very little towards determining the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, unleſs it can be made appear, that the fever thus propagated, was marked by the characteriſtic ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of either an intermittent or remittent, only diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſified by ſeaſon and conſtitution, &amp;c.—For before any thing can be with certainty admitted as the efficient cauſe of an effect, that cauſe muſt not be occaſionally, but conſtantly preſent whenever that effect is produced.</p>

               <p>Baglivi, (who united great ſagacity and indefatiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble induſtry, with ſound judgment,) publiſhed his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations on the prevailing Diſeaſes of Rome in the year 1696, in which he informs us, that remittents were endemic and exceedingly malignant during the ſummer and autumnal months along the ſhores of the Tiber, and the low grounds of the antient Latium, which was in a manner a deſert, overrun with impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, and that in ſeveral parts, particularly about <hi>Oſtia</hi> and <hi>Porta,</hi> the air was ſo unwholeſome, that if any citizen went out and remained there all night, and then

returned to town, he was ſoon after ſeized with a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous fever, commonly called "the <hi>Bad Air Fever."</hi> This fever differed very much both in its ſymptoms, and method of cure from the fevers that ſpring from other cauſes.—It was relieved by bliſters and cordial medicines, but aggravated by blood-letting, &amp;c.

               <p>Baron Vanſwieten tells us, that "double tertians, which imitate continued fevers, and which are often epidemical are not contagious, though they are often attended with exanthemata, gangrenous blotches on the ſurface of the body, ſwellings of the parotids and other ſymptoms of malignity." This he exemplifies by an account of the epidemic fever of 1756, occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the noxious effluvia of marſhes. "Many viſited the ſick at different times; and many of the ſick were removed to families in health at ſome diſtance from the ſphere of the effluvia, and not an inſtance occurred of its being communicated by contagion."<note n="*" place="bottom">Vanſwieten's Commentaries, Vol. 16th. page, 50.</note>

               <p>The celebrated Lind has given an account of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting bilious fever, which was very epidemic and malignant in ſeveral parts of England in the autumn of 1765, accompanied in many caſes with yellowneſs of the eyes and ſkin; but inſtead of imputing it to conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, he expreſsly ſays, the number of the caſes, and the violence and complexity of the ſymptoms marked as it were the nature of the ſoil. At Portſmouth its ſymptoms were bad, worſe at Kingſton, and ſtill more violent and dangerous at a place called the Half-way-Houſe, where the ſituation is remarkably low and damp." That this was only an intermittent diverſified in its ſymptoms, and modefied by ſeaſon and ſoil, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears evident from its continuing to appear a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able part of the enſuing winter in the form of a quartan ague, and from its yielding to the bark in large doſes when it moſt reſembled a continued fever.</p>

He adds that "this circumſtance as well as the remiſſions which occur only once in theſe fevers, in the courſe of twenty-four hours diſtinguiſhes them from the continued fever which has two exacerbations, and perceptible though ſlight remiſſions, twice within the ſame period.

               <p>This is certainly in effect giving up the point, for a diſeaſe changed in its nature, is no longer the ſame that it was originally, but a new diſeaſe. If they are not changed in their nature, and are contagious, they muſt propagate a fever of the ſame character and type with themſelves. But every caſe of fever which originates from febrile contagion, exhibits the type and character of the typhus or continued fever, with nervous or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid ſymptoms.</p>
               <p>When the attendants on patients with an intermitting or remitting fever are attacked with a fever of a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued type, and nervous or putrid ſymptoms, it implies, not that thoſe fevers are contagious, but that a conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious matter has been generated, accumulated, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered active, in conſequence of the ſituation and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the ſick: For it has been often experienced, that contagion has been generated in conſequence of the confinement of healthy perſons in ſituations where the air is confined till it becomes ſaturated with the effluvia iſſuing from their bodies, which are thereby converted into contagion. But this contagion produces a fever of a continued type, and an aſſemblage of ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms which diſtinguiſh it from every other genus, and propagates a fever of the ſame type and aſſemblage of ſymptoms from one to another. But remittents do not produce their likeneſs to perſons expoſed to their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; therefore as remittents they are not contagious.</p>
               <p>To conclude, if fevers become contagious and are communicated from one to another, the diſeaſe caught being ſimilar to the one from which it took its origin; it may be inferred that they depend upon a ſpecific and unaltered contagion,—but if a perſon takes a fever from another, different from the original diſeaſe, it ſhews that a ſpecific contagion has been generated, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely different from that by which the original diſeaſe was produced.</p>

and unventilated ſituations, I do not pretend to deny, but I contend that the contagion ſo generated is of a ſpecific kind, entirely unconnected with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termittent and remittent fever, otherwiſe it would oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion in thoſe expoſed to it, a fever of an intermittent or remittent form; but inſtead of this it always occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions a fever of a continued form capable of being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated in ſucceſſion from one to another.</p>
               <p>That the contagion generated by patients labouring under the recited diſeaſes is not connected with thoſe ſpecies of fever, but entirely independent of them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be rendered certain from the very ſame kind of contagion being frequently generated in ſimilar ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by perſons entirely free from every kind of fever.</p>
               <p>How the exhalations from the living human body in a confined portion of the atmoſpheric air become a poiſon, capable of generating a diſeaſe in a ſound body, diſtinguiſhed by a particular aſſemblage of ſymptoms, I do not pretend to know; but the fact is unqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable.</p>
               <p>Recent and accurate obſervations have not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced me, that febrile contagion is always derived from the living human body, in ſituations deprived of a due proportion of oxygen or pure air; but that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion is rendered more virulent and deleterious in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the extent and duration of the heat to which people in ſuch ſituations are expoſed. This is confirmed by the Account of the Origin of the Yellow Fever, which appeared in the Iſland of Grenada, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the year 1793, publiſhed by Dr. Chiſholm. And of that on board the Buſbridge, Eaſt Indiaman,<note n="*" place="bottom">Annals of Medicine for 1796.</note> in 1792. Noxious effluvia indeed frequently ariſe from putrid animal ſubſtances in confined ſituations. Dr. Monro mentions a remarkable inſtance of this, and ſome later examples are recorded by Mr. St. John. But it does not appear from theſe caſes, that thoſe noxious effluvia produced any ſymptoms reſembling thoſe of putrid or peſtilential fevers: On the contrary,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:033590_0044_0FF79422AA0E5798"/>
they acted as direct ſtimulants, and occaſioned inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory affections, which were not preceded by ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of debility, and which are, entirely different from the effects produced by febrile contagion.</p>
               <p>Let us now advert to the queſtion, relative to the malignant fever being only a higher grade of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon bilious fever which derives its origin from the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluvia of marſhes or putrid vegetable matter. Though it be difficult to convey preciſely in words a deſcription of the ſymptoms which diſtinguiſh the one diſeaſe from the other; their diſcriminating marks not conſiſting ſo much in one or two ſymptoms, as in a certain aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blage of ſeveral, yet when the whole of the ſymptoms of each are compared jointly and ſeverally, the difference is exceedingly clear and evident.</p>
               <p>The malignant yellow fever is diſtinguiſhed at its commencement, from the worſt caſes of the bilious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting fever, by the ſuddenneſs of its attack, ſhortneſs of the cold ſtage, greater ſeverity of pain in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part of the head and eyes, which are alſo more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently inflamed and watery in the former, than in the latter; and eſpecially by the coſtiveneſs or dyſenteric ſtate of the bowels, the excretion of bile, which is a conſtant ſymptom in the bilious fever of hot climates being as invariably deficient at the beginning of the malignant yellow fever; the remiſſions are alſo more obſcure, and the ſkin more dry. The debility in the animal functions is greater, the ſtricture about the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordia more diſtreſſing, the countenance more fluſhed, of a deeper purple colour, and exhibits the appearance of greater miſery and diſtreſs. Dr. Jackſon obſerves, that though the yellow fever appears variouſly in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of different conſtitutions or diatheſes, from its firſt acceſſion, it may generally be diſtinguiſhed from the endemic remittent of the country, not only by the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcureneſs of the remiſſions, but likewiſe by a certain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the eye and countenance, with ſomething unuſually diſagreeable in the feelings, of which words convey an imperfect idea.</p>

                      rendition="simple:additions"/>The malignant yellow fever which prevailed laſt in Philadelphia, differed very conſiderably from the uſual remitting fever in not ſhewing any diſpoſition to puke, except when excited by medicine, before the end of the ſecond, and often not before the beginning of the fourth day.</p>
               <p>The remarkable irritability of the ſtomach in the former, which comes on, in the majority of caſes (when the diſeaſe is permitted to run an uninterrupted courſe) about the third or fourth day, in conſequence of which a conſtant nauſea and retching to vomit, brings up every thing as ſoon as it enters the ſtomach, and is accompanied with a burning heat, and ſenſe of ſoreneſs, deep and frequent ſighing and reſtleſſneſs, diſtinguiſh the yellow fever very materially at this period from the bilious remittent.</p>
               <p>The bilious colour of the ſkin, and the coffee ground, or black vomitings, which frequently occur in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced ſtage of the diſeaſe, may when they both occur, be conſidered as decided and unequivocal marks, which diſtinguiſh this diſeaſe not only from the bilious but from every other form of fever except the plague.</p>
               <p>But the yellow fever does not differ from the bilious fever, only in the circumſtance of contagion, and in the aſpect and ſeverity of its ſymptoms; it differs from it alſo by its ſymptoms being rendered worſe, by ſome of the remedies which are moſt efficacious in the cure of the bilious fever.—Nor are theſe the only circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in which theſe fevers are diſſimilar: The bilious fever occupies more eſpecially marſhy diſtricts, where the inhabitants reſide at a conſiderable diſtance from one another, and invades a number at the ſame time; its cauſe being mixed with a conſiderable portion of the atmoſphere, and its influence ſometimes extending more than a mile from its ſource; it is alſo more or leſs endemic in ſuch ſituations at the ſame ſeaſon annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</p>
               <p>Whereas the yellow fever never appears among the the inhabitants of marſhy countries in temperate cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, but in ſuch climates, when it does occur, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways confined to ſea-port towns, where, on its firſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:033590_0046_0FF79426067C6E50"/>
it has always been traced to one contracted ſpot near to ſome wharf, or foul veſſel.—If it originated from the ſame cauſe as the bilious remittent, every part of the town, where it occurs, would be alike ſubject to the diſeaſe, at the ſame time, or within a few days of each other.—Some would be ſeized in the north and ſouth, ſome in the eaſt and weſt, the centre and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference, at the ſame time; but inſtead of this, the malignant yellow fever every time that it has occurred in this city, (and it has occurred only five times in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the preſent year, in the courſe of the preſent century, and once before, that we have any account of on record or have learned from popular tradition,) has always made its firſt appearance in one circumſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed point, and firſt affected a few individuals who reſided near, or tranſacted buſineſs at that particular point, while every other part of the city has continued perfectly heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, until the diſeaſe has had time to ſpread itſelf by contagion. From thoſe circumſtances, it is evident that the ſeeds of the diſorder do not float in, or mix with the atmoſphere to any extent, but muſt be ſought for in ſome other ſource.</p>
               <p>If we go down to the meadows and marſhes on the flats of the Delaware and the Schuylkill, and look for it among the diſeaſes, which exhalations engender, it is not there. Imagination, and her whimſical daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Theory,</hi> have created ſomething in thoſe places, which they have called its likeneſs; but, the <hi>Sallow Imp</hi> of the marſhes, is the offspring of different parents, and differs eſſentially in its character from the jaundice-eyed fiend, which extends its deſtructive ſway by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion. If we look for it, in the effluvia from the gut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the ſtreets, the heaps of unmoleſted dirt, in the alleys and lanes, the mud and litter with which the wharfs and water ſtreet is too often encumbered, it ſtill eludes our ſearch.

               <head>A DESCRIPTION OF THE <hi>BILIOUS REMITTING</hi> FEVER, AS IT USUALLY APPEARS IN PHILADELPHIA, IN SUMMER <hi>AND AUTUMN.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IN this fever though there is not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete intermiſſion or ceſſation of the febrile ſymptoms, there is an abatement or remiſſion more or leſs evident once in the courſe of every twenty-four hours.</p>
               <p>This fever after being preceded for a day or two, and ſometimes much longer by a diſagreeable ſenſe of languor and debility, uſually attacks between eight and eleven o'clock in the morning with a chilly fit, which after a longer or ſhorter duration, is accompanied with or ſucceeded by the following ſymptoms. Alternate ſenſations of cold and heat, darting and thrilling through the back and limbs, acute pain in the fore part of the head, back and limbs, yawning, ſtretching, reſtleſſneſs, conſtant thirſt, dryneſs and clammineſs of tongue, mouth, and fauces, flatulency, nauſea, and frequent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to puke, ſometimes bringing up bilious matter, and ſometimes voiding it by ſtool. In many caſes the cold ſtage is accompanied with cholera; in others, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when the fever attacks perſons of a phlogiſtic diatheſis, or ſtrongly diſpoſed to local inflammation, it
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:033590_0049_0FF7942E3A366F70"/>
is attended with coſtiveneſs. In theſe caſes however the patient generally has a call to the chair before the commencement of the ſecond paroxiſm. The urine during the cold ſtage is pale, copious and crude; but as ſoon as the hot ſtage is eſtabliſhed, and during its height it becomes high coloured, and during the remiſſion appears thick and cloudy and ſometimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſits a brick-coloured or browniſh mucous ſediment. During the continuance of the hot ſtage, there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a ſenſe of tightneſs and uneaſineſs about the tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax and ſtomach, and more or leſs frequency and uneaſineſs in reſpiration. As the hot ſtage advances the pulſe (which during the preceding ſtage was low, ſmall, quick, contracte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and irregular) becomes freer, fuller, ſtronger; the temporal and carotid arteries throb; the face becomes ſuffuſed with a ſcarlet bluſh; the muſcles of the face diminiſhed during the cold ſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>in ſhrunk, rough, pale and dry before, now becomes diſtended and ſmooth. The ſickneſs and propenſity to puke ſo conſtant and diſtreſſing during the cold ſtage, and alſo during the conflict between the cold and the hot ſtages, before the latter becomes completely eſtabliſhed, now ceaſes; and about four o'clock in the morning ſometimes two or three hours ſooner, but oftner an hour or two later, all the feveriſh ſymptoms begin to remit and continue to decline till the hour of the firſt attack: Then the ſame proceſs is again renewed and the fever runs the ſame courſe as the preceding day; and ſo on every day till it entirely ceaſes, becomes an intermittent or degenerates into a continued form.</p>
               <p>After the ſecond paroxiſm, and ſometimes after the firſt the fever is ſeldom preceded by a cold ſtage, but comes on with ſenſe of languor, reſtleſſneſs, fluſhings of heat, an increaſe of thirſt, and ſome nauſea, or fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulence at ſtomach, and the fever generally continues moderate till four or five o'clock in the afternoon, when it becomes more violent and continues in that ſtate till the morning. In ſome caſes this fever is worſe every ſecond day. It alſo ſometimes makes its firſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack in the evening. In thoſe caſes the paroxiſms are
<pb n="47"
                      facs="unknown:033590_0050_0FF7942FD51F5170"
                      rendition="simple:additions"/>
generally longer, and the remiſſions more obſcure than when it attacks, or when its paroxiſms are renewed in the morning.</p>
               <p>In ſome caſes at the beginning of the fever, ſtomach ſickneſs accompanied with vomiting and diſcharges of bile from the bowels is ſo predomninant, eſpecially in children whoſe ſyſtems are extremely irritable during the ſeaſon when remittents prevail, in conſequence of the ſummer's heat, and often from the effects of teething, that many phyſicians, have ſuppoſed, that a redundancy and depraved ſtate of that fluid was the principal cauſe of the fever, and in infants have confounded it with the cholera infantum: This is, however, a very great error, for vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting, by whatever means excited, if often repeated, with violent efforts, ſcarcely ever fails of forcing bile from the biliary ducts, and ſometimes in enormous quantities. An extraordinary ſecretion of bile in this fever, and in every other, is the effect of great irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the ſtomach, in conjunction with a defect of power in the circulating veſſels on the ſurface of the body; the conſequence of which is, a preternatural de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination to the vena cava, liver, &amp;c. and of courſe the cretion of an extraordinary quantity of bile in a given time.</p>
               <p>During the exacerbation of the fever, there is always more or leſs, head ach, and pain in the back and limbs, and in many caſes delirium, accompanied with much reſtleſſneſs. The face and eyes alſo appear more tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid and lively; the tongue appears at firſt whitiſh and moiſt, or lightly tinged with a ſtreak of yellow. But when the fever has continued for ſeveral days, with an increaſe of debility, it becomes covered with a dark, brown, tough and dry cruſt. In ſome caſes, great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of ſtrength is viſible from the beginning, in others, it decreaſes gradually in the courſe of the fever. The thirſt varies with the riſe and fall of the fever, a bitter taſte is common; a diarrhoea is more frequent than coſtiveneſs—the colour of the urine varies with the riſe, progreſs, and decline of the <hi>paroxiſm</hi>: At the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the paroxiſm it is pale, thin and copious, at the height it is high coloured, ſcanty and cloudy, at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:033590_0051_0FF79431C0821C98"/>
it is ſtill high coloured, but very turbid, and lets fall a ſediment; the heat of the ſkin, alſo varies with each ſtage the of paroxiſm.</p>
               <p>When the diſeaſe has continued for ſeveral days with encreaſing debility, it is common for the ſkin and eyes, to become heavy dull and yellow, and the countenance to appear ghaſtly. In thoſe circumſtances, the pulſe is always weak and exceedingly quick, and the mind af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with delirium of the low kind, commonly called typhomania.—When the diſeaſe has continued without abatement, and eſpecially when the proſtration of ſtrength has become very conſiderable, the ſymptoms frequently become ſo much diverſified in different patients, that the inexperienced, are apt to ſuſpect them to labour under different diſeaſes; ſome are coſtive, others have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant diarrhoea; ſome are chilled by every paſſing gale, while others are refreſhed by the coldeſt air; the ſkin of ſome is conſtantly parched with heat, while others are as conſtantly bathed in ſweat.—But ſymptoms com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to almoſt all at a late period of diſeaſe, are a low, quick pulſe, ghaſtly countenance, ſunk eyes, continual heat and reſtleſſneſs, with ſickneſs, faintneſs, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of ſtrength, at the uſual time of the acceſſion of every freſh paroxiſm; and this ſickneſs, and increaſe of debility, generally laſts from morning till evening, and frequently all night, particularly, every ſecond or third day; after which, there is generally ſome abatement of theſe diſtreſſing and alarming ſymptoms for ſome hours.—If the debility ſtill continues to increaſe, the the pulſe becomes weaker, lower, ſmaller, quicker and more irregular, through every ſtage of the paroxiſm, and the remiſſions become no longer diſcernable, except by greater proſtration of ſtrength, anxiety and reſtleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at one time of the day, (generally about noon) than another. The days on which this fever uſually terminates in health, are the 5th. 7th. 9th. 11th. and 13th. Theſe are alſo the days on which the remiſſions are moſt manifeſt. When this fever terminates favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, the remiſſions become more diſtinct, accompanied with a warm moiſture on the ſkin, and a copious ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the urine, an intermiſſion then ſucceeds, and
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:033590_0052_0FF794382B2960A0"/>
ſtrength gradually returns. In many caſes it terminates unfavourably without the aid of art, but in the preſent improved ſtate of medicine, few die of this fever when judiciouſly treated. When this fever proves mortal, and the ſtrength is nearly exhauſted, the patient, as in the laſt ſtage of other fevers, lies altogether upon his back, and frequently ſlides to the foot of the bed; in this condition, he has always more or leſs twitching of the tendons at the wriſt, and is affected with low deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium, in which he mutters incoherently to himſelf.— His tongue, his teeth, and lips are covered with a dark coloured, ſordid cruſt: His tongue trembles when thruſt forth for inſpection; his eyes appear dull and ſtupid; his ſenſibility, which in the early ſtate of the diſeaſe was too acute, is now the reverſe; his hearing becomes impaired; he doſes with his eyes and mouth half open; he ſees objects indiſtinctly, and clouds ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to hover round him; a ſtupid inſenſibility pervades all his faculties; the ſphincters loſe their retentive power; the faeces and urine paſs off involuntary; and as if lamenting his hopeleſs condition, tears ſteal down his ghaſtly face; the pulſe falters, and only moves in tremors, loſing, on the ſlighteſt preſſure, all motion; a cold and clammy ſweat bedews his torpid limbs, his fingers, his nails, his lips grow purple, his reſpiration becomes interrupted, by a collection of phlegm, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioning a peculiar rattling in the trachia, vulgarly called the death rattle, frequently interrupted by hiccup. Theſe ſymptoms are generally followed ſoon after by death.</p>
               <p>In ſome caſes, this fever is protracted from one to four weeks; in others, it terminates in a perfect inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion in as many days, eſpecially when properly managed. Cold and clammy ſweats are almoſt infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſignals of approaching death, in every ſtage and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of the diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>The whole of the prognoſis may be thus ſummed up. Tone and vigour, or a moderate degree of that ſtate of body, diſtinguiſhed by the name of inflammatory diathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, without local affection, afford the ſureſt ſigns of
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:033590_0053_0FF79439D6C4FAC0"/>
ſafety: Whereas general failure of the powers of life, or irregular determination to organs of importance, are the moſt certain ſigns of danger.</p>
               <p>The ſeaſon of the year, and ſtate of the weather, with reſpect to dryneſs, or moiſture, as well as local ſituation, have conſiderable effect in varying the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, and in determining the mildneſs or violence of this fever. In marſhy and wet ſituations, and dry ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, the caſes which occur about the latter end of ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and beginning of autumn, are generally attended with greater debility, and have much more obſcure and imperfect remiſſions; the general diatheſis of the ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, has alſo a greater tendency to putrefaction, mixed with nervous affection, and ſometimes with ſymptoms of a malignant nature.</p>
               <p>The ſtomach, bowels, and biliary ſyſtem, ſuffer more under theſe circumſtances than at other times. When the ſummer and autumn have been wetter and cooler than uſual, the fever at its commencement, generally partakes of an inflammatory nature, but the remiſſions at firſt are very imperfect, and with difficulty diſcerned, yet with proper management they ſoon become diſtinct and complete.</p>

               <p>THE remitting fever, is diſtinguiſhed from the typhus, or continued fever, by the remiſſions being more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, and by having only one remiſſion in the courſe of every twenty-four hours, whereas the remiſſions in the typhus, though perceptible only to thoſe who pay particular attention to ſymptoms, occur twice in every twenty-four hours. It alſo differs from the typhus at Philadelphia, in being more conſtantly attended with evacuations of bile, by vomit and ſtool. It is produced by a very different cauſe, and is not like that diſeaſe, contagious: In theſe reſpects it alſo differs from the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low fever of the Weſt Indies, as well as in the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:033590_0054_0FF7943B6F8BBCD8"/>
of bile, though it often reſembles that diſeaſe, in occaſioning a yellow colour of the ſkin and eyes of the patient. From the ſemi-tertian, it differs in no eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial reſpect, excepting in the violence of its ſymptoms; the remiſſions in moſt caſes of each, being one day more perfect than another.</p>

               <head>CAUSES WHICH PREDISPOSE TO THE REMITTING FEVER</head>
               <p>THE perſons moſt ſubject to this fever, are the relaxed and debilitated, the delicate and infirm: Perſons thus circumſtanced, expoſed to the occaſional or efficient cauſes of the intermittent fever, contract a remittent, that is a fever of the ſame nature as an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittent, only differing in degree, in conſequence of the difference in conſtitution and prediſpoſition.</p>
               <p>In all caſes of this fever in order to aſcertain whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it partakes moſt of the inflammatory, or nervous diatheſis, the ſtate of all the functions of the body ſhould be carefully examined; for by the prevailing diatheſis as indicated by the ſymptoms, our treatment of the diſeaſe ought to be regulated.</p>
               <p>If the pulſe be either rapid, ſtrong and full, or even low and hard, or tenſe, we may be aſſured that the diſeaſe partakes of an inflammatory nature, and more eſpecially if accompanied with pain of any particular organ.</p>
               <p>But where the pulſe is weak and ſoft, however fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent or quick, and there is a correſponding debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in the animal functions or voluntary muſcles, a contrary diatheſis is always prevalent.</p>
               <p>The pulſe however though generally a good index of the ſtate of the arterial ſyſtem, is ſometimes ſo much affected by paſſions of the mind, by the ſtate of reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and by local affections that we may be miſled, if we truſt to it, without comparing it, with other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances inſeparable from the diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="unknown:033590_0056_0FF7944424B53398"/>By attending to the ſtate of the ſtomach, and of the muſcles ſubſervient to the will, together with the ſtate of the brain, and comparing the condition of each with the pulſe, we may generally form a proper eſtimate of the ſtate of the diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>In forming a judgment of the ſtate of the vis vitae from the ſenſible heat of the body, much caution and diſcernment are requiſite; for, although an increaſe of ſenſible heat always follows an increaſed circulation of the blood, it does not always depend upon the force with which it is impelled by the heart, but is often owing to the obſtruction of perſpiration, whereby the heat is prevented from paſſing off. Nor is the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the pulſe an index of power in the ſyſtem, but the reverſe, excepting when joined with fulneſs or hardneſs.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>PROGNOSIS.</head>
               <p>THE prognoſtics in this as in other fevers, muſt be derived from our knowledge of the cauſes of death in febrile diſorders in general.</p>
               <p>Theſe in the preſent form of fever are to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the ſtate of debility, and the degree of diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered action preſent in the ſeveral functions of the body.</p>
               <p>The ſymptoms which denote a great degree of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in the animal functions, are</p>
               <p n="1">1<hi>ſt.</hi> Weakneſs in performing the voluntary motions, and ſwooning when in an erect poſture.</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi>d.</hi> Imperfect ſenſations.</p>
               <p n="3">3<hi>d.</hi> Typhomania or delirium, accompanied with great debility.</p>
               <p n="4">4<hi>th.</hi> Thoſe which denote a great degree of debility in the natural functions, are foulneſs and dryneſs of the tongue, gums, and fauces; great loſs of appetite; diſtenſion of ſtomach; inſatiable deſire for acids and cold water; involuntary ſtools and urine, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Great debility in the vital functions, is denoted by the lowneſs, ſmallneſs, or emptineſs and quickneſs of
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:033590_0057_0FF7944729C0EB48"/>
the pulſe; hurried, and interrupted reſpiration; op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion at the precordia; reſtleſſneſs; deep, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ſighing; ſunk and inanimate appearance of the eyes and countenance, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to the fluids, danger is denoted by pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiae, or the eruption of livid or purple ſpots; effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of blood under the cuticle; bloody and brown coloured urine; profuſe and obſtinate diarrhoea; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe, weakening, colliquative, or clammy ſweats, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with coldneſs of the extremities, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>BEFORE I proceed to the treatment of this fever, it may not be improper to add that caſes of remitting fever frequently occur, eſpecially in the early part of ſummer and latter part of autumn, in which inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory ſymptoms or marks of high arterial action are predominant; this happens eſpecially when a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably long period of very warm weather is ſucceeded by heavy rains, and a ſudden change of temperature in the atmoſphere. While the atmoſphere continues either uniformly dry and warm, or uniformly wet and cool, fevers are very rare; of this we had ſtriking ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples in the hot and dry ſummer of 1782, and the wet one of 1788.</p>
               <p>The pulſe in ſuch caſes is not only frequent during the paroxiſm, but it is likewiſe quick, hard, and vibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; the heat is often intenſe; the internal functions, and the various ſecretions are conſiderably diſordered, and the whole ſurface of the body appears dry and rough.</p>
               <p>The remiſſion that follows for the moſt part is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, the pulſe frequently retaining, a preternatural quickneſs and hardneſs, and the ſkin ſtill retaining a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable degree of febrile heat. In theſe circumſtances, the excretion of bile is an unuſual ſymptom, and the patient is inclined to be coſtive, till after the preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural and ſtrong action of the arteries, is reduced by depleting remedies. In theſe caſes the head and back ſufferes more ſeverely, than when it appears in any other form.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="unknown:033590_0058_0FF79449E6693C98"/>In this climate, contrary to what occurs within the Tropics, rainy ſummers and autumns, though they do not occaſion the remiſſions always to be more perfect and viſible, they render the type more ſimple, and the diatheſis oftner inflammatory.</p>
               <p>In hot and dry ſeaſons on the contrary, eſpecially from the beginning of Auguſt, to the middle, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to the latter end of September, the fever is uſually blended with ſymptoms of a nervous kind, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly accompanied with bilious evacuations.</p>
               <p>In theſe caſes the mind is much ſeldomer affected during the exacerbations, than in the former: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, however the patient is affected with lively and unruly delirium, ſometimes the delirium only amounts to a ſlight incoherence in the train of ideas, or a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary ſuſpenſion in the power of recollection.</p>
               <p>The paroxiſms in this variety of the fever ſeldom ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed eighteen hours, and in ſome caſes are finiſhed in twelve, and the remiſſions are diſtinguiſhed by more or leſs perſpiration, though this ſeldom extends completely to every part of the body. The remiſſions in thoſe caſes, which are accompanied with copious evacuations of bile, though more perfect than thoſe, in which the phlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtic diatheſis is predominant, are by no means com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete; the head-ach and other diſagreeable feelings uſually abate, but ſigns of languor, and of imperfect ſolution, are ſtill obſervable, in the tongue, pulſe and ſkin.</p>
               <p>The paroxiſms frequently increaſe in violence, in the progreſs of the fever, and the remiſſions become leſs diſtinct. In children the firſt paroxiſm, is ſometimes introduced with an epileptic ſit, and in many of ſuch young ſubjects, it is common for the febrile action to be determined, particularly to the brain; and to terminate in hydrocephalos internus: This is more particularly the caſe in the early part of ſummer, when cold weather is ſucceeded by ſudden and intenſe heat.</p>
               <p>In ſome caſes, particularly in perſons addicted to free living, inſtead of a paroxiſm, conſiſting of different parts, in a certain order of ſucceſſion, there is ſometimes an entire ſtupor and inſenſibility, which continues for a
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:033590_0059_0FF7944B7B25BD28"/>
determinate ſpace of time, accompanied with evident ſigns of fever, eſpecially with fluſhing in the face, and full pulſe; while in others during the whole period of each paroxiſm, and eſpecially previous to the exacerba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a tremor and agitation of the limbs are conſtant.</p>
               <p>In debilitated conſtitutions, each ſucceeding paroxiſm generally returns ſooner than the regular period, always with ſymptoms of great diſtreſs, and ſometimes with new and alarming ones; it generally declines at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in twelve or fourteen hours, but each ſucceeding remiſſion becomes leſs diſtinct, except when obviated by the rules of art.</p>
               <p>The fevers which occurred at Philadelphia, in the autumn of 1794, (the ſpring and fore part of the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of which had been preceded by a great deal of rain,) were generally double tertains, the paroxiſm be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning one day in the forenoon, the next in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon. In the caſes that became dangerous, or difficult of cure, the paroxiſms were gradually anticipated half an hour, or an hour every day, till the fever became an obſcure remittent, reſembling the typhus, or fever of a continued type. In thoſe caſes in which the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxiſm came on later every day, the diſeaſe in a few days became a regular intermittent.</p>
               <p>In the central parts of the city, this fever was a rare occurrence; but in the ſuburbs and the ſouthern and weſtern parts of the city it was, to a limitted degree epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic. But from the notes which I kept of the ſtate of the weather and diſeaſes of that ſeaſon, it appears that on the 1ſt. of September, there were twenty caſes of ſimple intermitting fever, to one of remittent.</p>
               <p>Several caſes of remittent with bilious puking occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on the 16th. Three caſes of double quotidian came under my care, i. e. two paroxiſms came on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, one in the forenoon and one the evening, but the ſymptoms were always more violent every third day. The water in the ponds which had been conſtantly full of water, on each ſide of pine and lombard ſtreets began to diminiſh rapidly about the middle of the month. On the 19th. a ſudden change of the wind to N. W. reduced the thermometer 17°. Immediately after
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:033590_0060_0FF7944E9E95D580"/>
this change in the temperature of the air, almoſt every family in the vicinity of thoſe ponds were attacked with tertian, or quotidian fevers. On the 26th. I viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſixteen patients, with diſtinct intermiſſions.</p>
               <p>Ten caſes remittent, with inflammatory ſymptoms, and three with bilious evacuations. Intermittents and remittents, continued prevalent till after the middle of October; but as the ſeaſon grew colder, they either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined or became combined, with topical inflammations.</p>

               <p>THE ſpring and ſummer of the year 1795 were agreeable, cool, and frequently refreſhed with rain. Torrents of rain fell all the firſt week of Auguſt, the wind N. E. and occaſioned remarkable freſhes, which occaſioned great injury to the agricultural intereſt. Not a caſe of remittent came to my knowledge before the 16th of this month: From this time till after the middle of October, intermittents and remittents were only ſporadic.</p>
               <p>All the ponds, ditches and hollows about the city, continued full of water, from July till after the 10th. of September, a proof that much rain had fallen within that period: About the middle of the month heavy dews began to fall, and ſeveral caſes of remittents occurred, accompanied with bilious diſcharges. Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral caſes of cholera alſo occurred at the ſame time. On the 16th of September, the proportion of intermittents to that of remittents, was ten to four.</p>
               <p>By the 17th. the water in the ponds and ditches had diminiſhed conſiderably, and preſented a moiſt and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid ſurface to the ſun.</p>
               <p>Froſt was obſerved for the firſt time this ſeaſon, early in the morning of the 23d. The cold weather has begun to give an inflammatory complexion to the intermittents, which have lately occurred in ſouthwark and the extremities of the city. The weather became

mild on the 24th. and continued ſo till the 4th. of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, two days excepted, on one of which a conſiderable quantity of rain fell.</p>
               <p>On the 5th. of October it became ſo cold, as to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der fires neceſſary.</p>
               <p>The proportion of remittents, to that of intermittents, was three to one; but caſes of neither were very nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous.</p>
               <p>From the 6th. to 12th. the weather was calm and mild; after rain which fell on the 11th. the wind chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to N. W. and became cool and pleaſant; on the 13th. it again became calm and ſultry, 14th. cloudy; 15th. heavy rain: remittents were now more general than they had been any part of the ſeaſon, and were for the moſt part accompanied with ſtrong and quick action of the arteries. Blood-letting ſoon after the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the fever, to a ſecond, and ſometimes to a third time, from ten to fourteen ounces at a time, was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times found requiſite to procure a perfect intermiſſion.

               <p>Ice appeared on the gutters, in the morning of the 18th.</p>
               <p>On the 21ſt. I had ſeveral caſes of intermittent, but only one of remittent fever.</p>

               <p>The preceding returns demonſtrate that the bilious remitting fever very ſeldom becomes epidemic in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia, though ſporadic caſes occur annually at the ſame ſeaſon.</p>

               <head>OF THE TREATMENT.</head>
               <p>IN order to the ſucceſsful treatment of this fever, the firſt thing to be attended to is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of the remote cauſes, or thoſe circumſtances which gave it birth. Removal therefore to a dryer ſituation and purer air, is next to indiſpenſible.</p>
               <p>The next ſtep is to attempt by the moſt efficacious means to obtain an intermiſſion as ſpeedily as poſſible after the attack of the fever, that the Peruvian bark may be adminiſtered to the beſt advantage.</p>
               <p>With this view, we are to conſider how far the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the fever on its firſt attack, will admit of blood letting and the antiphlogiſtic regimen, always retaining in memory, that ſo long as the inflammatory ſymptoms are evident, which is always the caſe when the pulſe is ſtrong and full, or quick and hard, or tenſe, however <hi>ſmall</hi> and <hi>low</hi> it may feel, and the ſkin continues hot and dry, the tongue white and moiſt, the pain in the head, back, or limbs violent, blood letting is not only a ſafe, but a neceſſary remedy, a Sine qua non, which <hi>ought not</hi> to be diſpenſed with.</p>
               <p>The ſucceſs which attended blood-letting in ſome caſes of yellow fever, connected with local affection in the autumn of 1793, and an opinion which has ſince been conceived or adopted by ſome of the phyſicians of Philadelphia, that all fevers depend on the ſame proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate cauſe, differing only in degree, however produced; and that they are all inflammatory at the beginning,
<pb facs="unknown:033590_0065_0FF7945BC9C121A0"/>
has induced ſeveral phyſicians to transfer the fame prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to the kind of fever, under conſideration. In caſes alſo purely in ammatory, blood has been drawn to an aſtoniſhing quantity, without any apparent injury, but in every caſe as far as I have been able to obtain infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, it has proved injurious and in ſome caſes fatal when the diſeaſe was not attended with inflammatory ſymptoms, or when th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe were partial and ſlight.</p>
               <p>In a great number of patients however with a fever of a remitting form, connected with an in inflammatory diatheſis (which frequently occurs in the fore part of ſummer, and the latter end of autumn) I have frequently found it requiſite to take away ten or twelve ounces of blood every day to a fifth time, and in a few caſes where the pulſe was very quick and hard, I have opened a vein with advantage twice a-day, and I believe it ought to be a rule in all ſuch caſes, to bleed more or leſs accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the violence of the ſymptoms, without regard to the period of the diſeaſe, or the name which others may think proper to call it. I muſt at the ſame time obſerve, that where purging and antimonials are freely employed, they will in many caſes even when inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory ſymptoms are predominant, ſupercede the neceſſity of being ſo very laviſh of human blood.</p>
               <p>I have learned by frequent experience the truth of Dr. Balfour's obſervations, that all laxative and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative medicines as well as injections, are very uncertain in their operation, and frequently diſappointment us, ſo long as any conſiderable degree of fever is preſent. The period therefore at which fevers ſhew a tendency to remit, ſhould be carefully watched, and purgatives adminiſtered on the firſt ſigns of a remiſſion—And when theſe are not evident, ſtill the uſual period of remiſſion is to be preferred for that purpoſe. At this time they will generally operate and evacuate the bile, ſecreted and accumulated during the exacerbation, which is the firſt and indeed, an indiſpenſible requiſite in the cure of theſe fevers.</p>
               <p>Mercury is ſo effectual for this purpoſe and at the ſame time attended with ſo little hazard, that it may be with propriety ſtiled the key of the hepatic ſyſtem.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="unknown:033590_0066_0FF7945D5A32B5F8"/>Mercury has been for ſeveral years employed as a purge of ſuperior efficacy in bilious fevers, by ſeveral reſpectable phyſicians in Europe as well as in the Eaſt and Weſt Indies, particularly by Dr. Gilchriſt, Pringle, and Hamilton. And it was employed by the late Dr. Huck Saunders in the cure of intermittents, in which the bark failed; but, the diſcovery of its efficacy in the cure of malignant and contagious fevers when employed ſo as ſpeedily to affect the ſalivary glands, was reſerved for Dr. C. Chiſholm, who firſt employed it for that purpoſe in the year 1791.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Duncan's Med. Comment. for 1793.</note> How far it will have the ſame effect in caſes of the fever under conſideration, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains ſtill to be determined by future obſervations;— but from its effects in caſes of obſtinate intermittents, when given in ſmall and repeated doſes internally, or employed by friction externally, till it occaſions ſaliva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there is every reaſon to expect it will have the ſame effect in caſes of bilious remitting fever.</p>
               <p>Dr. Clark, in his Obſervations on Diſeaſes of Long Voyages, gives the following account of the efficacy of mercury in violent caſes of fever. Vol. I. page 182. edit. 2d. "I have had much experience of the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior efficacy of calomel, conjoined with opium, in tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off irritability of ſtomach, and in opening the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els: And therefore in all dangerous remitting fevers, attended with vomiting, burning heat, and pain at ſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach, I would recommend the pills, No. 4.<note n="†" place="bottom">Four of theſe, contain ten grs. of Calomel, and two of opium.</note> Two to be taken immediately, and one to be repeated every half hour, till the pain abates. After this their operation is to be aſſiſted by gliſters, fomentations, and in very urgent caſes, by the uſe of the warm bath.</p>
               <p>"When the irritability of the ſtomach, is by theſe means removed, all bilious and corrupted humours ſhould be carried off by a ſolution of ſalts, in a decoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of tamarinds, or an infuſion of ſinna, &amp;c." In a note at page 183, Dr. Clark adds, "The yellow fever
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:033590_0067_0FF794601502E418"/>
of the Weſt Indies, and that of Senegal, have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to be always beyond the power of medicine; but I have little doubt, that the fatality of the worſt kind of fever, may be obviated by a practice ſimilar to that above mentioned." In ſuch caſes, he alſo recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends "A hundred drops of laudanum in an emol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lient gliſter; the patient to be put into a warm bath, and when removed to bed, eight or ten grs. of calo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel to be given in the form of pills, with opium, if the anodine gliſter has not removed the vomiting, the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the pills to be promoted by purgative gliſters, and as ſoon as the bowels are opened, to throw in the bark, in the moſt liberal manner, without loſs of time."</p>
               <p>Dr. Balfour, who practiſed medicine twenty years in different parts of the Eaſt Indies, gives the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing teſtimony in favour of the uſe of mercury in fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. (Treatiſe on Putrid Peſtilential Remitting Fevers, publiſhed in 1790, page 109.) "Calomel in a decree, ſuperior to any other medicine, I am acquainted with, poſſeſſes the property of looſening and detaching the mucus of the inteſtines: It requires, in general from ſix to ten hours to effect this perfectly, and operates beſt when the patient lies quietly in bed. A proper doſe to an adult, is from ſix to twelve grs. and this doſe muſt be repeated from three to ſix times, or as often as the ſtate and contents of the inteſtines may require, at the beginning of the diſeaſe, and afterwards occaſionally, as it may ſeem to be required, by the fulneſs of the bowels and the ſtate of the contents." When the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus is looſened by the calomel, Dr. Balfour, preſcribes a ſolution of ſalts, with a very ſmall portion of emetic tartar, to be given in divided doſes, every morning after the calomel, at the beginning of the diſeaſe. After this proceſs, he preſcribes the liberal uſe of the bark, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Dr. Wade, alſo a phyſician of conſiderable experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, who practiſed in the Eaſt Indies, after delivering an opinion, that the fevers of that climate, depend upon a vitiated ſtate of the mucus of the inteſtinal canal, and recommending active purgatives for the removal of their cauſe, adds, "As the diſeaſe does not always ariſe from the quantity or quality of groſſer matters in the
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:033590_0068_0FF79462ECA0D1E8"/>
ſtomach and inteſtines, or from any portion of vitiated bile and other ſecretions, which the utmoſt power of the uſual purgatives can effect, we muſt have recourſe to ſuch as are active, and better calculated to remove the complaint. It may be deemed particularly fortunate, that the purgatives which prove moſt ſucceſsful in fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, are as mild in their operation, as they are certain and powerful.</p>
               <p>"From two to ten, or more grs. of calomel, with a greater proportion of any of the other articles, form a doſe of the utmoſt ſafety. Theſe doſes ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated every ſecond night, or if the ſymptoms are preſſing, every night, as long as any thing offenſive ſhall remain to be diſcharged from the bowels."<note n="*" place="bottom">Sir John Pringle preſcribed twelve grs. of calomel, and thirty of rhubarb, for a doſe to ſoldier. W. C.</note>
               </p>
               <p>"It may be received as a general rule, that the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial laxative be given at night, and the medicines neceſſary to promote its effects, early next morning, as well as in the courſe of the day. The more thoſe ſymptoms called putrid, or nervous are preſent, is the uſe of mercurial purgatives indicated.</p>

               <p>Dr. Blane, in his Obſervations on the Bilious Remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Fever of Hot Climates, remarks, that "when the fever appears to be kept up by a freſh accumulation of bile, the repetition of evacuants is neceſſary, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomel will be found to anſwer remarkably well as a purgative, its ſtimulus being ſo extenſive as to looſen, and bring away bile, when the ſaline purgatives had failed of having that effect; and it will be ſtill more effectual for this purpoſe, if given alone, in a doſe, from five to ten grains, and followed ſome hours after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by ſome other purgative." (Obſervations on Diſeaſes of Seamen, page 392, &amp;c.)</p>
               <p>In obſtinate and protracted intermittents, that reſiſted the power of the bark, it was the practice of the late Dr. Thomas Bond, at the Pennſylvania Hoſpital, to put
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:033590_0069_0FF794656B11BDD8"/>
the patient under a ſlight courſe of mercury, after which the bark generally ſucceeded. And we are informed by Dr. Blane that Dr. Huck Saunders aſſured him, that he had frequently cured agues, in which the bark had failed, by putting the patient on a courſe of mercury, and afterwards returning to the uſe of the bark. (Page 428 of Dr. G. Blane's Obſervations, publiſhed in 1785.)</p>
               <p>Dr. Chiſholm firſt diſcovered the efficacy of mercury in 1791 in a contagious fever which he at firſt miſtook for the hepatitis, in the cure of which its efficacy had been for a conſiderable time eſtabliſhed, not only in the Eaſt Indies, but in England, as appears from the 9th. Volume of the Edinburgh Medical Commentaries. In the yellow fever at Grenada in 1793, he alſo experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced its ſuperior efficacy. Dr. Gilchriſt, (as appears from the Edinburgh Eſſays and Obſervations, Phyſical and Literary, Vol. III. page 498) more than fifty years ago, entertained the moſt decided opinion of the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of mercury in the low ſtate of fever, connected with inflammation. Dr. Gilchriſt's diſcovery has ſince been followed and improved upon by ſeveral phyſicians of acknowledged merit. But he whoſe penetration makes the firſt diſcovery or improvement, and removes inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious prejudices, is entitled to the greateſt ſhare of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and applauſe.</p>
               <p>Dr. Gilchriſt's practice was afterwards applied to the liver diſeaſe in the Eaſt Indies, and from an apparent analogy, being applicable to bilious fevers, it has ſince been a remedy in the hands of almoſt every practitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Conſequently as a medicine in thoſe kinds of diſeaſes, it is not entitled to the diſtinguiſhed name of a <hi>New Remedy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As the chief objects of attention in the majority of caſes in this fever (when debility and bilious evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are the moſt prominent ſymptoms) are the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the ſtomach and inteſtines; upon the patient's firſt complaint, before the paroxiſm of the fever has formed, or while the patient perhaps only complains of alternate heats and chills, the contents of the ſtomach
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:033590_0070_0FF7946ACD6DC268"/>
ſhould be immediately evacuated, either by an emetic, cathartic, or by a purging gliſter. But if the pain of his head be violent, blood-letting ſhould always be premiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, unleſs great proſtration of ſtrength ſhould forbid it.</p>
               <p>The next ſtep towards procuring a remiſſion, is to open the pores of the ſkin. This in the beginning of the diſeaſe, where my obſervations have principally been made, is beſt accompliſhed by the following draught, repeated every ſecond or third hour, with plentiful warm dilution of the antiphlogiſtic kind.</p>

               <p>Experience teaches us that antimonials are particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly uſeful in the early period of this fever, eſpecially when there is the leaſt tendency to an inflammatory dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis, which is always the caſe when the pulſe at the wriſt is tenſe, and the throbbing in the temporal and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotid arteries ſtrong.</p>
               <p>In caſes however where there are are no evidence of ſuch diatheſis, but where the proſtration of ſtrength is very conſiderable, they are not only uſeleſs, but inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, as they have a tendency to counteract the ſmall degree of power ſtill remaining, and which can only be augmented by cordial and nutritive remedies.</p>
               <p>When the means already preſcribed, fail of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing an evident remiſſion, the fever is generally kept up by a freſh accumulation of bile in the gall blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or ducts of the liver. When this is the caſe, there is generally a ſenſe of weight or uneaſineſs about the hypochondria. In theſe circumſtances a repetition of evacuants is requiſite, and calomel as recommended by the ſagacious Dr. Blane (a living author in high eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation) is generally ſound to anſwer remarkably well as a purgative, its ſtimulus being ſo extenſive, as to looſen and bring away bile as well as hardened faeces, when the ſaline purgatives have failed of that effect. "The calomel has been found moſt effectual for this purpoſe when given during the remiſſion, in a doſe of
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:033590_0071_0FF7946C635B6C10"/>
from five to ten grains, followed five or ſix hours after by a gliſter, or ſome mild purgative."</p>
               <p>This being effected, antimonial are to be again ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered in ſmall doſes, and if there be no inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory ſymptoms preſent, an anodine, combined with an antimonial, and a little of the ſaline mixture ſhould be given every night at bed time.</p>

               <p>The principal point of management, after an evident remiſſion is obtained, is to adminiſter the Peruvian bark to the beſt advantage.</p>
               <p>Whatever may be the caſe in tropical climates, more or leſs remiſſion is always neceſſary in this part of the world, eſpecially at an early period of the diſeaſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this medicine can be adminiſtered with ſucceſs, or even ſafety.</p>
               <p>When the remiſſion is prevented by exceſs of debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in the arterial ſyſtem, which may generally be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered from the weakneſs of the pulſe, and great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity to faint, or become ſick at ſtomach upon being raiſed up; bliſters as well as a more cordial regimen are abſolutely neceſſary, and in general produce a favourable effect.</p>
               <p>The bark ſhould be adminiſtered during every remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in as large doſes as the ſtomach can retain, without occaſioning much oppreſſion or ſickneſs.</p>
               <p>It is beſt in ſubſtance, but when it cannot be taken in that manner, it may be made into a ſtrong decoction, in conjunction with a little Columbo root and ſerpenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria: Should the ſtomach reject it in this form, we ought without delay, to have recourſe to it in gliſters, with the addition of a little laudanum. In this way, from two to four drachms of bark, with ten or fifteen drops of laudanum ſhould be adminiſtered every two hours, mixed with a tea cup full of panada or ſowl broth, till the return of the fever, during the exacerbation of which an antimonial mixture is again to be made uſe of.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="unknown:033590_0072_0FF7946E1E6301C8"/>When conſiderably weakened by the paroxiſm, a little wine, eſpecially old port, on account of its aſtringency and tonic effect, ſhould be occaſionally joined with the bark, or a little of it given after every doſe.</p>
               <p>Wine however is ſeldom proper, or even ſafe in large draughts, in the early ſtage of this fever, except in thoſe caſes when the proſtration of ſtrength is very evident and alarming.</p>
               <p>In every caſe, where the remiſſion is obſcure or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, and no local affection, or inflammatory ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms are diſcoverable, the moſt probable means of affording relief, is to excite a univerſal ſweat. This is not only an imitation of nature, but is founded on reaſon and experience, for it is by ſweating, that the ſit of an intermittent is terminated; this however ſhould be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted by gentle ſoothing means, and not by ſtrong ſtimulating, and heating medicines and regimen.</p>
               <p>For this purpoſe, the following compoſition, given at the height of the paroxiſm, is frequently effectual.</p>

               <p>To coincide with the ſame intention, and to render the effect of the above compoſition more certain, plentiful and warm dilution is neceſſary: And I have generally found an infuſion of ſerpentaria, ſage, or ſome other mild aromatic, preferable to farinacious decoctions, or vinous mixtures. The application of warm moiſture to the ſurface of the body, renders the effect of the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies already mentioned ſtill more certain. This may be performed by bathing the feet and hands in warm water, or by fomenting the thighs, legs, and arms, with warm ſtupes; theſe operations have the effect of bringing on a general relaxation on the ſkin, of diminiſhing irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and delirium, and of inducing ſleep.</p>
               <p>But before we make uſe of pediluvia and warm fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations in this fever, we ſhould be well aſſured that the ſtrength of the pulſe and velocity of the circulation are not already too great, otherwiſe inſtead of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the end for which we uſe them, we ſhall find if the heat of the water exceeds 98°, they will have a contrary effect, becauſe of the ſtricture induced on the exhalents by the heat, which not only ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates the ſolids, but diſtends the fluids. The pulſe muſt however be raiſed ſeveral degrees above the healthy ſtate of action, otherwiſe no ſweat will flow.</p>
               <p>Some patients are troubled with inceſſant puking previous to the acceſſion of every freſh paroxiſm, and are ſometimes ſo debilitated and reduced by it, as to threaten immediate danger. In theſe caſes after having immerſed the feet and legs in water as warm as can be conveniently borne, from 30 to 40 drops of liquid lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danum ſhould be taken in a draught of peppermint julep, or combined with an efferveſcent mixture of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable alkali and lime juice, and ſhould be repeated after every evacuation, till it have the deſired effect. If the ſtomach reject the laudanum immediately after it has been taken, a double quantity mixed with a little aromatic infuſion or tea, ſhould be thrown into the bowels frequently. If this ſhould fail, or ſhould not be ſubmitted to, flannels wrung out of hot ſpirits of wine or brandy, and covered with powdered ſpices, ſuch as cinnamon, alſpice, and cloves, or ginger, and black pepper, ſhould be applied to the ſtomach, feet, and wriſts; or they may be rubbed with oil of cloves, lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danum, and ſweet oil, and covered with heated flannels. When chilly ſenſations prevail, theſe applications are nearly equal to bliſters. Bliſters to the thighs however may be applied at the ſame time when the caſe is urgent; and in alarming caſes, a bliſtering plaiſter ſhould always be applied to the ſtomach.</p>
               <p>As puking frequently precedes or accompanies every freſh paroxiſm, and is attended with a ſenſible diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of vigour in the ſeveral functions of the body, and takes place nearly at the ſame hour every day, or every ſecond day; it may generally be prevented by giving the patient from twenty-five to forty drops of Thebaic tincture, in any mild and palatable cordial draught, two hours before the expected paroxiſm, and eſpecially if bliſters be applied to the wriſts or legs at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="unknown:033590_0074_0FF7943463A7BF20"/>When the caſe is not ſo urgent as to threaten imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate death, the feet and hands may be plunged into cold water to increaſe their irritability, before the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of heat and other ſtimuli.</p>
               <p>In many caſes inceſſant vomiting cannot be reſtrained by any means till the circulation is reſtored to the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, and perſpiration takes place. For this reaſon we are adviſed by Dr. Jackſon to take the patient out of bed, daſh cold water over his head and ſhoulders, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn him to bed, and to give him a cordial anodine draught, with warm aromatic and palatable drinks. Theſe means he informs us (and my own experience confirms the truth of his information) generally occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion a calm and equable perſpiration, with great abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of irritability, and frequently a complete inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the fever; and by keeping up a determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion afterwards to the ſurface by means of diaphoretics, diluting drinks, and a bliſter to the liver, bilious eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations ſeldom become troubleſome during the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing courſe of the fever.</p>
               <p>I have alſo frequently ſeen the ſtomach ſettled by ſmall and repeated draughts of hot lime juice punch, while the patient's feet and legs were fomented with flannels wrung out of warm water.</p>
               <p>Where lime juice cannot be readily obtained, for making the efferveſcent neutral mixture, the following powder may be ſubſtituted.</p>

               <p>By throwing this powder into a glaſs of water, an efferveſcent neutral mixture, is inſtantly formed.</p>
               <p>In the generality of caſes in this fever, it is of much importance to prevent the patient from becoming coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and frequently to carry off the bilious matter which is conſtantly ſecreted; otherwiſe the Peruvian bark, the remedy on which we chiefly depend for the cure, cannot be given to effect. On the contrary, if given when bilious and other acrid and excrementitious matters abound, it generally occaſions ſpaſmodic affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or diſtentions of the ſtomach and inteſtines; adds
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:033590_0075_0FF794744DEDB450"/>
to the feveriſh heat, and often occaſions a foulneſs of the tongue and fauces, and ſometimes brings on de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lirium.</p>
               <p>Moderate and frequent evacuations by ſtool, under theſe circumſtances, inſtead of weakening the patient, ſenſibly refreſh and ſtrengthen him, in proportion as the aggravating cauſe of irritation and diſtreſs is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from the bowels.</p>
               <p>But as bilious, and other excrementitious matters originate and accumulate from debility and relaxation, as ſoon as they are removed by the recited means, their recurrence ſhould be as much as poſſible prevented by the free uſe of the bark, and ſuch drinks and aliment, as are found upon trial, to agree beſt with the patient. The application of a bliſter to the region of the liver, is a moſt invaluable remedy for this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Where however, there is great lowneſs, and diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſwoon upon riſing; gliſters ſhould be employed inſtead of purgatives, when occaſion requires. In theſe circumſtances, copious evacuations are generally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious.</p>
               <p>In all caſes attended with ſymptoms of evident debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and ineffectual re-action in the vaſcular ſyſtem; bliſters ought always to be employed without delay, the earlier after the attack, the better. The excitement produced in the centre of the nervous ſyſtem, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſinſory, by their ſtimulating power, is conveyed to every part of the ſyſtem, and new vigour is given to every function. That the power and action of the heart, as well as the voluntary muſcles, depend in a great meaſure on the excitement, and power of the ſenſorium, is clearly demonſtrated, by its ceſſation immediately after the cardiac nerves have been divided.</p>
               <p>Though the firſt effects of bliſtering is to ſtimulate, excite, and invigorate, the diſcharge which follows, is debilitating in proportion to the quantity diſcharged, after the inflammation produced by the bliſter has ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided. For this reaſon, when our view in the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of bliſters, is to excite and invigorate the circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating powers, and not to relax and debilitate, the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face excoriated by the bliſter, ſhould be healed as
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:033590_0076_0FF794772FF4C390"/>
ſpeedily as poſſible, or freſh inflammation excited by ſome irritating ointment.</p>
               <p>I believe, from ſome trials I have ſeen, that it would be adviſable, as one part heals, to apply a bliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to another, for the purpoſe of keeping up ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive excitement, till an intermiſſion takes place.</p>
               <p>When from increaſing debility, neglect, miſmanage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp;c. the diſeaſe aſſumes a continued form, (which is very common in low damp ſituations, when the weather is very hot, ſultry, and calm,) the moſt ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous and perſevering efforts ſhould be made to invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorate the whole ſyſtem. For this purpoſe, in addition to the ſucceſſive application of bliſters, (one of which in dangerous caſes ſhould always be applied to the back part of the head and neck, or, if much affected with nervous delirium, over the centre of the head;) the beſt of wine ſhould be given in different forms, in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada, in whey, and by itſelf, obſerving always to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the quantity, by the ſtate of debility preſent, and its effects upon the pulſe, and brain.</p>
               <p>Strong decoctions of bark and ſerpentaria, ſhould alſo accompany the uſe of wine, and may be given now without regard to remiſſions. If the ſtomach rejects or loaths it in every form, it ſhould be employed in gliſters.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>In theſe circumſtances, we are aſſured by Dr. Jackſon, that he found more ſervice from the cold ſalt water bath in the remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting fever of Jamaica, than from any other remedy.</p>
                     <p>When the bath is employed, the patient, if his ſtrength will admit, is ſeated in an arm chair in a large tub, and one or two large buckets of water are poured over his body, after which he is wiped dry and conveyed to bed: This operation is generally directed twice or thrice a day, or oftner in alarming caſes. When the bath cannot be employed this way, the patient's body may be waſhed two or three times a-day with the ſalt water, as cold as he can bear it, by means of napkins wet with it, and afterwards wiped dry.</p>
                     <p>"Where a putrid tendency is evident in the ſyſtem, which is always indicated by petechiae and great proſtration of ſtrength, beſides the cold ſalt bath, cool air, clean linen, cold drink, and the liberal uſe of wine, cannot be too much inſiſted on."</p>

               <p>Doctor Cullen, who paradoxically ſays, it poſſeſſes both a ſtimulant and ſedative power, adviſes it in large doſes, and to be repeated only once in ſix or eight hours, while others, leſs influenced by theory, perhaps, direct it in ſmall and repeated doſes, in conjunction with vinous drinks. In this way it is a remedy of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior efficacy, in all caſes accompanied with low, weak pulſe, and failure of the vital powers; and eſpecially in all caſes attended with typhomania and ſubſultus ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinum.</p>
               <p>When any difficulty occurs in diſtinguiſhing the weak pulſe from the ſtrong one, we are aſſured by Dr. Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win (in his Zoonomia, Vol. 2d. page 301,) that "it may generally be aſcertained by counting its frequency. For when an adult patient lies horizontally in a cool room, and is not hurried or alarmed by any circumſtance, nor ſtimulated by wine or opium, the <hi>ſtrong pulſe</hi> ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom exceeds 118 or 120 in a minute; and the <hi>weak pulſe</hi> is generally not much leſs than 130, and often much above that number. Secondly, in ſitting up in bed, or changing the horizontal, to an erect poſture, the weak pulſe is immediately quickened 10 or 12 pulſations in a minute, which is not the caſe in the ſtrong pulſe, when the patient has reſted after the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of riſing."</p>
               <p>It has long been known to phyſiologiſts, that ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and voluntary motion, depend upon a certain power or function of the brain; but it is a diſcovery of modern date, that, though the muſcular fibres of the heart, are endowed with a certain degree of inherent power, they are ſtill for ſuch action as is neceſſary to the motion of the blood, very conſtantly dependent on a nervous pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er tranſmitted into them from the brain, which influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and modifies the actions of the heart: This is
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:033590_0078_0FF7947ACF881300"/>
evident from the motions of the laſt mentioned organ immediately ceaſing, upon dividing the cardiac nerves. A force is therefore ſuppoſed to be conſtantly exerted in the brain during life, which is extended to the fibres of the heart, as well as to every other part of the body.</p>
               <p>It is evident to the moſt ſuperficial obſerver, that the ſenſibility, and irritability of every part of the body, are rendered leſs ſuſceptible of impreſſions, by the uſe of opium.</p>
               <p>In all caſes of pain ariſing from any cauſe, except that from inflammation, it is a ſure and never fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing palliative, and generally ſucceeds in procuring ſleep, if given in doſes ſufficiently large to overcome the irritations preſent in the ſyſtem, or to allay the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite irritability.</p>
               <p>The beſt method of aſcertaining the manner in which any medicine operates, is in the firſt place, to obſerve the ultimate effect, and then to go back ſtep by ſtep as far as poſſible to the primary cauſe: The firſt cauſe has in no inſtance been diſcovered demonſtratively; but in tracing ſecondary cauſes, we may proceed with to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable certainty: Agreeably to this plan, I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to aſcertain the effects of opium upon the living body; and have found its firſt effect, is uniformly that of increaſing the temperature of the body. As from the ſenſible qualities of this ſubſtance it cannot act like heat, by uniting with, and increaſing the temperature of other bodies, it muſt act by increaſing the cauſe of heat, but as the heat of the body is always in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ſtrength, or the rapidity with which the blood circulates through the veſſels, nothing can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the temperature of the body, which does not at the ſame time augment the rapidity of the circulating blood. The increaſe of heat takes place ſoon after tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing opium, which muſt therefore be owing to the ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus of the opium upon the heart and veſſels, by ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy from the nerves of the ſtomach, or through the intervention of the brain.</p>
               <p>When there is great determination to the head, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with ferocious delirium and great reſtleſſneſs,
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:033590_0079_0FF79480246663D0"/>
neither wine nor opium ſhould be employed. The moſt ſerious conſequences have ariſen, from the intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate uſe of cordials in ſuch circumſtances. Here bleeding, and bliſtering the head, and ſedatives, are indicated; but when the pulſe is low and quick, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with convulſive motions of the muſcles of the limbs, two or three grains of opium, joined with eight or ten of Sal. Am. Vol. made into a bolus, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve of roſes, ought to be given at bed time; and five or ſix grains of the volatile ſalts, with five or ſix drops of laudanum every two or three hours in the day time, followed by a large draught of a ſtrong decoction of bark and ſnake root, ſangree, or wine whey.</p>
               <p>In the laſt recited circumſtances, genuine Madeira wine is the moſt agreeable, as well as the moſt effectual cordial that can be employed; and may be given with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſtriction day and night, till the ſubſultus and tremors give way, and the pulſe feels fuller and more vigorous. Some of the caſes which are the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manageable and fatal, are thoſe in which there is a ſpontaneous diarrhoea.</p>
               <p>In every inſtance therefore, when the diarrhoea is ſo profuſe as to debilitate, an attempt ſhould be made to reſtrain it.</p>
               <p>This in general is moſt effectually done, by taking a ſmall doſe of tincture of opium, with two or three table ſpoonfuls of the chalk mixture, of the London Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatory, five or ſix times a-day, and the confictio opiata, at night.</p>
               <p>It often happens, that the patient cannot be prevailed upon to take the above medicines: In ſuch caſes a few drops of tinct. opii. in a little wine mulled with the yelk of an egg, cinnamon and ſugar will have the ſame effect, and is much more grateful to the patient.</p>
               <p>The hiccup is moſt effectually relieved by opium and aether, and the application of a bliſter to the ſtomach.</p>
               <p>The moſt ſuitable and agreeable aliment is ſago, panada, chicken broth, or beef tea; with the addition of more or leſs wine, according as the debility is greater or leſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="unknown:033590_0080_0FF79481B6252138"/>When wine raiſes the pulſe, and invigorates the ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, without inducing delirium, it is right to perſiſt in giving it; but when it occaſions or increaſes delirium, reſtleſſneſs and heat, it ought inſtantly to be diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued. The intention of giving wine, is to increaſe and ſupport the powers of the ſyſtem; not to heat, ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate, and prevent ſleep.</p>
               <p>In general, if the bark be given freely in the time of the remiſſions, there will ſeldom be a neceſſity to give much wine, during the firſt week of the fever, and ſeldom afterwards, to exceed one pint of Madeira or port, or a bottle of claret, in twenty-four hours.</p>
               <p>In caſes, where coma, or lethargic ſymptoms come on, beſides the cordials already mentioned, a bliſter ſhould be applied to the coronal future, and ſinapiſm to the feet.</p>
               <p>When the fever is entirely ſubdued, and the patient in a ſtate of convaleſcency, he ſhould ſtill continue the uſe of wine, or porter, and a nouriſhing invigorating diet. He ſhould alſo frequently take moderate exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe in the open air in ſuitable weather, obſerving to accommodate his dreſs, to the changes of the weather, and to his debilitated condition.</p>
               <p>To promote a more ſpeedy recovery, it will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to make uſe of an infuſion of cort. Peru. or rad. Columb. in water with the addition of a little of Hux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's tinct. cort. or old brandy, with the daily uſe of the cold ſhower, or plunging bath, and a doſe or two of ſome agreeable compoſition, with ſal. mart. or flor. martial. If the ſtomach remains weak and dyſpeptic, brandy and water, will be a preferable drink, to either wine or porter. Oedematous ſwellings are apt to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this fever, when it has been long protracted.</p>
               <p>Theſe, where no tumefaction and obſtruction of the liver or ſpleen are diſcoverable, generally give way to exerciſe, and regular, generous, but not intemperate living. When they do not, diuretics ought always to be combined with tonics.</p>
               <p>Ten or fifteen grains of pearl aſh, taken two or three times a-day, in a draught of the following bitter infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, generally anſwers this purpoſe equal to any other.</p>

               <head>AN ACCOUNT OF THE FEBRILE DISORDERS WHICH PREVAILED IN SHEFFIELD IN THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS, IN THE YEARS 1793, 1794 AND 1795. <hi>EXTRACTED</hi> FROM A LETTER OF WILLIAM BUEL, PHYSICIAN AT SHEFFIELD, TO E. H. SMITH, PHYSICIAN AT NEW YORK.</head>
               <p>BEFORE entering directly on the ſubject of the diſorders, which prevailed here in 1793, 1794 and 1795, I ſhall mention ſome circumſtances relative to the face of the country in the Town of Sheffield.</p>
               <p>The river Houſatonak runs in a ſerpentine courſe through this town, from North to South. Upon the banks of the river, on each ſide, is an extent of intervale, or meadow land, averaging on both ſides at about a mile in breadth. The greateſt part of this intervale is overflowed at the time of the thawing away of the ſnow, in the ſpring; and ſometimes, by large and ſudden freſhets, at other ſeaſons. The nature of the ſoil, in general, is ſuch, that, very ſoon after the water is off, the land is dry and fit for tillage. It is, however, much interſperſed with coves and marſhes; in the former of which the water remains ſtagnant a conſiderable part of the ſummer, and in many of them perpetually; of the latter there are not many upon this river, but there are ſome which remain ſuch, through the ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>Beſide the Houſatonak, there are two other conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable ſtreams, running through part of this town,
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:033590_0083_0FF7948A951041F8"/>
which unite and empty into that river. Upon each of theſe ſtreams are large tracts of low, marſhy lands; great part of which is overflowed by freſhets, and is never perfectly dry.—There is (which is very mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial) a mill-dam, on each of theſe ſtreams; and the two dams occaſion the overflowing of ſeveral hundred acres of the low lands. As ſummer advances, and the ponds fall, conſiderable parts of theſe lands are left uncovered by the water; more or leſs, according to the drought of the ſummer. In both of theſe ponds are large quantities of timber and other vegetable matters, which in hot weather, are always in a ſtate of putrefaction. This ſtate exiſts in an increaſed degree as the ſubſtances become more expoſed to the action of the ſun. The foetor occaſioned by this putrefying maſs is ſuch, in hot weather and when the water is low, as to be extremely offenſive to the ſmell, at the diſtance of many rods.</p>
               <p>The inhabitants of this town, who live in the vicinity of theſe marſhy and drowned lands, have, as would naturally be expected, been always ſubject to remittent and intermittent fevers, from its firſt ſettlement. It is, however, generally remarked by the old people, that theſe diſorders have of late years, until the three laſt decreaſed, owing, probably, to the clearing, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial draining, of the lands.</p>
               <p>Although, the diſorders which have prevailed in this town, for two or three years paſt, are owing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, principally to theſe local cauſes; yet it is not improbable, that ſome prediſpoſition to them was occaſioned by a general conſtitution of the air. To aſcertain this point, with any degree of preciſion, we ought to have before us an accurate hiſtory of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for ſeveral years paſt. Even then it would, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, be impoſſible; as it ever has been found a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult matter to trace any connection between the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt qualities of the air, and the effects of a general conſtitution of it, favourable to diſeaſe. As I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, either from minutes, or memory, to give any account of the weather, I ſhall leave the matter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attempted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="unknown:033590_0084_0FF7948C294BB760"/>In the year 1793, during the ſeaſon in which ſuch complaints uſually appear, intermittents and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitants were more frequent than they had been for many years before. In September and October, there were a few ſcattering inſtances of bilious fevers.</p>
               <p>Early in the ſpring of 1794, inflammatory com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains, chiefly of the pneumonic kind, were unuſually prevalent. They were ſoon ſucceeded by intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents; which were more frequent than they had been the year before. Nothing peculiar attended them; and they continued to occur pretty often through the ſummer.</p>
               <p>Towards the laſt of July, the bilious, or, as it is called here, the pond-fever, began to make its appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; principally about the South Pond, one of the mill-ponds beforementioned, and near the Canaan line. There were ſome ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>attered inſtances about the North Pond: and a few, which were at ſuch a diſtance from both, that they were, probably, occaſioned by the ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant water about the great river, the Houſaconak. But the diſorder was chiefly confined to the vicinity of the South Pond. The influence of this pond appeared to extend about one mile and a half from its borders. Within this place there are about 150 inhabitants; and about 80 of this number were affected with the fever: part of them inhabitants of Sheffield, and a part of Canaan. Among thoſe who were ſick, there were five or ſix inſtances of mortality. There were not more than ten or twelve perſons who had the diſorder in other parts of the town. From theſe there was but one death; and that in a caſe complicated with pregnancy, and eventually with phthifis pulmonalis. People continued to be attacked with this fever through the months of Auguſt, September, and a part of October.</p>
               <p>The diſorder was, probably, in all reſpects, what is termed a bilious remitting fever. It began with an ague fit; intenſe pains in the back, head, and limbs, ſoon ſucceeded by thirſt, dryneſs of the ſkin, &amp;c. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing without much variation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>8 or 20 hours: a ſlight moiſture then broke out upon the ſkin—<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="82" facs="unknown:033590_0085_0FF7948DC5D06358"/>
a profuſe ſweat; a degree of remiſſion of the fever, and abatement of the pains, then enſued, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till about the time of day of the firſt attack, when another exacerbation of fever commenced, with ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms ſimilar to the firſt. If the diſeaſe was left to itſelf, the remiſſions would ſometimes become ſhorter and more imperfect, as the paroxiſms were repeated, until it grew to be nearly or quite a continued fever. A diarrhoea, and ſometimes dyſenteric ſymptoms were added to the reſt. Moſt of thoſe who died were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with a preternaturally lax ſtate of the bowels; which in ſeveral inſtances, might properly be called dyſenteric. The tongue was, from the firſt, covered with a white ſur. After three or four days, a black ſtripe began to appear; extending from the root, towards the extremity; and gradually ſpreading as the the diſorder advanced, till the whole tongue aſſumed a black appearance. Even the teeth and gums were ſometimes covered with this black fur; and in ſome patients who afterwards recovered.</p>
               <p>In the treatment of this diſorder, evacuation of ſome kind, is undoubtedly neceſſary in the early ſtage of it. Veneſection generally produced a temporary relief from the violence of the pain, and was, probably, when the conſtitution was firm and robuſt, and the habit ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoric, frequently uſeful; but it did not appear to me to be important as a curative remedy. Emetics ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times did well; and where there was a great degree of nauſea, I thought them uſeful. But purging, with ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomel and jalap, was the mode of evacuation I prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and generally practiſed; and the remedy which of all others appeared to be moſt advantageous in the early ſtage of the diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>It is unneceſſary for me to ſay any thing more, in this place, than the aſſiduous purging, in the beginning, and a plentiful uſe of the bark, after the remiſſions had become ſuch as to make it admiſſible, were the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial parts of the management of this diſorder.</p>
               <p>So ſtrong was the tendency to diſorders of this kind, that people continued in ſome inſtances to be affected with intermittents, or fever and ague, through the
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:033590_0086_0FF7948F95125D08"/>
winter. Theſe were frequent in the ſpring, but with no peculiarities, and yielding to the common remedy with the uſual facility.</p>
               <p>During the month of Auguſt 1795, I was in the county of Ontario, in the weſtern part of the ſtate of New York. There was, at that time, a diſorder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent there, of the ſame nature with that which I found riſe in Sheffield, on my return, and which I am about to deſcribe. It was chiefly exiſtent in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of ſtagnant waters, and in ſituations ſimilar to thoſe places, in this town, to which the diſeaſe was moſt confined. The treatment required was, of courſe, the ſame.</p>
               <p>On my return to Sheffield, which was the 5th. of September, I found a number of the inhabitants, about the North Pond, afflicted with a fever, which began to appear about three weeks before. The people firſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked were thoſe who lived neareſt to the pond; whole families of whom were down at once. Numbers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to be taken daily, chiefly within the vicinity of this pond, or within three quarters of a mile of its bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, till about the middle of October; after which time there were few inſtances of new attacks. In this time, i. e. from the 10th. of Auguſt to the 20th. of October, of about 200 (which is not far from the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of perſons living within three quarters of a mile of ſome of the borders of this pond) not leſs than 150 were affected with more or leſs of this diſeaſe; out of which number, but one perſon died, and that an aged man, previouſly debilitated and diſordered.—The number affected with this fever, in all other parts of this town, did not, I believe, exceed thirty. Of theſe, three died: one, an aged woman; the other two, preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant women, of whom one died in the fever, the other ſuffered an abortion, and died ſome months after, dropſical.</p>
               <p>The diſeaſe, this year, put on a different form to what it did the laſt. It might, with more propriety be called an intermittent, than a remittent fever; though it was very different from a common fever and ague.
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:033590_0087_0FF7949283957EE8"/>
It began, like other fevers, with an ague fit, attended with pains in the head, back and limbs. The duration of this part of the paroxiſm was uncertain. It was ſucceeded by a hot fit, whoſe duration was, in different perſons, from ſix to forty eight hours. A remiſſion, and, ſometimes, nearly or quite, a perfect intermiſſion, then came on; but whoſe duration was as irregular and uncertain as was that of the paroxiſm before. After the firſt, the paroxiſms were not generally uſhered in by a regular ague fit; only ſome ſlight chills were felt; and theſe were irregular, both in degree and continuance. The length of the next ſucceeding paroxiſms and intervals could, by no means, be calculated for, from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding, ſo completely irregular was this diſorder. The fever evidently tended to an intermittent form; but it could neither be called quotidian, tertian, quartan, nor by any other name uſed by authors to diſtinguiſh the different ſpecies of intermitting fevers. The pains in the head, limbs and back, were very fevere, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in the latter, which were ſo univerſally intenſe, that the ſymptom might almoſt be conſidered as charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſtic of the diſorder. In the primae viae, flatulency was nearly a conſtantly attendant and very troubleſome ſymptom. Evidences of an increaſed ſecretion and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of bile, were generally preſent through the diſeaſe, but were particularly obſervable in the conva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſcence. Some degree of yellowneſs of the ſkin, which was almoſt univerſal, indicated a reabſorption of this fluid, and a depoſition of it upon the ſkin. This yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowneſs was in two inſtances which I ſaw, very intenſe. A ſlight degree of delirium was very common, during the height of the fever. The appearance of the tongue was much the ſame that it was laſt year.</p>
               <p>My method of treating the fever of this year, was ſimilar to that which I employed the laſt year.—Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, in the beginning, and afterwards a plentiful uſe of the bark, appeared to me to be the moſt ſucceſsful way of managing it. In extreme caſes, particularly, a free and full exhibition of bark, wine and laudanum, ſeemed the only means of ſalvation. It was abſolutely neceſſary that the patient ſhould be thoroughly purged,
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:033590_0088_0FF7949674B7DD68"/>
previous to the uſe of ſtimulants, otherwiſe the bark, wine, or laudanum, would have very pernicious effects. I ſaw ſeveral inſtances, at the weſtward, where, by too early a uſe of theſe medicines, the fever was changed into a continued form, attended with a conſtantly dry and yellow ſkin, comatoſe ſymptoms, &amp;c. One of the inſtances of extreme yellowneſs, which I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, was of this kind, and at the weſtward. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved this ſymptom, and recovered the patient, by giving repeated doſes of calomel and jalap, ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirative medicines, and afterwards the bark, wine, &amp;c. Each purge in this caſe, leſſened the degree of yellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs very apparently. The other inſtance of intenſe yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowneſs, which I ſaw, was in this town, in the caſe of the pregnant woman, whom I have mentioned to have died in the fever. This woman's fever never had diſtinct intermiſſions. Several ſlight attempts were made to adminiſter the bark; but it would not do. Perhaps my timidity in the evacuants, on account of her ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was injurious to her.</p>
               <p>The Bark did not ſuſpend the paroxiſms, in this diſorder, in as ſhort a time as it does in common inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittents; but, if the patient was properly prepared, and the uſe of it was perſevered in, it never failed to have the effect.</p>
               <p>Purging was probably uſeful in a twofold way: Firſt by carrying off the ſuperfluous bile; which was evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſecreted and excreted in a preternatural quantity: Secondly, by reducing the ſthenic diatheſis, which was perhaps always preſent in the early ſtage of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order.</p>
               <p>It is true, that thoſe whoſe fever was ſuſpended by the bark, were ſubject to frequent relapſes, and to a long and lingering ſtate of convaleſcence. This drew an odium upon that medicine; and many were indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to believe that it was owing to the uſe of it that people were ſo long in recovering, and of courſe, that it was improper. I am convinced, however, from very attentive obſervation, that thoſe who did not take the bark, but ſuffered the fever gradually to wear away, as it ſometimes would, were equally ſubject to thoſe
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:033590_0089_0FF794982DB6E180"/>
inconveniences. Indeed this ſeems to be the nature of the diſeaſe, The old people in this town, who recollect the times when diſorders of this kind have prevailed here before, and when the bark was not at all uſed, inform me that thoſe who were afflicted with them, were a long time in recovering.</p>
               <p>It ſeems that in all caſes, when patients have got rid of the fever, either by means of the bark, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, there remains an increaſed diſpoſition to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and excretion of bile, and that this humor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulates in the primae viae, till it firſt deſtroys the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite and occaſions nauſea, and then excites a ſponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous diſcharge by ſtool or vomiting, or a relapſe of fever, or both. A continuance in the uſe of ſome lax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ative medicine, after a recovery, has a tendency to prevent theſe effects; and, if ſtrictly attended to, would probably prevent them, and perhaps obviate the diſpoſition to relapſe entirely.</p>
               <p>In reflecting on phenomena of this kind, the human mind is anxious to fix on ſomething ſatisfactory as their cauſes. <hi>Specific contagion, I am convinced, was in no inſtance which came under my obſervation, either here or at the weſtward, the cauſe of the propagation of the diſorder.</hi> That marſh effluvia, to whoſe action the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of ſome parts of this town are ſubject, is the exciting cauſe, and is neceſſary to the production of the diſorders in queſtion, is beyond any manner of doubt. This is evident from their exiſting only where this influence extends. But ſomething more is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; otherwiſe we cannot account for their prevailing in ſome years, and not in others. Every circumſtance relative to the ponds <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>I have endeavoured to diſcover the cauſe why the ſickneſs in 1794, was confined almoſt entirely to the South, and in 1795, to the North-Pond; but I can find no local circumſtances to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſted which ſhould produce ſickneſs about one, and not about the other, in either of theſe years.</p>
                     <p>It is probable this was owing to the different direction of the winds, at the different periods when the fever occurred.</p>
                     <p>W. C.</p>
                  </note> and marſhes in this town, has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:033590_0090_0FF79499C8572D78"/>
been the ſame for many years paſt; and yet very little of this form of diſeaſe has appeared, for ten or twelve years back, until the two laſt. We muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuppoſe a peculiar conſtitution of the atmoſphere, occaſioning a prediſpoſition to theſe diſorders, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inciding with the local cauſe, or marſh effluvia; or that the marſh effluvia itſelf is, by ſome peculiarity of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere, wrought up to a higher pitch of virulence, and thus produces a higher degree of diſeaſe. I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to admit the latter ſuppoſition, as I am convinced that the fevers which have prevailed here for two or three years paſt, and the common intermittent fever, are the ſame, only differing in degree. I have ſeen all degrees, from the mildeſt form of intermittent, to the moſt extreme of bilious remitting fever. It is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſay where the line of diviſion ſhall be drawn. The diſeaſe this year ſeems to have formed a connecting link between intermittent and bilious fever; and were I to name it, I would call it a bilious intermittent. Should the intermittent fever, in its uſual form, prevail next year, the diſorder may be ſaid in the three years, to have been in regular gradations run through.</p>

               <head>EXTRACT OF A LETTER FROM <hi>DR. THEODORE JOHNSON</hi> OF EASTON, TALBOT COUNTY, <hi>TO THE AUTHOR,</hi> DATED MAY 16TH. 1794.</head>
               <p>"BEFORE I give you a detail of the diſeaſes which prevailed with us laſt ſummer and autumn, it may not be improper to give you ſome idea of the ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of Talbot, and a deſcription of the ſeaſon which preceded the ſickly one, as it is a well known fact, that a prediſpoſition to certain diſeaſes, are frequently ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated in one ſeaſon, and the diſeaſes produced in another.</p>
               <p>This county is bounded on the weſt by the Cheſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peak, and is variouſly interſected by perhaps, as great a number of rivers and large creeks, as any in the Union, ſome of which extend for many miles into the country eaſtward, and are freſh ſome miles from their ſource. The country near the bay ſide in general is much the moſt healthy, but (as you will readily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,) is much the moſt affected by winds. The eaſterly and north-eaſterly winds, paſſing over the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>healthy parts of this peninſula, uſually take up and carry the ſeeds of fevers with them; inſomuch that when theſe winds prevail, the bay ſide is often as ſickly as any other part of the country.</p>
               <p>Laſt ſpring was very wet, and the months of May and June were marked by the exceſs, both in fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency and quantity of rain; in conſequence of which
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:033590_0092_0FF77DF92C6A3188"/>
the crops of hay, &amp;c. were larger than has been known for many years.</p>
               <p>Part of July and Auguſt, was uncommonly warm.</p>
               <p>We had comparatively few caſes of fever in July, but early in Auguſt more people than I ever knew, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of different degrees of indiſpoſition, from a ſenſe of laſſitude to an intermittent fever. I really thought the remitting bilious fever (if it may be ſo called) was alſo more frequent, and more malignant, than I had ever ſeen it before. In ſome caſes the vomiting was ſo violent, as to bring away large quantities of blood from the extremely relaxed exhalents of the ſtomach. I had one remarkable caſe of this kind, which termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated favourably: I have no unequivocal proofs that this fever was contagious, but am inclined to think it was, when it run into the typhus type, and exhibited ſymptoms of malignancy.</p>
               <p>The dyſentery moſt generally occurs here in autumn, when fevers of various types abound. It does not always keep pace with the autumnal fevers, yet I am diſpoſed to think it only a different modification of the ſame diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, as they are often very much intermixed, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally happen at the ſame ſeaſon, and both appear to be derived from miaſmata.</p>
               <p>Laſt year there did not appear to be any great uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, in the appearance of the dyſentery, with the fevers that prevailed; but I rather conceived it was more influenced by diet, and the ſenſible qualities of the atmoſphere.</p>
               <p>May not the action of cold, or ſome error in diet, co-operating with miaſmata and other ſedative cauſes, occaſion the diſeaſe to fall with more force upon the bowels, than the reſt of the ſyſtem, without the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of which, it would have aſſumed the common type of an intermittent? Or would you call this a ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomatic affection? I am confident I once took a true idiopahic dyſentery, from getting extremely wet and cold, on being previouſly indiſpoſed, at a time when autumnal fevers were rife, which always impreſſed Sydenham's idea very ſtrongly upon my mind."</p>

               <head>EXTRACT OF A LETTER FROM <hi>DRS. TAYLOR AND HANSFORD,</hi> TO THE AUTHOR, RELATIVE TO THE REMITTING FEVER WHICH OCCURS AT NORFOLK, ON THE CHESAPEAK BAY IN VIRGINIA, <hi>AND THE ADJACENT COUNTRY.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE country around Norfolk is low land, moſtly within twelve feet of the level of the ſea, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſected in all directions with ſalt-creeks and rivers, the heads of which form ſwamps and marſhes, and fenny grounds covered with water in wet ſeaſons. Wherever it is not cultivated, the land is covered with large tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and thick underwood. The vicinity of the ſea, and the ſalt-creeks and rivers, occaſion a conſtant moiſture and warmth of the atmoſphere, inſomuch, that although under the ſame latitude a hundred miles up the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, deep ſnows and frozen rivers are very common during the winter, yet here we conſider ſuch occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences as extraordinary; for theſe reaſons, the ſpring is very early uſhered in, ſometimes ſo early, that many trees are in bloom about the latter end of February; from this time, however, till the end of April we are ſubject to cold rains, piercing winds, and ſharp froſts.</p>
               <p>About the middle of May, the weather becomes ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, with ſome cool days, occaſioned by the change of winds to the north and north-eaſt: At this period all the diſeaſes of the winter begin to decline, and the

whole country is univerſally healthy (except here and there a trifling vernal intermittent which ſcarce requires the application of medicine) till the middle or latter end of June, when diarrhoeas and dyſenteries appear among the children, moſtly with thoſe under two years old, though not abſolutely confine I to ſuch.</p>
               <p>In ſome years the diarrhoea is almoſt univerſal, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the moſt part with an irritation of the ſtomach, and an irregular fever of the intermittent kind: After the proper evacuations, we apply bark in large quantities, joined to the moſt approved aſtringents and anodynes, gum kino, opium, ſpec. e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſcord. &amp;c. and when the ſtomach will not bear a ſufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of bark, we throw it up in gliſters repeatedly, for many days together, and this we have learnt, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, to be the only mode which can be depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on.</p>
               <p>In July, the heat of the weather increaſes; but dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole of this month and the greateſt part of Auguſt, there are no diſeaſes at all, at leaſt none which can be called epidemic. On the approach of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumnal months, intermittents begin to appear through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the country.</p>
               <p>It is not our province here to recapitulate the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral opinions concerning the cauſe and nature of thoſe fevers, nor yet to divide them into numberleſs ſpecies and genera. We have never been able to diſtinguiſh any other difference in the nature of intermittents, than that which conſtitution, climate, and manner of living give riſe to; thoſe cauſes will divide them into perfect, imperfect, or remittent: The ſeveral termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of them which we frequently obſerve into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, putrid, or nervous fevers, will be found to ariſe from the ſame cauſes, and under thoſe ſimple terms we ſhall proceed to treat of intermittents in all their ſtages.</p>
               <p>Thoſe which occur earlieſt in the ſeaſon are uniform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the mildeſt kind, and yield ſooneſt to the proper medicines. Among the labouring and temperate claſs of our citizens, whoſe diet is ſimple, whoſe hours are regular, and whoſe uſe of ſpirituous liquors is ſparing,
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:033590_0095_0FF794A72BC7BBB0"/>
thoſe fevers are perfect intermittents, generally of the tertian kind, and though not confined particularly to any age or ſex, yet are moſt frequent among the younger claſs, the females and the children; they are in wet ſeaſons almoſt general among thoſe of the latter deſcription in country places, and in low fenny ground. They yield immmediately to proper evacuations, and the uſe of the Peruvian bark, and ſeldom outlaſt the autumna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> months, even without the aſſiſtance of any art: Sometimes, however, in relaxed habits, they ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate in jaundice, enlarged ſpleen, anaſarca, and death. We ſhall not be particular upon this ſort of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termittents, becauſe they are in nothing different from thoſe which prevail in all countries ſimilarly ſituated.</p>
               <p>Among that claſs of citizens, whoſe hours are more irregular, and whoſe uſe of wine and luxurious food is more frequent, thoſe fevers, though ſtill retaining the intermittent, quotidian, and tertian form, are neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs impefectly ſo; a great degree of heat, quickneſs of pulſe, and debility remain during the whole time, which may be called intermiſſion, with partial or total loſs of appetite. Here intermittents begin to put on an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, which we think very different from thoſe of any other country; they are preceded by a chillineſs, which commonly ſeizes the patient when he thinks himſelf in perfect health. Head-ach, great thirſt and heat ſoon follow, in many inſtances delirium, vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, diarrhoea, and large diſcharges of bile;—about the fifth, ſeventh, or twelfth hour the patient is reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by profuſe ſweat, which continues with the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned heat, quickneſs of pulſe, and debility, till the next paroxiſm. Theſe are generally of the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian kind, and return regularly if no medicine is uſed, from nine to fourteen days, when they will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly terminate altogether, or degenerate into a ſlight quotidian, which allows the patient to walk about, and when the cold weather approaches, for the moſt part, leave him altogether.</p>
               <p>People of the latter deſcription are more rarely the ſubjects of intermittent fevers than thoſe who live in a plain manner; and if proper evacuations are made, and
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:033590_0096_0FF794A9A6656050"/>
the bark adminiſtered with perſeverance, and attention to the ſtomach and firſt paſſages, the diſeaſe may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt certainly be cured after the third paroxiſm, and very often even a ſecond is prevented.</p>
               <p>We have always experienced cathartics to be the ſafeſt and moſt effectual evacuations in thoſe kinds of fevers; and if the patient has an irritated ſtomach with coſtiveneſs, emetics are not only inadequate and unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary but dangerous. We frequently find great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in making the ſtomach bear a ſufficient quantity of cathartic medicines to procure the deſired evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: when this is the caſe, laudanum and aqua men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thae, or extract. thebaic. are adminiſtered an hour or two before the purge, which generally cauſes the latter to remain, and though the opiate retards the operation, it does not ultimately prevent it, or render it leſs pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fter this we proceed to the uſe of the bark during the intermiſſions, and without regard to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, give it as profuſely as the ſtomach will permit, and in the moſt powerful form, beginning with the powder, and occaſionally uſing the decoction, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, and cold infuſion. It too often happens, that the ſtomach will not bear the medicine at all, in which caſe we give large quantities of the decoction or infuſion by clyſters; and we can venture to aſſert, when thoſe clyſters are retained in ſufficient quantity, the effect is equal to that produced by any other mode of adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering it. During the paroxiſm, we find great relief procured, by making the patient drink plentifully of a ſtrong infuſion of ſerpent. virgin. to which, when the ſymptoms are very painful, we add laudanum in ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient quantity to procure the patient perfect eaſe. Theſe laſt medicines, particularly the ſerpent. have a viſible power of ſhortening the paroxyiſm, and will rarely diſagree with the ſtomach. The uſe of opium, its ſafety and advantage in thoſe caſes, we preſume to be well known; therefore we ſhall decline making any obſervations upon it, except that we have not found it (as has been aſſerted) capable <hi>per ſe,</hi> of curing inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittents. It has been adviſed to give it in conjunction with the ſeveral preparations of bark, where the irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:033590_0097_0FF794AB51AE13C8"/>
ſtate of the ſtomach will not bear the cort. alone. This expedient will ſucceed, if the quantity from time to time be increaſed, and is often uſed with ſucceſs, though it invariably occaſions great diſtreſs to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient when the fever leaves him, by inducing an h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical or hypochondriacal ſenſation, which if it does not amount to pain, the patient will tell you his feelings are far worſe than if it did.</p>
               <p>The uſe of this medicine to prevent the paſſage of the bark by ſtool is known to every one; but we think the gum. kino for general uſe much better, and more permanent in its effects.</p>
               <p>At the acceſſion of thoſe fevers there is frequently a full hard pulſe, inflamed eyes, a ſenſe of fullneſs in the breaſt, and ſometimes a ſharp pain in the ſide, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling that which attends inflammatory fevers. Theſe circumſtances have often led practitioners, and others who are not acquainted with the climate, to bleed the patient; an expedient, which if it does not produce a tendency to putrefaction, invariably fixes the fever ſo firmly, that the cure becomes afterwards exceedingly difficult.</p>
               <p>When no medicines are given at all, we have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved before, that the fever for the moſt part will decline of itſelf on the ninth or fourteenth day, or degenerate into a ſlight quotidian, and ſometimes a quartan; this is, however, not always the caſe.</p>
               <p>If no medicine has been given, or if the diſeaſe has been improperly treated by bleeding, or by too great evacuations, otherwiſe by forbidding the uſe of wine, &amp;c. the fever ſometimes becomes remittent.</p>
               <p>In the town we have alſo many of theſe fevers, which though clearly belonging to the claſs of intermittents, appear in the form of remittents; becauſe, there is an evident tendency to decline of the fever at a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular time, once in twenty-four hours, every other day, or every fourth day, and all the diagnogſtic ſymptoms are preciſely the ſame as they are in diſtinct intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, making allowance for age, ſex, and conſtitution; nor do the means of cure differ, though variouſly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="unknown:033590_0098_0FF794ACEEF7A6B0"/>In the town, throughout the months of September and October, many of the inhabitants are ſeized with fevers, which begin with chillineſs, a ſenſe of fulneſs in the ſtomach, followed by pains throughout the limbs, neck, back, and hips, great heat and proſtration of ſtrength, which proceed and terminate as before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, under the term of imperfect intermittents. But others who are attacked in the ſame manner, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly robuſt and plethoric habits, or thoſe who are accuſtomed to drink a great deal of wine, porter, &amp;c. and take plentifully of luxurious food, have a greater ſenſe of heat, more pain in the limbs, and much more oppreſſion and debility—are extremely reſtleſs, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with delirium, and great thirſt; and when the period of intermiſſion of the fever ſhould arrive, viz. the ninth or twelfth hour, are but partially relieved, that is, the ſenſe of heat is not ſo great, the delirium and reſtleſſneſs are ſomewhat abated, and there are ſome few ſtrokes difference in the pulſe; and when there is nauſea and vomiting, thoſe likewiſe partly ceaſe to torment the patient, but the proſtration of ſtrength, pain in the limbs, &amp;c. with the dry ſkin, ſtill remain: Here the evacuation by cathartics ſhould be attempted without delay, and the period of the remiſſion (which though obſcure, laſts ſeveral hours) employed in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtering bark in every poſſible form, without regard to the quickneſs of pulſe and dry ſkin; wine ſhould be given in large quantities, and on the return of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxiſm, the patient ſhould drink profuſely of an infuſion of ſerpentar. with wine.</p>
               <p>When this plan is followed with perſeverance, the patient almoſt always recovers, though the paroxiſm, or properly ſpeaking, the violent hours of the fever, may return once or twice; but if this is neglected, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſecond return, the fever puts on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> malignant and putrid type, and often ends in death.</p>
               <p>We have ſometimes found it impracticable to make the patient keep the bark in any form, or by any mode of giving it; when this is the caſe, the diſeaſe is always dangerous, and the only expedient we have left is the uſe of wine and ſerpentar. and we have ſo many times
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:033590_0099_0FF79586D30260F8"/>
experienced the advantage of this laſt medicine, by giving it in a large quantity, that we cannot help earneſtly recommending it to the notice of every prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioner.</p>
               <p>It is a medicine, though of known efficacy, very much neglected, at leaſt the proper adminiſtration of it; like the bark, it cannot be given in too large a quantity, when the ſtomach will bear it. The fevers of the latter deſcription are leſs common than the others.</p>
               <p>When the diſeaſe begins to yield to the medicine, a profuſe ſweat comes on; the pulſe grows full, ſlow, and ſoft; the ſenſe of heat and pain in the limbs, back, hips, and neck abate and gradually ſubſide; the patient has a deſire to ear, and in a few days he feels nothing but a debility, which is far from being ſo great as the violence of the diſeaſe would give cauſe to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, and a very little time reſtores him to perfect health and vigour.</p>
               <p>When it is about to terminate unfavourably, there is an increaſed irritation of the ſtomach, with vomiting of cyſtic bile, mixed with tough mucus, attended in ſome caſes with diarrhoea, the pulſe grows ſmaller, quicker, and intermits, or rather ſeems at times to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat from the finger while feeling it; the countenance falls, the eyes become gloſſy, the tongue black and dry, the teeth cemented over with a black mucilaginous ſubſtance, cold extremities, and death; the pulſe, however, is never to be depended upon in the termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of theſe fevers; it is ſometimes ſo hard, full, and regular, even at the moment that every other ſymptom evinces the approach of death, that inexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced practitioners would be often induced to bleed or evacuate when the patient is expiring.</p>
               <p>When continued fevers from intermittents take place, they are generally confined to relaxed, debilitated, or debauched habits; they are far from being common with us, and as in every other country, they either ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate on the twenty-firſt day, or lengthen out into what are called nervous fevers, we ſhall neither treat of this ſtage of the diſorder, or pretend to point out a mode of cure, for whatever may be the prediſpoſing
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:033590_0100_0FF77E0329AAC750"/>
cauſe, the diſeaſe is invariably the ſame, and requires the ſame mode of tretament in every country. We muſt, however, take notice of one effect which ſome intermittents produce, viz. a debility or affection of the optic nerve, ſo as to render the patient perfectly blind, till the bark and other tonics, have removed the fever, when thoſe patients recover their ſight with health.</p>

               <p>HIPPOCRATES, (who practiſed medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine in Greece, about four hundred and fifty years before the Chriſtian aera, and who was the firſt that we have on record, that reduced the healing art to any kind of ſyſtem) has deſcribed a bilious fever, under the title of typhus,<note n="*" place="bottom">Typhus is employed by the moderns to ſignify a malignant or putrid fever.</note> which he ſays invades, when the <hi>bile</hi> is moved through the body when the dog ſtar ariſes in the ſummer time. In this diſeaſe immediately an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe burning was felt, together with an acute fever; and immediately the ſtrength was exhauſted, with a weakneſs and heavineſs of the body, and ſuch an impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency of the legs and arms that they were of no uſe to the patient. He alſo remarks that the belly was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed with violent gripings, and evacuations of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive excrements. The remedies recommended by this celebrated and venerable phyſician in the cure of this fever, were cold, and thin ſuppings, black auſtere wine, or if that diſagreed, white auſtere thin wine. He alſo

adviſes the application of linen cloths dipt in cooling liquors to thoſe parts of the body where the greateſt heat is principally perceived<note n="*" place="bottom">Vanſwieten's Comment. Vol. 7th. page 23.</note>
               </p>
               <p>This extraordinary phyſician collected together the ſigns that occur and appeared to be characteriſtic of every diſeaſe that came under his notice, and by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring them with what he obſerved in a natural ſtate of health, eſtimated the danger in proportion to the degree that thoſe ſigns of diſeaſe departed from a ſtate of health. If the phyſicians ſince his time had been content to have learned the treatment of diſeaſes from a faithful obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the effects of remedies inſtead of puzzling their heads with reſearches into their intimate cauſes, the healing art would not have been ſubjected at this time to the opprobrium of a conjectural art.</p>
               <p>Eraſiſtratus, a phyſician diſtinguiſhed for certain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations in the treatment of diſeaſes, two hundred years later than the Coan ſage, Aſclepiades and his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple Themiſon, who practiſed medicine with reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at Rome a few years before the introduction of Chriſtianity into the world, were all enemies to blood-letting in fevers. Believing the diſeaſe to depend upon a ſtraitneſs of the minute or extreme veſſels of the body, and eſpecially on the ſurface, their practice was to prohibit the uſe of all kind of aliment for the firſt three days, and to drench the patient with copious draughts of water to relax and render the veſſels per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meable.</p>
               <p>Hippocrates remarks that one ſhould open a vein in acute diſeaſes, if the diſorder appears violent if the patient is in the vigour of his age, and the ſtrength at that time is alſo conſiderable<note n="†" place="bottom">Vanſwieten's Comenmt. Vol. 7th. page 196.</note>

               <p>Serapion who made his appearance about the ſame period as Eriſiſtrates, was the founder of the empyric ſect, as the latter was of the methodic. His followers were numerous, and many of them reſpectable; but we have no account of their practice in the fever under

conſideration. The ſummary view of Celſus, or the accidental fragments in the volumnious works of Galen, furniſh only imperfect information. Contentions how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ran high between the Dogmatiſts and Empirics, the former of whom, were chiefly guided by reaſonings; and generally miſled by the erroneous philoſophy of the age in which they lived, while the latter truſted ſolely to experience.</p>
               <p>Celſus, who lived in the reign of Tiberius, ſays, "Blood-letting is required when the fever is violent, and the body looks red, or the veins ſwell, and appear full."—Celſus however, makes no mention of venae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſection, where he treats of the cure of an ardent fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, by which term the antients underſtood a diſeaſe ſimilar in almoſt, or perhaps in every reſpect, to the malignant yellow fever of the Weſt Indies of peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial origin, as appears from the deſcription of the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, and period of its termination, given in Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate's Epidemics, the ſubſtance of which, is delivered in Vanſwieten's Commentaries, Vol. 7th. p. 96.</p>
               <p>In continual fevers, with ſymptoms denoting inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, it was the practice of Galen, who left Perga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos and ſettled in Rome about the year 160, to bleed the patient till he fainted, with the view of extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing the fever at once. In this kind of fevers, he expreſsly adviſes blood-letting and the drinking of cold liquors. But he has made no mention of blood-letting, in intermittent or remittent fevers.</p>
               <p>Neither Aetius, nor Paulus Aegineta, who lived after Galen: The latter in the 7th. century, and has given an analyſis of the opinions and practice of the prolix com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentator of Hippocrates, make any mention of opening a vein, either in the remitting, or ardent fever, as they term the ſynochus.—But Aroeteus, a cotem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary of Aetius, treating of the cure of a ſyncope, the beginning of which he pronounced an ardent fever; recommends venaeſection, when the ſyncope proceeds from too great a quantity of blood, and ſome conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable inflammation appears about the liver, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordia. He however ſubjoins, that "much leſs blood ought to be evacuated, than upon other occaſions,
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:033590_0104_0FF794B68B1C9AC0"/>
becauſe the leaſt error committed in this reſpect, may be of fatal conſequence."</p>
               <p>Avicenna, the Arabian, who practiſed medicine at Iſpahan, the capital of Perſia; and compiled a Treatiſe on Diſeaſes, from the works of Galen, in the 10th. century. His theories are thoſe of Galen: In the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral conduct of the cure, he follows him cloſely. He is indeed more reſerved with the lancet, while he is not always conſiſtent with himſelf, in the manner of employing it.</p>
               <p>The healing art, after the ſurrender of Alexandria, was little cultivated by the ſlothful and diſpirited Greeks, but it ſprung up with freſh vigour, in Syria and Arabia, and being extended with the conqueſts of the Saracens, it was introduced into the northern coaſt of Africa, and from thence was introduced into Spain and Italy.</p>
               <p>After the fall of the Roman Empire, the genius of learning made no exertion in Europe, for a very long period of time. The Europeans were content, with the imperfect knowledge they could glean from the writings of Avicenna.—And part of the 16th. century paſſed over, before any real improvements were made in the treatment of fevers.</p>
               <p>Among the moſt celebrated of the followers of Galen in the 16th. century, were Fernelius, Foreſtus, Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius, and Sennertus; men of conſiderable talents, but too ſtrongly attached to the opinions of their maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to exerciſe their own judgments to the beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
               <p>Lommius in particular, we are aſſured by Dr. Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſon, (in his Remark's on Dr. Ruſh's Works,) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended the uſe of blood-letting in the beginning of fevers in adults, and in whom vigour naturally abounds; but he reckoned it dangerous to repeat it in the exacerbation, or height of the paroxiſm.—When the patients ſtrength is not much exhauſted, but purely a little diminiſhed, with lowneſs of ſpirits; venaeſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is neither to be entirely omitted, nor the quantity of blood drawn, to be copious. The length of the intervals is to be regulated by the ſtrength of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:033590_0105_0FF794BADB30FFA0"/>
and the violence of the diſeaſe. In great weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs however, the lancet is to be entirely withheld, eſtimating this condition principally from the ſituation of the vital powers; while conſiderable caution is to be uſed in judging from the pulſe, as it is liable to be affected by a variety of circumſtances, which are often totally unconnected with the diſeaſe. The quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity to be drawn, ſhould depend upon the reſult of a compariſon between the diſeaſe, and the ſtrength of the patient.</p>
               <p>In a violent fever, if the patient's ſtrength be not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, Lommius adviſes a liberal evacuation of blood, and juſtifies the practice of Galen, of bleeding, in ſuch caſes till the patient faints, on the principle that the ſudden depletion brings the patient directly to a ſtate, different from what he had been in juſt before, whilſt he may be revived from the ſyncope, by refrigerating means.</p>
               <p>Botallus, who alſo lived in the 16th. century, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried blood-letting to ſtill greater lengths, eſpecially in peſtilential fevers, in which he aſſerts, as quoted by Sydenham, that he found no ſpeedier, and ſafer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy in peſtilential diſorders, than copious and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable bleedings; in all his patients, which were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding numerous, both at the ſiege of Rochel, at Mons, and at Paris.</p>
               <p>Sydenham himſelf had a high opinion of copious and repeated blood-letting in the plague, as well as in all inflammatory diſorders; but he prohibits it in every form of the autumnal intermitting fever, even when concealed at the beginning, under the maſk of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued fever.</p>
               <p>"Autumual intermittents when the conſtitution is epidemic uſually appear about June, but otherwiſe not till Auguſt, or the beginning of September, and very rarely in the following months. It is likewiſe to be noted, that it is a difficult matter at the firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of intermittents, eſpecially of thoſe that are epidemic in autumn, to diſtinguiſh them exactly; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe at this time they are accompanied with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued fever; and for ſome time afterwards, unleſs
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:033590_0106_0FF794BC6A82F328"/>
great attention be given, nothing more than a remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion can be diſcovered; but by degrees they perfectly intermit, and put on a form entirely agreeable to the ſeaſon of the year." (Swan's Sydenham, p. 55.)</p>
               <p>"Frequent experience has taught me," adds Dr. Sydenham, "that it is very dangerous to attempt the cure (of autumnal intermittents) by purging; unleſs in a way hereafter mentioned, and eſpecially by bleeding. For in tertians, particularly in a very epidemic conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if bleeding does not prove a preſent cure, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs the diſeaſe even in young, ſtrong, and otherwiſe healthy ſubjects; but aged perſons, after having long ſtruggled with it, are deſtroyed thereby. What has been obſerved of bleeding, holds alſo of purging, with this difference only, that the latter is leſs dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, unleſs it be frequently repeated." (Page 59.) Boerhaave and Vanſwieten have both adopted the ſame opinion. (Com. Vol. 7th.)</p>
               <p>In treating of the epidemic diſeaſes, from the year 1675 to 1680, the ſame author obſerves, that "though tertians and quotidians, after a fit or two may ſeem en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to intermit, yet they frequently afterwards de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate into a kind of continued fevers, and only come to a remiſſion on thoſe days that promiſed an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, &amp;c. In this caſe I ſeize the opportunity of the remiſſion, though it be ever ſo ſhort, and give the bark more liberally during that interval, than when the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion is perfect" (Page 310.)</p>
               <p>The moſt common termination of fevers, is by ſweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; this fact was obſerved by Van-Helmont, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed him with the deſign of proſecuting the cure of the diſeaſe, entirely on that plan. This practice ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to have been early adopted in many parts of Europe, and was in general reputation in England, at the time Sydenham engaged in practice. Syden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham having obſerved the bad effects of heating medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, employed indiſcriminately for this purpoſe, was induced to employ antiphlogiſtic proceſſes, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially venaeſection, which he carried to a conſiderable extent, particularly in fevers accompanied with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:033590_0107_0FF794BE26260590"/>
diatheſis, or connected with local inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
               <p>But as it is the fate of the healing art, as well as every other, that depends upon opinion, to paſs with large ſtrides from one extreme to its oppoſite. Syden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham frequently employed his depleting remedies, in caſes which later and more numerous obſervations, demonſtrate that they were improper. His practice was always at open war with his principles; for if the fever as he believed, is an effort of nature to exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate ſomething hurtful from the conſtitution, bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and thoſe evacuations, which diminiſh the powers of life, are not the proper means of effecting this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. In admitting ſuch eſſential differences in the cauſe of epidemics, he alſo neceſſarily leads us into embarraſſment, and often leaves us in a ſtate of uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty; the fevers which he ſuppoſes to be eſſentially dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, and occaſioned by different conſtitutions of the atmoſphere, is in fact the common endemic of London, and the adjacent country, diverſified as in other places by the ſeaſon, ſoil ſtate of the weather, conſtitutions of the inhabitants, and idioſyncraſies of individuals. Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances ariſe in all countries, which modify the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral cauſe of intermittent fevers, hence the diſeaſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears at one time with ſymptoms of in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Baglivi, who publiſhed his Obſervations on the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of Rome, in the year 1696, ſays, that "The air at Rome, which is hemmed in by ſeven hills, is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally moiſt and impure, particularly in autumn, when the days are extremely hot, and the nights cool, and accompanied with heavy dews. At this ſeaſon, the air is alſo much impregnated with the exhalations from the low moiſt ground, and the waters which wash the ſoil in its vicinity. That city is alſo much infeſted with unwholeſome winds from the ſouth, ſouth-weſt, and ſouth-eaſt. The air is ſometimes ſo prodigiouſly hot, as to exhauſt all the moiſture of the ſoil, and to occaſion fevers of a very dangerous kind; the Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritaiae
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:033590_0108_0FF794C0A3698D40"/>
of Galen, in which ſymptoms reſembling apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy, were common. The air is particularly impure and unwholeſome, near the flat grounds along the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. But all the parts of the city, which ſtand high, and are thick ſettled, with a prospect to the north or eaſt, and are a conſiderable diſtance from the Tiber, are healthful. In the Campagnia di Roma, which is surrounded by a ridge of mountains in every direction, excepting a tract which extends towards the Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean, the air is ſo impure in autumn, when the ſouth wind prevails, that if the inhabitants of the city happen to remain there only one night, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the town, they are ſoon after ſeized with a fever accompanied with malignant ſymptoms, called the <hi>Foul Air Fever.</hi> In this fever, cordial and vinous me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, and bliſters, are very beneficial, but bleeding is extremely pernicious."</p>
               <p>About the beginning of the preſent century, when every department of ſcience, had arrived at a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able degree of improvement, there appeared in the writings of Stahl, of Hoffman, and of Boerhaave, three new and conſiderably different ſyſtems of phyſic, which for a conſiderable time had, and ſtill in many parts of Europe, have a conſiderable ſhare in directing the treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>Truſting much to the efforts of the animal ſyſtem, which they ſuppoſed were conducted with conſtant at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and wiſdom: Stahl and his diſciples have in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, propoſed only very inert and frivolous remedies, and are extremely reſerved in the uſe of blood-letting, vomits, &amp;c. in fevers.</p>
               <p>The celebrated Boerhaave, who was profeſſor of the theory and practice of phyſic, in the Univerſity of Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; in his Aphoriſms concerning the knowledge, and cure of intermittents, particularly at Section 762, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly ſays, "Hence blood-letting in theſe fevers, is in itſelf generally prejudicial, otherwiſe it may be of ſervice by accident, or in some caſes, as may be, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a thin and ſtrict diet."</p>
               <p>On this Aphoriſm, his learned and experienced commentator, the Baron Vanſwieten makes the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:033590_0109_0FF794C234953650"/>
among other remarks; "Since blood-letting is ſo efficacious a remedy in quieting the too great violence of a fever, as we ſaid before, many phyſicians have been likewiſe of opinion, that it may be of great uſe in the cure of intermitting fevers; and ſome have even believed, that theſe fevers might be removed only by repeated blood-letting. But ſince it was demonſtrated under the preceding Aphoriſm, that all evacuations if violent and repeated, are prejudicial becauſe they weaken, ſo the ſame is true likewiſe of blood-letting."</p>
               <p>IN the Syſtem of Medicine of Dr. Hoffman, late pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor at Hall in Saxony, publiſhed at Geneva in the year 1761, ſince tranſlated by the late Dr. Lewis, and publiſhed by Dr. Duncan; we have the following ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations on intermittents and remittents, &amp;c. Vol. 1ſt. p. 55, 56, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>"In the uncommonly hot and dry ſummers and autumns of 1726, 1727 and 1728, a variety of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malous, malignant intermittents were epidemic almoſt throughout Germany. Some ſuffered one, ſome two ſits a day. In ſome they were at firſt continual, and changed on the 3rd. or 4th. day into intermittents; in others they intermitted at firſt, and changed afterwards into dangerous continuals. In ſome there were exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive evacuations of bilious and pituitous matter, both upwards and downwards, in others conſtant ſweats, and faintneſs, during the remiſſions or intermiſſions. Some complained, during the fever, of heat and cold at the ſame time. Young perſons were ſometimes highly delirious in the paroxiſm; the aged sleepy: All com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of an anxiety and painful preſſure about the region of the ſtomach; a dull pain of the loins, feet and head, and in the time of intermiſſion, a pain in the nape of the neck, ſcapulae, and along the ſpine. At length puſtles breaking out on the face, or purple mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liary eruptions on the body, all the ſymptoms abated. if a ſorbutic miliary fever was joined, the diſeaſe
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:033590_0110_0FF794C4B3CB9520"/>
proved of longer continuance; if the eruptions were white, it was generally fatal.</p>
               <p>"Theſe fevers were moſt frequent in marſhy places; to perſons of an irregular life, or weak conſtitution; after bleeding, ſtrong purgatives, immoderate paſſions; and to women on the approach of the monthly period. Freedom of perſpiration, openneſs of the bowels, avoiding cold moiſt air and unwholeſome foods, were the ſureſt preſervatives. Some recovered in a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night; with others the diſeaſe laſted a month. Very few died, unleſs from ſome great miſmanagement.</p>

               <head>GENERAL METHOD OF CURE.</head>
               <p n="1">1. "In the beginning of the diſeaſe, ſmall doſes of nitre were given, both in the paroxiſms, and in the intermiſſions, along with ſome agreeable ſimple wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to which were added a few drops of ſpir. nit. dulc. or the mineral anodyne liquor. The common drink was water gruel, with lemon juice and lemon peel, or reduced with almonds, into the form of an emulſion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. "The belly, where coſtive, was looſened by gliſters of water-gruel, with cammomile flowers, oil of almonds, and common ſalt, and potions of mana and cream of Tartar. In ſome perſons, rhubarb anſwered better.</p>
               <p n="3">3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> "A ſweat was promoted at the end of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxiſms, where nature was too weak to effect it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out aſſiſtance, by ſaturated diaphoretic mixtures, mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with equal quantity of the anodyne liquor, and a few drops of volatile aromatic ſpirits.</p>
               <p n="4">4. "When, by theſe means, the fever had abated, and changed into a true intermittent, it was ſucceſsfully treated as ſuch. In ſome caſes, the bark was given at the beginning, after a gentle emetic, along with caſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilla, nitre and calx of antimony.</p>
               <p>"In theſe fevers ſtrong purgatives, and emetics did harm. <hi>Bleeding, acrids, ſudorifics,</hi> and all hot me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:033590_0111_0FF794C738F71970"/>
were apt to change the ſingle intermittents into double, or into continual fevers. Mild evacuants were ſerviceable.</p>
               <p>"When vomiting, reſtleſſneſs, and coolneſs of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities were urgent, a gentle diaphoreſis was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted by the mineral anoydine liquor, mixed with a few drops of volatile ſpirits, diſtilled oil of mace, or a ſmall quantity of the extract of ſaffron, and warm di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting drinks."</p>
               <p>SIR JOHN PRINGLE obſerves, that, "Though all moiſt countries are ſubject to intermittents, yet if the moiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be pure, and the ſummers are not cloſe and hot, the fevers will moſtly appear in a regular tertian form, and be eaſily cured. But if the moiſture ariſes from ſtagnating water, in which plants, fiſh, and inſects die and rot, then the damps being of a putrid nature, not only occaſion more frequent, but more dangerous fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, which oftener appear in the form of quotidians, or double tertians, than, in that of ſingle ones.</p>
               <p>Theſe marſh fevers are not only apt to begin with little remiſſion, but after intermitting for ſome days, to change again into continual fevers, with putrid and malignant ſymptoms.</p>
               <p>It is alſo remarkable how they vary with the ſeaſon; for however frequent, violent, or dangerous they have been in the decline of ſummer, or beginning of autumn, when putrid exhalations are moſt abundant, yet before winter, they are reduced to a ſmall number, become mild, and generally aſſume a regular tertian form.</p>
               <p>The firſt kind were obſerved in the campaign of the year 1747, to prevail near the inundations in Dutch Brabant; the next were thoſe of Zealand; of the 3d. degree, were thoſe in the lines of Bergan-op-Zoom; and the mildeſt ſort, were ſuch as were moſt frequent in the cantonments around Eyndhoven, in villages ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered moiſt by plantations, and ſubterraneous water.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="unknown:033590_0112_0FF794C8F80E6338"/>At the height of the epidemic it appeared, that both intermittents and remittents, by extending or doubling their paroxiſms, frequently changed into a continued, putrid and dangerous form, and that moſt of thoſe that were loſt, died in this way. But in general the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality was not in proportion to the number of the ſick, nor to the alarming nature of the ſymptoms. Although the diſtemper was violent, yet it yielded to medicine; and no kind of acute diſorder ſeemed to require it more. One of the moſt unfavourable circumſtances, was the proneneſs to a relapſe, the danger of which was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt during the hot weather, leſs in the decline of autumn, and leaſt of all after the froſts began.</p>
               <p>Frequent relapſes brought on viſceral obſtructions, which made the intermittents more obſtinate and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular, and terminate in a dropſy, or jaundice. (p. 182,) &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Fifteen hundred patients, the greateſt part with the dyſentery, and a number of wounded men, being crowded together in a hoſpital, 3 leagues from Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nau, vitiated the air, and gave riſe to a ſtill more alarming diſtemper, viz. the jail or hoſpital fever; the common effects of foul air from crowds and animal corruption. (p. 22). This fever, and the dyſentery grew daily worſe. Few eſcaped, for however mild or bad the flux was, for which the perſon was ſent to the hoſpital, this fever almoſt ſurely ſupervened.</p>
               <p>The petaechial ſpots, blotches, tumifaction of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotids, frequent mortifications, contagion, and the great mortality, ſufficiently ſhewed its peſtilential nature.</p>
               <p>Of fourteen mates employed about the ſick, five died; and excepting one or two, all the reſt had been ill and in danger. The hoſpital loſt near half of the patients; but the inhabitants of the village having firſt received the flux, and afterwards this fever by contagion, were almoſt entirely deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>One general hoſpital being eſtabliſhed at Newied, the ſick were removed from their ſeveral quarters, and carried down the Rhine to that place; where by the change of the air, thoſe from Feckenheim were at firſt relieved, but the reſt who were mixed with them caught
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:033590_0113_0FF794CB77296238"/>
the infection, which the following circumſtance ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ſtill more general and fatal. For orders coming ſoon after to remove all the ſick from Germany to Flanders, they were embarked in Bilanders, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed by water to Ghent.<note n="*" place="bottom">The Capital of Flanders.</note> During this voyage, the fever having acquired new force by the confinement of the air, by the mortification and other putrid effluvia, it became ſo virulent, that above half the number died in the boats, and ſeveral of the remainder ſoon after their arrival.</p>
               <p>The reſemblance of this hoſpital fever, to the true plague was further evinced, by the following memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble incident.<note n="†" place="bottom">The late malignant fever in Philadelphia, was occaſioned by a circumſtance very ſimilar to this recorded by Sir John Pringle, viz. by the light ſails made uſe of for bedding, by the crew of the ſhip Arethuſa from the Havanna; and also by thoſe of the armed ſhip Hind, from St. Domingo, which were put into ſhores and ſail lofts near the places where those veſſels anchored. W. C.</note> A parcel of old tents being ſent on board the ſame Bilanders with the men, were uſed by them for bedding: Theſe tents, in order to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitted were put into the hands of a tradeſman at Ghent, who having employed 23 Flemmiſh journeymen about the work, loſt 17 of them by the diſtemper, though they had no other communication with the infected."</p>
               <p>From theſe obſervations, and from the frequent no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice taken of the ſuppoſed contagious effects of the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentery, it is manifeſt that Sir John Pringle never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the remitting or intermitting fever to be propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by contagion; on the contrary, he expreſsly ſays, the circumſtance of the dyſentery being contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſhews that it is eſſentially different from theſe fevers.</p>
               <p>Sir John Pringle is of opinion from the ſymptoms and contagious nature of the peſtilential fever, which occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Imperial army in Hungary, A. D. 1566, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by Sennertus, (p. 254 Edit. 6th.) that it was a compound of the bilious and hoſpital fever, taking its riſe in the camp, but acquiring its high degree of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity

and contagious quality, from the foul air of the places in which the ſick were crowded.</p>
               <p>In his Obſervations on the treatment of the bilious remitting, and intermitting fevers of marſhy countries, Sir John Pringle remarks, that "In moſt caſes, it was neceſſary to open a vein, either upon the firſt attack, or the next day, if there was no intermiſſion. But re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated bleedings, unleſs upon evident marks of a fixed inflammation were ſo far from producing the deſired effect, that they ſeemed to render the fever more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate. It ought alſo to be remarked, that the rule about bleeding regards the ſoldiers only, and not the natives, whoſe conſtitutions were different from the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, who were not only young, but robuſt and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine. And even among the ſoldiers, bleeding was ſeldom neceſſary upon a relapſe, as the fever then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared without inflammation, and as a regular inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittent.</p>
               <p>An antimonial emetic generally rendered the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion more diſtinct. The marſh fever, during the hot ſeaſon, being more apt to run into double parox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſms or to change into a continued form, than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main regularly intermittent, it was neceſſary after due preparation to ſtop it in the firſt fair intermiſſion. And for this purpoſe, the bark was found to be no leſs ſpecific in thoſe parts than at home—and there was no ſecurity againſt relapſes, unleſs the patient took an ounce of the bark in powder, once every ten or twelve days throughout the autumn. The moſt effectual way to make a ſoldier continue the uſe of the bark, is to mix it with equal parts of brandy and water." Page 109, &amp; ſequent.</p>

The apyrexy is tolerably complete, though for the moſt part the patient complains of a diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able taste, loſs of appetite, head-ach, and pain in the ſmall of his back, and pit of his ſtomach upon a full inſpiration. The pulſe during the intermiſſion is almoſt natural: in the fits it varies according to their predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant ſymptoms: When they are attended by acute pains in the <hi>praecordia,</hi> it becomes ſmall and obſcure, ſo as to indicate greater weakneſs than there really is: on the other hand, when drowſy lethargic ſymptoms come on, it often reſembles that of a perſon in full health, though the ſick is in the utmoſt danger. The urine, whether made in the time of the paroxiſm or interval, is always clear, frothy, and of a deep red co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, without any ſeparation. Blood drawn from a vein is moſt commonly florid like ſcarlet, without any ſizey cruſt: the <hi>ſerum</hi> is ſometimes tinged with yellow, but oftner red like the <hi>lotura carnium,</hi> and in great quantity. Sometimes the <hi>ſerum</hi> and <hi>craſſamentum</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main united in a lax gelatinous maſs.</p>
               <p>As the fever advances to its height, the coldneſs and ſhivering which uſher in the paroxiſms become leſs, or intirely imperceptible: in which caſe a <hi>cholera mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi> or acute pains in the back or limbs, often ſupply their place: frequently the ſhiverings are intermixed with fluſhings of heat. In the mean time, the parox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſms themſelves become longer, and bring on more formidable ſymptoms; ſuch as head-achs, raving, <hi>ſopors,</hi>
                  <pb n="113" facs="unknown:033590_0116_0FF794D29D3DE6A0"/>
apoplectic fits, bleeding at the noſe, cough, difficulty of breathing, palpitation of the heart, irregularity of the pulſe, ſickneſs and anxiety, pain about the upper orifice of the ſtomach, vomiting and purging; heat, tenſion, pain and pulſation in the abdominal <hi>viſcera; ſubſultus tendinum,</hi> and an infinite variety of other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, which do not entirely ceaſe with the ſweat, that carries off the paroxiſm; ſo that the apyrexy is not only ſhortened, but rendered more obſcure.</p>
               <p>Beſides, it often happens, during the ſecond, third, fourth, or fifth period, that the tertian becomes double, though at firſt it was ſimple: Or if it was double from the beginning, the weaker fit continues, without any intermiſſion, till the ſtronger comes on, and both being blended together, the diſeaſe puts on the appearance of a ſemitertian, having one very long fit, with a ſhort interval every forty-eight hours. Sometimes a double tertian degenerates into a triple tertian, two fits inſtead of one happening on the odd days.</p>
               <p>It muſt likewiſe be obſerved, that, in the progreſs of the fever, the regular order of the periods is frequently diſturbed, by the paroxiſms changing their hour of invaſion, and attacking, unawares without any previous cold. Nor are anticipating fits always a bad ſign, or thoſe which poſtpone a good one, as ſome authors in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate; on the contrary, the firſt frequently ſhew the ſtrength of nature, as the others do her weakneſs.</p>
               <p>After this manner theſe proteform diſtempers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to vary their ſhape in every period, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce longer, more fevere, or more frequent paroxiſms, till they arrive at their height; about which time the fits and intervals are often ſo confuſed, that they are ſcarcely to be diſtinguiſhed: nevertheleſs, if death be not ſpeedily the conſequence of this confuſion, they commonly again put on a more ſimple or regular form, and, after one or more ſlight paroxiſms, go away of their own accord.</p>
               <p>Thoſe fevers which come to their height in the third period, terminate in the fourth or fifth period. Thoſe which come to their height in the fourth period, terminate in the fifth or ſixth. And thoſe which come
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:033590_0117_0FF794D51E3BD670"/>
to their height in the fifth, terminate in the ſixth or ſeventh. When the moſt vehement paroxiſms happen on the odd days, the <hi>criſes</hi> will be on the odd days: When they happen on the even days, the great changes of the diſtemper will likewiſe be on the even days.</p>
               <p>If the fever increaſes to the ſeventh period, it proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly will not ceaſe before the ninth: But it rarely hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens that intermitting or remitting tertians run out to ſo great a length. Yet I have ſeen every year a few of the continual kind, which began with great mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and increaſing by ſlow degrees, broke out vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently in the third or fourth week; and ſoon after ended in intermittents; though ſome of them have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued without any conſiderable interval, for ſix or ſeven weeks.</p>
               <p>In the cure of tertians, the ſymptoms of the parox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſms are more to be regarded than the types of the periods; for <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> ſimple, double, triple, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termittent, and remittent tertians, together with the ſemitertians, all require the ſame ſort of treatment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>With regard to bleeding</hi> it has been warmly debated among both antient and modern authors where it ought or ought not to be uſed in tertian fevers. Much has been wrote on both ſides; but the queſtion appears to me too general to admit of a poſitive anſwer. CELSUS<note n="*" place="bottom">De Med. Praefat.</note> has juſtly obſerved that <q>medicines differ, according to the nature of the climate; one kind being neceſſary in <hi>Rome,</hi> another in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and a third in <hi>France.</hi>
                  </q> And ſince we daily meet with a remarkable diverſity of ſymptoms among fevers of the tertian tribe even in the ſame climate at the ſame ſeaſon of the year, it cannot ſurely be ſurprizing that any one remedy is not equally beneficial in all caſes, and at all times.</p>
               <p>For my own part, when I was called early enough, in the beginning of theſe fevers I uſed to take away ſome blood (unleſs there was a ſtrong contraindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) from people of all ages; namely, from robuſt
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:033590_0118_0FF794D88A6ABB98"/>
adults ten or twelve ounces; from others a ſmaller quantity in proportion to their ſtrength and years. And farther, if a violent head-ach, and obſtinate <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium,</hi> and great heat or pains of the bowels were urgent, within a day or two, I repeated the bleeding. By which ſeaſonable evacuation the vehemency of the paroxiſms is ſomewhat diminiſhed; the apyrexies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more compleat; the operation of emetics and cathartics is rendered ſafer and more ſucceſsful; and the terrible ſymptoms, which often make their appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance about the height of the diſtemper, ſuch as raving <hi>ſopor,</hi> difficulty of breathing, inflammations of the <hi>abdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, viſcera, &amp;c.</hi> are either prevented or mitigated.</p>
               <p>But if before I was called, the fever had already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſome time, and the maſs of blood appeared to be too much melted down, or inclinable to a putrid diſſolution, which is often the caſe, during the extreme hot weather, about the fourth period of the diſtemper, and is readily known by the great alteration of the patient's looks and his ſudden loſs of ſtrength; or if the firſt paroxiſms of the diſeaſe were attended with profuſe evacuations, whether by vomiting, purging, ſweating, or a haemorrhage from the noſe: In all theſe circumſtances, I either omitted the bleeding entirely, or took away a very ſmall quantity, though ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate ſymptoms might ſeem to require a much larger evacuation.</p>
               <p>But when bleeding is allowed to be neceſſary, it is aſked at what particular time of the periodical revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it ought to be performed? The ancients<note n="*" place="bottom">Si vehemens febris urget, in ipſo impetu ejus, ſanguinem mittere hominem jugulare eſt, expectanda ergo intermiſſio, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> CEL. l. ii. c. x.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that <q>to open a vein in the height of the fever, was to deſtroy the patient;</q> and therefore they order you to wait for the intermiſſion, or the hour on which the ſymptoms are generally moſt moderate. But the experience of the preſent age has taught us that this operation is ſafe enough, at any time of the
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:033590_0119_0FF794DA1AE34148"/>
period, unleſs while the cold fit laſts, or is ſoon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; or while the ſkin is covered with critical ſweats. Of late years, encouraged by the example of ſome practitioners of reputation<note n="*" place="bottom">Aſtruc on Fevers, p. 71. Gourraigne de Febribus.</note>, I commonly opened a vein in the beginning of the hot fit; by which means the ſick were immediately relieved; the immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate heat of the body (which is often productive of fatal effects) was diminiſhed; and the critical ſweats were brought on ſooner, and in greater abundance. But when that time of the paroxiſm was paſſed before my being called, I bled in the evening, when it abated or went off, that I might be at liberty next day to make uſe of the remiſſion or intermiſſion, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly happens in the morning, to evacuate the firſt paſſages.</p>
               <p>When I firſt became acquainted with theſe diſeaſes, the uncommon violence of their ſymptoms induced me to lay the principal ſtreſs of the cure on evacuations; and to have recourſe to frequent bleeding upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the inflammations of the <hi>viſcera;</hi> endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the ſame time by repeated cathartics to diſcharge the corrupted humours from the inteſtines: but when experience had convinced me that the bark was both a ſafe and effectual remedy in theſe circumſtances, I then plainly perceived that ſuch profuſe evacuations were unneceſſary if not prejudicial; and of late years, as I ſeldom omitted to bleed and purge once or twice, I rarely repeated either operation oftener.</p>
               <p>In ſemitertians and remittents, which approach to the nature of continual fevers, I give a cathartic early in the morning of that day on which the ſymptoms are moſt moderate; haſtening the operation with glyſters (if occaſion requires) ſo that it may be finiſhed before the middle of the day, about which time the patient commonly grows worſe. In true ſimple and double tertians there is generally an interval every morning, in which the purgative may be adminiſtered, but that
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:033590_0120_0FF794DBCBD1E4E8"/>
which ſucceeds the worſt fit, is the moſt proper, as it is more calm, and continues longer than the other.</p>
               <p>Proper evacuations being premiſed, if poſſible, within the firſt four or five days of the diſtemper, I carefully examine the condition of the patient, during the third revolution, and determine accordingly in what manner it will be neceſſary to proceed. If the paroxiſms of that revolution be neither longer, nor attended with more threatening ſymptoms, than thoſe of the ſecond: if the patient preſerves his ſtrength, bears his illneſs eaſily, and ſigns of concoction appear in the urine, I frequently truſt the whole buſineſs to nature, which commonly terminates the fever about the fourth or fifth revolution, and, for the moſt part, with an increaſe of ſome of the natural evacuations; ſo that ſweats, cloudy or thick urine, and bilious ſtools often ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene, and ſometimes a ſpontaneous efflux of ſpittle, or a copious expectoration of pituitous matter.</p>
               <p>But if the paroxiſm on the fifth day be evidently the longeſt and moſt fevere that has happened; if it be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with any doubtful or dangerous ſymptoms; if the ſick become giddy, feeble, and languid; in theſe caſes, without delay, I have recourſe to the bark; and the ſame evening, as ſoon as the ſweats have procured a remiſſion, I order two ſcruples or a drachm of it in powder to be given every two or three hours, or every hour and a half, ſo that five or ſix drachms may be taken before next day at noon, with as little interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their ſleep as may be; and the aſſiſtants are ſtrictly enjoined to comply punctually with theſe direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, leſt if this interval eſcape, we ſhould not after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards have a favourable opportunity of giving a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient quantity of the medicine, as the fits about this period of the diſeaſe are wont to become double, ſub-intrant, or continual. Yet it is not always in our power to put an immediate ſtop to the fever by this means: On the contrary, do what we can, it will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten proceed in its career, and, in ſpite of all our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, run obſtinately on to the ſeventh or ninth day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But the great advantage which accrues from the early
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:033590_0121_0FF794DE495000B0"/>
uſe of the bark, is, that it invigorates the powers of the body, it prevents or removes the dangerous ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, and in tertians, which of their own accord would continue to the end of the ſecond week or longer, it brings on a criſis ſooner, and with much leſs diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance. In ſhort, to uſe the expreſſion of one of the greateſt promoters of medical knowledge in this age<note n="*" place="bottom">MONRO on the Uſe of the Bark in Small Pox and Gargrenes, Med.

For ſo far is it from ſuppreſſing any beneficial diſcharge, as ſome have aſſerted, that we daily obſerve a laudable ſeparation in the urine, warm, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe, univerſal ſweats, plentiful bilious ſtools, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the haemorrhoids and menſes coming on after it has been uſed; though it effectually reſtrains the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquative night ſweats, to which perſons weakened by tedious intermittents are incident.</p>
               <p>DR. HUXHAM in his Eſſay on Fevers, remarks that "Sometimes quotidian, ſemi-tertian and tertian fevers, are very rife and cotemporary with epidemic pleuriſies, and peripneumonies; as particularly in<note n="†" place="bottom">Vid.

intermittent.—Thus we often ſee perſons of low ſpirits, and a leucophlegmetic habit of body, raiſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a feveriſh diſpoſition by the uſe of warm invigorating medicines, chalybeates, &amp;c. And if this turn of nature, be well managed, it generally ends in their perfect recovery. If you can change a ſlow nervous fever into a regular intermittent, you ſoon cure your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient.</p>
               <p>"It is commonly noted, that if the fever, from a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular tertian, runs into a ſemi-tertian, or quotidian, or greatly anticipates the time of the regular paroxiſm; a remittent, or continual fever is forthwith the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.—And this is too often effected by a very hot regimen, or a too haſty uſe of the bark. Indeed we very frequently ſee that quotidians, and double tertians, (which, by the bye, are oftentimes the ſame thing) will not bear the bark, at the beginning; till the ſaline draughts, proper diluting attenuants, and in ſome caſes, bleeding, purging, and vomiting have been made uſe of. In truth, I never think it prudent, in ſuch kinds of intermittents, to give the bark, in any form, till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter four or five paroxiſms at leaſt, and after having drawn more or leſs blood from perſons pretty much inclined to the plethoric; and this method is more eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to be obſerved in vernal agues.</p>
               <p>If an intermittent runs into an inflammatory con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual fever, bleeding and a gentle cool purge will ſoon reduce it to its type.</p>
               <p>But as ſome intermittents are apt to run up into an inflammatory fever, far the greater number, eſpecially in the autumnal ſeaſon, are diſpoſed to ſink into low irregular remittents, putrid or ſlow nervous fevers. It is not a very rare thing to find a quotidian fall into a tertian, thence into a quartan, and at laſt end in a dropſy; and this particularly in ſome ſeaſons and places. This evidently ſhews that the fibres grow more and more enervated and the blood very vapid and watery. Even vernal tertians, which oftentimes cure themſelves in a favourable ſeaſon, prove many times exceeding obſtinate in wet, rainy ſummers, and the patients are exceeding apt to relapſe on the ſlighteſt occaſions: This
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:033590_0123_0FF794E33980BFB8"/>
was particularly obſervable in the wet, cold ſummers of 1734 and 1735.<note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. Obſ. noſtr. de Aere &amp; Morbis Epidemic. Vol. I.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Perhaps it is the winter-cold, bracing up the fibres, that commonly puts a ſtop to agues in that ſeaſon; for it hath been noted, that they are often very ſtubborn in a warm moiſt winter.</p>
               <p>Improper evacuations by bleeding and purging, an unwholeſome, groſs glutinous diet, vapid ropy drinks, as ſtagnant heavy water, foul beer, and the like, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe agues very anomalous, obſtinate and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and make them frequently degenerate into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant, putrid, or ſlow nervous fevers; otherwiſe they end in dropſies, jaundice, or univerſal obſtructions of the viſcera of the abdomen, and frequently in diſeaſes of the genus nervoſum. In a word whatever takes down the ſpring of the fibres too much, and weakens the craſis of the blood, will be productive of theſe miſchiefs; and this eſpecially, when due perſpiration is frequently interrupted by cold damp air, want of due exerciſe, groſs heavy ſlimy diet, as fiſh, lettuce, cucum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and other watery inſipid fruits, which are known to ſuppreſs the perſpiration greatly.</p>
               <p>Theſe obſervations then evidently ſhew the neceſſity of uſing a warm, invigorating, attenuating regimen in the cure of agues, which affect perſons of a lax ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of body, and a poor thin blood; in a particular manner when a wet, foggy atmoſphere prevails. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch circumſtances the cortex of Peru, however good and carefully choſen, frequently proves ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, unleſs aſſiſted with proper alexipharmacs, as rad. ſerpentar. virgin. Contrayerv. myrrh, camphire, &amp;c. After four or five paroxiſms, warm chalybeates may be added with very great ſucceſs. But never be too haſty in giving the bark, or chalybeates, where the patient hath a yellow caſt of the countenance, a tenſe abdomen, and a very coſtive habit of body. In which caſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial, ſaponaceous deobſtruents with rhubarb, aloetics,
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:033590_0124_0FF794E4E8DCFFA0"/>
regenerate or ſoluble tartar, ſhould be premiſed; nay they may in ſome caſes be very conveniently joined with the bark.</p>
               <p>THE eminent Morgagni, Preſident of the Univerſity at Padua, remarks that "In malignant and epidemical fevers, it is not of ſo much importance to counteract the fever, as it is to counteract that malignant quality which is joined thereto; and which is, to the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the difficulty in ſuch a counteraction, almoſt peculiar in every conſtitution.</p>
               <p>And certainly, unleſs you endeavour to overcome this malignant quality for the moſt part; you do the ſame thing, as if you ſhould endeavour to overcome a fever, which had its origin from the bite of a viper, by antife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brile remedies; without paying any regard to the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon infuſed; to make uſe of the ſame example, which I perceive, from the hiſtory of the royal academy of ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at Paris<note n="*" place="bottom">A. 1753.</note>, the celebrated Du Queſnay has made uſe of alſo.</p>
               <p>For which reaſon, we ought the more to give thanks to the providence of Almighty God, that, in ſo very great an obſcurity, and variety, of caſes, it has favoured us with a remedy, the powers of which, in overcoming ſome dangerous fevers at leaſt, is proved by experience; though the method in which it acts is ſomewhat ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure; I mean the Peruvian bark.</p>
               <p>For this remedy, although ſome of theſe fevers ſeem to have one kind of malignity joined with them, and ſome another; as appears from the external cauſes and ſymptoms; can nevertheleſs counteract the one and the other equally; and ſubdue their malignity; as I have learned both from my own obſervations, and thoſe of others.</p>
               <p>Nor was the matter which has begun to be thrown out of the blood, either upon the ſkin, or about the

joints, by any means repugnant to the ſalubrious effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the bark; not even when repelled inwards, from thence, by the force of the external cold.</p>
               <p>For a very eminent cardinal was cured by the bark of a malignant fever, into which he had fallen, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of ſuch a repulſion; as I have written to you on a former occaſion:<note n="*" place="bottom">Epiſt. 49. n. 80. &amp; ſeqq.</note> And that very famous man Haller was alſo cured thereby of a very violent fever, which had come upon him in conſequence of a gout being thus repelled; and which was attended with an eryſipelas of the face likewiſe: and this he relates in the remarks that he has made upon the hundred and fifty-ſecond diſputation, among thoſe which he has col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and publiſhed, as "contributing to the hiſtory and cure of diſeaſes."</p>
               <p>For it is paſt a doubt, that theſe things are not ſo much to be attended to, as this which I then ſpoke of; I mean, whether the fevers are periodical: that is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are wont to have an intermiſſion, or a remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion at leaſt; ſo as to afford us room to hope, that, by a timely and proper uſe of the bark, both the fevers themſelves, and their attendant malignity, will be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.</p>
               <p>Nor does the bark only overcome what is febrile; but even that which is not febrile; ſo that it does but recur periodically: although this effect is not ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, when the diſorder is without any manifeſt fever: and as we have already ſaid, that this has been obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo we might now alſo confirm it by a more recent, and more clear obſervation of Stephanus Weſzpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus; I mean, of an equally ſevere, and obſtinate, he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micrania being overcome by the ſame remedy, after having been already exacerbated every fourth hour, for two weeks together; and not having remitted till after two hours.</p>
               <p>And if this obſervation, which was made and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in the year 1756, could have exiſted fifty years before; when I at length with difficulty put to flight
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:033590_0126_0FF794EB020B8F40"/>
that very ſevere hemicrania, which returned every day at the ſame hour, by the preſcription of a number of different remedies; I ſhould certainly have made uſe of none more readily, and perhaps more ſucceſsfully than this; notwithſtanding I had been ignorant of the mode in which it produces its effects.</p>
               <p>And I could wiſh the malignant and epidemical fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, whereof we had begun to ſpeak, were all perio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical, as they are almoſt all of them joined with a various and obſcure force of malignity; we ſhould then have in this cortex a medicine, which, although we might be ignorant in what manner it operates, we might nevertheleſs try with a reaſonable hope of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</p>
               <p>But they are very often ſynochae, or continual fevers; and ſuch as, if you diſſect the bodies of thoſe who have been carried off by them, either ſhow nothing, as I have ſaid in the beginning, which diſcovers the peculiar nature, and ſituation, of the principal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe; or ſhow conſiderable and evident injuries of the viſcera indeed, but ſuch as, if you compare them with thoſe ſymptoms that have been obſerved in the patients while living, you will naturally conceive to have been produced by ſome other latent and principal diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>That is to ſay, by way of example, an inflammatory fever of the viſcera, after diſſection, ſhows the viſcera to have been inflamed, whether it is benign, or malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; but in the living patient if it he benign, it is alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated by repeated blood-lettings: If malignant, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes worſe, and is very ſoon fatal.</p>
               <p>The cauſe of the difference is another principal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe being joined to it; as in that fever at Roan de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by the celebrated Malouin, which, about the end of the year 1753, carried off a great number, in a very ſhort time, in that place.</p>
               <p>For by reaſon of the malignant acrimony of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which irritated the ſtomach and inteſtines, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation was at length produced, which was found in thoſe viſcera, and was already degenerated into a gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene: the other internal parts being unhurt, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly

thoſe of the head; which otherwiſe had been troubled with a pain, that aroſe from a conſent of parts, and increaſed every day ſo as to bring on a delirium.</p>
               <p>The college of phyſicians at Roan, therefore, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently and uſefully determined, that the inflammation was not then to be attended to; as it either did not exiſt in the beginning, or aroſe accidentally in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the diſeaſe: but that every method muſt be taken to eliminate that very acrid matter from the firſt paſſages; for from this, if it were left within, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent irritation is much more to be feared, than a tranſient one from purgative remedies, eſpecially when they are of a milder kind."</p>

                  <p>"TO the violent heats in ſummer 1754 ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a hot autumn; in the beginning of winter, we had either perpetual ſhowers or fogs, and the ſeaſon warm. The weather remained thus till the third day of the following year, when there ſuddenly came on that violent cold, which by the 5th and 6th of January grew ſo intenſe over all Europe almoſt, that it fell but little ſhort of that remarkable and ſince unparalleled froſt of the year 1709. It continued very ſevere to the 14th of the month, then it abated ſomewhat, though the ſame froſt ſtill laſted till the 20th of February. March was ſhowery; April hot, which is very uncommon in our country, that happening at that time to attend pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients in the ſmall-pox, I was obliged to renew the air
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:033590_0128_0FF794EE439BA908"/>
in the chambers from all quarters, and moiſten the boards frequently with cold water. In the beginning of May, the ſevere cold returned with a northerly wind, and was very pernicious to the tender leaves and bloſſoms. The weather was unſettled during the whole month. Violent heat commenced with the month of June, and continued to the 23d of July.</p>
                  <p>The diſeaſe was not equally violent in all. With regard to its vehemence, it may be accurately enough divided into three claſſes. The firſt was attended with no danger, unleſs by being neglected it degenerated into a chronic diſtemper. The ſecond, though not void of danger, yet as far as I know never proved mortal, except when either by wrong management, or no care at all, it was changed into the third. The third claſs was very rare, but always very threatening, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fatal.</p>

                  <head>The Hiſtory of the Diſeaſe.</head>
                  <p>Patients of the firſt claſs complained firſt of a laſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, weakneſs, weight particularly of the head, loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of food, an uneaſy and almoſt conſtant ſenſation of cold, inſomuch that during the dog-days they would go with great pleaſure to a kitchen fire; they were drowſy without ſleeping; their mouth ſlimy; and their tongue foul with a whitiſh-yellow tenacious covering. After three or four days, ſometimes later, a ſhivering came on towards evening, which harraſſed them for an hour or two, ſometimes longer: this was followed by a heat not vehement indeed, but troubleſome and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, which communicated a ſmart heat to the fingers of the phyſician; in ſome this continued till morning, and then gradually went off without any ſenſible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion; in others after ſome hours a gentle ſweat came on, for I never ſaw it profuſe, but it did not bring that placid interval, which ſucceeds the ſweats of true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termittents. I heard frequent complaints of the head in the time of the paroxiſm, but none of the cheſt. In the firſt days the pulſe hardly differed from a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral one, except by its weakneſs; in the time of the ſhivering it was very ſmall, during the heat quick, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted,
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:033590_0129_0FF794F1A0BF06B0"/>
and frequent, yet not exceeding an hundred pulſations in a minute in an adult woman. When the paroxiſm was ended, the patients remained in the ſame ſtate of langour, which I deſcribed before, riſing indeed out of bed, but unfit for all kinds of employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, torpid, lazy, dragging themſelves from their chair to the bed, and from the bed to the chair, and not walking without reluctance. The paroxiſm re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned every day, but frequently varied from its firſt hour; neither was it always ſimilar to itſelf in other circumſtances. Nay, there were ſome patients, who without regard to any period, ſhivered and grew hot often in one day; I knew ſeveral in whom I could hardly ſuſpect any exacerbation, unleſs from a little more anxiety and debility in the evening, but they were never free from the oppreſſion of the langour, nor were they ſooner cured than others. There were ſome, particularly of the older women, who ſcarcely complained of any thing elſe beſide debility, loathing of food, and want of ſleep. Some were diſtreſſed with a pain of their ſtomach; and what was common to them all, they did not recover till after ſome weeks. There were ſeveral patients whom, no ſuch violent ſymptoms appearing as required the ſpeedy aid of a phyſician, I did not ſee till fifteen days after they had been ſeized, and I found little or no difference in their ſymptoms from the others, ſave that the heat and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility had increaſed, and by that time brought them in danger of a ſlow fever. In the beginning of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper, the belly was bound, towards the end a little more lax; the urine during the interval was thin and crude, in the violence of the paroxiſm a little more red; upon the decline of the diſeaſe it became con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted with a ſediment. I found very few who had much thirſt. Boys, women, and old people were prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally ſubject to this ſpecies, men very rarely. Old men eſcaped the ſecond. The third attacked only young men in the flower of life, from 15 to 40, and generally carried off the more robuſt.</p>
                  <p>The beginning of the ſecond claſs was not very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from that of the firſt; but after ſome days every
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:033590_0130_0FF794F42767BCF0"/>
thing was more aggravated, the weakneſs increaſed, a nauſea followed the loathing of food, but the ſick very rarely vomited ſpontaneouſly; the heat was more briſk, and the paroxiſms more violent; at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning they did ſhiver, though gently, but afterwards ſcarce any coldneſs was perceived before the parox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſms; but the heat grew gradually more intenſe, <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in the evening;</hi> the pulſe was more frequent, and upon trial, in ſome perſons I was able to count one hundred and ſixteen ſtrokes in a minute. At this time ſeveral were diſtreſſed with moſt acute head-achs. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter three, four, or five hours the fever remitted, and, as in the firſt ſpecies, without a ſweat. Nor were ſweats very deſireable, for upon the decline of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper they did good, but during its height, both in this, and in the third ſpecies they were prejudicial; for the more profuſe they were, the more ſevere was the ſucceeding paroxiſm. The patient had not a perfect interval, and this was the pathognomic ſymptom, whereby we might diſtinguiſh the ſecond ſpecies from the firſt. The urine was ſmall in quantity, thin, and reddiſh; the natural ſtools few and ſmall, the tongue dry, and covered with a yellow mucus; they had ſcarce any ſleep, but what was turbulent, with anxiety, and not at all refreſhing; the thirſt was more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome than in the firſt ſpecies, and yet not ſo great as might have been expected from the heat; the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient was quickly <hi>emaciated with a pale yellow face.</hi> The paroxiſms were not ſo irregular as in the firſt ſpecies. By bad management the tranſition was eaſy from the ſecond to the third claſs or degree.</p>
                  <p>The third claſs or degree, appeared to be a diſtinct diſtemper by itſelf; for in ſeveral, although they made uſe of the beſt remedies from the firſt attack of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, and their diſorder ſeemed to be reſtrained by them, yet on the ſixth, ſeventh, or eighth day, all the more alarming ſymptoms came on. When I had left a perſon in the evening with the hopes of a milder pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxiſm, I often found him next morning dangerouſly ill after a ſevere night, with a frequent and very quick pulſe, <hi>a beginning delirium, and a flatulent ſwelling of the

abdomen, which two ſymptoms diſtinguiſhed the third claſs from the ſecond;</hi> then the paroxiſms ſcarcely any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger preſerved the leaſt order in their attacks, but came on irregularly at all times; the pulſe became ſo frequent, that the ſtrokes could hardly be counted; there was a general ſubſultus of the tendons; the anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iety and reſtleſsneſs were without intermiſſion, the eyes fierce, twinkling and gummy: the delirium increaſing, made ſome briſk, and approached almoſt to a phrenzy, in others it was more calm, and reſembled a lethargy, in both caſes it was dangerous: The firſt talked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly, the others were ſilent and moroſe, and made not the leaſt complaint of the diſtemper, though by holding their hand frequently to their forehead, it was plain they had a violent head-ach. When the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician aſked how they did, they looked ſtedfaſtly at him and anſwered in a briſk tone of voice, <hi>Very well.</hi> They did not know their friends, the flatulent ſwelling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed daily, eſpecially about the hypochondria. The breath grew ſhort, ſo that they almoſt conſtantly panted; a cough was an uncommon ſymptom; their ſtools were irregular, liquid, fat, colliquative, and <hi>ſometimes bilious, which was good;</hi> often white and frothy, which was always a very bad ſign, for it implied the retention of the morbid matter, and a ſpaſmodic diſorder in the motions of the inteſtines. Some few however were ſeized with a purging at the beginning; nor did things go better with them: Nay, I ſaw a young woman in this diſtemper, which proved fatal, who, as I was told, had been afflicted with a ſerous diſcharge by ſtool for two months before the diſeaſe. In general a purging, which came on at the beginning, was hurtful, for it was always ſymptomatic; and although it was very fetid, yet it left the cauſe of the diſeaſe untouched; ſo that with the increaſe of theſe evacuations, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe grew worſe, to the aſtoniſhment of the by-ſtanders. The urine was always crude; in other reſpects differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent every day, white, thin, oily, turbid, reſembling that of cattle, red and colliquative; if there was any cloud it always occupied the upper part, which Hippocrates condemns. From paralytic ſpincters and the delirium,
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:033590_0132_0FF794F8213F8150"/>
the evacuations were involuntary and unperceived by them. In five I met with purple ſpots, to all whom they were mortal<note n="*" place="bottom">When any purple or livid puſtules appear on the ſkin, the by pochondria being tenſe and inſtated, the patient generally dies. HOERHAV. Aphor. 735.</note>; there were either no hemorrhages at all, or they were fatal, no thirſt, though the tongue was dry, black, and tremulous; the voice was ſhrill, and there was an univerſal tremor, a gathering of the clothes, and catching at flies. After the greateſt reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs, came on the higheſt debility, which was follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by death. Sometimes, when the diſtemper was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed in the beginning by the mildeſt ſymptoms, I was led to ſuſpect ſome lurking miſchief from the <hi>ſmall and quick pulſe, a very gentle, but univerſal tremor, a ſudden change of the countenance, and a certain kind of anxiety and moroſeneſs, quite oppoſite to the mildneſs of the ſymptoms.</hi> I remember a man addicted to drinking, upon whom the diſtemper gained ground ſo faſt, that he appeared even on the third day to be beyond hope, with a very bad pulſe, a ſhortneſs of breath to the higheſt degree, and a delirium; he was relieved in a ſhort time by a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. In this, as well as the other ſpecies, the paroxiſms with regard to their vehemence, followed the form of a tertian, ſo that I have always obſerved the ſymptoms more aggravated every other day, and they died on the worſt day, from the ſeventeenth to the twenty-fifth day. I know of only two perſons who died after the thirty-fifth.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the principal and pathognomic ſymptoms of our epidemic diſtemper: Some varieties and more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable caſes I leave till afterwards, to avoid repetition. The greateſt violence of it continued from the beginning of June, to the end of October; during which time, it became ſo epidemic, that hardly one in four of any family eſcaped it; and in ſeveral houſes, two, three, nay ſix, were ill of it at one time. Several were alſo ſeized with it in the following winter, which being rainy and warm, favoured epidemic diſeaſes; ſome ſevere in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances

                  <head>Method of Cure.</head>
                  <p>At firſt for ſome time, I uſed ipecacuan, but I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently found that this celebrated root had not in this caſe ſufficient force; it had beſides this bad property, that after the evacuation was over, it left the patient coſtive and ſometimes thirſty; I was therefore glad to change it for the emetic tartar, which I hardly ever dropped after that: the doſe, being proportioned to the age and other indications, was diſſolved in eight or ten ounces of water, with an addition of a ſixth part of ſyrup of capillaire. I directed the whole to be drank at two, three, or four draughts; and this method of dividing the potion ſucceeded happily in ſo great a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of ſick people as I attended, the generality of whoſe particular conſtitutions, I was till then entirely unacquainted with. There was another advantage at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending this medicine, that being palatable it was not in the leaſt nauſeous, even to children and more deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate people. I ſometimes made an addition of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, though the ſolution of tartar alone ſeldom failed to procure ſtools, which I always reckoned of great importance; for beſides, that in this way the much larger quantity of morbid matter is evacuated, it is the method nature points out for diſcharding the relics of the morbid matter. The effect of the remedy was, that generally in little more than half an hour; that is, ſome time after the ſecond draught, there was an inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to retch, which was followed by vomiting; and if the quantity of the diſcharge was judged ſufficient, the remainder of the potion was not uſed; if not, it was drank; the vomiting brought up viſcous matter mixed with yellow, bitter bile; then followed ſtools or liquid, yellow, fetid excrements. I often encouraged the vomiting, by plentiful draughts of hydromel; when it ceaſed, I promoted copious ſtools by giving at a ſpoonful each time what remained of the potion diluted in a large vehicle. Thus after the evacuation was
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:033590_0134_0FF794FE268F6DF0"/>
over, the patient found himſelf better, with regard to his anxiety, debility, and ſleep. The ſame method was followed by that celebrated practitioner, Walca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renghi, and has been recommended to poſterity by G. E. Stahl, <hi>for the method of cure, adequate to the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of the peccant matter in theſe fevers, can be no other than vomiting and purging</hi>

                  <p>After the firſt evacuation refrigerating laxative re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies were preſcribed; and I never failed to obſerve, that thoſe medicines, which before had hardly proved cathartic, having their force increaſed by the diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the morbid excrements, produced at this time two or three ſtools every day, always of a putrid na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The langour was gradually diminiſhed, and alſo the length of the paroxiſm. After three or four days, if a plentiful diſcharge of urine afforded the ſigns of a concoction, we had recourſe to purging by ſalts, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, tamarinds, and now and then a ſmall doſe of ſenna. Sometimes when there was reaſon to expect that ſtools would be eaſily procured, it ſufficed to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve two ounces of manna with ſome ſalt in their common drink in the morning; and a coipious diſcharge of excrements followed, from that, there ſcarcely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained the form of a paroxiſm; the ſkin grew ſoft, their ſleep became compoſed; they no longer loathed their food, though they had not yet any deſire for it. The natural heat was more ſlowly reſtored, and they were almoſt always cold. Then they took only a doſe or two of their medicines every day; all the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms went off gradually, the bilious ſtools which were ſo ſalutary ſtill continued, and both evacuated the morbid matter, and ſhewed that the viſcera recovered their tone; for it was with us, as the famous Galla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotti obſerved it to be at Cremona, <hi>we could ſafely hope for a complete termination of the fever, only while the ſtools continued bilious.</hi> And indeed if we fell ſhort of this happy appearance, I was obliged both to give the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frigerents longer, and in a larger doſe, and to repeat the cathartic a third time, nay ſometimes, but very
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:033590_0135_0FF794FFB654F750"/>
rarely, a fourth time. I do not remember an inſtance of a fifth purging being uſed. In lax conſtitutions, which laboured more under a viſcoſity than acrimony, I ſometimes avoided aqueous liquors after the firſt purging, and ordered a potion compoſed of a large doſe of tartar. regenerat. a ſmall quantity of elixir pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietat. with the diſtilled waters of ſuccory and citron-peel, and compound ſyrup of ſuccory, adding oxy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel, when the circumſtances required it.</p>
                  <p>They who refuſed medicines, and after the firſt vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit laid aſide all remedies unleſs perhaps toaſt and water or lemonade, of whom there were many, having the morbid matter leſſened by means of the diet, which their loathing directed them to, gradually got the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the fever indeed, but they recovered their health ſlowly, and imperfectly, and ſeveral of them were obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged after ſome months to have recourſe to medicines.</p>
                  <p>If it was dangerous to give over evacuations too ſoon, it was alſo dangerous to continue them too long; and a man would be miſerably deceived, if he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined they were to be perſiſted in, till the appetite and ſtrength were entirely reſtored. The inappetency and debility aroſe in the beginning of the diſtemper from the cacochymy oppreſſing the ſtomach and primae viae; and now at the end of the diſeaſe they were owing to a laxity of the fibres, the languor of the ſecretions, and a defect of good juices in the body. We muſt therefore here attend to the caution of Boerhaave, <hi>what does good at one time, may yet be hurtful, if given at another, though in the ſame diſtemper,</hi> and we had a ſad proof of this by experience. For while ſome continued opening medicines with a view of diſcharging the the morbid matter, which they blamed for theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, I have ſeen the diſeaſe protracted, the debility increaſed, and the exceſſive irritation of the gaſtric and inteſtinal nerves followed by the whole train of irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular ſpaſmodic ſymptoms. Theſe I never obſerved, if the cathartics were diſmiſſed in proper time, and a ſuitable diet with exerciſe in the country, and ſome ſtrengthening medicines were made uſe of.

                  <p>Being called in the middle of the night to viſit a gentleman with a biliary ardent fever, I preſcribed a clyſter, and a draught of barley-water, which was at hand, with ſome drops of Hoffman's anodyne mineral liquor, which after agitations of mind, I have found an excellent remedy by drinking ſome tepid liqour after it. The ſymptoms abated, and in the morning I could ſafely give manna, tamarinds, and a ſmall doſe of eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic tartar, diſſolved in a decoction of graſs, of which he was to take three ounces every hour, and after this doſe was finiſhed, the ſame decoction of graſs with juice of ſorrel and citron. Returning in the evening, for the patient lived in the country, I found he had drank ſcarce half the pur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In the morning I preſcribed the ſame laxative ptiſan, and another of barley water, an acid ſyrup, and ſpirit of nitre, and ſtrong ſinapiſms to the ſoles of his feet. I took my leave, and every thing was ſet aſide, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulation is talked of, which met in the afternoon; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the fore-mentioned drinks, milk-whey with tamarinds is preſcribed, inſtead of the ſinapiſms, bliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the legs; next day every thing grew worſe, no evacuations followed; the day after there was another conſultation at ſix in the morning; he laboured under the greateſt reſtleſſneſs, and a ſtrong phrenitic dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium, his pulſe as before, frequent, ſmall, and quick, which was very bad, <hi>for phrenſies with a ſtrong tenſe and ſlow pulſe are curable, hardly with a ſmall and quick one.</hi> Upon account of the delirium he is bled, which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated againſt in vain, he grows more outrageous, and his hypocondres become tenſe. Three hours after by the advice of the other phyſician, he is again bled in the foot, ſtill againſt my judgment; the patient

faints, and the delirium abated a little from his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for it returned again with his ſtrength; ſeveral doſes of an emetic medicine are given, but hardly any evacuation followed, he had a very bad night. Next day the reſult of the fourth conſultation was, giving a ſtrong cathartic; his pulſe was hardly perceptible, with a ſtrong delirium: he had no ſtool; in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon a ſharp clyſter is injected, and there followed an immenſe diſcharge; and by continued faintings an end was put to the life of this worthy man. I leave it to the judgment of phyſicians, whether the former method was preferable to the latter. Death certainly could not follow with more cruel ſymptoms, nor more rapidly; all indications with regard to the ſtrength were neglected, nor were any other remedies adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, but ſuch whoſe futility I have demonſtrated. Would the cold bath have done any ſervice in this caſe? The antients undoubtedly thought ſo, <hi>for in a continued putrid fever, if the patient was not emaciated, and was young, the temper of the air hot, and the fever very violent, they permitted ſwimming in cold water.</hi>

                  <p>A German ſhoemaker, of Zurich, if I remember right, was ſeized with the epidemic fever in the month of October 1755. I was ſent for on the third day, and ordered a vomit on the fourth, and other ſuitable me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines; but the obſtinate man drank very little, being averſe to it, nor did he obſerve ſuch a diet as I had preſcribed; on the eighth day I purged him; on the tenth the tumid inflation was ſo great, that the ſkin of the abdomen began to grow red from the violent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion: his breath was very ſhort from the impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the deſcent of the diaphragm, his pulſe was

ſmall, and what ſurprized me, he was almoſt free from a delirium. Being afraid of the miſchievous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences from a compreſſion of all the bowels, and an obſtructed reſpiration; finding no other cauſe but air rarefied by the bile, whoſe putrefaction he had not ſufficiently corrected by drinking, and being ſatisfied from feeling the abdomen before, that there was no obſtruction prior to the diſtemper; and having to do with a ſullen patient who would hardly conform to rules, and employing my thoughts in ſearching for a remedy, which would moſt quickly ſtrengthen the fibres, reſtrain the flatulency, and ſtop the putrefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; I recollected the obſervations of the antients and ſome moderns, and my own experience with reſpect to cold water. Having weighed them all carefully, I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a linnen cloth, twice doubled, dipt in cold ſpring water, to be applied over all the abdomen, and to be changed every quarter of an hour, and the patient to drink as often, three ounces of the ſame water. In two hours the ſwelling of his belly ſubſided, his reſpiration became eaſier; in leſs than three hours a flight colic came on, which produced many large bilious ſtools, with a continued diſcharge of wind; the linnen cloths were taken away, the following night he ſlept, and next day his belly was ſoft, the fever much abated, and in a ſhort time he got well, without changing his drink, which I often found exceeding ſalutary, and it is to be lamented that the uſe of water has grown obſolete. We give nothing now, unleſs it be prepared, and often ſpoiled by the apothecary's art. The wiſer antients, when the concoction was perfected gave cold water, an excellent ſtrengthener, and as much of it as the patient was willing to drink, as appears from the works of Hippocrates, Aretaeus, Galen, Alexander, Caelius, Aurelianus, and others. Galen has even re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached his co-temporaries for neglecting the uſe of cold water, and calls them Hydrophobi. Among the moderns Fernelius, Hoffman, Van Swieten, Kloekhof, Grainger, and many others have preſcribed cold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and added cautions for its uſe.</p>

                  <head>Of Bleeding in Bilious Fevers.</head>
                  <p>Thoſe people who are fond of venaeſection, attribute every diſeaſe to the blood, and are inceſſantly talking of a plethora and ſtagnation, and omit bleeding in no diſtemper, will be amazed, that I have not made the leaſt mention of it, though we frequently had heat, dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſkin, head-ach, a violent delirium, and acute fever, which might ſeem to require ſuch an evacuation. But it is a ſad misfortune to thoſe, whoſe phyſicians make no enquiry after the cauſe, and are forward to ſtop all violent fevers by bleeding; for when the fever is increaſed after the operation, it kills the patient. It is now four years ſince I publiſhed my opinion, that venaeſection is never uſeful when there is not a plethora; I may add, except in the beginning of an inflammatory diſtemper, or while it is in a crude ſtate, after violent exerciſe, being heated in the ſun, a fall, and in peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple only, that ſtrictly are not plethoric, but robuſt, ſanguineous and florid. And far from changing my mind ſince that time, I every day meet with the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous conſequences of bleeding, where theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions are not found. I grant that redundancy of blood may bring on diſtempers, which indicate bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but the blood repels diſtempers that do not ariſe from itſelf; for the more a perſon has of that vital fluid, provided he is not plethoric, and that is not fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the caſe now-a-days, the better is his ſituation, and he is the more able to reſiſt the production and attacks of other diſeaſes. The more blood therefore he looſes, the more obnoxious he will become to them; for it is abſolutely certain, that an evacuation of blood from a ſound man who is not plethoric, diſpoſes what is left to a cacochymy, depravity, and the diſorders proceeding from putrefaction.</p>
                  <p>It produces relaxation, and from thence debility with its conſequent diſorders, increaſes the irritability and paves the way for irregular commotions, as we learn by innumerable obſervations. For who has not ſeen bleeding followed by faintings, tremors flatulent ſpaſms as they are called, univerſal, or partial; a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium, fever and convulſions: when improperly uſed to
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:033590_0140_0FF7950B667D93A0"/>
ſeveral girls for fainting ſits, or hyſteric ſuffocations, it has brought on real and dreadful convulſive motions.</p>
                  <p>But it may be aſked, would bleeding not abate at leaſt, the frequency of the pulſe, or the fever? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it neither did nor could do this, for while it ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravates all the cauſes of the fever, it is difficult to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how it can mitigate the fever itſelf.</p>
                  <p>And beſides the obſervations furniſhed by our epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic, we are not deſtitute of others to confirm this theory. While I formerly attended the hoſpital of St. Eloy at Montpelier, a cuſtom prevailed there, which has been ſtrongly recommended by the practical phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians Gouraigne and Fifes, of bleeding in the height of the paroxiſm in intermittent and remittent fevers; and by this means I did not want opportunities of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving its effects in thoſe diſtempers, which amongſt the people of Guiene almoſt always approach to the bilious kind. And I ſolemnly profeſs that I ſeveral times found the pulſe quicker after bleeding; but I never could obſerve that its frequency abated, or that the paroxiſm was ſooner terminated. Only the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing accident once happened to a young man, who laboured under a tertian; a little after he had been blooded the bandage was looſened by chance; in a ſhort time he loſt ſuch a quantity of blood, that he had ſeveral fainting fits; his fever indeed preſently ceaſed, which I would have taken notice of, as conſonant to the doctrine of the ancients, but he was oppreſſed with a languor of long continuance. Two phyſicians had the care of the hoſpital, and they attended a fortnight each by turns: when one of them, the younger man, treated bilious and putrid malignant fevers by bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, purging, and cooling medicines, many patients preſently loſt the diſtemper and their lives together. The other, an older man, preſcribing a vomit at their firſt appearance cured almoſt all, <hi>ſpeedily, ſafely, and with eaſe to his patients.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Aretaeus, Celſus, Alexander every where agree with Hippocrates, that blood-letting is improper in bilious, or putrid fevers. I muſt confeſs that Galen appears to differ, when in ſeveral places he preſcribes bleeding

in putrid fevers; but any body, who reads over his works attentively may thus ſolve the difficulty. He has wrote in ſuch a manner as to advance ſeveral things often more from hyphotheſis than experience, he always ſuppoſes a fulneſs of the veſſels, which is to be remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, before other medicines are adminiſtered; but Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len is miſtaken, and the building falls of courſe when the foundation is deſtroyed, and contradicting himſelf more than once whenever he lays aſide the notion of a plethora, he proceeds upon no other doctrine than ours.

                  <p>I have hitherto oppoſed bleeding in bilious diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers by reaſon and authority; we muſt now conſider what light was offered by our fever. Among the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people I remember ſeveral, who died in a ſhort time after bleedings quickly repeated.</p>
                  <p>Not to leave our work imperfect, it remains to be explained, why illuſtrious phyſicians from antiquity
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:033590_0142_0FF7951047F73AF8"/>
down to our own times, have adviſed bleeding in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid fevers. I have already touched upon this point; the reaſon then is this, that there are two kinds of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid fevers, ſome ſimply putrid, in which phlebotomy is always hurtful, and which phyſicians who were truly ſkilled in the medical art, never attempted to cure by bleeding: but it muſt be obſerved that frequently men of fluent converſation, though deſtitute of all accurate erudition acquire the character of famous practitioners; and however illuſtrious they may be reckoned by their ignorant adherents, they are deemed by other phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians and impartial poſterity peſtilent quacks, whoſe deſtructive practice cannot be too cautiouſly avoided.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is of that kind of putrid diſeaſes, where there is a concomitant inflammation, in which bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is an admirable remedy. We are not yet ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently acquainted with the theory of inflammation, or the manner in which its ſtimuli act, to be able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, why it is ſometimes joined to a putrefaction, and ſometimes not; experience has convinced us that it is ſo, and diſtinctly ſhewn the pathognomic ſymptoms of both caſes; and every day's practice affords many inſtances of it; they are to be found both elſewhere, and in the elegant hiſtories of epidemics publiſhed by the illuſtrious Huxham. How me to inſiſt a little upon that which the celebrated Pringle has ſo accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately deſcribed. It is denominated indeed <hi>a bilious fever,</hi> but by an attentive conſideration it will ſoon appear, that the appellation is not comprehenſive enough; the ingenious author ſpeaks ſeveral times of an inflammation of the ſtomach; there was a true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory phrenzy, which he cured by antiphlogiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics. When the inflammation was removed, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained to combat with the bilious colluvies, which he judiciouſly diſlodged by vomits and purging, which in diſtempers purely inflammatory are found very hurtful. But the Edingburgh phyſician had to deal with ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſt ſoldiers, young, and bred in the mountains, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to drink ſpirituous liquors, and in fine, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to all the cauſes of inflammation, and in whom it very eaſily follows the application of a ſtimulus.
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:033590_0143_0FF79512B7F7BA70"/>
Thus the firſt miſchief of the putrid ferment was to produce an inflammation. If in ſuch circumſtances it had been attempted to vomit or purge before the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation was reſolved, it would have been attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the worſt conſequences. Such a diſtemper ought to be eſteemed and treated like an inflammation of the bowels."</p>
                  <p>Dr. SOLOMON DE MONCHY, of Rotterdam, in his Eſſay on the cauſes and cure of the uſual diſeaſes in voyages to the Weſt-Indies, tranſlated from the Dutch philoſophical tranſactions, and publiſhed at London in the year 1762, remarks that, "it has long ſince been the obſervation of many perſons, diſtinguiſhed by their medical abilities, that the multiplying diſeaſes, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the ſame, or only ſymptoms of or acceſſary to others, and the various appellations by which they have been diſtinguiſhed, has at all times been an embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both to the ſtudy and practice of phyſic, and has obſtructed its improvement; as the tremendous cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of diſtempers, beſides the load it charges on the memory, is a diſcouragemant to many, and muſt finally be productive of perplexity and confuſion.</p>
                  <p>Further, all the world knows, that one identical mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bific cauſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> according to its different force, its different ſeat, the difference of conſtitution, climate, ſeaſon and weather, produces ſymptoms, which though they may differ widely in their external appearances, and eſpecially in the degree of violence, yet the nature of the diſeaſe is the ſame, as being the effect of one and the ſame prox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imate cauſe; and therefore requires <hi>the like method of cure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It has been the opinion of ſome, that the <hi>ardent pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid fever,</hi> belonged to the claſs of inflammatory diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, though Hippocrates, by whom, it is termed the <hi>kauſes,</hi> i. e. <hi>febris ardens</hi> or <hi>burning fever,</hi> places it among the ſummer diſeaſes; and never among thoſe of the winter and ſpring.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="141" facs="unknown:033590_0144_0FF7951565CA7428"/>Another difference between inflammatory and <hi>bilious fevers</hi> and the others of that febrile claſs, is, that in hot weather, the <hi>former</hi> are more <hi>remittent</hi> and the latter leſs.</p>

                  <p>In the Low Countries, particularly Zealand, the moſt obſtinate diſeaſes of this kind frequently rage, and are particularly diſtreſſing to ſtrangers.</p>

                  <p>He obſerves, "that at Middleburgh, the capital of Weſt Zealand, where his father and himſelf had prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed twenty-eight years, a ſickneſs generally reigns to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the latter end of Auguſt, or the beginning of September, which is always moſt violent after hot ſummers.</p>
                  <p>"It makes its appearance after the rains, which generally fall in the latter end of July; the ſooner it begins, the longer it continues, being checked only by the coldneſs of the weather.</p>
                  <p>"Towards the end of Auguſt, and the beginning of September, it is a continual burning fever, attended with a vomiting of bile, which is called the gall-ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. This fever, after continuing three or four days, intermits, aſſumes the form of a double tertian, and leaves the patient in a fortnight, or perhaps ſooner; ſtrangers, who have been accuſtomed to breathe a dry pure air, do not recover ſo quickly.</p>
                  <p>"Foreigners, in indigent circumſtances, ſuch as the Scotch and German ſoldiers, who are garriſoned in the adjacent places, are apt, after thoſe fevers, to have a ſwelling in their legs, and a dropſy; of which many die.</p>
                  <p>"Fluxes are frequent in September and October; towards the latter end of which indeed the air becomes more healthy, and then few diſeaſes prevail. At this time, thoſe who have laboured under the fever ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſuffer a relapſe; but then it is into a ſimple ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, which ſeldom confines the patient."</p>
                  <p>The Doctor farther obſerves, "That thoſe diſeaſes are the ſame with the double tertian fevers, common between the tropics. Such," ſays he, "as are ſeized with the gall-ſickneſs, have, at firſt, ſome fluſhes of heat over the body, a loſs of appetite, a white foul tongue, a yellow tinge in the eyes, and a pale colour in the
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:033590_0147_0FF7951CCAAB9910"/>
lips. An emetic adminiſtered before the gall-diſeaſe appears, is ſerviceable. Bleeding is ſeldom requiſite, unleſs in perſons of a plethoric habit. The gall-ſickneſs is removed chiefly by cooling medicines; but, in Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the tertian agues cannot be cured without the bark.</p>
                  <p>"Such as live well, drink wine, have warm cloathing and good lodgings, do not ſuffer ſo much during the ſickly ſeaſon us the poor people: <hi>however thoſe diſeaſes are not infectious, and ſeldom prove mortal to the natives."</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>"The moſt frequent and fatal diſeaſes in the ſickly ſeaſon in Guinea are not of an inflammatory nature. Indeed ſo much harm has been done there by the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet, in the hands of ſuch as have read only Sydenham's works, or authors who treat of inflammatory fevers on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it is moſt adviſeable for the inexperienced in ſuch climates to abſtain altogether from its uſe, and to truſt the ſafety of their patients, in ſuch caſes, to vomits and the early application of bliſters, together with the uſe of tartarum emeticum, in ſmall doſes, or of antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial medicines of gentle operation, during the fever, and of the bark upon its firſt remiſſion; whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>The loſs of a ſmall quantity of blood, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a fever, does often neither good nor hurt; and there are diſeaſes incident to Europeans in that part of the world, eſpecially in the dry ſeaſon, which may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire even a repetition of that operation. But during the rainy or ſickly ſeaſon, in the caſe of Europeans la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring under the fever, it is ſeldom neceſſary to take away blood; and large and repeated bleedings are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with fatal conſequences. Nothing can be a plainer proof of the diſpoſition of the air in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, to produce remitting and intermitting fevers, than the common obſervation that thoſe who have had obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate agues in England or Holland, almoſt conſtantly ſuffer a relapſe when they come on this coaſt.</p>
                  <p>Bengal, next to Bencoolen, of all the Engliſh facto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, proves the moſt fatal to Europeans. The rainy ſeaſon commences at Bengal in June, and continues till October: the remainder of the year is healthy and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant.

During the rains, this rich and fertile country is almoſt quite covered by the overflowing of the river Ganges, and converted as it were into a large pool of water. Diſeaſes rage among the Europeans in the months of July, Auguſt, September, and October, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacking chiefly ſuch as are lately arrived. Here, as in all other places, ſickneſs is more frequent and fatal in ſome years than others. The diſtempers are fevers of the remitting or intermitting kind; ſometimes they may begin under a continued form, and remain ſeveral days without any perceptible remiſſion, but they have in general a great tendency to a remiſſion. They are commonly accompanied with violent fits of rigors or ſhiverings, and with diſcharges of bile upwards and downwards. If the ſeaſon be very ſickly, ſome are ſeized with a malignant fever, of which they ſoon die: the body is covered with blotches of a livid colour, and the corpſe in a few hours turns quite black and corrupted. At this time fluxes prevail, which may be called bilious or putrid, the better to diſtinguiſh them from others which are accompanied with an inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the bowels. In all thoſe diſeaſes at Bengal, the lancet is cautiouſly to be uſed.</p>
                  <p>I have been favoured, ſays Dr. Lind, with the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ingenious obſervations by Dr. Bogue of Titch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field.</p>
                  <p>'The diſeaſes moſt fatal at Calcutta, while I was there, in 1757, began with the rainy ſeaſon, and were obſtinate putrid intermitting fevers. The cold fit, which was exceſſively violent, continued often for twelve hours; and as the fever returned every day, the patients had not above four or five hours reſpite from it. During the rains, and for ſome time after, we had ſick, at the ſame time, in this place, one half of the men in the ſquadron under the command of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals Watſon and Pococke. Out of three ſhips of the line, and a 20 gun ſhip, and thoſe not fully manned, we loſt in ſix months upwards of 200 men, moſt of whom died of theſe fevers.</p>
                  <p>'Camphire was found the beſt medicine in the fit. Bark and other antiſeptics were adminiſtered in large
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:033590_0149_0FF795201E2404C8"/>
quantities, after firſt giving an emetic, and emptying the bowels. This fever reduced the patients in general to ſuch a weak ſtate, that Mr. Ives, then ſurgeon of that hoſpital, judged it abſolutely neceſſary to give arrack in their boiled rice to thoſe who were on the recovery, or who had not the diſorder in a violent degree. He likewiſe generouſly ſupplied them with Madeira wine.</p>
                  <p>'In the inflammatory fevers preceding the rainy ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, bleeding with caution was found of ſervice; but as ſoon as the rainy ſeaſon ſet in, the lancet was ſeldom or never uſed.</p>
                  <p>'A ſalivation generally cured the diſeaſe of the liver, if the ſpitting was brought on before matter was formed. In ſome the mercury produced a looſeneſs, which alſo cured the patient. In inflammations of the liver, when it adhered to the peritoneum, which was generally the caſe, and a tumor appeared externally, it was ſeveral times opened with ſucceſs.'</p>
                  <p>This gentleman again viſited India in the year 1772, where he had, for three years, the ſuperintendance of the naval hoſpitals. He is ſo obliging as farther to inform me, that when he was laſt in India, mercury was more in uſe on the Coromandel Coaſt, than it had ever been before. In bilious fluxes, when the common remedies failed, it was uſed with great ſucceſs, either by unction or internally, obſtructions in ſome of the viſcera being then ſuppoſed to be the cauſe of the diſeaſe. Fluxes of long ſtanding were ſeldom cured without it. In all bilious complaints, emetics were not ſo frequently given as formerly, being only intended to cleanſe the ſtomach, but the greateſt dependence was placed on mercurials, and purges given at a few days intermiſſion, which was ſuppoſed to be the moſt natural method of carrying off the bile.</p>
                  <p>'At Senegal, in the rivers Gambia and St. Domingo, on the Coaſt of Guinea, at Carpenter's River, near the Muſquitoe Shore, in the Weſt-Indies, and in many other places, I have been told, that almoſt all the European ſtrangers, at their firſt coming, loſe their appetite and colour, becoming yellow, and troubled with ſickneſs or indigeſtion; and that gentle vomits are found ſuitable to the diſeaſes in thoſe climates.</p>

                  <head>"REMARKS ON THE CURE.</head>
                  <p>"To expect ſucceſs in treating theſe fevers, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me neceſſary to pay particular regard to their different degrees of violence. For example, the bilious fever, in the north of Germany, is much leſs violent than the ſame fever is in Minorca; and this again, than thoſe frequent in Africa, or the Eaſt Indies.</p>
                  <p>"For the cure of the bilious fever moſt frequent while at ſea, bleeding in the beginning, eſpecially in athletic conſtitutions, was generally neceſſary; after which and the uſe of antimonial medicines and ſaline mixtures, the fever ſoon came to intermit; and then the Cort. Peru. being adminiſtered, a few days com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted the cure.</p>
                  <p>"But when the ſhips are in the ports of the Eaſt Indies, even though the fever runs high, blood-letting is ſo far from being adviſeable, that I believe it is hurtful. Of the patients violently attacked with this fever at Joanna, I bled only two, one of which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ied the day following, the other eſcaped by ſoon after taking the bark. Mr. Bruce alſo bled two of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients after leaving Mohila, one expired ſoon after, the other recovered.</p>
                  <p>"Dr. James Lind in his Treatiſe on the Remitting Fever of Bengal in 1762, obſerves, that by taking away only a few ounces of blood in the remiſſion, there followed ſuch a proſtration of ſtrength, that they ſunk under the violence of the next paroxiſm.</p>
                  <p>"During the rage of the Joanna fever, I began the cure with evacuants, &amp;c. in expectation of procuring a plain remiſſion or intermiſſion; but I found myſelf much diſappointed; for it aſſumed the appearance of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual fever, with now and then violent exacerbations, under which ſeveral ſunk. Fearing this might be the fate of the greateſt part of the remaining ſick, I without farther delay, gave between 30 and 40 patients in the different ſtages of the fever, Pulv. Cort. Peru. <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>i. in wine or wine and water every hour. Several with ſunk

pulſe, and apparently within a few hours of their end, were relieved in a few hours after taking a few doſes of the bark, and by continuing it for a day or two, recovered.</p>
                  <p>Dr. RUSH, in a paper read before the London Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical Society, Auguſt 8th, 1774, publiſhed in their 5th vol. at page 32, mentions, that of fifty or ſixty patients which he had attended in bilious fevers, the two preceding ſummers and autumns in Philadelphia, he had the misfortune of loſing but one, though he had conſtantly refuſed to comply with the ſolicitations of his patients with reſpect to <hi>bleeding.</hi> After emptying the ſtomach and bowels by emetic tartar and catha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Theſe remiſſions generally continued four hours, in ſome longer, in others not quite ſo long, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred for the moſt part once in twenty-four hours.— "I muſt here add (ſays Dr. Ruſh) that I attribute my ſucceſs in treating this fever to my giving the bark in ſubſtance, and in very large doſes: If it ever fails of breaking the fever, it is owing to its being given in too ſmall a quantity." He acknowledges his obligations to Dr. Archibald, of the iſland of Nevis, for the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom with which he uſed the bark, who had often given ℥ſs. of bark every half hour, for a whole day or night together in the Weſt-Indies, and that it would ſtay upon the ſtomach when no other medicine could be kept there.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Ruſh has alſo publiſhed an account of the bilious remitting fever, which was epidemic in Philadelphia in the year 1780, of which the following is an abſtract.</p>

                     <pb n="150" facs="unknown:033590_0153_0FF7952B2230C6F0"/>"THE ſpring of 1780 was dry and cool.</p>
                  <p>July and Auguſt were uncommonly warm. The mercury ſtood on the 6th of Auguſt at 94½°, on the 15th of the ſame month at 95°, and for ſeveral days afterwards at 90°.</p>

                  <p>The remitting fever made its firſt appearance in July and Auguſt, but its ſymptoms were ſo mild, and its extent ſo confined, that it excited no apprehenſions of its ſubſequent more general prevalence throughout the city.</p>
                  <p>On the 19th. of Auguſt the air became ſuddenly very cool. Many hundred people in the city complained, the next day, of different degrees of indiſpoſition, from a ſenſe of laſſitude, to a fever of the remitting type. This was the ſignal of the epidemic. The weather continued cool during the remaining part of the month, and during the whole month of September. From the expoſure of the diſtrict of Southwark (which is often diſtinguiſhed by the name of the <hi>Hill</hi>) to the ſouth-weſt winds, the fever made its firſt appearance in that appendage of the city. Scarcely a family, and in many families, ſcarcely a member of them, eſcaped it. From the Hill it gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually travelled along the ſecond-ſtreet from the Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, improperly called Front-ſtreet. For a while it was confined to this ſtreet only, after it entered the city,
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:033590_0154_0FF7952D942643A0"/>
and hence it was called by ſome people the <hi>Front-ſtreet Fever.</hi> It gradually ſpread through other parts of the city, but with very different degrees of violence. It prevailed but little in the Northern Liberties. It was ſcarcely known beyond fourth-ſtreet from the Delaware. Intemperance in eating or drinking, riding in the ſun or rain, watching, fatigue, or even a fright, but more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently cold, all ſerved to excite the feeds of this fever into action, wherever they exiſted.</p>
                  <p>All ages, and both ſexes were affected by this fever. Seven of the practitioners of phyſic were confined by it nearly at the ſame time. The city, during the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the fever, was filled with an unuſual number of ſtrangers, many of whom, particularly of the Friends (whoſe yearly meeting was held in the month of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember) were affected by it.</p>
                  <p>This fever generally came on with rigor, but ſeldom with a regular chilly fit, and often without any ſenſation of cold. In ſome perſons it was introduced by a ſlight ſore throat, and in others, by a hoarſeneſs which was miſtaken for a common cold. A giddineſs in the head was the forerunner of the diſeaſe in ſome people. This giddineſs attacked ſo ſuddenly, as to produce, in ſeveral inſtances, a faintneſs, and even ſymptoms of apoplexy. It was remarkable that all thoſe perſons who were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in this violent manner, recovered in two or three days.</p>
                  <p>I met with one inſtance of this fever attacking with coma, and another with convulſions, and with many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in which it was introduced by a delirium.</p>
                  <p>The pains which accompanied this fever were exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitely ſevere in the head, back, and limbs. The pains in the head were ſometimes in the back parts of it, and at other times they occupied only the eyeballs. In ſome people, the pains were ſo acute in their backs and hips, that they could not lie in bed. In others, the pains af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the neck and arms, ſo as to produce in one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance a difficulty of moving the fingers of the right hand. They all complained more or leſs of a ſoreneſs in the ſeats of theſe pains, particularly when they occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied the head and eyeballs. A few complained of their
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:033590_0155_0FF7952F27256C60"/>
fleſh being ſore to the touch, in every part of the body. From theſe circumſtances, the diſeaſe was ſometimes believed to be a rheumatiſm. But its more general name among all claſſes of people was, the <hi>Break-bone Fever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I met with one caſe of pain in the back, and another of an acute ear-ach, both of which returned periodically every night, and without any fever.</p>
                  <p>A nauſea univerſally, and in ſome inſtances, a vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, accompanied by a diſagreeable talle in the mouth, attended this fever. The bowels were, in moſt caſes, regular, except where the diſeaſe fell with its whole force upon them, producing a ſymptomatic dyſentery.</p>
                  <p>The tongue was generally moiſt, and tinctured of a yellow color.</p>
                  <p>The urine was high colored, and in its uſual quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in fevers.</p>
                  <p>The ſkin was generally moiſt, eſpecially where the diſeaſe terminated on the third or fourth day.</p>
                  <p>The pulſe was quick and full, but never hard in a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle patient that came under my care, till the 28th. of September.</p>
                  <p>It was remarkable, that little, and in ſome inſtances, no thirſt attended this fever.</p>
                  <p>A ſcreatus, or conſtant hawking and ſpitting, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in many caſes through the whole diſeaſe, and was a favourable ſymptom.</p>
                  <p>There were generally remiſſions in this fever every morning, and ſometimes in the evening. The exacer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bations were more ſevere every other day, and two exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerbations were often obſerved in one day.</p>
                  <p>A raſh often appeared on the third and fourth days, which proved favourable. This raſh was accompanied in ſome caſes by a burning in the palms of the hands and ſoles of the feet. Many people at this time, who were not confined to their beds, and ſome, who had no fever, had an effloreſcence on their ſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>In ſeveral perſons the force of the diſeaſe ſeemed to fall upon the face, producing ſwelling under the jaw and in the cars, which in ſome inſtances terminated in abſceſſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="153" facs="unknown:033590_0156_0FF79530CD7461B8"/>When the fever did not terminate on the third or fourth day, it frequently ran on to the eleventh, four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, and even twentieth day, aſſuming in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, according to its duration, the uſual ſymptoms of the typhus gravior, or mitior, of Doctor Cullen. In ſome caſes, the diſcharge of a few ſpoonfuls of blood from the noſe accompanied a ſolution of the fever on the third or fourth day; while in others, a profuſe haemorrhage from the noſe, mouth, and bowels, on the tenth and eleventh days, preceded a fatal iſſue of the diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>Several caſes came under my care, in which the fever was ſucceeded by a jaundice.</p>
                  <p>The diſeaſe terminated in ſome caſes without ſweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or a ſediment in the urine; nor did I find ſuch patients more diſpoſed to relapſe than others, provided they took a <hi>ſufficient quantity of the bark.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>About the beginning of October the weather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came cool, accompanied by rain and an eaſterly wind. This cool and wet weather continued for four days. The mercury in the thermometer fell to 60°, and fires became agreeable. From this time the fever evidently declined, or was accompanied with inflammatory ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms. On the 16th of October, I met with a caſe of inflammatory angina; and on the next day I vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited a patient who had a complication of the bilious fever with a pleuriſy, and whoſe blood diſcovered ſtrong marks of the preſence of the inflammatory diatheſis. His ſtools were of a green and black colour. On the third day of his diſorder the raſh appeared on his ſkin, and on the fourth, in conſequence of a ſecond bleeding, his fever terminated with the common ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of a criſis.</p>
                  <p>During the latter end of October, and the firſt weeks in November, the mercury in the thermometer fluctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated between 50° and 60°. Pleuriſies and inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory diſeaſes of all kinds now made their appearance. They were more numerous and more acute, than in this ſtage of the autumn, in former years. I met with one caſe of pleuriſy in November, which did not yield to leſs than <hi>four plentiful bleedings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="154" facs="unknown:033590_0157_0FF7953339A76E10"/>I ſhall now add a ſhort account of the METHOD I purſued in the treatment of this fever.</p>
                  <p>After evacuating the contents of the ſtomach and bowels, I gave ſmall doſes of tartar emetic mixed with Glauber's ſalt. This medicine exited a general per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration. It likewiſe kept the bowels gently open, by which means the bile was diſcharged as faſt as it was accumulated.</p>
                  <p>On the third or fourth day, in the afternoon, the pains in the head and back generally abated, with a ſweat which was diffuſed over the whole body. The pulſe at this time remained quick and weak. This was, however, no objection <hi>to the uſe of the bark,</hi> a few doſes of which immediately <hi>abated its quickneſs,</hi> and <hi>prevented a return of the fever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the fever continued beyond the third or fourth day without an intermiſſion, I always had recourſe to bliſters. Thoſe which were applied to the neck, and behind the ears, produced the moſt immediate good effects. They ſeldom failed of producing an intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the fever, the day after they were applied. Where delirium or coma attended, I applied the bliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the neck on the <hi>firſt</hi> day of the diſorder.</p>
                  <p>Where the fever did not yield to bliſters, and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the ſymptoms of typhus gravior or mitior, I gave the medicines uſually exhibited in both the ſpecies of that fever.</p>
                  <p>I took notice in the hiſtory of this fever that it was ſometimes accompanied by the ſymptoms of a dyſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. Where this diſorder appeared, I preſcribed le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient purges and opiates. Where theſe failed of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, I gave the bark in the intermiſſion of the pain in the bowels, and applied bliſters to the wriſts. The good effects of theſe remedies led me to conclude that the dyſentery was the febris introverſa of Doctor Sydenham.</p>
                  <p>I am happy in having an opportunity, in this place, of bearing a teſtimony in favour of the uſefulneſs of OPIUM in this diſorder, after the neceſſary evacuations had been made. I yielded, in preſcribing it at firſt, to the earneſt ſolicitations of my patients for ſomething
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:033590_0158_0FF79535A7D2FDF8"/>
to give them relief from their inſupportable pains, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly when they were ſeated in the eyeballs and head. Its ſalutary effects in procuring ſweat, and a remiſſion of the fever, led me to preſcribe it afterwards in almoſt every caſe, and always with the happieſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. Thoſe phyſicians enjoy but little pleaſure in practiſing phyſic, who know not how much of the pain and <hi>anguiſh of fevers, of a certain kind,</hi> may be leſſened by the judicious uſe of opium.</p>
                  <p>In treating of the remedies uſed in this diſorder, I have taken no notice of <hi>blood-letting.</hi> Out of ſeveral hundred patients whom I viſited in this fever, I did not meet with a ſingle caſe, before the 27th of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, in which the ſtate of the pulſe indicated this evacuation. It is true, the pulſe was <hi>full,</hi> but never <hi>hard.</hi> I acknowledge that I was called to ſeveral pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients who had been bled without the advice of a phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, who recovered afterwards on the uſual days of the ſolution of the fever. This can only be aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to that diſpoſition which Doctor Cleghorn atri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to fevers, to preſerve their types under every variety of treatment, as well as conſtitution. <hi>But I am bound to declare further, that I heard of ſeveral caſes, in which bleeding was followed by a fatal termination of the diſeaſe</hi>

                  <p>"Philadelphia became unuſually ſickly after the year 1778, during the late war, in conſequence of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows being overflowed to the ſouthward of the city, and of the cutting down of the trees by the Britiſh army, which formerly ſheltered the city from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations of the grounds to the north and north-weſt.

covered with filth, or with ſtagnating waters; and laſtly, from the more regular cleaning of the ſtreets, and the encloſure of a large and offenſive canal which croſſed two of the principal ſtreets near the centre of the city, Philadelphia, from having been formerly the moſt ſickly, has become one of the healthieſt cities in the United States."</p>
                  <p>SIR GEORGE BAKER, in a communication to the College of Phyſicians of London, publiſhed in the 3d vol. of their tranſactions, relates, that in obſtinate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termittents, which prevailed in London in the year 1782, he had obſerved evident good effects from ſmall doſes of calomel, taken two or three evenings ſucceſſively, and then followed by a purgative of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate ſtrength. He alſo mentions the caſe of a ſiph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litic patient with a quartan ague, who had not a ſingle return of the fever after the commencement of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livation.</p>
                  <p>It appears from a quotation in the ſame commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, that Dr. Willis, cotemporary of Syden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, had propoſed to cure a young lady by inducing a gentle ſalivation, to which ſhe conſented; and that the fever ceaſed as ſoon as he had affected a ſalivation, which he was twelve days in accompliſhing.</p>
                  <p>It appears from hiſtorical facts, collected by Sir George Baker, that the Peruvian bark, which Syden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham claims the credit of introducing into practice in London, belonged to an apothecary of the name of Talbor, whoſe cures were ſo remarkable and ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by its uſe, that he was knighted by King Charles the II. Harvey, Liſter, Hodges and Morton were all cotemporaries of Sydenham.</p>
                  <p>The ſame author ſays, that a medicine compoſed of arſenic and opium, (the doſe of which was a very few drops in water) was taken by ſome people, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſucceſsfully; but that now and then violent vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitings, colic, and dyſentery were the effects of it. He had alſo received information of an ague thus
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:033590_0160_0FF7953ACDDB8410"/>
cured, which was followed by a palſey of the lower limbs: and concludes, that it cannot be deemed to be a proper remedy for an intermittent fever, whilſt an intermittent fever is leſs formidable than arſenic.</p>
                  <p>Dr. CULLEN, in the firſt lines of his Practice of Phyſic, publiſhed in the year 1784, remarks, that, "The paroxiſms of pure intermittent fevers are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways finiſhed in leſs than twenty four hours: and though it happens that there are fevers which conſiſt of repeated paroxiſms, without any entire intermiſſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them; yet in ſome caſes it is obſerved, that, though the hot and ſweating ſtages of the paroxiſm do not entirely ceaſe before the twenty-four hours from their beginning have expired, they ſuffer however be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time, a conſiderable abatement or <hi>remiſſion</hi> of their violence; and at the return of the quotidian period, a paroxiſm is in ſome ſhape renewed, which runs the ſame courſe as before. This conſtitutes what is called a <hi>remittent fever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When in theſe remittents the remiſſion is conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and the return of a new paroxiſm is diſtinctly marked by the ſymptoms of a cold ſtage at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it; ſuch fevers retain ſtrictly the appellation of <hi>remittents.</hi> But when it happens, as it does in certain caſes, that the remiſſion is not conſiderable, is perhaps without ſweat, and that the returning paroxiſm is not marked by the moſt uſual ſymptoms of a cold ſtage, but chiefly by the aggravation or <hi>exacerbation</hi> of a hot ſtage, the diſeaſe is called a <hi>continued fever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In ſome caſes of continued fever, the remiſſions and exacerbations are ſo inconſiderable as not to be eaſily obſerved or diſtinguiſhed; and this has led phyſicians to imagine, that there is a ſpecies of fever ſubſiſting for ſeveral days together, and ſeemingly conſiſting of one paroxiſm only. This they have called a <hi>continent fever;</hi> but, in a long courſe of practice, I have not had an opportunity of obſerving ſuch a fever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="158" facs="unknown:033590_0161_0FF7953C70056948"/>It is, however, to be obſerved here, that the fevers of a continued form are to be diſtinguiſhed from one another; and that, while ſome of a very continued form do ſtill belong to the ſection of intermittents, there are others which, though ſtill conſiſting of ſeparate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated paroxiſms, yet, as different by their cauſes and circumſtances from intermittents, are to be diſtinguiſhed from the whole of theſe, and are more ſtrictly to be called and conſidered as <hi>continued.</hi> Such are moſt of thoſe which have been commonly ſuppoſed to be <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent;</hi> and thoſe which by moſt writers have been ſimply named <hi>continued;</hi> and which term I have employed as the title of a ſection, to be diſtinguiſhed from that of <hi>intermittent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall here add the marks by which, in practice, theſe different continued fevers may be diſtinguiſhed from one another.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe fevers of a continued form, which, however, ſtill belong to the ſection of intermittents, may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by their having paſſed from an intermittent or remittent form, to that of a continued; by their ſhewing ſome tendency to become intermittent, or at leaſt remittent; by their being known to have been oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by marſh miaſmata; and, for the moſt part, by their having but one paroxiſm, or one exacerbation or remiſſion, in the courſe of twenty-four hours.</p>
                  <p>On the other hand, continued fevers, to be more ſtrictly ſo called, may be diſtinguiſhed by their ſhewing little tendency to become intermittent or remittent in any part of their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>urſe, and eſpecially after the firſt week of their continuance, by their being occaſioned by human contagion, at leaſt by other cauſes than the marſh miaſmata; and by their having pretty conſtantly an exacerbation and <hi>remiſſion twice in the courſe of every twenty-four hours.</hi> In both caſes, the knowledge of the nature of the epidemic for the time prevailing, may have a great ſhare in determining the nature of the particular fever.</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to the form, or <hi>type,</hi> of fevers, this fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may be obſerved, that the quartan, while it has the longeſt interval, has, at the ſame time, the longeſt and
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:033590_0162_0FF7953EE6152928"/>
moſt violent cold ſtage; bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pon the whole, the ſhorteſt paroxiſm: That the tertian having a ſhorter interval than the quartan, has, at the ſame time, a ſhorter and leſs violent cold ſtage; but a longer paroxiſm: And, laſtly, that the quotidian, with the ſhorteſt interval, has the leaſt of a cold ſtage; but the longeſt paroxiſm.</p>
                  <p>The type of fevers is ſometimes changed in their courſe. When this happens, it is generally in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing manner: Both tertians and quartans change in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to quotidians, quotidians into remittents, and theſe laſt become often of the moſt continued kind. In all theſe caſes, the fever has its paroxiſms protracted longer than uſual, before it changes into a type of more frequent repetition.</p>
                  <p>It has been rendered probable, that the remote cauſes of fevers are chiefly contagions or miaſmata, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them of great variety. We have ſuppoſed that miaſmata are the cauſe of intermittents, and contagions the cauſe of continued fevers, ſtrictly ſo named; but we cannot with propriety employ theſe general terms. For, as the cauſe of continued fevers may ariſe from fomites, and may, in ſuch caſes, be called a miaſma; and as other miaſmata alſo may produce contagious diſeaſes; it will be proper to diſtinguiſh the cauſes of fevers, by uſing the terms <hi>human</hi> or <hi>marſh effluvia,</hi> rather than the general ones of contagion, or miaſma.</p>
                  <p>Nothing is more evident, than that blood-letting is one of the moſt powerful means of diminiſhing the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity of the whole body, eſpecially of the ſanguiferous ſyſtem; and it muſt therefore be the moſt effectual means of moderating the violence of reaction in fevers. Taking this as a fact, I omit inquiring into its mode of operation, and ſhall only conſider in what circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of fevers it may be moſt properly employed.</p>
                  <p>When the violence of reaction, and its conſtant atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, a pillogiſtic diatheſis, are ſufficiently manifeſt; when theſe conſtitute the principal part of the diſeaſe, and may be expected to continue throughout the whole of it, as in the caſes of <hi>ſynocha;</hi> then blood-letting is the principal remedy, and may be employed as far as the ſymptoms of the diſeaſe may ſeem to require, and
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:033590_0163_0FF79541500F6B70"/>
the conſtitution of the patient will bear. It is, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to be attended to, that a greater evacuation than is neceſſary, may occaſion a flower recovery, may render the perſon more liable to a relapſe, or may bring on other diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>In the caſe of <hi>ſynocha,</hi> therefore, there is little doubt about the propriety of blood-letting: But there are other ſpecies of fever, as the <hi>ſynochus</hi>

It is, therefore, neceſſary that, in many caſes, blood-letting ſhould be avoided; and even al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, during the inflammatory ſtate of the diſeaſe, it may be proper, it will be neceſſary to take care that the evac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>From all this it muſt appear, that the employing blood-letting, in certain fevers, requires much diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſkill, and is to be governed by the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the following circumſtances:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The nature of the prevailing epidemic.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The nature of the remote cauſe.</p>

                     <pb n="161" facs="unknown:033590_0164_0FF795431B4F2660"/>When, after the conſideration of theſe circumſtances, blood-letting is determined to be neceſſary, it ſhould be obſerved, that it is more effectual, according as the blood is more ſuddenly drawn off, and as the body is, at the ſame time, more free from all irritation, and, conſequently, when in a poſture in which the feweſt muſcles are in action.</p>
                  <p>Another evacuation whereby the quantity of fluids contained in the body can be conſiderably diminiſhed, is that of purging.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame time, this evacuation may induce a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable degree of debility; ſo, in thoſe caſes in which a dangerous ſtate of debility is likely to occur, purging is to be employed with a great deal of caution; and more eſpecially as the due meaſure of the evacuation is more difficult to be applied than in the caſe of blood-letting."</p>
                  <p>Dr. BLANE, in his obſervations on the Diſeaſes of Seamen, publiſhed in the year 1785, remarks, that, "Bilious remitting fevers ariſe in the ſame ſituations in hot climates, in which intermittents ariſe in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate ones.</p>

                  <p>The moſt <hi>diſtinguiſhing ſymptom</hi> is a copious <hi>ſecretion of bile,</hi> which attends it. The ſymptoms are peculiarly violent (to Europeans) at the beginning. This fever, when it ariſes merely from the effluvia of woods and marſhes, has a natural tendency to remit. But in many of thoſe that aroſe at Jamaica, little or no remiſſion was to be perceived. It was diſtinguiſhed from the ſhip fever by the bilious vomiting and ſtools, more violent delirium and head-ach, and by being attended with leſs debility.

                  <p>When from a freſh accumulation of bile the fever appears to be kept up, a repetition of evacuants is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and <hi>calomel</hi> will be found to anſwer remarkably well as a purgative, its ſtimulus being ſo extenſive as to looſen and bring away bile, when the ſaline purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives have failed of having that effect: And it will be ſtill more effectual for this purpoſe, if given alone in a doſe, from five to ten grs. and followed ſome hours afterwards by ſome other purgative.</p>
                  <p>If the fever ſhould not yield during the firſt week, but takes an unfavourable turn, the pulſe then becomes more ſmall and frequent, there is a general agitation, the tongue is tremulous when put out, great thirſt, dry ſkin and delirium.</p>

                  <p>Dr. B. MOSELEY, in his treatiſe on tropical diſeaſes, 3d edition publiſhed in the year 1792, remarks, that "At the ſetting in of autumnal diſeaſes, intermittents are always attended with a greater ſecretion of bile, than they are afterwards, when the ſeaſon has farther advanced. And the earlier the autumnal ſickly ſeaſon commences, the more the liver is affected, and the
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:033590_0166_0FF795476204FFE8"/>
greater is the quantity of bile attending them. For which reaſon, bark at that time is improper, when given without perfect intermiſſions. A patient can take much more bark, without injur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yellowneſs in the eyes, tenſion of the abdomen, and a cough, are generally produced by a few doſes of bark, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of autumn; and this is an infallible ſign, that the body is not properly prepared for it. But when the autumnal intermittants do not ſet in until Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, bark, in general, may be taken with ſafety, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much previous preparation, becauſe they are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Spring diſeaſes, in hot climates, though not always ſtrongly marked, have in general an inflammatory ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency; which tendency gradually declines with the ſeaſon, and diſappears in autumn.</p>
                  <p>The autumnal diſeaſes, in Jamaica, in the year 1776, ſet in, in November; the ſeaſon was cold and rainy. Fevers came on with a ſhivering; but a good inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion generally ſucceeded the firſt paroxiſm; in which, if eight or ten drahms of bark were given, all went on well: if not, the fever returned the next even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the following day only a remiſſion ſucceeded —bark then would not anſwer. The third fit univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally ended in a low continued fever, which required early bliſters, cordials, and ſtimulants, as the patients all ſunk very much, and many died.</p>
                  <p>The type of diſeaſes is very often diſſimilar, in the ſame ſeaſon, in a diſtrict only of a few miles. In hot, marſhy, low ſituations, autumnal intermittents have generally a putrid tendency; and ſometimes after a few paroxiſms degenerate into irregular, low, fevers, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with colliquative ſweats, and diarrhoeas. Here the early uſe of bark, in every climate, is proper; and the almoſt indiſcriminate adiminiſtration of it, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom attended with danger.</p>
                  <p>This locality of diſeaſe ought to be well conſidered, by thoſe who write for the information of others; and
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:033590_0167_0FF7954AB6E1A308"/>
ſhould not be confounded with the endemics of a country, or of a climate at large: for ſuch varieties occur in every part of the world.</p>
                  <p>On examining the ſituation of <hi>Modena,</hi> in Italy, I found many local circumſtances combined to make it probable that TORTI's extenſive adminiſtration of bark, had better reaſons to ſupport it than his theory; or than his adverſaries admitted. However, TORTI adopted the important diſtinction, between a <hi>corruptive,</hi> and a <hi>depurative</hi> intermittent; which is a diſtinction, I wiſh to inculcate between the tropics. In the former, which chiefly belongs to the autumnal ſeaſon, TORTI's doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine may ſometimes apply; and "ab ipſo exordio per corticem ſuppremi poterit<note n="*" place="bottom">Therapeutices Specialis, Lib. I. cap. viii. p. 60. Ed. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netiis, 1769.</note>;" but in the latter, if there be not an intermittent diſpoſition in the ſeaſon, or ſome local putrid tendency, it will be found that bark is not always neceſſary in the cure of intermittent fevers; and that frequently, by obſtructing ſome deſign of nature, does great miſchief, and particularly when given too early.</p>
                  <p>The notions of aſthenia, and putridity, ſo univerſally prevailed in Jamaica, at the time of my arriving in the i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſland, that the word <hi>inflammatory,</hi> as connected with fever, was ſcarcely known; and copious, or repeated bleeding, was in general conſidered as an agent of death.</p>
                  <p>There had been violent contentions formerly on theſe points, particularly as referring to the yellow fever: but no perſon had ever defined that fever with accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, nor conſidered it as a genuine inflammatory diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>The two unfortunate phyſicians <hi>Williams</hi> and <hi>Bennet,</hi> at Kingſton, who terminated their diſputes on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject by killing each other in a duel on the 29th of December 1750, both, adopted the opinion that the yellow fever was a <hi>bilious fever,</hi> and gave it that appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; and though <hi>Williams's</hi> intentions of cure were
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:033590_0168_0FF7954C63A1FA90"/>
rational, yet it did not appear that he was able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh this diſeaſe from others which are <hi>really bili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> and peculiar to that part of the world.</p>
                  <p>This want of diſcrimination had always exiſted in the Weſt-Indies; and the conſequence was, that cardiacs and refrigerants, evacuants and bark, emetics and bleeding, frequently, and fatally, uſurped the place of each other."</p>
                  <p>According to the obſervations of the accurate Dr. Jackſon, "the paroxiſms of the fever of Jamaica are obſerved in many inſtances, to terminate in more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>remiſſions,</hi> than the paroxiſms of the endemic of North America, which is known to be fundamentally an <hi>intermitting fever.</hi> Hence authors are generally of opinion, that all the difference which appears to take place in thoſe fevers, depends merely on accidental cauſes, viz. on the greater or leſs heat of the climate and moiſture of the ſoil</p>
                  <p>The common fever in that part of Jamaica called <hi>Savanna La Mar</hi> from the year 1774 to 1778, was not only diſpoſed to terminate of its own accord; but it was diſpoſed to terminate on certain critical days, often at an early period, and by ſigns of criſis too clear to be miſtaken; neither did the Peruvian bark, in the manner at leaſt, in which it was managed, ever cut ſhort its courſe with certainty. The endemic of America, on the contrary, often laſted long. It frequently indeed, changed to another diſeaſe, after a length of time; but no period could be aſſigned for its natural termination, eſpecially in the northern ſtates. Neither did the Peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian bark. though its effects were ſo equivocal in the fevers of Jamaica, ſcarcely ever fail of ſtopping the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the fever. To which we may add, that the complaint which, ſtrictly ſpeaking, is called the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittent or ague and fever, can ſcarcely be ſaid to belong to Jamaica; at leaſt it was not known at Savanna-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>a-Mar.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="166" facs="unknown:033590_0169_0FF7954ED7148DD8"/>The fever that chiefly prevailed at Savanna-La-Mar, was uſually mild in its ſymptoms, and more regularly remitting in its form, than in moſt other parts of the Iſland. Savanna-La-Mar is ſituated cloſe by the ſea; its particular ſcite, and the ſurrounding country, to the diſtance of ſeveral miles, is perfectly level; whilſt in conſequence of its being open to the ſea on the eaſt, it is viſited early and conſtantly, by a ſalutary and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing breeze. It is however, almoſt ſurrounded on the north by a moraſs, from whence it might be ſuſpected to be unhealthy, but this is not the caſe.</p>
                  <p>The ſea at high water, particularly at ſpring tides, overflows the ſwampy ground, and in a great meaſure, perhaps, prevents the uſual noxious qualities of marſh exhalations.</p>
                  <p>The prevailing fever in the ſouthern ſtates of America, often loſes its diſtinctive marks of intermiſſion, in the hot months of ſummer; whilſt it approaches in other reſpects, ſo near the fever of Jamaica; as to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from it with difficulty.</p>
                  <p>This was particularly the caſe at Ebenezer in Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia, in the year 1779, during the months of June and July. A cold ſit was ſeldom obſerved in this place; unleſs, perhaps, in the firſt attack; lowneſs, languor, head-ach, pain of the back, and other diſagreeable feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, remained even in the moſt perfect remiſſions. The diſeaſe was likewiſe much diſpoſed to terminate of its own accord, on critical days: Yet though theſe reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances were very ſtriking, the fever of Ebenezer was perfectly under the controul of the Peruvian bark, which was not exactly the caſe with thoſe of Jamaica. But the fevers of the various iſlands in the Aegean ſea, as deſcribed by Hippocrates, and of Minorca, by the accurate Cleghorn, bear the neareſt reſemblance to the endemic of Savanna-La-Mar.</p>
                  <p>The fevers of Italy, of different parts of the continent of Aſia, as deſcribed by various writers, as well as the endemic of North America, ſeem to be degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated or rather imperfect intermittents, than the diſeaſe commonly underſtood by the appellation of remittent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="167" facs="unknown:033590_0170_0FF7955218C64518"/>The different time of day at which fevers of a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent type uſually commence, is a matter of no ſmall cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity. The ſingle tertian at Jamaica for inſtance, was conſtantly obſerved to begin in the forenoon, uſually between the hours of eight and eleven; while thoſe forms of diſeaſe that were evidently quotidian, or ſtill more continued, as conſtantly began in the evening ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally from four to eight. This ſeemed to be a fixed diſtinction, and it is an important one. (It is alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly mentioned as a fact, by Dr. George Fordyce, in his Eſſay on Simple Fever, publiſhed in the year 1794, that the paroxiſm of the continued fever always com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mences in the evening.)</p>
                  <p>This rule reſpecting the connection between the hour of invaſion and the type of the fever, does not hold true in the different parts of the continent of America; for there the moſt uſual hour of the invaſion of the ſingle tertian, was twelve at noon; though in ſome caſes, the paroxiſm came on as early as ten in the morning, or as late as two in the afternoon.</p>
                  <p>Of the bilious vomiting, ſo much inſiſted on by Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len as a diſtinguiſhing mark of the ſingle tertian, I can only ſay, that I conſtantly obſerved ſuch evacuations to be more frequent in the different forms of the tertian, than in thoſe that appeared to be quotidian, or that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached nearer to a continued type."</p>
                  <p>"The general nature of the cauſe of fever, or the nature of its various modifications is a myſtery, which we do not as yet know. We only know, that when preſent in a certain ſtate of vigour and activity, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranges or diſturbs the actions and functions of the ſyſtem; while we likewiſe know, that it does not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways diſturb every action or every function in the ſame degree. It has occurred too often to have eſcaped the moſt ſuperficial obſervation, that where one part of the body ſuffers particularly, the others are often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in proportion. We frequently in this manner obſerve, that general fever is diminiſhed by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of local pain; or, on the contrary, increaſed by its removal. It likewiſe often happens from the ſame principle, that where the ſtomach and biliary
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:033590_0171_0FF79553AB832130"/>
ſyſtem ſuffer much, there is leſs diſorder in the other parts: and on the other hand, that where theſe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings are removed or mitigated, the general fever runs higher, and often continues high, till the ſame, or other local affections, are again produced. Thus, though we are totally ignorant of the intimate nature of the cauſe of fever, we ſtill perceive very plainly, that it either poſſeſſes ſomething in its own nature, or accidentally meets with ſomething in the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the individual, which determines it to affect the different parts of the body in an unqual degree. <hi>It uſually exerts its greateſt force upon parts, which are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternaturally weakened by the general influence of climate, ſeaſon, ſituation, or other accidental cauſes.</hi> Hence bilious appearances are common in the hoteſt months of hot climates, pneumonic affection in cold and dry weather, greater degrees of vaſcular excitement among the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate and more active races of men; while ſymptoms of nervous affection prevail among the luxurious and enfeebled. The above, with other ſpecies of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed action of the cauſe of fever on a particular part of the body, depend wholly, perhaps, on circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of accident; yet it has ſo happened, that thoſe ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular determinations hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> unfortunately been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as the efforts, which nature employs to expel from the body a cauſe, which diſturbs the economy of health I ſhall not, at preſent go ſo far as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that theſe determinations are not, in fact, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of nature; but ſhall only beg leave to ſuggeſt, if they actually are intentions, that it is mere chance which determines whether they are ſalutary or fatal. It is a truth which nobody will deny, where the force of the diſeaſe is accidentally directed to an organ of excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or to a part of little importance to life, that the reſt of the body is often proportionably relieved, and even that a recovery of general heaith is ſometimes the conſequence; yet the contrary is the effect, where the functions of the part, upon which the force of the fever has been thus accidentally diverted, are of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate importance to the action of living. The Gout, a diſeaſe, the cauſe of which bears no very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:033590_0172_0FF79555625DD618"/>
analogy to the cauſe of fever, may be adduced as affording an illuſtration of this truth. The proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate cauſe of gout, is equally hid from us as the proximate cauſe of fever. We know, however, that the one equally with the other, has a tendency to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy life. We likewiſe know, that there is a power or principle in the conſtitution, which to a certain degree reſiſts deſtruction. The nature of this power, however, is unknown. We are not only in the dark with regard to its nature; but we can only form con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures about the part where it principally reſides.— We, however, clearly perceive its force and activity to be different in different parts of the body. We may next be allowed to remark, that where the cauſe of gout is in a certain ſtate of modification, tumults, (which properly enough may be termed re-action,) ariſe in the ſyſtem, and go on to continue till this cauſe or hurtful matter finds an outlet from the body, or a lodgment on one particular part. The outlets from the body are numerous: the parts on which the gout ſeems principally to fix its ſeat, are the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, where the power of reſiſtance is ſmalleſt.— The vital principle, however, becomes weaker as man advances in years; and the cauſe of the diſorder ſeems then frequently to find accommodations in parts, which are leſs remote from the ſources of life. This more eſpecially is the caſe, where tone and vigour have been preternaturally weakened. Hence the ſtomach, the bowels, ſometimes the brain, and even the heart itſelf ſuffer from the immediate action of this diſeaſe, in the latter periods of life. But though no perſon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps will deny, that the cauſe of gout finds readieſt accommodation, (if I may ſo apply the term) in thoſe parts of the body, where the vital powers are naturally weak, or have been accidentally weakened from va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious cauſes; yet we may add, that it is likewiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from the parts, on which it has been thus fixed, by ſuch applications as excite their active powers; or, in other words, which call forth the local re-action of the ſyſtem. We may alſo obſerve, that tumults ariſe in the general ſyſtem, in conſequence of this repreſſion
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:033590_0173_0FF79557CD746988"/>
or repulſion of the morbid cauſe from a particular part; and that they do not in general ceaſe, till an outlet is opened, or accommodation found in ſome other parts of the body. The above appearances, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur daily in the hiſtory of gout. They ſeem to bear a ſtrong analogy to thoſe irregular determinations, which frequently take place in fevers, and their cauſe perhaps is the ſame. We do not perceive any other law by which they can be explained, than the natural or adventitious ſtate of activity of the powers of life, which reſiſt deſtruction with unequal force in the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent parts of the ſyſtem: ſo that we ſhall be obliged to conclude, that thoſe ſufferings, which have hitherto been ſtyled the efforts of nature, are in reality more of the paſſive than of the active kind.</p>
                  <p>The circumſtances which I have now mentioned, combat the very exiſtence of the opinion, which has been commonly received with regard to the vis me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatrix naturae. I have hinted, that the extent and limits of that principle are narrow, and that the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutary effects are accidental. I ſhall next endeavour to ſhew, that they cannot, without danger, be made the baſis of the general plan of cure in febrile diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes. The taſk is important, but the attempt may be thought preſumptuous, as an opinion, contrary to that which I advance, has obtained almoſt the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal conſent of mankind. I have no deſire of chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing names, or of making diſtinctions, where there is in fact no difference. I perfectly acquieſce in retaining the word vis medicatrix naturae, provided it is limitted to a certain mode of re-action, or to a power in the conſtitution of reſiiſting deſtruction unequally in its different parts, in conſequence of which, irregular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations ſometimes prove ſalutary by accident; yet I muſt add, that if we mean to denote by this term a ſyſtem of laws, which have the beſt directed tendency to remove from the body a cauſe which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys health, and endangers life, the opinion has a very uncertain foundation. There are few perſons ſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, or ſo blindly devoted to the doctrines of <hi>autokratcia</hi> as not to own, that the uſually reputed efforts of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:033590_0174_0FF7955A38F87CE8"/>
are often ill directed, ſometimes pernicious: in ſhort, that they are obviouſly the cauſes of death. The truth of this obſervation cannot be denied, and unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately it obliges the advocates of the vis medicatrix naturae, to grant the concluſion, that the laws of the principle are imperfect. The works of the author of nature, as far as our limited knowledge can trace them, are univerſally without defect, if examined according to the plan on which they have been originally formed. If they appear otherwiſe, it becomes us to heſitate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we decide. We may not have comprehended the fundamental principle of the deſign; but we revolt from the idea, that the execution would be left im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, had it been intended by the Author of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the mechaniſm of the frame would be ſuch, as ſhould oppoſe and remove, in the moſt effectual manner, the derangements of the morbid cauſe. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and imperfection can have no place in the deſigns of the Almighty. Had it actually been the original de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of our Creator, that the human body ſhould be provided with a ſyſtem of the beſt concerted laws for reſtoring its health, when deranged by the numerous cauſes of diſeaſes, as it is impious to ſuppoſe, that thoſe laws could be defective ſo we may reaſonably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the effects of fevers would not then have been fatal. We find however, that fevers, as well as other diſeaſes, are fatal to people of all ages and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions: and that nature's intention of cure, if they really are intentions, are often deſtructive to herſelf. I need ſcarcely remind the reader of examples of their pernicious tendency. Vomiting, ſweating, increaſed diſcharges by ſtool, &amp;c. are generally conſidered as the ſalutary efforts of nature: but inſtances are numerous, where the exceſs of thoſe evacuations have obviouſly proved the cauſes of death. In the ſame manner, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſceſſes, which in the remote parts of the body, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times attend, and even ſometimes perhaps influence the favourable termination of fevers; in the brain, or in other organs of importance, are no leſs certainly the cauſe which deſtroys life. In both inſtances the deſign of nature, if it can be called a deſign, is the ſame. The
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:033590_0175_0FF7955CB5D5EFC8"/>
force of the diſeaſe being turned principally upon one part, the reſt of the body is in a great meaſure relieved from its ſufferings;—but the health and ſtructure of the part are hurt or deſtroyed by the change; and it depends wholly upon the accidental importance of the organ, upon which this diverſion has been made, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther death or recovery is the conſequence. Thus it often happens, that the reputed indications of nature prove the immediate cauſes which deſtroy the exiſtence of the individual; a fact not reconcileable, with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite power and wiſdom of the Author of our being.</p>
                  <p>I have inſinuated, that the efforts of nature are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain and precarious. They depend on accidental determinations to different parts of the body; and I may add, that if we endeavour to inveſtigate the cauſe, which directs the mechaniſm of the frame, to adopt one ſpecies of effort, or one mode of determination in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to another, we ſhall not perhaps be able to find any other, than a difference in the ſtates of the powers of life, which reſiſt deſtruction with unequal degrees of force in the different parts of the body. Where there is the leaſt reſiſtance, either from the natural or acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental circumſtances of the conſtitution, there the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe moſt obviouſly exerts its greateſt force: Hence we are ſufficiently warranted to conclude, that though the ſtructure of the human body is perfect with reſpect to every purpoſe for which it is intended, being only endued with a principle, which reſiſts deſtruction, or perſiſts in continuing life to a certain degree; yet that it is extremely defective, if we conſider it as a machine furniſhed with a ſyſtem of laws, which have an inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable and well directed tendency to reſtore health by the moſt judicious and rational efforts. The reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of health, in conſequence of this re-action, or ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular determination which takes place in the ſyſtem, is only a circumſtance of accident. The ſkill of man ſometimes ſucceeds, where the efforts of nature have obviouſly failed.</p>

                  <head>Of the particular cure of the fever of Jamaica.</head>
                  <p>THE fever, which prevailed in the diſtrict of Savan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na-La-Mar, was naturally a diſeaſe of the remitting kind; yet circumſtances were ſometimes connected with it, in ſuch a manner as prevented it from aſſuming its proper form. To remove thoſe circumſtances, which thus maſked or concealed the real genius of the diſeaſe, was conſidered as the firſt ſtep towards a cure. The accompliſhment of this purpoſe, however, was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times difficult; neither could it always be effected by the ſame means. Thus it happened frequently in caſes, where there was exceſs of excitement, or a high degree of inflammatory diatheſis, that the remiſſions where ſcarcely perceptible; as it was likewiſe obſerved, that where there was a want of reaction, the paroxiſms were often languid and obſcure. In the one caſe, the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions diſcovered themſelves in conſequence of bleeding, dilution and copious evacuation; in the other, wine and cordials determined the diſeaſe to aſſume its proper ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine form.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place, evacuations were uſually employed as the means of procuring remiſſion, where the inflama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory diatheſis prevailed in exceſs; I may add, that they were proper for the moſt part, and that they ſeldom failed of producing the effect. Bleeding was frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary, and generally of ſervice. Its efficacy, however, was often heightened by particular modes of management. Thus relaxation of ſpaſms, and removal of inflammatory diatheſis, more certainly followed bleeding, if the blood was drawn from a large orifice; if the patient was placed in an erect poſture, during the operation; and more certainly ſtill, if the lower extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities were at the ſame time immerſed in warm water. When bleeding had been premiſed, and repeated ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the circumſtances and urgency of the caſe, it was then cuſtomary to open the body freely: for which purpoſe, I have not found any thing anſwer bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than a thin ſolution of Glauber or Epſom ſalts, with a ſmall portion of emetic tartar. The operation of this medicine was extenſive. It might be ſo managed
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:033590_0177_0FF79560B880EF70"/>
as to occaſion nauſea, or moderate vomiting; to operate briſkly downwards, or to promote a gentle diaphoreſis. Remiſſions were generally the conſequence of this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of proceeding, where there was no defect in the manner of conducting it. But where it ſo happened, that the circumſtances of the patient forbad the uſe of this laxative; or where it might not be proper to carry it to a ſufficient length, benefit was derived from a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, compoſed of nitre, camphire, emetic tartar and opium, given in pretty large doſes, and repeated fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently. Remiſſion, at leaſt a great abatement in the violence of ſymptoms, was generally the conſequence of this plan of treatment; particularly, if aſſiſted by the plentiful dilution of watery liquors, by warm bathing and large glyſters of ſimple water. It is ſuperfluous to mention the uſe of bliſters in caſes of local affection; but it will be leſs expected, that this remedy ſhould be recommended in fevers, where there is an exceſs of the general inflammatory diatheſis.—I can, however, bear teſtimony to its efficacy. The manner by which bliſters produce their effects, is not yet agreed upon among authors; neither do I pretend to throw any new light upon the ſubject; but I would beg leave to ſuggeſt, that the mode of affording relief in the preſent, at leaſt, did not ſeem to be much unlike the effect of local af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, in conſequence of which the violence of fevers is ſometimes obſerved to ſubſide.</p>
                  <p>I purſued the above method of procuring remiſſion in thoſe fevers, were there was real inflammatory dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis prevailing in exceſs; but it ſo happened, that the ſigns of this diatheſis were fallacious, appearing in ſome inſtances to be preſent, though the real genius of the diſeaſe was actually of a different nature; a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, which occaſioned a difference of manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in conducting the method of cure. Exceſſive evacuations were not only unſafe in ſuch caſes, but in general had not any powerful effects in diſpoſing the diſeaſe to aſſume a remitting form. Bleeding, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, was often found to be neceſſary, though it was ſeldom requiſite to repeat the operation. The good effects which were obſerved to follow the uſe of cathar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics,
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:033590_0178_0FF795640C70F3A8"/>
were not in general very remarkable; yet it was proper, in moſt inſtances, to open the body freely; for which purpoſe, no form of medicine, with which I am acquainted, anſwered better than a ſolution of ſalts with a ſmall portion of emetic tartar, and ſometimes with the addition of laudanum. In caſes of local pain, bliſters applied near the ſeat of affection were always of eminent ſervice; and in caſes of general irritability, they were often equally uſeful, when applied to the back part of the head and neck. A powder compoſed of nitre, camphire, emetic tartar and opium, was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe employed with ſucceſs; but the liberal uſe of warm bathing, was ſtill more to be depended upon. No perſon, perhaps, will refuſe conſent to the method of proceeding, which I have hitherto recommended; but when I mention a free and bold uſe of cold bathing, even in an early ſtage of this fever, I do not expect the ſame conceſſion. To daſh cold water on the head and ſhoulders of a perſon in a fever, has an appearance of raſhneſs and hazard. I can, however, produce the teſtimony of repeated experience for the ſafety of the practice, no leſs than for its ſucceſs in procuring remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and ſhall therefore conſider it a duty to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it warmly to the public. Wherever it was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,—and the caſes in which it was tried were nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, a calm and equable perſpiration, additional tone and vigor, with great abatement of irritability, were conſtantly obſerved to enſue.</p>
                  <p>The paroxiſms and remiſſions were generally diſtinct in the beginning of fevers, where the nervous ſyſtem was principally affected; but often became leſs ſo, as the diſeaſe advanced in its progreſs; a circumſtance which did not ariſe oftner from the nature of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, than from the common method of treatment. Bleeding was often diſpenſed with in the fevers of the Weſt-Indies; but vomiting and purging were indulged in with freedom. The diſtinction of paroxiſm and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion was ſometimes evidently rendered obſcure by this practice; while it was likewiſe obviouſly reſtored again, by the uſe of wine and cordials, which excited the powers of life. In this ſpecies of diſeaſe, evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:033590_0179_0FF795659D66BFA8"/>
were ſeldom neceſſary; ſeldom indeed admiſſible in a great extent. Bleeding, unleſs under particular circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, was totally improper. Cathartics were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times dangerous, and antimonial vomits often ſunk the patient irrecoverably. Bliſtering, on the contrary, even at an early period, was generally of ſervice; as alſo were opiates, and a judicious uſe of the warm bath; but cold bathing with ſalt water, was, of all others, the remedy of the moſt powerful effect. I do not pretend to ſay, that it abſolutely ſtopped the courſe of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; but I can ſay with truth, that it generally reſtored the diſtinction of paroxiſm and remiſſion, diminiſhed irritability, and imparted a degree of tone and vigour to the ſyſtem, which was juſtly conſidered as a ſign of ſafety.</p>
                  <p>To procure remiſſion in fever, diſtinguiſhed by a prevalence of the putreſcent tendency, is not in every inſtance an eaſy taſk. A remitting, with marks of ſpecific putrefaction, is not a diſeaſe of common occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in Jamaica; but a fever with ſigns of putrefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive tendency, mixed with ſymptoms of great irritabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, or a high decree of malignity, is not altogether rare. From the complicated nature of the diſorder, the indications of cure are often difficult and perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Bleeding is univerſally condemned; more, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, from theory than from actual obſervation. It was, and perhaps ſtill is, a faſhionable mode of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to impute the languors and other marks of debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which are common in the fevers of the Weſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, to a putreſcent tendency in the ſyſtem. Such ſymptoms however are in fact more generally the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants, or diſtinguiſhing ſigns of fevers, where the nervous ſyſtem is affected. In ſuch caſes, bleeding is obviouſly hurtful; in the one of which we now treat, (where ſuch a diſeaſe actually exiſts,) it is not only a remedy of ſafety, but of very eminent ſervice, previous to the application of cold, particularly previous to cold bathing, which may be uſed with freedom and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Cold bathing, indeed, is the remedy on which we muſt principally depend. There are others which do good occaſionally; but this is the only one I know,
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:033590_0180_0FF79568244F74B8"/>
which has any very conſiderable effect in changing the nature of the diſeaſe. There is a general rule in the practice of medicine, which a requires to be particularly remembered in thoſe complicated ſpecies of fever, viz. that as the indications of cure are often embarraſſed; ſo the appearances, which principally point to danger, are firſt to be attended to; while the plan of cure, which we determine to be the moſt proper, muſt be followed up with vigour and reſolution. We ought always to bear in mind, that in dangerous and difficult caſes feeble remedies, or even powerful ones timidly uſed, are of little avail. Cold bathing, employed with timidity, failed of doing good in ſome inſtances. I met with no example, where the boldeſt uſe of it did harm. It was ſeldom, I muſt again repeat, that it did not ſucceed in obviating irritability, in checking the putreſcent tendency, and in imparting to the ſyſtem that degree of tone and vigour, in which ſafety is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to conſiſt.</p>
                  <p>The method of procuring remiſſion, in thoſe fevers which were diſtinguiſhed by local affections, or irregular determinations to particular parts, was nice, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times difficult. Bleeding was frequently proper, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, if there ſubſiſted at the ſame time marks of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inflammatory diatheſis: but it was ſeldom ſufficient wholly to accompliſh the buſineſs. However, together with a judicious management of warm bathing, it greatly heightened the good effects of bliſters, the remedy on which the principal dependence was placed. In fevers which were accompanied with uncommon pain of the head, I have ſometimes found it ſerviceable to apply cold to the part affected; the feet being at the ſame time immerſed in warm water, and blood flowing by a large orifice from the arm. I alſo frequently obſerved, that the general fever ran higher, though it likewiſe more certainly aſſumed its proper form, in conſequence of bleeding, bliſtering, and the removal of local pain. In thoſe fevers, where bilious appearances were the effect of accidental, irregular determination to the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach or liver, the remiſſions were often obſcure: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did the method of treatment, which was generally
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:033590_0181_0FF79569B53546E0"/>
adopted, ſeem to be well calculated to bring forth the natural, genuine appearance of the diſeaſe. Bilious appearances. it muſt be owned, ſometimes vaniſhed, while the type of the fever became more diſtinct after the exhibition of an emetic or briſk cathartic; yet there is cauſe to doubt if this depended on the evacuation of bile. It might be ſaid, with more truth, perhaps, that the action of the emetic, by exciting the powers of the ſtomach and biliary ſyſtem, effected a change in the irregular determination, which had formerly taken place to thoſe parts. It was generally obſerved, where good effects did not follow the firſt exhibition of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies of this kind, that harm was uſually the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of a ſecond. Vomiting, in ſhort, was often ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered continual, and the diſtinction of paroxiſm and remmiſſion was apparently deſtroyed, in conſequence of the operation of violent emetics. Inſtructed by repeated examples of their hurtful effects, I at laſt ſcarcely ever employed antimonial vomits; even the ſafeſt kind were uſed with caution. If it appeared, at any time, that the action of vomiting would be ſerviceable, camomile tea, or at fartheſt a few grains of ipecacuana were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally thought ſufficient for the purpoſe. When this buſineſs was finiſhed, a draught of cordial ſtimulating liquor, which had a tendency to promote a diaphoreſis, was next adminiſtered. By this mode of treatment, eſpecially if a bliſter was applied at the ſame time to the region of the liver, I have the ſatisfaction to add, that the bilious appearances for the moſt part vaniſhed, and, if care was taken to ſupport a determination to the ſurface, ſeldom ever returned during the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the fever. Different ſeaſons, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> different ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations of country were particularly diſtinguiſhed by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponding determinations. Thus a tendency to the bowels and biliary ſyſtem was chiefly remarkab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e in the autumnal months, and in low and champaign countries; the head and breaſt were oftener affected in the winter months, and in hilly ſituations.</p>
                  <p>I obſerved before, that it is the firſt object in the cure of fevers, to remove thoſe circumſtances, or acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental ſtates of the body, which hinder the diſeaſe from
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:033590_0182_0FF7956C32859FD0"/>
aſſuming its proper form. Thus, to procure remiſſion, appeared univerſally to be the firſt buſineſs in the cure of the fever of Jamaica; the next, and a very impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant one, is to prevent the return of the paroxiſm. If we knew a remedy, which could be depended upon to accompliſh this purpoſe with certainty, the cure of the diſeaſe would be eaſy; but the Peruvian bark, which almoſt infallibly ſtops the courſe of intermitting fevers in all countries, does not ſeem ſo indiſputably to poſſeſs the ſame power over the uſual endemic of the Weſt-Indies.</p>
                  <p>Having mentioned the different methods of treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by which it was attempted to procure remiſſion in the endemic fever of Jamaica, and having likewiſe edeavoured to aſcertain how far we can go in prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the return of paroxiſms, it only remains to detail ſome particulars in the management of the plan of cure, where the different ſpecies of fevers were diſtinguiſhed by a peculiar train of ſymptoms. It was obſerved in general, that fevers, with a moderate degree of inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory diatheſis, ſeldom required our interference. The diſeaſe, after a certain duration, terminated uſually of its own accord, After I had gained ſome experience of the general courſe of fevers, I uſually allowed thoſe, in which I did not perceive marks of danger, to go on their own way, that I might better diſcover thoſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods, at which the diſeaſe was naturally diſpoſed to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate. Thus where the paroxiſms continued regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and diſtinct, the remiſſions perfect, and the vigour unimpaired, nothing material was attempted to be done. On the contrary, where the paroxiſms were long, or leſs diſtinctly formed, with ſigns which indicated an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching affection of the nervous ſyſtem, bark, and other remedies, which excited and ſupported the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of life, were given with the earlieſt opportunity. Changes from inflammatory diatheſis to nervous affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were obſerved to happen frequently on the fifth day. Bark, and ſuch remedies as imparted tone and vigour to the ſyſtem, were given without delay; and the diſeaſe terminated for the moſt part on the ninth. In thoſe fevers, which were of a complicated nature,
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:033590_0183_0FF7956EA6344218"/>
in which ſigns of inflammatory, nervous, or putrid dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis were variouſly mixed, bliſters, applied in different manners, opiates, bathing and antiſpaſmodics were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten materially uſeful; but it would be arrogance to attempt to deſcribe rules for the particular mode of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, which muſt vary more or leſs in almoſt every caſe, and which only can be learned from actual obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. There is one rule, however, in the treatment of fevers, of which the practitioner ought never to loſe fight, viz. that wherever it was neceſſary to interfere, it is only the moſt vigorous deciſion which can do good. We cannot, as is ſaid before, depend with certainty upon bark as a remedy poſſeſſed of the power of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely cutting ſhort the cauſe of the fever of Jamaica; yet wherever the fevers of that country diſcovered ſigns of nervous affection, I do not know any thing in the materia medica, from which ſuch beneficial effects may be expected. If it did not actually ſtop the diſeaſe, it was eminently ſerviceable in conducting it to a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able iſſue. Opium, wine, ſnake-root, &amp;c. were often obſerved to heighten its good qualities: but the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular uſe of ſuch additions can only be regulated by cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. Wine has been freely recommended in fevers with ſymptoms of nervous affection; and it muſt be owned, that its good effects were conſiderable, not only in real debility, but wherever the cauſe of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe acted by weakening or depreſſing the powers of life. Wine was likewiſe obſerved to be more uſeful in caſes of mobility and weakneſs, than in caſes of ſtupor and ſuſpenſion of the nervous influence. But though it is actually a remedy of great value, its virtues appear to have been greatly enhanced. In many inſtances it was not proper in any quantity: in ſome, it was only proper in a ſmall quantity, and in very few, perhaps, could we allow of the quantities which are given in common practice. At one time I carried the uſe of wine in the nervous fever of Jamaica, to a very great l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ngth; but I afterwards learnt, that a third part of the quantity would have probably anſwered the purpoſe better. Though it undoubtedly is an uſeful cordial and tonic, it is ſtill inferior to cool air, and particularly to cold bathing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="181" facs="unknown:033590_0184_0FF7957187894688"/>It is an opinion, which ſeems to date its origin from Hippocrates, that bile vitiated in quality, or redundant in quantity, deſerves to be conſidered as the cauſe of the ſpecies of diſeaſe diſtinguiſhed by the name of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent fever: and it muſt be confeſſed, that the frequent appearance of bilious diſcharges, in the fevers of hot climates, gives countenance to the ſuppoſition. From the frequency of this ſymptom, perhaps, the practition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Weſt-Indies adopted the idea, that bile is the cauſe of the fever of that country; while the method of cure, which they uſually purſue, has ſerved to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm them in their error. Prepoſſeſſed with an opinion of the prevalence of bile, they adminiſter cathartics and emetics with a liberal hand. If bile appears in the firſt evacuations, they conſider it ſufficient authority to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed; if it does not appear, they conclude that the remedy has not been of ſufficient force to reach the ſeat of the diſeaſe; and therefore perſiſt in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, till the effect is at laſt produced. It is well known, that a repetition of cathartics and emetics ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom fails to produce the appearances of a bilious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. Hence this ſymptom of fever, and all the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers which follow it, are frequently the work of our own hands. That this is the caſe, appears from a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the method of cure, which I uſually adopted in ſuch fevers as were diſtinguiſhed by ſymptoms of this nature at an early period. Inſtead of encouraging the vomiting, or promoting the evacuation of bile downwards, I generally did every thing in my power to moderate, or even to check it.—Sometimes I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed an emetic; but it was more with a view to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the action of the ſtomach and biliary ſyſtem, than to promote an evacuation of redundant or vitiated hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours. After the operation of vomiting was finiſhed, a bliſter was uſually applied to the region of the liver, and ſuch a plan of cure was purſued, as ſupported a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination to the ſurface of the body, and gave tone and vigour to the ſtomach and general powers of life. By this mode of treatment, bilious appearances vaniſhed ſpeedily, or ceaſed to be troubleſome; while by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated uſe of emetics and cathartics, they generally
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:033590_0185_0FF79573FB403A68"/>
continued long and often prevailed throughout the courſe of the diſeaſe. We may thus, I hope, conclude, without any unnatural inference, that there appears to be danger in encouraging thoſe tumults, which have been uſually conſidered as the efforts of nature. If they are in fact efforts, no perſon can pretend to deny, that they are generally precarious; nay, that they are often the immediate cauſes of death.</p>
                  <p>I have now detailed the particular ſteps of the method of cure, which I adopted in the remitting fever of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica; a diſeaſe which I treated, in ſome reſpects, on a different plan, and, if ſelf-love hath not blinded me, with more ſucceſs than the generality of thoſe practitioners whom I had the opportunity of knowing. I treated the diſeaſe with ſucceſs; but I dare not affirm, as ſome have done, that under this method, of treatment, I never loſt a patient. I proceeded, indeed, with diſſidence and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt of the powers of the medical art; venturing no farther than to ſupport the general powers of life, and to obviate ſymptoms of a fatal tendency. Many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to cut ſhort the courſe of fevers, by the force of a ſingle remedy; but the means do not appear very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, and the effect was often precarious. I grant, that it is ſometimes in the power of the practitioner to exterminate the cauſe of diſeaſe by forcible means, or to deſtroy a certain aptitude of conſtitution, in which this diſeaſe may be ſaid to conſiſt; but I muſt at the ſame time obſerve, that there is danger likewiſe, leaſt he extinguiſhed life. The bark, which has been ſo much celebrated for checking the courſe of fevers, though generally ſafe, was ſeldom effectual: others are frequently dangerous. During the time that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the Weſt-Indies, I obſerved attentively the ſtate of body, which uſually attended recovery; as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe thoſe appearances which preceded, and apparently were the cauſes of death. Tone and vigour, or a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate degree of the ſtate of body diſtinguiſhed by the name of inflammatory diatheſis, without local affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, afforded the ſureſt ſigns of ſafety; general failure of the powers of life, or irregular determinations to organs of importance, were the moſt certain appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:033590_0186_0FF7957750E93170"/>
of danger. Thus, after obviating particular ſymptoms of a fatal tendency, it was the principal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication to ſupport the general powers of life, or to excite the tone and vigour of the ſyſtem. This was beſt accompliſhed by bark, wine, cool air, and above all, by cold bathing, which I am induced to conſider as the moſt important remedy in the cure of the fevers of the Weſt-Indies; and, perhaps, in the cure of the fevers of all hot climates. Though it might not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely cut ſhort the courſe of the diſeaſe; yet it ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom failed to change the fatal tendency of its nature."</p>
                  <p>The experienced LIND informs us, in his 5th edition, that, "When an European is taken ill of a fever (in hot countries) during a ſeaſon of prevailing ſickneſs in thoſe countries, it is neceſſary to endeavour, by the moſt efficacious means, to bring it as ſoon as poſſible to a remiſſion, that the <hi>bark</hi> may be adminiſtered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay.</p>
                  <p>With this view, the phyſician is to conſider how far the violence of the fever in its firſt attack, will admit of bleeding; but he muſt remember that this operation is in general to be uſed with great caution, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of it with ſtill greater in thoſe climates.</p>

               <p>"A fever is a diſeaſe which no knowledge of the ſtructure of the human body, as far as it is at preſent known, no knowledge of the properties of the fluids, as far as they have hitherto been inveſtigated, no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the action of the moving parts, as far as they have hitherto been obſerved, could give the ſmalleſt ground of ſuppoſition, that this diſeaſe could never have exiſted. In ſhowing its hiſtory, therefore, obſervation of the diſeaſe is to be entirely adhered to, without any reaſoning why, or how any thing in it takes place, or without any theory, as it has been called. It would be juſt as fruitleſs, at leaſt for any uſeful purpoſe, as if a geographer were not to deſcribe a country, but reaſon why a hill ſhould be placed in one region, a valley in an other; why one ſhore is rocky, another ſandy; inſtead of actually giving the ſituation of the hills and valleys, the rockyneſs or ſandyneſs of the ſhores.</p>
               <p>A great many more fevers begin between eight in the morning and eight in the evening, than take place between eight in the evening and eight in the morning. There is a remarkable difference; according to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's obſervation, at leaſt ten fevers take place between eight in the morning and eight in the evening, for one that takes place between eight in the evening and eight in the morning.</p>
               <p>It is to be remembered, that the hiſtory of fever ſhould be given as it ariſes from obſervation, and not from any ſuppoſition. It is not therefore pretended to be underſtood, why this difference of proportion ſhould take place. Some have ſuppoſed that the ſun's paſſage over the meridian has an effect, but there does not appear to be any ground for this, becauſe the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of firſt attacks of fever, which take place at noon, or near it, are not remarkably greater than thoſe which
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:033590_0189_0FF7957DA55966C0"/>
take place two or three hours ſooner or later. In ſhort, fever is a diſeaſe, the whole of the appearances of which have been in no ways accounted for.</p>
               <p>It has often been ſuppoſed that the redundancy of bile conſtituted an eſſential part of the attack of fever; whereas it is a mere accident. If the pancreatic juice had been blue, and had any particular taſte or ſmell, and the bile had been colourleſs, inſipid, inodorous, or as much ſo as the pancreatic juice is, in that caſe, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever has been ſaid of the redundancy of bile as en eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial part of the attack of fever, would have been ſaid of the pancreatic juice. It is clear that no experiment hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto made public has ſhown that any bile was ever contained in blood veſſels, excepting in caſe of jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, and that, therefore, there can be no redundancy of bile, excepting as much as can be contained in the biliary ducts, and gall bladder. Much more than this is thrown out by twenty times in the attack of a ſimple fever in half an hour. Therefore, the bile thrown out is a conſequence of the ſickneſs, exactly in the ſame manner as it is a conſequence of the ſickneſs ariſing from the agitation in a ſhip at ſea, and is not at all to be taken farther than as a mere accident in the attack of fever. The loſs of appetite encreaſes, and the nauſea and vomiting take place ſo inſtantly at the beginning of fever, that they can hardly be conceived otherwiſe than as an affection of the ſtomach itſelf.</p>
               <p>All the cauſes, to which fevers can be aſcribed from obſervations, are, certain ſubſtances applied to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as floating in the at<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Indigeſtible food, or other ſubſtances affecting the inteſtinal canal. Sudden riſing of the paſſions of the mind attended with anxiety. But it happens frequently, that fevers ariſe without any of theſe circumſtances having been known to precede them. They are then to be referred to marſh effluvia or to contagious but inviſible matter.</p>
               <p>Of the particular ſecreted fluids which have been thought from their redundancy, or alteration of proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,

to be cauſes of fever, bile has been the moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.</p>
               <p>The ancients, whoſe knowledge of the properties of the matter of the body was very ſuperficial, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended ſolely on the external view, on which hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were founded, ſuppoſed that the fluids conſiſted of red blood, phl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m, bile, and black bile, as is well known to thoſe who have looked into their writings, and that to a redundancy, or alteration of the qualities of theſe, diſeaſes were principally owing, and this idea has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued down to the preſent day. Bile is conſpicuous from its colour and taſte, its colour is varied by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that it meets with in the inteſtines. This dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of appearance has made it be conſidered ſtill of great importance in diſeaſe. But modern enquirers have ſhown that it is a fluid ſecreted only by the liver, is not at all contained in the blood-veſſels, but formed out of the ſubſtances which conſtitute the blood. There cannot, therefore, be any redundancy of bile in the blood-veſſels becauſe generally there is no bile con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in them at all. Bile may, however, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times does get into the blood-veſſels. When it does, being capable of paſſing through all the ſecretory or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, it ſoon ſhows itſelf in all the ſecreted fluids, by giving them a colour, and converting them into a yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low dye, and by tinging all the ſurfaces of the body that are expoſed to the eye, of a yellow colour. When this happens, fever is never known to be produced, or to have followed, or taken place more frequently than in any other ſtate of the body. Bile, therefore, when it does get into the blood-veſſels, never can be accounted a cauſe of fever.</p>
               <p>When the ſecretions of thoſe glands which open in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the inteſtinal canal are increaſed from any cauſe, the ſecretion of bile is increaſed along with that of the pancreatic juice, mucous, &amp;c. When theſe encreaſe conſiderably, they are evacuated upwards or down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Bile being the only conſpicuous one, from its colour and taſte, has often been attended to while the others have been neglected. There is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o evidence that in theſe caſes the liver ſecretes a larger proportion of
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:033590_0191_0FF795828C842D88"/>
bile than the other glands of the inteſtines their fluids. However that may be, apparently there is a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of bile thrown out.</p>
               <p>There is no inſtance upon record, nor none the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ever knew, where fever more frequently took place after ſuch increaſed ſecretion and evacuation than in any other circumſtance. In that ſickneſs, for example, which is produced by the agitation of a ſhip, vaſt quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of bile are often ſecreted, and evacuated, yet there is no inſtance of fever taking place; in conſequence therefore, bile getting into the blood-veſſels, or ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in any quantity, cannot be admitted as a cauſe of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. When ſo much has been ſaid by many authors of great eminence about bilious fever, is their authority to be thrown aſide entirely? Certainly no authority but that which riſes from obſervation and experiment can ever be allowed in true ſcience. It would be great pity to rob patients of their conſolation in being bilious or nervous, but medicine is a ſcience which never can be comprehended without much ſtudy, conſiderably more than can ever be given to it by perſons following other occupations.</p>
               <p>It happens not uncommonly, that there is no criſis takes place after the firſt attack of a fever, but a ſecond attack takes place before the firſt paroxiſm is much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed, ſo that the diſeaſe at firſt puts on the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a continued fever. In this caſe, the ſubſequent attacks are often in the fore part of the day, or if they ſhould come on at the time of the ordinary returns of a continued fever, <hi>which are in the evening,</hi> they obſerve the tertian type; in either of which caſes, we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect in a tertian period or two, firſt an imperfect criſis, followed gradually with more perfect ones, till all the criſes are at laſt complete. When the criſes are very imperfect at firſt, they almoſt always grow gradually more perfect, until it often happens, that they become ſo perfect, as not to leave behind the leaſt veſtige of the diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>In a temperate or cold country, when the patient is ſtrong, and there are only ſlight remiſſions at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of an intermittent, or it puts on the appearance
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:033590_0192_0FF79584660809C8"/>
of a continued fever, excepting that the <hi>exacerbations</hi> do not take place in the <hi>evening,</hi> it is not neceſſary to give great nouriſhment, yet ſome is abſolutely neceſſary. The Greek phyſicians appear plainly not to have allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any food or drink whatever on the firſt days. This ſeems improper, for if no watery fluid were exhibited, the proportion of fluids in the body would probably be too much diminiſhed by the vapour which flies off from the lungs and other external ſurfaces of the body, and by the neceſſary evacuations. Accumulation of ſea ſalt could not take place if neither food nor drink were thrown into the body; but common ſal ammoniac and phoſphoric ammoniac are continually forming by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes which ſeem rather to decompoſe than to produce blood or other fluids, and would be accumulated. Yet theſe might not be detrimental, as water might be form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſame decompoſition, ſo as to render their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions equally dilute.</p>
               <p>Neither the ſolids nor fluids of a living body are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to putrefaction; yet ſome portion of the fluids or ſolids, or both, ſeem to verge ſo near putrefaction, as to be converted into mucilaginous matters which are conſtantly waſhed off by watery ſecretions. Were the quantity of water diminiſhed, they might not be carried off, but go ſtill farther on to putrefaction, producing ſalts and vapours which might be pernicious. On this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it may be neceſſary to throw watery fluids in this caſe of the diſeaſe into the blood-veſſels.</p>
               <p>When the remiſſions and intermiſſions of the fever are very imperfect, or when the diſeaſe at the beginning puts on the appearance of a continued fever, <hi>only that the exacerbations do not take place in the evening,</hi> perhaps it is not neceſſary that much chyle ſhould be formed, becauſe when the intermiſſions become more perfect, there will be time for food of greater nouriſhment to be digeſted, without interfering with the paroxiſms of the diſeaſe; nouriſhment may therefore be out of the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at this time of the diſeaſe.</p>

                  <pb n="190" facs="unknown:033590_0193_0FF77E00AC3A0198"/>"The firſt of theſe is evacuation by <hi>bleeding</hi>; a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful remedy in many diſeaſes, but in a regular tertian intermittent, it has not the leaſt effect in preventing the paroxiſm from taking place, rendering it more regular, inducing more perfect criſis, or rendering the intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions more perfect.</p>
               <p>There ſeems to be a great error in the view of reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies employed in fever; practitioners frequently making no diſtinction between thoſe uſed to cure the diſeaſe itſelf, and thoſe employed to remove accidents that have ariſen in it, although ſuch diſtinctions are extremely neceſſary to be made. If, for example, in the courſe of a tertian, a pleuriſy ſhould happen to ariſe, taking away a quantity of blood would be a powerful remedy for the pleuriſy, but although the pleuriſy were removed, the intermittent tertian would go through its courſe juſt as if no blood had been taken away, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the patient would be rendered weaker.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who are uninformed in medicine expect that diſeaſes are to be cured by violent remedies and ſuddenly. The attention of by-ſtanders is often drawn to practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners who employ ſtrong acrid medicines. This has frequently induced thoſe practitioners who are leaſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the real hiſtory of diſeaſe to uſe the moſt violent medicines in their apparent effects, ſuppoſing that they would alſo be the moſt efficacious in curing the diſeaſe, while practitioners really well informed, find it often much more proper to leave diſeaſes to go through their natural courſe, while they are careful not to let ſlip an opportunity of employing a remedy that is efficacious in carrying them off.</p>
               <p>Purgatives have often been employed in regular ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, with a view to carry off certain humours ſuppoſed to occaſion the diſeaſe. But it has been found on the other hand that purgatives have re-produced the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, after it has been carried off by other remedies, and that excepting in ſo far as they prevent coſtive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the uſe of ſtimulating ones, to aſſiſt the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſudorific remedies, they tend to render the diſeaſe longer in its paroxiſms and the criſes leſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="unknown:033590_0194_0FF77DFE35D7A930"/>Evacuation, either by bleeding or purging, is hurtful, in ſo far as it weakens the patient, and renders him leſs able to bear the repetitions of the paroxiſms, and on this account are improper, although not ſo highly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial as in continued fever, for in the intermiſſions there is time for food to be digeſted, ſo as to repleniſh the blood-veſſels."</p>

               <p>"SEVERAL authors of conſiderable credit, both ancient and modern, have maintained with Dr. Ruſh, that malignant diſtempers are cauſed by the effluvia from corrupted vegetables; and this opinion they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted from a belief, that theſe kind of effluvia, acting as a ferment, produced a putreſcent ſtate in the fluids of the human body. But it appears from experiment, that the vapour of putrefying vegetables, inſtead of being a ſeptic, is a ſtrong antiſeptic matter, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves animal ſubſtances by the fixed air which it contains<note n="*" place="bottom">Alexander's Experimental Enquiry, chap. v.—Dobſon's Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical Commentary on Fixed Air, ſect. v.</note>.</p>
               <p>It has, indeed, been properly remarked, that ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, if not dangerous doctrines have been proclaimed, founded on deductions from ſome of theſe experiments, namely, That, in the time of a prevailing peſtilence, dead animals ſhould be thrown into the ſtreets and roads, to fill the atmoſphere with a putrid ſmell; and that in an epidemic ſeaſon, nothing is better or more ſalutary, than for one to ſmell, three times a day, either a neceſſary-houſe or a ſheep-houſe<note n="†" place="bottom">Alexander's Experimental Enquiry, chap. vii.—Although pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid matter, as Dr. Alexander ſhows, will preſerve other ſubſtances from putrefaction, and although the air proceeding from ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be noxious to the lungs (Prieſtly on Air, vol. 2, p. 254, et ſeq.) yet I do not admit that it is the parent of pure fever.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="192" facs="unknown:033590_0195_0FF7958A24CCD278"/>The effluvium, which exhales from a maſs of putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying vegetables, conſiſts in a mixture of fixed air, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammable air, vital air, and phlogiſticated air. To this mixture of various airs, ſome part of the principles of the plant, namely, the oil and the acid, are ſuperadded; being not totally decompoſed, although the vegetable itſelf be ſo, but merely volatilized by the putrefactive proceſs. Inflammable air abounds in thoſe places where vegetables are rotting in heaps; and marſhes furniſh it in great quantity, from whence it has been character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſed by the name of <hi>marſh inflammable air;</hi> but, in the latter caſe, it is extremely liable to decompoſition, and to paſs into the ſtate of phlogiſticated air<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  </note>.</p>
               <p>This ready decompoſition of inflammable air is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly obſervable in the diminution of common air by phlogiſtic proceſſes, in which a true inflammable air is firſt produced, and in its <hi>naſcent</hi> ſtate, as Prieſtly terms it, is immediately decompoſed, previous to the phlogiſtication of common air—But for the manner in which this is accompliſhed, I muſt refer the reader to Prieſtly's Works on Air, vol. ii. p. 266, and the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding pages; and in the 1ſt vol. p. 127, it is ſhown, that the volatile effluvium emitted from putrefying ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances is phlogiſton, loaded with that matter which contributes to affect the noſtrils with the ſenſe of ſmell. Hence we may conclude, that the exhalations from putrid vegetables, and from marſhes, which may be ſuppoſed to injure the atmoſphere, and extend their influence to any diſtance, conſiſt principally of phlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſticated air.</p>
               <p>Beſides this product of plants in general, certain kinds yield, during putrefaction, a particular ſort of air, of a very foetid ſmell, reſembling the hepatic odour. This ſpecies of vegetables is found to contain ſulphur and volatile alkali, which uniting, form a ſulphureous ammoniacal air, inflammable and highly offenſive;

               <p>The obſervation of Lanciſi, that ſteeped flax and hemp are productive of what he calls a camp-fever, has been copied by many writers as well as Dr. Ruſh. It is an obſervation, however, which ſhould be received with caution. For although the effluvia are extremely offenſive, in this country, where prodigious quantities of flax are watered annually, and in warm weather, I never could trace our fevers to this ſource. The ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoid<note n="†" place="bottom">A remitting fever with nervous ſymptoms.</note> fever, it is true, to which this kingdom is liable, appears to be moſt prone to commence about the ſame time of the year. But the flax-water cannot reaſonably be accuſed of procreating the diſeaſe; becauſe, many years ago, when the culture of flax was little known in Ireland, the fever was obſerved to ariſe about the ſame ſeaſon<note n="‡" place="bottom">Boote's Natural Hiſtory of Ireland, chap. 24. p. 99.</note>.</p>
               <p>In Germany, people ſeem to concern themſelves very little about the danger ſuppoſed to ariſe from the effluvia of ſteeped flax. Nor do I find, as far as I have been able to ſearch on the point, that this kind of effluvia has been charged with generating malignant diſeaſes in Aegypt, a country early noted for its great cultivation of flax, and remarkable for a hot climate. On the contrary, the peſtilential diſeaſes, to which Aegypt is obnoxious, have been imputed to other cauſes, namely, to the annual inundation of the Nile, and the hot winds from the deſerts<note n="§" place="bottom">Is it any wonder that Dr. Lind, was miſtaken in the cauſes of the malignant yellow fever, when he erred ſo egregiouſly reſpecting the cauſe of the plague at Grand Cairo, which he has aſcribed to the conjuct effects of the inundation of the Nile and the hot winds from the deſerts? W. C.</note>.</p>
               <p>As to the celebrated inſtance of putrid cabbages re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by Rogers, by which ſo many writers have ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported their hypotheſes, it ſhould be conſidered, that
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:033590_0197_0FF7958EA46F54E0"/>
when a malignant fever breaks out in a ſeminary, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, or manufactory, the perſons intereſted are at great pains to find out ſome pretence for fixing its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin on another cauſe than that to which it is really due; and generally pitch upon ſomething known <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Another ſource of illuſion is, that in our endeavours to account for epidemical diſorders, we are apt to lay hold of every perceptible difference which we diſcover in the air, or ſituation of places that are attacked, from thoſe that are free; and often, without duly examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and conſidering theſe diverſities, conclude that we have detected the cauſe, which is perhaps involved in inextricable difficulty.</p>
               <p>It does not appear, that in the Weſt-Indies, the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt care in clearing and draining ſwampy grounds, nor the ſetting in of cool winds, will prevent the recurrence of the yellow fever amongſt troops. For we find from Dr. Chiſholm that, although the beſt means were uſed, yet they did not preclude a fever of this kind, which began in Grenada in September, from returning the December following, with a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Theſe are confirmed by other obſervations: We find, from the 9th volume of the Tranſactions of the Bata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian Society, that a fever, which carried off nearly one ſeventh part of the inhabitants, prevailed in Rotterdam, after draining ſome marſhes in the neighbourhood of that city. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

How ſeldom do we hear of them in the neighbourhood of ſlaughter-houſes, or of the work ſhops of ſkinners or curriers?<note n="*" place="bottom">Account of the yellow fever, p. 25, 26.</note>"</p>
               <p>Together with the ſeveral kinds of air which the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations from putrid vegetable matter contains, that from animal putrefaction is compoſed of a ſpecies of alaſtic fluids, called ammoniacal air and ſulphureous ammoniacal air. Theſe airs are imflammable and very foetid; and phlogiſticate the atmoſphere at leaſt equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as the effluvium from vegetable putrefaction. They alſo contain certain volatilized ſubſtances, denominated oily, which modify their influence, according to the nature of the matter from whence they proceed. And although they are active, and emit a conſiderable ſtench, yet I ſo far concur with Dr. Ruſh, that I cannot aſſent to the doctrine of ſome writers, who conceive, that they conſtitute the miaſmata which generate contagious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes. Like putrid vegetable effluvia, I believe they are proper vehicles of contagion; and, therefore, are not principles, but acceſſories only. Or, in the language of the ſyſtematic, to whom Dr. Ruſh ſeems attached, every impurity of air diminiſhes its ſtimulus; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently impure air, or air blended with impure mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, without doubt debilitates, and produces aſthenic diatheſis, which prepares the body for the operation of contagion.</p>
               <p>That ſlaughter-houſes yield a conſiderable quantity of putrid animal effluvium, is certain; eſpecially in places circumſtanced as Cork is, in this kingdom. It is built on iſlands ſituated in a deep valley, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by ſeveral branches of the river Lee. Theſe iſlands were naturally marſhy, and ſubject to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed by ſpring tides, until the ground was raiſed by art. The reſt of the marſhes, both on the eaſt and weſt,
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:033590_0199_0FF7964D228B3360"/>
are periodically covered by thoſe tides; and, in the intervals, putrid vapours are exhaling from them. Continued ridges of hills, on which the ſuburbs are built, bound this vale on the north and ſouth.</p>
               <p>In the north and ſouth ſuburbs, the ſlaughter-houſes are numerous; the blood and odure from which are received in vaſt pits, where they are ſuffered to putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy, and emit ſuch noiſome ſteams as corrupt even the moſt wholeſome breezes that paſs over the city; and, upon great rains, theſe c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſs-pools diſcharge, by the declivities of the hills, their foetid contents into the river. Nor is this ſource of impure air confined to theſe places; for great quantities of filth and offals croud the ſtreets, and particularly the cloſe confined alleys and lanes where that deſcription of people reſide, whoſe circumſtances are peculiarly adapted to foſter and propagate febrile contagion.<note n="*" place="bottom">Rogers on Epidemic Diſeaſes, p. 36, 37.</note>
               </p>
               <p>That we ſeldom hear of fevers being particularly prevalent in the neighbourhood of the work-ſhops of ſkinners and curriers, and, I would add, in that of tan-yards, is not at all ſurpriſing. The proceſſes, which the hides undergo in the hands of the tanner, prevent the putrid fermentation; and, conſequently, the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that kind of effluvium favourable to the action of contagious miaſmata, is primarily oppoſed. The ſmell iſſuing from tan-yards (which by the bye, very much reſembles that from ſteeped flax) however offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, ſeems to be very different from that which is emitted from putrefying animal ſubſtances; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably is owing to principles which do not adequately phlogiſticate the air. If this be the caſe with reſpect to tan-yards, certainly the work-ſhops of thoſe trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſkinners and curriers, who receive the ſkins al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt entirely freed from the corruptible parts, will be ſtill leſs chargeable with being the ſource of contami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating effluvia.</p>
               <p>Several facts tend to prove, that very foul animal effluvia will not excite fever, without the concurrence
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:033590_0200_0FF77E082A6174F0"/>
of ſpecific contagion. Two men travelling on foot in the county of Kent, were aſſaulted near a town on the road with an extremely loathſome ſtench, which they imagined aroſe from animal putrefaction, and which continued to offend them for the ſpace of two hours. The ſky was clear without the leaſt cloud; and, from the direction of the wind, this vapour could neither come from the unwholeſome air of Sheppey iſland, nor from the muddy banks of the river Thames or Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, nor from the Rhumney marſhes. Yet theſe men neither grew ſick at the time, nor experienced any future inconvenience from this foetid exhalation.</p>
               <p>The offenſive ſmell, proceeding even from the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious diſcharges of patients confined with non-fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brile diſeaſes, does not occaſion pure fever. In a bilious colic, the evacuations both upwards and downwards, have been ſo intolerably offenſive, as to produce ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach ſickneſs and retchings in one caſe, and giddineſs, vomiting, and tremor, in another; yet fixed fewer does not appear to have been the conſequence in either.</p>
               <p>Many inſtances have occurred, in which thouſands of dead bodies have been left to putrefy on the field of battle, without cauſing putrid fever; and it is well known, that in no caſe has the origin of this diſeaſe been traced to the effluvia of ſubjects in a diſſecting room. Nor have fevers been obſerved to originate, or to rage more ſeverely, in houſes ſurrounding grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, in the middle of large towns, though the ſtench of the bodies accumulated in ſuch receptacles, is often intolerably offenſive.</p>
               <p>In the caſes which have been brought to ſhew, that infectious effluvia ariſe from putrefying bodies, it does not appear that they produced any ſymptoms reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling thoſe of peſtilential fever; on the contrary, they acted by direct ſtimulus, exciting inflammatory com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints; from which it may be inferred, that they are eſſentially different from febrile contagion.</p>
               <p>I may now fairly conclude, that peſtilential <hi>fever</hi> is not generated by marſh miaſma, by the effluvia from ſtagnant water, nor by the exhalations from putrid vegetable nor animal ſubſtances.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="198" facs="unknown:033590_0201_0FF79593B36E7D18"/>That the yellow fever at Philadelphia did not ariſe from the effluvium of the rotten coffee, is an inference ſtrongly corroborated by the facts and reaſoning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the preceding ſection.</p>
               <p>But that the diſeaſe was really imported from the Weſt-Indies by means of three veſſels, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ion, the malady was of foreign original, could not be actuated, as the Dr. alleges, by mere prejudice.</p>
               <p>Moreover, on the preſumption that the fever was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendered by the effluvia from either vegetable or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imal ſubſtances putrefying upon the wharfs, how are we to explain its appearing in Kenſington, where thoſe miaſmata could not reach undiluted, about the ſame time that Dr. Ruſh was called to viſit Dr. Hodge's child near the ſuppoſed cauſe of infection?—On ſuch a preſumption, the cotemporary viſitation of the diſeaſe in Kenſington and Water-ſtreet is inexplicable. But on the ground of its being imported from the Weſt-Indies, that occurrence may be accounted for in a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory manner, by alleging that ſome of the ſailors, paſſengers, or articles from tainted veſſels made their way to Kenſington very ſoon after their arrival in port. The fact indeed is, that ſome Daniſh ſailors and other perſons, who had been in the neighbourhood of the infected places, carried, the fever to that village; and, that theſe people caught the diſeaſe by contagion, we muſt continue to believe, until we have better reaſons for aſcribing its origin to the damaged coffee, than thoſe we are yet furniſhed with on the affirmative ſide of the queſtion.</p>
               <p>The ſame opinion is entertained by a well-known and juſtly celebrated profeſſor, Dr. Duncan, who is very converſant in medical inquiry, and who writes thus: "Indeed, when we conſider, that it is on all hands allowed, that the diſeaſe after making its appearance, was propagated only by contagion, it ſeems much more probable, that the contagion itſelf was imported, than that it originated in Philadelphia; eſpecially when we reflect, that at the time of its firſt appearance in that city, and for many months before, it had raged with great ſeverity in different Weſt-India iſlands, from whence there were frequent arrivals at Philadelphia."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="200" facs="unknown:033590_0203_0FF79597E6752760"/>Nay, further—In the hiſtories of the yellow fever, furniſhed by the beſt authors, we find included the ſame ſymptoms, as thoſe which Dr. Ruſh accounts cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtic of the diſeaſe<note n="*" place="bottom">The authors here alluded to are, Sir J. Pringle; the two Linds; Dr. Rouppe, whoſe narrative Lind reckons full, clear, and maſterly; Dr. Bruce, who was a native of Barbadoes, and whoſe account is original; Drs.

We find the flow pulſe, called by him the <hi>ſulky,</hi> and by one of his pupils the <hi>undeſcribable</hi> pulſe—we find the indications of determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the head—we find the bilious affections—we find coſtiveneſs—we find childhood not exempt—and we find the peculiar rapidity of progreſs. Can we, then, at all doubt the identity of the Philadelphia fever with that which prevails in the Weſt-Indies?—And if the ſame, why might it not have been imported from theſe iſlands into that city?</p>
               <p>The great difficulty, or in general the impoſſibility, of tracing the contagious ſtream to the particular ſpring from whence it iſſues, has cauſed much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and contrariety of opinion reſpecting the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of infectious effluvia. Dr. Ruſh, for inſtance, imputes the germination of the Philadelphia fever to exhalations from putrid vegetable or animal ſubſtances; whilſt he attributes its ſucceſſive production to the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of contagion. But an infectious, or morbid efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vium, emitted from the living body, muſt contain ſome elementary principle, differing from any compoſing that which ariſes out of dead vegetable or animal mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. This being the caſe, to ſay that miaſma and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion produce one and the ſame diſeaſe, would be ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that two diſſimilar cauſes, acting on the like ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, bring forth a ſimilar effect; which would be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging a phyſical abſurdity.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, as there is good reaſon for ſuppoſing pure fever to be an idiophatic diſeaſe, engendered by its own proper cauſe, which cauſe muſt conſequently be uniform; and, as the epidemic under conſideration is evidently a pure fever; it follows, that it muſt have originated from an infectious <hi>fomes</hi> derived
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:033590_0204_0FF7959A03A44810"/>
from a febrile ſyſtem. A different opinion leads to the diverſification of fevers, which has done infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite miſchief, particularly amongſt the troops in the Weſt-Indies in the laſt war.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Robertſon's Obſervations and Eſſay on Fevers; and Reide on the Diſeaſes of the Army.</note> In this particular, we derive conſiderable ſupport from Dr. Ruſh's book, p. 40; for it is there maintained, that the proximate cauſe of the yellow fever, and of all other fevers, is the ſame. The identity of the proximate cauſe, then, being admitted, fever muſt conſequently be a primary diſeaſe of a ſpecific nature. That the bilious remitting fever, in whatever part of the world it takes place, is radically the ſame, Dr. Gardner thinks manifeſt from numerous obſervations; and Dr. Cullen ſeems confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that in every ſpecies of contagious fever, except the exanthematous, the contagion is eſſentially one matter.<note n="†" place="bottom">Gardner on the Animal economy, ſect. viii. p. 350 and ſeq.— Cullen's firſt lines, vol. i. chap. ii. parag. 83.—And Dr. Ruſh, p. 217, where we find Dr. Stevens, whoſe talents and experience are recorded in the ſame book, affirming that contagion is the native ſource of yellow fever.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Although we can but ſeldom aſcertain the birth place of a ſpreading contagion, yet, as reſearches on this head have been ſometimes ſucceſsful, we may from thence preſume, that zeal and perſeverance, in our ſtate of knowledge, would be attended with farther advantages. With reſpect to the plague, Sennertus avers, that whole families and towns have been infected with it, from the venom which had been pent up in clothes and beds for the ſpace of many years.

               <p>No place is better calculated for diſcovering the ſource and progreſs of contagion, than the navy. An infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious malady can be more ſtrictly traced in fleets, or in a number of different ſhips, than in towns and villages, "as all the ſhips which compoſe a ſquadron, are under the ſame influence of diet and climate, the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the men being likewiſe in other reſpects for the moſt part ſimilar." Hence a contagion may often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin in a ſecret manner, and ſpread itſelf unſuſpected over a town or village; while in a fleet of ſhips its commencement and extenſion become more apparent, from its confinement to one or more veſſels.</p>

Three months after this fever had entirely ceaſed in Haſlar hoſpital, two nurſes, lodging in the ſame chamber, were ſeized with fevers, and both became yellow; one died, the other recovered. By a ſtrict examination, it was diſcovered, that they had concealed ſome ſhirts and clothes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the infected men from America<note n="*" place="bottom">Lind on fevers and infection, p. 2, 23, 36, 7<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>When a nurſe is ſeized, or when two or three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in a family are attacked with a fever, it is imputed ſolely to cold, fatigue, grief, or the like debilitating cauſes; which ſeem to act no otherwiſe, than by ſtrongly diſpoſing the conſtitution to receive and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate the taint. And when ſuch a diſeaſe appears in a boarding-ſchool of boys or girls, the calamity is often aſcribed to cauſes which are not in the leaſt acceſſory. Of this Dr. Lind relates an inſtance; and I have been able, more than once, to trace very virulent contagions to thoſe kind of places.</p>
               <p>As the phlogiſticated ſtate of the air depends upon the ſeparation of one of its conſtituent parts, whereby the remainder becomes capable of keeping ſuſpended the contagious matter; it has been conceived, that, if this ſtate of the air be reſtored to its former purity, by adding to it that portion of which it had been deprived by the pulmonary and cutaneous functions, its powers of elective attraction will be altered, and that which was before held ſuſpended, will now be precipitated. This precipitation of the morbid mephitis (conjectured to be in ſome caſes in the form of powder) being depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited upon certain ſubſtances qualified for receiving it, is ſuppoſed to conſtitute what authors have agreed to call a <hi>fomes.</hi>

Upon viſiting the cells where ſome men were confined with contagious diſeaſes, Mr. Howard's clothes became ſo impregnated with the effluvium, that he was obliged to expoſe himſelf to the open air on horſeback; and the vinegar, to which he was always accuſtomed to ſmell, became likewiſe ſo ſaturated as to be intolerably offenſive<note n="*" place="bottom">Alderſon on contagion, p. 12, 20, 21—Darwin's Zoonomia, ſect. xxxiii, 2, 8.</note>.

The conſequence was, the firſt did not bear the evacuation, his pulſe flagged, and he was very delirious in the enſuing fit. The other

But when a perſon has continued a ſhort time in a warm climate, he pronounces that blood-letting is extremely detrimental.

               <head>CONCLUSION.</head>
               <p>FROM a review of the preceding Obſervations and Abſtracts, it appears, that the remitting or bilious fever as it is commonly called, is only a variety of the intermitting fever, occaſioned by an inviſible matter, (known to exiſt only from its effects) derived from dead vegetable and animal matter, in a ſtate of putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; that it is diſtinguiſhed by an evident remiſſion or abatement, but not a total ſuſpenſion or ceſſation of all the febrile ſymptoms once in the courſe of every twenty-four hours, moſt commonly in the morning, and a renewal and increaſe of the ſame before the evening; differing in this as well as other circumſtances, from the typhus, or continued fever, occaſioned by human contagion, in which there is almoſt always an exacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation or increaſe of the fever later in the evening.— That the nearer it approaches to or reſembles the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting type, the greater is the proſpect of ſafety. That the paroxiſms are prolonged and intermiſſions pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, or rendered imperfect, by two oppoſite cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, viz: by a <hi>phlogiſtic</hi> diatheſis, and by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural <hi>depreſſion of ſtrength.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That this kind of fever is not contagious or commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated from one perſon to another, and that it differs from the malignant yellow fever, not only in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, but in its cauſes, nature and ſymptoms, as well as in the remedies requiſite for its cure; as muſt be ſtrikingly evident to every one that is capable of tracing effects to cauſes and will take the trouble to read the account of its origin and progreſs in Grenada in the year 1793, previous to its appearance in Philadelphia, publiſhed by Dr. Chiſholm, and recollects that it had not made its appearance in Philadelphia for the ſpace of thirty-one years before, though the ſummers had frequently, during that period, been as warm and dry, and ſome of them more ſo, and the ſtreets and wharves
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:033590_0211_0FF795AB22E8B0F8"/>
more replete with putrefying matters, and the air with the additional exhalations from the deep trenches and muddy docks, the receptacles of every kind of filth and impurity, as well as from the ſtagnant water of the ſuburbs and adjacent marſhes, ſources which had neither a local habitation or a name in 1793—And that the fever was occaſioned by foreign contagion laſt ſummer, a committee of the College of Phyſicians has furniſhed the legiſlature of this ſtate with ample and unequivocal evidence.</p>
               <p>It alſo appears from the abſtracts of the opinions and practice of different phyſicians, that no general or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible rule can be eſtabliſhed with regard to blood-letting in remitting fevers derived from marſh miaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata; for we find ſome of the ſame authors that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend this remedy at one period of the diſeaſe or at a particular ſeaſon, condemn it at a different ſeaſon, or at a different period, or in a different ſituation.</p>
               <p>General and indiſcriminate recommendation or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdiction of blood-letting, beſides being inconcluſive, have been too often founded upon ſome favourite but uncertain hypotheſis inſtead of being derived from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations of its effects in different conſtitutions, and under different circumſtances.</p>
               <p>That blood may be drawn when certain circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are preſent in every kind and variety of fever, if not with advantage, yet certainly without injury, no one converſant with medical facts will deny. The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty is to know thoſe circumſtances when they are preſent, and the quantity of blood requiſite to be drawn to produce the greateſt poſſible advantage. Symptoms are the only guides we have to this knowledge; but the ſymptoms which conduct to this knowledge can only be diſtinguiſhed by men of accurate obſervation and extenſive experience.</p>
               <p>Great diverſity of opinion alſo unfortunately exiſts among the phyſicians in the Weſt-Indies, as well as in this country, reſpecting the effects of blood-letting in the malignant yellow fever, owing in a great meaſure I believe to its having been employed, too indiſcriminate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, too laviſhly, too frequently, or at too late a period
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:033590_0212_0FF795ACFB6CC0D8"/>
of the diſeaſe, the nature and progreſs of which had not been ſufficiently attended to. My experience and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations in the year 1793, as well as laſt year, war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant me in affirming, that I found blood-letting not only a ſafe, but an indiſpenſable remedy in every caſe connected with unequivocal ſymptoms of inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſuch as acute pain in the head, ſtomach, or bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, and hard, tenſe, chorded or contracted pulſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it felt ſmall or full, and eſpecially if thoſe ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms continued without very ſenſible abatement more than twelve or fourteen hours.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, I have always obſerved that it increaſed the debility, and accelerated the fatal termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the diſeaſe, in almoſt every caſe which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced with great proſtration of ſtrength, extreme anxiety and oppreſſion and ſenſe of weight about the epigaſtric and hypochondric regions, accompanied with a ſmall, quick, irregular pulſe, little alteration of heat on the ſurface, hurried and interrupted reſpiration, frequent and deep ſighing, dejection of mind and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant reſtleſsneſs, and eſpecially, if thoſe ſymptoms con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued without ſenſible and diſtinct abatement, more than eighteen or twenty-hours.</p>
               <p>I have alſo ſeen blood-letting, when employed in the remiſſions, where the ſymptoms were by no means alarming or unfavourable in appearance, bring on faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and convulſions, and in ſome inſtances, death.</p>
               <p>It can not therefore, be too often repeated, that it requires that judgment which can only be acquired by extenſive experience and attentive obſervation, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a phyſician to diſtinguiſh the circumſtances which require or juſtify the employment of a remedy which ſeldom fails of doing either good or harm.</p>

            <head>Exhibiting a Sketch of Facts and Reflections relative to the malignant Fever, commonly called the Weſt-India Yellow Fever.</head>
            <p>A CONTAGIOUS fever called the Weſt-India yellow fever, has occurred at Philadelphia <hi>ſix times</hi> ſince the firſt ſettlement of the city, viz:—In the years 1699, 1741, 1747, 1762, 1793, and 1797. The ſame kind of fever prevailed in Charleſton, the capital of South-Carolina, in the years 1700, 1732, 17<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, and 1748. A few caſes alſo occurred in the years 1792 and 1794, but it did not become epidemic in the years laſt mentioned. It prevailed in Virginia in the years 1741, 1747, and 1795. At Baltimore, the capital of Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, in 1794. At New-York, in 1743, 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>91, and 1795. At New-Haven, in Connecticut, in the years 1743, and 1794. In the capital of Maſſachuſetts in the year 1796.</p>
            <p>An account of the contagious fever which prevailed in Philadelphia in the year 1699, is contained in the Journal of Thomas Story, Eſq. City Recorder. The mortality was greateſt in September, and ceaſed entirely by the 1ſt of November. Mr. John Gough, in his hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the Society of Friends, (vol. 3d, p. 516) ſays, this fever "was the diſeaſe which has ſince been cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the yellow fever;" and that it had for a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable time before, been very mortal in ſeveral of the Weſt-India iſlands.</p>
            <p>In the year 1741, it is recorded by Dr. Lind, in his 2d paper on infection, that the diſeaſe was introduced by means of a trunk of wearing apparel received from Barbadoes, which had belonged to a gentleman that died of the diſeaſe in that place; and that the diſeaſe ſpread from the family that received the trunk, into the town, and deſtroyed above two hundred of the inhabitants.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="212" facs="unknown:033590_0214_0FF795B2E7B50618"/>A letter from Mr. Lardner, contains an account of its prevalence and mortality in 1747, and adds, that many whoſe buſineſs and families would permit them, fled from the city.</p>
            <p>An account of its prevalence in 1762, has been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the notes of Dr. Redman, and by him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the College of Phyſicians. According to thoſe notes, the diſeaſe was introduced about the latter end of Auguſt, by a mariner, who arrived from the Havanna ill of it, and took lodgings near the New Market, below Pine-ſtreet. The fever that year made but little progreſs above Spruce-ſtreet, but was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined principally to the vicinity of the New Market, and the ſtreets weſt of it; ſpreading gradually from one family to another, till towards the end of September; from which time it gradually declined, and ceaſed entirely about the middle of October.</p>
            <p>In 1793, the diſeaſe made its appearance the latter end of July, in three or four families about the ſame time, in Water-ſtreet, very near to a wharf where a French privateer called the Sans Culotte, with a prize ſhip from Europe, and two ſmall veſſels from a port in Hiſpaniola, lay; one of which landed ſeveral ſick paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers immediately upon her arrival, ſome of whom took lodgings at Richard Denny's, within a very ſhort diſtance from, and directly oppoſite to the wharf where they landed, The firſt victims to the diſeaſe were two of Denny's lodgers, one of which was attended by Drs. Cathrall and Phyſick. Dr. Hodge, preſcribed mercurial purges for three of Mr. Le Maigre's ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants on the 2d of Auguſt, whoſe houſe was one of the neareſt to the infected veſſels. For nearly two weeks the diſeaſe was confined to that neighbourhood, or to perſons that had tranſacted buſineſs, or that had communication with thoſe that were ſick in it. But as the circle of contagion enlarged, the diſeaſe rapidly ſpread through almoſt every part of the city, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed four thouſand and forty-eight perſons before the 10th of November, by which time it entirely ceaſed, having gradually declined from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of froſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="213" facs="unknown:033590_0215_0FF795B4986D2898"/>In 1797, the diſeaſe made its firſt appearance the latter end of July, in the neighbourhood of Mr. Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel's wharf, a few paces below Pine-ſtreet, where three veſſels lay; One of which had been in port all ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, one called the Iris, arrived from Oporto with wine, and took her ſtation at the wharf on the 21ſt of July; and the other called the Arethuſa, from the Havanna, on the 24th. The laſt mentioned veſſel had been employed in tranſporting ſlaves from Jamaica to the Havanna, the latter end of June. The carpenter and one of the mariners died with ſymptoms of the yellow fever on board, during her paſſage, according to the depoſition of Mr. St<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>phen Kingſton, and a letter from Mr. Fitch, two reſpectable merchants, who were paſſengers on board of the Arethuſa to the Havanna. The captain alſo acknowledged to me that a negro boy died on the paſſage from the Havanna to Philadelphia.</p>
            <p>The pilot, James Mulford, was attacked with fever on board the Arethuſa in the night of the 23d. being the laſt of her quarentine near the Marine Hoſpital, and was taken to his lodgings immediately after his arrival in her at the city. I attended him in his diſeaſe, which ſoon unfolded its true nature, and came to a criſis on the 5th day from the attack.</p>
            <p>On the 29th of July, the mate and cook of the brig Iris, the veſſel from Oporto, which lay in contact with the Arethuſa, were attacked with fever: The caſe of the cook, who vomited matter black as ink, and died on the 5th day, was communicated to the College of Phyſicians by Dr. Stewart who attended him. The mate's fever terminated favorably on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Dr. Mitchell, in a letter to Dr. Franklin, in which he deſcribes the ſymptoms of the diſeaſe when it occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in Virginia in 1741, and 1747, aſſerts that "the diſeaſe has chiefly raged in America, in large towns, camps or ſhips, and has been twice brought into Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia by ſhips of war." (p. 2.) Not being ſuſpected to be contagious by the phyſicians of Norfolk in 1795, its origin was not enquired into. I have not been able to procure any certainty reſpecting its origin at Baltimore, in the year 1794; but from its appearing firſt at Fell's P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

About four hundred of the inhabitants of Baltimore were deſtroyed by it. Froſt ſetting in early put a period to its farther ravages.</p>
            <p>Dr. Monſon, in the account which he has given of the yellow fever, at New Haven (Con.) in 1794, ſtates "that in June the inhabitants of that city, were alarmed at the number of ſudden deaths, which had occurred from the 10th to the 20th of the month, and requeſted the ſelect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to make enquiry into the origin of the diſeaſe. On examination it appeared, that in the beginning of June, Capt. Truman arrived from Martinico, in a ſloop that was infected with the contagion of the yellow fever: that this veſſel lay at the <hi>wharf,</hi> within a few rods of Iſaac Gorham's houſe: that ſhe had on board a <hi>cheſt of clothes,</hi> which had belonged to a mariner, who died of the yellow fever, in Martinico; and that his cheſt was carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Mr. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>There were a number of perſons who caught the diſeaſe at Mr. Gorham's houſe, and recovered.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Thomſon, on the firſt day of her illneſs, was moved half a mile from Mr. Gorham,s, into George-ſtreet. Luther Fitch caught the diſeaſe from Mrs. Thomſon, and communicated it to his ſervant maid. Both recovered. Mr. Fitch lives in College-ſtreet, near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly three quarters of a mile diſtant from Mr. Gorham's houſe. I could trace the diſeaſe throughout the town. No perſon had the yellow fever, unleſs in conſequence of attending the ſick, or of being expoſed to nurſes, infected houſes, clothing, or furniture.</p>
            <p>I have inquired of ſeveral aged perſons in this town, relative to the yellow fever, whether they knew of its having ever been here, previous to June 1794, and there is but a ſingle inſtance; the facts relating to which are theſe:—In the year 1743, a tranſient perſon, by the name of Nevins, who came from the Weſt-Indies, lodged at the houſe of Nathaniel Brown, an inn-keeper, in this city. The man was taken very ſick, in the night; and died ſhortly afterwards; and his body was very yellow, after death. Mr. Brown's wife ſickened in a ſhort time, and died, of the ſame complaint; which was, at that time, ſuppoſed to be the yellow fever.</p>

            <p>In the year 1795, the yellow fever made its appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance at New-York about the 20th of July, and ceaſed towards the latter end of October. Between theſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods ſeven hundred and thirty-two of the inhabitants fell victims to the malady, though a great part of the inhabitants had deſerted the city, and the weather, the chief part of the time, was remarkably wet and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately cool, a few days excepted.</p>
            <p>The diſeaſe was traced by the Committee of Health to importation from Port-au-Prince, by the brig Zephir, which left that iſland the 1ſt, and arrived at New-York the 20th of July.</p>
            <p>The firſt victims to the diſeaſe were Dr. Treat, phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician of the port, and ſome Engliſh ſailors on board the ſhip William, which laid near the infected brig. For the proofs of this account, I refer to the report of the New-York Committee of Health, dated Sept. 8th, 1795, and to that of the Philadelphia Board of Health, dated Sept. 17th, publiſhed in the Philadelphia Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zette of Sept. 24th, 1795.</p>
            <p>We know from the publication of Dr. Chiſholm, (entitled an Eſſay on the Peſtilential Fever, introduced into the Weſt-India iſlands from Boulam, on the coaſt of Guinea, in 1793 and 1794) that the yellow fever was epidemic and extremely mortal in the iſland of Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada, and that it had been carried from thence to To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bago and ſeveral other iſlands, ſeveral months before it made its appearance in Philadelphia.</p>

From all which circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, taken ſeparately and collectively, it may with almoſt a convincing degree of certainty be concluded, that it is not derived from marſh miaſmata or the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluvia of putrefying vegetable matter, otherwiſe the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive inhabitants would be equally liable to the diſeaſe with foreigners, as is known to be the caſe with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to intermitting and remitting fevers in marſhy ſituations.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>Deſcription of the Symptoms.</head>
               <p>THE firſt ſymptom in perſons of vigorous conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, was generally an acute pain in the fore part of the head, and a burning ſenſation in the eyes. Theſe ſymptoms were either accompanied with, or immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſucceeded by a chillineſs, or ſenſe of univerſal cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, (but no ſhivering) accompanied with the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruciating pain in the back, knees and legs, hurried and confined reſpiration, oppreſſion and diſtreſſing ſtructure about the epigaſtric region. This chillineſs alternating with tranſient fluſhes of heat, and with paleneſs and redneſs of the face, with great reſtleſſneſs, ſometimes continued from one to ſix or eight hours, and in ſome caſes longer, but in many caſes the violent ſenſe of heat came on in a few minutes without any mixture of cold. This fever was rarely preceded by the ſenſe of debility,
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:033590_0221_0FF795C28EFEE1E8"/>
which almoſt invariably precedes intermitting and remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting fevers. The ſtomach was frequently affected with ſickneſs and retchings to puke during the continuance of the chillineſs, but ſeldom afterwards for the firſt two days, excepting in thoſe caſes in which the ſtomach ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be affected with inflammation from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as was ſometimes obſerved. When this was the caſe, the ſtomach always felt ſore and painful upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſſed by the hand. The patient was alſo, always either coſtive, or affected with dyſentric ſymptoms ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a burning ſenſation in the bowels, till the diſeaſe came to a criſis, or at leaſt till an evident remiſſion took place. And when ſtools were produced by art, they appeared white reſembling thoſe of perſons with the jaundice, owing, as appears from various diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſections, to an obſtruction to the excretion of bile from an inflammatory affection of the ducts which lead from the liver to the duodenum.</p>
               <p>Though in caſes that terminated favourably, there was generally a diminution of the violence of the fever every morning, there was ſeldom a remiſſion before the third day, and in many caſes not before the fifth. When a remiſſion did take place, it was generally accompanied with a copious diſcharge by the bowels deeply coloured with bile, and ſoon after with a general perſpiration or a copious ſlow of urine. In ſome caſes a ſolution of the diſeaſe was accompanied with, or preceded by a cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lera.</p>
               <p>The pulſe after the ceſſation of the chillineſs, was generally quick and tenſe, and in ſome caſes full and throbbing, eſpecially towards the middle of the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, at which time the ſurface of the body was alſo more intenſely hot and dry, and the thirſt increaſed. The tongue always white and moiſt for the two firſt days, afterwards it varied in appearance, from a light, to a dark brown, &amp;c. The eyes were generally inflamed and watery at firſt; this appearance increaſed decreaſed with the fever. In many caſes either a coma, or a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual inclination to vomit accompanied with a pain at ſtomach, intolerable anxiety, and frequent and deep ſighing came on at the end of the third or beginning of
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:033590_0222_0FF795C5211D18B8"/>
the fourth day, and ſometimes later; in the former caſe the pulſe appeared to differ but little from a ſtate of health, though ſometimes it was very low and ſmall, ſeldom ſo ſlow and full as that which ariſes from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the brain. In this case, unleſs ſpeedy relief was obtained, the limbs became cold, and blood iſſued in ſtreams from the noſtrils, and often from the gums and inteſtines, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In the moſt dangerous caſes, if comatoſe ſymptoms did not ſupervene an inceſſant puking came on, and every thing was caſt up the inſtant it reached the ſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach, and the patient conſtantly complained of a burning and painful heat in that organ. A yellowneſs of the eyes generally made its appearance immediately after the commencement of the puking, and if the puking continued with violent and ineffectual ſtrainings, the yellowneſs ſpeedily diffuſed itſelf over the whole body. The pulſe under theſe circumſtances was always ſmall and low, but generally chorded, tenſe, or hard. When the cauſe of this puking was not ſpeedily removed, a ſphacelus of the ſurface of the ſtomach took place, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from diſſections, and a mixture was thrown up, at firſt flaky and of the colour of coffee grounds, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of a blacker colour and thicker conſiſtence, reſem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bling a mixture of ſoot and water. As ſoon as the black matter began to come up, every ſeveriſh ſymptom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſubſided, except a ſlight alienation of reaſon, and a want of recollection, and the patient believed himſelf to be perfectly well: a cadaverous coldneſs now pervaded the limbs, the fair became livid and bloated, and the patient ſoon ſunk into the arms of death.</p>
               <p>When the diſeaſe terminated favourably, it was moſtly on the 3d, 5th or 7th day. When the reverſe, it was on the 4th, 6th or 8th day. Convulſions fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently cloſed the ſcene. Subſultus tendinum never occured, when the diſeaſe terminated within eight days.</p>
               <p>In many perſons the diſeaſe affected the nervous ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, more than the arterial; in theſe caſes, the febrile ſymptoms ſeldom run high, and the diſeaſe was longer protracted—longer in coming to a criſis.—In ſome caſes
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:033590_0223_0FF795C6C0E64920"/>
the ſymptoms of debility and malignity, were great and alarming from the beginning.—In theſe caſes the diſeaſe almoſt always proved mortal.</p>

               <head>Treatment.</head>
               <p>MY experience both in 1793 and 1797, convince me that blood-letting is not only beneficial to a certain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, but is abſolutely neceſſary in every caſe where the pain in the head is conſiderable, and the pulſe quick and tenſe, and the ſkin hot; and alſo when the ſtomach is affected with a painful burning ſenſation, or feels ſore upon preſſure, eſpecially if accompanied with pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and pain upon taking any mild liquid into it. Whereas it invariably does injury in every caſe where the proſtration of ſtrength is great and ſudden, the pulſe low, weak, and irregular, the limbs colder than in health, countenance ſhrunk, pale, livid and dejected, accompanied with great oppreſſion, weight and ſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture about the epigaſtric and hypochondric regions, quick, uneaſy reſpiration, with anxiety, reſtleſsneſs, and frequent ſighing. In two caſes a ſecond bleeding ſunk evidently the vital powers, and certainly did harm, as the mercurial powders alſo did in another caſe.</p>
               <p>In the year 1793, I certainly found bleeding bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial in more than two thirds of the caſes that I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended after the 20th of September, (and I frequently viſited more than a hundred in a day at that time) for the majority of the caſes that year began, as well as the laſt year, with inflammatory ſymptoms; and it is well known to phyſicians and hiſtorians, that bleeding is a ſafe and often an uſeful remedy in every diſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of diſeaſe in which inflammatory ſymptoms pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominate, not excepting the plague, which appears to be merely a higher grade of the yellow fever.</p>
               <p>It is the abuſe, the exceſs, or the miſtimed applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of blood-letting, that ſhould be rejected in the yellow fever, and not its judicious and moderate ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="222" facs="unknown:033590_0224_0FF795C9A3EE5D40"/>I am therefore, under theſe reſtrictions, an advocate for it in the early ſtage of the yellow fever, in every caſe where inflammatory ſymptoms predominate; and am of opinion that it may be repeated with advantage once a-day, or oftener, ſo long as thoſe ſymptoms con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, at any period, and in every ſtage of the diſeaſe; notwithſtanding what has been ſaid to the contrary by the ſlaves of theory in the Weſt-India iſlands, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly by Dr. Todd, of Jamaica. I however, by no means, approve of the practice of thoſe who bleed <hi>profuſely</hi> and indiſcriminately in all caſes in a ſever that is frequently attended with great loſs of ſtrength, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of mind, and putrid tendency. But to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn bleeding, and withhold it in all caſes indiſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minately, argues not only want of experience, obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of reflection, but of common ſenſe.</p>
               <p>It is evident, however indirectly it may be marked by the ſymptoms, that an inflammatory affection very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently exiſts in ſome part more than another, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in the ſtomach, peculiar, in this reſpect, that its tendency to terminate in gangrene, as appears from numerous diſſections, is infinitely greater in this diſeaſe than in any other that has ever appeared in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. It is no leſs evident, that this ſtage, when violent, is almoſt conſtantly ſucceeded by a diatheſis, or ſtate of a putreſcent nature, unleſs prevented by evacuating remedies early applied, and the ſtrict obſervance of the antiphlogiſtic regimen.</p>
               <p>From theſe circumſtances, no man attentive to the ſuggeſtions of reaſon, would venture to draw off a very large quantity of blood at the firſt operation, leſt it ſhould induce too ſudden debility, and thereby prevent the vital powers from counteracting the putreſcent tendency of the diſeaſe; which is always the caſe when the debility is great, as on the other hand, the premature uſe of c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rdials and ſtimulating medicines inevitably increaſe the tendency of the exiſting inflammation, to terminate in gangrene. I have ſeen many inſtances of both theſe fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

climate; eſpecially as it aſſumes a variety of different aſpects according to the conſtitution of the patient, and the treatment he receives, which occaſions an embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſment that nothing can remove, but a habit of nice diſcernment, a quickneſs of apprehenſion, which enables a phyſician to perceive real analogies, and a correct judgment, which ſecures him from being miſled by imaginary ones.</p>
               <p>Dr. Chiſholm's method of uſing mercury in the malignant fever when it appeared at Grenada in 1794, was, "to give ten grains to an adult as ſoon as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, after ſeeing him, at every period, and under every circumſtance of the diſeaſe, this he aſſures us, generally acted as an aperient in the degree required, about an hour or two after it was given.—At the end of three hours he repeated the ſame doſe without opium, if the firſt had not purged more than twice. At the end of three hours more the ſame quantity was given, adding opium, or not, as the preceding doſes had acted. In this manner ten grs. were given every three hours, till the ſalvary glands became affected, which generally happened in leſs than twenty-four hours from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of the treatment. Signs of returning health immediately ſucceeded the appearance of ſalivation, and returning health was remarkably rapid." (See his Eſſay, p. 272.)</p>
               <p>With the few caſes that I have ventured to adopt this treatment, it has not ſucceeded with the ſame certainty as the Diſcoverer's aſſurances gave me reaſon to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect—Yet in caſes where the ſymptoms appear to be of a nervous kind early in the diſeaſe, inſtead of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory, and not accompanied with thoſe of a putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent, or malignant appearance, perhaps it is prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to any other, when given in ſmall and repeated doſes; obſerving always to reſtrain it from occaſioning too copious evacuations, by the occaſional addition of opium, or by employing it externally<note n="*" place="bottom">When the debility is very great, or after the acceſſion of black vomiting mercury makes no impreſſion, as the lymphatics loſe their power of abſorption</note>. But in all caſes
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:033590_0226_0FF795CE80741E90"/>
in which inflammatory ſymptoms predominate, I am certain that the moſt ſucceſsful method of treating the diſeaſe, is by bleeding and free purging, till thoſe ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms are ſubdued.</p>

                     <p>"THAT your memorialiſts, deeply affected with the calamities produced by the diſeaſe which has recently occurred amongſt us, are impelled by a ſenſe of duty to their fellow-citizens and themſelves, to inform you, that they conſider the laws which were enacted for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of preſerving this city from malignant contagious diſorders, are very imperfect.</p>
                     <p>The ſubject being of immenſe importance, they hope to be excuſed for ſtating their ſentiments with reſpect to it at large.</p>
                     <p>They are of opinion that the diſeaſe which produced ſo much mortality and diſtreſs in the year 1793, was imported into this city from the Weſt Indies; and they
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:033590_0227_0FF795D0212DF520"/>
are confirmed in this ſentiment, by the circumſtances attending the diſeaſe of this year, which they conſider as of the ſame nature and derived from the ſame ſource.</p>
                     <p>Some of their moſt important reaſons for this opinion are as follow:—The diſeaſe in queſtion is eſſentially different from the fevers that occur in this climate, and which originate from domeſtic cauſes. This differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence particularly regards the general progreſs of the ſymptoms, and the mortality, as is evident upon a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of its hiſtory with that of the ordinary diſeaſes of this city.</p>
                     <p>A diſeaſe which reſembles the fever of 1793 and of this year in many important points, has long been known in the Weſt Indies, and thoſe parts of America ſituated between the tropics, and in ſeven or ei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ht different in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, in which a ſimilar diſeaſe has occurred in the United States, in the courſe of this century, there is good reaſon to believe that it was derived from thoſe countries. In moſt of the inſtances, the original hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the diſeaſe contains the information that it was imported. In ſome caſes, the infection can be traced to the imported clothing of perſons who died in the Weſt Indies. In moſt of the caſes where the importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot be aſcertained, the firſt appearance of the diſeaſe has been, as in the other inſtances, in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of the ſhipping, or among perſons connected with veſſels.</p>
                     <p>The circumſtances has attending the fever of this year are extremely in point; and the narrative which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies this, will we truſt, ſatisfy you that it was imported.</p>
                     <p>The diſeaſe in queſtion commenced invariably in our ſeaports, while inland towns, equally expoſed to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary cauſes of fever, have eſcaped; and in the two laſt inſtances of its occurrence in Philadelphia, the ſuburbs and the country adjacent, were more healthy than uſual at the ſame ſeaſon; and at the commencement of the diſeaſe, all the parts of the city, excepting the ſmall ſpaces to which it was confined, were remarkably healthy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="226" facs="unknown:033590_0228_0FF795D2AB23D6A8"/>It exiſts in the Weſt Indies, particularly in time of war, when great numbers of ſtrangers are to be found there; and reference to dates will ſhew, that in moſt of the inſtances of the occurrence of the diſeaſe in the United States, there has been war in the Weſt-Indies.</p>
                     <p>Your memorialiſts are aware, that caſes may be adduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed where the diſeaſe has occurred in perſons who were not known to have been expoſed to imported contagion; but ſuch is the ſubtile nature of this power, that it often exiſts unſuſpected; and ſimilar difficulties occur re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the ſmall pox, and other contagions, allowed by all to be of foreign origin. There alſo occur, although very rarely, ſolitary caſes of malignant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting fevers, the ſymptoms of which reſemble ſo much the diſeaſe in queſtion, that they are often ſuppoſed to be the ſame; but there is this eſſential difference, that a malignant remittent fever has never been, to our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, contagious in this climate.</p>
                     <p>The difference of ſentiment among phyſicians, now ſo much regretted, reſembles that which almoſt always takes place, when the plague is introduced into any of the civilized parts of Europe, where it is not well known. The identity of the diſeaſe, its origin and its contagious nature, have been often the ſubject of controverſy. Some phyſicians have conſidered it as of domeſtic origin; but proper health-laws, ſtrictly enforced, have latterly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected the commercial parts of Europe from its ravages.</p>
                     <p>With theſe ſentiments of the nature of the diſeaſe, your memorialiſts cannot but regard a proper law reſpecting the ſubject, as a matter of the greateſt importance, and although they are perfectly ſenſible of the imperfection of the ſcience of medicine, yet from a conviction that phyſicians are the beſt informed, as well as the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in the ſubject, they approach you with that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect which is due to your Legiſlative authority, and declare their belief, that the exiſting health-laws of this commonwealth are not ſuch as are beſt calculated to obtain the deſired end, and that they ought to be improved.</p>
                     <p>Having lately communicated in writing to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, their ideas reſpecting the beſt methods of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting

the introduction of contagious diſeaſes, they beg leave to refer you to that communication. At the ſame time they tender your their profeſſional aſſiſtance in framing an efficient law for this purpoſe; and thus having performed their duty, they hold themſelves diſcharged from all reſponſibility, on account of the evils which may ariſe from the preſent imperfect ſtate of the Legiſlative arrangements reſpecting this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſubject.</p>

               <p>TO the above Memorial I ſhall only add, that to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, the yellow fever which is as contagious and nearly as malignant as the peſtilence in its worſt form, "is only a higher grade of the remitting or bilious fever from marſh or putrid vegetable effluvia," requires that credulity which never reflects; and to aſcribe the difference in the effects of the ſame cauſe, to a revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution in the conſtitution of the atmoſphere, is a doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine too unphiloſophical and viſionary to be embraced by any but viſionary people; eſpecially, as no experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have been made to prove that any ſuch revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the atmoſphere has taken place; the contrary of which appears to be the fact, from the diſeaſe being confined to cities and cloſe unventilated ſituations, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of marſhy tracts, which are the only ſituations in which intermittents and remittents, ever become epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic.</p>
