            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <head>PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>THE neceſſity of reformation in the modern ſyſtem of novels, is obvious to every reader of taſte and judgment.—The general plan upon which events are founded to carry on a train of incidents in modern compoſition, is not the repreſentation of nature, in ſhowing things as they occur in human life;—but an artificial colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to pleaſe the imagination at the expenſe of common ſenſe and reaſon;—by portraying, in an extravagant manner, the hero or heroine of the narrative, to be all perfection;—paſſing thro' the ſcenes of action with ſuch eclat, that ſimple nature has nothing to do in the romantic exploits that are performed;—ſacrificing at all hazards the complexion of truth, probability, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, to preſerve the favourite of the narrative from all terreſtrial misfortunes; precluding the cruſh of accidents, the invaſion of diſtempers, and the horrors of death!—Thus finiſhing the piece egregiouſly daubed,—and varniſhed roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically extravagant and outré.</p>
                  <p>The plan laid down in the following narrative is quite counter to the foregoing method, being a faithful tranſcript from the volume of human nature;—wherein hyberbole is utterly excluded, and regular delineations are attempted, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance vice and reward virtue.—Yet to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:022876_0003_0FBA98E2BAECD6C0"/>
the latter, the fenced field of probability is not overſtept;—but a continued view of it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved throughout the performance.—The co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring is without elaborate art or ſlovenly care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſs,—for either of them are diſguſting:— ſo that no character is introduced that performs a part either above or below the regulated ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of nature.</p>
                  <p>In this work the reader may find ſome digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which are intended to ſerve ſuch ends as ſecure a pardon for the liberty;—for rational in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction is the ſole aim of ſuch deviations from the uſual method of narration.</p>
                  <p>The ſtyle will perhaps be found on a different plan to that uſed by noveliſts,—but an elevation is attempted:—yet the common place adoption of egotiſm is exploded:—this compoſition being chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſigned for the uſe of the fair ſex, to give them a taſte for the ſtudy of ſcience, ſo far as the cauſe of virtue, morality, and religion will permit.</p>
                  <p>Many objections may be made to the innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by this plan, but every perſon of rational endowments will coincide in the opinion of that excellent genius, Shakeſpeare, who obſerves, "That in many privileged practices, they would be better in the breach than the performance or obſervance."</p>

                  <head>THE SCHOOL OF VIRTUE.</head>
                  <p>IN the delightful County of Devon lived Sir William Howard, a Baronet of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed abilities; whoſe ſentiments in the grand council of the nation were on ſeveral occaſions applauded by every member, who, like him, wiſhed for the proſperity of his country, before that of degrading ſelf-inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt;—poſſeſſing at once the real and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common titles of patriotiſm and honeſty:— for then, as well as at this time, theſe two epithets bore a different ſignification.—But leſt my fair readers ſhould ſuppoſe I mean to deſcant on the theory or practice of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litics, I ſhall at once drop the digreſſion, and proceed.</p>
                  <p>Sir William's houſe was an ancient Gothic ſtructure, not raiſed by lofty towers or tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:022876_0005_0FBA98E56052C7C0"/>
not the gaudy uplifted tinſelled fronts of modern piles, as the manſions of many of our new created families of faſhion are,— but in a more noble ſtyle, tho' not overlook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reſidence of humbler life, only in the front, an unobſtructed view of the ſea ſhore for many miles, in ſerene weather, might be enjoyed; adding an unlimited proſpect of the ſea, which in a calm clear day was only to be loſt in the ſenſible hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon of ſight, which of an evening at the ſetting of the glorious luminary of light and heat, ſeemed not only beautiful in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme, but an awful emblem of ſolemn thought; for who could look on the unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralleled colouring of the glaſſy deep, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out contemplating on the Supreme Being, who out of nothing, ſuch great and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful elements created?—Here it was that the worthy Baronet, at the cloſe of day, ſpent many edifying and ſatisfactory hours, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he digeſted a happy theory into real practice;—conſidering wiſely, for what end he was ſent into a probationary ſtate as a free agent, whereby the choice of life or death were given.—Nor did the early dawn riſe from her grey mottled pillow, without the Knight's viſit to the ſeat of his well earned wiſdom, for ere the golden mantle, embroidered with precious gems of the bluſhing morn was perceived, the pious man had invoked the protection and direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Beneficent Being, to whom he
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:022876_0006_0FBA98E6E654FD00"/>
owed the whole of his happineſs and afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; ſo that with the riſing Planet of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he was ready for an audience,—which was never refuſed to the meaneſt who ſtood in need of his advice, aſſiſtance, or relief: for his doors were open to his friends, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, the traveller, the indigent, or oppreſſed. Thus was humanity made a regular and unerring ſyſtem,—philoſophy only refined the impreſſions, ſo that the beautiful ſublimity of Religion was the true finiſher of Sir William's works,—never daring to attempt any thing that would not admit the touchſtone of that exalted ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,—ſhe always being ranked the criterion of order.—So far let me ſketch the outlines of this truly good and worthy character;— for envy ſhrunk at his preſence, nor dared calumny to ſpread her baleful exhalations where his name was mentioned,—for Fame (for once) had ſounded with ſolid grounds the worth of Howard's name—in proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the daily exerciſe at Howard's Caſtle, ſuch being the name his manſion bore.</p>
                  <p>Sir William's domeſtics were not nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, having only thoſe who were fit to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute with faithfulneſs his daily commiſſions; to diſtribute not only at Howard's Caſtle, but alſo at the reſpective reſidence of the afflicted or diſtreſſed, who had, by proper application, made known their caſes,— therefore the profligate, the idler, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane were excluded. Three male ſervants,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:022876_0007_0FBA98E852A31E40"/>
with two females, compoſed the whole of his family. His Lady, who had for many years ſhared with him the bleſſings of the poor, was ſome time ſince departed from a tranſitory ſtate, to enjoy the everlaſting crown laid up for her, and all thoſe who piouſly follow her in the paths of virtue and chriſtian piety. But ere they parted, had given repeated pledges of their love, which the Deity, for his wiſe ends, had as oft called hence to celeſtial happineſs; yet did not wholly decline the grant ardently wiſhed in their mutual prayers—for an heir was left to perpetuate the worthy name aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed in that illuſtrious family.—Henry was his name, who was now in habits of general cuſtom, making a grand tour of Europe, in order to finiſh an education which had been liberal indeed;—for early had his parents inſtilled the ſeeds of virtue, morality, and religion into his mind, which was well capacitated to receive the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, being naturally ſtrong and very ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſceptible of implanting on a large ſcale the greateſt depths of underſtanding; whereby expanded ideas could reach the greateſt heights, whilſt extenſion was unlimited. Since this period, proper preceptors, with the aſſiſtance of an univerſity, had finiſhed what the Britiſh Iſland could afford in the grand reſearches of knowledge, to be of real ſervice in the rugged road through life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="5" facs="unknown:022876_0008_0FBA98EBCDA12E78"/>Henry was now arrived at an age of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, having attained his twenty-ſecond year; for though his ſtudies were partly finiſhed before that period, yet his father, wiſely conſidering the danger of evil im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, and the conſequences of bad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples—digreſſionally made applications of all the various courſes continental travellers or reſidents uſually practiſed, and the reſult of corrupted minds, faithfully pourtraying the uſe that might be deduced from a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of men and manners in other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; at the ſame time, by an eaſy aſcent, mounting his ideas above the meridian of modern taſte, ſo far as the ſlaviſh habits of imitation in dreſs, gambling, or exceſs in pleaſures of a ſenſual complexion;—wiſely remarking to his ſon, the many amateurs in ſcience, and the few who poſſeſſed real ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents which would argue the name of merit. Thus comparatively oppoſing the advantages and diſadvantages of the uſual method of finiſhing a polite education in travelling— to ſee the manners and cuſtoms of the moſt enlightened and truly poliſhed courts of Europe,—a practice really worthy of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, and of real utility to form the mind, ſo far as liberality of ſentiment, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to religion, a pure taſte for improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in arts and ſciences, with obſervations in the real practice of reading men, to be able to point out the general propenſity, whether good or evil, of the various nations
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:022876_0009_0FBA98ECDFE8B380"/>
when contraſted, ſo as to carry thither no prejudice, nor to bring from thence the leaſt colouring of a depraved taſte; but to go out a man of caution, and return a man of experience; refined by a true notion of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, honor and liberality. Thoſe were the ſhort contents of Sir William's repeated leſſons to his ſon, previous to his ſetting out on his travels; which were liſtened to with dutiful attention, and carefully retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for practical uſes.—Being thus provided with neceſſary inſtruction, a competent knowledge of the acquiſitions that he was to obtain, the dangers he was to avoid, and aſſiſted by the counſel and tuition of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable gentleman in holy orders, as his preceptor, we ſhall not heſitate to proclaim, that great were the expectations of Sir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam, from the conſequent poliſh his ſon ſhould acquire by two or three years reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on the continent.</p>
                  <p>Henry had now been abſent nearly three years, without any extraordinary occurrence, except his intelligence and deſcription of the ſeveral towns, cities, and countries he viſited, all of which were, with a preciſion peculiar to himſelf, narrated with a ſtrict ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to truth; yet in ſo animated and chaſte a method, with an elegance of ſtyle, that gave repetitions of pleaſure to Sir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam, to find his labour well beſtowed in the cultivation of his ſon's morals,—that aſſured him alone, that he would be an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:022876_0010_0FBA98EE53B12EF8"/>
to the ſphere he was likely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve in; as integrity of heart, uſually termed (by the higher ranks of life) honor, was a principle, poſſeſſed without a ſpot or blemiſh by his ſon, which Sir William carefully reminded him to regard as a jewel of ineſtimable value.</p>
                  <p>The exigency of ſtate was now on the eve of calling Sir William to attend his duty in Parliament, when Henry wrote to his father; he wiſhed to know his pleaſure relative to his return to England, expreſſing a deſire to ſee him, and to receive further uſeful leſſons in practical knowledge, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeen a ſufficiency of human life, few of the maxims whereof he choſe to adopt, preferring the manly cuſtoms and liberal ſentiments of Britain, to all thoſe of the Continent. To this requeſt Sir William immediately attended, and in reply to his ſon's letter gave him to underſtand, he ſhould be glad of his return; as his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were to vacate his ſeat in the Houſe, wiſhing to decline in favour of him.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt the period of this interval was paſſing over, Sir William amuſed himſelf with the happineſs of ſeeing his accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſon return in a few days.</p>
                  <p>One evening, in the month of September, nearly about the autumnal equinox, when the ſun is ſuppoſed to enter the firſt ſcruple of Libra, or the Balance, which makes equal day and night in every quarter of the globe,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:022876_0011_0FBA98F1728482A8"/>
and conſequently riſe ſudden ſqualls of wind, therefore a dangerous ſeaſon for ſhips in narrow ſeas;—about the ſetting of the ſun, Sir William, from the leaden terrace of his manſion, eſpied ſomething of the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a ſail, (a word uſed as a ſea-phraſe on a ſight of a ſhip at ſea) however the ſudden change of the approaching night brought on an unuſual darkneſs, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with an awful ſky, overcaſt with clouds of foreboding danger; the winds ſounded hollow, and ſeemingly mourned the fate of victims decreed to an untimely viſitation; whilſt the waves in ſadneſs ſeemed diſturbed by the gathering of vivid flaſhes of lightning, that ſeemed alſo determined to be active in the approaching ſcene.—Quickly the diſtant view of the veſſel was interrupted; the face of nature ſeemed all at once hid beneath the towering clouds, which like fleeces over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrapt each other.—Now was Sir William's conjectures rouſed; his mind was agitated exceedingly; in vain were his endeavours to calm the tumult of aſſembled paſſions; reaſon, fortitude, and all the auxiliary ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacing of reſignation barely afforded relief, ſo great was his anxiety;—for probability ſeemed ſo nearly allied to truth, that his powers were almoſt duped into a belief, that the ſhip juſt now in ſight, was freighted with the ſafe conveyance of his ſon and his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants; here he immediately checked his groundleſs ſuſpicions, by a ſucceſſion of

ideas that cleared up the gloomineſs of his imagination.—"What," ſaid he, "ſhall I doubt of the providence of God, whoſe hand has hitherto been ſtretched forth to guard me from misfortunes? forbid it hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven!—but I am a ſon of frailty, yet I hope my fall ſhall be to riſe again, therefore let the will of Heaven be fulfilled." A ſhort ejaculatory prayer to the Divine Being cloſed Sir William's ſoliloquy. He then haſted from the terrace, the elements beginning their emulative ſtrife. Rain poured down in torrents,—lightning flaſhed in liquid ſheets,—the winds howled in hoarſe bellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, accompanied with dreadful claps of thunder:—thus a hurricane ſet in.</p>
                  <p>Calmneſs nevertheleſs ſat now triumphant on Sir William's brow, though an innate principle of ſomething more than ordinary, filled at intervals the ſcope of his imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>At an advanced hour of night, Sir Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am ordered his domeſtics to retire to reſt, yet from him ſleep had fled; and ſo much the ocean gained upon his thoughts, that he ſat direct in view of the boiſterous ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; carefully watching each ſucceeding wave that ſurfed on the adjacent beach.— 'Twas now about the laſt hour of night, the clock having recently ſtruck twelve, the ſky ſeemed more clear,—the ſable face had part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſappeared, though the winds were ſtill more ſtrong, and had ſet to the ſouth weſt
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:022876_0013_0FBA98F521117058"/>
point,—a pale yellow had butted the riſing of the blaſt,—the ſtorm was completely ſet; at this juncture the Knight perceived the ebbing ſurf of more than common ſize had left behind ſomething of the appearance of trunks or cheſts of baggage!—forthwith he rung his alarm bell, his ſervants inſtantly attended, but ſcarce were they collected, before a ſecond appearance of a wreck was ſeen, from whence proceeded a lamentable cry of diſtreſs in the extreme.—This was more than Sir William's breaſt could ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain,—he ruſhed forth in frantic ſtrides, beckoning the inſtant attendance of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtics, which was obeyed implicitly,—a few minutes opened the ſcene, and revealed a ſight more than can be deſcribed in the ſadneſs of repreſentation:—Several mangled bodies thrown from the wreck,—others in pitiable efforts endeavouring to eſcape, whilſt the yawning deep enveloped her prey!—In vain did the good Knight exert all his ability;—to conteſt with winds and waves was more than he dared, deſpair had invaded the thoughts of thoſe who were minded to give relief,—the ſight was too piercing a ſpectacle, where no alleviation could take place,—the whole crew were ſeen to ſink beneath the briny ſurface!—Here Sir William broke ſilence, "Alas! what avails our boaſted ſtrength, our greateſt power, our moſt uſeful faculties?—nothing! when Heaven's high will oppoſes our inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:022876_0014_0FBA98F6CE52FA18"/>
—Though human creatures are in the greateſt need of timely aid at ſome few yards diſtance, yet we cannot afford the ſmalleſt relief."—Juſt now ſunk the laſt victim to the mercileſs waves!—"ſee the havock!—ſee the wretched appearance of lifeleſs mortals! behold the mangled limbs of both ſexes!—but ſee what this laſt ebb has left?—a woman's body!—yes!—no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion,—perhaps not quite dead;—ſhe was the laſt the mighty flood was ſatiated with,— hither bear the corps,—if returning life ſhould animate the body, then are all our cares happily beſtowed."</p>
                  <p>Thus ended the good man's reverie. —He haſted to his houſe to adminiſter all that humanity could dictate, to recover the perſon whom his ſervants had conveyed thither; leaving an old man to watch what the ſea ſhould caſt up, and bring tidings if the caſe required aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>In leſs than an hour's application Sir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam's efforts were crowned with ſucceſs,— reanimation ſucceeded the ſeeming diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,—the delicate frame of a charming young lady began to exerciſe its wonted functions.—The worthy Baronet knelt down to pay the tribute of thanks and praiſe to God for bleſſing his endeavours, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked a continuance thereof. The young lady with a fervent piety, accompanied him, rendering thanks to Heaven, and pouring out a bleſſing on her deliverer from the jaws
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:022876_0015_0FBA98F995EDEFF8"/>
of death; cloſing her lips only through faintneſs. A cordial was adminiſtered with effect,—ſhe became herſelf again,—health ſeemed approaching; but reſt being deemed a neceſſary ſupply, ſhe was left in the care of Sir William's houſe-keeper, when ſleep ſeemed a welcome gueſt to her wearied ſenſes,—ſo in a profound ſlumber ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on a warm bed, whilſt the Baronet withdrew with his aſſiſtants.</p>
                  <p>Meanwhile day approached. Sir Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, anxious to know the perſon he had reſcued from death, as alſo the names and quality of thoſe who had periſhed in the ſtorm, the ſea being now ſilenced by a dead calm, ſtillneſs ſeemed to be the reigning queen of the morn, whilſt he with his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants carefully took up the bodies that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained on the piked rocks of the ſhore; ſhells were provided, and ten perſons were coffined for interment, which with a ſolemn ceremony was performed,—the worthy rector attending his duty with becoming reſpect, ſetting forth to a crowded aſſemblage of neighbouring te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants to the manor, the uncertainty of life,— the poſitive aſſurance of death,—the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of ſudden or unprovided death,— the neceſſity of being always ready,—with a pathetic diſcourſe on the heedleſſneſs of youth of both ſexes, in regard to ſeeking their Creator in the days of their youth, and the indiſpenſible neceſſity for it, to enſure a bleſſing here, and a happy immortality here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; with an alluſion to the life preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:022876_0016_0FBA98FB1932C670"/>
—that an early piety was no doubt the cauſe of prolonging it; alſo in inveigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much againſt the deteſtable word of chance,—clearly proving, that without the guidance of the Celeſtial Power, nothing was certain; for though wickedneſs might for a time bear the appearance of proſperity and happineſs, yet a certain fearful period of deſtruction awaited the delinquent. The clergyman cloſed his ſermon on the funeral of the drowned perſons, with many ſerious and practical admonitions, requiſitions, and reflections,—ſo that out of the church-yard none departed without a tear of compunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a firm reſolve to adhere to the words of their Paſtor.</p>
                  <p>When the rites of the dead were ended, Sir William had the papers of the wreck examined, when it was found the ſhip had cleared from New-York, in America, nine weeks before that period; that ſhe was call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Siſters, John Parſons, Commander; was bound for London, laden with dry goods, and had on board ſeveral ladies and gentlemen as paſſengers to England. The bad condition of the ſhip's papers precluded a further information, and put Sir William under the diſagreeable neceſſity to enquire of the young lady the other particulars re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to the voyage, and the number and quality of the perſons that were caſt away; which, owing to the fatigue and delicacy of her conſtitution, he was obliged to forego
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:022876_0017_0FBA98FC942F4068"/>
for a few days, until ſhe ſhould retrieve ſtrength of body and recollected ideas, to give a full account of herſelf, being fearful to bring to her recollection any thing that would retard her recovery.</p>
                  <p>A few days elapſed, during which time an unremitting attention was paid to the young lady's health, in order to eſtabliſh it, which with the care practiſed, ſoon accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed; yet Sir William was cautious to enquire, leſt a relapſe ſhould be the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.—Whilſt he was ruminating on the late cataſtrophe of the ſhipwreck, the poſt brought him a letter, announcing the ſafe arrival of his ſon, in England, dated from Dover; that he ſhould take in London in his route; and hoped to pay his duty in three days to his honored parent. This filled the good man with a taſte of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he never knew before; it was now, and only at this inſtant, he owned his doubts and fears for the ſafety of his ſon. Although he betrayed no ſymptons of fear outwardly, yet a continual diſagreeable phantom of imagination haunted his mind, ſtating a poſſibility,—adding a probability of his ſon being caſt away in the late violent hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricane. Such muſt be the fears of all pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, whoſe feelings are edged with a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rental care of tenderneſs and love for their offspring; where gifts of piety are beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on children, their ardour in affection and duty will be the conſequent return; this Sir
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:022876_0018_0FBA98FE81D690D8"/>
William knew, therefore enhanced the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for his amiable ſon.</p>
                  <p>The expected period of Henry's arrival being nearly advanced, the day being half ſpent, the ſun was declining from his meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dional height, when Henrietta, for ſo was ſhe called, aſked the aſſiſtance of her attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant to dreſs herſelf, fancying ſhe ſhould be better by a jaunt in Sir William's coach, which the phyſician that attended her great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enforced, though ſtrenuouſly objected to by Sir William, fearing the ſharpneſs of the air might be too much; however, by the Doctor's advice he was over-ruled. She therefore attired herſelf in an elegant ſuit of ſilk, ſuitable for the ſeaſon, richly trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with ſable, never having underſtood the fate of her relations; Sir William hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſtantly evaded any converſation on the ſubject, intending to open it by degrees, fearing the fatal effect ſuch a narration as he muſt relate, not knowing what affinity the deceaſed might have been to her; for her attendant conſtantly remarked, the whole ſhip's freight, together with the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and paſſengers, were all ſaved. The cheſts of Henrietta, wherein her cloaths, money, and jewels were depoſited, being produced, ſeemed to corroborate the truth of the houſekeeper's tale;—but there was too much in the ſequel to reveal,—and the burden was too weighty to conceal.—Thus were Sir William and Henrietta anxious to
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:022876_0019_0FBA990137B0BAA8"/>
ſpeak to each other, to ſatisfy their doubts, yet prudential caution retarded him, whilſt the young lady recovered ſufficiently to ſuſtain the ſhock. Notwithſtanding the late miraculous eſcape and the dangers ſhe encountered, Henrietta had recovered moſt ſurpriſingly; ſhe was juſt returned from an hour's excurſion in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and looked charmingly; her perſon was delicate, her comple<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="4 letters">

                  <p>Dinner was preparing and nearly ready,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:022876_0020_0FBA99029BB4E540"/>
when at the further end of the avenue a carriage appeared in view. Sir William had not power to reſtrain himſelf, but cried out in an ecſtacy of joy,—"my ſon!—my ſon!"—and then almoſt loſt utterance,—but on recollection, curbed his paſſion, by a timely remark, that he expected his ſon to dinner;—concealing from the young lady the emotion he felt on the approaching in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview with him.</p>
                  <p>Scarcely were their greetings exchanged before Henry arrived, which gave his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy father an opportunity of an happy em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace.—The ſon returned it with becoming duty and reſpect, and after enquiry of health, Sir William took his ſon aſide, and in a few words gave him a detail of all he knew of the young lady under his care;— the ſtory brought tears of pity into the young man's eyes;—he felt and ſighed for the loſs human nature had ſuſtained;—he ſaid he would, when opportunity preſented itſelf, in a reſpectful manner, propoſe to the lady ſuch queſtions as ſhould lead to a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of her name and perſon, alſo the relations ſhe had loſt, with other particulars relative to her voyage.—This Sir William approved.—They both inſtantly came into the parlour, where the young lady, the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car, and the phyſician ſat;—the gentlemen both with equal warmth gave joy to Henry on his ſafe return; he likewiſe, with becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing zeal, gave his friends a kind reply of
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:022876_0021_0FBA9904599E70F0"/>
friendſhip and thanks, and after the uſual ceremony of welcoming, took his ſeat; but before this period had place, the beautiful perſon of Henrietta caught his eye, and with humility and reſpect he gracefully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted the lady, who was not wanting to return the compliment. All parties during dinner enlarged on general topics of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, carefully avoiding any ſubject, that might hurt the lady's feelings;—but as ſoon as the cloth was removed, Henrietta opened the buſineſs by a ſincere requeſt to Sir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam, (whom ſhe very juſtly ſtyled her deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer,) if any of the perſons in the wreck had been able to eſcape the fury of the waves?—Sir William, after a little heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſaid, he feared not,—this anſwer, Henrietta replied, ſhe feared, ever ſince the return of her ſenſes, notwithſtanding the great care of the female that attended her, who had related a contrary ſtory.—Here ſhe could ſcarce refrain from tears, but by the ſoothing of the gentlemen preſent, ſhe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore to weep; eſpecially on the intreaty of the attracting young traveller, who ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily inſinuated himſelf by a reſpectful atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that ſhe voluntarily wiſhed to relate the particulars of the voyage, in order to form an opinion of the ſafety of her friends. She gave them to underſtand that ſhe was the youngeſt daughter of Lord Colville, whom ſhe hoped was then alive and well, as alſo the lady her mother; that in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:022876_0022_0FBA99060F600130"/>
of her ſiſter's being married to a field officer, who had a particular command of ſome of the King's troops in America, ſhe had been prevailed on to go with her to the continent, to which quarter ſhe was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by her brother, who held a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion under her ſiſter's huſband. That on the ſhip ſpringing a leak in the Channel, her brother, ſiſter, and her ſiſter's huſband, the captain, and ſeveral others, had taken to the long boat; but owing to a ſudden guſt of wind, they could not, or rather would not, bring too the veſſel; thoſe who remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on board being partly ungovernable, the mate refuſing to permit her to go into the boat with her friends, ſo that ſhe was forced away from her relations by a man, who, had he ſurvived, ſhe had the greateſt reaſon to dread his unlawful attachments,—Here the Knight interrupted her by a thankſgiving, in which the pious vicar added, "that the evil man ſeeks his own deſtruction;" but each aſking pardon of the lady, deſired her to proceed, to which ſhe replied, her ſtory was but a few words more;—that there were three females and ſeven males in the ſhip, when they parted company from the long-boat, and that two of thoſe females were her attendants; the other being an old lady who had reſided many years abroad, and was returning to her native country to die, as ſhe expreſſed.—As for the men who had periſhed in the ſhip, they were all of a
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:022876_0023_0FBA99071CD09E10"/>
deſperate fortune, who neither regarded themſelves or thoſe under their care; for in her opinion, a port might have been attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, had they been unanimous in their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; but ſhe had ſome reaſon to think, rapine was the prevalent gloſs under which they acted, and loſt their lives through a deſign of enriching themſelves by the money on board,—as the mate acknowledged in the hour of danger;—"ſo, to the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God," ſaid ſhe, "do I owe my miraculous eſcape from the wreck.—But my dear brothers and ſiſter!"—A flood of tears prevented her from proceeding.— when Henry addreſſed himſelf to the lady,— "madam," ſaid he, "let me give you joy; the General, who is your brother, (I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume,) your ſiſter and the honorable Mr. Colville, who is a Captain in General Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey's regiment, were, on the eve of the hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricane, picked up by a French Coaſter, and brought into Havre de Grace, from whence they arrived in England three days ago. I had the honor to be in their company,—but ocular demonſtration will corroborate what I now affirm to be truth," ſhowing the lady the London news paper, wherein the ſhip, and thoſe concerned in piratically carrying her away, were advertiſed; alſo, a reward of five hundred pounds offered by Lord Colville, for the recovery of his daughter. Here the lady's tranſport was more than her tender frame could bear;—ſhe ſwooned away in the arms of Henry, who, with the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:022876_0024_0FBA990A3AD05DB0"/>
Doctor's aſſiſtance ſoon brought her to her ſenſes, which for a few minutes ſhe could not perſuade herſelf to be poſſeſſed of; but on the Baronet's remonſtrance, ſhe with tranſport thanked the gallant Henry, who was the meſſenger of Heaven, in diſburden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her from an inſupportable load of anxious cares and troubles.—The gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men each congratulated her on the happy tidings of her friends;—her eſcape from the ſnares of a wicked man,—and happy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vival from the jaws of death;—and ſhe, with an audible voice, and a chriſtian ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, rendered thanks for the mercies and bleſſings ſhe had recently received;—in which the gentlemen with one accord joined, commending her to that Beneficent Being for future protection. After this muſic was propoſed, and Henrietta diſplayed her finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed talents on the organ. This being over, Sir William informed Henrietta, that he he was well acquainted with Lord and Lady Colville, her parents; and that he ſhould write by the return of the poſt, to acquaint them of her ſafety,—to which ſhe thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully aſſented.</p>
                  <p>Night having gained upon them, it was judged time to withdraw by the Vicar and the Doctor; and Sir William and his ſon paying their compliments to Henrietta, each of them repaired to a place of repoſe.</p>
                  <p>It was ſome time before Henry could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer his revolving ideas, to permit ſleep to
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:022876_0025_0FBA990BA8276370"/>
ſooth him, for the lovely image of Henriet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta was conſtantly in his view; he found an impreſſion already engraved,—he flouted the fanciful notion of love, yet could not ſay to what other paſſion he could attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute his ſituation.—After repeated queries and anſwers, ſolus, he was unable to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the point; ſo let ſleep gain dominion without a ſatisfactory inveſtigation. Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietta was no leſs diſturbed;—but to yield to love's impreſſions at firſt ſight, ſhe deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed romantic to a degree;—however, yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſleep before ſhe made a deciſion.</p>
                  <p>The morning approached, when Sir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam, after paying his uſual tribute of thanks to the Deity, went up ſoftly to his ſon's apartment; but how great was his ſurpriſe, and how pleaſing his reflection, when he heard him paying his tribute to God!— Hear this, ye ſons of diſſipation,—ye noc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnal revellers!—to what end is your ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous?—only for one minute conſider the difference of a virtuous and an immoral character! learn from hence true wiſdom and real underſtanding;—for in the hour of death neither right honorable, moſt honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, moſt noble, or even majeſty itſelf, can calm the pangs of a wounded conſcience!— therefore, conſider in time!—To fly from evil company, of either ſex, is the grand work of reformation,—ſo to neglect ſo great and ſo neceſſary a buſineſs, is more than the cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of madneſs or folly can ſet forth;—
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:022876_0026_0FBA990D67D61AD8"/>
it is loſing all, both here and hereafter,— for a bubble!—For what ſolid or real ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction has the ſlave of paſſions?—aſk the miſer,—the gambler,—the ſpendthrift,— the adulterer,—the defrauder,—or any of the reſt of the wretched tribe;—I anſwer, none!—any of them muſt and will own the ſame.—Therefore a clear conſcience, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right principles, to do as we would wiſh to be done by,—or, the grand ſyſtem of honor and honeſty, being ſo eaſily learned, and with ſuch pleaſure practiſed, the weakeſt or meaneſt capacity can be an adept in the ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in one leſſon,—from hence all the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and chriſtian duties will follow;—and as the happy myſtery is ſo readily obtained, the attainment needs no comment.</p>
                  <p>The Baronet's pleaſurable curioſity made him return from his ſon's chamber door without interrupting his duty to his Maker, and to go, for the firſt time in his life, on his tip-toes to a young lady's room door;— where, to his like ſatisfactory ſurpriſe, he heard her repeat her morning hymn!—Hear this, ye daughters of Eve, ye ſlaves to dreſs and faſhion! ye light headed frail votaries of pleaſure!—I aſk you, how oft, in the whole courſe of your lives, you have, either night or morning, invoked the God of power to protect and direct you?—I am without faith in the anſwer,—therefore I ſhall leave it a blank.—But conſider, your years at moſt can be but few,—that in the

grave there is no method of repentance,— that to forget the Deity, is an invitation to the grand ſeducer of the firſt of your ſex to make a prey of you,—therefore fly from folly!—your fall is for the moſt part wrought by deceit!—for ſince the days of Eve, who fell by the device of the ſerpent, all her offspring, of the female ſex, are victims to that credulity which firſt brought ſin and death into the world.—If you wiſh to be happy both here and hereafter, abhor that enemy to truth,—that croſs-eyed fawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>Flattery,</hi>—as the rock on which ſo many of your charming ſex are caſt away!— avoid flattery!—that is the monſtrous cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion of vice!—it is that deceitful imp that introduces pride, and all her followers;— the conſequences are fatal!—For Heaven's ſake avoid this one enemy, and you will conquer all the reſt;—only conſult with truth, the faithful companion of virtue, and you will readily perceive the happineſs that reſults from thence;—accompany this one of virtue's champions, and never fear the reſt; he will lead you to the pleaſant walks of piety and virtue;—'tis theſe alone can inſure you happineſs through life!—an eaſy leſſon!—If your mind is once fixed on it, your retention will for ever enſure it to you.—Pray, Ladies, don't be dormant in a work of ſuch importance; it don't preclude any part of your dreſs, if ſuited to your ſtation in life; no not any of your coſme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics;

—as effeminate foibles they are not to be accounted a pollution, ſo that decency in their uſage, or a loſs of time is not ſpent in their application.—I ſhould ſay more on the ſubject, but I avoid any digreſſion that might give offence to your ſex; my wiſhes are ſincere for the happineſs of your tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and eternal ſtate,—therefore don't be angry on reading theſe few lines by way of application;—only reflect, it is yourſelves that are concerned.—A prayer morning and evening, cannot impede any part of your domeſtic duties,—ten minutes each time will ſuffice;— practiſe this rule for one year, then I am ſure you will own that <hi>Novels contain morality, as well as pleaſing narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>;—as truths are the foundation of this work, I requeſt your attention.</p>
                  <p>Sir William practiſed the ſame art here at his ſon's chamber door, for he went his way without interrupting the lady;—and walked from his manſion to the ſummit of a rock that overhung the flowing tide, which at ebb expoſed a frightful precipice.—Here it was, at half fall of neap tide the ſhip was caſt on thoſe breakers, from which the ten perſons lately wrecked received their death wounds;—it raiſed up the contemplative ideas of this ſon of wiſdom, to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Deity in the higheſt Heaven, in glory to him who is the refuge of the juſt and faithful,—which the perſon of the honorable lady, whoſe life he had ſaved,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:022876_0029_0FBA9913AAED6140"/>
through God's aſſiſtance, he ranked amongſt the moſt valuable of her ſex; ardently wiſhing that Lord Colville would as readily conſent to the union of his ſon with her as he ſhould:—with this remark, that their perſons and minds were very much alike.— He then leiſurely walked back, when he found his ſon and Miſs Colville in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, which was very agreeable to him;— the moſt reſpectful and affectionate greet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were exchanged.</p>
                  <p>When breakfaſt was prepared, the Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net expreſſed a tenderneſs for Miſs Colville, intimating a deſire of Henry's keeping a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with her, as he was apprehenſive Lord Colville would ſoon deprive both him and his ſon of the happineſs they at preſent enjoyed in her company; ſuppoſing her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would remove her to town on receipt of his letter.—To this Miſs Colville replied, ſhe ſhould ever with gratitude to him, and reſpect to his ſon, be much honored in the correſpondence of either.—Many were the aſſurances of friendſhip that were reciprocal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exchanged; and Henry, fixing his thoughts on the beautiful object preſent, began, at his father's inſtance to deſcribe the various countries he had viſited; making remarks on the manners and cuſtoms of their inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants; taking a comparative view of their laws and conſtitutions, oppoſed to thoſe of the Engliſh Nation; which accounts, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, and applications highly entertained
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:022876_0030_0FBA9914A87EED98"/>
Miſs Colville and his father, and were ſo agreeable, as to let the forenoon ſteal away inſenſibly, till dinner was on the table.— Thus did three days elapſe in the ſociety of three good perſons, whoſe minds were of the ſame contexture.—The fourth day, pretty early in the morning, a poſt chaiſe and four horſes ſtopt in the court yard, out of which Captain Colville and Lord Dacie ſtept, who were immediately introduced to Sir William, Henry, and Miſs Colville. The Captain thanked the Baronet for the care he had taken of his ſiſter, and related to them the manner of their eſcape from the dangers of the ſea. After a tender embrace of her brother, Miſs Colville launched out into praiſes of the hoſpitality of Sir William and his ſon, to which the Captain, in a handſome manner expreſſed his obligations, as alſo thoſe of his family;—and gave Sir William to underſtand, that Lord Colville, his Lady, and a young female relation, would the next day arrive to pay their reſpects to him for the care he had taken of their daughter:— which intelligence gave great ſatisfaction to Miſs Colville, Sir William Howard, and his ſon. During the converſation between the Captain and Sir William, his ſon, and Miſs Colville, Lord Dacie ſtood in an auk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward poſture, without uttering a word, except a ſalute to the ſtrangers on his firſt entrance.—The Captain ſeemed ſomewhat embarraſſed at the cavalier behaviour of his
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:022876_0031_0FBA9916182A5720"/>
friend, who had rivetted his eyes on Miſs Colville, jogging his heel and toe ſo as to make a diſagreeable ſound.—He apologized for him, by obſerving to Sir William, that his friend, Lord Dacie, had borne him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany from town; on which Sir William complimented him in aſking how the noble Duke his father, and the Dutcheſs his mother were; to which he anſwered in an affected tone, he ſuppoſed they were very well.— However, the Baronet with his uſual polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and hoſpitality, entertained his gueſts in a ſuitable manner. After dinner, Henry recognized the perſon of my Lord, whom he had ſeen on the Continent, which gave the evenings converſation a general turn; in which the depraved taſte, the ſhallow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and the ſuperficial knowledge of his Lordſhip, was glaringly conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.—But Henry mildly paſſed over many controverted matters, in which Lord Dacie egregiouſly ſtated them his own way, regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neither compoſition or diſpoſition in his garulity.</p>
                  <p>At an early hour Miſs Colville wiſhed the gentlemen good night, being tired with the inſipped parade of his Lordſhip; as a pellucid vein of libertiniſm was perceptible in all he could enlarge on;—adding to every other ſentence, an oath of confirmation.</p>
                  <p>The character which he bore on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, as well as in the Metropolis, which was well known to Henry, was that of a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulant
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:022876_0032_0FBA99197B8B2230"/>
coxcomb; therefore no intimacy ever ſubſiſted between his Lordſhip and Henry, —for in truth they were opponents by princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Captain Colville was not ſo; he was nearly in a medium between the two former characters, conſequently coherent to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of either diſpoſition,—being compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible to a virtuous or vicious guidance.</p>
                  <p>The increaſed hour of the clock ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned them to reſt.—The morning uſhered in a fine day,—the vicar paid his reſpects, and was ſtayed by Sir William to breakfaſt. Lord Dacie immediately oppoſed the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the cloth of the Captain and the Parſon, upon which each party politely gave precedence to the other;—however, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet jeſt of the ſhallow-headed hero did not eſcape a ſharp reproof from the lady.— She obſerved, the reverend name command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed reſpect; as alſo the honorable ſervice of a potentate, or national repreſentative;— but then the former certainly had the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;—yet in her opinion the latter had a pre-eminence over law or phyſic, which bore a component ſound, as liberal profeſſions, with divinity; but wherefore they were tag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged together ſhe was at a loſs to ſuggeſt.— However, as a literary character, ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed to his Lordſhip for a ſolution.—The weakneſs of his underſtanding was immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcovered by the embarraſſment he ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under;—he got up, took his coffee in his hand, walked to the window, ſipped it,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:022876_0033_0FBA991C05549BD8"/>
and returned;—ſilence reigned univerſal!— upon which, the Captain indiſcreetly burſt forth into an immoderate fit of laughter, ſaying: "my Lord, you are foiled."— Lord Dacie replied, "I wonder at your ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation; do you think I reaſon with women?"—and walked to the window again in a pet.—Miſs Colville was not at all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed, but with her uſual good humoured aſpect, ſaid:—"my Lord, our ſex thank you,—or in other words, I thank you in their name, for your refuſal to ſpeak reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to any of us;—I hope your own ſex may not experience the ſame inconvenience."</p>
                  <p>Sir William Howard changed the ſubject, fearing an obloquy thrown out by any of the young perſons might tend to a bad conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, well knowing, juvenile heat would ſeldom avow, tho' indiſcreetly depart from conſiſtency;—and in general terms, ſaid, "I am certain we have all ſeen the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan cities of England and France, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhould be glad of your ſeparate opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, whether we, or our neighbours, have gained the palm with reſpect to taſte and refinement, in arts and ſciences; and which city can boaſt of the moſt ſuperb buildings, ſquares, recreations, and outlets?"</p>
                  <p>To which Lord Dacie, in a haſty tone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, "there is no compariſon;—except London bore an analogy, as a ſhilling to a guinea, if compared with Paris;—for what ſignifies," continued he, "the amplitude of
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:022876_0034_0FBA991CDEA1D7B8"/>
that trading city, when the taſte and elegance of Paris is mentioned?—Can we compare the choaked Thames with the grand river Seine,—whoſe banks are not crowded with buildings to the water's edge, but a parade of near an hundred feet in breadth between the houſes and the river?—the parapet wall being low, adds a grandeur to the river, that the muddy Thames cannot preſume to command.—If you look eaſtward towards the Pont Neuf, you have the whole range of the old and new Louvre on one ſide, and the Mazarin College on the other;—look down the river weſtward, the Thuilleries Gardens on one ſide, and the Palais de Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon, with the grand Hoſpital on the other, are ſuch views, that London has nothing to compare with them."</p>
                  <p>"I grant you," ſaid Henry, "that thoſe views are very pleaſing; but your prejudice magnifies more than Newton's teleſcope, as London is at this time one of the firſt cities in Europe, or I may ſay the world:—for tho' the buildings come cloſe to the water's edge, yet there is a convenience that reſults there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, which would not be equalled by rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a four foot wall to pleaſe the eye of an idle ſpectator.—Tho' we are not without views ſuperior to thoſe you have mentioned; —for, look up from Black-Friar's Bridge, and you take five times the ſcope you ſeem to make the moſt of.—In the firſt place, the Thames is four times the width of the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:022876_0035_0FBA991E54FF4E20"/>
Seine,—our bridges bear the ſame compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in length, for take the Pont Royal and Black-Friar's Bridge, what is the one to the other?—The Place de Victoires is by no means equal to Groſvenor-Square;—nor the boaſted ſtreet of the Boulevards, equal to Oxford-ſtreet;—nay, the Palais Royal, if diveſted of its tinſelled front, what are the chambers compared with thoſe of St. James's?"—Here the Captain obſerved, "Gentlemen, I know but little of either London or Paris, tho' our family were the beſt part of a year in the latter.—I ſhall appoint an arbitrator, if you are both wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to abide the deciſion."—Henry replied, "with all my heart,"—his Lordſhip only ſaid, "every one to his own way of thinking, but certainly the French were the moſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed people."—Sir William rallied his Lordſhip on calling the ſons of ancient free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom into the conteſt:—for it was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons but things that were propoſed for il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtration.—The vicar wiſhed to be neuter, —though he muſt obſerve, that in his time old England had no rival, if her qualities were known.</p>
                  <p>Miſs Colville obſerved, that both nations poſſeſſed greatneſs;—in her way of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, France could ſay "Paris was great" but England could at the ſame time pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim, "London was greater."—Sir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam complimented her on her ſagacity,— which cloſed the converſation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="33" facs="unknown:022876_0036_0FBA991FE20F0E20"/>The vicar being ſummoned to attend a ſick perſon, and Sir William to decide a controverſy in his official capacity as a juſtice of the peace, the young people were left to converſe by themſelves.</p>
                  <p>The captain gave Henry a friendly invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to town, which he very politely decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; alledging, he ſhould not be able to do himſelf the honor.—The arrival of Lord and Lady Colville, with Miſs Dampier, their niece was announced, which drew the attention of all parties.—Lady Colville, it is natural to ſuppoſe, was agreeably ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, on ſeeing her ſuppoſed loſt child in Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietta, not having ſeen her for nearly two years;—his Lordſhip, her father, alſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly embraced his daughter;—joy was dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed on all ſides in the ſight of each other. —By this time Sir William Howard was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed from his ſuppliants, and was highly gratified with the interview; giving them joy in their child, and a hearty welcome to Howard's Caſtle,—which was anſwered with grateful acknowledgments by Lord and Lady Colville.</p>
                  <p>The young lady who was come to ſee her couſin Henrietta, with her uncle and aunt, was alſo a couſin to Lord Dacie, being ſiſter's children; ſo that a proximity of kindneſs pervaded the ſtrangers at Howard's Caſtle.</p>
                  <p>After dinner the the ladies and gentlemen ſeparated, upon which Lady Colville gave her daughter to underſtand, that ſhe muſt
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:022876_0037_0FBA9923C920DE48"/>
look upon Lord Dacie in a favourable light in future; as the Duke his father, and Lord Colville, her father, had agreed upon the match; and that an acquaintance between her and the young Lord, ſo as to ſettle their affections, was the only impediment to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract ſolemnization.—However, her Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip aſſured her daughter, that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the refractory temper of Lord Colville, if the propoſition did not meet Henrietta's plenary approbation, ſhe hoped to find means to ſecede from the intended union.— Miſs Colville liſtened to her mother's propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, or rather information of her fathers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions;—her father ſhe knew to be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,—her mother humane and tender in her diſpoſition,—yet eaſily overruled;— therefore, Henry's perſonage recurred moſt forcibly to her imagination.—To contraſt him with Dacie, was the extremity of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees in compariſon.</p>
                  <p>Miſs Dampier obſerved to Miſs Colville, the rank and fortune of her couſin, Lord Dacie, and the certainty of her arriving to a ducal coronet, if ſhe gave her hand to the amiable young nobleman, as ſhe ſtiled Dacie; — for Miſs Dampier partook of ſome of his qualities, ſo far as pride, a prepoſterous taſte, a loquacity never to ceaſe, together with prejudicial opinions that were inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mountable.—She was therefore a perſon whom Henrietta had reaſon to treat with civility as a relation, yet with ſo much pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:022876_0038_0FBA99260488F320"/>
as to guard againſt her admitting her into confidence; ſo that her reply was ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.—She obſerved to Charlotte Dampier, that ſuch things required time to ſeriouſly conſider,—remarking, that altho' life was uncertain, and ſhort in the enjoyment of its pleaſures,—yet marriage was a ſound that conveyed a ſolemnity, and required mature deliberation:—for it was not conditionally for life, but abſolutely ſo, until death calls for a ſeparation.—Charlotte laughed hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily at her couſin's morality, as ſhe called it, and wiſhed ſome of her acquaintance had heard her.—Lady Colville, in her uſual ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der manner waved the diſcourſe, obſerving the levity of her niece, well knowing the flighty turn of Charlotte was oppoſite to the temper of Henrietta;—ſhe therefore jocoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, deſired Charlotte to deſiſt, by remarking her temper to be like her father's—alluding to Sir James Dampier, who was Lady Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville's own brother.</p>
                  <p>The ladies being ſeated at tea, we ſhall take a peep at what the gentlemen were about,—which was ſimply in the ancient ſtyle of Engliſh hoſpitality,—wine and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.—Sir William more than once had it at his tongue's end to propoſe an union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his ſon and Lord Colville's daughter, Henrietta,—but juſt as he was determined to open the matter, his Lordſhip let the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret out, by informing the company then preſent, (Lord Dacie having ſtept to the
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:022876_0039_0FBA99275AE20CB0"/>
garden) that the young lord was fixed upon by him and his father, to intermarry with his daughter;—which he judged an excellent match, as he termed it.—Upon which Sir William caſt his eyes towards Henry, whom he perceived was ſomewhat chagrined at Lord Colville's avowal.—Sir William was not ſufficiently collected in his ideas to make any reply; his ſurpriſe was ſo great, to find that a lady of ſuch excellent parts as he knew Miſs Colville to poſſeſs, ſhould be made a ſlave to ſuch a ſapſcull as Dacie;—therefore, Lord Colville, and his ſon the Captain, were at a loſs to account for the delay of Sir William's anſwer.—Henry at that juncture withdrawing himſelf,—it was a few minutes before Sir William ſpoke to the queſtion;— but then with a great deal of reſerve, and a viſible coolneſs which he could not get over, obſerved, "that Miſs Colville was a lady deſerving of the firſt character in the realm, and was every thing her ſex ought to be,"— Lord Colville abruptly replied, "his care was to provide for her maintenance, by chooſing a man, as a huſband for his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who had a ſufficient income to make him independent; and that the young noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man he was ſo fortunate to make choice of, was heir to an eſtate of fifteen thouſand a year,—there being but a ſiſter to provide for who was two years younger then Lord Dacie; ſo that Henrietta had but little to fear when united with a perſon of the rank
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:022876_0040_0FBA99290B620060"/>
and fortune of his lordſhip." Sir William ſeemed to acquieſce, which cloſed the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, Lord Dacie entering the room.</p>
                  <p>Meanwhile Henry had the pleaſure of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with the ladies, who were mutually one and all charmed with his converſation, his vivacity and good humour being proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties not to be equalled; —adding, to an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of perſon ſcarcely to be met with, an air and deportment manly and noble.</p>
                  <p>Both Henry and Henrietta knowing the intentions of Lord Colville, though ſuppoſing each other ſtrangers to them, it drew their eyes ſo forcibly, that they often met,—and darts of unutterable anguiſh pierced their hearts; ſo that repeated ſighs were heaved involuntarily, which gave the quick-ſighted Charlotte ſome idea of the ſymptoms.—But ſhe dared not utter a groundleſs ſuſpicion, until more corroborating circumſtances oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred to enſure her of the orthodox of her belief.</p>
                  <p>The gentlemen now mixed company, and Henry received a rallying on his effeminan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, to prefer tea before wine.—Here he had the advantage, by making a confeſſion, "that ladies were of that attaching quality, that a permiſſion to be in their company without refreſhments, was ſuperior to any repaſt in the company of his own ſex."— For this compliment Lady Colville thanked him, and jollity ſeemed to pervade the whole evening.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="38" facs="unknown:022876_0041_0FBA992E1A47E7C0"/>Early the next morning Sir William, at ebb-tide, ſhowed Lord and Lady Colville the ſituation the ſhip was wrecked in, with the manner of their daughter's miraculous eſcape.</p>
                  <p>A week paſſed as a ſhort ſpace to all parties, except to Lord Dacie, who wiſhed to return to town, having planted a ſufficient quantity of the ſeeds of jealouſy, to make his abode at Howard's Caſtle intolerable,— but through the perſauſion of Lord Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville he conſented to ſtay three days longer.</p>
                  <p>Sir William Howard acquitted himſelf ſo well in the eſtimation of his viſitants, that all were happy, except the exceptionable perſon juſt now mentioned, who ſuffered in the extreme to find every perſon attached to Henry; who, (by Sir William's inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency it came out,) would, on his demiſe, be in poſſeſſion of twenty thouſand pounds per annum.—Alſo had in expectancy an income of an equal ſum, with a Ducal Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronet annexed. Yet nevertheleſs, Henry's manner was meekneſs, added to a becoming cheerfulneſs, that made him the object of univerſal admiration.</p>
                  <p>The rumour of the extraordinary circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the ſhipwreck, by this time had found its way into all the news-papers throughout the kingdom,—therefore drew ſome perſons of diſtinguiſhed rank to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the truth of the matter.— The Duke of Kingſborough, accompanied
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:022876_0042_0FBA992F9756EE08"/>
by the Marquis of Languedoc, his Lady, and their beautiful daughter, were curious enough to take a trip to Howard's Caſtle,— at which ſeat they arrived the morning that Lord Colville and his company intended ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out for London.—The arrival of thoſe noble perſonages retarded their journey, as the Duke of Kingſborough and Lord Colville were intimately acquainted.—Sir William Howard ſatisfactorily gave a detail of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtrophe, upon which it was determined Lord Colville ſhould ſtay a few days longer.</p>
                  <p>His Grace of Kingſborough was happy in converſing with Henry Howard, who was his nephew and heir apparent, which, when Lord Colville underſtood, he was ſorry he had engaged with the Duke of Aſhbridge, Lord Dacie's father,—but as a man of honor he took no ſteps to retract.</p>
                  <p>The reader may naturally ſuppoſe, that in ſo polite an aſſemblage of notables, every ſpecies of recreation the country afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was enjoyed;—a grand fete was given, but the ſeaſon was rather too far advanced. —The ball room was finiſhed in the higheſt taſte, by the exertions of the ladies and gentlemen.—Lady Olivia, the Marquis of Languedoc's daughter, was Henry's partner; ſhe was a perſon of great ſkill in the lively ſcenes of feſtivity, ſo that theſe two bore the laurel of the evening, as well as the ſway of the morning. Olivia was a finiſhed beauty, and had received what is ſtiled a good educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:022876_0043_0FBA993113D076C8"/>
in the Beau monde—and therefore might juſtly ſay, what report of merit has ſaid, <hi>Je le tiens.</hi>—Miſs Colville had but indifferent paſtime;—clogged with Lord Dacie, who was but a poor ſubſtitute to ſhow the graces of the ball room;—ſuch a partner no doubt diſconcerted Henrietta,—who was brilliant in her manner, but had no means to exhibit to advantage.—The near approaches of a ſucceeding day brought them to a reſolution of changing the ſcene,—ſo that for once in the courſe of the regular practice of thirty years, Sir William was found in bed until nearly nine o'clock in the morning. Noon ſummoned the fatigued partakers of pleaſure to the breakfaſt room, every eye ſparkled with pleaſure,—nothing impeded the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſatisfaction that was diffuſed throughout the perſons that compoſed this polite circle, —for Dacie had nipped in the bud the ſprouts of jealouſy, that ſuſpicion had in a fit of malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſport dropt in his boſom. The charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Olivia, by the conſent of all parties, and particularly at the inſtance of the Duke, was recommended to Henry's care;—there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſerenity ſat on Dacie's brow,—eaſe, though awkward, gave him her place. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony thus beguiled all the ſtrangers in the weſt, until the hoary-headed month of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember had taken poſſeſſion of the fourth day in his ſovereignty;—nor would the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling breezes of the aged ſeaſon have diſturbed the happineſs of Howard's Caſtle, but that

ſeveral of the gentlemen had an intereſt in the wrangling of the law; and as thoſe who poſſeſs the qualifications of acting as ſcribes or advocates, are not always in a hurry to prefer the intereſt of their clients to that of their own, it was a prudent ſtep, in looking to the practice of the gentlemen of the long robe, ſo far as conſiſtency would admit of. —Without aſperſing the characters of honor and integrity that are the pillars of the law, it will not be improper to obſerve, how many quacks and illiterate pretenders there are in the profeſſion,—who, like moths in a garment, ſpoil conſiderable property, to purloin a pittance to ſupport their ignoble characters; to the utter ruin of families, who become burdens to the community, through the atrocity of ſuch wretches, who would be more ſerviceable in the new ſettlements of Botany Bay, then in the old eſtabliſhed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Great-Britain and its dependen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.—But thoſe peſts of ſociety render abortive the excellent uſes of the law of this country, by their groſs abuſes of it;—for their lengths are the extent of impunity, and ſometimes a ſtep beyond it;—but then there is a loop to creep out at to avert the penalty of ſuch violation.—Yet the evil can never be eradicated, until the mode of admiſſion is rectified; as the candidates for the greateſt truſt, integrity can aſſume, are admitted, without any qualification, except having ſerved, or attended a limited term of years,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:022876_0045_0FBA99365D949608"/>
and then on paying a certain number of fees, are legally admitted to plunder according to law!—a ſhameful neglect in the wiſdom of the ſupreme council of the nation!—for it is the gentlemen who bear the title of attornies, that are the ſet of men who want the pruning knife,—to act in the Pruſſian faſhion, by lopping off three fourths of the ſuperfluous ſhoots and rotten branches.—The gentlemen who are called to the bar are not the active agents in the iniquitous practice of protract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuits at law,—it is the tribe of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going deſcription.</p>
                  <p>All the nobility and gentry having taken an affectionate leave of Sir William and his ſon, they were at leiſure to concert what was neceſſary to be done. Sir William having vacated his ſeat, and a writ being iſſued, Henry was elected without oppoſition; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt needs attend parliament after the Chriſtmas receſs. Sir William gave his ſon ſeveral political leſſons,—to which he faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully promiſed to concede in every matter he ſhould be concerned in. The holidays being over, nothing material occurred. Henry took his leave of Sir William to give his maiden ſpeech in the ſenate, which was on a queſtion of national importance; on which he was loudly applauded in the houſe, and his ſpeech publiſhed at full length in the news-papers. Sir William was not a little gratified in the difference of the modeſt account given by Henry in his letter, and of
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:022876_0046_0FBA9937D54530C0"/>
thoſe in the news-papers announced of his talents. A few days attendance on the duties of the ſenate, gave Henry a popular name;—yet he was not intoxicated with the plaudits of the multitude;—wiſely reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the luculent ſpring was by a ſingle drop made lutulent,—therefore he modeſtly refuſed all panegyric on his abilities which periodical writers held out.</p>
                  <p>About this time Captain Colville gave him an invitation to Colville-Houſe, which was within a few ſtreets of Henry's dwelling; his reſidence being at his uncle's houſe, the Duke of Kingſborough, Sir William having had no town houſe for ſome years. Henry accepted of his friend's invitation, for he ſtill had a wiſh to ſee Henrietta, although he concluded ſhe was to be the wife of Dacie. —Yet it gave him a kind of pleaſure that reſults from the purity of mental faculties; as he wiſhed for the happineſs of the perſon who made the firſt impreſſion of a tactile nature, which ſhould now only bear the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation of friendſhip, yet required a pandect of the ſofteſt paſſion to eradicate it.</p>
                  <p>But as before remarked, Henry had a perfect maſtery over his paſſions, therefore latitudinarianiſm was a courſe he abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;—ſo that he went with pleaſure to ſee his friends.—He received compliments from Lord and Lady Colville, General Mounſey and his Lady, Miſs Dampier, and ſeveral others, but was ſurprized he did not
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:022876_0047_0FBA9939520EFC60"/>
ſee Henrietta.—He enquired how ſhe did, was told very well, but was not in town; ſhe was on a viſit to Lady Ann Cateſby, the ſiſter of Lord Dacie, at Aſhbridge, the ſeat of the Duke his father.</p>
                  <p>Until this inſtant Henry was never at a a loſs for recollection,—but the frailty of human nature, often, in a conflict with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, is more than a conqueror, for every perſon preſent obſerved the diſorder of the minute, and was queſtioned as to the cauſe of his ſudden indiſpoſition, which he hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily overcame in a ſhort time; giving out, that a dizzineſs, to which he was often ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, was the cauſe, though he was then under preſcription for it, which he hoped would prove a panacea.—This paſſed very well of all preſent, except Charlotte Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier, who had other motives to germinate her ſuſpicions.</p>
                  <p>The day paſſed extremely well,—the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral wiſhed to cultivate an acquaintance with Henry, and a future day was appointed at his houſe for the pleaſure of ſeeing each other.—Miſs Dampier, in ſpite of her coquetting, found her heart was not free,— that Henry had treſpaſſed innocently;—this was done without his knowledge, therefore we ſhall exculpate him.—No method pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, as practicable to the wounded fair, to lay the ſtate of her grievances before her paramour, at length a letter was conſidered the beſt intelligencer;—for oft times literal
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:022876_0048_0FBA993D710CA7E8"/>
conveyance will ſet forth diſtinctly, what verbal conference would ſhrink from.— Wherefore, courtſhip by letter is recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended as the moſt delicate method of introduction;—and where deceit cannot appear in more colours than one,—ſo of courſe eaſily detected.</p>
                  <p>Henry was aſtoniſhed at the billet-doux of Charlotte,—being unable to form a conjecture that would carry a feazability in what ſhe meant, whether jeſt or earneſt; but in compliance with the rules of decorum, he ſent an anſwer, in which an explanation was required. The giddy fair-one judged the requiſition was beſt, if an opportunity ſerved, to deliver it orally—which was done by her calling on Henry at his apartments in his uncle's houſe. It was very diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Henry, to receive a lady into the houſe, without the knowledge of his uncle, and to deny her an audience, after admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, would be likewiſe a ſtill more irkſome taſk to a perſon of his feelings;—for he found himſelf conſiderably agitated by the imprudence of his viſitant:—as, in females, nothing can argue a greater ſhare of indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, than to degrade themſelves by acting maſculine characters, to pay thoſe viſits that ſhould be paid to them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, let ladies of prudence and virtue have that coercive principle, to avoid ſuch unbecoming ſteps towards levity.</p>
                  <p>A long converſation enſued, but the
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:022876_0049_0FBA993EA2F60AF0"/>
wiſdom Henry poſſeſſed was unſhaken. No advantages were preſumed, and much leſs taken, although a breach of the laws of prudence might have been otherwiſe handled by many of our depraved pragmatic heroes of modern taſte. Here the ſcale was balanced. Miſs Dampier took her leave, though unſatisfied as to Henry's frankneſs,— for though he alledged he was not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaged, nor yet averſe to the happineſs of a connubial ſtate, he pleaded for time to conſider,—never offering to kiſs her lips;— a pleaſure ſhe hoped to enjoy. But ſuch inflammatory incitements, often tend to the worſt conſequences;—a practice though faſhionable, yet
<q>more honored in the breach than the obſervation of it</q>
for ladies who wiſh to reap the advantages of this life, and that to come, ſhould conduct themſelves with the utmoſt caution; and doubt every thing that carries an appearance of danger with it. But the lady in queſtion did not poſſeſs the neceſſary ingredients to avoid an imputation of cenſure, which is a ſtain to the character of a virtuous woman, not eaſily effaced, and often terminates in a flaw through life. Thus the enamorata retired from an unſatisfactory interview.— However an emiſſary was ſent the next morning with an elucidation, ſetting forth, her ſuſpicions of his attachment to her cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin, Miſs Colville, with a recital of what he already knew,—the intentions of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:022876_0050_0FBA99402E717B08"/>
of Lord Dacie and Henrietta; hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſhe had for ſome time ſuſpected what ſhe feared was too true:—but her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours ſhould be exerted to haſten the ſolemnization of the nuptials of her cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins,—as they both were of the ſame affinity to her;—with ſeveral indirect inſidious words, which had ſo great an effect upon Henry, as to hurt his feelings very much.— He ſaw plainly what kind of a woman he had to deal with,—how dangerous it was either to encourage or reject her paſſion;— and that ſhe would not be baulked eaſily.— This dilemma put him to the <hi>ne plus ultra</hi> of acting.—An anſwer, as was required, was returned.</p>
                  <p>This ſingular circumſtance nearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived Henry of his vivacity;—however, a reſpite was granted until the appointment at General Mounſey's took place; a day of much buſineſs, as intended by Miſs Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier. The day arrived which brought with it all the gaiety and ſplendour of the town; it was that appointed for celebrating her Majeſty's birth day; therefore, the notables throughout the Metropolis, aſſiſted in pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their compliments to ſo amiable a pair as the nation is bleſſed with;—for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample given by the Royal Perſonages, is not to be equalled; and juſtly merits the approbation and admiration of every liberal minded perſon throughout Europe.</p>
                  <p>The ladies and gentlemen aſſembled at
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:022876_0051_0FBA99419E480788"/>
General Mounſey's were very numerous; and in the aſſemblage, were the Dukes of Kingſborough and Aſhbridge, with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of the latter, as alſo Lord and Lady Colville and family, conſequently Henrietta was included.—For the firſt time Henry ſaw the beautiful Lady Ann Cateſby,—Lady Olivia Beaumont, the lovely daughter of the Marquis of Languedoc was in her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; they were with Henrietta, three of the firſt toaſts in this kingdom, each being an accompliſhed woman.—Miſs Dampier had a watchful eye on Henry, therefore he was precluded the ſcope he would otherwiſe have taken in innocent recreations.—The court ball called the whole group to St. James's, ſo that Miſs Dampier loſt her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended hour of interview, which ſhe fancied portended ſuch happineſs;—vain of the large fortune ſhe knew ſhe ſhould poſſeſs, (which was ſuperior by far to any of the ladies already mentioned) a pride (of all others the moſt contemptible,) took poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of her ſoul; betokening a low taſte, an avaricious diſpoſition, and an inclination the reverſe of every thing a lady ſhould be.</p>
                  <p>Henry was elegant in the ball room.— The ladies Ann Cateſby and Henrietta Colville were minuet partners;—Lady Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via Beaumont a country dance partner;— Henrietta then was a ſecond time his partner, —Having led down the dance they had an opportunity to exchange a few words,— Henry gave the argument or heads of the
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:022876_0052_0FBA9943518A1108"/>
Chapter of Accidents relative to Charlotte Dampier;—Henrietta alſo related the arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary meaſures that were put in practice to gain her compliance to intermarry with Lord Dacie,—alſo gave Henry to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that he was not indifferent in Lady Olivia's eyes, and might expect a literal explanation.</p>
                  <p>Nothing further paſſed, Lord Dacie join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the company; being extremely fond of his intended bride, and tenacious to ſecure her perſon. The aſſembly having broke up about three o'clock in the morning, the whole company who had left the General's houſe returned thither; not one, even amongſt the ſeniors, complaining of the want of reſt, as all wiſhed to <hi>ſuivez raiſon,</hi> ſo far as they might ſay, <hi>Loyal je ſerai du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant ma vie bon vouloir ſervir le majeſté,</hi> ſo kept the night in honor of the day, and the ſucceeding day in honor of the night, to make for once an excuſe <hi>loyalté me oblige.</hi>— Here it might be excuſable for <hi>once,</hi> but never ſhould be repeated; as human nature will not admit of a repetition of ſuch recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations as would prevent a neceſſary recruit of thoſe animal ſpirits which are diſperſed by the exertion of our faculties; for were ladies to endeavour to acquire a knowledge of philoſophy, inſtead of ſpending their time in learning uſeleſs foreign languages, they would thereby enlarge their faculties, and gain, if not a precedence to, at leaſt
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:022876_0053_0FBA9945AD287490"/>
an equality with the male ſex.—It is not the boaſted knowledge gained by converſing in ſeminaries of learning, that can give us a knowledge of mankind;—with what can the fuſty ſtyle of the Greeks or the Romans enrich our minds, when their languages are dead to us?—like many other antiquated cuſtoms,
<q>more honored in the breach than the obſervance.</q>
—Indeed, in any of the learned profeſſions, Latin and Greek are only neceſſary to preſerve the dignity of the profeſſion.—Therefore, Ladies who would wiſh to be acquainted with the writings of the Greek or Latin poets, ſhould read ſome good tranſlations, and they would be more than a match for thoſe critics of mouldy ſcraps, who pride themſelves in their unintelligible profundity and dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical principles.</p>
                  <p>It is now time to inform our readers, that all the company went from General Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey's, except Miſs Colville and Henry Howard, who, through the perſuaſion of the General took a morning's nap. The afternoon furniſhed the tea-table. The General and Mrs. Mounſey were highly taken with Henry, often wiſhing, that an union between him and Henrietta had taken place;—but as nothing in an honorable manner could for the preſent occur, all thoughts of it were laid aſide; yet with a ſecret reſolve on the part of the General, to bring it about if poſſible, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:022876_0054_0FBA9949B3DC7D40"/>
the obſtinate temper of his father-in-law.—Henry and Miſs Colville ſpent the day together with the greateſt ſatisfaction; their diſpoſitions being ſo ſimilar, that it might be ſaid they poſſeſſed but one mind.— The General preſſed Henry to make one at a card party that evening, with which he reluctantly complied, fearing his preſence might create groundleſs ſuſpicions to the prejudice of Miſs Colville's character; well knowing, Miſs Dampier would make a handle of the leaſt appearance whereby ſhe could raiſe the anger of Lord Dacie; and by diſturbing the tranquillity of the two families, conſequently diſable Henry from having an opportunity of converſing with Miſs Colville. Henrietta let Mrs. Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey into the ſecret of Miſs Dampier's attack on Henry, which created a good deal of mirth between the Ladies. The General and Henry were both preſſing to know the ſecret, which Miſs Colville ſtrenuouſly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed;—however, by the General's ſolicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Mrs. Mounſey conſented to relate it, if Henry gave permiſſion. This requeſt he did not heſitate to comply with, yet accuſed himſelf of remiſſneſs, on hearing Miſs Dampier's affair was the cauſe of the Ladies ſport,—as it was really imprudent in Henry to divulge it, without the ſtricteſt injunction to keep it inviolably a ſecret;—but he left no reſtraint on Miſs Colville in that reſpect, therefore he could only blame himſelf.—
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:022876_0055_0FBA994B15CFFC00"/>
The General was very merry on the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence given, and in a friendly manner cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Henry againſt the arts that might be practiſed by Miſs Dampier, in which he was joined by Mrs. Mounſey. Miſs Colville ſaid but little, only remarked it was too forward for a lady.—Company increaſed,—Captain Colville being of the party, the evening paſſed very agreeably;—it was near ten o'clock at night, when Miſs Dampier enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the room; her relations were at a loſs to conjecture what could have brought her thither at that hour.—But the facetious General enquired into the ſtate of her mind, which the love-ſick lady reliſhed but indifferently; apologized for her interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch good company; and ſaid, ſhe came thither at that hour on buſineſs of ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to her couſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Lord Dacie, whom ſhe thought to have found there.</p>
                  <p>Henry felt himſelf uneaſy at the ſight of that lady, as did Miſs Colville, neither of whom had the preſence of mind to ſpeak to Miſs Dampier, who, with a malicious ſmile ſaid, "ſo, lady and gentleman, you are both too well employed to ſpeak," and then, like a bow-ſhot diſappeared. We may naturally ſuppoſe they were both hurt very much by that lady's odd manner of ſalutation, yet were at a loſs to account for ſuch conduct. —The General, by a pleaſant joke, gave Henry, in a low voice, the ſubſtance of his thoughts reſpecting the ſtrange viſit juſt now
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:022876_0056_0FBA994C187E1C70"/>
paid by Miſs Dampier, in which he coincid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The company ſoon after broke up, when no perſuaſion could avail, for Henry was reſolved on going to his uncle's.—On his leaving the General's houſe, Capt. Colville accompanied him, and informed him, that on his coming to his brother's, he had ſeen Lord Dacie and Miſs Dampier ſtanding at the entrance of an avenue, in converſation with Betty, his ſiſter Henrietta's waiting-maid; but on his approach they diſappear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.—Henry found there was ſomething in preparation which he judged was not ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on honorable principles,—however, he truſted to the method he had hitherto inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riably practiſed, to acquit himſelf with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor againſt the united forces of calumny and perfidy; the only productions the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinations of evil-minded perſons can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get.—The Captain took his leave with a deſign to give him a meeting in the morning at breakfaſt.—Henry retired to reſt, ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected by the unaccountable appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the evening; caſting up the moſt that could be made of them, he found he had nothing to fear from the lady or gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in queſtion;—rightly judging, Miſs Colville's maid-ſervant acted as an emiſſary; therefore to inform Henrietta muſt be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to in the morning.—At an early hour Henry's ſervant carried a letter to Miſs Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville, warning her againſt a breach of her ſervant's truſt.—An anſwer was received by
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:022876_0057_0FBA994E57D24FF8"/>
Henry, acknowledging the obligation for his care, at the ſame time informing him, that her brother, on his parting with him the preceding night, had told her what he had ſeen,—upon which Betty made a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, that by a gift of a few guineas, Lord Dacie and Miſs Dampier had prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on her to watch the conduct of Mr. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard and Miſs Colville,—for what reaſon ſhe did not know,—but believed Lord Dacie would do Mr. Howard all the injury in his power.</p>
                  <p>Upon reading the contents, Mr. Howard could not readily account for all the ſcenes of the piece in rehearſal. Preſently Capt. Colville called agreeable to his promiſe. After breakfaſt they went together to pay a morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing's viſit to General Mounſey and the ladies. Lord Dacie was beforehand with them, and ſeemed pleaſed to ſee Mr. Howard, and gave him an invitation to Aſhbridge, which Mr. Howard declined in the moſt polite man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but his Lordſhip would take no denial, ſo Mr. Howard, after ſeveral importunities conſented, being ſurpriſed at the ſeeming friendſhip of Dacie; but with prudence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to guard againſt every advantage. Captain Colville, and the ladies, were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond deſcription perplexed to account for Lord Dacie's great good-nature to Mr. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,—as Miſs Colville obſerved, from the beginning of their acquaintance, what a diſlike Dacie ſeemed to have to Mr. Howard;
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:022876_0058_0FBA99501F8B8408"/>
but the General entering the room almoſt at that inſtant, Lord Dacie alſo aſked him to favour him with his company at Aſhbridge, to which he readily conſented, and enquired who were the others that were to compoſe the party? to this Dacie, in a vague man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſaid, a few ſelect friends.—The Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, in his uſual vein of humour, replied, perhaps enemies; Dacie ſeemed hurt at his joke. Here the ſubject concluded, and Lord Dacie, wiſhing a good morning, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Howard had none preſent but his friends, for the Captain had wholly forſaken his intended relation Lord Dacie, and was cloſely attached to the intereſt of Mr. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard.—Of the reſt, Henry had every aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of friendſhip.—The national concerns required Mr. Howard's attendance in the Houſe of Commons, and he, of courſe, took an early leave; Miſs Colville was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the neceſſity of attending her mother, who was indiſpoſed;—the Captain bearing her company, the General and his lady were left alone. In the evening Miſs Dampier paid them a viſit in ſeeming good ſpirits, and made kind enquiries for Mr. Howard, who, ſhe ſaid, was a gentleman of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed abilities; to this Mrs. Mounſey made no reply, the General withdrawing previous to her <hi>entrée.</hi>—"But," continued Miſs Dampier, "is it not provoking, that "my couſin Henrietta will at all times con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:022876_0059_0FBA995317F1DA30"/>
herſelf ſo imprudently, as to ſhun Lord Dacie's company, if Mr. Howard's can be reſorted to?—this is not becoming, notwithſtanding all her boaſted religion."— "Pray, Madam," replied Mrs. Mounſey, "do not give yourſelf the liberty to aſperſe an abſent character, eſpecially one who is undeſerving of the venom you would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly diſcharge; I beg you will not cenſure my ſiſter."—Theſe words rouſed the fiery diſpoſition of Charlotte; ſhe, in an elevated tone rejoined, by aſking Mrs. Mounſey if ſhe could deny what ſhe had aſſerted? if not, then Mrs. Mounſey was equally culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to connive at ſuch duplicity.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Mounſey took little notice of her invective, but intreated her to chooſe ſome other time, when the perſon whom ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed againſt might be preſent; to theſe words Charlotte made no reply, but haſtily withdrew, ſounding the door as ſhe went out, ſignifying thereby the humour ſhe was in.</p>
                  <p>No change in the condition of affairs took place for ſome days.—Mr. Howard, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with General Mounſey and Capt. Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville, paid Lord Dacie the promiſed viſit; Lord Colville, Lady Colville, Henrietta, and Mrs. Mounſey having gone ſome hours pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious.—In this viſit nothing material happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed until the cloſe of the evening, when Mr. Howard wiſhed to return to town, which was oppoſed in a friendly manner by Lord
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:022876_0060_0FBA9955526D25D8"/>
Dacie, and the Duke and the Dutcheſs of Aſhbridge, upon ſerious grounds, as they expreſſed.—Mr. Howard, upon their entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> conſented to give over his intentions until the next morning.—Wine went round in rather a mercurial revolution, therefore too quick in its motion for the temperate habit of Henry.—After the male characters were warm, and the ladies retired, the Duke propoſed to Mr. Howard a treaty of alliance, not offenſively and defenſively, as ſtates and powers propoſe, but that of father and ſon; in ſhort, an invitation to pay his addreſſes to Lady Ann.—This was a delicate point with Mr. Howard: he was conſcious the lady in queſtion was equal to his expectations; and of perſonage, family, and fortune, to rank with the firſt lady in the kingdom; her youth and beauty could not be diſputed, therefore a ſuitable reply was abſolutely neceſſary.— For a minute he pauſed, and then, with the utmoſt courteſy thanked the noble Duke for the intended honor, but remarked, that there were ſeveral conſiderable matters to be ſettled previous to his being able to ſtate a time wherein he could ſay he was prepared to pay his addreſſes to the lady; as his father, Sir William Howard, was a man of that ſtrictneſs and regularity, that nothing could palliate the crime he would think him guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of, were he to enter into any preliminary without his leave and approbation:—and that he ſhould with pleaſure lay before him
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:022876_0061_0FBA99569AFB2290"/>
the whole of the buſineſs, if his Grace thought proper.—This Mr. Howard conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as a ſure method of parrying for the preſent any ſcheme that might be propoſed; as he had in mind the advice in Miſs Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville's letter, which conjured him to act with caution during his ſtay at Aſhbridge; ſhe being careful of his perſon, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of his ſafety, where Lord Dacie could act without controul.—It may be urged, what could a gentleman of Mr. Howard's rank and fortune fear, when ſurrounded by his friends, at the ſeat of a man of faſhion, a ſmall diſtance from the metropolis?—To this every prudent perſon, who has read of the oddities of Lord Dacie's character (his mind ſtocked with the malignant plants of envy and jealouſy, the latter of which had ſhed its baleful ſeeds in ſuch a prolific ſoil, that it was beyond all ſkill to eradicate the evil) will readily admit, that if they recur to the former occurrences, his ſafety was really doubtful; which will hereafter explain the propriety of the conſtant uſe of the aid of prudence,—for Lord Dacie here put it to the teſt, with an irregular ſubterfuge, by obſerving, that Mr. Howard looked for more weight in the ſcale of Plutus; adding, he was certain Sir William Howard had not the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to abjugate him in every tranſaction, as a living witneſs could teſtify.—On his utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe laſt words, the company were ſomewhat alarmed, by the groſs manner of
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:022876_0062_0FBA995854312C98"/>
Lord Dacie's breach of order, to a ſelect party of his friends;—but Mr. Howard, in a cool determinate voice, requeſted to know the meaning of his pun, adding, in a peremptory tone, it was an improper time to uſe ſuch a ſpecies of language; but he muſt inſiſt on an explanation.—No reply was given by Lord Dacie, but a laugh, with which he ſlunk out of the room.—It was now too late to think of town,—beſides, as the utmoſt harmony had hitherto reigned, Henry was careful to be on the moſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate forms of politeneſs, to continue it.</p>
                  <p>Soon after Lord Dacie returned, and in a light manner wiſhed to retract his words, ſaying, it was but freedom of ſpeech.— The General, caſting his eye on his lordſhip, with a ſarcaſtic ſmile, replied, it was free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, indeed!—Here the affair dropt.— Tea and cards came in ſucceſſion;—the caſt of partners were Mr. Howard and Miſs Colville, Lord Dacie and Miſs Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier, Captain Colville and Lady Anne Cateſby.—This work of chance, as it may be called, in coupling them in this manner, gave Lord Dacie all the ſourneſs he could decently ſupport without an open revolt from honor. —Succeſs dealt to Mr. Howard and his partner in a great meaſure; though nothing very conſiderable was ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded by any of the parties, it was a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſe to raiſe a diſpute;—Miſs Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier alledged an unfair method was practiſed
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:022876_0063_0FBA99599A90E358"/>
in which ſhe was ſeconded by Lord Dacie; —diſcontent ſtalked with gigantic ſtrides, therefore pretexts of the moſt trivial kind were ſufficient incitements;—the amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was marred—upon which the play ended, but not without very loud com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of irregularity, wherein Mr. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard and Miſs Colville were tacit, plainly perceiving, every trifle gave offence.— Mr. Howard got up and walked into the court-yard, but had ſcarce got acroſs before he received the contents of a piſtol in the tip of his ſhoulder, which wounded him in two places, though very ſlightly.</p>
                  <p>The report of the piſtol drew out the male part of the company, who were not afraid of danger, in the foremoſt of whom were Captain Colville and General Mounſey; when, on ſeeing the condition of Mr. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, they were aſtoniſhed to the greateſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and unable to conjecture what could have produced ſo ſtrange an incident,— as Lord Dacie, and all his domeſtics, were within doors at the time.—However, his Lordſhip did not go without cenſure,— notwithſtanding he was (ſeemingly) the moſt ſurpriſed of any perſon preſent;—repeatedly aſking Mr. Howard, what appearance the ruffian or ruffians had, who had ſo Tartar-like aſſaulted him?—Mr. Howard gave the deſcription of a ſoldier, or a man habited as one.—By this time the ladies were made acquainted, by ſome of the affrighted fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:022876_0064_0FBA995B11902F70"/>
male ſervants, that Mr. Howard was ſhot dead!—This tale had nearly proved fatal to Miſs Colville, throwing her into a ſtate of inſenſibility, which was ſucceeded by a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent paroxyſm, in which ſhe called on Mr. Howard's name repeatedly; but through the greateſt attention ſhe was reſtored to her ſenſes, though not before ſeveral hours had elapſed, and ſhe had a ſight of Mr. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, who told her his wounds were ſlight.— During this unhappy ſtir in the family at Aſhbridge, Miſs Dampier and Lord Dacie were both active in the miſery of the night. —Miſs Dampier had a violent convulſion fit on hearing of the accident that befel Mr. Howard, for ſhe ſincerely loved him, and would of courſe (according to the law of love) rather have ſeen him in the grave, than in the arms of another.—Lord Dacie felt ſufficiently, on hearing Miſs Colville at intervals call, in her agony, on the name of Henry, in a rapturous manner;—it was a rack to his very ſoul!—a ſenſation unutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able! for his pain was in the moſt exquiſite degree acute, and grievous to be borne;— but the authors of evil are the greateſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of its malignant influence;—for he who culls poiſon for the diſpatch of others, rarely eſcapes himſelf. In Dacie this max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im was verified; for though God gives his ſun-ſhine and rain to the juſt and unjuſt, yet he has alſo ſaid, "that the worker of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity ſhall periſh by his own ſtratagems."—
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:022876_0065_0FBA995EF5F86FD0"/>
To proceed,—Mr. Howard's wounds, which were very trifling, were dreſſed by a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon procured for that purpoſe, yet a fever was feared as attendant; therefore it was judged neceſſary that he ſhould keep to his room for a few days. To this Henry ſtrongly objected, but was over-ruled, and conſtrained by every perſon preſent; and to preſerve a life of ſuch eminent virtues, it was unanimouſly agreed on, that none of the company ſhould depart until he was able to go to town.—This was General Mounſey's care, for though he left his domeſtics without orders for a ſingle day's abſence, yet his friend bore that eſtimation, that nothing could preclude his utmoſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. In this plan he was moſt heartily ſeconded by Captain Colville, who foreſaw his ſiſter's happineſs exiſted in the ſafety of the worthy Howard, whom he now regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a near relation.</p>
                  <p>Lord Colville and his Lady were very aſſiduous during Mr. Howard's confinement; but the ladies, one and all, conſtantly, notwithſtanding the Doctor's advice to the contrary, kept him company the greateſt part of the time.</p>
                  <p>The affair reſpecting Miſs Dampier and Miſs Colville during this period widened the breach; they were now relations it is true, but no longer friends, for Miſs Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier openly claimed ſomething more than modeſty could produce, or decency can
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:022876_0066_0FBA99609D8B1470"/>
relate, of an intereſt in Mr. Howard; but leſt our readers ſhould be inclined to think him deſerving of cenſure in that reſpect, I ſhall obſerve, Mr. Howard's morals were pure and uncorrupt, never having aſſayed to overſtep the bounds of virtue and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—The ladies were hereupon inclined to think leſs favourable of Miſs Dampier; ſo that her pretext only diſappointed her in thoſe ſteps ſhe took in a moſt unwarrantable aſſertion, to ſecure to her the teſt of truth by a palpable falſehood,—a method that always proves futile.—During thoſe ſtrange ſingularities, a diſagreeable piece of news was ſet forth in all the public papers,—that Mr. Howard had recently been married to Miſs Dampier, and had gone to Aſhbridge to ſolemnize their nuptials, and on the day after was murdered by Lord Dacie's ruffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.—This report in a news-paper preſented itſelf to Sir William Howard, as he ſat down to breakfaſt at Howard-Caſtle.—But who can expreſs the ſurpriſe, vexation, and grief of that truly great and good man!— David on the fall of Abſalom, did not feel more, though their feelings were nearly allied; for Sir William conceived his ſon guilty of rebellion, in entering into ſuch a ſtate without his approbation, and that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Vengeance purſued him for ſuch a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of his duty! It behoves both ſexes ſeriouſly to reflect, that to reject the advice, or to contract marriage without the conſent
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:022876_0067_0FBA9961DCF19F48"/>
and approbation of parents, is a direct vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of God's commandment; and will certainly draw down a puniſhment adequate to ſo enormous a crime. On this occaſion Sir William loſt no time;—day and night forwarded him; ſo that little more than thirty hours, brought him more than two hundred miles.—He never reſted until he alighted at Aſhbridge, enquired for, heard, and ſoon had a ſight of his ſon.—Surpriſe never wore a face of greater appearance of wonder, than on the worthy father and his worthy ſon ſeeing each other; a kind of ſuſpicion of the reality of the ſcene haunted the minds of them both; when the good natured General ſhook the Baronet's hand, and on his requeſt the good man ſhowed the print that had given him ſo much uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, begging to know how much of it was true;—all of which was refuted, to the great ſatisfaction of the father of this amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble young man, who was now able to ſet up, and judged to be out of danger of any feveriſh attack.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as Sir William Howard had heard the whole ſtory, he rendered thanks to the Deity for preſerving the life of his ſon in the hour of danger;—however, the friends of Henry were unanimous in cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring Lord Dacie.—The Duke of Kingſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorough was rigid in his opinion of the diſhonorable turn of his Lordſhip; not concealing his prejudice from the Duke of
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:022876_0068_0FBA996357B91308"/>
Aſhbridge.—It was now the uſual hour in which he daily viſited his nephew; for ſince the accident, he was punctual in his attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to ſecure the ſafety of Henry, until he ſhould be able to remove him to town.— Therefore, the Duke opportunely viſited him in the very hour of his father's arrival.— The Duke was aſtoniſhed at the preſence of Sir William Howard, "Brother," ſaid he,
<q>in the name of wonder, what enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has conjured you hither?</q>
but on Sir William's reply, and a ſight of the news-paper, his ſurpriſe ceaſed in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect; though it increaſed on reading the paragraph. Various were their conjectures; however, it was reſolved upon to trace it, as far as they could, and in the mean time to inſert a contradiction, which was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately attended to. By this time the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival of Sir William Howard was made known to the Duke and Dutcheſs of Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, Lord and Lady Colville, with the other ladies;—a congratulation took place, and a hearty welcome to the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.—In all the happy faces on the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, none was ſo viſibly affected as Miſs Colville's, ſhe poured out her prayers to Heaven, to bleſs her deliverer,—for ſo ſhe always termed Sir William, ſince her ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreck.</p>
                  <p>Happineſs and pleaſure were ſeen in every face at Aſhbridge, on the arrival of Sir William, and the reſtoration of his ſon's
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:022876_0069_0FBA9964D4FEF830"/>
health.—The evening did not paſs without the Duke of Aſhbridge's conference with Sir William Howard on the former particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, which he had opened to Henry, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting Lady Ann his daughter;—it was a ſubject of mature deliberation with Sir William, who therefore propoſed a period to return a categorical anſwer on the ſubject. The next day diſmiſſed all the ſtrangers from Aſhbridge.—Mr. Howard and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther returned to town, with the Duke of Kingſborough;—and although every effort was made to ſilence the public prints, yet a doubt pervaded the town, whether the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was real or fictitious;—but time, that regulator of report, gave the truth to the public in leſs than a month; and Mr. Howard received the compliments of the Speaker, in the Houſe of Commons, on his providential eſcape.—This tranſaction threw an odium on Lord Dacie, that he could by no means efface, to the ſatisfaction of thoſe who had entertained diſadvantageous opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of him.</p>
                  <p>Lord Colville would have willingly broke off the contract, but Lord Dacie and his father perſiſted in having the engagement fulfilled; for the marriage articles between Lord Dacie and Miſs Colville were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared;—a bond, with a condition thereunto written, having been already executed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Lord Colville and the Duke of Aſhbridge, ſubjecting either party to a
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:022876_0070_0FBA9968A04327C0"/>
penalty, to a large amount, which ſhould recede from the condition of ſuch bond:— however, <hi>Six Months</hi> were limited for ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling it, ſo that there were three months yet to come, to determine the point.</p>
                  <p>About this time Mr. Howard became an invalid, having got a new complaint, which ſhowed apparent ſymptoms of a conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive attack. Chalybeate waters were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by the gentlemen of the faculty, and the German Spa deemed the beſt for that purpoſe.—From hence aroſe a moſt pathetic ſcene;—Miſs Colville was inconſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable on receiving the news,—although uttered from the lips of Henry;—every thing in idea magnified to enormity;—the time, though but one year, fixed upon for his reſidence abroad, was with her an age;—ſhe dreaded the impediments which his abſence would inevitably throw in the way of her happineſs; fearing the approach of the time, wherein her father was to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil his engagement, or incur the penalty, as ſtipulated with the Duke of Aſhbridge.— For ten days, which was the term Mr. Howard took to prepare himſelf for his journey to the Continent, Miſs Colville was inceſſantly afflicting herſelf, on their being ſeparated; and foreboded in her mind, that the approaching period was to terminate all the felicity life could afford,—placing an implicit faith in the deluſion of her imagination;—ſo ſtrong are the powers of
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:022876_0071_0FBA996A4A210480"/>
the mind, when a chimerical ſeries of the fictions which the nervous ſyſtem may oft times impoſe, are ſuffered to revolve with the courſe of progreſſive order; from whence may be deduced, the danger of encouraging any of the opponents of reaſon, and much more, thoſe of religion;—for hope is the ſheet anchor of all thoſe, who have faith in the regulating works of an Omnipotent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.—But we muſt make a ſmall allowance for the errors of love,—for it is a ſtrange paſſion, which alternately changes from its intenſe degrees in the zenith, to the nadir of human underſtanding; and overturns all the equipoiſe of reaſon, ſhould ſhe oppoſe the haſty ſtrides of the tyrant.</p>
                  <p>The day too ſoon arrived, which was to ſeparate two perſons, who were really all they ſeemed to be;—doing to none thoſe offices, which they could not with pleaſure receive in return.—Mr. Howard took a dutiful and affectionate leave of his father, who, with General Mounſey, his Lady, Captain Colville, and Miſs Colville, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied him to Dover, that being the route he choſe to Spa.—Thoſe friends hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, all except Henrietta, taken their adieu,—the affecting,—tender,—and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate farewel, was between Henry and Henrietta, love's dominion indeed!—ſighs and tears completely overcame the fortitude and reſignation of thoſe finiſhed charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;—but human nature is not without its
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:022876_0072_0FBA996B94904840"/>
frailty,—which is much better to be trivial and innocent, than the oppoſite extreme of ſo hurtful a contexture.—The wind was fair,—the packet ready,—and only waited for Mr. Howard;—dire neceſſity parted two perſons who ſeemed moulded for each other. So long as the veſſel remained in ſight, Henry continued on deck, looking towards the ſpot where his friends ſtood; during which time, Miſs Colville devoured with her eyes the object of her love;—reſolving, never to admit another to ſupplant him in her heart;—and earneſtly praying to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to preſerve him, and grant his ſafe return;—hoping to effect her eſcape from the ſnares of Lord Dacie, as Sir William Howard and General Mounſey had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, previous to Henry's departure, to uſe their intereſt and influence with Lord Colville, to forego his covenant with the Duke of Aſhbridge.</p>
                  <p>An hour deprived them of all obſervance of the veſſel.—With a ſorrowful counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance Miſs Colville prepared to return with her friends to the Metropolis,—where they arrived early the next day.—Sir William and the General were not unmindful of their word with Miſs Colville, but proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the day following in the buſineſs with her father, in order to emancipate her from the power of Lord Dacie; in which they ſucceeded beyond their moſt ſanguine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations.—The following extraordinary occurrences facilitated the buſineſs.—</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="70" facs="unknown:022876_0073_0FBA996D180CDC40"/>Miſs Dampier had, through her agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mind, brought on a fever, in which ſhe was apprehenſive of the approach of death.—The dread of diſſolution to an awakened ſinner, muſt preſent horror, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the power of deſcription to be deline<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated.—In this hour of trial, Miſs Dampier wiſhed to ſee Mr. Howard, and her offended couſin, Henrietta;—and upon being told of the ſudden departure of the former for the Continent, and of the latter accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying him, under the care and conduct of her friends, ſhe was much affected, more eſpecially as a compunction had attacked her conſcience; and ſhe wiſhed to ſee her aunt Lady Colville, to whom ſhe confeſſed her malefaction in being privy to the attack made on Mr. Howard, at Aſhbridge, though the uſe of fire arms was concealed from her;—but that Lord Dacie was culpable, was without doubt.—She giving reference to the aſſaſſin, he was ſecured, and confeſſed his crime; alledging by way of extenuation, the narrowneſs of his circumſtances, and the largeneſs of the reward of his ſervices, paid by Lord Dacie.—Though to a grovel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling wretch, of ſuch narrow faculties, this might ſeem a palliation for atrocity, yet it did not leſſen the offence.</p>
                  <p>Upon Sir William Howard's being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Lord and Lady Colville, of the whole of this villainous conſpiracy to maim his ſon, as the hireling ſet forth his inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:022876_0074_0FBA996EDB184B68"/>
were to that effect,—the wretch was permitted to eſcape, on condition of his tranſporting himſelf forthwith;—which the worthleſs being the firſt opportunity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with.—As for Lord Dacie, he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly retracted in his pretenſion to Miſs Colville; for his breach of honor and the laws of hoſpitality were more than ſufficient to abrogate any treaty that could have been concluded.—However, by his, and the Duke his father's reſcinding, the bond became void, and was conſequently given up.—No words can expreſs the heart-felt ſatisfaction Miſs Colville experienced on the occaſion;—being thus delivered from bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</p>
                  <p>Miſs Dampier's recovery remained for a long time doubtful, having ſeveral relapſes of the diſorder;—but Providence was pleaſed to lengthen her days, and ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieved her health, but was brought ſo low as to require aſſiſtance to uſe her limbs;— being debilitated exceedingly.—This leſſon brought her to a due ſenſe of her ſtate;— ſhe therefore reſolved to redeem the time, and ſeek for peace and pardon, from the wiſe and good author of her being, to atone for ſuch a black catalogue as her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience held to view;—for the diabolical ſcheme of disfiguring the perſon of Mr. Howard, could anſwer no end whatever; but was the blackeſt work of horrid ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, and an inſtigation of a depravity of heart.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="72" facs="unknown:022876_0075_0FBA997374FF5648"/>By this time a letter from the beloved va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letudinarian was expected,—which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly came to hand, and brought the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able news of his ſafe arrival at Spa.— Sir William Howard was mindful to record the whole of the nouvelle accounts, which he tranſmitted to his ſon;—remarking, that prudence and caution, were, under the care of Heaven, ſtill neceſſary attendants to ſecure him from danger;—for that wicked men, can, in the moſt diſtant na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, find miſcreants, who for gain, would ſtick at nothing that wore the face of prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticability.</p>
                  <p>Captian Colville was very uneaſy on per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving a coolneſs in the Duke of Aſhbridge towards him;—and the manner of the Dutcheſs giving him no opportunity to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with Lady Ann, was almoſt a denial to his paying his devoirs to her, as had been permitted heretofore;—and on his taking his leave of Lady Ann, ſhe with tears re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated the meſſage of her father, which prohibited her the pleaſure of ſeeing him again as a ſuitor;—therefore it muſt not be, except by ſtealth.—This was a thunder-ſtroke to the Captain, who, as heir apparent to his father, Lord Colville, had conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pretenſions, and was in every reſpect on equal terms;—but knowing remonſtrance would not avail, and that the pique aroſe from the denial of his ſiſter to Lord Dacie, he could not heſitate to acknowledge it was
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:022876_0076_0FBA9975D86F89F8"/>
the return of uſage, or what is uſually ſtyled retaliation;—therefore, a literal plan was eſtabliſhed, and the poſt was deputed to retail the meaſure of the tender paſſion; which they had with an ardent ſincerity nouriſhed, and which was truly ſterling in its quality.</p>
                  <p>Lord Dacie being now a marked charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter amongſt all his acquaintance, he found it a ſalutary ſtep to take a trip to the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, until the wonder of the day ſhould ſleep in the minds of the public;—to which plan he conformed,—ſo that a few poſts brought, in the packet received from Mr. Howard, an account of Lord Dacie's ſalutation at Spa.—This was not pleaſing intelligence to any of the friends of Mr. Howard, though they had in recollection the wiſe conduct and prudential ſteps practiſed by him on all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions;—yet, a mind of ſuch an incorrigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtate as Lord Dacie's, muſt naturally lead every reflecting perſon to form a cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique, not to the advantage (as to ſafety) of the former, or to the honor of the latter. Lord Dacie was not clear in his intellects, and ſuppoſing Mr. Howard knew nothing of his former perfidy, ſent him a card of invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, which Mr. Howard returned, with a verbal anſwer,
<q>that he ſhould avoid ſuch meetings, Aſhbridge intended tragedy was ſo recent in his memory, that he could not readily forget the performance.</q>
                     <pb n="74" facs="unknown:022876_0077_0FBA9976F4AA0A58"/>
—and added,
<q>that he ſhould always know the diſguiſe of a baſe mind, though ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayed in the maſk of friendſhip.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This anſwer had the deſired effect; Dacie was rouſed from his lethargic ſlumber;— he was now convinced Mr. Howard was made acquainted with the whole of the plot. —Conviction in his heart pronounced the ſentence of guilt, which in the moſt deprav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of mankind, has its moments of reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; theſe never fail to bring ſhame to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, attended with bitter accuſations of conſcience.—Puſillanimous principles were naturally imbibed by him, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented his calling on Mr. Howard, to excuſe his percuſſion, in ſuch a villainous ſtyle, as he had done; yet to complete his portrait, he wanted courage and ſagacity to direct him, for his counſellor, Miſs Dampier, was abſent, therefore he felt a ſevere loſs in his plots, not being able to bring any of them to maturity;—he of courſe avoided Mr. Howard as much as poſſible;—conſtantly retiring if he ſaw him enter the ſtate, pump, or aſſembly rooms; ſo it was a round of mortifying watchfulneſs, inſtead of recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, during the time he ſtaid at Spa.—The evening previous to his ſetting out for Paris, he ſent Mr. Howard the following letter;

                  <p>Mr. Howard received a ſort of ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on reading Dacie's letter; his conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhowing a compunction that reſulted from a ſenſe of his crimes, and the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtate his wickedneſs had plunged him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.—Though his method to conciliate bore a likeneſs to artifice, yet as there was nothing to accrue from duplicity in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:022876_0079_0FBA9979D744E0F0"/>
Mr. Howard readily gave him what credit, his returning to an orderly habit could claim as its right;—for minds, habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated to the ſincere teſt of regulated truth, are apt to adopt the ſteps prodigality aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes, as though there was merit in acting on principles of integrity.—However, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality of ſentiment is ſo praiſe-worthy, that it only errs in doing good to all, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out examining their pretenſions.</p>
                  <p>During the ſeaſon Mr. Howard was at Spa, nothing was going forward that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited recording, ſaving what follows: Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Colville was reduced to the penny-poſt for all his happineſs,—(Lord Colville hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſired him, on pain of diſpleaſure, to diſcontinue his viſits to Aſhbridge, or its environs) but love often leads children into diſobedience, which in Lady Ann Cateſby and Captain Colville was inſtanced; and if poſſible for degrees of compariſon, to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment their affection—fervour and ardency, were the words of their motto.—A new character muſt now be introduced.—A Mr. Ward, the younger ſon of a nobleman, who had juſt taken upon him ſacred orders of the church, made his appearance, with ſome friends, on a viſit to the Marquis of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedock.—Lady Olivia Beaumont found ſuch an irreſiſtible attraction in the caſſock'd hero, that love's toil was begun.—The out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines of this honorable and reverend cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter were ſuitable to his function;—he
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:022876_0080_0FBA997B52526E00"/>
was young, and in the ſtyle of manhood, very handſome; a ſanguine complexion, piercing black eyes, delectable in aſpect, tall and genteel, his delivery the very eſſence of eloquence; whence the reader may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, he was very ſoon a popular preacher, and did honor to his cloth, by his words and works—which, by the bye, is a good leſſon for his brethren of the gown, for many preach one doctrine and practice another;— this is a glaring error, the notoriety of the fact, many experienced readers will, no doubt admit.</p>
                  <p>This gentleman was a couſin-german to General Mounſey, who was ever an advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate in the cauſe of honor; ſo that Mr. Ward had in him a friend, and a relation of a fixed ſtandard; yet of ſo great a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy was this buſineſs, that a diſparity in fortune made his pretenſions to partake, of a precarious ſtate, for the gown and his family allotment were but barely ſix hundred pound; a year, which with Lady Olivia's ten-thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds per annum on the demiſe of the Marquis, her father, had but a light ſound: but love levels all diſtinctions, for Mr. Ward and Lady Olivia commenced and continued the proceſs of the Paphian God, with truth and ſincerity.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt affairs were thus complexion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Miſs Colville was conſtantly employed in the care of her abſent <hi>beſt beloved,</hi> having

                  <p>This letter had a proper effect on the drooping ſpirits of Miſs Colville;—ſhe returned her anſwer, giving potent reaſons for neglecting to mention the reverend cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter alluded to; however, as Mounſey-Park, in Berkſhire, was the <hi>now</hi> almoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant reſidence of General Mounſey and his Lady, Henrietta was only accommodated with occaſional viſits from Lady Olivia Beaumont; for the hurry of buſtling ſtrife had paſſed to the goal of reſt; every thing ſlumbered into eaſy and natural interregnum of ſilence. The months ſlipt inſenſibly to
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:022876_0084_0FBA998459418F98"/>
the ultimate, upon which Henry was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to his native iſle; and of courſe was expected with joy by all thoſe who had the the pleaſure of Mr. Howard's acquaintance. As for Miſs Dampier, ſhe ſpent her ſolitary hours at Aſhbridge, Lady Colville having forbid her to viſit at Colville-Houſe, ever ſince the fever had left her,—accounting her of too dangerous a diſpoſition to aſſociate with her daughters. Sir James Dampier and his lady were expected to arrive in England in a few months, having reſided in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted ſphere of the repreſentation of Majeſty at one of the Barbarian courts of Africa;— and to the beſt of my recollection, at the imperial court of Morocco. Sir James was a plain honeſt man,—his lady haughty and impatient; and what was the worſt in her compoſition, <hi>Pride</hi> was a <hi>load</hi> under which ſhe could hardly ſupport herſelf;— a burthen that has ruined the happineſs of many of her ſex.</p>
                  <p>In the latter end of September, Mr. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard's time to return was expired, which gave Miſs Colville the very appearance of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent herſelf.—She indulged herſelf with a walk, in company with Lady Olivia Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, to the Park, and in a promiſcuous manner they met with Captain Colville, her brother, accompanied by two other officers of his regiment, a Captain Stewart, and a Lieutenant Pearſon, (both of whom had
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:022876_0085_0FBA9985EF483B98"/>
lately purchaſed their commiſſions) who were very uncouth to ladies of ſuch elevat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rank, which Captain Colville took amiſs, repeatedly informing them, that one lady was his ſiſter, and the other a lady of diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who paid her a viſit.—However, his words were as idle dreams to thoſe ſons of Mars, imagining they were two courtezans, well known to Captain Colville, although in the conduct or appearance of the ladies nothing beſpoke ſuch characters; but ſome of the fops of faſhion, when a cockade is preſented in their hats, ſuppoſe they are at liberty to inſult every fine woman they meet with.</p>
                  <p>The diſturbance created on the Mall, (as the valiant Colville had given repeated proofs of his courage in three ſeveral battles, whilſt Stewart and Pearſon had never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheathed their ſwords, except at a challenge of a puppy, or an incenſed gander, or ſuch like animals) brought together a crowd, in which number of curious perſons, the Rev. Mr. Ward was included.—He readily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognized the ladies, and immediately eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their cauſe;—and in a commanding, ſharp, and manly tone, deſired the heroes of the ſword to withdraw; which, to proceed from a meſſenger of peace, did not come in a palatable manner to be reliſhed by ſuch proud ſtomachs:—the conſequence was, Captain Stewart, as a qualified blood, drew his ſword on the unarmed clergyman, who,
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:022876_0086_0FBA9987555FB1E8"/>
by the help of a cane, parried off the lunge, and inſtantly diſarmed him, to the ſurpriſe and applauſe of all the ſpectators preſent; and then with the cane gave him his deverſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed diſcipline—Meanwhile Captain Colville rattanned Pearſon very ſeverely, who durſt not draw upon a man of ſuch courage and ſkill as he knew the Captain to be poſſeſſed of.—Words can ſcarcely convey the fright and agony ſuch a rencontre naturally threw ſuch timid innocent ladies into;—their ſhrieks and cries prevented Mr. Ward from exacting penance from Captain Stewart, which he otherwiſe would have done.—A conveyance was immediately procured, and the ladies were attended home with ſafety by Captain Colville and Mr. Ward.</p>
                  <p>This ſingular circumſtance had great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence with the Marquis and Marchioneſs of Languedock, who, on the occaſion requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the pleaſure of ſeeing thoſe gentlemen at Pelham-Houſe; this was a favourable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, and the worthies of the day, Mounſey and Colville were not unmindful of their friend; for Mr. Ward was compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by all preſent as a man of honor and a man of reſolution, when neceſſity called for the aſſiſtance of true courage, in a caſe of emergency.—The noble parents of Olivia were charmed with his converſation, for he was poſſeſſed of all the requiſites that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the man in a ſpiritual and temporal ſenſe;—Calumny never could point a dart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="84" facs="unknown:022876_0087_0FBA9988D49856C0"/>
nor Envy exhale a breath, that had, or could ſully his fame.—Mild benevolence ſat ſmiling in his road, for this ſon of the church was what her children ſhould be in manners and morals.—Yet, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his merit, the fickle goddeſs had denied him her boon, therefore little could deſert claim, more than repeated thanks, praiſes, and promiſes of friendſhip.—Here the reader may remark, that this introduction was an inlet to a future familiar intercourſe; for though Mr. Ward had viſited at Pelham-Houſe once before this period, yet he was partly a ſtranger to the noble proprietors.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Ward having done ſuch wonders in the Park, his fame extended to all quarters of the towns;—the rude ſons of war were derided by every diſcerning perſon, and heartily laughed at in their own corps;— to ſhow the world the teſt of their courage, was a thing ſo horrid in the ideas of thoſe ſqueamiſh heroes, that they gave up every pretenſion to it.—But ſome arch wags, who had an aſcendancy over Captain Stewart, adviſed him to vindicate his honor, by ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a challenge to the gownſman who had ſo ſhamefully treated him; alledging that he would certainly decline oppoſing his perſon to the danger of powder and ball; and that by this means he would wipe away the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted ſcandal of puſillanimity.

                  <p>This unexpected reply of Mr. Ward's was a thunder-ſtroke to the fighting Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,—his heart was agitated exceedingly,— and his pulſe beat high,—the fright brought on a fever;—ſo that Mr. Ward was troubled

no further with the gaſconades of the cockade; the newſpapers bore teſtimony of the ſeat of true courage (by publiſhing it)
<q>to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten reſident with men of contraſted em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments.</q>
—The nine days of wonder were over,—and the ſtory ſubſided.</p>
                  <p>Now the time was fully accompliſhed that Mr. Howard ſhould return to England.— Miſs Coville, Sir William Howard, and ſeveral of his neareſt friends, were waiting his arrival with anxiety;—but all ſublunary tranſactions are liable to tranſmutation, for when our thoughts are pregnant with the created plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of hope, which exiſt only in imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the limping ſwollen-eyed hag of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment mars our propoſed happineſs; —cutting off even what we poſſeſſed, from the flattering, yet all-acceptable cozener:— thus human happineſs, at moſt, is in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual habit of uncertainty.—A former let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had given the happy hour in which Mr. Howard was to arrive at Kingſborough-Houſe, in Surry, thither were aſſembled the entire circle of Howardian friends; but who can paint the reverſe of the feſtive ſcene, upon receipt of an expreſs, which gave the aſſembly to underſtand, that an accident of a broken limb, retarded Henry from being able to fulfil his engagement; which acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent proceeded from a haſty ſtep into the pacquet at Oſtend, (that being the way he choſe in his return, being ſhorter by many leagues than by way of France) a ſhattered
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:022876_0090_0FBA9991DDE1A880"/>
leg was the conſequence, the fractured bones threatened an amputation to be neceſſary.— This intelligence threw a gloom on the aſpect of every face preſent,—in Sir Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Howard it excited every feeling of a parent of tenderneſs;—he ſighed, and in his grief offered up fervent prayers to the Deity for the ſafe recovery of his ſon. As for Miſs Colville, her afflictions were beyond meaſure;—every phantom of her mind cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborated the doubtings that oppreſſed her; —a kind of deſpair poſſeſſed her heart, that ſhe ſhould never ſee the object of her love; —therefore only to minds ſuſceptible of the tender paſſion, can be conveyed the diſtreſs of this young lady.</p>
                  <p>Nothing could be deviſed by any of the ladies or gentlemen that compoſed the ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of friends aſſembled, but a reſignation to the will of Heaven, that diſpoſes of all things for the beſt, to anſwer ſome unknown yet wiſe ends; ſo that only in the lap of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, their cares were laid: for all the anxiety that might ariſe in the breaſt of any ſolicitous friend, tended only to corrode with perplexity its poſſeſſor, and rendered no ſervice to the afflicted object of Heaven's viſitation.—To repine is a ſin,—for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation and prayer certainly continues the work of miracles, notwithſtanding what diſaffected caſuiſts have advanced to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall leave this collection of notables

to the contemplation of their friend's ſituation, as in fact it really proved to be a dangerous one:—whilſt we obſerve to the reader, the turn of affairs at the metropolis of France.</p>
                  <p>Lord Dacie, we have already noticed, kept up a continued correſpondence with Mr. Howard, therefore knew the time he had propoſed to return to the land of liberty, and had reſolved, if poſſible, to give him a friendly meeting in London, for which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he prepared his baggage for removal; but had, on the evening preceding his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended route, a curioſity to ſee the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment exhibited by royal appointment in the gardens of Verſailles. But an unhappy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident happened, whereby ſeveral perſons were taken into cuſtody, by the Maréchauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſée of the Lieutenant Criminel at the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telet, for a riot in thoſe gardens; which ſubjects all perſons, of whatever rank or country they may be, who draw ſwords in places of royalty, to an impriſonment of twenty-one years continuance. Amongſt the number accuſed, was the unfortunate Lord Dacie, although his ſword had not left its ſcabbard, and he had only been a ſpectator to the diſorder of the malecontents. —To aſſert his innocence was left to fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture proofs, therefore he was hurried away to priſon, with the other nobleſſe and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, who were the unhappy objects of the arbitrary meaſures of deſpotic power. The Prevoſt of the Baſtille received thoſe perſons
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:022876_0092_0FBA99951CD20958"/>
from the officers of the Chatelet, to whoſe unhappy fate we ſhall leave them, and relate what paſſed elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>The pacquet in which Mr. Howard had taken his paſſage for England, was, by contrary winds forced, when half channel over, in their track for Margate, on the breakers off the town of Helveot Sluys, and every ſoul periſhed; amongſt whom were ſeveral paſſengers of diſtinction.— Hereby we may obſerve, the favours of all bountiful Heaven, whoſe greateſt bleſſings we too often conſtrue into a curſe; ſo much do we prize the ſhort-ſighted infatuation of our ſhallow diſcernments. The friends of Mr. Howard, on hearing the authentic ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the loſs of the pacquet, with the tragic cataſtrophe of the perſons on board, were one and all thankful to the diſpenſation of Heaven, in ordering the leſſer evil to prevent a greater.</p>
                  <p>News arrived of Mr. Howard's ſafety, ſo far as the faculty could conjecture, wherein the fears of amputation, or a fever were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved;—the ſplintered parts were knitted, though as a compound fracture the utmoſt care was neceſſary to guard againſt any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſymptom.—The misfortune of poor Dacie by this time was publicly known, for the news-papers announced the accuſation and puniſhment.—The Duke of Aſhbridge hereupon exerted all his court influence, to find means to extricate his ſon;—but libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration

is not a light word in France;—liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty being a coy lady in that nation, as well as in moſt of the courts on the continent.— By this, diſcontented people may learn, that the poſſeſſion of this Engliſh beauty, is the greateſt bleſſing under Heaven.</p>
                  <p>This affair rendered the court of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don active in demanding a Britiſh ſubject, who in the moſt plauſible point of view, was but a ſpectator to the ſcene of riot the natives had ſolely enacted: to which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance the court of Verſailles attended, and liberated the perſon of Lord Dacie; yet not without manifeſt regret, and wholly granting it as a national favour, rather than acknowledge the innocence of his lordſhip: —ſo much for the happineſs and ſafety of the ſubjects of the grand monarque.</p>
                  <p>During this period, the ſcene of action was chiefly confined to Great-Britain.— The limb of Mr. Howard, which received the accident, now (by ſome alteration in the application) mended but ſlowly; and the neceſſary bandages, and the continued ſituation of an exact poſture, brought on a ſort of an intermitting fever.—This alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſymptom gave Miſs Colville freſh cauſe of uneaſineſs,—which ſhowed itſelf in a manifeſt change in the ſtate of her health, and by the advice of phyſicians, Bath waters were deemed abſolutely neceſſary; to which place, Lord and Lady Colville removed, with their daughter, for that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="91" facs="unknown:022876_0094_0FBA999AB9D82E88"/>The ſprings afforded but little relief, it was the mind that was diſordered, and not any material decay in the body;—but ſo predominant is the power of the faculties of thought over the organs of action, that though the ſprings and order of mechaniſm is in the latter, yet the former compriſes the force, power, and ſpirit, by which they are worked.—Hence we ſhall conclude a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual ſtate of watchfulneſs, in too an elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate caſt of thought, had ſo completely van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed the refreſhment of ſleep, that for ſeveral days and nights the fair penitent knew nothing of the pleaſing deluſion of dreams, being without a deſire to ſlumber. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore opiates were neceſſarily adminiſtered, which took a little effect, and of courſe the ſoporiferous draught was increaſed, which operated ſo powerfully, that an everlaſting ſleep was dreaded as the conſequence; for during an interval of two days and nights, no remedy availed to revive her from a ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pefaction. All this time, Lord and Lady Colville were almoſt frantic, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carded relation, Miſs Dampier, was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſee her couſin; yet her preſence or that of any other viſitant had no effect.— Lady Ann Cateſby and Lady Olivia Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont were exceedingly affected, as were all friends who viſited this amiable young lady.</p>
                  <p>Lord Dacie now arrived from the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and was, with the reſt of the Aſhbridge
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:022876_0095_0FBA999D84E887E0"/>
family at Bath. He ſaw the beautiful object of his once violently heated love;—he was extremely agitated, and felt in his very ſoul the moſt poignant grief for her apparent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. But the only catholicon that can be applied in ſuch caſes had its courſe of application, that is to ſay, the hand of the Omnipotent Power in the working of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;—ſhe by ſlow degrees arrived to a ſtate of ſenſibility, and progreſſively attained the other faculties of Nature.</p>
                  <p>The cynic proverb ſays,
<q>that love is a jeſt, and vows are but wind,</q>
which, in fallacious minds may obtain verification; but in thoſe of exalted nature, where honor keeps the door of faith, it is altogether an erroneous principle. Henrietta loved, and yet held faith ſacred! Lord Dacie loved; and broke his faith!—he ſaw, felt, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged a paſſion, that had led him into ſuch fatal error, and which he had pledged his honor to his friend never to indulge again; —but alas! what are human reſolves?— a blaſt of the impregnated element, and as light as the air itſelf, unleſs it is biaſſed by admonitions of honor and truth, two qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities rarely found in one perſon:—for tho' truth is eſſential to honor, yet honor is no guide to truth; and there is a falſe honor, that is more dangerous than the ſlippery foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed jilt, falſehood. For in what point of view ſhall we take the ſatiated prodigal, if he returns to thoſe vicious courſes, that depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:022876_0096_0FBA999E97480D70"/>
him of all he poſſeſſed, when in the ſtate of his inebriation.</p>
                  <p>If the wretch, reprieved from an ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious termination of his exiſtence, ſhould again by evil practiſes violate thoſe laws which the hand of clemency had releaſed him from the atonement of, do we generally admit that his ſecond offence againſt light, knowledge, and experience, deſerves the ſame mercy, which lengthened his days at a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer period.—I anſwer,—we do not:—for it would be a falſe aphoriſm, founded in er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and muſt tend to the manifeſt injury of ſociety.</p>
                  <p>Who can indulge an unlawful paſſion, and not dread its effects?—for love, if once it can conquer reaſon, is like firing a tenement of faggots,—it cannot be extinguiſhed until all the fuel is exhauſted;—therefore, why ſhould we make light of ſuch a dangerous combuſtion, whoſe exploſion may give us cauſe, too late, to repent of ſuch raſhneſs?</p>
                  <p>Miſs Colville and Mr. Howard were alike in the ſteps they ſlowly mounted to obtain, priſtine vigour.—Great were the adulatory compliments paid by many male viſitants, particularly Lord Dacie, who was now ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted as a converted man; for his munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence to many was ſo conſpicuous, that a cenſure of oſtentation was iſſued forth by the general firm of <hi>every body</hi>;—and, as his compliments with Miſs Colville, came mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a-propos, and was a periſhable evaneſcent,
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:022876_0097_0FBA99A01C8E12E8"/>
—totally an exotic remedy, to gain that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's favourable opinion of his reformed principles,—in that alone was her faith ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted weak: for this doubtful part of the creed of a lady, when a libertine is the ſaint to be canonized, is really good doctrine.— Pray keep in your opinion, and ſtill doubt; for to the daughters of Eve, not in this ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial ſphere dwells a more dangerous mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter than an hypocrite—a wretch that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſes God, to deceive man!—therefore let the convert by his faith ſhow forth his works, that by his works faith may be given to his converſion.</p>
                  <p>Lady Olivia Beaumont found many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies ſince his Lordſhip's return from the continent; he wore ſuch a face of ſanctity, that the Marquis and Marchioneſs of Languedoc were upon all occaſions hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py to ſee his Lordſhip. The worthy perſon of Mr. Ward was his firſt eſſay againſt the doctrine of truth,—but with no great ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs;—this ſon of the prieſthood being more than his match in every reſpect: ſo that his Lordſhip took occaſion to ſhun eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place, where he knew the worthy gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man would be of the party.—Thus by an outward form, to which his inward thoughts were in no wiſe ſuited, this miſtaken man practiſed a new ſpecies of deceit; but to many of thoſe who were acquainted with his former mal-practices, it was obvious to be no more than a veil; though to the reſt of the
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:022876_0098_0FBA99A193087B78"/>
world it was a cloak which covered all the vile nakedneſs of craft and ſubtlety.—In this maſked character his Lordſhip did not fail to write in courſe to Mr. Howard, who was fully ſatisfied of his Lordſhip's ſincerity; and was ſo far wrapped up in his faith, as to intruſt his pacquet for Miſs Colville to the care of this ſon of ſanctity.—But in this ſtep he was certainly wrong, for where deceit has been once practiſed, that perſon ſhould never be tempted to violate the laws of fidelity again.</p>
                  <p>The curioſity ſuch a truſt excited in him, did ſo powerfully work upon his weakneſs, that it was to him an impoſſibility to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the temptation; he therefore formed a reſolve at all events to ſee the contents of the pacquet. Thus he fell to a contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble breach of honor and integrity, betraying the truſt repoſed in him; which could an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer no end whatever, but only to ſhow the frailty of human nature when it became de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved:—ſo that little heed ſhould be given to the returning honeſty of the ſons of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality.—To heal their tainted principles is as much impoſſible, as to reſtore to life the dead corpſe that is in a ſtate of putrefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and it ſhould be a ſettled maxim with the inexperienced of either ſex, to ſhun the company of all thoſe who have led a diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute life; for as it is impoſſible for the leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard to change his ſpots, in like manner is the ſame taſk of impoſſibility to thoſe who
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:022876_0099_0FBA9AA90FBEFD98"/>
pretend reformation, to be freed of their habitual evil practiſes, whenever they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve in the circles of gay ſcenes of life:— for they will certainly fulfil the ſcripture phraſe, "like a dog return to his vomit, or a ſow to wallowing in the mire."—This ſtate will be continued ſo long as eaſe and elegance are worn on the brow of religious appearance.—This is certainly a fatal miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, and a great injury to the cauſe of pure religion, whoſe words and works are ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſincere, and without oſtentatious pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade.</p>
                  <p>The worſt ſtate a man can fall into is to make a mockery of that ſublime ſyſtem which begins at the heart, and reaches up to Heaven, to enter the ears of the omniſcient being, who perceives our moſt inward or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote thoughts; therefore, it is more than madneſs to attempt to act the hypocrite, when our opponent is no leſs a being than God himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Now Lord Dacie having broke the faith, he found the ſecret of Mr. Howard's heart, which was an expreſſion of pure love for Miſs Colville, by which all the former bitterneſs of the ſpirit of rivalſhip revived in his Lordſhip's breaſt; he was therefore reſolved to make the moſt of every oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity: however, he had no confidant, his evil genius directing him ſolely; but he ſoon found out a ſcheme which he put in
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:022876_0100_0FBA9AAA5BCD9590"/>
practice in the following extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                  <p>Miſs Colville did not receive her uſual weekly pacquet, therefore was very unhappy at the neglect of Mr. Howard. Her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures were various upon the occaſion, as ſhe could not ſurmiſe what to impute it to. —Lord Dacie readily conceived the cauſe of that lady's uneaſineſs; he added a forgery to the pacquet committed to his care, by fixing a day, in which he mentioned Mr. Howard would arrive in England; and as he meant to ſurpriſe his friends, requeſted ſhe would meet him at the Devizes, a town on the London road, ſome few miles from Bath; that by his entré unawares, his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and all their friends at Bath, would meet with an agreeable ſurpriſe.</p>
                  <p>This device was framed, as he knew Miſs Colville went out daily in a carriage beyond the verge of the city of Bath.—He ſealed up the pacquet, and had it delivered by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as though he arrived expreſs with it.— The news of this poſt revived the lady, to whom it was directed;—ſhe felt every power aſſume its wonted regulation; ſhe peruſed, digeſted, and then ſeemed amazed at the oddity of Mr. Howard's whim, as the letter repreſented; and as ſhe perceived ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in the difference of the hand-writing, and the ſtyle of the lines which were the counterfeit part, ſhe was ſtagnant in opinion
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:022876_0101_0FBA9AABD1487040"/>
reſpecting it;—however, the conveyance by the poſt, expreſs as ſhe conceived, and his ſeal to it, put it beyond a doubt as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine.—This craft ſucceeded ſo well, that Lord Dacie was preparing all his neceſſary apparatus to put his ſcheme into practice, when he received another pacquet, incloſed in one to himſelf, and directed as before for Miſs Colville.—This he alſo broke open, and found by its contents, that in reality Mr. Howard had determined to return to England, on the very day following that which he had appointed in the pacquet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready delivered, therefore, it made him more vigorous in his plan;—for he found it now wrought up to a pitch of deſperation:— for what was now done, he knew would raiſe a potent enemy in Mr. Howard, and expoſe him to the ſhame and cenſure of the whole nation;—therefore he thought the plan that he had laid down, could he carry it through, and gain his point, the excuſe of an ardent lover would be ſufficient to palliate for the duplicity he might be charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with.—Thus were at one and the ſame time, three grand deceptions carried on by this converted man of honor!—He deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the liberal-minded Mr. Howard,—the charming, innocent fair, Miſs Colville,— and the whole circle of his friends and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance!—He was conſtrained to place confidence in his valet de chambre, whom he bribed to be honeſt, as he called it,—
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:022876_0102_0FBA9AADB2FB6440"/>
and poſted him to look out for a ſhip, bound to the city of Liſbon, or any of the Italian States. As for France, he had received partly his deſerts there, which raiſed in him an implacable hatred for every thing that bore the name of French. This truſty ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant was a Portugueze by birth, therefore fitted to the work he was employed in.— He found a Captain who would ſail the day Lord Dacie propoſed to ſeize his prize,— but would wait a day longer in order to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate his Lordſhip;—as his paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers were to be well paid for, he would ſtrain a point to ſerve himſelf and his friends.</p>
                  <p>The poſt brought a letter to Sir William Howard, announcing the day that Henry hoped to pay his duty to him at Bath.— This diffuſed ſuch a ſpirit of joy in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Baronet, that he could not forbear ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting Miſs Colville with the agreeable intelligence, at which ſhe ſeemed greatly ſurpriſed; yet imagined ſhe was beforehand in her knowledge, and pleaſed herſelf with the agreeable ideas of Mr. Howard's frolic, to ſurpriſe his friends a day ſooner than he was expected; ſhe therefore was amuſing the cognitions of her mind with the pleaſures of idea, letting hope and an exuberant fancy ſport in her boſom, at the proſpect that lay before her.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt ſhe was thus agreeably entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her thoughts, the baſe-minded Lord
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:022876_0103_0FBA9AAEE30EB370"/>
Dacie was getting ready all neceſſaries for his intended elopement. The day at length arrived, and Miſs Colville, though ſhe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined ſhe was in a few hours to ſee the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for whom ſhe wiſhed to live, had a kind of predeſtination of fatality, which affected her ſo much that ſhe fell into tears ſeveral times; this was obſerved by her domeſtics, who were anxious to know her diſorder,— but ſhe waved all direct anſwers. By theſe evaſions her women ſuppoſed her mind to be ſomewhat diſordered, and ſtrenuouſly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her going out that morning;—this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of her ſervants made her in a peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory manner, command ſilence, in which they implicitly obeyed.</p>
                  <p>She no ſooner got into her carriage, than another flood of involuntary tears guſhed from her eyes,—a preſage of a particular change.—The coach went on at a quick pace, but ere ſhe reached Devizes by three miles of the road, it being a loneſome place, no houſes or perſons near, a poſt-chaiſe and four horſes appeared, out of which two men ruſhed with maſks on, and without ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny commanded the coachman to ſtop, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Miſs Colville out of her carriage and thruſting her into the poſt-chaiſe, into which one of them ſtept, whilſt the other rode on horſeback with a loaded blunderbuſs in his hand.—The chaiſe drove off at a great rate, taking the croſs roads, and avoiding the town that was then partly in view, diſtant
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:022876_0104_0FBA9AB207EF7A98"/>
nearly three miles.—Previous to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, they gave the coachman and foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who conducted Miſs Colville, a cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to depart homeward to Bath, on pain of the forfeiture of their lives;—with which they readily complied.</p>
                  <p>Words cannot deſcribe the agony of Miſs Colville!—ſhe ſhrieked out, tore her hair, and in vain called for help, and then fell into a convulſion fit; but the raviſher, who had her now in his cuſtody, had no pity on her cries and lamentations, telling her, on her revival, that as ſhe regarded her life, welfare and ſafety, to forbear making ſuch noiſe;—and endeavoured to ſooth her, by informing her that ſhe ſhould be conducted to a place of ſafety, and find a friend there ready to receive her, who loved and adored her.—She, however received no conſolation from this flattering tale, continuing to vent her grief in torrents of ſhowers, that fell from her lovely eyes;—tears of heated brine of ſorrow, that ſcalded and wounded her beauteous cheeks as they fell.</p>
                  <p>The tyrant was relentleſs, and cloſed up the blinds, not permitting her to leave her ſeat for nearly twenty hours, having provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed neceſſaries for the journey, which were in the carriage.—Of theſe refreſhments the afflicted lady would not partake.—The ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem practiſed on her,—the dangers ſhe had to encounter,—the loſs of Mr. Howard,
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:022876_0105_0FBA9AB45E43A670"/>
—added to thoſe of her friends, were bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens on her mind, not to be eaſily removed, —ſhe therefore ſaw in the terrors of her mind, every ſpecies of villainy practiſed on her,—but how to eſcape ſhe could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe. With theſe diſagreeable reflections ſhe arrived at Black-Wall, near London, and was hurried immediately on board a ſhip, which was then making ready to fall down the river, and was bound on a voyage to Liſbon.</p>
                  <p>No ſooner was ſhe ſeated in the cabin, than the two maſqued men took off their diſguiſes, and in their perſons ſhe perceived, to her utmoſt aſtoniſhment and mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,—Lord Dacie and his valet de chambre! —She was then, if poſſible, more miſerable than before;—ſhe felt every pang redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled; ſhe then readily recollected the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery of the pacquet, and that it really muſt have been intercepted;—ſhe accuſed his Lordſhip with it,—he did not heſitate to own it,—and only ſaid, he thought every ſcheme laudable whereby he could ſecure her in his poſſeſſion;—for he had determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to exiſt without her, and therefore hoped ſhe would make him happy in a few days.—He would give her a week to make up her mind, which, if not favourable to his expectations, he muſt uſe force to make her comply with his deſires, as his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were honorable;—and ſhould as ſoon as they reached the deſtined port, make her
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:022876_0106_0FBA9AB592320138"/>
his wife, according to the ceremonial of the law, and therefore ſhe might reſt aſſured, ſhe was ſafe under his care, and that his perſon and fortune were at her ſervice.—There we ſhall leave them and return to Bath.</p>
                  <p>It would baffle deſcription to ſet forth the ravings of her parents,—her brothers, ſiſter, and Sir William Howard; with the reſt of her friends.—Henry arrived!—His Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietta and his falſe friend Dacie, were both miſſing! He ſtormed, raved, and was in ſuch a frantic plight, as he never experienced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore!—He ſoon diſcovered the cheat and trick played by the deſigning villainy of Dacie! He made the coachman and foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who attended Miſs Colville, relate all the particulars of the uſage of the raviſher. A hue and cry was raiſed! It was all in vain, for no perſon had ſeen a lady of her deſcription, no inn keeper ſaw ſuch travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,—all enquiry was without effect.</p>
                  <p>A week was ſpent in exploring all parts of the kingdom;—advertiſements made their appearance;—all the pacquets to the continent were conſtantly ſearched; every means uſed to find out the retreat of the ſtigmatized Dacie,—all efforts were vain:— ſo that the purſuers teturned to Bath incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolable, and ſorrow pervaded every counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
                  <p>As for Mr. Howard, he wiſhed for death a thouſand times,—but had too great a
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:022876_0107_0FBA9AB72A922D98"/>
dread to offend the Omnipotent Being, to uſe any means to ſhorten an exiſtence, which was given by God, and ſhould therefore be demanded at his good pleaſure:—for of all the catalogue of crimes belonging to ſinful man, none can equal that of ſuicide! It is of ſo daring and preſuming a nature to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe God's will and pleaſure, as to leave no hope of pardon;—for as there is no time on earth for repentance, we are certain in the grave there is none.</p>

                  <p>THE Portugueze ſhip proceeded on her voyage without any material occurrence, until the ſixth day after her departure from England, when the ſea became very rough; and although the veſſel was deeply laden, and kept ſteady of courſe, yet Miſs Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville was ſo much affected by ſea ſickneſs, that her recovery was doubtful.</p>
                  <p>Dord Dacie had hitherto behaved with all the reſpect imaginable, and gave every poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible attendance to render her ſituation as agreeable as could be expected, but her grief was not to be ſoothed;—ſhe pined with inward ſufferings; and had been ſo late
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:022876_0109_0FBA9ABA123B86B8"/>
an invalid, that her conſtitution bore evident marks of declenſion.—About ſun-ſet the breeze abated, and in a few hours it totally ſubſided.—Lord Dacie ſeated himſelf by her bed-ſide in the ſtate-room, and addreſſed Miſs Colville in the following manner.</p>
                  <p>"I perceive you give way to an indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of your grief,—a paſſion, in your preſent ſituation, very unbecoming; but if you perſevere in it, the effects will be of a ſerious conſequence,—for," continued he, "if you mourn the loſs of that ſpiritleſs fellow, Henry Howard, your penchant ſhall be gratified;—he ſhall have your charms, if you are willing to reſign yourſelf to his care in preference to mine;—but this you are to remark, as the teſt of truth, that I ſhall reap thoſe ſweets that were ſo long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for Mr. Howard;—and only two days further conſideration ſhall be granted, in which you are to determine on the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.—The choice is in ſubſtance this,—you muſt at all events yield to my embraces at that period;—if it is willingly performed on your part, I ſhall eſpouſe you in legal form on our arrival at Liſbon, and then return with you to England as my lady:— and conſider, Madam, that my family and fortune are equal to your own, and that you once had conſented to give me your hand; which contract would have been long ſince conſummated, were it not for the ſchemes of your compoſing, as well as thoſe of my cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin,
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:022876_0110_0FBA9ABD9A2A3A18"/>
Miſs Dampier:—for to her I owe the hardſhips I have felt, ever ſince Mr. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard returned from his travels.—But on the other hand, if it is a forced compliance on your part, the conſequence will be this, I ſhall detain you during my pleaſure, and then ſend you home by the firſt veſſel I ſhall find ſuitable for your ſafe conveyance, to that idol of your affections; and no doubt, as he is poſſeſſed of ſo much religion, he will thankfully accept you, and be reſigned to his fate of being comuted, as many men of rank and faſhion often are.—So, Madam," continued Dacie, "you are at liberty to be a wife or a miſtreſs, both of which are free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubmitted to your own choice; whereby a ſtate of future repentance on your own part may be avoided.</p>
                  <p>"I ſhall now withdraw, by to-morrow you will be more recollected in your thoughts, —and as it is now calm weather, I ſhall not diſturb your reſt any longer."—On ſaying theſe words he wiſhed her a good night, and retired to his room on the other ſide of the cabin.</p>
                  <p>This choice, as Lord Dacie had termed it, was more than a dagger to the ſoul of Miſs Colville. She, in deſpair, prayed to the author of her being, to releaſe her from the tyranny of this wicked man, by calling her hence,—as there were no other means, in human probability, to protect her from the loathſome embraces of a man in whom was
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:022876_0111_0FBA9ABFDD72AA70"/>
every ſpecies of villainy;—therefore the names of a wife or miſtreſs, to ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, were equally odious; and whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of a performance to make legal the former appellation, was not to be relied on; at beſt it was ſacrificing herſelf to a ſon of Belial, from whom every evil conſequence was to be feared.</p>
                  <p>She ſpent the night in lamenting her misfortunes, often earneſtly invoking the deity to avert the ruin that ſo nearly threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened her.</p>
                  <p>In the combat of a reſignation to the will of Heaven, the deluſive enemy of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture held out the quick means to avoid ſhame and misfortune, by making her quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus in ſuicide.—This alluring bait was gild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over with the beauties of Roman virtue, and an exaltation of mind, and the uſe of ſuch means when neceſſity required it, with a thouſand ſuggeſtions equally palatable to a mind not fraught with the principles of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt religion;—but in all theſe methods of ſeduction the enemy found nothing in her; and not being able to prevail, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, leaving her to converſe with the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual comforts ſhe received from a ſole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence in a reſigned ſtate on the goodneſs and mercies of God: abhorring in her ſoul the idea of ſelf-murder,—that gloomy mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter that recently hath ſhown his power amongſt Chriſtian nations.—The very op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite power to the beneficence of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:022876_0112_0FBA9AC0D3D1CAA0"/>
of Nature.—For how can a creature, which is compoſed of the duſt of the earth, preſume to diſembody himſelf, to appear naked in the preſence of glorious ſpirits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the throne of grace, with the entire burthen of numberleſs imperfections laid open to view? It is a horrid thought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed! and is the moſt depraved and attroci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous crime man can commit.</p>
                  <p>About ten o'clock in the morning Lord Dacie again waited on Miſs Colville, and by great perſuaſion ſhe ſipped a little tea; not having taken any ſuſtenance, that would vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ſupport human nature, ſince her decoy from Bath, except tea.</p>
                  <p>The day was nearly at a period when Lord Dacie again renewed his ſolicitations to her concerning the propoſed choice.—She mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerved;—that he ſhould grant her time, till the ſhip arrived in the port of her deſtination, to conſider of the matter;—but in this he peremptorily refuſed to comply. —His tenacious diſpoſition made her apply herſelf to reaſon with him, which ſhe did in the following words:</p>
                  <p>"I know, my Lord, I am now in your power, ſo far as a command over my perſon will admit,—but ſurely you will not be ſo cruel to exert that prerogative over a perſon of my ſex, by ſnatching from me the feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of my future exiſtence, in depriving me of a title I prize equally with my life, and which in the fruition can afford you no ſolid
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:022876_0113_0FBA9AC25EDD6DA0"/>
ſatisfaction. Reflect, but for a moment, the offence ſuch a crime would give to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme being, and what deſtruction it will bring down on your head for violating the laws of God and man!—You know the manner in which your wiles allured me from my friends; and although it was an impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſtep in me even to conſent to meet the man whom I thought was to be my huſband, yet a tenderneſs for him, through a perfect knowledge of his honorable principles, made me comply.—The ſtratagem you uſed can never redound to your credit; ſo that on a due conſideration of the aggravated cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of duplicity, that you acted both with me and all the world, I think you cannot do leſs than indulge me with time to make my election on the poſition advanced by you.—Honor calls aloud to you not to violate her ſyſtem in an action ſo repugnant to the laws of human nature, both moral and divine; for even after the rites of the church were performed, it would be time enough to aſk any favour that is in my power to grant. "Pray, therefore," continued ſhe, "for Heaven's ſake don't triumph in my miſery;—but have pity on the feelings of human nature, and do not inſult the reſiſtleſs ſtate I am placed in;—your kindneſs herein ſhall not paſs without grateful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments."—Here tears ſtarted in her eyes, and grief prevented her further utterance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="111" facs="unknown:022876_0114_0FBA9AC3D375D790"/>But the attentive Lord, with a ſullen brow replied, "Madam, it will not avail to try by the art of words to diſſuade me from my purpoſe; for if you and I are in this veſſel on Sunday night, I ſhall accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh my deſires:—the reſt of the rites of honor leave to me.—Your demeanor ſhall, agreeably to my propoſition, enſure you future regard;—for I ſuppoſe you mean to claim protection at Liſbon, if you poſſeſs what I am determined you ſhall not have in your power to plead; for if you are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but once to my bed, that court will not look upon you otherwiſe than as a wife or a miſtreſs.—Here you ſhall not be too crafty for me. Was I to admit this, it would be folly indeed; for I have been at a great deal of pains to bring matters to the preſent criſis, therefore all ſchemes to divert me from my purpoſe will be vague, and anſwer no inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whatever.—So, Madam, deſiſt, and make yourſelf happy;—for nothing on my part ſhall impede it. If you can, make your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf eaſy, until an opportunity ſerves to quiet your ſtings of conſcience,—although with me, I muſt confeſs, it is an idle uſeleſs cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony." He ended here, ſhe rejoined in the moſt pathetic manner to grant her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, alledging, ſhe would not take the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of claiming national protection; (although it was her ſecret intention) but in all her reaſoning and fair promiſes the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted raviſher ſeemed unaffected.—She
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:022876_0115_0FBA9AC5957AE2D8"/>
cried and claimed on her knees his protection and favour; but he remained inexorable, and went aloft, leaving her to her own determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as he ſaid, for no words could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade him to change his brutal purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>The next day paſſed, in which poor Miſs Colville felt all the pangs that a malefactor can feel the day before execution.—Saturday morning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was now approached,—the ſky looked red and lowering,—the face of heaven ſeemed changed,—the winds ſeemed how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and hollow—the ſhip rolled exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly—the wind ſet in to the ſouthward,— upon which the Captain called all hands aloft;—every one did his part with alacrity, they ſaw the winds were determined to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt the point with the watery element.— Preſently vivid flaſhes of lightning rolled along the deck,—the echoing thunders, with dreadful murmurings paſſed through the watery clouds,—the wind in frantic ſport toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſea in mountain heaps, forming vallies at pleaſure;—the loaded ſhip with difficulty went up the limped hill, but with redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled velocity ran down the ſteep declivity, —thus the ſhip and her cargo were become in a few hours the mock and ſport of conteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing elements.</p>
                  <p>Danger with all her terrific attendants made her appearance,—the Captain, in deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, cried out hard weather!—to prayers! —and in the ſame inſtant almoſt, called to lighten the veſſel!—Overboard were hove valuable bales of merchandize.—Death in
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:022876_0116_0FBA9AC706C14750"/>
various forms ſtared every one in the face,— all ſeemed ſtruck with horror at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of that grim-viſaged monarch;—to all he ſeemed terrible, except the amiable Henrietta;—ſhe ſmiled at their danger, and thanked heaven that had changed her ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,—being happy to be in the power of God, in preference to that of vile ſeducing man;—with pleaſure offering up her breath into the hands of the being who had given it.</p>
                  <p>It was the reverſe with Lord Dacie;— in wild diſorder his hair ſtood erect,—he ſaw death as the fell monſter of terror,— he prayed with deſpairing agony,—and in broken accents, with a moſt fearful counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, invoked the God of mercy to forgive his ſinful ſoul. Thus in his humility he craved forgiveneſs from Henrietta for the wrongs he had done her, and alſo for thoſe he intended to perpetrate; and in his ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dying words, ſolemnly vowed, that if the ſhip ſhould outride the ſtorm, he would not attempt to violate the laws of moral recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude;—but that ſhe ſhould be ſafe in his care, and no inſult ever ſhould be offered.</p>
                  <p>The ſtorm after ſome hours abated, and by the appearance of the Sabbath-day reſted from its vigorous fury, and about noon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came perfectly ſerene.</p>
                  <p>Miſs Colville was dubious of the faith ſhe could place in Lord Dacie's promiſes to her, though to witneſs them, he appealed to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;—and whilſt ſhe was ruminating on his
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:022876_0117_0FBA9AC851F78878"/>
words, he came to her bedſide, and with a pleaſant aſpect, gave her notice, that that night was to afford him all that human hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs could beſtow.</p>
                  <p>Theſe words ſtruck her with horror,—ſhe reminded him of his vows to heaven, and to forbear ſuch wickedneſs;—her words were waſted in the air;—he ſaid he had ſworn to fulfil his deſires, and that it was equally as great a ſin to perjure himſelf by the omiſſion, as the commiſſion; and deſired ſhe would not reſiſt: him.—She prayed him earneſtly to think of his words when death was near, and to forego his wicked purpoſes; for that ſhe was come to a determined reſolution, to loſe her honor only with her life; and therefore, if he attempted to force her to a gratification of his unlawful deſires, ſhe would not only reſiſt him, but oppoſe her ſtrength to his, and offenſively maintain her privilege.— She hereupon called the Captain of the veſſel, and craved his protection;—but Lord Dacie's purſe had commanded him already, therefore, in vain were her intreaties; he was deaf to all her complaints,—and as for her threats, he knew they muſt prove abortive, for Dacie's ends obtained, ſet aſide the force of complaint.</p>
                  <p>Now ſeeing every refuge vaniſh, except that of her own breaſt, ſhe was determined to yield only by the force of power;—bravely reſolving, and firmly determining, to periſh in the conflict, rather than pollute her virtue.
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:022876_0118_0FBA9ACBD285AB30"/>
—A principle which every lady of honor ſhould imbibe;—for in defence of God's law, if a life is loſt, the virtuous competitor lives or dies without an imputation of ſin.</p>
                  <p>The clock time-piece ſhowed the fourth hour ſince noon.—Lord Dacie had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, with an evil imprecation, by an oath, that at ſix o'clock he would gain all he wiſhed for;—to which Miſs Colville proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in the preſence of heaven, he ſhould not.—Her words were ſcarcely repeated, when the Captain ſlipt down ſtairs, and on entering the cabin, gave by his countenance ſymptoms of fear equal to thoſe which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared on his brow during the preceding ſtorm.—He ſaid, a corſair was in chaſe of the ſhip;—for a veſſel had juſt now hove in ſight, which had fired a gun to leeward to bring him to;—however, he had crowded all the canvas he could to eſcape. As for themſelves, as Britiſh ſubjects, they would be ſafe no doubt, as all the ſtates of the pirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal infidels were in amity with Great-Britain; —but as for him, and his crew, together with the ſhip and the remainder of the cargo that was ſaved from the ſtorm, would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be the abſolute property of the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, who would make him and his crew ſlaves.</p>
                  <p>The reader may conjecture what were the difference of the feelings of Miſs Colville, contraſted with every other perſon on board. —It ſounded to her as a reprieve from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:022876_0119_0FBA9ACDB52531B0"/>
as ſhe had an uncle who had reſided at Fez, in Morocco, but was now at Algiers, as Plenipotentiary from the Court of Great-Britain;—and added to this, ſhe was certain, on being reported, any of the ſtates would free her.</p>
                  <p>Lord Dacie was petrified, and ſtood aghaſt, quite motionleſs, plainly perceiving her op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the title of being his wife would ſeparate them; and in all probability he ſhould not meet with her again until they returned to England.—His countenance fell, —he lowered his tone,—and in faultering accents begged ſhe would paſs for his wife; which aſſumption (he obſerved) to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans, would preſerve her from inſult.— To this ſhe haſtily replied,—"No, my Lord, I will truſt my perſon with Turks or Heathens, rather than with a perjured wretch, who can claim no ſanctity in any religion;—your heart is corrupt, therefore your words and actions partake too much of its quality;— ſo of all mortals exiſting, you are the moſt deteſtable to me; for even your dying words are not to be regarded."—"But," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined his Lordſhip, "admitting all you ſay to be true,—I don't mean to contradict you, only remain neuter, whilſt I inform the captors of our names, quality and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions—She replied, "Enough of your diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation, I ſhall not hold any converſe with you, but claim their protection."</p>
                  <p>By this time the galley was plainly in
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:022876_0120_0FBA9ACF21087390"/>
ſight, and within a league, bearing down on them with all poſſible expedition.—The Portugueze Captain ſeeing it was impoſſible to eſcape, was laying to for the Algerine to come up with them, as by their flag and pendant it was eaſy to diſtinguiſh what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhe was of, although it was now near the duſk of the evening. The Portugueze ſailors were all pannic ſtruck, finding that ſuch inveterate enemies were to be their maſters.</p>
                  <p>In vain did Fernandez, Lord Dacie's ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, who had procured the means to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave himſelf, by acting in iniquity, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of trepanning Miſs Colville, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore his maſter, to uſe his endeavours to obtain his liberty, as the ſervant of a Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Lord;—His Lord was too buſily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to attend to any thing he ſaid;— whereupon the affrighted wretch fell on his knees before Miſs Colville, imploring her favour and protection, which ſhe promiſed, notwithſtanding his villainy, in conjunction with that of his maſter, was the means to bring her thither.—Even the baſe-minded Captain Cordoza, alſo claimed a ſhare of her favour and protection; although he had an hour before, denied her the like boon, at the greateſt extremity a virtuous mind could poſſibly experience.</p>
                  <p>The galley was now along-ſide the ſhip; the pirates boarded with their uſual ferocity, clapping the Captain and all his crew into
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:022876_0121_0FBA9AD09C2C7A88"/>
irons.—Lord Dacie was taken into cuſtody and Fernandez would have partook of the ſame fate of his countrymen, but Miſs Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville humanely interceded for him, by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leging he was a Britiſh ſubject,—therefore he went with his maſter.</p>
                  <p>The Captain of the galley was an Engliſh Renegado, who had fought under General Mounſey in America, and recollected Miſs Colville to be the General's ſiſter, which was a happy circumſtance; and ſhe therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived all the politeneſs that could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from an apoſtate infidel Captain, who had choſen this life, merely to get a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent booty to enable him to live independent whenever he ſhould think proper to ſteal off to his own country.—But this is a bad ſcheme indeed,—to hazard both ſoul and body for filthy lucre!</p>
                  <p>The Captain of the galley immediately removed Miſs Colville into the cabin of his war ſhip;—he layed before her a variety of preſerved fruits and ſweetmeats, with a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of chocolate and coffee, made in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean manner.—This was a ſeaſonable ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, and the only hearty meal which that lady had eaten ſince ſhe left Bath; for though ſhe drank tea on board Cordoza's ſhip, yet ſhe eat nothing except a biſcuit about noon each day; ſhe was therefore through her late illneſs; and the harraſſed ſtate ſhe had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced, quite reduced to the appearance of a ſkeleton; and might be ſaid to be no
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:022876_0122_0FBA9AD241101070"/>
more than ſkin and bone, notwithſtanding the cruelty exerciſed by Lord Dacie for the completion of his brutal deſires, taking no pity on her reduced ſtate of health.</p>
                  <p>The galley bore away for Algiers with her prize, where we ſhall leave Miſs Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville and Lord Dacie, and return to ſee what went on during this period in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Howard, Captain Colville, and General Mounſey, having ſpent a week, as was before remarked, in a fruitleſs ſearch for Miſs Colville, returned to Bath with all the dejection of ſpirits imaginable. However their gloom, except that of the diſconſolate Henry, was ſoon removed;—but he mourned his mate in ſilence.—Sir William Howard did all he could to conſole his ſon for the irreparable loſs of the accompliſhed Miſs Colville, and by degrees opened his mind to him with reſpect to another choice, naming Lady Ann Cateſby, or Lady Olivia Beaumont. But Mr. Howard knew where their hearts were engaged;—but if they were free, this propoſal at preſent would have no influence on Henry. The impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on already made by virtue and innocence were not eaſily eraſed; the dear image of Henrietta was never out of his mind; and to reflect ſhe was in the arms of ſuch a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of deceit, as he was convinced Lord Dacie was, put him into flights of torment that bordered on inſanity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="120" facs="unknown:022876_0123_0FBA9AD6EEF627E0"/>He at times foſtered a hope in his boſom of the interpoſition of Providence in the favour of innocence,—but he as oft ſcouted the idea; well knowing that the good man is as much, if not more liable to misfortunes than the evil man: for Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence permits, for its own ſecret purpoſes, things to paſs, that in all appearance, to the ſuperficial eye of human nature, is loſs and misfortune.—Yet a benefit ariſes to the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer, that more than ſufficiently compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſates for his vexation in the viſitation of the calamity.—As Mr. Howard was now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more thoughtful, yet reſigned to the decree of Heaven, he mentioned to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a wiſh to return to Howard's caſtle, in Devonſhire, with which Sir William cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully complied.</p>
                  <p>About this time it was known in moſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite circles that Miſs Dampier was pregnant. Such a report in the bon ton goes at the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio of wild fire; few diminiſhing the ſhame or misfortune of their acquaintance,—on the contrary ſwelling the account from one to another, until at laſt it becomes a hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bole of incredence, and ſinks into oblivion, through the means ill-nature had undertaken to ſully the covering of truth. However, here the ſtory could neither add or diminiſh, unleſs ſome ladies might report ſhe was to produce twins or a monſter.—But the real fact was, ſhe was in a few months the mother of a young ſon; and as Sir James, her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:022876_0124_0FBA9AD824E0C008"/>
had never that happineſs, it was a great acquiſition in the family!—Report ſtood tiptoe to know the author of her misfortune, or as others ſtiled it, her fortune; but in this the new-made mother was alſo very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit, for a ſtranger had not been admitted, a friend, and a relation, was the perſon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to partake of her amuſements;— the already execrated Lord Dacie was the cauſe of his relation's increaſe.—This put him up again to receive the diſcipline of tongues:—for one worthleſs man to deſtroy the happineſs of two ladies, and the peace of ſeveral families, was deemed a very capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal offence all over England, which no doubt it was:—and by the ſequel we ſhall find how his thrift turned out.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Ward was now the conſtant and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted viſitant at Feverſham-Houſe, the ſeat of the Marquis of Languedoc.—He ſaw and admired the talents and abilities of the young clergyman, and found out his daughter's inclinations to be fixed on that gentleman; therefore he was reſolved to prove the affection of Mr. Ward, before he made his purpoſe known.</p>
                  <p>About this time he admitted the honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Mr. Ward into his family, as his chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, which was a deſirable ſituation for the accommodation of the lovers,—for every day afforded hours of converſe;—and altho' Lady Olivia was not without a conſiderable
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:022876_0125_0FBA9AD9E7583078"/>
train of admirers, yet no perſon had influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence enough to aſſume the name of rival.</p>
                  <p>A 'Squire Lee, and his ſiſter, who were the ſiſter's children of the Marquis, paid a viſit at Feverſham-Houſe.—The Lady, whoſe name was Arabella, and who was really a fine woman, was poſſeſſed of a fortune of ten thouſand pounds, then in her own hands; —the Marquis therefore judged this a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per opportunity to try the ſincerity of the honorable Chaplain's pretenſions, and in a friendly manner opened the buſineſs to him, by declaring his approbation, if his niece's affection could be obtained, which he had no doubt but Mr. Ward could with aſſidui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty gain; and he ſhould acquaint Miſs Lee to look upon Mr. Charles Ward in quality of a ſuitor in future.—This propoſition ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered Mr. Ward; he was cautious in giving offence, therefore, in reply to the Marquis, he returned him his ſincere thanks, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined his anſwer until he ſhould acquaint his friends of the honor his Lordſhip pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed doing him, to admit him as a relation in his family.</p>
                  <p>The Marquis diſmiſſed the ſubject for the preſent, but in a few days renewed it; when the generous-minded Ward, with a ſincerity that would do honor to a prince, frankly owned he could not accept of the terms his Lordſhip had propoſed;—and that had he ſeen the Lady in queſtion two years ſooner, he ſhould have been happy to have embraced
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:022876_0126_0FBA9ADB15E57418"/>
the opportunity, as ſhe was a Lady of rank, fortune and beauty;—but he muſt confeſs he loved a nearer relation to his Lordſhip, and that Lady was no other than his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:—"And," continued Mr. Ward, "I ſhall openly confeſs, I cannot be happy with any other Lady, were her pretenſions ever ſo great to the high rated trifles of fortune;— for with Lady Olivia, I ſhould be the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt man living, did ſhe but poſſeſs only a covering.—I would have ſooner made known my pretenſions, but the difference in the ſcale of fortune, I judged, would mar them; now, my Lord, I aſſume an equality of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, as by the loſs of my two elder brothers, one of whom died of a decline in the ſouth of France a few days ago, and the other nearly about the ſame time of the like diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, in this kingdom, I am left to claim the honors of my father's title and fortune, whom I preſume you knew."—"Very well" replied the Marquis, "and now," continued he, "you are the Earl of Bellview, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume."—"Yes, my Lord," rejoined Mr. Ward, "I am."—"Well then," ſays the Marquis, "I ſhall let you know the whole of my intentions.</p>
                  <p>"As you were a character which took my attention, I paid particular regard to your conduct;—I found, both by report and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, that my daughter really loved you; —I judged your income was not very large,

I therefore ſchemed the plan of proving your affections for my child, and this was the day I purpoſed to open my mind to you, by offering you my daughter's hand:—for the wretched paſſion of avarice, I thank Heaven, has never had any dominion over me.—As I have but one child, was your income not to produce five pounds, annual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there is enough to ſupport the dignity of my family.—But now, my Lord Bellview, for in future ſo I ſhall call you, you are at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to name the day you are to be my ſon."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Ward, in a polite manner, thanked his Lordſhip, and haſted to relate to Lady Olivia the ſubſtance of their converſation,— as he had not ſeen her ſince the expreſs came with the news of both his brothers death. —The interview no doubt gave both parties ſincere happineſs, to be permitted to aſſure formally, what they ſo long had been ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that is, true lovers;—but the death of ſuch near relations obliged Mr. Ward to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main for three months longer in his preſent ſtate, until the period of mourning was at an end.</p>
                  <p>Captain Colville, during the time that Lord Colville, his father, forbad him to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit Lady Ann Cateſby, was conſtrained to carry on a correſpondence with that Lady in the utmoſt privacy, well convinced of the violence of his father's paſſion, ſhould he know of his diſobedience. He had an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:022876_0128_0FBA9ADE138F4360"/>
of the Lady's affections for him, and had on thoſe grounds imprudently men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to her the practicability of an elope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,—which had ſuch an effect on her principles, that ſhe doubted the Captain's ſincerity for a conſiderable time afterwards. This is a very proper remark to be made by every Lady who has moral rectitude, and a care and regard for her character, to ſhun the man who would propoſe ſuch a hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſcheme; which carries infamy in the very name of it, and ſhows that the woman who conſents to elope under the ſanction of immediate marriage, is no better in her vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous principles, than the miſtreſs who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to go into lodgings, until her ſeducer fulfils his promiſe; which by the bye he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver meant to perform.—<hi>Sans changer comme je fus!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Captain was very much alarmed at the diffidence Lady Ann had aſſumed, in her credence of his ſincerity; he on all occaſions endeavoured to perſuade her of his integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of heart, and that his intentions were to get the marriage rites performed in private, as the family difference had retarded it, the preliminaries whereof had been long ſince ſettled;—but all he could advance had but little influence on Lady Ann,—ſhe was of a contrary compoſition to that of her brother, Lord Dacie;—ſhe was virtuous and dutiful, but very timorous, which was a guard over
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:022876_0129_0FBA9AE127778BD0"/>
her morals, a principle which ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed by the younger part of the ſex; for they cannot be too cautious of the deceits and crafts of the world, eſpecially if a Lady is in poſſeſſion of beauty or fortune, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the attention of the libertine or the fortune-hunter,—two dangerous and deteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able characters.</p>
                  <p>Meanwhile a true account was tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Lady Dampier, to her huſband, from whom ſhe was but juſt come over (for Sir James was a ſecond time appointed reſident at Algiers) of the ſtigma caſt on their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, by the imprudence of their daughter, and the deceit of her nephew, Lord Dacie, whom ſhe had drawn in his true colours, without reſerve;—and in her narrative gave him to underſtand, that the ſhame and odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um brought on their daughter Charlotte was irreparable,—as his Lordſhip had eloped with Miſs Colville, whom he decoyed by ſtratagem:—and entreated Sir James to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to England as ſoon as he could, for on her return home ſhe had found, that by Charlotte's imprudent conduct, his affairs required a ſpeedy rectitude in many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
                  <p>This news came to hand a fews days pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to the return of the Renegado with his prize to Algiers, which had the deſired effect on Sir James, for he immediately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched a meſſenger to England, claiming letters of recall from his embaſſy;—and in
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:022876_0130_0FBA9AE3352316A0"/>
conſequence waited only the return of the meſſenger to fulfil the forms of office pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to his departure for England.</p>
                  <p>His uniform conduct and proper demean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or gained him the countenance and favour of the Dey, who reſpected him very much; and as marks of his approbation and eſteem, made him many valuable preſents. The officers of ſtate, belonging to the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian Court were alſo greatly taken with the manner of Sir James's rectitude, and particularly Benhaded Muſtapha Beg, who was the Abalaroux, or Captain General of the Dey's forces, whoſe galley the Renegado commanded, which had taken the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueze ſhip.</p>
                  <p>The galley arrived with her prize in ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Benhaded Muſtapha Beg, the Captain General, and Sir James Dampier, were then at Oxora, a village three miles from the city of Algiers, on a party of pleaſure, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated merely to entertain Sir James, in terms of friendſhip, prior to his departure for Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; and of conſequence the Captain of the galley was under the neceſſity of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thither all the captives or ranſomers taken in the prize.</p>
                  <p>The Renegado made his appearance with Cordoza and his crew as captives; Miſs Colville, Lord Dacie, and his ſervant Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nandez (at the inſtance of Miſs Colville) as Britiſh ſubjects; who, on the interpoſition
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:022876_0131_0FBA9AE4698BCDA0"/>
of Sir James Dampier, as repreſentative of his Britannic Majeſty, were to be liberated and ſent to England, at the expenſe of the ſtate.</p>
                  <p>The weather being at this ſeaſon very pleaſant in Barbary, the rural retreat of the Mahometan Chieftain was very well laid out to enjoy the luxury of Muſſulmen; for the Haaram or petty Seraglio for the female captives of Chriſtian nations, was in the form of a ſemicircle, cloſe to the rotundity whereof were the apartments of thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy perſons which Providence had permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for his own wiſe purpoſes to fall into the hands of this Infidel Chief. In the interior part, from the radical line which formed the ſegment, was a beautiful garden, which, contrary to the general practice of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans, was laid out in all the art and taſte of European nations. In the middle of this delightful ſpot was a ſmall neat building, in the Ottoman ſtyle, with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected balconies, ſo that the front which formed the piazza, overlooked the platform, which was encloſed by paliſades of curious workmanſhip, which entrance into this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon palace was more difficult than a Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean could conceive; and was merely that captives ſhould, under the parade of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant eunuchs, enter in a pageant to ſet forth the grandeur of this Mahometan Lord.</p>
                  <p>Sir James Dampier and Muſtapha Beg
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:022876_0132_0FBA9AE5D2CBEB90"/>
were at the Balcony when the Captain of the galley entered with his pageant. The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain firſt, and the ranſomers following. Sir James no ſooner caſt his eyes on the priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, than he immediately recognized his niece, Miſs Colville, and the nephew of his Lady, Lord Dacie, who had brought ſhame to his family; he therefore with a ſuitable dignity informed the Lordly General, that the Lady who had paſſed into the portico of inſpection was his niece, and that the Lord who followed the captives was a nephew to Lady Dampier; and gave him a detail of ſuch part of the intelligence which he had received from Europe as he judged material to anſwer his purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Muſtapha Beg was happy to have it in his power to oblige Sir James, and inſtantly diſpatched a meſſenger attendant to bring thither the Lady. On the ſummons of the eunuch, Miſs Colville was petrified with fear, leſt any immodeſt liberty ſhould be taken before ſhe could apply to the court of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers for protection, not knowing where to find her uncle. But the Renegado Captain diſpelled her fears, with an aſſurance that nothing was to be feared from his Lord, for that the Engliſh Ambaſſador was with him, therefore it was a fortunate circumſtance. On hearing this, ſhe with haſte accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the attendant to the preſence chamber, where ſhe was at the door ſaluted by Benha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:022876_0133_0FBA9AE71BD175C0"/>
who retired, that Sir James might have an opportunity of embracing his niece and hear the ſtory of her adventures.—This was a ſignal favour of the utmoſt reſpect from a proud Muſſulman.</p>
                  <p>Sir James received in his arms his niece, and wept over her with different emotions; —firſt, with grief, ſuppoſing her debauched by the vile ſeducer who accompanied her,— and then with joy, on being ſo fortunate as to have it in his power to protect her, and give her every comfort and aſſiſtance, until he ſhould bring her ſafe to her diſconſolate parents,—being convinced, from the amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous diſpoſition of Muſtapha, that had he ſet out for his native country, her tranſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent beauty would have endangered her li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
                  <p>The overjoyed and ſurpriſed Lady dropt quite inſenſible in his arms, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſervices of an attendant eunuch was brought to a ſtate of ſenſibility.—Return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing animation gave her aſtoniſhed ſenſes reaſonable application;—ſhe poured out bleſſings on her dear uncle, who was the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of Heaven, to aſſiſt her in the moſt critical juncture.—She then related the whole ſtory of her extraordinary hiſtory, ſince her return from America, until that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant period; the recital of which drew a ſecond time tears from the manly brow of Sir James; for his feelings were acute, when ſuffering innocence experienced ſuch ſevere
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:022876_0134_0FBA9AE8B59A9860"/>
trials. He joined with his worthy relation in returning thanks to the Omnipreſent Power that protected her from pollution under the dominion of the agent of Satan, who (Miſs Colville found out by the ſervant Fernandez whoſe liberty ſhe ſought to reſtore) had by a large bribe gained over the Renegado Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to report them to be man and wife;— which would afford him an opportunity to accompliſh his wicked deſign on her virtue. As Dacie did not know Sir James had been removed from Fez, by his own choice, to Algiers, therefore at the expenſe of every thing ſacred, the wicked man purpoſed to perpetrate the villainous work he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken;—but the Omniſcient Power fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated his deſired purpoſe, and expoſed all his artful projects, to his utter ſhame and diſgrace.</p>
                  <p>After a long conference, the waiting eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch acquainted his Lord of Sir James's wiſh for his return, which was complied with by his immediate preſence; upon which Sir James gave the ſubſtance of his niece's adventures, and on hearing of it, he in a friendly manner congratulated him and the Lady on her miraculous eſcapes from ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding dangers, and on her arrival at a place of ſafety;—generouſly offering her all the ſervices in his power to beſtow.</p>
                  <p>She, with every acknowledgment thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him for his kind profeſſions of friendſhip,
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:022876_0135_0FBA9AEBDFBD6D60"/>
and in an opportune and ſeaſonable minute, craved the liberty of Cordoza (notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his behaviour to her in the hour of trial and imminent danger) as ſhe had promiſed him ſo to do, in kind compaſſion for his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, he having a wife and ſeveral children dependant on his induſtry,—who muſt pine in want ſhould his aſſiſtance be with-held; —for her ſyſtem was to do good for evil, which in the end anſwered every good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as it was heaping coals of fire on the heads of enemies, and commanded their future friendſhip, with the due ſenſe of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.—She alſo begged the liberty of Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nandez, Lord Dacie's ſervant, to whom ſhe had promiſed her protection, and who was grateful for it, as the intelligence lately given had inſtanced,—for in ſo doing he had incurred the diſpleaſure of his maſter; —yet he was careleſs in that, chooſing to flee from a man whoſe employments would have inevitably made him a ſlave for life, had not the injured innocent Lady, who withſtood the ſhock of combined villainy, and which ſhe ſuſtained with ſurpriſing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, become an advocate for him; and to whoſe benevolent diſpoſition he ſhould be indebted for the term of his natural life,— Miſs Colville having reported the truth that he was a Portugueze.</p>
                  <p>The courteous Mahometan without a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute's heſitation, freely granted her requeſt; and ordered them inſtant liberation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="133" facs="unknown:022876_0136_0FBA9AEE2D0567E8"/>They were conducted to the Muſtapha's preſence, and fell on their knees to return him thanks, which he refuſed, ſaying, "Thank that generous Lady, who fufils the belief your religion requires, in doing good to her enemies, in which character you have both acted your parts, though happily for her without much ſucceſs;—go and retain a due ſenſe of gratitude, learn from a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, a leſſon of true wiſdom, be thankful to the Supreme Being, repent and be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py."—He then diſmiſſed them, but not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had with tears of gratitude, ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thanked a thouſand times, the goodneſs of Miſs Colville. They both of them were conveyed to Portugal, in a veſſel of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed captives, which was then putting to ſea.</p>
                  <p>Lord Dacie was, during this time, in a painful ſtate of ſuſpenſe;—he was quite creſt fallen, on finding his truſty ſervant in iniquity had recanted from his principles, and had not returned.—He was, as all baſe minds are, on the appearance of danger of the moſt trivial conſequence,—mean and grovelling,—ready to worſhip the moſt abject wretch that could ſhow the leaſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
                  <p>The time came that releaſed him from his meditation.—He attended Muſtapha, but what was his ſurpriſe, confuſion, ſhame, terror, and remorſe, on ſeeing Sir James Dampier, his uncle, whoſe daughter he had
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:022876_0137_0FBA9AEF58BF2CB0"/>
debauched! He would have ſunk into a ſtate of annihilation, could his will bring forth wiſhes into works!</p>
                  <p>Sir James, in the ſtyle of a true Briton, aſked him what he thought of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?—the works neceſſary to ſecure a peaceable conſcience here, and a happy ſtate hereafter!—to gain either, he had purſued a wrong method;—but he ſhould help him to purſue another courſe, which in the end would bring him to a due ſenſe of the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation he was under to him.</p>
                  <p>Lord Dacie found by the ſtern aſpect of Sir James, that here his career muſt end!— This guilt brought in accuſation, and for the firſt time, perhaps, in his whole life, he felt the pangs of compunction. His ſilence was an interpretation of the perturbed ſtate of his mind; but Sir James undeceived him in his conjectures, and addreſſed him in theſe words. "Pray, my Lord, which of thoſe Ladies is the real object of your choice,—my daughter or my niece?—I find you are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to be a near relation of mine."—Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, with a downcaſt look, and a ſigh, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, "Sir, I have abuſed your family, it is true, and perhaps would have gone farther, were it not for the accident that prevented me."—"Silence your wicked tongue," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Miſs Colville, "it was not accident that prevented you, nor chance either, but the interpoſition of an inviſible power, whoſe influence only can bring you to an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:022876_0138_0FBA9AF0D29990F0"/>
of what you are.—You have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed my uncle, who has the misfortune to acknowledge your kindred, by ſeducing my couſin Charlotte;—therefore, to atone for your crime, make her your wife, who has now a pledge of your unlawful amour, and then you will palliate only the illegal ſtep you have both taken:—however, aſſimilate the honor due to your progeny."</p>
                  <p>Lord Dacie found that Sir James had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the full particulars of his conduct in England, he therefore was fearful of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,—as cowardice is inſeparable from baſe principles, and in a tone of humble ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation craved his pardon;—and that he would repair as much as in him lay, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury he had done.—Sir James, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that Lord Dacie would not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to perform, but abſolutely ſwear to any thing that ſhould avert for the preſent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment his diſpleaſure, ſeemingly, therefore, acquieſced in the ſolemnity of his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's aſſertions,—finding it of no real ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in the cauſe of his daughter, to enlarge farther upon a ſubject which gave him pain in the recital.—Beſides, Lord Dacie would not have been his choice for a ſon-in-law, had his daughter behaved with prudence and diſcretion.</p>
                  <p>Benhaded Muſtapha Beg, who had left the preſence chamber on the entrance of Lord Dacie, to view and order the diſpoſal of the captives which were brought in by
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:022876_0139_0FBA9AF253C8E548"/>
Captain Maanoka, the Renegado (which was the name given by the barbarians on his converſion, and which implies, "<hi>a reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſinner!</hi>"—A ſingular epithet to be given to a vile, or the vileſt of ſinners, who had renounced his intereſt in the Meſſiah, and had entered into the cabal of Mahomet, the wretched impoſtor, and was an open enemy to moſt Chriſtian nations, in the character of a public robber.—This fellow, who we have before noticed, was an officer in the Britiſh ſervice in America, but through diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt had ſold out and entered himſelf in the liſt of apoſtates in the road to deſtruction, (gain being his only god!) gave the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry directions to the Captain, and had juſt now returned;—who, on finding his friend Sir James Dampier in better ſpirits, wiſhed him joy.</p>
                  <p>The heads of the converſation being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, he gave it as his opinion, that Lord Dacie ſhould, without fail, repair the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace he had brought on ſo worthy a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man as his excellency, the Britiſh Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor was allowed to be, by all ranks in that ſtate; the Ottoman Court having always ratified his requiſitions with ſignal marks of approbation:—the Dey of Algiers, as the tributary of that power, paid him all the reſpect due to his exalted ſtation;—particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly his own merit had enhanced his regard for him beyond the reſpect paid to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:022876_0140_0FBA9AF5312901B8"/>
in that high office, which he then filled with honor to his King and Country.</p>
                  <p>Sir James thanked the generous Algerine for his liberal compliment, that he had with ſuch candour reported, what his merit could in no wiſe claim, but his friendſhip had with ſuch kindneſs beſtowed. Mutual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments paſſed between them. Lord Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, though callous in the ſtate of corrupt principles, gave his honor as a pledge, that on the firſt opportunity he would do that juſtice to Sir James and his family, which his conſcience called aloud to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed;— in ſhort, the hypocrite was never better acted than by his Lordſhip at this juncture.—In his ſoul he was reſolved to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit every tittle he advanced, though he had pawned honor and honeſty for the comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able covering of a good opinion, which was freely granted by Sir James and the noble Algerine.</p>
                  <p>Miſs Colville only remained of the doubtful ſect, as ſhe ſaw the caricature of deceit was of congenial parts and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples with the artful ſchemer:—truly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing was he to be out of his preſent ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a charte blanche preſented to him to be afterwards on his filling it up, atteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,— that a ſingle ſentence of what he now advanced would not be inſerted.—For tho' liberality of ſentiment was her juſt claim, yet ſhe well knew, by woeful experience, that Dacie wanted a cardiac medicine to
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:022876_0141_0FBA9AF74DEE9EB0"/>
perform the regular action of a man, who feared his Maker,—loved his fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or regarded the uſeful laws of civil ſociety.—For all was a chaos,—a very miſt of darkneſs and confuſion in his breaſt, to perform all the caſt of parts which he ought not!</p>
                  <p>Dinner being prepared, the noble Muſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha regaled his friends with all the pompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity and ſtyle of the eaſt; (for the manners of Mahometans, in all nations are nearly alike,) where we ſhall leave them and ſee how affairs went on in Great-Britain.</p>
                  <p>Sir William Howard and his ſon having retired to the family ſeat at Howard's Caſtle, ſpent their time in happy converſe on the mutability of mundane enjoyments; and by oppoſing philoſophy with religion, Sir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam eaſily demonſtrated the theory and practice of both,—when to his ſatisfaction he plainly perceived the near affinity the one had to the other;—for philoſophy, which is a word derived from the Greek, ſignifying a love of wiſdom, is that uſeful ſcience, which comprehends the whole ſyſtem of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, or the duties of human life, common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called ethics.</p>
                  <p>The next thing it comprehends, is the knowledge of the cauſes and effects of things, whether external or internal, in the air, earth, or waters, which may be ſaid to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from natural cauſes, agreeably to the order of creation by the Supreme Being.—
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:022876_0142_0FBA9AF8700025A0"/>
The other part of the ſcience, is in the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſpeculation of the exiſtence of things; by which calculations in the revolution of the Heavenly bodies are made, with other experiments which are commonly called the Phoenomena of Nature.</p>
                  <p>Religion (which is derived from the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, ſignifies the duties of human crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to the Deity, and to their own ſpecies) may be ſubdivided into three parts, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending natural, moral, and revealed.— The firſt was the worſhip of the Gentile world;—the ſecond, by the Jews under the law;—the third to the Chriſtians, through the atonement for ſin by the Meſſiah, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the law is done away, and the world is now under grace, that all who repent of their iniquities and believe, may receive re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion thereof and be ſaved.</p>
                  <p>Thus the good Baronet ſatisfied his ſon of the affinity of philoſophy and religion, which are ſo nearly allied, as to render it impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſeparate them,—therefore, it would enlarge the faculties, and illumine the ideas of the fair ſex, were they to ſtudy theſe grand ſciences, on which all our happineſs here and hereafter ſolely depends;—and as their abilities in comprehenſion, for the moſt part, are ſuperior to that of the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite ſex, there can be no reaſon aſſigned why they ſhould not partake of the ineſtimable bleſſings of thoſe ſtudies, which in the junior, or adult, can be, by aſſiduity, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:022876_0143_0FBA9AF9D6291498"/>
for the moſt part in a few months; —or, at leaſt, ſo much of both, as by application at leiſure hours, a proficiency may be gained, —and then we ſhall have publications of the compoſitions of the fair, in all the abſtruſe principles of ſcience; which are now for the moſt part dogmatized to a mechanic ſtandard;—as, though reaſon and religion were to be dealt out to mankind by a market corporation, with weight, meaſure, ſize, ſhape, colours, and a thouſand et coeteras.—Pray, fair rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, exert your talents, and rival thoſe ſons of nominal learning.</p>
                  <p>At intervals the loſs of Miſs Colville was a recollection in Henry's breaſt, that brought with it all the pangs of a lover's deſpair,— as it may well be ſuppoſed, he conjectured her to be, by this time, the abſolute wife or miſtreſs of his falſe friend;—for the name of a friend had been beſtowed by the liberal-minded Henry, from the period the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Lord aſſumed compunction, until the time Mr. Howard arrived in England, and was undeceived.—Yet he did not withdraw that familiar title; only added a preceding well-adapted word of falſehood to it, by conſtantly ſtiling the abſent Lord his falſe friend.</p>
                  <p>In theſe paroxiſms, Henry's delicate feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were in the extreme of agony wrought to the higheſt pitch of human ſuffering;—yet he did, when thus attacked, avoid his father's

preſence, with a view to keep him from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a partaker of his ſorrows.—Upon thoſe occaſions he oft times went to the projecting ſummit of the precipice, beneath whoſe awful craggy limbs the object of his thoughts was caſt into the boſom of the briny deep; —contemplating on her miraculous eſcape from an enraged element, that in the calm of the morn uſually daſhed with impetuous force againſt the ſhelving teeth of this pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous competitor;—which, in his reverie, gave him a glimpſe of Hope's celeſtial ray, that the power, whoſe care had preſerved her from the dangers of ſuch potent forces, in the time of a mountainous toſſing ſea, when winds and rocks had combined in the utter deſtruction of preſuming mortals, who by their art endeavoured to outride in their wooden walls, the contending elements,— that ſhe alone ſhould be reſtored to the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of ſociety; although experienced perſons, who knew the art of ſteering their naked frames through the ſurfing flood, had taſted the bitterneſs of death, whilſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced timorous female, knew no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to gain a meaſure of the ſhorteſt name through the deluge of ſurrounding ſheets.</p>
                  <p>Theſe cogitations often gained their point, —and ſoothed the lover with providential faith,—that ſtill a door was open to receive the object of his meditation from all the purſuits of deſigning man, aſſiſted by the grand enemy of peace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="142" facs="unknown:022876_0145_0FBA9AFF0E1E9020"/>Thus the mount became a place of ſooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſort,—which to a timorous head would have cauſed a ſpeedy dizzineſs on the horror of the gaping jaws of a thouſand opening clefts, that only ſpring tides gave a moiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their wind-dried fronts.</p>
                  <p>Serious converſation only, had admiſſion between the ſage and his gloomy ſon,—for melancholy had ſo conſtantly attended him, that it was in vain to drive her from the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of her employ;—though Sir William often endeavoured to beguile the tedious hours with cheerful converſe and recreating amuſements, the vicar and phyſician, with other worthy characters aſſiſting; but in this he failed,—for Henry was only a ſpectator, a ſmile not daring to approach his lips,— ſo well had the pallid votary of his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance kept her regulated duty in its courſe.</p>
                  <p>Muſic was always agreeable, if the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſtrain was performed.—In this refining employment Henry engaged many hours of the heavy meaſure of Time's glaſs;—for in this art he was an amateur, and had attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a competent knowledge to dub the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noiſſeur.</p>
                  <p>Thus the days were ſpent in Devon's pleaſant ſhire;—the revolving year going on its circuitous motion with clogged wheels.</p>
                  <p>During this time the Bath meeting diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed:— each family going to their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:022876_0146_0FBA9AFFDD725C50"/>
—Lady Dampier about this time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived her huſband's pacquet, which in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance contained his requeſt to the Britiſh court, for leave to return from his embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage;— but things having received a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent turn ſince her letter to him to return, ſhe therefore with-held it, and at court his requeſt was not known.</p>
                  <p>The ſcandal of the day being more than her Ladyſhip's pride could brook, ſhe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, with her fallen daughter, reſolved again to viſit the African ſhore, to find amongſt infidels, what a Chriſtian country had denied to her daughter; who could claim no excuſe for levity and bare-faced error, in ſtraying from Virtue's track.</p>
                  <p>They embarked for the Barbary ſhore, leaving the young offspring of the prolific pair, (Lord Dacie and Charlotte Dampier) to the care of an experienced nurſe, at Cray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, in Surry, near the ſeat of Sir James Dampier, in that county.—Charlotte on parting with the infant ſhowed a mother's care by her ſorrowful countenance.</p>
                  <p>The weather being fine, and the winds fair, they left ſight of Albion's ſhore with a pleaſant gale; though not without a ſinking ſtate of ſpirits, on reflecting, the land they had juſt loſt ſight of, was their native ſoil; —where a certain ſucceſſion of the comforts of human life might have been had in abundance, had not dire neceſſity obliged them to go in queſt of the like ſolace in a
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:022876_0147_0FBA9B0171FC7688"/>
foreign climate, where the attainment of them was all an uncertainty.—And as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther her Ladyſhip or Charlottle drew any of their happineſs from the ſource of religion, it may be naturally ſuppoſed, they were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much comfort in the proſecution of their voyage:—as, the notion of leaving cares behind, is but a mere idle tale, founded in the theoretical chimera of an inexperienced imagination:—for let it be underſtood, in future, by adventurers who have done wrong in one country, and who fly to another to forget their errors or evil haunting of thought,—that wherever they go for ſuch purpoſes, their minds will accompany them, —and the faithful monitor of the heart, —their conſciences,—conſtantly accuſe them.</p>
                  <p>Captain Colville was on a precarious footing at Aſhbridge.—A young nobleman of family, who bore the title of Lord Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, was much approved of by the Duke and Dutcheſs in the qualifications of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and family; but what met their greateſt approbation was the largeneſs of the income he was in poſſeſſion of;—and although they liked his perſon very much, yet Lady Ann, their daughter, was not of their way of thinking,—for ſhe neither approved of him in that reſpect, or in any of the many quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications he was ſaid to poſſeſs,—as he was too much of her brother's wily craft, to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit her approbation.—He could act the very
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:022876_0148_0FBA9B0307F0D640"/>
faint in public,—but was, in the receptacles of his ſecret retreats, a very lewd and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned character.</p>
                  <p>Lady Ann, although ſhe had treated the Captain rather ſevere, yet was ſatisfied of her having ſufficient provocation, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult he had offered to her virtue, in propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing an elopement;—for though ſhe really loved the ſon of Mars with all the ardency of a prudent lady, yet ſhe had reſolved never to break the commandment of God, by diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying her parents;—or provoke the wrath of Heaven, by violating its holy laws, in making a private match, though it had been with a Monarch, without their entire conſent and approbation;—and had rather, in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their commands, have given her hand, to a perſon of their choice, to be her huſband, though the compliance ſhould make her days miſerable, than run counter, in making her own bargains, without their conſent. But ſhe was ſatisfied of the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her father and mother, in not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing any perſon on her that was not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to her.</p>
                  <p>Lord Fairford paid her a viſit in due form; —but the lady, with an honeſt ſincerity aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured him, it was in vain for him ever to expect a compliance in her, to be ſuitable to his expectations;—therefore it would be adviſeable in him to deſiſt, as his ſolicitations would anſwer no end.</p>
                  <p>His Lordſhip took great offence at the
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:022876_0149_0FBA9B0453144ED0"/>
plain avowal of her Ladyſhip, and in a haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty tone declared his intentions were to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the liberty her father had given him, in paying his devoirs to her;—and added, that women were ſublunary beings, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently liable to a fickle fancy,—and that perſeverance, even by the help of patience, had repeatedly wrought wonders.</p>
                  <p>To this coarſe compliment, her Ladyſhip thankfully acknowledged his elegant ſimile would do honor to the ſex; and further ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ironically,—that ſhe ſuppoſed his taſte and judgment correſponded with the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of his ſentiments. If ſo, it was a pity a nobleman of his accompliſhments did not ſeek for ſome object that was not ſubject to mutability, or under the influence of the planetary ſyſtem;—as in her opinion, the ſtudy of humanity was omitted by modern poliſh, or elſe the diminiſhed worth of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male happineſs would not be overlooked by every pretender to a character of rank.</p>
                  <p>His Lordſhip could hold out no longer, —his heat was viſible—as he perceived the lady had in ſentiment an advantage over him.—He replied in a haſty tone, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he might not be the object of her choice, yet to ſuit his own inclinations, he ſhould repeat his viſits ſo often, as to preclude her an opportunity of receiving the favors of the diſcarded Captain,—alluding to Captain Colville:—"But," continued he, —"if I find that hero is continued in your
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:022876_0150_0FBA9B09122E1938"/>
liſt, I ſhall chaſtiſe the haughty ſpirit that makes him aſſume to be on equal terms with me."</p>
                  <p>Theſe words were uttered with ſuch an affected air of conſequence, as made the prudence of Lady Ann give way to a ſmile of contempt;—informing him, at the ſame time, that Captain Colville was not only on equal terms with him, but with the firſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman in the kingdom, for he had both rank and fortune, added to merit, to warrant his pretenſions;—therefore it was not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſo commendable, in her opinion, for a gentleman to menace an abſent character, who had equal pretenſions in every reſpect to thoſe he could aſſume.</p>
                  <p>Lord Fairford was haſty in his temper, therefore he could not tamely ſubmit to the rebuke of a lady, for the unmanly part he had acted,—but with a ſeeming ſhow of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference, forced a loud laugh,—which gave occaſion to the lady to leave him to his own private thoughts.—This he did not notice, but paid her repeated viſits;—and finding the vanity of his pretenſions, was reſolved to ſhow to his miſtreſs the greatneſs of his ſpirit, that ſhe might not think ſo ſlightly of him, as he perceived plainly, ſhe had on all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions given him to underſtand.—So in the hour of heated imagination, by the aiding aſſiſtance of old hock, he ſent a challenge to Captain Colville, or rather a threatened chaſtiſement, as though he had dominion over him.—The letter was as follows:—

                  <p>This letter was ſent by Captain Colville's ſervant to his Lordſhip,—who was under particular inſtructions to wait for an anſwer. —In this he was diſappointed,—for his
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:022876_0152_0FBA9B0BDDBDB178"/>
Lordſhip, through the effects of his elevating doſe, was conſtrained to lay himſelf down to reſt on his bed, to retrieve, by the aſſiſtance of ſleep, his reaſon and recollection, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the letter was left.</p>
                  <p>The morning gave his Lordſhip an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of reading the ſpirited anſwer of his rival; he was very much perplexed how to manage matters;—and as his name was enrolled in knight-errantry, on taking a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated bumper of brandy, he ſent the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a downright challenge, to meet him the next morning at eight o'clock, with his friend, at an appointed ground.—This was delivered by Lord Fairford's ſervant, by whom the Captain returned a written anſwer, in which he acknowledged the <hi>receipt,</hi> and accepted the <hi>treat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Accordingly Captain Colville called on his brother, General Mounſey, who readily attended him to the ſpot—They waited un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til paſt nine o'clock, and were for returning to town, when Lord Fairford and Captain Thwaites made their appearance in his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's coach, and would have paſſed them, had it not been for Captain Colville, who called loudly to the coachman to ſtop.</p>
                  <p>Lord Fairford and his ſecond came out; —his Lordſhip, in a faltering and ſtammer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing voice endeavoured to apologize for his having kept the Captain and his ſecond ſo long waiting, alledging, his watch was the occaſion; but here Captain Thwaites inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:022876_0153_0FBA9B0D80E88370"/>
him, by ſaying, he underſtood ten o'clock was the appointed hour;—to this his Lordſhip ſtammered as a reply, "he muſt have miſtaken him;"—"however," ſaid General Mounſey, "you are both time enough to kill one, or perhaps both!"</p>
                  <p>By this time the honorable Mr Ward, now the Earl of Bellview, made his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, having heard of the appointment of theſe victims to falſe honor, and joined the antagoniſts and their ſeconds;—when, after a friendly ſalutation, as he was known to all the parties preſent, (and was a relation to the General, as was noticed before) he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired whether or not they had ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the buſineſs they were going about? —To this Captain Colville replied, "My Lord Bellview, the noble Lord who has brought me hither, has given me ſufficient cauſe to vindicate my honor, in ſeeking re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſal, for by his hoſtile invitation, I am to protect, at the hazard of my life, the dignity of my rank;—therefore, as a man of tried courage in the field of glory, I ſcorn to be deemed unworthy of all I aſſume.</p>
                  <p>"This proud Lord, whoſe arrogance is not to be borne with, has, by an unprovo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked inſult defied me.—But I am come here with a determined reſolution to have the ſatisfacton of his oppoſing his life to mine; —and as a lady is the diſputed prize, only with my life ſhall I reſign my pretenſions to her:—and to evade my ſword, will at this

time, to all intents and purpoſes be nuga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and cowardly!"</p>
                  <p>Lord Fairford replied, "you are haſty, Captain Colville;—it was in an hour of ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, at the inſtance of this gentleman, (pointing to Captain Thwaites) I undertook to compoſe a mandatory card, to require your attendance here this day, and do now acknowledge I was in error."</p>
                  <p>Lord Bellview rejoined, "I do not take into conſideration your falſe reaſoning on either ſide,—for the diabolical uſage of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elling ſhould, of all the liſts on record of barbarous chivalry, be the firſt that ſhould be expunged, being repugnant both to the laws of God and man;—for what man of the leaſt ſerious reflection, but muſt ſhudder at the thoughts of being hurried, in the very act of offence, in the real breach of the divine command,—before the throne of a juſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended God!</p>
                  <p>"Is not this an act of more heinous atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, then any of the wrongs for which a juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary court has awarded judgment of death? —For in the latter, a time of repentance, through grace, may be obtained, and a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of hope aſcertained;—but in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer caſe, no ſuch bleſſing can be promiſed; it is a voluntary race to perform the works of the cruel enemy of ſouls,—cutting off the wretch from a means of obtaining peace and pardon, to ſink into the abyſs of deſtruction! —And in our view of the crime it amounts
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:022876_0155_0FBA9B1212BFD5D0"/>
to, againſt the peaceful law of ſociety, the calamity is truly great, for in this deluded notion of ſupporting the empty title of falſe honor, or nominal heroiſm, the moſt worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of the ſons of Adam, may, if he is what is ſtyled a gentleman, that is to ſay, a man of property, call forth a man of integrity, worth, and reſpectability, who may perhaps have an amiable wife and ſeveral children, whoſe ſole hapineſs depends upon the valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble life of this gentleman, and through the miſtaken notion of honor, upon the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of this worthleſs character, be brought to an appointed ſpot, as you both are at this period, and by an exchange of fire, or a thruſt of a ſword, this infatuated, yet amiable gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, is carried home on a bier, lifeleſs, to his family!</p>
                  <p>"The villain eſcapes!—boaſts of his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, or rather ſavage nature,—as he poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes neither the fear of God or man,—and evades the hand of juſtice, for ſo heinous a crime with impunity;—though in fact he is literally the murderer of the fallen victim to this barbarous cuſtom:—leaving a diſconſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late widow, and orphan children, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moan and lament his untimely fate!—Pray therefore, you giddy headed and over heated young men, relinquiſh a purſuit of ſuch ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conſequences — for everlaſting happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or miſery depends on the fall!</p>
                  <p>This ſerious remonſtrance had a good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect upon the duelliſts and their ſeconds;
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:022876_0156_0FBA9B1367377D60"/>
—all of them acknowledging the truth of what Lord Bellview had advanced.—The conſequence was, Lord Fairford aſked Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Colville's pardon, as being the aggreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor;—and in order to ſhow a due ſenſe of the impropriety of his conduct, relinquiſhed the pretenſions he had aſſumed for Lady Ann Cateſby;—promiſing, in the preſence of theſe credible witneſſes, to add his good of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices in forwarding the Captain's happineſs with that lady.</p>
                  <p>Thus was ſtopped the effuſion of blood, which would have been the conſequence, were it not for the timely interpoſition of this reverend and right honorable character. A leſſon not beneath the notice of thoſe ſons of wantonneſs, who ſhed blood to ſatiate a brutal inclination of a fiend-like wiſh of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge!—A ſpark, kindled by the very arch fiend himſelf, which cannot be extinguiſhed without human gore, unleſs a calm friend of peace, with his attention to the heedleſs opponents, forwards a reconciliation.</p>
                  <p>It was a remark of the celebrated Dean Swift,
<q>that when two gamblers fell out, the only way to decide their quarrel, was, like men of ſpirit, by a duel; then if one or both were killed, it was only ridding the world of one or two raſcals.</q>
—<hi>Ne oublie!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The duelliſts, their ſeconds, and the noble peace-maker, retired from the ſpot to their reſpective homes, quite ſatisfied with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:022876_0157_0FBA9B14DF55AAE0"/>
that had taken place;—and which, it is to be hoped, gave them a uſeful memento.</p>
                  <p>Lady Dampier and her daughter arrived at the city of Algiers, the once celebrated city of Carthage, the Queen of Nations, but now of a deſpotic petty Prince, ſtyled the Dey, or Grand Lord,—who is as abſolute over his ſubjects, as though they were a herd of ſwine;—their lives and fortunes being always at his diſpoſal, unleſs he is cautious of the Captains, or Commanders of his bands or troops, who often riſe as conſpirators, cutting off ſuddenly the tyrant for ſome bloody act;—as his word is a law, and his ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers executioners.—Yet every crowned head in Europe, as alſo every ſtate, are more or leſs tributary to this infidel depredator; or elſe their ſubjects feel the fatal effects of ſuch a neglect.</p>
                  <p>This may ſeem ſtrange, that a petty Prince, whoſe dominions is little more than the ſize of a county in England, ſhould keep all the Chriſtian powers in awe!—But to era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the evil, would require no leſs an extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, than to deſtroy the race of this infidel ſect, that ſwarms all over Africa, Aſia, and ſome part of Europe;—for as ſoon as one ſet of theſe marauders are put to the ſword, a like number flock to ſupply their ſtead— for deſperation in fight is their acknowledged diſpoſition.—Added to this,—a chain of theſe Barbarian Lords, called Beys or Begs,
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:022876_0158_0FBA9B16B5E97F98"/>
are ſettled all along the coaſt of the Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean Sea;—therefore can, in a few hours be out at ſea, and in the like time return with their prizes into any of the ports of theſe piratical ſtates, who are always ſo far united, as to aid and aſſiſt againſt Chriſtian powers.</p>
                  <p>Upon Lady Dampier and Charlotte's arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, they were waited on by the proper of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the ſtate, who conducted them, with the uſual formality or ceremonial, on the introduction of perſons of the firſt rank at Court; and were eſcorted ſafe to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel of the Britiſh Ambaſſador, who received them with no leſs joy then ſurpriſe:—Sir James, having at that inſtant, Lord Dacie and Miſs Colville, with other notable cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, at dinner.</p>
                  <p>The ſurpriſe was of the moſt agreeable kind to Miſs Colville,—that ſhe might be aſſured of Lord Dacie's performance of what he had ſo profuſely promiſed, when oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity would ſerve.—The effect of ſurpriſe was on the contrary with his Lordſhip,— he was greatly diſconcerted,—but was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to yield to the ſtroke of his own cunning,—he had no back doors nor ways of eſcape,—he had promiſed, in the preſence of a principal Lord at the Algerine Court, Benhaded,—therefore to reſcind, would endanger his liberty.</p>
                  <p>Lady Dampier was all fury on the ſight of her nephew, and in ſpite of all remonſtrance
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:022876_0159_0FBA9B17E4817968"/>
to the contrary, ſhe loaded him with every vile epithet her paſſion could ſuggeſt,—ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining, he had got beyond any method of retribution to her daughter Charlotte;— ſuppoſing, he had been married to Miſs Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville:—but on her being undeceived, ſhe became more calm.—But Charlotte was ſo affected at ſeeing the perjured Lord, that ſhe ſwooned away, and was ſome time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe recovered.—On her being infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the ſingular adventures of Miſs Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville, ſhe was aſtoniſhed, and contrary to her general practice, thanked heaven for her fortunate eſcape;—but the liberty ſuch an accident left in Lord Dacie's power to do her juſtice, was partly an incitement for her praiſe to heaven for ſo fortunate an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
                  <p>She gave Miſs Colville a ſatisfactory ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the beloved Henry, (whom ſhe, as well as Henrietta once had loved to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction; but finding her endeavours fruitleſs, had combined with Lord Dacie, to aſſaſſinate him, as has been in the former part of this narration fully ſet forth) Miſs Colville was happy to hear of her dear Henry's welfare, and wept for joy on the occaſion.</p>
                  <p>The hurry of the day being over, Lady Dampier and her daughter much fatigued with their voyage, retired to reſt.—Lord Dacie found no place wherein he could enjoy a peaceful hour.—The whole night paſſed without his being able to get any ſleep, to
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:022876_0160_0FBA9B1BD98E6F48"/>
forget his burdens, which were now become ſeriouſly a weighty load;—for he ſaw the hand of a ſupreme power dealt to him the bitters, which he himſelf, had ſo long mixed for others.</p>
                  <p>Early the next morning Sir James Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier was waited on by Benhaded Muſtapha Beg, who, on hearing that the injured young lady was arrived, came on purpoſe to pay his compliments to her and Lady Dampier. —But the moſt material cauſe of his viſit, was to ſee the promiſes of Lord Dacie ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled.</p>
                  <p>After a ceremonial had taken place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Lord Muſtapha and the Ladies, Lord Dacie was ſummoned to attend; and on his introduction, the Algerine informed him, he ſhould be glad to ſee the ceremony of marriage performed by the Ambaſſador's chaplain, which would make his Lordſhip happy in the lady for whom he had heard him expreſs ſuch a ſtrong regard, and which would, according to the Chriſtian laws, make them one fleſh.</p>
                  <p>His Lordſhip found all evaſion would anſwer no end, but to expoſe his principles to a clear view, and his perſon to real dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,—ſo he tamely ſubmitted to the matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial bondage!—A happy ſtate for all thoſe who enter into it, with a true ſenſe of the utility of it,—and the inſtitution is really the work of the Almighty;—therefore it is an honorable ſtate,—which ſhould only be
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:022876_0161_0FBA9B1E03F84FC8"/>
performed by mutual conſent;—for an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the friends or relations of the bride and bridegroom ſhould take place prior to the nuptual ſolemnization;—which, between the couple joined in wedlock, ſhould be pure and diſintereſted.—At leaſt ſo far as avarice is concerned, an unmixed love ſhould be poured out, in which the happy pair ſhould partake alike!—For we daily ſee the fatal effects of forced compliance in this reſpect, and what may well be deemed a Smithfield bargain!—as, to the God of Mammon, <hi>(ſordid intereſt)</hi> are ſacrificed mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes!—The conſequences are too ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, as the annals of Doctor's Commons can ſet forth an abundance of examples.— Parents ſhould be tender, and children duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, then mutual happineſs would enſue.</p>
                  <p>Another great bar to the matrimonial hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in the lower claſs, is the exorbitant ſum a licence amounts to, and of courſe is the cauſe of many wretched proſtitutes, with whoſe abandoned pageantry the ſtreets of the Metropolis are conſtantly thronged.—The legiſlator would do well to deviſe a means to leſſen their number.—To a mind fraught with the fear of God, or the ſhame of man, a life of proſtitution muſt appear moſt odious; —for this ſtep muſt convince the frail fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, who is ſo credulous as to believe a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning man, that ſhe acts directly againſt the laws of God; and is in a ſtate of everlaſting puniſhment, unleſs a true repentance takes
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:022876_0162_0FBA9B1F624E70B0"/>
place; and at the ſame time ſhe is an outcaſt to ſociety,—deſpiſed and abhorred,—a wretch ſubject to diſeaſe and death by the iniquity ſhe follows—carrying evident marks with it of the wrath of heaven for ſuch a breach of God's commandment, and in the words of good Biſhop Cranmer, "a living ſacrifice to the devil."</p>
                  <p>The alteration marriage made in Miſs Dampier, now Lady Dacie, was evident: ſhe ſhowed in her eyes a ſparkling of joy.— All preſent were feſtive,—mirth and good humour cloſed the day;—his Lordſhip throwing off the gloom, every face ſhowed the mark of approbation.—Night cloſed the ſcene,—the riſing day renewed the feſtive board, which a third day cloſed without any accident to affect the tranquillity of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblage.</p>
                  <p>Lord Dacie and his Lady were very ſoon reconciled and happy in each other, for they were of a diſpoſition not many degrees apart; therefore were the more likely to aſſure an agreement in the road of life.—He, by many ſolemn formalities of ſorrow for his paſt offences againſt Miſs Colville, craved her forgiveneſs;—the bountiful lady did not withhold the boon, as ſhe ſaw he was now fixed in the walk of life, and his pretenſions to roam were at an end.</p>
                  <p>Letters of recal arrived by the ſpecial or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Britiſh Court.—Sir James with his Lady, niece, daughter, and his new-made
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:022876_0163_0FBA9B20F0712B38"/>
ſon embarked for England,—In the proſecution of their voyage we ſhall leave them, and ſee what the iſland they were bent to produced previous to their arrival.</p>
                  <p>But this article ſhould not be diſmiſſed without remarking, that notwithſtanding the illiberal ſtigma thrown out on foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of all denominations, by the generality of Britiſh ſubjects, and more eſpecially againſt thoſe who do not profeſs the Chriſtian faith, (for prejudice is of too ſtrong a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to biaſs even principles of benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence!) in the good Lord Benhaded Muſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha, Sir James Dampier and all his family received the moſt pure tokens of friendſhip and liberality;—which in Miſs Colville's delicate ſentiments ſhe expreſſed "ſurpaſſed the boaſt of Chriſtian hoſpitality."</p>
                  <p>The generous Muſtapha parted with his Chriſtian friends with all the viſible marks of regret, and furniſhed them with every neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the voyage; wiſhing them a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous and ſafe return to the country of their deſtination.</p>
                  <p>Sir William Howard and his ſon were now buſied in erecting a monument, ſacred to the memory of the noble Duke of Kingſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough, who was now no more; having reſigned his laſt breath in the preſence of his brother-in-law, Sir William, and of his nephew, Henry Howard, and agreeable to an act of ſettlement a long time previouſly paſſed, the right of ſucceſſion veſted in Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:022876_0164_0FBA9B225EA0B6A8"/>
—who was now the Duke of Kingſbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough.</p>
                  <p>The ſovereign, in conſequence of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemiſhed reputation Henry Howard had ſupported, granted him the order, his uncle the late Duke, had been diſtinguiſhed by; —ſo that the enſign was re-delivered by his Majeſty, who was pleaſed to order an inſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, in which his Grace, Henry, Duke of Kingſborough, received the mark of royal approbation from the hands of the Monarch, as a Knight of the Garter.—A diſtinguiſhed honor was thus conferred on this exalted genius of virtue and religion.</p>
                  <p>The good man is not always happy nor free from cenſure,—and often falls, inſtead of riſing in his circumſtances;—owing to his uſing no acts to trepan the unwary in bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains of advantage and overreaching, and often dies in a priſon.—Whilſt the reverſe is attendant on the wicked man, who uſes every method to increaſe his wealth, wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing honeſty whenever ſhe oppſes his proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects of gain; thriving in all his underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, his ſchemes are ſo deep, and his plans ſo well laid, that nothing comes amiſs; —wallowing in riches, and dying poſſeſſed of coffers filled with gold!</p>
                  <p>This may ſeem ſtrange to the ſuperficial obſerver, who may be impious enough to arraign heaven for ſuch a diſtribution of its favours,—that the object who paid due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to its dictates, is of all men the moſt
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:022876_0165_0FBA9B23D15D8E80"/>
unfortunate;—whilſt the wretch, who hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ever thought of virtue, morality, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or of the duties due to God or man, is the ſucceſsful agent in collecting ſtores and amaſſing wealth!—But, ſerious ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culators, only conſider for one moment, the difference of theſe two men;—one was a good man and died in priſon,—his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience was a faithful monitor,—it did not accuſe him of any flagrant crime,—he had in his breaſt a calm reſignation to the will of heaven, nor was ever known to repine, although he often wanted the neceſſaries of life;—he praiſed the Deity for the paſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings he had beſtowed, and with an enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened hope, through faith, truſted him for all that was to come;—he died as compoſed as though he was falling into a pleaſant ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;—his laſt words were an ejaculation to the throne of grace, to receive his departing ſpirit,—and he cloſed his eyes in charity with all men, having a lively hope of the mercies he was to be a partaker of.</p>
                  <p>The latter end of the bad man, who breathes his laſt in a palace, is quite the reverſe of the dying moments of the good man.—All his parade is nearly ended,— the turn of lawyers and phyſicians are now over,—<hi>a deadly arrow</hi> is placed in death's bow;—the pangs of a tormented ſoul, the never dying worm, conſcience, now ſtares him in the face, accuſing him of all the frauds, acts, and deceptions he has uſed to
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:022876_0166_0FBA9B29357C8910"/>
amaſs his ill-gotten pelf,—and reminding him, that he had never ſpared an hour for ſerious reflection from the buſied ſcenes of his worldly cares, to fix upon a time for repentance!—No, it is true he did not, for death ſent him a ſummons as he was calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the annual account of his intereſts by uſury!—two days more, left him a lifeleſs corpſe;—but before his death, his will was haſtily ſketched,—he left a ſum to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow an hoſpital, but the reſt was deviſed and bequeathed in ſuch terms of ambiguity, that the law will neceſſarily ſwallow up the principal part of it, to aſcertain the right of the claimants. His laſt agonies, as he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the valley of the ſhadow of death, were for the wrongs he had done the good man, who died in priſon,—and by whoſe firſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance he had gained reputation in the world; he, with deſpair, painted on his brow, buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feted by the acuteneſs of the ſtings of death and conſcience, ſighed out his laſt breath, with a declaration of hope having entirely fled!</p>
                  <p>Now which of theſe conditions is the moſt deſirable, or the moſt to be envied? —The reader will pardon this digreſſion, when told it is intended to ſhow the common pictures of every day's exhibition,—which ſhould teach us never to repine at the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Providence has allotted us, but to be diligent to do the beſt we can by honeſt means and methods;—for a bad heart is
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:022876_0167_0FBA9B2A9933D7E0"/>
the ſource of evil actions; therefore an honeſt mind begets an active diſpoſition,— for indolence is an inlet to every vice.</p>
                  <p>The reſignation of Lord Fairford in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Captain Colville, at Aſhbridge, was not a matter of willingneſs in the former,— it was a puſillanimous ſpirit;—he was fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to rouſe the latter, as he ſaw in him a potent competitor, and who he was certain had Lady Ann's affections.</p>
                  <p>He turned his thoughts towards Miſs Lee, the niece of the Marquis of Languedoc, a lady whom we formerly mentioned as a perſon of a conſiderable fortune and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments.—In this purſuit he was not an unſucceſsful adventurer, for the lady counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced his addreſſes, by the order of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis, her uncle, and by the direction of the 'Squire, her brother, ſo that a ſhort courtſhip brought them as forward as thoſe the croſſes of human life had buffeted, who began their courtſhips almoſt three years ſooner;—for there is a ſomething that may intervene, "were our determination to be ever ſo punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,—time and chance happeneth to all men," —as all the other characters of this narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive experienced.</p>
                  <p>The Duke and Dutcheſs of Aſhbridge were now upon better terms with Lord and Lady Colville, judging, that from the appearance of things, their ſon, Lord Dacie and Miſs Colville were by this time man and wife,
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:022876_0168_0FBA9B2C1FEFEB28"/>
though it appeared extraodinary to all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that there was no authentic account of their ſituation:—Although the news-papers of Great-Britain, as alſo thoſe of the moſt general reſort on the continent, were autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized by public advertiſements to ſet forth their deſtination or reſidence, if it could be found out.—However, as yet no news what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever had tranſpired, as Sir James had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched his expreſs from Algiers previous to the arrival of the parties in queſtion, and Lady Dampier and her daughter had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked without knowing the reſult of their voyage;—and as public ſcandal was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centive which made them ſeek an aſylum beyond the ſeas,—it proved a lucky reſolve. —But theſe words, luck, chance, fortune, &amp;c. are not to be explained as they are generally accepted,—for theſe ſynonimous expreſſions for the providence of heaven, muſt be ſuppoſed, and abſolutely conſtrued, as the order, direction, or permiſſion of the Supreme Power.</p>
                  <p>Captain Colville received an invitation from lady Ann's parents, and a permiſſion from his own, to renew the formality of courtſhip;—and things which affected that ſerious buſineſs were ſo nearly got over, that the marriage ſettlements was in its draft for peruſal and amendment;—ſo that the Captain wore a face of proſperity.—Yet it was the determination of the parents of both parties to delay the ſolemnization of their
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:022876_0169_0FBA9B2DB49CEAF8"/>
nuptials, until a true and ſatisfactory ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the perſons miſſing could be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.—<hi>Preſt d'accomplir—Foy pour devoir.</hi>

                  <p>The elegant monument which was erected to the memory of the late Duke of Kingſbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, at Highmeadow, in the church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard of that town, which contained the remains of his Grace, the family vault being near it, (and which was but a mile from Howard's-Caſtle, in Devonſhire,) drew a great many polite families to view it;—as his Grace, Henry, Duke of Kingſborough, was the architect himſelf, and had all the work performed under his immediate inſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and direction.—This employment di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting him a good deal from the melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly habit he had formed ſince he had loſt his dear Henrietta,—a name he never mentioned without a deep ſigh, and a trickling tear ſtealing down his cheek!—So deep and firm had the impreſſion ſunk the dye, that during a life of the greateſt length, the noble Duke could not think of eraſing an imagery view of an object whoſe conduct was the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of envy herſelf!</p>
                  <p>The perſons of taſte and rank who were curious enough to examine the beauties, elegance, and propriety of the recording marble at Highmeadow, were at once ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed, pleaſed and ultimately aſtoniſhed, at the taſte and judgment of the noble conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and architect.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="167" facs="unknown:022876_0170_0FBA9B2F3A324120"/>The ſeaſon being now at the height for rural enjoyment, his Grace ſent letters of invitation to ſeveral of his friends, amongſt whom were the entire family of Lord Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville, including the General;—the Marquis of Languedoc and his family, which of courſe included all the younger branches;—the Duke of Aſhbridge and his family;—the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he wiſhed to ſee, that he might exchange forgiveneſs of any ſuppoſed fault on either ſide, that had cauſed ſuch a ſingular change in his family.</p>
                  <p>The company was very numerous indeed, and all beſtowed many compliments on his Grace's tribute to his deceaſed uncle, in the excellence of the curious work erected to his memory.—The modeſt Duke on every ſuch occaſion denied his ability; but the worthy Baronet diſplayed his properties and talents to the advantage due to his merit, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſically was of the utmoſt value to benefit ſociety in all ranks of life.</p>
                  <p>The weather being remarkably fine, the winds were laid aſleep in the boſom of the ſmooth beguiling glaze of the brackiſh ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,—the ſcaly brood wantoned in the ſlow movement of the pearly flood,—ſcarcely a zephyr whiſpered through the lofty tops of the grove of pines, that overlooked the craggy guardians of Neptune's domain, with an unbounded view of ſea and ſky;— the birds were warbling out their morning carols, extolling the beauties of the ſcene,—
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:022876_0171_0FBA9B30CC2AF1C8"/>
lambs ran friſking round each other, gently ſtraying a ſmall length from their dams;— the cattle were eager at their morning's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt, inſtinctively foreboding the ſouth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of the luminary of day would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the heat more than they could labour under, to crop the flowery variegated ſtems which reared their heads in vegetative pride. —Nature ſeemed leiſurely to put off her mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning attire in the filtered waters of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending dew, whoſe aromatic odours perfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the air with the ſweetneſs of fragrant compoſitions.</p>
                  <p>This was the morn the worthy Baronet and his noble ſon had fixed on, with the approbation of all the notables preſent, to form a ſummer camp along the plain, that took in the little harbour of Bay-Mouth,— in which it was uſual for coaſters to put in, when a calm ſea or contrary winds made it neceſſary for their convenience,—there to lay at anchor in ſafety.—When the creek was gained, all the points of the compaſs could not affect their ſafety,—for it was a dock, locked in from danger;—but the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of obtaining it in boiſterous weather, made many unſkilful mariners ſuffer loſs by the attempt.</p>
                  <p>Marquees were erected,—a parallelogram was ſhaped,—diſtinct ſtreets were formed tranſverſely, ſo that an unobſtructed view of the level ſurface of the extended ſheet was carefully preſerved.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="169" facs="unknown:022876_0172_0FBA9B33C71DF5E0"/>About ten o'clock the little town was completely built;—a diſtant view was beyond deſcription beautifully pictureſque.</p>
                  <p>The azure vaulted roof overſpreading the amethyſt of liquid particles, raiſed in idea ſomething ſuperior to the admired works of nature,—beſpeaking at once the reſidence of the Apologued Genii.—The beautiful ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of the canvaſs walls,—and its more beautiful female inhabitants, with its gay males, made the Duke's encampment look like the land of enchantment;—for it made its appearance, and poſſeſſed its inhabitants in ſo ſhort a ſpace of time, as made the honeſt ruſtics ſtand aloof, rubing their eyes, queſtioning the reality of the ſcene.</p>
                  <p>The day advanced with ſmiles to the ſouthweſt declivity of Sol's beſpangled path, and on removal of the dining covers, the charms of muſic enchanted all around, and diſcord with her briſtly young, made a quick deceſſion; for concord and her heaven-born offspring fancifully played their aerial tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, whilſt echo anſwered to encore:— and on the downy wings of the breathing offspring of time, were pleaſing thrills carried along the glaſſy ſurface of the ſilent deep.—<hi>Tout vient de dieu.</hi>

                  <p>In this elyſian hour of ſoft ſoothing into forgetfulneſs, a ſhip in full rigged trim, juſt had hove in ſight, and turning the point of the jutting promontory, ſeemed to want

the aid of the gentle blaſts of Boreas to plough the furrow of the yielding tide.—Her royals were ſet,—every wing was expanded to aſſiſt her to catch the fleeting gale,—but all her efforts ſeemed to fall ſhort of the neceſſary ſupply;—and the friendly tide that drifted his ſheets along the ſhore, only aſſiſted the floating caſtle.</p>
                  <p>By this time ſhe reached the entrance of the ſecure harbour of Bay-Mouth, reſolving there to paſs the night, and the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning proceed up the channel.—The tars were buſied in their neceſſary employ,—the bower anchor dropt, and in five minutes ſpace, ſhe reſted ſafe within the verge of land's protection.</p>
                  <p>The ſea-ſick paſſengers were ſtruck with the enchanting ſounds of harmony's aſſembly, and haſted from their hard beds to aſcend the ſteps of the cabin.</p>
                  <p>The firſt who ſtood on deck was Sir James Dampier, the next Lord Dacie, and then the ladies followed; but what words can paint the aſtoniſhment of the ſea voyagers, when they recognized the manſion of How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard's-Caſtle.</p>

                     <pb n="172" facs="unknown:022876_0175_0FBA9B381C0DD6C8"/>The noble Henry took the fair partner of his ſoul into his tent;—but as the ſea had made her health yield to a temporary indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, it was judged neceſſary that ſhe ſhould, as well as the reſt of her company who had debarked, retire to the manſion, to take the refreſhment of ſleep on the ſettled ſolidity of terra firma.</p>
                  <p>It was a matter of curious inveſtigation, the means by which Lord Dacie was enſnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.—His parents ſeemed mightily pleaſed that he had it in his power to heal the wounds the family reputation had ſuſtained.—The noble Henry ſhook his Lordſhip's hand and wiſhed him joy!—at this the crowding ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators were ſurpriſed:—His Lordſhip would have coined a form of words, to palliate the courſe his villainy had taken;—but to the generous Duke a repetition of the errors of human life was a painful ſenſation.—He po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litely entreated his Lordſhip to repeat no griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances,—that with the works, their remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance was forgotten, oblivion having enve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loped all traces of their exiſtence.</p>
                  <p>An univerſal approbation of the liberal minded Duke's method of forgetting inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries on granting forgiveneſs then ſucceeded; —peace and harmony walked hand in hand to conduct the well paired couples to the caſtle of hoſpitality;—where ſincerity, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and beneficence, ſat at the door ready to receive the gueſts.</p>
                  <p>The next day the ſcene opened with the
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:022876_0176_0FBA9B39A91B0E58"/>
approbation of prudence, on the re-inforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of content and happineſs.</p>
                  <p>Sir William Howard addreſſed the ſeniors of the aſſembly,—who one and all coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided in his opinion, that an union between the junior matched ladies and gentlemen, ſhould take place in a few days.—The firſt couple who received the addreſs were, the long afflicted pair, his Grace the Duke of Kingſborough and the honorable Miſs Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietta Colville;—with a ſalute of acquieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence the happy, happy pair, gave notice of their readineſs to comply.—The honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Captain Colville, and the right honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Lady Ann Cateſby were the next.</p>
                  <p>Then the right honorable and reverend Earl of Bellview, and the right honorable Lady Olivia Beaumont.—The right honorable Lord Fairford and the honorable Miſs Lee were the fourth and laſt whoſe aſſent were requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.—All of theſe, well-paired happy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were content to attend at the altar.</p>
                  <p>The neceſſary documents were tranſmitted to the metropolis,—ſpecial licences were procured,—and after a few days delay, the ſeveral perſons abovementioned attended the ſolemn ritual ceremony, and became of the neareſt kindred to each other.—The connu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bial knot was tied by each pair in ſucceeding order;—the neighbouring villagers partook of the feſtivity;—Hogſheads of elevating drink, and barrels of ſound rectified liquors, with proviſions in plenty were provided, as
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:022876_0177_0FBA9B3B1BFFB980"/>
the beveridge of the populace;—the bells rang a joyful peal;—muſic echoed through the glade and adjacent groves;—bonfires and illuminations crowned the night;—and Howard's-Caſtle conſummated the happineſs of Wedlock.—The ſucceeding day uſhered forth the honorable appellation of man and wife, between four new made couples;—and we may alſo venture to ſay a fifth—for Lord and Lady Dacie, were then but in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond moon.</p>
                  <p>Thus the ſport of time became the ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous work of completion;—and in the full ſcope of imagination, we may indulge our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a little, in reviewing the truly happy ſtate of ten ladies and ten gentlemen of rank and fortune.</p>
                  <p>A fortnight had nearly elapſed before any of the aſſembly counted the days,—ſo eaſy did time ſteal on the wings of pleaſure and contentment, who were united to lull the group from thoughts of care.</p>
                  <p>A day was appointed for the collection of friendſhip's numbers to diſperſe,—but prior to their ſeparation, an excurſion on the ſmooth ſettled ſheet of the ocean, in a large barge conſtructed on purpoſe for coaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing jaunts of pleaſure and recreation, was propoſed.</p>
                  <p>The day arrived,—the aged perſons who were of this notable aſſembly, did not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the entertainment on the water,— they choſe the ſafety of firm ſooting;—and in land vehicles purſued the pleaſures of the
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:022876_0178_0FBA9B3EB1299240"/>
day,—and all parties were to meet at an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed place of rendezvous;—a cold col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and the canvaſs coverings of the tent equipage, were ſent before.</p>
                  <p>The morning was remarkably ſerene,—a ſolemn ſilence reigned over the face of the deep,—all nature ſeemed huſhed in drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy ſlumbers;—no noiſe ventured to wing its courſe in any direction,—a ſtill ſolemnity ſat to judge the events of the day.—The ſun aſcended from his watery pillow with a drowſy appearance, as though he was bloated with the intemperance of the night;—his bright golden locks ſeemed tinged with ſingy red;—the azure roof was vineer'd with ſtreaks of pale reflecting tumors partaking of a watery galaxy;—no one preſent profeſſed prognoſtication from the appearance of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,—for every one was intent on the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of preparation.</p>
                  <p>About eight o'clock in the morning, on Thurſday the 29th day of July, the ten new married perſons, with general Mounſey and his lady, and a ſet of neceſſary attendants to work the barge, embarked with alacrity on board the pleaſure boat, which was decora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with taſte and elegance by and under the order and direction of his Grace the Duke of Kingſborough.—The tide with gentle ſhift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſiſted their endeavours;—and with an eaſy ſail, ſlow in motion, they quitted Bay-Mouth Harbour.</p>
                  <p>The Duke and Dutcheſs of Aſhbridge,—
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:022876_0179_0FBA9B413AF99478"/>
Lord and Lady Colville,—the Marquis of Languedoc, and his Marchioneſs,— Sir James Dampier and his Lady,—and Sir William Howard, accompanied by 'Squire Lee, (who did not much approve of the watery element) took open carriages that gave them a conſtant view of the barge, which by mutual agreement, was to keep in ſight of the ſhore.</p>
                  <p>Thus equipt, the debarkation and alight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was to be preciſely at four o'clock in the afternoon.—The next day at that hour was the time appointed for their return.</p>
                  <p>The day was pleaſant at the hour of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out,—everyone was pleaſed with the proſpect of the pleaſures of it.—Views from ſea and land were equally delightful;— every angle of the ſhelving ſhore ſhowed ſomething of a different proſpect, to that which a few minutes before had opened to the view.—Meandering brooks,—purling rills, ſhady groves—flowery valleys,—wooded copſes,—craggy ſummits of weathered beaten rocks,—thus the variegated face of nature ſhowed its rural and natural appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
                  <p>Anon the ſhow of art, induſtry, and toil. —The new mown fields—the yellow beds of thriving grain,—the ripened vegetable root, ſhowed by its ſtem the mature ſtate it enjoyed;—with theſe might be viewed the neat, ſnug, and well-built farm-houſe, with the convenient yard adjoining,—the domeſtic
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:022876_0180_0FBA9B429D76CD08"/>
animals with buſy care ſeeking their food in receptacles of their wonted uſage.—The cattle in peaceful plenty enjoying the ſpoils of nature's ſpontaneous herbage; —the ſheep in wandering flocks on the ſweet taſted verges of the bounded plain, cropping the honey-ſuckle,—the arch-notioned goat aſcending the ſteep ridge of the almoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular mount, where rocks ledging as ſteps, ſerve the turn of the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing beaſt's clambering diſpoſition to nip the bitter herbage of the craggy precipices, which in his taſte is delightfully palatable.— The laborious horſes are with a ſervile con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordance yoked, and harneſſed to the loaded team waggon.—The early farmer and his ſturdy aſſiſtants are with their brawny limbs, expoſed to the inſults of the weather, at the various employments of reaping, mowing, binding, pitching, or ſtacking of the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous productions of harveſt's extenſive toils.</p>
                  <p>The ſhifting ſcenes affording a wide field for inſtructive leſſons to the idle and diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute.—To ſee the laborious cares that were neceſſary to beſtow, to foſter the productions of the prolific furrowed land, ſo as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them ready for the uſe of the mincing epicurean!—ſhould not thoſe labouring ſons of the plough, be honored as the firſt in arts?—Their ſcience is of comfortable reflection;—tranſpoſing the weak leaſ of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing graſs in November's ſnowing reign, to the fine contexture of the wheaten leaf of
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:022876_0181_0FBA9B44112C9758"/>
July.—The calf of March to the ſirloin of Chriſtmas,—with many other branches equally uſeful and indiſpenſibly neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>Theſe proſpects pleaſed the eye, and gave an agreeable alluſion to active life, in the parties that were travelling both by ſea and land;—who paſſed near four hours in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing confabulation.—The ſea voyagers, as we may ſtyle them, were remarkably happy, as they were all on deck, in view of every ſcene of delight; and were in regular pairs, to match in the participation of inſtructive or recreative converſation.</p>
                  <p>The planet of day was now got to his greateſt altitude; and ere the time-piece pointed it was five minutes paſt noon, there aroſe a murmuring in the breezes that had juſt then ſprung up.—The trees with a ſilky conſiſtence made a ſudden ruſtling, as though their boughs were cruſhed by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible power;—the waters curled, verg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in oblong ſheets, and ſeemed to bear marked ſinking points, as though engraved with a pungent machine.</p>
                  <p>The rarified atmoſphere, which in the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs boundary of ſight ſhowed a lively blue, by a raiſed denſity of particles which aroſe with the ſouth weſt wind, (an awful layer of woolpack forms,) filled with the moon's attractive chriſtalized element, oppoſed themſelves with the pale or red repoſitories of Sol's meteors;—the caverns of the earth at the ſame juncture yielded up the confined
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:022876_0182_0FBA9B4591C5C248"/>
fluid of the roving winds;—thus the face or heaven brought quickly in view the threats of contention between the four elements:— and as man is a compoſition of theſe four, it behoves him at all times upon ſuch appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances to provide for his ſafety.</p>
                  <p>The land party perceived the approaching ſtorm, and were fearful of its effects,—and by ſigns, made known their wiſhes, for the barge to gain the ſhore,—but to perform this deſirable work, the waterman found im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable;—as no creek of ſafety was now nearer than two leagues, and to gain it great hazard would accrue:—for the part of the country which they now were coaſting, was all along a high ridge for nearly the laſt ſix miles,—and was of the ſame appearance for the like number of miles, which they were obliged to purſue to obtain any place of ſafety in the threatening ſtorm.—It was a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma of equal concluſion;—to return or to purſue were difficulties of like delay,—the wind being on their larboard bow one way, and on their ſtarboard the other:—ſo a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of their voyage to the creek was determined; there to land and remain du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the night, if the weather continued boiſterous, was the reſolve of the gentlemen on board.</p>
                  <p>The ladies were terrified by the timidity of the watermen, who were ten in number, but who were to a man fearful of the agitated element, well knowing the danger of the rocky ſhore.
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:022876_0183_0FBA9B48C473BD70"/>
—But as cowardice adds to danger, the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen made light of the fears of the pilot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing watermen,—by which the ladies were ſomewhat calmed.</p>
                  <p>It was ſtrikingly awful in the aſpect of the perſons whoſe conſciences threatened them in the hour of danger;—and of thoſe whoſe monitor held out a tranſcript of the eaſe and comforts of the heart, and whoſe works knew no pollution.—His Grace of Kingſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough and his Dutcheſs ſat with compoſure, —ſerene innocence in the latter, and reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in the former, both joining in a dox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology to heaven for all former bleſſings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confident of heaven's future care, as their lives were without reprehenſion, except in the ſtate of nature;—in this they were well verſed, and knew the neceſſity of being partakers of the living ſacrifice, at whoſe table they were conſtant attendants,—the preceding Sabbath being their laſt.</p>
                  <p>Others of this polite company were not to, —Lord Dacie and his conſort felt themſelves differently,—for the terrors of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences repreſented death in a more hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible view, than the fabled appearance of Tiſiphone, the worſt of the three furies of hell. Their hearts failed them, they almoſt faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through the extreme of fear.</p>
                  <p>The Earl of Bellview and his charming Counteſs were like the noble Duke and Dutcheſs, juſt now mentioned;—they were not at all diſmayed, cheerfulneſs appeared in
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:022876_0184_0FBA9B4A57882F68"/>
each of them.—Lady Ann Colville was the ſame. The captain was in tolerable good ſpirits, as were General Mounſey and his lady. —Lord and Lady Fairford were greatly terrified;—the former from conviction, the latter from a timidity of opinion, that it was inevitable death, if the ſtorm ſhould overtake them;—not conſidering the hand of Providence, that could raiſe and lay the power of the winds, or of any other of the elements.</p>
                  <p>Here we ſee the uncertainty of human enjoyments!—all were happy an hour before,—and now the lowering face of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven affrighted the greateſt part into the moſt abject opinion of the power of the omipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent being.—But the bruiſed conſciences of ſinners will, ſooner or later, convict them of the unregenerate ſtate they are in, if a ſight of danger preſents itſelf.</p>
                  <p>The land party were not much better off! —Every one of them felt exceedingly for the danger their children or relations were expoſed to.—The ſtorm made a beginning, by repeated peals of awful thunder!—no houſe was near for ſhelter, except a barn, which was now opened for the reception of early harveſt.—No perſon was therein, ſo that the foremoſt of the travellers were houſed on the falling of the firſt drops of the thunder ſhower.—Sir William Howard and 'Squire Lee were in the rear a quarter of a mile;—the ſhower commenced ſo heavy,
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:022876_0185_0FBA9B4B9ECE8538"/>
that a large ſpreading oak, which was but a few paces from the highway, ſeemed a ſhelter from the impending ſtorm.</p>
                  <p>By this time the ſmooth element which the morning had preſented with ſuch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching temptation, was now become a turbulent, boiſterous, and furious ſea; frothing and foaming, driving its agitated mountains, in mighty torrents againſt the oppoſing rocks!—Now the happineſs the morning boaſted of, was ſunk as far below the mediocrity of hope, as it had riſen before on the approach of pleaſure!—This is the barometer of man's fluctuating ſtate!—His glaſs riſes high, low, and perhaps runs out within the hour!—So, whoever places his happineſs in the ſuperficial appearance of things, may be aſſured he will be deceived; —and if not provided againſt the worſt, to his utter and irreparable loſs.</p>
                  <p>The barge, although a good ſea boat, was by this time toſſed at the pleaſure of the furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous winds.—All the rigging and ornamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal decorations were torn, as if compoſed of paper;—and drifted into the overflowing tide.—Nothing was left to obſtruct the blaſt but a bare maſt,—the boom having been torn from it and forced overboard;—the ſea rolling ſo dreadfully, that it was imagined, every minute by all on board, that ſhe muſt overſet,—therefore the company were ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all between decks,—every man in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of his wife;—whilſt the very colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:022876_0186_0FBA9B4F12A043C8"/>
of horror was to be ſeen in ſeveral faces! —but an earneſt cry to him, in whoſe hands the earth, ſea, and winds are, was unremit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly poured forth.</p>
                  <p>The thunder's ſounding hoarſeneſs ſeemed to increaſe, and lightning flaſhed through every crevice.—The maſt was ſhivered into a thouſand pieces, although no perſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived any material hurt!—This dreadful craſh might well be ſuppoſed to rouſe the very inmoſt thoughts of thoſe who were ſo nigh the danger.—Scarce had their panic ſubſided, and they were again ſeated, when a deluge of water ſtove in the quarter deck, by which they were all completely wet;— and the Duke and Lord Belview were ſlightly wounded by ſome ſplinters that flew from the forced joiſts.</p>
                  <p>Death now ſeemed to all inevitable, ſo each reſigned himſelf to God in prayer!— but Lord Dacie eſſayed to go up to the rails, which formed the netting on the quarter deck, —in this he was oppoſed by the two wounded Noblemen, who remonſtrated with him on the impropriety of ſuch conduct;—but he replied, death was as certain between decks as above, and as he could ſwim well, perhaps he might ſave his life.—In this whim, or rather preſuming notion, he was joined by Lord Fairford, who ſaid he had the like abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.—Lord Belview advanced every thing he could againſt ſuch a ſtep,—adding, it was a piece of cruelty to leave the Ladies in
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:022876_0187_0FBA9B5116CF3FA8"/>
this minute of trying danger and extremity; —and that it was an offence to the Deity to act upon ſuch principles; for a man ſhould at all times hazard as much on his wife's account as his own:—and that in men of exalted parts and exemplary lives, it had been known, that they could have ſaved their own lives, if they had choſen to relinquiſh their wives; but no inſtance ever occurred wherein any ſuch men abandoned their wives in the hour of danger,—as it betrayed every thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the dignity of human nature.</p>
                  <p>His Lordſhip's words had no effect.—The Duke then conjured them to ſtay and ſhare their fate, obſerving, that God's power was not abated;—and that there were ſtill hopes if they could put faith in that Beneficent Being, who never deceived any who really and ſincerely relied on his mercy;—and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obſerved, that notwithſtanding the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the tempeſt, and the impetuoſity of the waves, he had a full aſſurance in his mind, and reſted confident, thro' his hope in God, that they ſhould all get ſafe to ſhore. —He therefore entreated thoſe Lords not to abandon their wives, nor betray their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the goodneſs of the Supreme Being.</p>
                  <p>All that either the Duke or Lord Bellview could advance, had not any effect on thoſe congenial characters, who were in their feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings equally agitated.—The perturbed ſtate of their minds raiſed them nearly to lunacy, —for to receive death calmly, they ſuppoſed
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:022876_0188_0FBA9B525263BBB0"/>
to be a dangerous plan, as the word chance was of efficacy with them; therefore they went on deck and laid faſt hold of the rail that ſupported the net work, of the fair wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeats.—In this poſture they continued for nearly twenty minutes, notwithſtanding they were within hearing of the lamentable cries of Lady Dacie and Lady Fairford; who would have been toſſed againſt the benches, as the barge rolled, were it not that the Duke of Kingſborough and Lord Bellview, took each one of them under the oppoſite arm to that in which their Ladies were placed.</p>
                  <p>As the ſea rolled with ſuch heavy ſhocks, it was impoſſible for any of the gentlemen to quit their ſituations to entreat the abſent Lords who were almoſt, ſpectators of the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the deep!—However, General Mounſey repeatedly called aloud to them to return;—but it was in vain,—they were deaf to all entreaties.—The horrors of death were of too dreadful an aſpect for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them to open their ears to any other care than that of ſelf-preſervation.—(A moſt ſtriking repreſentation of a conſcious guilt of preying upon the ſpirits, even in the very hour of death.)—The ſea beat over their heads like mountains of earth, depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; them of day light.</p>
                  <p>At about twenty minutes paſt three o'clock in the afternoon, the railing was heard to give way; and ſo in a great ſwell, in which
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:022876_0189_0FBA9B53D3FB5F28"/>
the barge ſhipped a heavy ſea, were carried away the netting, rails, and of conſequence the two unfortunate obſtinate Lords!— Thus they periſhed through a perverſe diſpoſition!—When they meant to ſave their lives, they loſt them!—For their truſt was not in God, but in their own cunning!— A deadly and a deceitful enemy to the true happineſs of human nature.</p>
                  <p>The watermen, or as we ſhould call them, ſeamen, as they had to encounter that boiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous element, were of opinion that the barge was off the creek; as ſhe was hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to at liberty to drift along the ſhore at the pleaſure of the wind and tide. The Duke ordered them to ſtand to the helm, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to put her before the current, which beat up the creek.—But ſtill the ſea kept her vehement toſſing, and the winds their howling!—the rain and lightning rolled like incorporated ſheets upon the ſhattered deck! yet, by the direction of that power, whoſe unerring ſkill ſurmounts all difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which to man oft times ſeems an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility, the barge or ſea boat got to the entrance of the creek, and with a flowing tide took the further end at one tack, and ſtuck faſt in the mud, which ſecured her from the ebbing of the ſurge.—Thus the votaries to pleaſure gained the land!—which they all with uplifted hands and hearts thanked the Supreme Power for the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="187" facs="unknown:022876_0190_0FBA9B555110F138"/>The unfortunate ſons of obſtinancy were now to be regretted,—but it was in vain to repine at the decrees of heaven;—they were no more!</p>
                  <p>The gay embarquants now in ſadneſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked; yet thankful to heaven for their eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape from the ſurrounding terrors of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary threatening death.</p>
                  <p>In their wretched plight, the humane inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the little town gave all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort their humble life afforded.—Beds were got ready, and each couple thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves happy to find a roof over their heads, and a firm ground beneath their feet.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, the land party were not much better off,—for corroding care, and reſtleſs ſuſpenſe, heightened the anxiety and almoſt deſpairing condition of thoſe who occupied the barn.—The barge was loſt ſight of by them!—the dark clouds of riſing bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows towered above the ſides of the little veſſel, which at repeated times would have been enveloped in the ſurging waves, had it not been for the all preſerving power of the inviſible hand that was ſtretched out to help and ſave thoſe for whom further work on earth was deſigned.—The barn loſt its roof in the whirlwind of a tremendous and awful clap of thunder!—and the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in a vivid flame ſet the ſedgy covering on fire.</p>
                  <p>The houſed ſanctuary was now become a place of imminent danger!—All of its temporary

inhabitants fled with the utmoſt precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſheltered themſelves beneath the roof of an humble cottage, which preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed itſelf at ſome diſtance, where they found undiſſembled hoſpitality;—the cottager and his family removing themſelves from the convenient ſeats of their unadorned dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, found thereby a means to ſeat their hapleſs gueſts, who were now beyond the limits of patience in their anxious cares.</p>
                  <p>During the former part of the ſtorm, we have obſerved the goodly Knight with 'Squire Lee, had taken their ſhelter under the ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing branches of a venerable oak;—in which ſituation they continued for a conſiderable time, which, according to the relation of Mr. Lee, might have been an hour or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts.—During this time the venerable ſage ſeemed enwrapped in the ſcenes of the aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful majeſty of heaven; obſerving to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, the happineſs of being at peace with that power, whoſe works were now in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance!—that when the pleaſure of the author of our being was made known to the meſſengers of his preſence, to require our attendance, we were like the wiſe virgins in the parable, ready with our lamps, burning the incenſe of a clear conſcience.</p>
                  <p>The worthy man then with uplifted eyes to heaven, in a doxology of ſome length, expreſſed his acknowledgments due to the bounty of his God!—then earneſtly invok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a bleſſing on his children, to preſerve

them from the dangers of the ſeas, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry caſual viciſſitude; and that they might continually have before their faces, a view of the requiſites to perform the commands, and conform to the will of the Moſt High; —granting them an emancipation from the works and words of their ſpiritual enemy, whoſe power was in the vanity of depraved mortals greatly advanced.—He further add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with devotional fervency, the hope he had in the tribunal and eternal power of the Almighty,—and in the good time of the wiſdom of the deity to give him a releaſe from the precarious ſituation of human life, which was a round of chequered ſcenes, in which the proneneſs of evil had gained ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior numbers;—concluding with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of his friends and enemies to the throne of grace, and a reſignation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the will of the Supreme Being.</p>
                  <p>Theſe laſt words were juſt gone forth, the breath being ſcarcely departed from his lips, when a deafening clang and dreadful rumble of etherial fire, broke through the fable cloud that over hung the oak, and in the ſpace of a lightning flaſh, the ball of liquid fire deſcended on the trunk of the ſturdy overgrown druid favourite;—dividing it from the topmoſt ſhoot to the roots!—and in that inſtant left the ſpeaking monitor of truth and honor, lifeleſs, at the verge of the graſſy circumſcription of the ſapient ſuckers under the blaſted tree!</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="190" facs="unknown:022876_0193_0FBA9B5CDFF51F30"/>Mr. Lee, who was attentive to the words of the departed ſon of wiſdom, was beyond meaſure aſtoniſhed,—affrighted,—and ſtruck with terror, agony, and ſurpriſe!—and tho' he ſtood within a hand's breath of the fallen great good man, he received no hurt what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; only the electrical ſenſation of being ſtunned by the proximity of the volatile flame which had lodged itſelf in the earth.</p>
                  <p>Some minutes paſſed before he collected his reaſon!—then on his knees, with fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent zeal, he thanked, and aſked a bleſſing of further preſervation from heaven;—and with eyes rivetted to the ſpot whereon Sir William lay, he gazed, wonder ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in his ſight.—For upwards of two hours continuance he ſtood by his deceaſed friend;—the ſtorm then abating, he purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the loanſome road, to overtake his fellow travellers,—and on his arrival at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed barn, ſaw the footſteps of both ſexes, in the moiſtened mould. He lifted up his eyes, and perceived the cot wherein the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the barn had found a further ſhelter! —he haſted thither, where he found his companions and their ladies well wet, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted, and fatigued.—But all their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles ſlept in forgetfulneſs, on hearing of the fate of the honorable Baronet!—All were in tears,—terror,—and ſurpriſe!—They then, with redoubled pangs of anxious care, doubted of the exiſtence of the ſea toiled

party.—Horror and amaſement ſat ghaſtly on every brow! —</p>
                  <p>Let blanks ſupply the place of words,— all that the cottager's gueſts conceived, felt, and ſuffered on Mr. Lee's relation.</p>
                  <p>The town of Barpoint, which was adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent to the coving creek in which the barge arrived, was about ſix miles diſtant.—The cottager related the ſafety of the ſea compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, if they had arrived there;—to know the truth of conjecture, the company remount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their open carriages, and with the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the peaſant, haſted thither.</p>
                  <p>About ſeven o'clock in the evening they arrived,—but were told the company of the barge had ſeparate lodgings, and were gone to reſt, through the fatigue they ſuffered at ſea;—their garments being quite wet thro' with the rolling waves that the veſſel had ſhipped in the ſtorm. By advice of each other, the late arrived company propoſed to keep ſilent the matter of Sir William How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard's premature death until the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;—judging it would, without any good accruing, or ſervice obtained, prevent the Duke and Dutcheſs, his ſon and daughter from reſt;—and with equal ſupriſe mar the comforts of the others of the harraſſed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
                  <p>A worthy clergyman, who was the only
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:022876_0195_0FBA9B601088ECE8"/>
man of elevated rank or eaſy circumſtances in the village, (for the name of a town, Barpoint could ſcarcely claim) having juſt heard of ſeveral perſons being in diſtreſs, —with all the humanity his ſacerdotal habit ſhould poſſeſs, entreated the weatherbound viſitants to accept of his humble roof, where he would, in the beſt manner he was able, accommodate them;—and expreſſed his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret at being abſent from his houſe on the arrival of the barge,—elſe he ſhould have lodged her company, who were obliged to accept the offers of his peaſant pariſhioners.</p>
                  <p>The grateful company thanked the good clergyman for his urbanity and hoſpitality, and without heſitation accepted his kind of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer; where they remained, well provided with wholeſome proviſions and chriſtian care until the next morning.</p>
                  <p>The attendants, with more aſſiſtants, took care of the body of the deceaſed worthy Baronet, and in a ſhell conveyed it into the Church, where his remains were depoſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for that night.</p>
                  <p>The bargemen were equally ſucceſsful in picking up the bodies of Lord Dacie and Lord Fairford, which the ſurfy ſhore had gained, at ſome diſtance from the creek of Barpoint;—their bodies alſo were lain in ſhells, and depoſited in the church where Sir William Howard was laid.</p>
                  <p>Next morning uſhered in a glorious fine day of ſettled weather,—and the attentive
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:022876_0196_0FBA9B6354F9D7B0"/>
parſon who had lodged the land travellers, called on all the ſea voyagers at their reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pective lodgings, to come to his dwelling, informing them of their friends being there. —They all obeyed the ſummons very thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, when the humane rector acquainted the ſea and land travellers with their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent misfortunes.—For as yet the accidents of the one party were not known to the other.</p>
                  <p>The conjunction of parties would have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded a real pleaſure,—had it not been for the preceding accidents.—For on a perfect underſtanding of their misfortunes, all were blended in the lamentable ſcene of woe;— the day of nominal pleaſure brought forth a day of irretrievable loſs, grief and anguiſh.</p>
                  <p>The noble Duke of Kingſborough and his amiable conſort were inconſolable in the loſs of their honorable father, who was a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of reſpectability, worthy of example. —The Duke of Aſhbridge, his Dutcheſs, Sir James Dampier, and his Lady <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly ſorrowful for the untimely death of their ſon.—The good 'Squire Lee, and his relation, the Marquis and his family, were all extremely grieved for the unhappy fate of Lord Fairford.—Proper ſteps were taken to pay a due compliment to the deceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;—the whole company returned to the ſeat of the late Sir William Howard, now the manſion of the Duke his ſon;—hearſes were provided, and the bodies removed, —when after a period of lying in ſtate, due
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:022876_0197_0FBA9B65D2907100"/>
to their rank, they were ſeverally depoſited in the vaults of the Howard and Kingſbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough families, at Highmeadow, where each raiſed a record in marble to the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable merit of their deceaſed near relations.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of Kingſborough cauſed to be erected under his own direction, a ſuperb monument, with emblematical repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, trite inſcriptions, and faithful records and delineations of his father's never dying fame!—For in the good and great Sir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Howard, pure philanthropy, with mild benevolence and Chriſtian charity, found their abode;—and have made a name in Howard, which will ever grace human nature;—and at this period gives a name to a congenial mind, whoſe words and works can only be equalled by the deceaſed Sir William Howard—the patron of the poor, and the huſband and parent to the widow and fatherleſs!—Penſe à bien, J'ai bonne cauſe.</p>
                  <p>After the interment, each family returned to their reſpective ſeats:—the Duke and Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs of Kingſborough remained at Howard's-Caſtle.—They ſolaced each other with peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful leſſons of piety, harmony, love, and tenderneſs, and which were their conſtant attendants.—Diſcord, irreligion, and pride, were as in the life time of the deceaſed wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy proprietor, denied any kind of employ or admiſſion.—The worthy parſon of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:022876_0198_0FBA9B6694C0FD00"/>
was called to the living of Highmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, on the preſentation of his Grace, the rector having departed this life to enjoy a better, which it is to be hoped he ſucceeded to, as he was truly a Chriſtian</p>
                  <p>This change to the Barpoint parſon, was happy indeed;—for it gave him a means to provide comfortably for a wife and ſix chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which he had done tolerably well at an income only of forty pounds a year;—but his Grace's unſolicited kindneſs, raiſed him, with the chaplaincy to the Duke, to a living of eight hundred pounds per annum.</p>
                  <p>Ten months after marriage, the charming Dutcheſs of Kingſborough brought forth a pledge of her love, which gave to her and her Lord the happy name of parents.—The child was a male, and was baptiſed William, in memory of his grandfather.</p>
                  <p>The Counteſs of Bellview did the like honor to her Lord, in about the ſame time; a daughter was the fruit of their love.</p>
                  <p>The other characters which are drawn we don't recollect had ſuch early pledges of their affections.—But we remember, that about this time, Lady Dacie changed her name for that of Lee, which was a happy marriage;—for 'Squire Lee, the brother of Lady Fairford, was the perſon who became her huſband. His ſettled principles and ſedate deportment, made a reformation in the diſpoſition of that Lady;—for Lady Dacie is now a prudent, virtuous perſon, and does the graces of her rank with a due
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:022876_0199_0FBA9C7FDD7A4F78"/>
ſenſe of honor—Her ſon which was born as heir to Lord Dacie, in the expectant rank of the Dukedom of Aſhbridge, is a fine promiſing child;—and his grandfather the Duke, has applied to the upper houſe, and ſettled in him the right of ſucceſſion.</p>
                  <p>Lady Dampier's pride is ſomewhat hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled;—ſhe now begins to think ſhe cannot live for ever;—and although ſhe has worn grey hairs theſe ten years, ſhe has retained the vanity of dreſs, faſhion, and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion until within theſe laſt ſix months.—It is to be hoped, in ſix months more, ſhe will have forgotten that paint, pride, and oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, in advanced life, is incompatible with religion, mortification, and repentance.</p>
                  <p>The moraliſt may deem the victims of an untimely death, a ſingular inſtance of the viſitation of heaven, and rather a forced method to raiſe a tragic ſcene;—but here it will be proper to obſerve to ſuch a claſs of readers,—"<hi>That God is not the author of evil."—"That the wicked man ſhall not live half his days."—"That God delights not in the death of a ſinner, but rather that he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and live.</hi>"—and "<hi>That time and chance happeneth to all men.</hi>"</p>

                  <p>Thus life is ſhortened by the wicked man! —And that agreeable to the preacher of wiſdom, "<hi>time and chance happeneth to all men.</hi>"—Certainly they do, for time is the meaſure of his probationary ſtay in a ſublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſtate.—Chance is a ſynonymy of the manner of his exit, whether naturally or violently;—ſo that on the whole review of human hature, it muſt be allowed, "<hi>that vice like envy, carries the ſting of its own pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment;—whilſt virtue like innocence, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

                  <head>THE FAIR SOLITARY, OR, FEMALE HERMIT. A NOVEL.</head>
                  <p>AT a viſit Alicia, and ſome ladies of her acquaintance, paid Belinda at her country ſeat, a motion was made to put the horſes to the coach and take an airing. The ſeaſon of the year admitted of getting out early, and their journey was to a meadow by a river ſide, with a large wood at the end. On one ſide of this wood was a pretty ſteep rock, on the top of which ſtood an hermitage, and at the foot of the rock ran a pretty broad ſtream, which ſeemed to forbid a farther paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage. This water riſes from a torrent, which falls from the hill on the rocks. The mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring noiſe it makes, together with the natural caſcades it forms, in the gloom of the wood, preſents the eye with as agreeable an entertainment as the moſt cultivated ſpot of ground can do.</p>
                  <p>"This is my uſual walk, ſays Belinda, I like the ſilence of the place. It inſpires a ſoothing melancholy. Hither I often repair
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:022876_0206_0FBA9C910394E2A8"/>
alone, or without any company but my thoughts."</p>
                  <p>"But do you never meet with the Hermit, and have you not yet ventured into his habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation," ſaid one of the ladies? "I have not had a ſight of him yet, anſwered ſhe."</p>
                  <p>Well, ſaid Alicia, I love theſe hermits, and ſhould be glad of a little talk with one of them. A way of life ſo much out of the common courſe makes me fancy, that they muſt needs be either vaſtly ſuperior to, or very much below other men.</p>
                  <p>Here the company alighted, and walked over a green, cloſe by the ſide of a brook. On going further they came to a place, where the tall poplars which grew on the banks of the river hung very much over, and by their bending formed a kind of a bridge, at the foot of which appeared a ſmall path in the rock, by which the aſcent was eaſy to the top; but whether made by nature, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived by art, is uncertain.</p>
                  <p>The ladies, guided by their curioſity, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed this ſmall track, and ſoon got to the door of the hermitage. They ſaw at the ſame time a tall handſome woman haſtily enter this rural habitation, and pull the wicket after her; upon which, ſaid they, ſince women are admitted here, we may alſo claim the ſame right. Accordingly they knocked at the door, but nobody would anſwer. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing however to make a loud noiſe, and giving thereby to underſtand that they would
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:022876_0207_0FBA9C91E1DB82D0"/>
not be denied, the ſame perſon they had ſeen before, came out, and told them, her little dwelling was not worthy the notice of ladies of their faſhion. They made anſwer, that their buſineſs was with the Hermit who lived there, and that they muſt ſee him; upon which the woman, perceiving it would be in vain to make any further reſiſtance, opened the door, but at the ſame time told them that they would find nobody there but herſelf. The company ſtepped in haſtily, and having ſoon looked over the little cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, which was plain and homely, but neat, were indeed much ſurpriſed to find no other perſon but the woman.</p>
                  <p>"Our curioſity increaſes, ſays Belinda: How can you live here by yourſelf? What an odd ſort of life is this for a woman, and what could make you embrace it? The more I view you, the more my aſtoniſhment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes. By your age and appearance you ſeem unfit for ſo wild a dwelling, you might be an ornament to cities."—And indeed through a dejected air, and a ſweet modeſt countenance, ſhe diſcovered much beauty. "Alas! replied the Solitary, I am unable to anſwer ſuch compliments. I am almoſt a ſtranger to the uſual language of the world, neither have I, during four years abode in this retreat, ſeen or converſed with any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man creature."—Who then ſupplies you with the neceſſaries of life? aſked they.— "A young woman, returned ſhe, who had
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:022876_0208_0FBA9C935156C438"/>
an affection for me, would fain have accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied me hither, but, having a family, ſhe could not leave it. However ſhe is ſettled in a neighbouring town, whence ſhe brings me twice a week more than is ſufficient for the ſupport of a life, which I wiſh I had, and which I ought to have loſt long ago."</p>
                  <p>Theſe words were followed by a flood of tears, which, together with her appearance and diſtreſs, ſoon gained her the compaſſion of her fair gueſts, "In ſeeing you, cried they, it is impoſſible to avoid pitying you, whilſt the intereſt we take in your misfortunes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titles us to their recital. Let their cauſe be what it will, we ſhall ſtill pity you. If you are wretched through the fault of others, we will join in your reſentment; if by your own, fortune only ſhall be to blame, and you ſhall never appear guilty in our eyes."</p>
                  <p>"Your indulgence and good-nature, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, replied ſhe, will not reconcile me to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. I have quitted the world to ſhun my own being, but am ſtill always preſent to myſelf. I thought that, when I ſhould no longer have witneſſes to my follies, I might then poſſibly forgive and forget them. But, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileſs to myſelf, I am ever condemning and puniſhing them. The ſilence of theſe woods brings them freſher to my mind, and adds new feeling to their ſting. Diſengaged from all things elſe, they alone are the employment of my whole leiſure time.—"Perhaps, fair lady," reſumed Alicia, "it is an over delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:022876_0209_0FBA9C94D8E02DE8"/>
only that makes you thus cruel to yourſelf. However, you cannot well refuſe the recital of your misfortunes to people that already take ſo large a ſhare in them."</p>
                  <p>She would have excuſed herſelf, but the ladies, whoſe curioſity was greatly raiſed, aſſuring her they would not leave her till ſhe had acquainted them with her unfortunate hiſtory. She began thus.</p>
                  <p>"Since then, ladies, you inſiſt upon it, I ſhall give you a plain narrative of my life, in which, though I may not have the merit of appearing innocent in your eyes, I ſhall at leaſt have that of being ſincere.—I am born of a noble family. My father had the happineſs of having ſerved his king and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try well in many important occaſions, and enjoyed great places at court; but, meeting afterwards with ſome injuſtice in having a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val preferred to a poſt he thought his due, he grew highly diſguſted. At that very time he had done the king of S—a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able piece of ſervice, ſo that, thinking all his obligations to his country, and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful prince, cancelled by the unjuſt treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he had met with, he engaged in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion that was raiſed againſt him. As he had the chief command in a great province, it was an eaſy matter for him to bring about a change of maſters amongſt the people of his government; he was very indifferent about making terms for himſelf. The ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices he was doing the cauſe, and a large
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:022876_0210_0FBA9C99C54FFC40"/>
province he was ſubduing, were his hoſtages and ſecurities for the promiſes they made him, whilſt on our part we had nothing but bare words to depend upon. In the mean while all our eſtates and preferments were forfeited; in lieu of which we had only fine promiſes, which were but indifferently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. I was then very young, had loſt my mother, and was the delight of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I had an only brother, ſome years older than myſelf, who went to the army with my father, and learned the art of war under his direction.</p>
                  <p>As for myſelf, I was to be ſent to one of thoſe houſes that are deſtined for the educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of young ladies, but the princeſs Zaide, whoſe huſband had formerly commanded in our province, being very intimate with my father, begged of him to leave me with her, which he conſented to. This lady was fond of children, they were her chief diverſion, and ſhe had but one ſon. I was brought up with as much care as if I had been her own daughter: ſhe appointed me governeſſes and proper maſters, who cultivated all my good inclinations. She took a kind of pleaſure and amuſement in dreſſing me, and often gave little entertainments to the young children of my age. I had the good luck to pleaſe in them, and always ſtrove to out-do even what was thought well in the reſt.</p>
                  <p>The prince Camillus (that was her ſon's name) was ſome years older than I. He
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:022876_0211_0FBA9C9B92A73CF0"/>
had a noble and graceful perſon. We lived together, and whenever he had done with his maſters, he would ſeek my company with great fondneſs. In all his actions he gave me a remarkable preference over my companions. As I advanced in age, the graces, I am told, were not wholly unmindful of my perſon, and his liking to me increaſed every day. I too early experienced the pleaſure of being loved, and found a ſatisfaction in it. It is an unhappy thing to contract ſuch an habit from our infancy.</p>
                  <p>Prince Camillus's friends had deſigned him for the duke of * * *'s daughter. Her name was Valeria: ſhe was the heireſs of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, ſo that an ample fortune and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed titles made her a match worthy of him. He was often conducted to pay his court to her; ſhe likewiſe came to wait on the old princeſs, and we often met together at our little plays and entertainments. She was handſome, and could not bear the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable preference our young lover gave me: in revenge ſhe would often reflect with ſcorn and contempt on my fortune; but the prince's commendations and my glaſs made me perfectly eaſy; for I was already of an age to find a ſatisfaction in being handſome.</p>
                  <p>His reluctance to viſit the lady Valeria ſoon grew remarkable. Hitherto we had lived together without any manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint and his attachment to me had been looked upon as of no conſequence; but as
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:022876_0212_0FBA9C9D0FF991B0"/>
it increaſed every day, it began to grow ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and he was therefore forbid to enter my apartment.</p>
                  <p>His love quickened by this prohibition. He grew ſad and melancholy; and as he was of a hot and fiery temper, the reſtraint that was laid upon his inclinations acted upon his health in ſuch a manner, that he fell ſick. His mother was greatly alarmed at the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. Valeria too came ſeveral times to viſit him, but he paid her regard with ſo much coldneſs, that ſhe was prodigiouſly nettled at the return. In the mean while his illneſs gained ſo much upon him, that other conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations were laid aſide to apply to the ſaving of his life. He was therefore allowed to ſee me, and I was accordingly conducted to his apartment by the women who had the care of me. The ſight of me had a ſpeedier effect upon him than all the art of the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, and his health returned in proportion to the liberty he had of being in my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. His mother, however, was revenged on me for the neceſſity ſhe was reduced to of allowing an intercourſe, the conſequences of which were ſo much dreaded. She no longer retained the ſame tender friendſhip for me; the commendations that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on me, and with which ſhe was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſo well pleaſed, now grew offenſive to her, and I was often puniſhed for being liked too much.</p>
                  <p>The prince, having at laſt perfectly reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:022876_0213_0FBA9C9EF2884F50"/>
his health, became in a ſhort time the moſt accompliſhed lord in the court. He began now to aſſume an air of haughtineſs and independance, and ſlight the aſſiſtance of his maſters, but retained ſtill an infinite reſpect for his mother; though I was the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of his obedience. He obeyed her in every thing except in what related to me.</p>
                  <p>At length ſhe expoſtulated the matter one day with him, and aſked what he meant at laſt to do by his attachment for me? "Every thing, madam, anſwered he; for when I meet with birth, virtue and beauty in the object of my affections, I think I may, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bluſhing, own my paſſion and further intentions." So ſmart and reſolute an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer made her tremble; ſhe repreſented to him the great diſtance there was between him and me, the mis<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="4 letters">
                        <desc>••••</desc>
                     </gap>unes of my family, the loſs of our preferment and the forfeiture of our eſtates; to all which he replied, "There fortune only is to blame, not ſhe; and may you not too, madam, be a little in fault, to ſet ſo high a value on that ſort of advantages which do not depend on us?"— But, anſwered the princeſs, "you find in Valeria both thoſe you are taken with, and the others you reproach me with making too great an account of." Oh, madam! re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the young prince, my heart and your eyes are widely different in their judgments. You ſee, but I feel; and whatever inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:022876_0214_0FBA9CA091759AC0"/>
there is between perſons, love brings them all to a level."</p>
                  <p>The princeſs now ſaw that there was no time to be loſt, but that I muſt be ſent out of the way, and accordingly I was put into a houſe deſigned for a retreat from the world. The prince was no ſooner appriſed of the news, but he flew to the place, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened the perſons appointed for my keepers to have recourſe to the laſt extremities, if they did not produce me. His menaces were of no effect; they perſiſted in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal, and proteſted they would let no body ſee me without an order from the princeſs, his mother. He went to her next, and ſpoke with a tranſport of heat, which offended her. He ſaid, that he was not obliged to her for a life ſhe was endeavouring to make ſo wretched; that the happineſs of his days would be to unit<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s fortune with mine, and that her power did not extend to an empire over the mind; and, upon her attempting to ſet before him her authority and his duty, he told her ſmartly, that the heart had rights and dues of its own apart from all others.</p>
                  <p>The princeſs was prudent; ſhe ſaw it would be in vain to ſtruggle againſt the ſtream, and therefore told him that ſhe would ſacrifice her juſt reſentment to her regard for him; that ſhe looked upon him as a perſon out of order, who claimed her pity; but that he could not refuſe her to be ſix months with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeeing me, ſince ſuch a compliance would
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:022876_0215_0FBA9CA2FB4F45F8"/>
coſt him the leſs, as the campaign was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, and he muſt ſet out to take upon him the command of the troops the king had thought fit to truſt him with; and that ſhe was perſuaded the paſſion that poſſeſſed him, had not quite extinguiſhed the love of glory in his ſoul.—This, indeed, was true; never man enjoyed thoſe two ſentiments in a higher degree; neither did the one in the leaſt take from the other.</p>
                  <p>He could not well deny the princeſs, but aſſured her withal that his paſſion was not to be leſſened by time, and that reflection, which never fails curing ordinary flames, would but increaſe his.</p>
                  <p>Whatever he could ſay to the contrary, ſhe was ſtill in hopes that time and abſence would do much for her, and therefore now bent her thoughts on endeavouring to divert one idea by another. She procured him a moſt mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent equipage, and provided for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the moſt pompous attendants that could be found, and joined to theſe ſeveral old officers who had behaved beſt in the king's ſervice, to train him up to greatneſs. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was forgotten that might inſpire him with the love of glory, and, as he had a vaſt ſhare of honor, he did not heſitate to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace a courſe ſo much becoming his birth. He prepared therefore to ſet out for the army, where his ſenſe of glory was equalled by the ſhining opportunities he had to purſue it.</p>
                  <p>A young man of merit who belonged to
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:022876_0216_0FBA9CA3F67FDFB0"/>
his retinue ſoon became his confidante. He was born of a good family, and could take the liberty of often diſcourſing him about his preſent ſituation, and pitying his being abandoned to a paſſion, which, as it diſtracted his mother, ſo it might likewiſe caſt a ſtain upon his own reputation. Love, he told him, was not juſtifiable in great men till they had paid the tribute due to glory, and that it might indeed be a ſtate of paſſage in the life of an hero, but that glory was a qualification that claimed a laſting place therein. "Deſcended from the blood you ſpring from, continued he, and with the merit you poſſeſs, you have vaſt expectations of courage and magnanimity to anſwer."</p>
                  <p>This was in vain, he was not to be heard yet. The prince was abandoned to a deſpair, from which every thing might be feared. He had often repaired to the place of my confinement, and, not having been able to obtain a ſight of me, had with difficulty been with-held from the laſt violences. His confidante Timander, who ſoothed his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh by his gentleneſs, and the complaiſant diſcharge of the truſt he placed in him, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed him at laſt to bring me a letter from him. Accordingly he waited on the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and repreſented to her, that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to compound a little with the prince's grief; that were ſhe to inſiſt upon a ſtrict compliance with her orders, and exact obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience with too much rigour, ſhe might
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:022876_0217_0FBA9CA5D47B39A0"/>
drive him to the greateſt extremities; that ſhe ought not to put her power in competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the force of love, nor ſet up her rights againſt thoſe of the heart, for neither were to be controuled by authority; that the prince ought to be pitied and diverted by ſome great object, without being made ſenſible of their deſign; and that in exalted and haughty ſouls there were great reſources to be found to work them to our ends. He concluded by accquainting her, that the prince had deſired him to bring me a letter, that he was accordingly come to receive her orders, and that as to himſelf, ſhe might reſt aſſured ſhe had nothing to fear from the confidence her ſon placed in him.</p>
                  <p>The princeſs having yielded to theſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Timander came and found me me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy and thoughtful. Your beauty, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, ſaid he, makes ſtrange work already. Is this the firſt trial of your ſkill? I gave him no anſwer, but what he could read in my confuſed countenance and baſhful looks: however, continued he, here is a letter the prince has ordered me to deliver into your hands.—I muſt not take it, ſaid I, and am extremely ſorry for the effect, what you are pleaſed to call, beauty has had upon him. I know what I am, and at how great a diſtance the misfortunes of my family place me from him. I am bound by the ties of gratitude and reſpect to the princeſs, his mother; and if my eyes have had the misfortune to pleaſe
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:022876_0218_0FBA9CA791AFB9A8"/>
him, my heart has had no ſhare in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. Therefore tell him I beſeech him to forget me. Timander here again preſſed me to receive the billet he had obtained leave to bring me; and the perſon, whoſe care I was under, bidding me take and read it, I accordingly opened it, and found theſe words.</p>
                  <p>"Nothing, madam, but the paſſion you have inſpired in me can exceed the affliction I am under. Expreſſions are too poor for what I feel. You are perſecuted for my ſake, and your ſufferings alone cauſe all the tortures that diſtract me. I now diſcover my love without diſguiſe or reſerve, a boldneſs I bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row from the innocence of my intentions; and as every thing oppoſes my deſigns, my deſires become the more inflamed, and my reſolutions the better confirmed. Are not you formed, madam, to be loved? In you I find all my excuſes.—When a man loves as much as I do, the greateſt pleaſure he can feel, is to find that he loves with the juſteſt reaſon; and this, madam, is a ſatisfaction I muſt owe you all the moments of my life."</p>
                  <p>Well, madam, ſays Timander, will you not favour us with an anſwer to this billet? —I do not think it at all proper, anſwered I.—Why ſo, added he, you are not forbid it? —My duty to myſelf, returned I, forbids it.</p>
                  <p>After an hour's converſation he took his leave, and deſired to know what he ſhould tell the prince? Tell him, ſaid I, that I have a grateful heart, and am moved with
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:022876_0219_0FBA9CAA43258EA8"/>
his ſorrow; but that, in the circumſtances we are in, the beſt thing for him to do is, to think no more of me, and for me to forget him, if I can. He went back to the prince with this anſwer, which did not ſeem to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe him.</p>
                  <p>Returning to my chamber, I read the prince's letter over again with a concern of tenderneſs, which would have given him the higheſt ſatisfaction. Not long after this meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, I heard he was upon his departure for the army. His mother had procured him the moſt ſplendid equipage in the world, and purchaſed him one of the firſt poſts in the army. She was, by this, opening a door to honors, and he was ſetting out with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction in the road to glory. Timander called once more upon me before his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and brought this ſecond letter.</p>
                  <p>"I am departing for the army, madam. I muſt anſwer the call of glory to reach the throne of love, and become worthy of you. I therefore fancy you are the prize I am going to conquer.—But alas! love is not to be merited, and I muſt abandon myſelf to a grief worthy of your abſence and my heart. Do but think, madam, that I am without you; that will be ſufficient to deſerve your pity.—I would ſacrifice my life to my evil ſtars, but that I know it is conſecrated to you, and love will claim an account of it at my hands."</p>
                  <p>Timander painted, in the livelieſt colours,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:022876_0220_0FBA9CAB502AAFE8"/>
the diſtreſs the prince was in. The picture affected me prodigiouſly. I felt my boſom rent by a thouſand different agitations. I thought myſelf vaſtly indebted to him: I had hopes, fears, and even deſires; yet all theſe paſſions were not well diſtinguiſhed in my ſoul. I was flattered with the prince's love; but then again I was too much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded of the diſtance between him and me. This ſtartled my pride, and, when ſelf-opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion took up the ſcales to weigh our merits, I own I did not find myſelf ſo vaſtly beneath him. It is true, I might indeed have renounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an alliance I was made to buy at too high a price, but in the attempt the prince's love and diſtreſs ſtopped me ſhort.—He was ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing his greatneſs to me, and I my pride to him. He had not been long in the army before he gave proofs of his bravery. In him courage was joined with a great ſhare of ſenſe and prudence (though the latter was ſtill confined to his head, and had not yet reached his heart) whilſt reading and reflection ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied his want of experience; all which gave reaſon to hope he would one day be a great general.</p>
                  <p>There was a great battle fought a few days after his arrival. The enemies finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves hard preſſed in the poſt they occupied, and fearing to be attacked in their intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, reſolved to be beforehand with us. Accordingly having made all the previous diſpoſitions to a battle, they fell upon us at
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:022876_0221_0FBA9CAE03F89230"/>
a time, when by their ſituation we would have thought they ſhould only have kept on the defenſive. However they came up like deſperadoes, determined to ſell dearly their lives, and victory had long remained doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, when the left wing, which my father commanded, began at laſt to give way. The prince, who was at the head of the infantry, flew immediately to his aſſiſtance. He found him wounded, fallen under his horſe, and all about him either dead, or put to flight. He ran to him, lifted him from the ground, re-mounted him on a ſpare horſe, bound up his wound with his handerchief, and rallying the troops, charged briſkly the enemy, routed them entirely, and obtained a complete vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, which coſt them all their artillery and baggage, beſides a great number of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners.</p>
                  <p>My father began to feel his hurt after he was out of the heat of the action, and was obliged to be carried to his tent, where the ſurgeons ſearched his wound, and found it very conſiderable. The firſt thing he did was, to enquire after the perſon to whom he owed his life, and being told that it was the prince who had thus ſaved him, he could not conquer his concern for being ſo greatly obliged to him: is it poſſible, ſaid he, that I muſt be ſo infinitely in his debt? All the time of his illneſs, the prince never ceaſed his generous offices; he ſent for the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſurgeons to dreſs his wound; had his
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:022876_0222_0FBA9CAF0ECE4C68"/>
own officers to wait on him, and more than once offered him his purſe, which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly refuſed to accept. Word was ſent me of my father's wound, how I owed his life to the prince, and of all the kind offices he had received from him during his illneſs. On this, the infinite regard and affection I had for ſo dear a parent, made me think I might ſend the prince my acknowledgments, without treſpaſſing againſt the rules or decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Accordingly, without conſulting any body, I wrote him the following letter.</p>
                  <p>"I don't think I tranſgreſs the laws of decency, by thus expreſſing the grateful ſenſe of my obligations to you for having preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a life ſo precious to me as is that of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whom I honor beyond all expreſſion. —Alas! Sir, muſt eſteem, gratitude, and natural ſentiments, all join to force a heart, which would have choſen to yield only to its inclination and your tenderneſs? Fame is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready wholly taken up with you. For this am I to thank glory alone, and muſt not love claim ſome ſhare of the debt?"</p>
                  <p>I feared a long while for my father's life; but at laſt he gave ſome hopes of a recovery, to haſten which he cauſed himſelf to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into the country, whither I followed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to wait on him, and employ my cares for a health that was ſo dear to me.</p>
                  <p>The prince returned covered with glory. He often came in a friendly manner to viſit my father, and I found him ſtill the ſame
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:022876_0223_0FBA9CB1977E86C0"/>
towards me as when we parted. I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the obligations I lay under, and the ſentiments of gratitude he could claim from me; but theſe expreſſions offended him. I muſt have no returns but from your heart, ſaid he: delicacy of ſentiments is an attendant of love, which quickens all its pleaſures, though it often prepares us many vexations. But what muſt become of me, if with ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſo natural, ſo ſtrong, and ſo fond as mine, you ſhould not anſwer them, and I could inſpire you with nothing but thoughts of gratitude?—Yet, replied I, I muſt not entertain any others.</p>
                  <p>There began now to be ſome talk of peace, and the prince, notwithſtanding his youth, held ſo diſtinguiſhed a rank, that he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into all the conſultations held upon that ſubject. They ended at laſt in a general pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification, and the prince took particular care to have my father included in the treaty. Accordingly, by virtue of a general amneſty, and a ſeparate article for our family, our eſtates were to be reſtored to us as well as the places my father held before the war, which he was left at liberty either to take poſſeſſion of again, or to accept of an equivalent in lieu thereof.</p>
                  <p>My father's health returned with the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of once more ſeeing his family in a flouriſhing condition. The peace occaſioned an univerſal joy throughout the kingdom, and nothing was thought of at court, but
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:022876_0224_0FBA9CB2EAD3EDA0"/>
the celebrating of it by feſtivals and rejoic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. My father now left the country to take a houſe in town, and ſet up an equipage ſuitable to his birth. As I was already paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed my childhood, he took me home, but deſired a lady of his acquaintance, who had loſt her huſband, and had ſuffered from the frowns of fortune, to come and live with us, and have an eye over my conduct. Her name was Leonora: I was ordered to ſhow her as much obedience as if ſhe were my mother: ſhe had a great ſhare of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, had ſeen the world, and took care that I did not ſtir a ſtep without her.</p>
                  <p>Very ſoon after I was preſented to the queen. Her majeſty received me with great kindneſs, treated me with diſtinction, and ſaid very handſome things of my perſon.</p>
                  <p>The whole winter ſeaſon was ſpent in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions. The queen was young, and had a taſte for pleaſures. There was not an aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly but what ſhe was ſo kind as to admit me into, and I ſhowed away with pretty good ſucceſs. Prince Camillus made likewiſe one at every ball that was given. He danced exceeding well; his perſon was above any Lord's at court, and the glory he had acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the late campaign, ſeemed to caſt a new luſtre on him. I had the ſatisfaction of hearing him praiſed, and he the pleaſure of finding his choice univerſally approved. Whenever we were dancing together, buſy whiſperings behind us declared how every
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:022876_0225_0FBA9CB5A34D5E68"/>
body agreed in pronouncing us made for one another.</p>
                  <p>The princeſs Valeria bore with impatience the figure I made at court, and the queen's kindneſs to me, but much more the prince's fondneſs. She fell into ſo deep a melancholy, that I could not help pitying her condition. Her paſſion glowed in her eyes; a ſecret lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guor was ſpread over her whole perſon; grief preyed upon her beauty; and, though Nature intended her fair, Love had now ordered it otherwiſe. She had handſome features, but a wan and pale look robbed them of all their charms.</p>
                  <p>She comforted herſelf by eaſing her mind to a young relation who lived with her, and had her confidence. One day as I was walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the palace-garden with Leonora, we eſpied the princeſs and her confidante enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into a pretty dark grove, upon which I propoſed to my friend to follow them. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly we ſtept after, and entered a ſide alley next to that where ſhe was ſitting with her companion. She ſpoke with heat enough to be heard. What ſaid ſhe, would you have me do with myſelf? I live but for him, and yet I ſhall never gain his love.—Forgive him this piece of levity, ſaid the other, he will ſoon return to you. How? replied Valeria, you would have me not concerned at his uſage! And you call levity a natural paſſion which he cannot reſiſt! A paſſion, to which he ſacrifices his love to me, his glory, his
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:022876_0226_0FBA9CB692971050"/>
fortune, and all he owes to the beſt of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers! My heart has too often found his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes: when we love, we forgive long; but you do not ſee him with eyes as intereſted as mine. What cold inſenſibility has he not ſhown for my pains!—There is a kind of meanneſs in feeling and ſuffering for thoſe that do not feel for us. I can no longer bear the rackings of my heart, and the ſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reproaches of my pride; I muſt, I will ſilence them, and fall upon ſome method worthy of me. What may that be? anſwered her relation. Why, to retire for ever from court, replied ſhe;—ſhe could not proceed further, a flood of tears interrupting her ſpeech.—Strange reſolution! anſwered her confidante; you would puniſh yourſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe another is guilty! Here night coming on, they withdrew.</p>
                  <p>I ſeemed ſo affected with the princeſs's af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, that Leonora could not help expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing her ſurpriſe. What! ſaid ſhe to me, muſt one enter into a rival's grief?—I never feared her, replied I, and, as I have had nothing to diſpute with her, I cannot now enjoy the ill-natured pleaſure of triumphing in her diſtreſs. The prince's heart was ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered me without my wiſhing or deſiring it, and therefore, as ſhe gives me neither fear nor uneaſineſs, I cannot hate her. I have ſome ſhare of good-nature, and muſt pity her condition.</p>
                  <p>At my return home I found one of the
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:022876_0227_0FBA9CBA5AA47AF8"/>
queen's gentlemen, who brought me word, that ſhe had engaged me to an entertainment the king was to give, on account of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the princeſs Flavia, one of her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's relations; that in caſe I had not jewels enough, ſhe would ſend me ſome, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to know what I might want. I told him, I had a ſuit of green velvet and gold, which would do very well with a ſet of rubies, if I could get them. I withdrew afterwards to prepare my dreſs, and, out of complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance to her majeſty, took more pains about it than otherwiſe I would have done.</p>
                  <p>The day appointed for this magnificent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment was ſpent in all manner of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions. There was a play acted in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which was followed by a grand ſupper and a ball; and nothing in the world could be more gallant and better conducted. The princeſs Flavia looked perfectly charming: for, though ſhe is not a regular beauty, ſhe has ſo much youth and bloom, with ſo beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful a colour, that ſhe may ſurpaſs others handſomer than herſelf.</p>
                  <p>About the middle of the ball there was a great ſtir at the door, which engaged the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and eyes of the whole company. It was the duke of Praxede who was juſt arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving from the army. His coming was quite unexpected; he had made a ſhining campaign, had beaten the enemy, and entered the room with an air of confidence, ſupported by his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural valour and good mien. I had never
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:022876_0228_0FBA9CBD3A52FC08"/>
ſeen him before: he was not better acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with me; and, in caſting his eyes towards me, I heard him ſay ſome very fine things. His words, his looks, and the very found of his voice threw my ſoul into an agitation, which I had never felt before. The prince and he were then at variance; they were both driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards the ſame goal, and each other's rivals in glory and merit; upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count they had been ſeparated, and the court had not thought fit to employ them both in the ſame army.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as he arrived, the princeſs Flavia offered him her hand to dance: he took me next, but I was ſo confuſed, that had I dared, I would have refuſed his civility.</p>
                  <p>All the time the ball laſted, he kept his eyes conſtantly on me: I turned mine from him, and would fain refuſe him my looks, as a favour he had no right to. However he took me ſeveral times to dance, and made himſelf ſo remarkable, that it was thought he did it on purpoſe to ſpite the prince. You may be ſure I had no ſhare in the deſign, and indeed, as ſoon as the ball was over, I ran home in great haſte, and the prince left the company to conduct me.</p>
                  <p>"Your charms, madam, ſaid he, (when at liberty to ſpeak) operate on every body, and the duke of Praxede comes to ſwell the number of your conqueſts. Indeed, Sir, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied I, his affecting to take me ſo often to dance, and his ſtaring at me has given me
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:022876_0229_0FBA9CBE15942798"/>
a great deal of uneaſineſs.—But why ſo, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam? anſwered her. So much care, never to caſt a look towards him, ſhows that you dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his eyes, and was diffident of your own. A perſon that feels nothing, is always free and open; and over-acting our part, on certain occaſions, often betrays a conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of not being always right.—But, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied I, what would you quarrel with me about? I never ſaw him before in my life.— That may be, anſwered he again, but he has has ſeen you, and you were handſomer than uſual to-day: nay, he loves you, and that alone, even though you were not guilty, is enough to make me wretched."</p>
                  <p>Ever after this the prince watched me with a caution that gave me offence. The duke on his part followed me every where, and I always found him ready to catch my looks in all public places. The prince was informed of all his ſteps; he became peeviſh and ſuſpicious, and, though he could lay nothing to my charge, yet he was not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with me. He thought the duke very inſolent to pretend to a perſon, to whom he had been ſo long engaged; but for my part, I own I fancied he wanted only to teaze and alarm the prince, and believed, that, he thought if I could not ſerve the purpoſe of his heart, I might at leaſt gratify his vanity. Such a notion was highly offenſive to me, and therefore I ſhunned him carefully. The prince himſelf took notice of this; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:022876_0230_0FBA9CBF92F86260"/>
I opened my mind to him one day, telling him I could not believe I was any ways concerned in his grief, ſince, were it ſo, it would be doing me the higheſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice; to which he anſwered, "You do not indeed ſeem to join with the duke againſt me; you avoid him, and ſhow me even a greater regard than ever, and yet you are guilty: nay, you are ſo without knowing it, and you would fain, by an increaſe of kindneſs, make amends for the wrongs you are doing me.—Good Heavens, cried I, what then is my crime!—You love the duke, anſwered he: yes, Mademoiſelle, you doat on him, and 'tis I that muſt inform you thereof, I know I am going to appear whimſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and ridiculous, and juſtify all your wrongs. I provide you with weapons againſt myſelf, which you will turn to a proper uſe. I ſee and feel the whole of my wretchedneſs, but I am driven to it." All this was attended by a flood of tears, and taking leave he told me further, that he was going to conceal his diſtraction and deſpair from my ſight.</p>
                  <p>He left me in a greater confuſion than I can well deſcribe: I found I wanted to ſhake off myſelf, and durſt not yet enquire into the cauſe of the various emotions, I felt raiſed in my breaſt; when having thrown myſelf on a couch, Leonora entered the room.</p>
                  <p>I was ſurpriſed at her coming, and aſhamed ſhe ſhould be witneſs of my diſorder. Which
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:022876_0231_0FBA9CC110F80E20"/>
ſhe perceiving, Come, ſaid ſhe, recover yourſelf: I ſee you would conceal your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs and ſentiments from my knowledge; but you are to blame. Don't take me for a ſevere cenſor, that would condemn all your motions, but look upon me as a friend on whom you may depend, and one capable of comforting and conducting you in the moſt delicate circumſtance of your life. Do not fancy I ſhall make a crime of your ſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. A heart may be ſenſible and innocent too; and, to merit your confidence, by my example, I am willing to let you into mine." Here ſhe pauſed a while, and ſeemed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent having gone ſo far; but I preſſed her with ſo much tenderneſs to proceed in her ſtory, that ſhe continued thus:</p>
                  <p>I am acquainted with love, and have but too dearly paid the tribute due to that little god. You have no doubt heard of the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes of my family, and how I loſt my huſband and brother both at the ſame time. The one was the ſupport, and the other the hope of our houſe. My brother was taken in arms againſt his ſovereign, and left his head upon a ſcaffold. Soon after my huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band paid with his life a victory he gained over the enemies of the ſtate. Thus was I in one moment ſtript of all my preſent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages and hopes to come; reduced to lament a dead huſband in place, and much eſteemed, and to ſue for a brother's life and honor: but, alas! he forfeited both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:022876_0232_0FBA9CC5554AD228"/>
with his eſtates, ſo that I was left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wealth or fortune. The notions of greatneſs diſappeared, and all the charms that are the attendants of a diſtinguiſhed ſtation in life vaniſhed in an inſtant. I found myſelf forſaken and without ſupport, and my only hopes were, that, having been expoſed to the frowns of fortune, I ſhould at leaſt be forgotten by love; but both joined forces to perſecute me. Diſpenſe me, madam, with the reſt—</p>
                  <p>And now, ladies, though every thing ſhe ſaid is ſtill freſh in my memory, from my having been very attentive to this mark of confidence ſhe gave me (wherein ſhe acted very artfully to come at my heart and ſecret) yet as ſhe is unknown to you, the repetition will not perhaps be thought very material, therefore you will give me leave to drop her hiſtory here.—By no means, ſaid we all, pray let us know the reſt of Leonora's adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; whereupon the Solitary continued in theſe words:</p>
                  <p>—We like to be let into the weakneſſes of people we eſteem. We always long to reſemble them in ſomething; if their emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent qualities leave us far behind, their foi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles bring us to a nearer affinity. That is no ſmall comfort, and in my particular cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, it was too important for my repoſe, to find a friend in a perſon who had been ſet as a watch over my actions. The confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſhe was going to place in me, was a
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:022876_0233_0FBA9CC7397E3B30"/>
kind of ſecurity that anſwered for her, and I was in thoſe moments, when a ſecret lies ſo heavy on the heart. I longed to ſpeak to her of what I felt, and was too happy to find in her, not only advices for my conduct, but the ſame dear weakneſſes which render us more indulgent towards thoſe of other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, I preſſed her therefore to proceed.</p>
                  <p>You will then, ſaid ſhe, have the full extent of my ſecret. I am very much afraid the recital will make all my wounds bleed afreſh, and give new life to my paſſion; but howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that ſhall not prevent my complying with your requeſt. My ſentiments being the only pleaſure left me, I will indulge them in their full career. They are indeed of a quite new nature. Olindo in Taſſo is quoted as a model of ſentiments. He is made to ſay, that he deſires much, hopes little, and aſks nothing; but for my part I neither wiſh, hope, nor aſk at all. My paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is ſupported by nothing; it ſubſiſts, feeds, and increaſes by itſelf: and thus have I for a long time been taken up with a ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment moſt ſingular in its kind.</p>
                  <p>I ſaw at a friend's ſome years ago the count ***, you will excuſe me telling his name. To me he appeared a moſt amiable perſon, though, with ſo great ſhare of the qualifications of the mind, perſonal advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages would be leſs requiſite. From the firſt moment I beheld him he engaged my atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (which is doing a great deal with me)
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:022876_0234_0FBA9CC891A37CD8"/>
and I continued ſeeing him both at my friend's and my own houſe. There was at that time a gentleman that laid ſome preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to my heart. We had formerly been on the point of marriage, and, when my family had diſpoſed of my liberty in favour of my late huſband, he had been afflicted beyond expreſſion. His ſtars had decreed he ſhould ever love me; therefore, unable yet to reſolve to give me over, he ſtill di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted his ſorrow with the notion that my heart did not go along with my hand. His eſteem and reſpect for me had indeed ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and repreſſed his ſentiments, but he was ever watching mine, and telling me every day, that, if I diſpoſed of them to another, he ſhould die with grief.</p>
                  <p>He ſoon obſerved, that my regard for the count was changing into tenderneſs; my eyes had informed againſt me, and revealed my ſecret: and upon this he vented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in reproaches that very much offended me.</p>
                  <p>All this was yet unperceived by the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py man. Not but that he ſeemed to have ſome ſlender inclination for me, and I was ready prepared to reject his declaration, if he ſhould make any. He has ſince been fully revenged for my idle reſolution. If he had any ſentiments at all, they have ſtopt ſhort, whilſt mine have had their full run. It was long before I could be clear in what I felt. Heavens! how artfully doth
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:022876_0235_0FBA9CCA36373620"/>
the heart in thoſe caſes conceal its inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not to alarm our reaſon and modeſty? It is a bare nothing at firſt: it is the mind we are taken with; and, in ſhort, till love has got the maſtery, he remains almoſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways unknown. He ſoon diſcovered himſelf to me in all his power; and the diſorder, which the preſence of the count always threw me into, made me ſenſible of my defeat.</p>
                  <p>About that time all my misfortunes came ſhowering upon me, and, as I have told you, I loſt my huſband and brother. It was the moſt complete and ſtrongeſt felt diſtreſs in the world. My friend, who often came to comfort me, uſed to bring the count with her at a time when I ſaw no body; and I found, to the ſhame of my grief, that he alone was able to ſuſpend it.</p>
                  <p>I was afterwards plunged into a world of affairs; my family ruined; my brother pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing with all the infamy of guilt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and none but I to aſſiſt him, and ſave all I could out of the ruins of the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. I was in hopes that ſo many troubles would at leaſt wear out the ſentiment I nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in my heart, but my misfortunes ever kept up a ſtrong remembrance of it.</p>
                  <p>After many years vexation, time, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of reaſon, effected what the latter had not been able to compaſs; for we muſt own, to the ſhame of our affliction, that it doth not laſt for ever. In ſhort, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made the moſt of the wrecks of my
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:022876_0236_0FBA9CCBEE356438"/>
fortune, I hoped to enjoy a little quiet. But I had loſt the repoſe of the heart, and, when reſtored to myſelf, I found I was wholly funk in love. An active hurrying life had, indeed, encroached on its rights; but I have paid dear for it ſince. I could no longer miſtake my ſituation; I was forced to own it, and begin to ſettle with myſelf.</p>
                  <p>Moſt women, void of thought or deſign of action, are hurried away by the firſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent that pleaſes them. But for my part I conſidered what I had to do, and, after weighing the count's character and my own, found that I muſt abſolutely avoid him: and, to ſhow you that my reſolution was grounded on knowledge, I will draw you his picture.—But no; I am not in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to paint him ſuch as he is. Love would needs conduct the pencil, and I could not ſuffer any want of merit in the object of my affections.</p>
                  <p>But, ſaid I, interrupting her, how is it poſſible that with a heart, overflowing with ſo great a paſſion, you ſhould have made no attempts towards either inſpiring the ſame in his, or expreſſing your own to him?—I have my anſwer ready, replied ſhe.</p>
                  <p>I was born with a heart greatly ſuſceptible of tenderneſs, but yet at the ſame time with a deal of pride. The one cannot be grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied but at the expenſe of the other. To make me happy, they ought both to agree, which is a difficult matter; and my condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:022876_0237_0FBA9CCD529BA430"/>
is ſtill more miſerable when my glory is wounded, than when my heart bleeds; and I have therefore reſolved to gratify it. Had I ſhown my ſentiments, and they been ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I ſhould have died with grief; and that was my reaſon for avoiding him. I was ſure of my lips, but could not anſwer for my eyes; and yet, whilſt I was ſhunning his looks, I was ever ſeeking for them. What ſtorm would they not raiſe in my ſoul, when my eyes happened to glance on him! My tenderneſs and pride always ſtepped in between him and me. The one forced me towards him, the other with-held my fondneſs; and theſe different impreſſions gave me a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed and baſhful air, which I was afraid might betray me. Yet there is not one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my life, wherein my heart doth not require, and I refuſe him to its eager deſires. My ſentiments are as violent now, as when new; and more than once an increaſe of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs has exhauſted the whole ſtock of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage I had collected by reflection. My thoughts are ſtill on him without intermiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He falls in between every object and me; in all the projects I form, I have him ſtill in view: I fancy his eſteem is to be the reward of all the good I do, and I prize it yet more than all the tender ſentiments I am able to ſuppoſe in him. I have ſet myſelf the hardeſt taſk in the world, a ſtrictneſs of behaviour that denies me even the pleaſures of imagination; but eſpecially, I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:022876_0238_0FBA9CD047FD22B0"/>
to avoid him, and accordingly keep my word with myſelf.</p>
                  <p>One heart alone is unequal to ſo mighty a ſtruggle; and a friend who viſited me of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, ſeeing me penſive and melancholy, at laſt wreſted my ſecret from me. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion coſt me as much as if it had been ſomething criminal. He endeavoured to quiet my timorouſneſs, and ſaid—Do you think we owe as much fidelity to this whim of honor impoſed by cuſtom, as to the other which is the real attendant of virtue? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me, madam, the world is not too hard, you owe it but the appearances of decorum, no more is required of you.—I cannot be of your way of thinking, anſwered I, and I have never met with a woman good for any thing, after once throwing off the prejudice of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor. Beſides, I have more regard for myſelf than for the world: I ſtand in need of my own good opinion, and the teſtimony of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is more neceſſary to me, than all the ſuffrages of the public.—But will you, ſaid he again, fall a ſacrifice to your paſſion? You muſt either get the better of, or yield to it. —If my heart could have obeyed me, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied I, I ſhould have got rid of it long ago, but I can bring it to no manner of terms. Nay, ſcarce can I forgive my ſenſibility, and it is you that have recalled me to the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I owe myſelf.</p>
                  <p>But after all, madam, an inclination is not a thing that depends on us; it inſinuates
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:022876_0239_0FBA9CD2AEDA3788"/>
into our hearts without our leave: paſſions ſeize and hold us in their power as long as they pleaſe, and the whole guilt lies in the uſe we make of them. What have I not done to tear him from my heart? I attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to leave my native country, and go over to a foreign court. I thought change of place and objects, might give a new turn to my ideas; but love, more diligent than me, flew and overtook me on the road. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore that all my precautions were uſeleſs, and my affairs requiring my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence at home, I returned back. Next I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to force myſelf into a liking to ſome perſons that made their addreſſes to me, hoping to weaken one paſſion by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and thus at laſt to give them both the ſlip. But, alas! all to no purpoſe. I have ſacrificed every thing to my imaginary love, and my fidelity to this phantaſm of a paſſion, is proof againſt all. It is really wonderful what lengths I have gone with this mere idea. I have perſonalized it, ſo that I keep a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial intercourſe with it; nay, we have our quarrels and reconciliations: at other times again we are upon eaſier terms, and, my melancholy being then more ſoothing, I would not barter it for the higheſt gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of pleaſure. It is love alone that can give thoſe endearing fits of ſadneſs which we enjoy with thanks. My ideas are ſo ſtrong, that there are moments when I fancy
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:022876_0240_0FBA9CD3D3A01BE0"/>
him near me, and love wears away the whole ſpace that ſeparates us.</p>
                  <p>Would you know what has led me to this exceſs of paſſion? It is my extreme ſeverity to myſelf. It is not thoſe that yield, who love moſt, but thoſe who reſiſt. All you deny the ſenſes, adds to the hoard of tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. I was let looſe to the exaggerations of my mind, and, as poſſeſſion ſeldom fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes all the gratifications our deſires lend it, I have loved not in proportion to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit I have found, but to that which I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined.</p>
                  <p>I heard much about that time, that the count had an affair with a lady; a new ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to my grief. My paſſion, I fancied, gave me a right over his. When we love dearly, we would fain be loved again, and always fancy ourſelves worthy of ſuch a return. I was as much piqued at his amour, as if he had really been guilty of an infidelity to me, and his affection for another raiſed a barrier betweeen him and me. From his engagement he ſhifted to another. From thence I fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied he was inconſtant, and neither ſerious nor reſpectful of love, and I found I was doomed to the laborious taſk of effacing from my heart a ſentiment that was deeply engraven in it. But, alas! even now, a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times a day I ſay I will forget him, and ſay it, but to think ſtill more of him. What muſt I do with the vaſt ſtock of love thus ſwelling in my heart? Lovers are often cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:022876_0241_0FBA9CD5555B02B0"/>
by reflections; but mine diſtemper me the more, and reaſon is too weak to aſſiſt me againſt my paſſion.—But it is too much expatiating upon what I feel. What, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, muſt you now think of me? Or what impreſſions does my madneſs make upon you?—Think! replied I, why, that it is a ſort of conſolation to find ſo eſtimable a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as you, in ſome ſhape, partaking of my weakneſs.—</p>
                  <p>After all this, now ſuffer me, madam, reſumed ſhe, to do my office, (for it is what we muſt do ſometimes;) by deſiring you to conſider, that, though I have not fallen into the greateſt precipices of love, I have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs been exceſſively miſerable. From a conduct tolerably laudable, what advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages have I reaped? Myſelf the only wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſo many difficulties and ſtrugglings. In love every thing of this nature is loſt, becauſe unknown, beſides that the heart is never well compoſed again after having been once agitated with that paſſion. How ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and deſirable is virtue, even barely with regard to our repoſe! Take the moſt fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate paſſions, and ſum up, if poſſible, all the alarms, the pangs, the anxieties, the fears, the jealouſies that attend them: lay all theſe aſide, and leave to love none but its pure joys; how few will they appear? Yet, for the ſhadow of theſe few pleaſures, we vitiate our taſte, and loſe the reliſh of true pleaſures for all our lives. Pardon, madam,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:022876_0242_0FBA9CD6D0592288"/>
this ſmall touch of morality. If, by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing myſelf open to you as I have now done, I have forfeited the privilege of giving ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, I hope by a mutual confidence to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain a new right to your heart, and make myſelf believed a friend free from ſuſpicion.</p>
                  <p>Here I was going, in return, to unboſom my ſoul to her, in full liberty, in regard to my ſituation, when we were told that my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wanted us. Having waited on him, he aſked me in a rough angry tone, what I had done to prince Camillus? "His mother has been telling me this moment, continued he, that he grieves moſt terribly, and you are taxed with being the cauſe of it: it is very cutting, ſays ſhe to me, firſt to bear ſo much againſt my will, my ſon's paſſion for your daughter, and then to find that very paſſion ſerves but to make him unhappy. I believe you too much my friend, not to join with me in breaking an engagement which is not at all agreeable to me, and you are too much a man of honor not to think rather of ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling the duties of gratitude, than of ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grandizing your family at the expenſe of the friendſhip you owe me. Since, therefore, your daughter helps us by her ill-treatment of my ſon, let us, concluded ſhe, complete a rupture, which we durſt not have attempted without her concurrence; and for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I beg of you to carry, or ſend her down into the country. I anſwered, that I deſired her to be perſuaded that no intereſts were
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:022876_0243_0FBA9CDBF9505148"/>
dearer to me than her own; that I had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more at heart than to give her ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and that I ſhould immediately order you away. Therefore, Mademoiſelle, get your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ready to ſet out for my country ſeat in two or three days. The gratitude and fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity I owe the princeſs prevent my talking to you in the ſtrain of an offended father, but I had rather ſerve her than you. Certainly, purſued he, turning to Leonora, who had followed me, nothing can come up to my daughter's ingratitude to an amiable prince, who has a violent paſſion for her, who ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices the greateſt advantages to his love, and is the ſupport of our tottering family. When the princeſs, his mother, out of indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to him and kind regard to me, is going give a conſent which coſts her ſo much, ſhe, my daughter, alone raiſes an obſtacle to an affair, which ſhe ought to buy at the expenſe of half her life!—Oh! in ſpite of reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I ſhall loſe my temper, anger reſumes its rights, and will have vent! Begone, and never more appear in my ſight." I would have anſwered, but he was too much exaſperated, and I found the beſt way was to withdraw immediately to my chamber. Leonora ſtaid however ſome time behind to try to pacify him, but his paſſion ran ſo high, and his rage was ſo violent, that ſhe found it a hard matter to calm him.</p>
                  <p>That very moment the prince came to pay him a viſit, and finding him prodigiouſly
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:022876_0244_0FBA9CDCD29A15C0"/>
ruffled, aſked him the reaſon of his diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure: "My daughter, replied the old gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, has been unhappy enough to diſpleaſe you, for which I cannot puniſh her too much, and therefore have juſt now ordered her away into the country." The prince imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately threw himſelf at his feet to beg I might be allowed to ſtay, but my father re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that his word was too ſtrongly enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to the princeſs ever to go from it. The prince aſſured him I was no ways guilty: "Muſt parents, ſaid he, interfere in the quarrels of lovers, which have often no other foundation but their delicacy? It is I, ſir, that am in fault. Love is never ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and often unjuſt. But at leaſt give me leave to ſee your daughter.—You have it, my lord, replied my father.—Well then, continued the prince, I will go to my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and entreat her to deſire you herſelf to break off this cruel journey.—Were ſhe even to order it, anſwered my father, it would be all to no purpoſe. She might think you and I are of a party in it; and I owe more to my honor than to any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration whatever."</p>
                  <p>Leonora had withdrawn, when ſhe ſaw the prince enter my father's cloſet, though not ſo far but ſhe overheard this part of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, after which ſhe came up to my room, where ſhe found me ſinking under a dejection of ſpirits that cannot be expreſſed. "O my dear, cried I, my father's anger diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:022876_0245_0FBA9CDE634A7450"/>
me; but what afflicts me moſt is, that he is not angry without a cauſe. Alas! but a moment ago you were talking of the trials of love: could I have thought I was deſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be ſo ſoon an inſtance of them?" Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora on this repeated to me what the prince had ſaid to my father, but his generoſity and virtue ſerved only to add to my guilt and affliction.</p>
                  <p>The prince that moment entered my room, and finding me drowned in tears;—though I am ignorant of the cauſe of thoſe tears, ſaid he, and dare not flatter myſelf they are meant for me, yet, madam, you are afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that is a ſufficient motive for me to partake in your ſorrow.—My lord, replied I, abandon a wretched creature that diſturbs the tranquillity of your family: do not add your conſtancy to my load of misfortunes. You have already done too much for me, and it is time to think of yourſelf, and what you owe the princeſs your mother.—Why will you, madam, anſwered he, ever take upon you the care of my duty? It no longer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes you to affect ſuch a generoſity. This laſt ſpeech offended me.—What, ſir, do you mean by this, ſaid I, and what am I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of?—I accuſe you of nothing, replied the prince, and you will never find a perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor in me. In the piques of lovers, the delicacy of the perſon in fault is always ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient revenge to the injured; I aſk no other: but at leaſt, Mademoiſelle, help us
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:022876_0246_0FBA9CE01118CCF0"/>
not to loſe you. I have not been able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with your father. It is the firſt time in my life I have ſeen him angry with you, and I muſt die with grief, if he continues much longer in the ſame temper.</p>
                  <p>Here I was told that one of the princeſs Flavia's gentlemen wanted to ſpeak with me. He brought me word that her highneſs had engaged me for a party of hunting the next day. I deſired Leonora to go and know my father's pleaſure what I muſt do. His an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was—To be ſure ſhe muſt obey the princeſs: ſince ſhe has done her the honor to name her for the party, ſhe ought to go. —I therefore ſent the gentleman back with my thanks to the princeſs, and to aſſure her I would not fail to comply with her orders.</p>
                  <p>I was now obliged to get my things rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and think of my dreſs, but indeed I was very little diſpoſed for joy. One of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences of a court is, that we muſt have the ſentiments that reign there, or do as if we had them; ſo that, often under an outward appearance of mirth, the inward anguiſh of the heart is concealed.</p>
                  <p>I joined the company the next day with a very heavy heart, but diſſembled my unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs by ſaying I had had a violent head-ach. Nothing in the world could be more gallant than our hunting match, which was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with an entertainment at a pleaſure ſeat in the country. The ladies made a very fine appearance on horſeback. My father, who
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:022876_0247_0FBA9CE39D1ABAB8"/>
neglected nothing that could give an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of graces to my perſon, had made me learn to ride, and my dreſs was blue trimmed with gold. I was liked better than I could have wiſhed, and the princeſs, who was very obliging, complimented me upon it in the handſomeſt manner in the world. The firſt perſons my eyes glanced on were the prince and the duke, very regularly paying their court to her highneſs. My confuſion was inexpreſſible: I was at a loſs how to diſpoſe of my looks; the prince was obſerving me, and that increaſed my diſorder.</p>
                  <p>The chace began at laſt, and the duke contrived means to get near me. When he came up, I expreſſed ſo much uneaſineſs at his ſight, that he withdrew very reſpectfully, ſaying, I hope, then, madam, you will take for done, all the ſervices I do not render you.</p>
                  <p>When the ſport was over, the company repaired to a country ſeat, which was finely illuminated; and, as ſoon as they arrived, the ladies withdrew to the apartments pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for them, in order to refreſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſhift their dreſſes. Here, pull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out my handkerchief, I found a letter in my pocket, without being able to know how it came there; and, juſt as I was reading it, the prince ſtepped in to my chamber. I hid it in a great hurry, but he perceived my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and ſaid to me, I find, madam, I am troubleſome, and ſhall therefore withdraw.
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:022876_0248_0FBA9CE517D31F00"/>
The time was now come for my evil deſtiny to prevail over my life.</p>
                  <p>When I had changed cloaths, I was oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to go down to the company. How dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult a matter it is to put on a pleaſant air with a bleeding heart! In the courſe of the converſation I told the princeſs I was going down into the country. She aſked me upon what account; I replied, my father was willing to ſpend a few weeks of the ſpring at his ſeat, and aſſured her I ſhould carry with me the moſt grateful ſenſe of the obligations I lay under to her goodneſs. She inquired like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe how far the houſe might be; and upon my telling her that it was but two or three leagues off, ſhe had the complaiſance to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to come down and ſee me. I received all theſe marks of diſtinction as I ought. The duke was preſent when I mentioned my journey, and ſeemed to expreſs a concern. But as for the prince, he did not appear the whole evening, which gave me much uneaſineſs. The company went to cards; there was alſo a concert in the drawing-room, whither I followed the princeſs, becauſe I found my account better with the muſic: for there I had nothing to do but feel and be ſilent. Supper was ſerved up; every thing was in the moſt magnificent taſte; and there was a grand ball after.</p>
                  <p>The duke made the moſt brilliant and graceful appearance in the world at this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:022876_0249_0FBA9CE6B95769B0"/>
and I own I found myſelf poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with quite new ſentiments, which I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived very well were thoſe the prince had been ſo long requiring of me in his behalf, but which till then I had been utterly unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with. Though I was very ſorry not to ſee him, becauſe his abſence was a ſure ſign of his diſcontent, yet I could not help find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing myſelf more at eaſe for a moment: my looks and ſentiments had a greater liberty of action, and I ſaw with ſorrow, though not without a mixture of joy, the moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent paſſion written in the duke's eyes. Whenever I happened to be his partner, he was thought to dance better than uſual, and the princeſs made us repeat together ſeveral dances, which ſhe fancied we performed better than the reſt.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, he was endeavouring to pleaſe, and was, perhaps, very ſenſible that he did ſo.</p>
                  <p>After the ball was over, I hurried home to my apartment, whither Leonora, who had been ſo kind as to keep always with me, alſo followed. As ſoon as I ſaw her, I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered my maids to retire, and then ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to tell me, how dearly I was like to pay for the moment's pleaſure I had had. I gave her an account of all that had paſſed, but ſhe knew it better than myſelf, having obſerved me all the time. I ſhowed her the letter I had received, and told her how the prince had ſurpriſed me reading it, and that no doubt he ſuſpected it came from the duke of
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:022876_0250_0FBA9CE81B2BC7B0"/>
Praxede. Indeed, anſwered ſhe, you are to be pitied, madam; but what can be done for you? We ſpent part of the night in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting upon the different methods I could take, but day-light appearing before we could fix on any, we went to our beds un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſolved.</p>
                  <p>The prince called upon Leonora betimes in the morning: it is perhaps ill-mannerly, madam, ſaid he, to come ſo early to diſturb people that go to bed by day-light. He had, it ſeems, paſſed the night on a terrace that lay under my window, and had ſeen how late we had ſat up together; he knew alſo all that had happened at the ball, having been preſent in diſguiſe. He expreſſed a lively and deep concern to Leonora, telling her how he had caught me reading a letter, which, upon ſight of him, I had put up with a diſorder that had betrayed me; and, upon my friend's endeavouring to diſſuade him from the notions he had formed of that let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he anſwered, I do not ſeek to accuſe her, and ſhould be very ſorry to have any cauſe to do it. Alas! far from it: ſo great was my good opinion of her ſincerity, that ſhe might have attempted any thing upon the ſtrength of my confidence.—What then is it you complain of, replied Leonora, what hath ſhe done more than common civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity required? (for, as to the letter affair, ſhe made him believe he was miſtaken, and folks in love are eaſily deceived) I cannot, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:022876_0251_0FBA9CE9F68B5160"/>
he, ground either my ſuſpicions, or even my diſcontent, on any thing certain; but a ſecret foreboding diſturbs my heart: my fears are not quieted by her love, and, when ſhe is with the duke, methinks I ſee in her eyes a ſomething ſhe never hath with me. Leonora was not wanting in her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to calm thoſe apprehenſions. He begged her to obtain leave of my father to viſit me in the country, and aſſured her at parting, that his ſuſpicions and uneaſineſſes on my account ſhould never reach him, and that he would owe nothing to paternal au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, nor accept of my hand if my heart did not tender it.</p>
                  <p>The prince having obtained the liberty he deſired, I ſat out without daring to take leave of my father, and under his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure I found myſelf more eaſy in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Our ſeat was a noble building, though not in the modern taſte: there was a large park, fine woods, and pleaſant water. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſeemed every where at liberty, without being forced by art. I was in hopes that the calm tranquillity that reigned in this place might diffuſe itſelf into my ſoul: but, alas! the paſſions delight in ſilence, they increaſe and ſtrengthen by ſolitude. I found myſelf with diſpoſitions till then unknown, and in a diſorder and agitation, which nevertheleſs had a ſecret charm.</p>
                  <p>Leonora often intruded upon my ſolitary moments to rouze me out of my reveries,
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:022876_0252_0FBA9CEB5D52E988"/>
and obligingly reproach me with ſhunning her. Then, ſaid I, I muſt alſo ſhun myſelf, for you are my ſole comfort. But the truth is, that all my time is not ſufficient to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow on what I feel of late —Your reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, anſwered ſhe, might be better employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the misfortunes love has in ſtore for you. I know my advices will be in vain againſt a growing paſſion, but, though uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, I ſtill owe them to you: conſider, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, continued ſhe, that you are wanting to every thing that is moſt ſacred, to your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to your father, and what is ſtill more, to the moſt lovely prince in the world, and to the trueſt and beſt proved paſſion that ever was; and for whom? For one you do not know, and who will moſt aſſuredly render your life miſerable. You muſt not fancy that all paſſions carry their excuſes with them. —Here we were interrupted and parted. I was very ſenſible ſhe was in the right, but her reaſon and mine were both too weak to help me. She was threatening me with mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, and troubling my life, without ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually arming me againſt my evil deſtiny.</p>
                  <p>I do not know by what enchantment every thing about me ſerved the duke. I cannot tell whether he had bribed any of my people, but I met with marks of his paſſion in every place. Once I found a letter on my toilet; at other times verſes would be offered to my view in the woods and moſt bye places, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I liked to retire. Here is the letter I
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:022876_0253_0FBA9CEEBB6B4DC0"/>
have ſpoken of. At firſt I made a ſcruple of unfolding it; and, had it been poſſible, would have ſent it back, whence it came unopen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but we can hardly deny ourſelves a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that preſents itſelf, and the receiving of which is to be unknown. I therefore opened it, and read theſe words.</p>
                  <p>"I tremble, Mademoiſelle, to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, and am under a dread of your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure; yet what makes my crime, ought to be my excuſe.—I cannot forbear telling you that you have taught me to love, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing yourſelf thoſe tender ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments you have taught me. Though, were you to judge of yourſelf only by the paſſion you have inſpired in me, you could not be ignorant that you are the moſt adorable creature in the world. But by the infinite ſenſe I have of your worth, methinks I am ſtill placing you at a greater diſtance from me. I have a love and reſpect which you only can inſpire, and which no one but my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is capable of feeling."</p>
                  <p>The next day as I was going to ſit down by a large canal in a grove, I found this other letter on a ſeat of green turf, on which I uſed to reſt myſelf.</p>
                  <p>"You need not be under any fear on my account, Mademoiſelle. The ſentiments you have raiſed in me have all the warmth of paſſion, with the innocence of virtue. I dare glory in the avowing them, and will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I have no other merit but what is deriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:022876_0254_0FBA9CF00A8C6C98"/>
from them. Let the diſintereſtedneſs of my affection plead in its behalf; ſince there can be no greater proof of love, than to be more eager to love and to be loved again. For my part, I am rewarded for my paſſion by what I feel, and am pleaſed with the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of happier days: judge, then, madam, if I can ever fail of honoring and reſpecting you."</p>
                  <p>Another day this third billet was offered to my view in a cloſet, whither I uſed to retire.</p>
                  <p>"I paſs the days and nights under your walls, and, though I cannot live from the place that holds my bliſs, I know not how to approach; all the ways that lead to my charmer appear full of difficulties. But even this becomes an advantage, ſince finding you, at laſt, muſt claim ſome merit.—I cannot return to court; I have not power to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge my duty there:—and think, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you are not, I am obliged to no duty but that of regretting your abſence. Much leſs can I ſeek for pleaſure. Can any be found without you? I find at leaſt there is none for me in the world but where you are. In you alone, love has centered all my hopes, my wiſhes, and my pleaſures.—Will you not then, through pity, relieve what I ſuffer through love?"</p>
                  <p>Thus every thing ſpoke in his behalf, and was ever reminding me of what I could not forget. I believed eaſily the agreeable truths that cloſed with my deſires. He was by
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:022876_0255_0FBA9CF1D51E1CD8"/>
degrees uſing me to hear him talk of his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and inſenſibly gaining upon my deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy and baſhfulneſs, whilſt I allowed and forgave my loving him.</p>
                  <p>A few days after my arrival in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, the counteſs Emilia came to ſee me. She was a friend of the family's, and had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways expreſſed a high friendſhip for me. She brought with her a very amiable daughter, who, after the firſt acquaintance, obſerving that I was alone, and might be glad of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, offered very kindly to ſtay behind with me, if I would but aſk her mamma leave. At any other time I ſhould have been very glad of ſuch an offer, but I was now ſo melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, and ſo much taken up with my paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that, though ſometimes I endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to divert my thoughts, I ſtill fell into my old way, and my tenderneſs made me believe that I owed myſelf wholly and entirely to my ſenſations of love, and that to deviate from them was no better than an infidelity. However, I could not well decline aſking her of her mother, and therefore made the propoſal, which ſhe readily came into.</p>
                  <p>I diverted my new companion as well as I could. We ſoon contracted a familiarity with one another, and yet ſhe was not open with me, but ſeemed rather penſive and taken up with ſomething at heatt. I did not chooſe to let her know I perceived it, for fear of giving her uneaſineſs, nor preſs to be let into her ſecrets, becauſe I was glad
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:022876_0256_0FBA9CF36489AEF8"/>
her reſervedneſs towards me, gave me a right of behaving in the ſame manner to her. She would often be alone, which pleaſed me much, as I had thereby the liberty and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of being ſo too.</p>
                  <p>Going one day into her apartments, I was greatly ſurpriſed to find the duke with her, and I believe they both perceived the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order his preſence threw me into. At firſt I had a great mind to reſent it, but contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed myſelf upon reflection, that, not being acquainted with the ſecret of my heart, ſhe could mean no harm in introducing the duke. I could not hinder her from ſeeing her friends at my houſe, and the duke, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing of what I had ſuffered upon his account, could have no notion of diſoblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me by a viſit to a lady of his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Theſe reaſons calmed my reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment —I made but a ſhort ſtay with them, and ran immediately after to Leonora. I told her I had juſt ſeen the duke in my friend's apartment, and what concern it gave me, leſt my father and the prince ſhould think I had an hand in it, begging her to tell me what I had beſt do. She knew me too well to ſuſpect any artifice in my conduct. My fears anſwered for me; and ſhe knew I could feel, but that was all. She therefore told me ſhe would wait on my father with an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the whole of the matter, and would take his orders how to act, but that ſhe was pretty ſure he would ſuſpect nothing further.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="55" facs="unknown:022876_0257_0FBA9CF4D456F860"/>It fell out accordingly. He was perſuaded that it was a mere chance accident, and, that as it was not poſſible to turn out of doors a young lady of my friend's quality, ſo was it likewiſe impoſſible to prevent her receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what viſits ſhe pleaſed in her apartment; but he deſired her never to be one moment from me. They agreed alſo that he ſhould now and then take a trip down to us, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal from the world the knowledge of my diſgrace with him, and prevent people's talk about it to my diſadvantage.</p>
                  <p>Leonora's return made me eaſy as to my father, but I was certain all our precautions would avail nothing with the prince, and that he would not hearken to reaſon like the old gentleman. Going into my room, I found a letter laid upon a couch, and indeed few days paſſed without my receiving ſome, one way or another. I opened it, and read theſe words.</p>
                  <p>"I appear no more at court, Mademoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle, out of regard for my love. I cannot help thinking my paſſion is legible in my eyes, and by looking at me I fancy every body can diſcover that you are the perſon I adore.— What! muſt I make a ſecret of loving you? The only merit I would boaſt of is a high ſenſe of your value, and a reſpect equal to your worth.—My ſentiments, madam, want only to be felt, and I words to expreſs them."</p>
                  <p>Everafter I avoided going into my friend's apartment, but ſhe was fonder of my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:022876_0258_0FBA9CF7111B5948"/>
than ever. You ſhun me, ſaid ſhe, one day, you have found out the duke's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to you, and fancy me deep in ſome plot againſt you; but do me the juſtice to believe, that though he is very much my friend, I am incapable of acting any part unworthy of you, or myſelf.—But, ſaid I, where did you get acquainted with this man, for I am ſure I have never ſeen him at your houſe?—I have known him a long while, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied ſhe, and the reaſon of your not ſeeing him was, becauſe he was at the army at the time you viſited us. I became acquainted with him at the marchioneſs * * *, and ſhall one day or another tell you the hiſtory of our friendſhip; but at preſent give me leave to inform you, that he feels the ſtrongeſt paſſion for you. What part therefore will you have me act? Will you not take it amiſs if I receive his profeſſions to deliver them to you? Tell me how I can ſerve you. If this doth not pleaſe you, and his love is offenſive, I will have nothing more to ſay to him. My friend was much too hard for me. She wanted to know the diſpoſitions of my ſoul, and people in love are apt to be communicative, for theſe two ſentiments always go hand in hand. Beſides, ſhe was a fitter perſon to make a confidante of than Leonora, our ages agreeing better with one another. I therefore unboſomed my ſoul, and told her my ſecret upon honor not to mention a word of it to the duke, which ſhe promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:022876_0259_0FBA9CFA24A96FE0"/>
and I am willing to believe ſhe has kept her word with me. I informed her without reſerve of all I have related to you: my ſtory ſurpriſed and affected her much, and ſhe gave me new aſſurances of doing nothing but what I ſhould think fit.</p>
                  <p>The next day we took a walk at a ſmall diſtance from our ſeat. It was a very fine place. Whilſt we were abroad, prince Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millus came to pay us a viſit, but was told I was gone out. He thought, I ſuppoſe, that in the country one was always to be met with at home, and could not conceive, that having ſo large and fine a park, we ſhould go to ſeek a walk abroad. Yet, had he thought proper, he might have been ſatisfied of the truth. If he had but aſked the ſervants, they could have told him where I was. But, without mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the leaſt enquiry, he went away in a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and the next day ſent me the following letter.</p>
                  <p>"Love led me yeſterday to your ſolitude, Mademoiſelle, but even Cupid himſelf met with a diſappointment. I found nothing but a melancholy ſolitude, everything that could pleaſe was fled with you. However, do not fear that my complaints ſhall ever more come to diſturb your pleaſures. No; I value them as yours: though I cannot taſte any, where you are abſent, may you ſtill par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of a great deal where I am far off; proofs of love become offenſive when we are not in a diſpoſition to make them a ret<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>."</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="58" facs="unknown:022876_0260_0FBA9CFC9137EDB0"/>That very evening we took a walk by our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; my friend made me vaſt proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of friendſhip, and ſpoke with great ſenſibility of all I had mentioned to her. Our converſation was long and tender, but at laſt it grew late, and we were obliged to return homewards.</p>
                  <p>As we were walking back to the caſtle, I heard a noiſe near me, and was mightily ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed to find myſelf ſtopped by ſomebody that lay at my feet. I gave a ſhriek, upon which a voice, which I ſoon knew for the duke's, ſaid,—Do not be frightened, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, I am no enemy.—Yes, ſir, anſwered I, you muſt be one, cruelly thus to expoſe me.—You will not be expoſed, replied he; no body can know I am here, and your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation is dearer to me than my paſſion: but what can I do with the mighty ſtore of love you have inſpired me with?—I now turned to my friend, and aſked whether ſhe had a hand in this piece of treachery?—No, madam, anſwered he for her, ſhe has no manner of ſhare in what I do, and it is from the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and purity of my ſentiments alone I have borrowed this preſumption. He then threw himſelf again at my feet, and ſaid the moſt paſſionate things in the world. I would have got from him and called my friend, but could not ſtir, ſomething inviſible, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, too prevailing ſeized my ſoul, and my legs refuſed to perform their office. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately I had not power to ſpeak, and
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:022876_0261_0FBA9CFDD51CC518"/>
therefore only anſwered him with my heart, but my eyes would eaſily have betrayed their meaning, could he have ſeen them. In ſhort, he perſuaded me of his paſſion. Heavens! what did he not ſay, and how did it not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect me? But, at laſt, my friend informing us that day-light was approaching, and that we muſt part, he aſked leave to return again the next day. I had not power to deny him, and withdrew in a diſorder and agitation that cannot be expreſſed.</p>
                  <p>I paſſed the remainder of the night awake, and was never taken up with ſuch a variety of ſentiments: for joy, grief, hopes, fear, and remorſe, took their turns, and raiſed ſuch a ſtorm in my breaſt, that day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared before ſleep could approach my eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids.</p>
                  <p>I went very early to my friend's apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and finding her penſive and ſorrowful, enquired into the reaſon. I ſhall be loth to tell it you, anſwered ſhe, but yet I cannot betray the confidence you repoſe in me, and ſhould think myſelf wanting in my obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to you, if I did not acquaint you with the duke's engagements. What! cried I, has he then placed his affections elſewhere? Perhaps that is all over, replied ſhe; you are capable of effacing the deepeſt impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but, however, hear me out if you can: I am going to reveal to you his ſecret and my own.—Sure, ſaid I, it is not you that he is in love with?—No, madam, replied ſhe
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:022876_0262_0FBA9CFF5743F690"/>
haſtily, compoſe yourſelf and hear me; for you muſt know the bottom, in order to take the courſe that can fit you beſt.—</p>
                  <p>I have known the duke ſome time. He was ſomewhat forward in courting an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with me, and got one of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations to introduce him. I was aſtoniſhed that a man of his youth, and ſo taken up with gay pleaſures, ſhould come to ſeek a perſon much retired, and who thought more of leading a rational life, than one diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with mirth and gaiety. I enquired therefore into his views, and ſelf-love made me believe, that, not being a bad match as to fortune, they might relate to me. But I was not long in that error. You know there's a friendſhip between madam L * * * and me. She is very amiable. I ſuſpected his aſſiduity at our houſe might be meant for her, and accordingly, by often talking to him about her, and telling him all the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome things I could think of her, I was ſoon convinced that his fondneſs was all intended for that friend. The diſcovery nettled me a little; I avoided ſome time enquiring why, and my heart would fain have ſpared me an inſight into my weakneſs; but, as I feared its ſurpriſes, I was not deceived, and thought I muſt apply the neceſſary remedies.</p>
                  <p>At firſt I made a reſolution never to ſee him more. Alas! it would have proved more for my ſatisfaction, had I followed this,
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:022876_0263_0FBA9D00EA6DF810"/>
than the conduct I afterwards impoſed upon myſelf.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, fancying I could do ſtill better, I ſet about wreſting his ſecret from him, and was even at the advance of the whole ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe of the confidence, by telling him the misfortune I had had to loſe the Marquis ***, with whom my family had entered into ſome engagements relating to a match between us; how ſenſibly I had been affected with the breaking off of the intended alliance; with what regret I forbid him my doors, when decency and the commands of my relations would no longer allow of his viſits; how much this conduct increaſed my paſſion; and how I found by experience, that ſeverity ſerves love, and ſtrengthens the impreſſion. I made him this confidence, with a view of placing an eternal obſtacle between him and my own heart. I likewiſe gave by this a pretence and excuſe to my ſorrow, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to another, the effects of my paſſion for him.</p>
                  <p>This confidence diſpleaſed him; whether it was contrary to his deſigns, or that his vanity had been flattered with the belief that my heart inclined to him; but yet I thought I perceived he had ſome ſecret views, and would have it in his power to attempt me when he ſhould think fit.—It is pretty much the way of the men to have ſome object in reſerve, after letting their imaginations rove,
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:022876_0264_0FBA9D040B5BD258"/>
and loſing their taſte for their preſent plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</p>
                  <p>My confidence had quite a contrary effect to what I imagined, for he became eager and fond. He was inconſolable, as he ſaid, at my having ſuch ſentiments for another; and when I told him, that it took nothing from him, he thought me guilty of want of delicacy in not underſtanding there were paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of eſteem infinitely above thoſe of the ſenſes. The truth was, I wanted no other from him, but the difficulty lay in convincing me that his was of that kind. Whatever he could ſay, I did not believe him the more for it, and there were even ſome moments when I eſteemed him the leſs on that account. He continued always in the ſame ſtrain, and, had I been willing to flatter my ſelf-love, I might have believed that I had inſpired him with a very ſublime paſſion. But this did not ſatisfy me; I wanted to come to ſome concluſion, and fix my ſituation by his.</p>
                  <p>Many ways offered to that end. I was miſtreſs of his ſecret. He had intruſted me with his repoſe, had deſired me to direct him; and I could without treachery, act a part con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with my intereſt, by refuſing to ſerve him in his amour. Another would have taken the opportunity to be revenged of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference given to a rival, and nothing was eaſier than this, for my friend was timorous; ſhe was afraid of the world and her family; ſhe feared the duke himſelf, and I had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:022876_0265_0FBA9D067A3F4528"/>
to do but to indulge her in her own way.</p>
                  <p>A more worthy conduct, however, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented itſelf at the ſame time. I kept off all the low reſentments we women are ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible of. I examined his caſe and my own, and did not find him guilty in feeling for another, what I could have wiſhed he had felt for me. I thought it was my buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to puniſh myſelf for a miſplaced affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by turning it to his advantage, and that my affection ought to be pure and powerful enough to be aſſiſting in making him more happy in another. I laid aſide all my tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and forgot my own intereſt, in order to impoſe upon myſelf the moſt difficult conduct in the world which, however, I have hitherto been able to keep up to. I fancied, that if he could be touched by an honorable behaviour, I ſhould thereby make a worthy friend of him; and that, however, if it was all loſt upon him, it would not be ſo for me. In ſhort, my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded imagination has ſerved him ſo well, that it has been able to perſuade me, that nothing would be more worthy of me than to conquer myſelf.</p>
                  <p>I therefore ſet about advancing his intereſt with my friend, as if on their happineſs the whole of mine had depended. I ſpoke to lady L*** of the great paſſion he had for her. I painted it in the ſtrongeſt colours, and drew a picture, ſketched by truth, but
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:022876_0266_0FBA9D07917E0700"/>
ornamented by love. My friend was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what prepoſſeſſed againſt him, but I found means to combat her prejudices. I calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her fears; I anſwered for him; I took all upon myſelf; I touched her heart; I moved her inclination to tenderneſs, and relieved her modeſty. In ſhort, when he came to ſee her, he had nothing to do, but to finſh what I had ſo well begun. He found the impreſſion ready made to his hands.</p>
                  <p>There were, indeed, ſome moments when I could not help thinking the part I had act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very much out of character. "I am wanting to every thing, ſaid I; I act againſt my own principles; I forget the regard I owe to myſelf, and know no other duty, but that of expreſſing my attachment to him. What a ſcene is this for indifferent people to ſee?" —Yet when I conſulted my heart and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I thought there could be nothing greater than to give him up to another. I judged of the merit of my conduct by what it coſt me. Thus, without regard to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, without the leaſt tender concern for my own ſituation, I have admitted no thought, but that of effecting his happineſs.</p>
                  <p>There was a time when I hoped to enjoy the ſad comfort of ſeeing him no more: he ſeemed to have taken ſome diſguſt, and I adviſed him to break off with my friend and me. That was leſs cruel, in my opinion, than the labourious taſk I had taken upon me. Indeed I ſuſpected he was at this time in love
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:022876_0267_0FBA9D091E3EEB80"/>
with madam C * * * *, but he would not own it.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while I was attentive to every thing that happened. I watched all his ſteps and motions, and was ready to magnify eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fault he committed, through the deſire I had of finding him guilty; and indeed I was not in humour to invent excuſes for him.</p>
                  <p>But, at laſt, after an eclairciſſement, he was reconciled, and became fonder than ever of my friend. I now found how cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it was to know the object of our affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions attached to ſomething perfect; yet, far from allowing my intereſt to encroach on the juſtice I owed my friend, my delicacy, and fear of being wanting to her, increaſed her merit with me. Ever ſince they admitted me into their confidence, I cannot reproach myſelf with having once thought of what would have been for my own advantage. All my advice has been ſincere, and has ſerved their intereſts againſt my own heart; ſo that the greateſt paſſion that ever was, has all along been ſubſervient to friendſhip. I have thought only of conquering my incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and puniſhing myſelf for a paſſion, which it was not in my power to ſuppreſs, ſince the heart involuntarily yields to impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
                  <p>On a time, the like would fain have perſuaded me he had changed his mind, and was always telling me things very much to my friend's diſadvantage. This loſt him my

eſteem. He redoubled his complaiſance to me: when ſhe was preſent, he would ſeem fonder of me, than of her: he offered me a preference which might have flattered my vanity. He followed me in all places; he grew jealous of every thing that came near me, and his jealouſy was real, for he would have been very unwilling to loſe me. But he conducted a paſſion and a deſign alike; a perſon leſs upon her guard might have miſtaken the one for the other, but my mind could ſee all his faults, though my heart was not yet ſenſible of them.—</p>
                  <p>If I had not ſpoke, during this long nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, it was becauſe I really had not power to do it; and my friend, quite intent upon her ſtory, had not taken notice of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition I was in all the while. But now, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to bear any longer, I gave a ſhriek, and cried out,—It is enough. O! tell me no more;—and with that, the violent conſtraint I had put upon myſelf, having quite exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my ſpirits, I ſunk down in a ſwoon, and was a long while in the arms of my women without recovering from my fit; but, to my misfortune, they recalled me at laſt to life.</p>
                  <p>Scarce had I opened my eyes, and began to recover my ſpirits, but a great noiſe and buſtle was heard about the houſe, and ſome of my maids left me to run and ſee what it might be. But as they did not return, and the loud cries continued, I leaned upon the arm of one of them, and ſtaggered towards
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:022876_0269_0FBA9D0E0B2CAFF0"/>
the place from whence they proceeded. Juſt as I got to the hall, I ſaw four men bringing in another bathed in his blood, whom, as he turned his head towards me, I knew to be the prince. This ſight almoſt rivetted me to the ground; but, making an effort, I moved forwards to follow the mournful ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle. They laid him on a couch in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and I made ſigns to the ſervants to run for help, for I could ſcarce ſpeak. The prince ſeeing me, turned his expiring eyes towards me, and ſaid,—I have not been able to touch your heart, madam, nor convince you of my love: I ſhall, however, die con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, if in my laſt moments I can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade you that no one ever loved you ſo truly as I have, though a more happy man puts me in the condition I am now in.—At this inſtant the eyes of all preſent, who were not a few, flaſhed upon me with indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but I was yet more hateful to myſelf than to them; and Leonora, who came run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at the noiſe, ſeeing my condition, drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged me away from this diſmal ſight.</p>
                  <p>I was led up to my chamber. I begged of her, however, to go and take care of the prince, and to ſend away with all expedition for the ableſt ſurgeons that could be got. They had already taken care of that, and as we were not at a great diſtance from town, they were not long in coming. They examined his wounds, and found them mortal I ſent every moment to know his condition, but
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:022876_0270_0FBA9D101598F610"/>
could ſee very well by the looks of my wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that there was no hopes of him.</p>
                  <p>My friend came at laſt, and, by the grief ſhe expreſſed, I gueſſed the prince's condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. —It is the duke, ſaid ſhe to me, that has fought him,—Can you, anſwered I, be the bearer of ſuch cruel news:—Why, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied ſhe, you muſt be informed of what is become a public talk, that you may be able to regulate yourſelf accordingly.—Though ſhe was in the right, I could not help think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her cruel to talk ſo; but grief is often unjuſt. I begged her to return to the prince's aſſiſtance, and not to leave him.</p>
                  <p>I then withdrew to my cloſet, with one of my women, in whom I confided moſt, and, throwing myſelf on a couch, ſaid, "I have nothing more to do in this world, and yet am not allowed to bring death to my relief! What a cruelty to be obliged to ſupport life under ſuch circumſtances!—But, come; I have always depended upon your attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to me; follow me. I can no longer endure the ſight of human kind.—Whither, madam, muſt we go? replied ſhe.—No mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter where, anſwered I, provided I avoid the eyes of all my acquaintance." The girl en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to oppoſe my deſign, but to no purpoſe. I opened a door on the back ſtairs that led to the garden, and was going out, when ſhe ſtopped me, by telling me how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper it would be to go away with the cloaths I had on, and all my jewels about me, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:022876_0271_0FBA9D115E8DF9C8"/>
me to ſtay at leaſt till ſhe had dreſſed me in one of her plaineſt ſuits. I was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, and bid her make haſte, not being able to tarry a moment longer in this fatal houſe. "But, will you not wait the utmoſt of the prince's fate, reſumed ſhe again, and muſt not that, madam, regulate your deſtiny? —Alas, anſwered I, doſt thou not hear the diſmal ſhrieks of the whole family, too ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive of his not having one moment longer to live."</p>
                  <p>Saying theſe words, I flew down ſtairs. We paſſed the garden without meeting any body, and got out by a back door that open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a large wood. The day was begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to cloſe: I walked ſome time without uttering a word: ſhame and fear ſunk all my ſpirits. At laſt, quite ſpent and overcome, I fell to the ground, and leaned my head on the lap of the woman that attended me. The poor creature was inconſolable to ſee me in that condition. She ſpoke, but I neither anſwered, nor hearkened to her. The night grew dark and diſmal. Overpowered by grief and wearineſs, I fell aſleep as I lay, for nature will take care of herſelf, and will loſe nothing of her dues.</p>
                  <p>I opened my eyes juſt as the day began to break, and my misfortunes glaring afreſh with the light, I was filled with horror when I ſaw them diſtinctly. I recalled them all to my mind. I loſe an accompliſhed prince,
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:022876_0272_0FBA9D12E21288C0"/>
ſaid I; I have not loved him, when his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, meeting with a return of mine, might have made us happy, and I adore him now I am on the point of loſing him! Mercileſs love means to revenge him, and make me the object of its moſt cruel perſecutions.— And by what hand do I loſe him? By the hand of a perfidious man, who perhaps, has never loved me. I have been the victim of his vanity. My life, my reputation, all is to be enveloped in the odium of guilt. I ſhall be confounded with thoſe of my ſex, who have forſaken glory and forfeited their honor. What a heart-breaking ſtory for a father, whoſe delight and darling I once was? But in what condition muſt the prince's mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be, ſhe who lived but for him? Muſt it be my fate to involve ſo many people in my misfortunes? Why do I fly? It would be too happy for me to be ſacrificed to their juſt reſentment."—And, indeed, in ſome moments, I was for going back to offer my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to their fury, but then again, ſhame getting the better of my deſperate reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I could think of nothing but hiding myſelf from their eyes, and ſeeking ſome forlorn cave where I might ſpend the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of my days.—"But after all, ſaid I again to myſelf, what is my crime, good God! thou knoweſt the bottom of all hearts. An involuntary paſſion hath entered my ſoul. I have rejected and oppoſed its gratificatica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:022876_0273_0FBA9D146012BD38"/>
I never have tranſgreſſed my duty nor modeſty. What then am I puniſhed for?"</p>
                  <p>The young woman that bore me company, was all this while melting into tears. "Alas, madam, ſaid ſhe, what reſolution are you taking? So fair and ſo young, what are you not going to expoſe yourſelf to?—Perhaps, replied I, I ſhall meet with ſome friendly vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain who will deprive me of a life, which the Deity orders me to retain as a puniſhment. No, anſwered ſhe, you can find no enemies amongſt men: but if you will be ruled by me, I have a ſiſter ſettled in a ſmall town not far off; I will conduct you to her; you will not be known, and will be leſs diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able there, than thus wandering about from place to place."</p>
                  <p>I took her advice; we ſet out, and in a little time arrived at the place, whither ſhe deſigned to carry me. Her ſiſter received us very kindly; I went for her friend, as it had been agreed between us; I found them buſy in marrying one of their children. But, on the wedding-day, as I did not chooſe to be ſeen by the company, I went out early in the morning, with my companion, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of taking an airing, and, walking by the edge of a little hill, I ſaw a wood. I took a fancy to go into it, and perceiving a hutt, which my friend told me was an her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitage, I went up to it, and found it open. A ſhepherd, that was attending his flock
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:022876_0274_0FBA9D17945EFF10"/>
near the place, informed us, that the hermit, who uſed to inhabit it, was thought to be lately dead in going his rounds about the country. Upon this information, I ſtepped in, and finding it convenient for my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, cried out immediately to my maid, "This is a dwelling kind fortune offers me; here I am determined to ſpend the remainder of my ſorrowful days." I have accordingly put my project in execution, and, to this day, ladies, no body but you have been here to interrupt my ſolitude and grief.</p>
